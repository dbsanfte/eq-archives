    Until recently, tipping 500 pp and buying materials for armour that I
have to sell to a sub-optimal race/class combination (no Rallos Zek dwarf
warriors, so no Heraldic for them!) would have been folly I couldn't afford.
It's only since I got the Shei shears and a pile of superb/flawless
rockhopper hides that I've been making steady cash. Given the constraints on
my time due to raiding, most XP is done wherever the XP is most efficient,
NOT wherever the loot is best. And Luclin, in general, has a lack of
droppables you can sell for cash that drop in raid areas.

    Not the old stuff. The new stuff sells nicely, when you can find a
buyer. Our server's leading smith, Zopharr (max skill smith on his dwarf
cleric main, maybe four points from max skill smith on his ogre SK alt) has
made maybe a score or so of Underfoot plate items, mostly bracers. If I look
around at a raid I bet I could count a score of visible Heraldic plate
pieces on warriors.
