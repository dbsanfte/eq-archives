Sorry, didn't know you were a pathetic loser, read the rest of my post, 
you'll see what I mean =)
And if you can't see, you need some good psychological help, but I'll 
give you a hint: your whole post is made of insults on some ppl you 
don't know, or that you might know but only from a game (there are other 
points you can find yourself to prove yourself you don't need 
psychological help~). What did they do to you, honestly? Does the fact 
that they are dumb(assumed) really bother you? :p
I'm not trying to defend them, and I know they are far from being all 
clean, but I don't see the point of insulting them like that, even if 
they would deserve it, which i'm sure it's not the case. You need to get 
a life or something man, no offense :p

ps: Hopefully you'll read it this time,no i ain't a FoH member, and yeah 
i'm proud of my name and my attitude =) you're not happy? deal with it 
or leave it. thanks~ (will probably be my last post in this topic)
