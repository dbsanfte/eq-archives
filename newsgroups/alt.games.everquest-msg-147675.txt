A corpse will not Zone. If it is on a ship when the Ship Zones the Corpse is
left at the Zone line. Best thing to do is Petition or pay a Necro to summon
it. 1 other option is the get a couple chipped bone rods (3 charges of
Locate Corpse) and go for a swim in OOT every now and then click on the rod
it will point you in the direction of the Corpse.
