Reputation is incredibly important . Both the creme and the scum tend to
rise to the top and soon everyone recognizes which is which . For an example
chubbies a monk on the server I play on has a reputation for obnoxious oocs
and shouts . He is a decent player otherwise and does not act dishonorably
otherwise . Even so he cannot get a guild and has been a very lonely 60th
monk for a very long time . Hes good enough to group with but no one wants a
long term association with him .

If reputation is so important in a marginal case like him think how bad it
can be if for a real scum .
