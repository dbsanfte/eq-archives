    There's other zones where fear kiting pathing got messed up a bit. It
wasn't just the correction of the Justice exploit, which was A Good Thing.

    Not Dire Charm, but the charm nerfs did smack a whole bunch of
necromancers. Now they're reduced to kiting reds in Fire for obscene XP, as
opposed to killing all of CoD for profane XP. But the reds are a whole
different issue. My guild has at least three melee mains that have bought
caster alts and use them to PL the main by killing those reds - it's better
XP than grouping.
