Hmmm...watched someone use EQW at work, on a 650 MHz Athlon (one of
the old slot A models, about a year old) with an OK but not
spectacular card (TNT2 M63, I believe), and he got good performance.
In fact, I watched him play for a while, and didn't even notice it was
in a window for quit a while, until I saw the title bar at the top of
the screen.
