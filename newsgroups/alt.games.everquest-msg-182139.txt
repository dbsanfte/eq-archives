When SOE first officially put in the ability to alt-tab out of EQ,
there was a news article on Caster's Realm (eq.castersrealm.com. Just
browse through the news history a couple months) about a fix for WinXP
users. It seems WinXP kindly coded in a list of programs that
alt-tabbing out of didn't work properly, either due to the program
crashing from it or whatnot, such as EQ (at the time WinXP was
released). There's an admin tool utility (Official MS program) linked
to on CR's website that you can use to disable entries in that list.
Grab it, find EQ (The news article on CR walks you through that),
disable the entry, and you should be good to go.
