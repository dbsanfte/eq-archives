If someone (a non-newbie...sorry, anyone under 14 that asks for SoW without
a really good reason are beggars) asked for SoW like that and is
/target'able WILL get a SoW at the very least unless I'm truly "busy right
now."  Teleports, otoh...I'll often say I'm busy when I'm not, though if
someone is THAT polite - assuming the person isn't level 25 or lower - I'll
probably do it anyway if it's at all convenient.  If I'm in BFE and bound in
FV (typical) I'm not going to port someone and then run 3+ zones back to
what I was doing.

My reply is "no, of course not" when I deign to reply at all.
