Run speed 3 is on all the time (indoors) and is a 30% increase in speed

SoW (outdoors) is 34% (level 9) - 55% (level 50)
SoE (outdoors) is 57% (level 54) - 60% (level 60)

That said, Soe is worse that SoW if you ask me, levitating all the time
makes me sick :)
I use Spirit of Bih'li mainly, which is SoW with 15 Atk (group spell), or i
use my SoW boots (black fur) if that drops

That said, there is a new spell, apparently for the new expansion:

Spirit of the shrew (30%) at level 29 (indoors and outdoors)
29 SHM / DRU 34

This looks like runs speed 3 for level 30s.
