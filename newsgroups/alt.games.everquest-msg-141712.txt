Wow...that is silly.  Wizards use AE snare because its all we got, and it is
high enough mana that for quad kitting, we need to hit more than one mob at
a time.  So, a quadding Wizard, unless he's got a lot more +mana items than
average, or some serious mana regen, has to aggro all his mobs, and gather
them up into a group, with the mobs running at full speed, and then snare
them.  Snaring the mobs first, then gathering them, is bad because of the
high mana cost, and the fact that our AE snare doesn't last very long, so it
will need to be cast *again* after they are gathered, costing another 115
mana or whatever.  No one would do this unless they *have* to do it.

Druids have that wonderful 10 minute snare, so they can snare each mob to
pull it, and gather them up for quadding in safety.  I can't see why a Druid
would ever want to use the AE snare for quadding.

I can construct some far-fetched situations where an AE snare is actually
more useful than casting a non-AE snare three or four times, but I can't
think of anything likely.
