Oh fer cry-eye lighten up a bit, will ya?  This whole thread you've
been really touchy about some pretty minor bullshit.  If you're that
offended by my lighthearted little jabs then either killfile me or
accept this as a sort of left-handed apology, I certainly wasn't
trying to get you upset.

left-handed and neither proud nor ashamed of it, as it is no more a
virtue or a vice than tallness, pinkness, cleverness.
