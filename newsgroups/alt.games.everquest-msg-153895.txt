Cheer all you like about how much Monks, Mags, and Wizzies needed to
get nerfed cause you WILL be next. Clerics didn't get nerfed, a spell
did but only slightly, they and enchanters remain the fair haired
children of VI. Wizzies and Mags got hit in the end game and looks
like monks take on the chin no matter what the level. Realize Im not
taking the banner of any one class, I play several 50+ chars which
makes this nerf even more unsettling. People have worked hard to level
these chars to get the very abilites that may get yanked, yeah cheer
long and hard geeks.

Rouges : Broken beyond all belief and the root of the melee class
probs. May come sooner than you think. Oops we really didn't mean for
you to BS from the front and that whole chain idea was a mistake....

Rangers: Enjoy the damage you deal now cause soon it will become
outside the VI "vision" of EQ. Oops we really didn't mean for you to
cast "and" tank "and" deal high damage.....

Bards: Enjoy the twists now cause some day they will be gone. Oops you
mean bards can sing more than one song at a time? Unbalancing....

The list goes on and on of things that can become "outside" this very
flexible "vision".

Who is next? Who cares but soon it will be you no matter what class
you play.

The one thing that wont get nerfed are the mobs, they look fairly
safe, or maybe not...

Let em know what ya really think, let PoP collect dust on shelves. But
that's just my opinion I could be wrong.
