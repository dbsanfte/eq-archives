It works fine.  It even fixed a problem I was having.  Normally when you
alt-enter to window mode the gamma goes dark but fixes itself when you go
back full screen.  But when I went back full screen then the gamma was dark
again and would only go normal in windowed mode or if I restarted.   After
dx9 the problem went away.  This was with an ati 9700.
