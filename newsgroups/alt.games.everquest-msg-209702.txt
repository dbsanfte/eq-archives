/agree

Dont know why anybody would make anything out of this at all, doesnt take
your mana, doesnt take your exp, you dont even have to click anything, just
carry on with what you were doing, tell them sorry, I dont want to group
with you (if you feel the need), and move on.

Of course there may be a forum somewhere for the "Random Invite Hell Has
Ruined My Life In EQ!!!"

Of which, bizbee is probably the only poster.
