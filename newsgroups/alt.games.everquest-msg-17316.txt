Shaman at higher levels only get better.  You'll find that all along
your buffs and other magical abilities will get you groups if you'd
like, and as time goes on your slow and dot spells only make this more
so.  On the other hand, if you take the time (and the deaths <g>) to
learn how to use your powers, you can also solo up through some very
high levels.  I was burning through the 40s at a lvl a night soloing,
but that was only possible because of all the times I died in my 20s and
30s hehe.  Experience is a great teacher and once you learn what doesn't
work you'll find that you have a great combination of spells for
soloing.  Despite that ability, group dynamics still are more fun IMO.
