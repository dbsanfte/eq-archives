Looks like Absor isn't the only one at Verant with his head up his ass. It
appears to be a condition of employment.

Check out how he reacts to a question about monsters flying through trees as
if they aren't there. It's as if it hasn't even occurred to him that they
*shouldn't*. Confirming once again that the people at Verant do not actually
*play* EverQuest...

I'll be *so* glad when some of these other graphical online RPGs get up and
running. At least there's a *chance* that one of them will be competently
designed.
