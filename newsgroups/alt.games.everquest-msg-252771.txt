Ok, so I finally bit the bullet and started two boxing a new Warrior.
(Our guild is in desperate need of a dedicated meat shield.) It's been
quite a while since I last played a warrior. There are these
newfangled things called Combat Abilities (and I gather something
called Disciplines too.) I went through the tutorial, and got my charm
up to full, and was taught something called Throw Stone. Fairly neat.
An autoatic unresistable 1 point of damage with minor agro every 10
seconds.

Anyway, most people would say it's farely useless after about level 5
or so, because you practically have to be inside agro radius of most
mobs to use it and it only does a single point of damage. On the other
hand it's almost free to use (apparently) and over the course of a
battle that might be 10 points of damage. (I have lost a battle by
less than 10 points before.) Also it just might possibly pull a MOB
off of a caster one fraction of a second sooner than not using it.

Soooo. I want to use it, but it's not important enough to have to
click it seperately. I want to include it in the same social I have
Kick and Taunt in. Is there some way to do that? (I suppose if not,
you can bind a hot key location to a key on the key board. How do you
do that?)

The tutorial mentions other things like Throw Stones, that use the
Endurence bar. Any place to locate that information? I'm not having
much luck locating any.

Also all the Warrior guides I can find around on the net are
apparently very out of date. Can anyone fill me in on what's changed
since pre-Luclin, warrior wise? (Big question I know.) =)

Thanks, in advance.
