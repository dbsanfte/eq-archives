Level isn't the issue for bazaar, cash is.

You won't find much stuff you'll want there under a plat. As a rule of
thumb, for low-level types, expect to spend at least 2-3pp per item. If
you're still sweating bullets over those 4gp spells, don't bother. If
you've amassed 8pp, rush on up and buy a few items.  You'll likely be
aghast at what you can afford to buy in bazaar for a few plat, especially
when compared to what NPC merchants will charge you for *vastly* inferior
gear...

The other reason to go to bazaar would be if you have something worth
selling. Spider silks and spiderling silks I've seen sell for as much as
5pp *each*! An enterprising newbie could easily finance his first 10 levels
of spells and equipment while levelling up on spiderlings. Low, Medium,
and High Quality pelts can also be sold to players for much more than
merchants will pay.
