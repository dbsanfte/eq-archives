When OoW came out, several people in a.g.e said that the Tasks feature need=
ed tuning, as it would often send a player on impossibly difficult missions=
  I'd like to buy OoW, mainly for the Tasks, but if they're still broken I=
'll hold off.

Are people finding that the Tasks work as advertised now?

Thanks for any information.
