It's not increasing. the rape rate in the US peaked in 1992 at abour
42 per 1000. In 2000 it's down to 32 per 1000. Still not good, but
getting better.

Where are those figures? You haven't produced them. And they way you
snipped me is fairly deceptive, making it look like I produced a
survey while you produced hard numbers. Please keep the entire quote
if you;re going to quote me. Soi far, all you've put out is a
different survey.

No, it's because violent crime is on the rise in Britain while it's on
a decline in the US. And it's been climbing out of control in the UK
since the 80s. Hmmmmm

Go ahead. You so far haven't done a very good job.
