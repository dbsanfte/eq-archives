It was for a long time considered to be the path of least resistance. The
easiest method to get from 1-50 in a hurry. The easy method of gaining
experience does not gain you equipment , and also does not teach you how to
handle grouping in hard places. This resulted in a crowd of people
underequipped and having no grouping skills being dumped on the rest of us
at the high end. They get us killed , we get mad, we call them names :p

Also of note is that this group of people are only followers . They did not
do the exploring on their own and tend to be the whiner class of eq. We dont
have enough to do that , we need more clerics , Im not getting my fair share
of your loot , no one deserves equipment like that !
