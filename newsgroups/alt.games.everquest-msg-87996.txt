I scored EverQuest today...installed it, and the two expansions (Shadows
comes later)...but this autopatching when I first log in is a nightmare.

The download gets partial through...then just stops...if I cancel, it doesnt
resume..starts all over again..and then stops. Been through this process
about 4 times now. Is there a place I can manually score the patch?


Is this normal guys?

Pete
