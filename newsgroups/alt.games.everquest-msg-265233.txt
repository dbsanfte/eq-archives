AC achieved this at the cost of both everything looking like shit *and* 
looking pretty much the same all over the world. If AC had to stream off 
the disk the same amount of zone-specific model and texture data that EQ 
has, the chugging would be unacceptable. 

Obviously, I'd love to see a game with both the graphical richness and 
variety of EQ *and* seamless continent-sized areas, but I don't think 
that's going to happen before some serious technological breakthroughs 
on hard drive bandwidth.
