}I've been doing a lot of reading on fletching forems because I have been
}doing the Trueshot Bow quest lately. One of the posts was from someone who
}kept track of how much it cost him to get his fletching skill to 200+<800
}pp> and had sold a total of 12 bows at ~200 pp each.

Well, there's the problem.  He went all the way to 200... You can get to 
160ish for about 300pp.  You'll then succeed at Trueshot about half the 
time, which is enough.  

}If you break it down, it just doesn't pay even when you follow the Verant
}party line of making money in trades by selling to other people. The only
}character type really good at the quest is a ranger since you are tracking
}runaway clockworks for servos, a no drop and fairly rare drop.

Yeah, but it's realy not that hard to find enough clockworks.  And rogue 
clockworks also drop the servos.  Any newbie gnome is bound to end up with 
a few, and the trueshot is partially multiquestable.  One character can 
quest for the bow staff and then hand it off to the fletcher.  Fletcher 
pays character #1 some reasonable consideration, makes bow, and sells.  
That way, the fletcher can use up his servos half as quickly, and the 
non-fletcher can get rid of the @#$%! servo he has no use for for a 
reasonable profit.

}I haven't
}seen anyone talking about making a ranger mule, twinking them with 2000 pp
}and enough wis items to get to 200 wis

Totally unnecessary.  Give him about 500pp and enough to get to 80-90 wis.  
Yes, I did that.  I was making all these trueshots, I might as well have a 
ranger.  Now I can hunt brownie parts in Gfay. :)

}so I assume everyone is in the same
}boat: Trying to do something other then make a trade mule. You could do it
}with a druid, but then the druid couldn't use the bows they made which IMO
}is just another kind of mule.

Hmm.  And an enchanter doing it is...?  Trying to support a serious 
Jewelcrafting addiction. :)

}So you spend dozens of hours a week hunting low level mobs that don't give
}loot or exp. At the end, if you are really successful you may make enough
}bows to break even. There isn't a lot of satisfaction or pp that can be
}derived from this situation.

I dunno, I made quite a profit at it, and it really didn't take all that 
long.
