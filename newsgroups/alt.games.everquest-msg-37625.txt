The rez cost a lot more mana resulting in alot more downtime than a port
creates. Between rezzing and healing and buffing I expend alot of mana. BTW
if I am doing the rez for free or no pp is ofered I usually won't buff them,
I will heal them unless of course they act like the arse I once rezzed that
says to me after I rezzed him, "oh I guess now you expect payment for your
services just like all the other cleric assholes" I gated and left him there
half dead...

Tell me, how is demanding 100p for a port being any more of an "ass"
than demanding 100p for a rez? As so many others have said, "There is
ZERO difference"....
