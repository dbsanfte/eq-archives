I don't play EQ myself (too broke) but I've built/upgraded a number of
systems earlier this year for friends to play EQ on. I also have
service/maintenance contracts on all of them. I got these frantic calls this
week "I gotta have a new computer...EQ updates... yada yada...HELP!"

The systems are all at least Celeron 533MHz with 128 MB RAM in all of them.
All run Win98 w/DX7.0a. They are all using onboard AGP graphics except one
that is running a 12 MB Monster2. These systems have been working rather
well with EQ... until this week. My understanding is that the new expansion
pack is requiring some major hardware upgrades.

Now, let me see if I've got this straight... Do I understand correctly that
even if someone does NOT intend on using the new expansion, they must
*still*  upgrade their hardware?

I am assuming that I need to throw another 256MB stick of SDRAM, a GeForce
64MB PCI card and upgrade to DX8 in each and they should be fine??

Then, what about the sound? Also, all are running onboard audio (sound isn't
really that important to them). Can it just be disabled if the onboard
chipset isn't DX8 compatible? I guess I could find some OEM SB live cards on
ebay...

Also, one system has been going to a blue screen saying "Windows graphics
failure" followed by an extremely dim display. If you cold boot and let
scandisk run, it's fine the rest of the day. If you skip the scandisk, the
video crashes again. This started since the upgrade patch on Wed morning
IIRC. Sounds like a conflict with the patch to me.

And here's another problem... I have (mostly) USR Sportster ISA v.90
hardware modems with very stable  48-53k connects, average 100-140 pings and
very little, if any, lag. Since the patching started, they now connect at
19200 - 24000 and this *really* ticks me off. I use the EXACT same modems
and the EXACT same ISP and POP number on my own systems (no EQ) with
absolutely no difference in connectivity whatsoever, so that *definately*
points to the EQ patches. Another system is on a cable modem and he said his
throughput has been *quartered* since he patched EQ this week. I'd really
like to know what's up with that!

Now, these people aren't getting any richer in this economy and *all* have
told me that they will just cancel their EQ accounts if the cost to upgrade
is too high. I can't blame them. If it was me. I'd have cancelled already. I
think the HW requirements are rather drastic for a game, especially one that
you have to KEEP paying for to play. It's not like you can just switch to
single player mode!

Verant is going to lose a LOT of players over this. But perhaps that is
their intention. Perhaps they figure that the lowly "working poor" are worth
sacrificing in the name of reducing bandwidth costs. My bet stands that
those who have just paid for 6 months will not get a refund if they can no
longer play after Monday.
