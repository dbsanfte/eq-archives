Well, when you zoned, you could have sat down and memmed it? The best
cure I get is counteract disease - the one you shamans get at 24 - and
I've used counteract poison to cure Trak's dot by casting it a couple
times. Plague and poison breath have 9 counters of disease/poison
respectively, and counteract spells can remove 8 in one cast.
