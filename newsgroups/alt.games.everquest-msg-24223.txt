With what?
Nature's Touch?  You think a level 60 cleric is gonna live for 6.5
seconds after he aggros a dragon?

Or Cholorblast?  That's less than the bash damage from a dragon.

Sorry, if the cleric can't fire DA/DB after pissing off a dragon, he's
dead.  Nothing I can do the change it.  The best I can do is heal some
of the "minor" damage they take from AoEs (which they often can resist
outright if they paid attention to their resist gears).

Mobs at major raids often quad for 600+ and flurry.  That makes
healing non-defensive warriors a largely moot point.  If they win
aggro, they need to have some discipline to keep them alive or have
DA/DB spell/idol.  Otherwise, it's naked at bind point for them.

This is why aggro control is about 99% of the game in major raids.
