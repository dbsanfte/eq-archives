So what?  They have less of a life than you do and spend all their time
playing? (that was a joke ok?)

I took up fletching first so I could make my own arrows.  Kind of an expensive
venture for me as a newbie with no cash.  I didn't learn baking, pottery, etc.,
until I decided to do the Thurgadin shawl quests.  I *only* started THAT quest
to learn how to make the Thurgadin gate potion, (so my ranger could actually
escape if she got in trouble somewhere).  That said...
It was at about your level that I moved to the Great Divide and Eastern
Wastelands.  You will need that great gear against the monsters there.  I love
those zones.  Great big outdoor spaces.   Tracking is king here.  I started out
playing at the bridge to Iceclad in EW fear kiting animals.  I find that kind
of dull, so for a change of pace there is a nice little orc camp just north of
the bridge.  Forage all the time.  Those *tufts of dire wolf fur* sell for 50
plat each on Tholuxe Paells.   When that gets dull the Rygorr Keep is directly
west of the iceclad bridge, you should be able to track on the RyGorr Chief or
Elite Centaurions to get you right there.  You will have to harmony pull to get
the centaurions one at a time.  Northwest of there is the Frost Giant Fortress.
 Same thing, use harmony to pull.  
Then there are the ulthorks to the north.  In Great Divide there are Tizmacks,
Frost Giants and Shardwurms.
Explore!  It's the greatest thing about being a ranger.  You can track anything
and know whether you should stay and kill or run like a madman for another
zone.
