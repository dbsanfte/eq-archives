Hi all,

I have heavily customized the text colors, window positions, etc. but am
having trouble getting my window transparencies to stick. The one i am
interested in is /wincolor BUFF 0 0 0 0, and each time i re-log in ANY
transparenecies are back to the defaults.

Does anyone know where/how to set this in the EQCLIENT.INI file?

Thanks -D
