Well it is a new worl, with a fresh economy and an untapped endgame.
So, the mudflation will be put on hold for a while, and the economy
won't become a runaway freight train.

Also, the mobs won't have the escalating arms race that currently
occurs in EQ, where a rat from one of the new zones could kick the ass
of an old-world dragon.

So, its fresh, its new, and there are some uncharted waters,
beta-players excepeted.  Get in early and enjoy before it heads south.
