Um, pardon my skepticism, but why would "an ass kissing whore that
flirts with everyone in the game" be playing a male dwarf character?
I would think someone who was a "loot whore" and flirted with everyone
would be much more likely to play a sexy female wood elf and have a
name like "Blowyou" or something.

(no offense to male dwarves of course, they ARE rather handsome in a
rugged way).
