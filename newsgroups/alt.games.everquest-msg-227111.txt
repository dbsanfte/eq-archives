And just hwere are you or people like you when I need a ML? ):

I've only doen that the one time, and that's cause I thought (guessed, 
more like) that taking the 168 and change to 170pp would come out perfect 
(I just did the math, and it would have been even).  The only glitch, and 
I freely admit it, was that I screwed up and did the /split before the 
last person was in zone.  That's also the only reason I noticed it didn't 
break the last 2pp into 5 gold each.  Everyone else seemed pleased with 
the result, so it worked out.

(Oh, let me add this, as I forgot to in my original post:  I only *LOST* 
about 1.5 to 2pp..the coin I added to make it a nice even number.  And, 
since I am more interested in xp at this point (beyond getting enough 
money to buy my next circle of spells),  I feel I came out ahead.  2pp is 
CHEAP if you consider it as a payment for helping me level up.  Besides, 
it was fun.)

I'd love to be decked out with 6 or 7 100% weight-reducing bags.  (Don't 
know what % yours are, just 100% would be NICE.)  In fact, if that were 
the case I'd ML every time.  If for no other reason, I can gate out, 
sell, and meet the group before most of them make it back to our meeting 
place.

Several people have mentioned this, and I never even considered it 
possible before (no reason to, actually).  I'm gonna have to write it 
down and keep the sticky close to hand when playing.

I must say "Thanks all" to those who have posted in answer to my 
question.  Maybe I'll be ML again and get it right (lol)!
