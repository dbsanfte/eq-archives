Crystal grinder isnt' bad either and should be able to be found for
under 300 now.  By your teens or even at 10, you will definitely want to
find some magic weapons.  In the Everfrost area Iced bone skeletons
require magic to hit.  Ghouls, willowisps and a horde of other mobs
require magic weapons to hit them.

Pickpocketing should work on virtually any humanoid mob.  My barb rogue
used to go visit the goblin camp between bandl and the three guard
spawn, along the tundra.  You don't need to be fighting, in fact the
skill won't work if you are.  You do have a chance of aggroing them if
you are caught, but they generally don't hit too hard anyways, and i am
sure most if not all of them are green to you now at 10.  
just keep trying it will go up, doesn't have to be blue or higher like
with melee skills.  You cannot however pick the pocket of anyone 40
levels higher than you.

IE if it's red, chances are you will fail, and it may decide to smear
you across the ground.  You can also do it against mobs as you run
past.  I did alot of mammoth pulling when i was in Everfrost, and i
would pick pocket the orcs as i ran past on my way to find another
mammoth.  You can get some strange things off mobs however, like you can
pick a gnoll scalp off of the pups.  Dvinn's heart in crushbone, etc....
