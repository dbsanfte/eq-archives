So, it seems from my reading that at some point, my currently 40th level
Druid will "need" to go to Thurgadin.

I never seem to know "why," he'll need good faction there, why he'll someday
"want" to go.

Can someone answer?

Otherwise, I stand around the Eastern Wastes, wanting to kill Coldain, not
knowing why I must preserve faction with them.
