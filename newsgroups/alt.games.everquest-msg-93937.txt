Excuse me?  Political polls influence the outcome?  Then why do BOTH sides 
generally come to the same conclusion?  They may spin it differently, but 
the numbers match up about 99.5% of the time.  Name a single instance in 
which a major poll was more than the margin of error off the results?  
(Obviously the poll must have been taken shortly before the election.)

Remember, shiny side out.
