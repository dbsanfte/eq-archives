Look at it from the companies perspective.  Taxes take up 30% of it's
income, as opposed to 10%.  It's also taking in 30% less money (your price
reductions), so it must pay it's employees 30% less (or hire 30% fewer).
Ok, so now we have people paying higher taxes, with a lower income, so
they're not as well off.  We've got companies who have balanced their
reduced income with their reduced manpower, but they still have higher
taxes, so they're not as well off.
