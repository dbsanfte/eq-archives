For my low-level chanter, I started out with:
65 HP / 65 Mana neck
65 HP / 65 Mana ring (from Fungus Grove)
65 HP / 6 AC ring

and then addded whatever items my necro had outgrown. This will put me
in good stead through about level 20 or so, at which point, I will
make a more concentrated effort to get INT/CHA gear on him.

Until level 20 or so, even INT casters are best served by HP twinks.
