How?  Both will still have their *strengths*, paladins will still have spells -
pacify, heal, buffs, rez, etc., and shadowknights will still have feign death,
lifetap, locate corpse, - all that stuff that sets them apart from warriors.

What about rangers then?  We have some *awesome* buffs, healing, snare, sow,
but we still have to LFG at times too.  Shouldn't rangers get better armor so
that they can be awesome tanks too instead of being the target of endless *dead
ranger / mana sucker* jokes?  
IMHO, a warrior is supposed to be the *best* straight out tank class.  There's
a reason he doesn't get spells, because that's not his *job*.  Nor is it a
pally / sk / ranger job to be the *main tank* if there's a warrior in the
group.
