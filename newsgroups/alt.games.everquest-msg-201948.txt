On the advise of someone here, I headed to the Kodiak caves in Greater
Divide, fought my way through until I met with a named kodiak. It
conned green to my 31 mage, so I sic'ed my pet on it, and the fight
commenced. I noticed with my 55 cleric that healed the pet after about
5 minutes that the kodiak was still at 98% hitpoints, so I had her
nuke him with her 640 damage nuke. He dropped 2% with that. I was
dumbfounded.

How can a mob that cons GREEN to a level 31 only have 2% chipped off
on a 640 nuke?! Isn't that completely insane? I eventually just gave
up, invis'ed, and left.
