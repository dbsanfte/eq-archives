    Funny, when I come from EC I have /ooc turned off because I wanted to be
able to see the auctions, not because of some desire for privacy. When I
come from Guk, I have /ooc turned off because I don't want my brain to bleed
reading all the moronic stuff in Oasis. Nothing in there about "I vant to be
alone!" Do you suppose other casters might be like that? You'll never know
unless you send a /tell.
