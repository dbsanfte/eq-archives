>> What happened to Eq? I never saw this much begging going on. <<

Wait about another month. From what I can tell, most (if not all) beggars
are little kids, and school is out right now, so they nothing to do but play
EQ 24/7.

In mid-August/Early Sep, school starts again. Begging should calm down.
Hopefully.
