And they will use any and all "ammo" they can.  The police do not pull you
over to wish you a nice day, they pull you over to bust your ass on
something they think you did wrong, and once they have got you stopped they
will stick you with as many other things as they can find.

Before someone gets all mad, let me explain that I'm not calling the police
cruel.  Being a reasonably intelligent human being, I'm also not calling
them anything but "officer" (They really hate that "Sniff sniff, I smell
bacon!" stuff =) ).  Some cops are mean, but that's beside the point.  They
are simply <i> doing their job </i> by checking you out thoroughly and
getting all possible infractions.
