Sorry, should have mentioned: I'm an SK, which means that, while I can solo,
it's not the best exp wise at these levels.

: You don't mention your class but here's what I recall from when I was at
: 48 with my druid:
:
: 1) DL -- Ragers gave exp and were easy kiting down the south side of KC
: 2) Skyfire -- At 48 you will need a group to do much
: 3) Emerald Jungle -- Some great hunting here. Lousy loot though
: 4) Burning Woods -- Excellent hunting here
: 5) City of Mist -- Need to bring a group
: 6) Lower Guk -- Nightmare of farmers, but can find exp
: 7) Sol B -- Can be a real pain
: 8) Great Divide -- Excellent hunting up to 56 if doing giants
: 9) Velks Lab -- With a group you can do entrance
: 10) Eastern Wastes -- Not sure when this tops out at. May get exp at 48
: 11) Wakening Land & Cobalt Scar -- Can probably do if you have a group
:
: Out of all these, Great Divide and Burning Woods were my favorite zones
: to crank out exp. I discovered the value of Emerald Jungle while waiting
: for a group outside of City of Mist.
