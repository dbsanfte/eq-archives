HELPPPPPPPP.......I purchased a COMPAQ presario 4000 to play EQ ..First i
could not even get to first window..Had to download DIRECT  X......Then i
would get to window that scans for new files..It would freeze there..I had to
erase Norton virus protection and turn off windows firewall perminetly..Now i
get  to play the game   BUT ..I get   DISCONNECTED  in 3 minutes ,,,during
the 3 minutes of game time..The lag is so bad i cant even move...Its a toatal
nightmare  ..I payed Big bucks for this laptop ..I have  2 Pcs running EQ
fine...This laptop is a HP  (compaq) pentium M  1.60ghz  248mb ram..Graphic
intel(R) 915gm/gms910gml.  what ever that means to anyone..Anyway now i have
everything disabled from norton to windows firewall..I am using the wireless
mode that came with the laptop..The wireless router i am using is NetGear.I
can accsess the internet outside my house and inside PERFECTLY no disruptions
at all with Internet connectivity.But let me try and play EQ  and  POOF
MAJOR problems..I have had the Laptop 1 week now and have never been able to
MOVE my 70 Beastlord one foot so far..It either frezzes up or it goes black
