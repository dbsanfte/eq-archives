Sure it is.  Why wouldn't it be?  It's something, a distinctive item, that
the makers have EQ have created, and you certainly can't claim it doesn't
have value on its own.  Otherwise we wouldn't even be having this
discussion.

Yes, it is, if they so choose.  It's called misappropriation, which is part
of the bundle of rights that constitutes an intellecual property right over
something that's been created.

That's because the word "copyright" is misleading.  It doesn't simply refer
to the right to copy.  There are rights that govern the holder's ability to
determine how their creations are used.

Except they wouldn't be enforcing the EULA.  It wouldn't be a contractual
issue, it's one of intellectual property.  They use the EULA to notify their
customers of this particular prohibition, just like slapping a copyright
notice on the inside cover of a book.  It doesn't grant them additional
rights.  It's just an assertion of the rights they had. They wouldn't be
suing someone under the EULA, they'd be suing someone for violating their IP
rights, the EULA only helps because the defendant can't claim that they
weren't aware of this specific prohibition.

Again, why isn't it?  Because it's plentiful?  Because platinum pieces don't
have a specific name?  There's a code on EQ's servers that signifies a
platinum piece, and that had to be created by someone.  Why wouldn't that be
IP any less than say, a short sword of the ykesha, or any other part of the
code that constitutes Everquest, something you acknowledged was IP?  If you
break up the code that is EQ, when does it stop being IP?
