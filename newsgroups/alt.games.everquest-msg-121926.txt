No, doesn't do much for the name hovering over the character's head
while he's standing in front of you not getting the clue that you're
not hearing him begging for phat lewtz. Doesn't change the fact that
the name is one of the highest violations of the naming policy. Guy
needs a smack upside the head from a GM, that simple. If you disagree,
don't bother.
