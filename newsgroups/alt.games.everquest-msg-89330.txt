As to what is where on a hard drive .  Where did I get reporting rites to
Verant/SOE? All I see is the give you the rite to upload gamefile
information for updating.  IE some ini/cfg type of file that keeps track of
whats been downloaded.  This does not give them a rite to list out my
directery since its neither /sony or everquest I run everquest from.
