Ok!  Somewhat ran out of _mid price gear_ to give my Shammy and
looking for opinions.  By mid price I mean that Ornate and Farwater
are out of the question. ;)

Waaaaay too lazy to do Shammy epic (and don't agree with bugging
people for twinks anyway) so that's out.  Did borrow a Pile Driver for
a little bit but that's the only main hand that springs to mind as
better than what I have.  Witchdoctor's Cudgel doesn't appeal and I
currently have a couple of other weapons rotting in bags (Loyalist
spear for looks, Mace from Cazic for max HPs) but keep coming back to
the 'Stripper.  Would prefer to keep a 1HB/Pierce weapon for looks
rather than a book/2HB etc.

Raid gear very unlikely at this point.  Would only take anything where
absolutely no one else would use (eg: Vindi BP perhaps.)

Too lazy to do faction so Thurgadin etc not an option.

Don't like ponies or Drogmor.  Mobility at all times is a priority for
me.  Might buy a dirt cheap Drogmor at some point just to avoid sit
aggro with slows but not until I run out of 10k-range upgrades.  Plus
spells are starting to hurt the wallet, heh.

Sta pretty much maxed self buffed so looking for pure HPs if possible
rather than Sta.

Regen not an issue as spell and innate regen are working just fine.  

Iksar so no JBB!

Improved Range not an issue as I have the crappy free bracer from
Karnor if really needed.

Ring of Thunderous Spirits is a possible upgrade I was considering.
Not that enthused by it to be honest.  No AC just seems... wrong
somehow.
