I think The Nameless is one of the most nationally diverse servers.
It's got a very large Asian population, and also a large European
population, *and* a pretty big Aussie/New Zealand bunch.

Rumor has it that the large Asian population came about due to a translation
error.  The instructions on starting the game for the first time were
supposed to say something like "Choose the name of your server".  That got
translated to "Choose the nameless server" somehow...and a zillion (it
seems) Asians ended up on The Nameless.  (Presumably, there's no Chinese
characters for the names of EQ gods, and so the server names were in
English, even in the Taiwan manual, so these people were just looking for
the string "the nameless" on the server screen, and found it).

I don't know if that is true or not.  Another factor that led to many Asians
choosing The Nameless was a group of Taiwanese players, in late 1999,
started trying to convince Sony to put a server in Taiwan.  They figured
they'd have a better chance if there was a big Taiwanese guild.  They seemed
to be pretty well organized, and a lot of Taiwanese players came to The
Nameless and joined that guild.

So the Japanese players say "no english"?  Interesting.  The Taiwan players
tend to say "no ABC".

There are a bunch of Taiwan players on The Nameless who are just ordinary
players, of course, and they are, in my experience, very nice.  It's just
the ones trying to be uber that seem to be a problem.  Of course there are
plenty of American players that are jerks, too...the Taiwanese just manage
to stand out because of the "no ABC" trick, and the fact that the powerful
Taiwan guilds on the server tend to be zerg guilds, so people make fun of
them.
