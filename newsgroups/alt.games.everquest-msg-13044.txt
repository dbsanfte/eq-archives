All of the above equate extra time spent on the sentence to
politeness. 

a_random_char00 sees what looks like a druid running towards him and
starts to formulate the sentence.

/say "Excuse me, kin of the forest, might I please trouble you for a
SoW if you have the time and mana to spare?"

a_random_char00 looks up after hitting return only to see a
druid-shaped blur on the opposite horizon, getting smaller and
smaller....

/sigh

a_random_char00 sees a barbarian, wolf in tow, running his way and
decides to try a different tactic.

/hail a_passing_shaman

a_passing_shaman00 stops, says "hail" in reply and awaits a response.

a_random_char00 grabs this golden opportunity!

/say "Excuse me, mystic of the cold frozen North, could I perhaps
trouble you for a SoW?"

a_random_char00 looks up triumphantly only to see a shaman-shaped blur
on the horizon, who had long since given up on a_random_char00's
apparent silence after his initial "hail".

/scream

a_random_char00 sees a ranger heading his way and decides to try yet
another method

/hail a_passing_ranger

a_passing_ranger stops in his tracks and replies "hail"

/say "Can u SoW me plz?"

a_random_char00 looks up to see a_passing_ranger is still there! Yes!
Finally!

a_passing_ranger says "No! I don't SoW people who are obviously too
lazy / impolite to phrase their questions using full words"

a_passing_ranger /rudes a_random_char00 before running off in the
distance.
