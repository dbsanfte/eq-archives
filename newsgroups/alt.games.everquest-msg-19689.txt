Was a Hitler on Veshaan server trying to beg buffs of me, and was
instantly denied buffs from all at WFP gate, and reported by 3 people.

Oh, and a guild member of mine called Seekingsow was forced to change
his name. I still havent figured out why they allowed him to change it
to Brokenhalo Tatteredwings.

Then i have seen have Bachk Stabbher running around.
