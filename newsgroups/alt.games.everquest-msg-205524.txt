I doubt the problem is with the Athlon, but I do suspect he has a
problem with the CPU cooling unit.  It's very common to misconnect the
CPU cooling unit.  I'd suggest starting there.  When an AMD overheats,
it will shut down.  There are shareware utilities to monitor the
temperature for the CPU and motherboard; take a look around. 

The second question I'd ask - was this XP Home a fresh installation or
an upgrade?  In my own experience, you have far fewer problems if you
format the hard drive and install raw and then reinstall your apps.
Yes, it's a pain in the butt.  However, it often results in a much
better performing system.

I have three computer down here in my office, and the one I use most
for EQ is an Athlon XP 1800+.  Runs like a champ, no problems at all.
However - I did recently install a slot fan which has brought the
temperature down several degrees.  Not a bad $15 investment.
