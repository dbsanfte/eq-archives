Yep, all dispel magic spells start from the top, which is why you want
disposable buffs first, either to click off for accepting debuffs/dots or to
suck up a hostile dispel.

Likewise, you can dispel the creatures, especially helpful in dungeons, or
to keep something from running away at SoW speed ( be sure to cast dispel
early on in the fight, so you dont end up dispelling DoTs, debuffs and
such )
