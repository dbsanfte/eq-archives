A significant chunk of my guild has been playing City of Heroes for
the past couple of weeks. The drop in number of members online at
any given time now is dramatic.

I'm pretty sure that few if any have cancelled their EQ accounts,
though. I wonder if SOE's rash of peace offerings is based less on
cancellations than on a sharp drop in people logging into EQ, which
they could justifiably interpret as cancellation risks.
