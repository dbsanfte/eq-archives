The PoP 61 to 65 spells are going on to test, according to
Lucy.

Hybrids are getting the spells that didn't fit within the
offsets:  Rangers with Starfire, Superior Healing, the
Circle spells for resists; Paladins with Heroic Bond,
Remedy, Divine Light.  Even necros get a 1000 HP heal and
a 70% pet haste spell.

Wizards with a 2700 HP nuke and a really nice sounding
spell that limits nuke damage to a couple of wizard spells
but increases damage by those spells by 30%.

Bards with new mez spells, a melee 60% haste with 18 ATK
and plus 15 DS, and a 15 point debuffer.

A new mage/shaman malo line spell that debuffs by 70.

New Avatar line with STR/DEX/AGI/ATK increases of *140.*
(Sheesh, my cleric would be maxxed with that in normal
gear.)  And a shaman dot for 200 when cast and 320 for
7 ticks.

Oh, and the druid "CHeal?"  Changed to 58 and renamed
Tunare's Renewal.  And add a 20 per tick, 21 tick
HoT as well at 61.

All in all, some pretty nice stuff, IMO.  And I didn't
mention the upgrade to KEI (shorter (40 minutes)  but
bigger mana boost and more mana/tick) or SKs with the
small coffin summon corpse...
