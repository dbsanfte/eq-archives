That was actually in response to Brian Hance's comments to me. No it is 
not being done (or at least shouldn't be) on behalf of the world. THAT 
is my point. When was the US voted (elected, gained by coup, etc) the 
"world cop"? You seemed to indicate that this has more of an impact 
because it was in America. Well yes and no. It has more of an impact in 
this group possibly because most of the group is American. (No facts 
here just a suspicion).

You also seemed to state that because it happened in America maybe that 
it is deserved. Yes I agree with you that we ignore most other attacks 
in other countries. But my point is we SHOULD ignore them. And we SHOULD 
NOT meddle in other countries affairs. And no one SHOULD attack us for 
other governments actions. However, if they DO decide to attack we have 
every right to be outraged. Wouldn't you if it were YOUR country. I've 
heard many people in the UK being outraged about IRA bombings. I work 
with a Canadian who is outraged about the bombings and attacks in 
Quebec. I've heard plenty of Isrealis screaming about the Palestinians 
attacking them. And vice-versa. Are you saying we have no right to be 
angered? I believe they are just as angry.. whether or not the media 
reports it.

I have not always agreed with my country's leadership. I've thought them 
sometimes to be reckless and WAY overstepping their bounds. However, we 
have done NOTHING to deserve this kind of attack. Alluding to the notion 
that it's more important because it happened here.. well you're right.. 
in the eyes of an American YES!! Just as if you would be upset (and 
rightfully so) if it happened in your country.
