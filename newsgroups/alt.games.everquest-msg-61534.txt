Run? Who the hell has time to run when the Brownies are after them? I
was recently wandering Lesser Faydark with my Paladin who was level 4 at
the time, just exploring a bit. I took the first path to the west which
apparently leads to more brownies. It was starting to get dark and there
was NO WAY I wanted to be in there after dark so I turned back. As I'm
walking BOOOM something hits me from out of nowhere. I slowly turned to
see a Brownie scout on the path behind me, right before I died. Took me
forever and a number of corpses to get my body back because it seemed
that Brownie was just hanging out. It even cost the life of a 50+
character that I recruited to cover my back while I looted my body.
Needless to say, I don't go there anymore and old Bronzeleaf is just
going to have to wait for his ghast hearts.

It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
