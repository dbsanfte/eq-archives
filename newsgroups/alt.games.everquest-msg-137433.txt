The proper amount to donate for a bind varies wildly dependant
on your class, the class of the porter, the location you are porting
from, the location you are porting to, the number of passengers,
whether the porter had to travel to get to you in the first place,
whether the porter was advertising as a taxi or whether you
contacted him, and heck, the price of tea in china.

For garden variety ports, where you are both low level and he's
advertising port from one druid ring (wizard spire) to another,
10pp is adequate.  I'd never go under that unless you are very
low level and obviously untwinked.

High end, where you and porter are both high level and the
port is from and /or to somewhere hard to reach, I wouldn't go
any higher than 100pp.

As for the bind, thats an entirely seperate transaction, now
(unless you are getting bind at GFay spires from your porting
wizard) the porter has to travel on foot and away from the
traditional "taxi stand" and its customers.  Most people offer
5 or 10pp for this, but now that there are soulbinders in
the game, many porters aren't really going to be interested
in doing it at all.

As a cleric, I generally don't pay porters near my level
anything at all.  At the same time, those same porters
often come get me and port me to their dead bodies
for a rez, no charge.  Much lower level porters, though,
I pay cash.

Enchanters will also almost always ride for free, handing
out whatever their best clarity is to the porter more than
makes up for the mana spent porting them, as a rule.

A druid will often port lowbie druids for free, and I assume
a wizard will often port lowbie wizards for free.  Don't
expect that, offer the money, but I found it got turned down
a lot when my druid was young.
