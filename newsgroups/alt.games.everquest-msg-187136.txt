A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. The Maginot Line was in
response to the Franco-Prussian war. It was already in place before
World War I. The Germans did an end run around it through Belgium IN
WORLD WAR I. However, to the Gallic mind, this didn't make it a bad
defense. So confident were they that the Germans wouldn't try the same
thing twice that they didn't bother to keep any forces in reserve,
preferring to keep them ALL on the Maginot line (slight artistic
license here.)

The Germans, having missed the bit where it was explained that there
would be no reusing old offensive strategies in this war proceeded to
once again go through Belgium and were in cafe enjoying coffee and
croissants before the French knew what hit them.

Europe only responded to Hitler once it became apparent that he would
not be satisfied gobbling up Czecheslovokia and Poland and that
appeasement was not going to bring peace with Germany. They were
saving their own asses.
