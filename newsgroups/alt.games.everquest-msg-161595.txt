Sure, but not at the expense of keeping things sieved and KEI up, slowed (dont
ask), etc.

It does, yes, but it still costs mana. Buffing time I dont mind, not having
the mana to handle combat situations, I do.

I dont know of any ranger who has yet reached the +ATK item cap without it,
but I suppose guilds like FoH would be the test cases.

Well now ,that all depends on your perspective. But given risk/reward, and that
the offhand with 40% haste and atk can be effectively single grouped I'd have
a hard time classifying it as 'useless'. It seems pretty insanely useful for
the work required.
