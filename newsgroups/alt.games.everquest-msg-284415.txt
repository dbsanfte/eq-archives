If you're not having fun it's time to change what you're doing.  It's
too bad you can't find a group.  If you consider moving servers, even
though the economy is still dorked as the rest, come on over to
Seventh.  We hooked up on the Maelin server when you attempted to
bring back the glory days, was fun.

In any case, the progression servers may be mostly hard core players
plunging through the night to raid that next mob.  Or they could be
just like you and want to re-capture the days of yesteryear when life
was hard but the money was scarce.

We still have fun on Seventh but then we're not trying to hook up with
anyone outside our own guild/group.
