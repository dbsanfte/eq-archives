I realise that maybe 5% of people in pickup groups have a damn clue about
agro management, and healing efficiency.

Also, if you have a MT in an exp group, why do you need another?  (and im
talking making good pickup groups, not grouping with friends)

If I have a warrior as MA, I don't need another class with tank abilities
(ala SK) I need a damage machine (which an SK, warrior and paladin aren't)
which is why rogues, monks and rangers would head my list.

If I have an SK in my group, then again I have no need for a warrior.

If im playing with friends, well I couldn't care less what people are.. I've
had 3 clerics in my group before heh
