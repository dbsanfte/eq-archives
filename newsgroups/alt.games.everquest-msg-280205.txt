That seems to be an awfully slight distinction when you've authorized 
them to charge that amount in the first place.

Most people don't see it as that big a deal. As I said, you authorized 
them to deduct $14.95/mo. That's $29.90 for the past two. When all is 
said and done, that's all you will have paid.

This all really just sounds like opportunistic picking of nits.

As with most unnecessarily vehement flame-ups regarding SoE policy, I'm 
quite certain the bark will be vicious while the bark all but non-
existant.

As I've said, it wasn't the brightest course of action on SoE's part, 
but let's not make it out to be more than it really is.
