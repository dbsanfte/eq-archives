As Sean pointed out, Paladin lull-pulling has a glass ceiling (it is
almost, but not quite as bad as he paints it, only about 1/4 to 1/3
of the mobs in an LDoN 60 normal are L56).  As for "darn good fighter"
tho, forget it.  Only Clerics have poorer DPS than Paladins.  The
problem with Paladins is that while their "utility" has been found
to be notaqbly useful by quite a numberof raiding guilds, it's just
flat out valueless when you're LFG.  XP groups deliberately seek out
safe places to grind, they plan to _not_ have any panic situations.
For pickup XP groups, the only role a Paladin is suited for is as the
group tank.  Make Warriors flat out superior as tanks (as they were
during Kunark) and Paladins don't get groups.

The trick SOE needs to pull off, since there's no way in hell they're
gonna reinvent EQ at this late date (all of the trouble stems from the
single-tank model of group combat, which relies not only on what the
PLs can do, but equally on the design of the zones and encounters), is
to somehow make all three tanking classes roughly equal in attraction
to groups.  A Knight nerf won't work, because Rangers are better XP
group tanks than Warriors for a lot of content right now (ain't that
right Foxeye?) so long as you have a good main healer.  They need to
bring Warriors up.

Of course, my theory is that it doesn't matter much anyway.  The recent
inflation binge that seems to have hit every server suggests to me that
EQ is gonna die a sad, mudflation and RL$$ driven heat death in the not
too distant future.  It'll stagger on, zombie-like, possibly for years
after its become nothing more than a bloated psuedo-Diablo.  But I don't
feel a whole lot of optimism about the game anymore.  And no, you don't
want my stuff, it's probably only worth about a buck-ninety-eight on
playerauctions now anyway.
