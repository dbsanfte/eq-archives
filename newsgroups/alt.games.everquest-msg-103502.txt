I fail to see how this responds in any meaningful way to Dan's post,
which simply quoted some material from Verant that is relevant to the
discussion.  If you've got a bitch about what the OP had to say you
just might want to reply to the OP's post instead.  Of course, if you
didn't top post you might be better able to see where to aim that
rusty old flamethrower.
