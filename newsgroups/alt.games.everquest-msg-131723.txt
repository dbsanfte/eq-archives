 > Put Lammy in primary hand - it's a VERY decent primary hander at your
level.

What about when I get into the 50s?  Would the lammy still be effective?
Also, I still have another Centi Longsword.  Use the Centi Longsword in the
offhand and lammy in primary?

>Buy a decent offhander, based purely on dam/dly ratio

What would you recommend for in the offhand?
