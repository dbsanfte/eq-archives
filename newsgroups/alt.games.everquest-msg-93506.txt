 Ok, I will correct the post. Maybe not all and for me to say that is a bit
sexist for which I am not. But when you spend half your night having a guild
leader cry about the guild breaking up, worried that the members don't like
her, and pissed off that another Female member is going to take all the
higher level guys to a new guild,  That kinda sums up the "Average" Female
if ya ask me.
 I mean, who gets on EQ to pick up girls? Its a game, not the singles
connection. I play probably because I am married, and one girl is more then
enough for anyone. She watched Lifetime, I play EQ. And Fighter Ace, and
DOAC, and Rogue Spear, and Unreal, ....... Kinda get the picture ?
 If I wanted too see women cry, I'd watch Steel Magnolias with my wife.

 The analysis sticks, just extracting the "All Women" from it.
