Here's interesting information that I just read on the Crucial website:

"If three PC2700 modules are used, the system will only run at 266MHz."

Guess I couldn't get 3GB of PC2700 and have the performance gains. I would 
only be able to have a maximum of 2GB if I wanted DDR333 RAM. The question 
is would 2GB of PC2700 outperform 3GB of PC2100? It'd most likely be 
cheaper to get the PC2100. I'll ask this question in the hardware 
newsgroup...
