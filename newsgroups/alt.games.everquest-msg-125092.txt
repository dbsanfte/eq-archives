Nope. Read carefully. The GM, for once, did *not* use the patented
"working as intended" line. He specifically said "working as
IMPLEMENTED" (my emphasis).  And after informing them that it wasn't
going to be considered an exploit, as you note, he also mentioned that
they could expect the situation to be changed in the very near future.
Everyone took that as a sort of "make hay while the sun shines, kids,
because the cheese wagon will be leaving town soon" sort of comment.

The fact that the decision was later made to permakill the vendor, (a
choice I predicted myself the first day I heard about this recipie
sellback rate) in my opinion has absolutely zero to do with the GM's
decision to not take any action against players acting as "server cop"
as you call it. (nice phrase, by the way) I don't even know where that
vendor (and allegedly another in Fungus grove) was located, since I
never made any cheese. (Simply too addicted to quadding Ulthorks at the
time to be bothered going and sitting and doing tradeskills no matter
how good the money.)  But I did get to hear about it first hand for days
in guild chat, and then see the floods of posts on the server boards and
various guild boards.

It was a crock of shit, plain and simple.

Nope. Missed it. Sorry.

But anyway, the player in question put that issue to rest with a post to
the server boards. I'm too lazy to go dig it up verbatim, but
paraphrased from memory, it effectively said,

***
I did it. And I'll take the heat for it if anybody wants to bitch. I saw
a situation where noobs were making tons of plat at absolutely zero risk
reward and I took action to change it. I worked for everything I have
and you can too. When you see something you don't like, you change it.
If you can't you leave. I changed it.
***

So take that for what you will. Issue is over as far as I'm concerned,
but I do know that this one player now has slightly more "limited"
options if he finds himself looking for a port/rez/trade/etc.  Of
course, in a guild like that it's not a huge issue given the number of
porters/rezzers/gear they have and whatnot. So in the end it may have no
impact except to give some small satisfaction to the people caught on
the other end of a grief player.
