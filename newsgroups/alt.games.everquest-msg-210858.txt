My first character was a human warrior.  He made the mistake of
hunting outside the Freeport gates at night.  After walking ten
steps past the gates, he was completely blind, and lost.  An orc
pawn made short work of him.

My second character was a wood elf druid.  He wandered Kelethin
for quite a while looking for the druid guild in order to hand in
his note.

Imagine my elation when I found the druid guild!

Imagine my horror as I targeted the guild master and started to
type "Hail".  You can guess what the 'a' did...
