hmm....

450dmg? now how much use exactly is that at level 54?

particularly when you take into account BL fizzle rate and mob
resists, better save your mana for pet heals.

Just remind me, how much dmg would a Wizard nuke do at this level?

I know Ice comet does 1100dmg at 49, so I guess they do around 3 times
as much by 54.
