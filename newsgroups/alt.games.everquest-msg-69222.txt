They are -not- still all red to level 11, they range from blue to red.
They
also aren't all that bad, the trouble is those pesky rhinobeetles with
their high aggro range and their Backstab ability.

Unfortunately, the hopper tails get you no upgrade, just a box so
you can go to Paladul and get a glowing stone off a rare pop mob
named Glowing something.  Reccomended level for that one
is 15+ apparantly, and I have no idea what the finished product
is at that point other than an upgrade to the cloak(since you put
cloak and stone in the box...

Llyran
12 Beastlord, Morel Thule
two levels of getting most of my exp off Moors... and dying a lot in
the process
