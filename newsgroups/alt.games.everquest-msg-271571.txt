You are seriously exagerating here for the low levels.  I soloed (mostly) 
my warrior to level 32, so I do have some idea what I am talking about in 
regards to the levels he is intending to go through.  Wearing a mix of 
banded and crafted armor, no haste item (until level 30), no buffs, I 
found plenty of places I could solo my warrior, including dungeons.  
Paludal was not around when I did the lowest levels, and that is amazing 
for soloing.  Runneyeye is generally empty, and is good soloing, sure, 
sometimes you have to run away, but, it's still fun.

I was wondering the same...
