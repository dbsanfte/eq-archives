That is your choice to think so. But most of my friends are Doctors and
Lawyers. The Doctors realize the threat in vivid clarity. Fema/hazmat is
horribly behind the times. We are already infiltrated. The odds of an attack
of this type are no longer improbable, they are probable. As we attack
terrorism, which we will, the odds of these events occuring will be
garaunteed. Our borders are a joke. We have no real defense other than hope.
The new civiliation born, if people like you win out on the attitude of the
threat, will have wished they listened to people like me. Just as the
government is wishing they had listened prior to the 11th. It's time to be
cautious in a reasonable way, not foolhardy.
