Then they aren't learning much, and should be assessed for learning 
disabilities. A zone's popularity is directly porportional to the 
*benefit* in going there.

Granted difficulty getting there weighs against in the sum of the 
benefit of being there.

Yep. Especially if theres a 5 star hotel accross the street too, with 
precisely the same amenities. If SOE wants people to move around they 
just need to give them a compelling reason... they don't have to make it 
easier.

Better loot, better cash, unique useful items would all work just as well.

And left deserted other zones people used to take the trouble to go. 
There are few busy zones at each level range because there will always 
be a 'best xp per hour' place. ZEMs just change which zone is hot, they 
don't encourage anybody to see more than one.

If they want to get people moving around they need to implement a 
variety of things (and make the numbers transparent)... examples include 
dynamic ZEMs so that the longer a zone is devoid of life the higher the 
ZEM gets ... and the more people in it the faster it drops. (and let 
people know what the ZEM is...)

Quests like giving the 25th level character a task to kill 20 20-28th 
level Mob X in random zone Y... with the reward being substantial... 
like 400pp. Why not... I can farm spider silks for that kind of cash 
that fast or faster... and this is a lot more fun, and will result in my 
heading to a place I would have no reason to go otherwise. But only 
offer 1 of these quests for each level.

I dunno... those need fine tuning... but the point is *incent* people to 
  explore... don't just set up a new pig sty for them to wallow in, and 
then set up a path of least resistance (pok books) so they tumble into it.

God forbid I explore the world, no fun in that... just teleport me to 
the mobs please. I need my phat XPs nonstop. Screw that...just teleport 
the mobs to me... I hate zoning and clicking on books... figuring out a 
new zone takes 30 minutes... and I get 0xps doin it... forget that 
noise. Line em up here on this stage in the PoK and I'll knock em down 
one after another until I gots more AAs and PPs than anybody...
