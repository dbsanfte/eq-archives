Hi

As I have a couple of Gnomes. The Karg Warriors are usually in the 
Valley out from the Windmill. While the valley of the Minotaur Mines 
usually has a mix of Elders and Warriors.

While the chicks are usually everywhere that the level 1 to 5 NPC's are 
found

As for place holders I usually find that the Krag's are around when the 
Clockworks are less numerous. But seem to cycle with the Large yellow 
Spiders as well.

Unless there is a lot of low level Gnomes in the area there is a good 
chance of finding a beak on a Vendor in the Windmills as the merchants 
there are in the right place to buy them :)

Or on the other hand Aviak beaks come off any medium to high level Aviak 
so those in Southern Karana or Lake Rathe are also promising spots as 
long as your magician friend can survive long enough

Good Luck and Goof Hunting
