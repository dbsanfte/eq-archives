I'm the same way, as are most EQ friends I've played with for a 
substantial length of time, and when someone I know goes LD I can 
usually reassure the group "I've played with X many times, he doesn't go 
LD on a whim" or something like that... or in some cases "Y is a great 
guy but his connection sucks sometimes, he may very well not be able to 
get back on till morning in sweden when his ISP people come back to the 
office"...

But in LDoN, there's an awful horrible reason to join a group and then 
go LD.  See, if they succede, you get LDoN points.  If they fail, you 
get a fail on your tally... which doesn't affect your character, as I 
know very very few people who pay any attention to the leaderboard these 
days.

So, join a group, go "LD", and log in an alt and play for an hour and a 
half, or log for the night for that matter.  In the morning, see if you 
have collected more free LDoN points for no risk or effort on your part!

Thus, when someone I don't know joins an LDoN, then goes LD after we 
have our mission and are headed in, or worse Are in, I tend to get 
suspicious.

If they do it a second time, and I've still never actually seen them 
complete one, I assume its deliberate and put em on the Never Group With 
This Nut Case list (sadly, actually the ignore list, I wish I could have 
several different lists like this so I could more easily remember why 
each person is there... my memory being similar to that of Dori)

Splendid
