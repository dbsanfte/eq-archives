Maybe you should switch servers. I used to play on ARo before I quit
last time. Could _NEVER_ and I mean _NEVER_ get a group with my
Rnager, even in the teens.

The people on the old servers are really set in their ways. They won't
take anyone that does not fit into their mold of this magical "perfect
group". Almost everone was an Alt on that server at those levels and
they carried their pregiduses with them even back to the lowbie
levels.

Now I'm on FVie, and I play in groups that routinely have 2 Pallys in
them, no chanters, no clerics, and 3 Shamans. The perfect group does
not seem to exist here. (There are about 4 times as many Pallys as
there are warriors.)

If we're going to do a Hard LDoN or a Dungeon with lots of Adds, we
will probably hold out for a Chanter, Necro, or Higher level Bard for
croud control, at least one "Tank" (Pally, SK, or Warrior) and a
cleric if possible, but I'm main healer in my groups more often than
not. (and I actually like it)

The only time someone is not snapped up immidietly when they go LFG is
when we're full, or we already have 4 clerics, we don't need another
one... (I mean after all who will the clerics heal if we have no
dedicated melee. Me I guess, after I canni.) (As a matter of fact last
night it was 2 Clerics, 1 Berzerker, and Me (Shammy) finishing out a
normal LDoN. The clerics meleed evey mob, and healed each other and
the Zerker, and me if they had the mana, and I nuked and debuffed the
hell out of the mobs.)

Last week we were kiling IG's outside Perma with a Necro, 2 Wizzys, Me
(Shamman), and a Rogue as Tank. We did pretty well, not as fast as if
we had a real Tank and a real Healer, but we didn't die. (The mobs
were DB, Even, or Yellow to me, and everyone else in the group was 4
to 6 levels below me.)

My experience may have something to do with the time that I play
(Usually around 1am to 4am Eastern) or something might drastically
change in 10 levels, but it dosen't seem like it.

When I'm playing during the week, there is maybe 3 or 4 people looking
for group at once, and they usually tell you that they already have an
offer for group if you don't send them a tell immidietly. When I go
LFG, I usually get 4 to 6 tells within 10 minutes, usually to be the
group healer. It's been pretty consistant like this since level 20.
(Because before level 20 I didn't really use the LFG command. I soloed
'till 16th in two days.) If you try to hold out for Croud Control
(Bard, Chanter, or Necro), a True tank (Warrior, Pally, or SK), and a
real Healer (read Cleric), even if you don't care about the other
slots in the group, it takes about 45 minutes to find everyone for an
LDoN. If you don't care who you pick up, just fill up all 6 spots,
then it takes about 15 to 20 minutes during avarage times. (Plus time
time it takes for everyone to travel to the spot.)

I play a 44th (in 2 more kills) Level Shaman on the server (Ceod look
me up), and can tell you, as long as you don't put something picky in
the LFG window (like "No LDoN", "Only Guk LDoN", "Karnors Only", or
"AoE Group Only") you will do just fine. (If you put something picky
in there like I sometimes do: "NRo LDoN Only, I need points for
Spell." it roughly quadruples the time it takes to get a group.)

Also if you are good at your job (like a mezzing machine of a Chanter
or a sucessfull lul puller of a Pally) people will look you up even if
you aren't LFG. I get about 6 tells a day when I'm AFK in the Bazaar
while at work, from people who I've grouped with before or from
guildies. They usually still have a spot open too, when I get home. =)

I guess to sum it all up, switch servers. Because FVie is a RP server,
it keeps getting new players and old players from other servers that
decide to try it out. I can't say from experience, but the other
special servers migh have a simelar environment.
