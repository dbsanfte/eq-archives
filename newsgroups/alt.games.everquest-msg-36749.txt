Who said I'm a number cruncher?  It's just really, 
really hard to keep up with the dozen different items 
you have to watch (and don't even get me STARTED on 
tradeskills - I only want to spend so much time farming 
spiderling silks, and by the time I'm ready to go back 
and try again, I've usually completely forgotten where I 
am) until I found Pasketti's log parser I didn't know 
where I was with what skill unless I stopped *every* 
time I got a skill increase and wrote the stupid number 
that the game GAVE YOU ANYWAY down on a piece of paper.

Then I got Pasketti's log parser and realized just *how* 
far behind some of my casting skills were on my shaman.  
A week of boring casting sessions later...
