The rats & bugs & skells at the city gates were the only thing you could 
kill. Where were you planning on going? By level 3 or so, you could have 
easily had a small box or two, and maybe a spit or backpack for larger 
items.

I always just either focussed on one type of mob to maximize stacking, 
or grouped and had each person loot a differnt mob type. We'd easily get 
a few gold each between trips to town. Rusty weapons were a gold all by 
themselves... and if we managed a cracked staff... jackpot :D

I was hit by the 'erudin' raft was out of sync with the boat issue. That 
doubled the amount of time to cross.

As far ending up in the ocean after zoning that seemed to affect specfic 
people again and again... slow zoners in particular.

It wasn't bad at higher levels, but in the kunark/velious era getting a 
bind in Qeynos or anywhere on Odus was brutal. I remember playing with 
some freinds, and we'd decided to do Kerra Isle off Tox, so we took the 
boat from Qeynos where we were bound, and arrived at the perpetual ghost 
town of erudin. We waited around for a long while for a binder, and 
never got one. (We weren't high enough to bind ourselves.)

You see it wasn't the *trip* that we objected to. It was the lack of 
soulbinders, particularly around 10th level... high enough to get to low 
level out of the way places, but not high enough to bind.

Same with my SK sceario. If he could have bound himself by Kaesora it 
would have been a no brainer, but he couldn't, and usually the players 
in FoB couldn't either due to level. So I had to make the group wait 
indefinately, or come out to me which they were often reluctant to do if 
they had the ability to fight without me. And given the amount of 
downtime in the game at that point I don't really blame them.

I think most of us had faith they would -fix- it. an LLS was easy to 
come by, and a GLS only slightly harder. And even a firebeetle eye was 
theoretically enough to light your way through dark tunnels.

Its just that they didn't actually work.
