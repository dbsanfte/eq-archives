Oh c'mon DT.  Does Aegolism consume another Peridot each tick
that it's up?  or each time the person buffed gets hit?  They
had to do something to mitigate arrow consumption or high-end
arrows are so absurdly expensive to use that they might as well
not even exist.  I was just arguing with Dennis over whether
they should <never> be used up.  That comparison with Clerics
is just silly, you could easily spend more on arrows than a Cleric
does on gems just using the cheapo arrows that my warrior makes
himself for pulling.
