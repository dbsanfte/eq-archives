  I've posted a couple of times recently. Until this past few weeks, I
hadn't played EQ since Thanksgiving. Anyway, that isn't important, what is
important, is that there are a LOT of new trade skill recipes out there that
I didn't know about. I was looking up some equipement on Alakazam (sp?), and
I came across "Crystalline Silk Sleeves." It said it was common and able to
get at level 1. So, I did a big search for crystalline, and 'ta da,' there
were a whole bunch of them. A whole new group of tailorable items. I tried
to look it up on the trade skill section, and it didn't even mention it. My
question is, where is the BEST place to look up recipes for the trade
skills? I know there are many things that I have missed over the past few
months concerning trade skills. I really need to catch up.
