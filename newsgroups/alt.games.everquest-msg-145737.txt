You write far too intelligently to mean that as a serious question, so
I'll assume you're either joking or just being obstinate. In solo or
small group situations, particulary where it's just casters, necros are
already grossly overpowered compared to wizards. The lack of DOT
stackability is the issue here. *BEFORE*, they couldn't stack them,
while wizards have always been able to stack DD nukes. (Leaving quadding
out of this.) The only thing stopping necros from ganing up and ruling
the world was the lack of stackability. Now that's no longer a
hindrance. That was the only point to that. You've always had the
ability for a group of wizards to run around together laying out huge
damage, but you didn't see it because they would tend to die a lot. The
only reason you didnt' see Necro's doing it is because they didn't
stack. Now they do.
