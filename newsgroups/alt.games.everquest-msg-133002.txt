Society was able to make do for quite a while before public education became
public-nanny.

What happens when they start teaching conflicting information, or teaching
elementary school children about the joys of gay sex?  Not just tolerence of
homosexuals, but about the act itself?  Or what about when they start
teaching that daddy's a fascist and a killer in the making, because he keeps
a gun in the house?  Or that the fact that he's a man makes him an automatic
rapist?  Where does the "education" end?

From what I've gathered from you in our discussions, I'm sure you would
agree with the statement "The more the government does for people, the less
they're capable of doing for themselves."  That applies to parenting, as
well.
