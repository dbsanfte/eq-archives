The rest has been answered, so I will address a pet peeve:
This is USENET, not a freaking board. No one is going to remove you,
no one moderates the group if it don't say moderated.  Learn the
difference between a message board and USENET, or go away. You are
operating on false assumptions that are going to make you look like an
idiot, and likely piss others off.
