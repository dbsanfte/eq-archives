A trusting soul lent me her drum for a second yesterday, so I was
a mounted mage for the duration of our DSP hopper camp.  WIth
clarity I was literally unable to use mana as fast as it was
coming in without getting aggro (at which point the mount was
helpful again).

My cleric didn't get a mount till his 60s, and while my shaman
twink had one in his 40s shaman have such a radically different
mana cycle its not even worth comparing.  Teapray loaned me her
little green friend a couple times in my late 20s early 30s, but
the difference didn't strike me as heavily as it did now at 42.

At any rate, point of this is rather than being reliant on people
so rich they can afford to trust me not to be a horse thief, I'd
like to buy my own.

What do you think the fastest way for a mage to make about 9Kpp
is at my level?

A) play as usual.  I've never had more than about 500pp, and that
just before buying my last set of spells.  If this keeps up
proportionally I'll be about level 61 before having 9Kpp handy to
blow on a mount.  This fits in perfectly with my other non
twinked character, the cleric.

B) spiderling silks.  Presumably in Feerrot, although without
track its going to be annoying.

C) Animal skins.  Presumably in WC, or is there a better place
for that.  And of course get a skinning knife and enough skill to
make them all LQ except for HQ bears.

D) combine C and B above, get tailoring a trifle higher and make
leather paddings

E) Spider silks.  Presumably in EKarana

F) Hill giants.  I can solo them now, and they are exp still.  Or
I can get a partner and split the loot but probably kill more
than twice as many per hour.

G) Nektulous guards.  3pp each and every kill, but there are only
4 on the bridge plus the one more over at the Lavastorm entrance;
is there something else I can do in the zone to turn this into a
more lucrative camp?

H) Hopper cave in DSP.  I'd agreed to leave all the skins for a
tailor friend, but it looked like a potential fortune in superb
and flawless hopper hides dropped.  Are these as valuable as they
look?  I don't think I can solo the place, but could with a
partner where I was splitting the loot

I) something else

J) Level up to 44 and -then- do something else thats too hard
without my 44 pet

Opinions?
