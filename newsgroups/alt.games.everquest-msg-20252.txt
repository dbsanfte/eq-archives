Nah, not saying there's no group learning experiences before 20.  I will say
that it's less likely, though.  Most classes, enchanters included, can solo
pretty easily into the low 20s.  At that point, though, you start wanting
particular items...and want to get them for yourself.  There are VERY few
soloable blue-con critters that drop an item you might want, so you start
grouping for that reason.  Later you group because you really don't have
much choice (I am able to solo at level 52 with my enchanter, but it's slow
and annoying).

Enchanters, because of Breeze, should have no problem getting groups at
level 16.  BECAUSE enchanters are very difficult to play well (high learning
curve) you should try to group as often as possible.  BELIEVE me, there's
very little you can do to make the group WORSE OFF.   Sure, you'll screw up.
Sure, because you aren't a god yet people will die due to overpulls or bad
luck...but without you there that would have happened anyway.  Meanwhile
there'll be fewer Total Party Wipeouts...and even fewer when you have the
practice needed.

But yeah, you can solo...there are a number of strategies you can use.  I'd
just recommend you at least partner up with a healer of some sort
(preferably druid or shaman) for those times where you don't want to dungeon
crawl.  You WON'T have any problem finding a partner or two.

As for memmed spells, Clarity, Speed (if your group has REAL tanks and not
just a druid or shaman wannabes), the latest Mez are pretty much required.

Depending on if overpulls are likely, your AE mez is a good idea.  I LOVE AE
stun and keep at least 2 up at all times anywhere I'm allowed (don't use 'em
in Unrest in the house!).  Extremely low aggro, low mana cost, and saves the
healer's mana for when it's IMPORTANT...to heal and buff YOU. ;)

As weird as it is, get ready to stop memming any offensive spells.  There'll
be plenty of times you just won't have room, time or mana.  Later on when
it's very important to slow a critter down and there's no shaman in the
group (they usually take care of it) you're going to be very low on mana
(slow is expensive).
