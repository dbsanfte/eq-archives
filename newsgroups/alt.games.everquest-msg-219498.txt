What is wrong with that anyways? Why does it offend your sensibilities 
that an entire aspect of the game be enjoyable and lucrative enough to 
attract a majority of the players to explore it?

Its like its being treated by some as some sort of twisted status symbol 
that you are special because you GMed a trade in the face of the worst 
mind numbing tediousness SoE could throw at you, and God-forbid they 
change it because that will make the old GMs less "special".
