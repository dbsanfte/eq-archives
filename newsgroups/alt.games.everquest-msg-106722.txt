All the discussion of the fungi got me interested in mine again...
I'm a 60 ranger with forest stalkers and crystal chitin for most
slots. I wear, usually, CC arms and boots, FS bracers, gloves, legs,
bracer of benevolence, etc.

For my BP however I have the choice between a PSC and a Fungi Tunic.
I've passed on two FS BP's in favour of trying to get a Dark Masters
BP (I like plate, ok, sue me. I have FS boots and arms too but
they're banked cause they're not as pretty ;) )...

Anyway, some of my friends in one of the two "top dog" guilds on
my server swear by the fungi tunic as a "top end" ranger BP. Of
course, they dont main tank much but its quite a HP hit compared
to the alternatives, and no resists ,and negative dex/agi....

Any thoughts from the others out there on its use fulltime? It looks
bearable. Not as nice as the PSC, but not so hideous I wouldnt wear
it. I'd have to stomach the constant /whistles from my guildmates
though.... How about compared to the Dark Masters BP with its 15 sta
and 35ac?
