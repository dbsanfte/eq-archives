Except you don't HAVE to do the access quest to access Zek
or any other primary zone - Antonica, Commonlands, Zek,
Enchanted Lands, Rivervale, Feerott, Everfrost, and Lavastorm
(and most of the primary dungeons) are all open access, just
level-restricted.  You can get there earlier by doing an access
quest which requires grouping or simply wait until you level.
No big deal.
