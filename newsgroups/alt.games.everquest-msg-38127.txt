prime time numbers on my server innoruk have dropped from 2700 to 2200.

The value of top level most wanted class accounts has dropped from $2000 to
$500.

Of the 117 people in my guild less than 50 now play regularly .

Leadership of the major uber guilds on all servers are giving up in disgust
and leaving .
