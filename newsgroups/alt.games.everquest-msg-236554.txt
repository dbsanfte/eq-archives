GAH, ok ok... Jason's Deli can be good,  but when its bad... be ready
for a full day in the bathroom dealing with the way the food is
handled.....
a friend described it to me the best I think...  "Its like some high
school / college kid needed a job and hates their job but works their
anyways and punishes the customers for making them work." 

so take it for what its worth...  can be good... but when its bad...
you wont go back...

Muffalatta samich is me favorite..
