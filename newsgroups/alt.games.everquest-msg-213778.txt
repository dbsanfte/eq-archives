As a DOT, the necro snares are inefficient use of mana, as a snare, the fact
that they are a DOT and therefore can't be used in combination with Mez (worse,
necros are a mezzing class), makes them worse than regular snares, not better.
Yes, any snare is an improvement over none, but the druid line of snares is
better than the necro line, longer lasting, less resisted, and more flexible.

The same is true when comparing druid roots to cleric roots; the druid roots
have a damage component, but the damage ratio on it sucks so you wouldn't
deliberately use it to do damage, and the damage means the spell is resisted
more and will break mez; less useful, less flexible, and again far better than
the root that mages get, which is none at all.  (I think necros get a cleric
style root, but said cleric just because thats something I'm sure about.  And
eventually in the 60+ game druids finally get a real root, one that does no
damage so they don't have to be so careful and don't get so many resists.)
