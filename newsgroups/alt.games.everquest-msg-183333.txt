/disagree

If you want to twink, this is HALF right. Low damage is good to prolong the
fight a bit (but not to the point that you die - lol). Low delay though is a
GOOD thing - you want lots of strikes, and you'd like them as fast as
possible. Each attack is a chance at a skillup - more attacks per fight =
more chances at skilling up. Also look into getting stuff that boosts your
DEX - that's what the skillup for weapons is based on.
