Thanks everyone for the helpful advice.  I plan on creating a Froglock
Warrior on Stromm as my first character, then create a new character
to fully RP.  Right now I'm leaning toward an Erudite Wizard.

I'm having trouble finding information on the various races.  I found
the starting stats of each but I'd especially like to see some pics
comparing them.  Any good links would be appreciated.
