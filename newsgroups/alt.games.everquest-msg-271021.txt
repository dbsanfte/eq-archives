Mezzes too.  If you're with a competent 'chanter, it's just as reasonable to
assume that adds are under control as it is to assume that the shaman has
slowed or is slowing the target.  She'll tell you if there's a problem and
you need to do something, (you can also tell by the "splat" sound as she gets
pummelled)...

These macros are just irksome.

And even for this, it doesn't work well.  Too many mobs with the same name,
and just enough resists/stuns/interrupts to make a macro tied to a cast
misleading and confusing.

Just don't do it.

The only times people need to know which are mezzed is when some aren't.  It's
far better to have a hotkey to announce those as needed.  If you like cutesy
spam, this is your chance:  "Please offtank %T, it's too cranky to sleep."

It's far less annoying, and carries actual useful information.
