Very interesting, especially these quotes:

"With Luclin, unpacked, there is over 600MB of global data.
(Animations, Effects, Textures, Models, etc.) The only alternative is
to have them unpacked and loaded in from disk as new things come into
range.

"Unfortunately, every time that's been tried in other games, the
practice has been decried because of the constant, sudden, harsh
pausing that it causes. :/"

and

"Or only the currently needed globals are loaded into RAM, and every
time a new person zones in, a new NPC spawns, or a new building/object
comes into view, we unpack and stream them in from disk, causing
massive stuttering for everyone. "

I see these symptoms in SoL.  Frequent quick bursts of disk actvity
associated with "stuttering" of the screen display.  Happens
frequently when running around in KittyCitty, not too frequently in
Shadeweavers.  I have 512MB RAM and 64MB on the GeForce2 MX/400.  I
can't see a pattern, though, as the pauses can happen when nothing new
is comming into view, and the frequency of occurance is not constant. 
It comes and goes.  Doesn't seem related to how long I've been running
the application, either.  Stuttering can happen after playing 2
minutes, and it can happen after playing 8 hours.
