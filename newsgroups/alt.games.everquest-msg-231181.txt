I've decided to start upgrading my wizard's gear, and will start with the 
gloves.  Currently, I have the following:

Dusty Bloodsatined Gloves
AC 2
Manna +25
Focus Effect: Summoning Efficiency I

I want to get something better, but don't know what to go for.  I *DO* 
know I want +INT and/or +MANA, and would LIKE a Focus effect, but other 
than that, I'm not sure what.  

My wizard (Miznit) is level 37, and my gear includes stuff that has Mana 
Preservation II, Reagent Conservation II, and Extended Range II.  (and 
some +INT and +MANA stuff...newbie armor for Gnome Wizards...mostly 
pretty good).

I'm willing to wait a bit before actually upgrading the gloves, but need 
to get some ideas of what to go for.  (And what level I would need to be 
at to get anything that is obtained vi quest or mob drop).  Any ideas?
