I have ND1 atm, and playing around with Magelo it looks like it would
increase my base hp by about 135 or so to go to ND3. ND doesn't work
with buffed Sta right? Only item and base Sta. What I've been thinking
of working on was CA instead, as I've seen some parses that seem to show
a noticable improvement in getting missed. As a high elf I'm a bit hp
light, though I'm working on improving it, mostly with hp items as I
only seem to get 1.2 hp per Sta. My current unbuffed Sta is 194 and hp
are 2906, raid buffed I'm about 5250 or so. I'd like to get that to 6k
buffed but dont see it happening until I get to the elemental planes
(Currently or guild is doing vt and emp and we just downed MM last night
so RZ is now our big hurdle)

Any thoughts on CA for clerics?
