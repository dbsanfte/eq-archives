I started and played my Barbarian Warrior up to just hitting LV5 tonight
(hit 5 because of turning in polar bear skins to lady in kilt shop for
patchwork armor and a gold each). I've got a question though for the future.
I know large armor is harder to find, and when you do find it the price is
allot more. Is the AC on large compared to medium the same or does large
have higher AC for exact same item? Like is a large patchwork tunic the same
in AC as medium? Also how do prices usually compare. I know it seams you can
sell large armor for allot more than medium, but what about buying it?

Also had a bad timing experience with a typing error. Nothing happened from
it (they realized it was typing error) but was just kind of funny given the
situation. I helped 2 barbarians kill a swarm of assorted mobs (wolves,
bears, spiders, gnolls, and goblins) which had gathered into the same place
(them in the middle and neither was a warrior). Well one asked if I had any
fungus. I had a piece so I meant to ask "want it?" but got my spacing wrong
and asked the large breasted female barbarian (who didn't have very good
cover on top, still newbie, LV3) "wan tit?" Anybody else also have bad
timings for common errors like this?
