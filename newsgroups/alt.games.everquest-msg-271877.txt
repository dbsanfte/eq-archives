Being a shaman with no snare at all, I fail to see how the snare not 
landing is an issue.  SoW potions are readily available for movement 
speed, if run 3 is not yet purchased.  Just run off a ways, and recast a 
few times.  Keep your fastest casting snare up, and cast it a few times, 
they are very high agro.  Don't send in the pet until you are faily 
certain you have agro.  On the other hand, at the higher levels anyway, 
necro pets make respectable tanks anyway, so why worry about it taking a 
bit of a beating?  I've never played a necro (well, not beyond level 4 
anyway), so my perspective is certainly likely to be off somewhat...
