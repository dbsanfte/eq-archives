No, it was directed at anyone who didn't take the cost of the reagent into
consideration when looting.  Assuming a 6-person group at level 44 where
only the main tank and the enchanter want symbol, and assuming the cleric
doesn't have low CHA then the minimum cost per hour to keep them symboled is
about 26p (symbol only lasts .75 of an hour at a gem cost of 10.5p).  More
than likely the cleric will have to pay 12p which makes the per-hour cost
30p.

THIRTY PLAT PER HOUR JUST IN REAGENTS.  That's not net winnings, that's just
OVERHEAD.  FOR TWO GROUP MATES.

At level 44 it's difficult to make even half that if the cleric is just
looting 1/6 of the time.  More than likely he'd have to loot 1/2 of the time
to get the overhead back and 1/6 of the gross loot.

Lok, I have little doubt that if you had a 44 cleric you'd cast symbol on
your group mates all day long and eat the cost.  I know too many 50+ broke
clerics though.
