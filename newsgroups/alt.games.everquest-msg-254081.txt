Went and bought some new guts today, got 'em home, started swapping,
*then* found out that new CPUs and motherboards have a new power
connector that my old power supply... doesn't supply.

Back to the shop tomorrow to pick up another power supply.

By the way, do any of you, umm, overindulge by buying glowing fans, EL
cabling, internal laser lightshows and the like?  If so, do you have
power problems when you put those suckers into your machine?
