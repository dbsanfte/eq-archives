Hunting Dervish cutthroats the last few days with my level 12 druid.  We've
been at the dervish camp in the middle of the zone near the undead ruins.
On BB server we call it Derv 2 camp.   Sometimes we'll clear out the camp
and sit on the hill waiting for the repop, medding/healing up.  All of a
sudden, someone, the main tank usually, will get hit twice by a Dervish
Cutthroat for 20 or so points of damage.  The only problem is no Dervishes
in sight.  I'd just dismiss this with a laugh if it only happened once.  But
this has happened 3 times in 2 days to 2 different groups.  Anybody else
seen this?
