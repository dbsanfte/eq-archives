My favorite "gate" memory was in the OOT.  I was about a level 18 Necro and 
was going to log off, so I decided to be cute.  The plan was for me to send 
my pet after the specs, watch it die, then gate as they came for me.

/pet attack

Watch pet die and specs head for me.

Cast gate.

Watch gate collapse.  Die miserably.

First time it =ever= happened to me, but the most memorable.  Happens all 
the time, now.
