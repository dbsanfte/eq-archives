I've been wondering who I am for quite some time now, too....(LOL)...

Well met, by the way.  (em/bows).  If we're ever in South Qeynos at the same
time, I'll buy you an ale at the Lion's Mane.  That's in the old
neighborhood where Sheldomar and Arthomar grew up in.  Our uncle runs the
Bag 'n Barrel, and Lt. Arathur is an old, long time family friend of ours.
Our dad, Sir Artonsomay Bolak, was originally a paladin from Freeport, but
the Militia exiled him when we were little.  Sheldomar still remembers the
trip from Freeport to Qeynos, but Arthomar was too young to remember it.
