I always suggest this to people - find a couple of buffing classes around
your level who have some time - group with them - get buffed - get the
adventure - and then let them go on their way (degrouped).

They still get the ldon points if you succeed, you get to solo / duo
whatever in the LDoN.  Obviously, they'll need to make sure they don't mind
having a loss as well if you fail.

You have to have 3 people to get the adventure, you can zone in with as few
as you like.
