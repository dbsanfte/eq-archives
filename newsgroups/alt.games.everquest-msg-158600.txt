As an example, last night the guild got a call from someone who wanted help
on the burning priest in scarlet desert.  I was in great divide.  I thought
about pop porting to pok, nexus, selos run to echo, fungus, twilight,
scarlet.  But instead I got picked up by the druid and ported to twilight
sea.  MUCH faster even for a bard.
