Well, after waiting around in the areas that you guys told me I
finally met a some Sarnak Broodlings. They are in fact VERY rare and
hard to find. I would say I killed about 15-20 in a one hour period of
searching for them before I even had one fang. Got the second tooth
about a half hour later. I turned in the  quest items and got a
no-drop lore cap (or something), but with lousy stats, but I saved it
just in case.

Thanks for the help.
