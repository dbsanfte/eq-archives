If you're conceding this, then you don't really seem to have much of a
point.    No, he didn't list all of James' qualifications.  None the less,
the majority of us do seem to recognize him as being qualified and
experienced.

His point is meaningless.   If he isn't AC capped or closing in on it, he's
doing something wrong, and even mentioning the strength demonstrates
cluelessness from a self proclaimed expert.   The shoulders are an extremely
good item.   Of course they are not the best.  They are droppable (and in
this case twink) gear that come from a non-raid target in a relatively easy
zone.

If he had suggested a superior, yet harder to get, replacement, then he
would have had a point.   A meaningless point, but a point none the less.
Instead he named an inferior item, and suggested it was the wiser equipment
choice.
