That is one meaning of the word, but far from the only one, and certainly 
not the one that SoE is using.

As far as solo xp nerfing.  They reduced the ZEM for most PoP zones, and 
at the same time significantly increased the group xp bonuses.  In doing 
so, a soloer in a PoP zone now gets less xp, whereas a group generally 
gets the same as before, or more.
