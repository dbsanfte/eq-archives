I have one of those horrid chipboard "computer stations" (it was a gift - I
have to use it) even though I would prefer an oversize ordinary office desk.
I have a box full of zone guides on the floor to the left of my desk, and a
bar fridge on the right which is kept stock of light beer (hahn premium
light for the fellow aussies).

The "evil outside light" is stopped dead in it's tracks double layer
cardboard against the window. Of course I have been banished to the
spare/store room which looks like a disaster area, but that went without
saying....=P  I have a swag folded up against the wall for the times when
the EQ sessions would have otherwise caused my frozen "no movement for 5
hours" legs to inserted into the Sleeping Girlfriend Bearing Bed at ungodly
hours...That earned me a few bruises early on...

The rest of the house is as neat as a pin...I think....Hmmn - it <HAS> been
awhile...=P
