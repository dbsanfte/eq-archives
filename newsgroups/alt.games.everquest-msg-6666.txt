Warrior.

Yes, there are quite a few warriors out there, but by and
large demand outstrips supply by a large amount.  SK,
paladins, and rangers are -not- the optimal choice for
main tank, every group should have a warrior if they can
get one.

As late as last year, I'd have said Cleric for much the
same reason... Every group should (optimally) have
a cleric as main healer, and demand outstripped
supply substantially.

Now there seem to be sufficient clerics and a relative
lack of warriors... good news for the hybrids, of course,
as its raised their demand level, except that hybrids are
generally better suited to secondary tank roles; the
fact that they get thrust into damage sponge duty isn't
-really- to their best interest either!
