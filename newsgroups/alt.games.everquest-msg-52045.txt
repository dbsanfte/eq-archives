Correct on these two.

Horse crap on these.
Haste is not useful since practically every meleer at a level that can
get the epic should have dragon level haste or better.  And some of
the best haste items in the game are armors.

Monk epic is only useful as a decent ratio weapon--a weapon which
quickly becomes not so great compare to other items in game which are
about the same level of difficulty in obtaining.

>cleric and chanter epics only real usefull for raids .

At level 60, there's very little else to do and level 60 comes VERY
quickly these days.
