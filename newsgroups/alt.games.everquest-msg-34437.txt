On Saturday a player sent me a tell in EC asking how he, a lowly lvl 1 DE,
Solusek Ro worshipping Wizard could gain the trust of the Freeport Militia.

I told him to kill many, many Orcs and perhaps when he was older to kill the
beasties in HighPass and turn in the ears/scalps.

He was a fantastic RP'er and bid farewell saying 'Curse my vile Dark Elf
brethren for the deeds that make us unwelcome wherever we travel' [edit].

Anyway, when playing an evil Char you can be evil or be perceived as evil
until you prove otherwise. Most Evil chars I know fall into the latter
category.
