Indeed, that sounds like a great option. I went out tonight and bought a
copy of EQ Gold for my wife, she will be joining me in the game soon. We
were considering reviving one of her old accounts that has a level 21 WE
Druid that could easily join my Shaman on E'ci, but a more interesting
thought might be to start new characters together on Firiona Vie. Thanks for
the info.
