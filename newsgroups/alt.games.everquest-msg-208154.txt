As my kids would say, Doi.  Like I dont' know that.  I said that 
sacrificing 1 hp for 1 wis Might be a mistake, and that certainly 
sacrificing one HP for one mana would be a mistake, thus demonstrating 
that I knew there was a difference and further that I understood that a 
wis was worth more than a mana.

6 mana for one HP... I'm not certain thats a good trade for a shaman, 
thats what I'm saying.  I know its hard to believe, but I really feel HP 
is that big a deal for the class.

If it helps to bolster my case, I've put not one point into wis in 
creating my shaman, nor have I selected wis over HP for any single item 
in any slot on him.  Yes, I do have some wis gear and some mana gear, 
but every bit of it was selected either for its focus effects or for it 
being the best deal I could find in terms of HP gear within my budget.

Ask me how often in 51 levels I went OOM and wished I'd had a bigger pool.

I'll help by suggesting its fewer than the number of thumbs I have on my 
two hands.

Pool is a minor consideration, at least so far.. maybe in the next 14 
levels I'll finally reach a point where I'll wish I had more mana in the 
pool.. but given that bigger and better canni spells are coming up, its 
going to be hard to convince me that sacrificing HP to get it makes sense.
