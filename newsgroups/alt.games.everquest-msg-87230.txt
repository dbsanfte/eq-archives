 I wouldn't consider anyone who uses walls to block AE as exploiting,
unless it was to fight a mob that couldn't fight back. If using walls
was an exploit just about every guild that has done ToV (we don't bother
with walls in VP) would have been banned by now. It's simply good
tactics. It's not like the mob can't go around the corner after you if
he gets mad enough.


 Some GMs.. To put it plainly.. Are idiots. We once had one threating
us, saying we were exploiting because we were pulling Dain down the
well.
