I am on Fennin as well - I would not pay 50pp for KEI. I have paid the usual
10pp since the patch that I have always paid - on some occassions I have
paid 15pp if they are not busy.

No-one has refused to KEI me. Enc have made enough money (exploiting a bug)
as it is and should not be so greedy. Enchanter greed seems to have inspired
druids and such like to enforce prices on ports and SoW's. Are we going
start charging for people to join groups as well soon?
