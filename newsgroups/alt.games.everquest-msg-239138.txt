Congrats on Swifty.  As a fellow ranger who does not have Earthcaller,
let me tell you it's not that necessary.  Get a Swarmcaller if you
want a slow (but you'll need another haste item).  What I used to do
(around 59-61) was solo in Velks.  I'd get a dex buff (focus of some
sort)...and solo the spiders.  Pull with Immolate, stick another 2-3
dots on it (doing 160 odd damage/tick) and hack away with Swarmy until
it proc'd, then swap out Swarmy for Swifty and my Lammy.  I had a
haste belt from PoAir (ok was only 16% but better then nothing).
