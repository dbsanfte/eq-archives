I would recmmend that his first bag be a Large soiled.  The monk needs a lot of
bandages and shurikens and these and food can weigh a few pounds.  I'd got for
that first and pay no more than 1K.  Hanging around SolB will get ya some
bargains on them too like 500 PP if one drops for a higher level that already
has one..they are lore.

After that bag, the tink.
