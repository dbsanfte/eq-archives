So, let's see here...
If they go live with something instead of trying it out on Test first
people go ballistic because it's untested.  OTOH, if they try something
out on Test first people go ballistic based on initial reports.  So,
whether a change is tested publicly or not, people will go off the deep
end, often before there's any solid information available and always
before SOE has had time to evaluate and possibly test modifications.

To be just a bit more fair...
If they actually did what you report there I agree that strong reactions
are very much in order, especially via /feedback on test and also thru
the Dev Corner feedback mechanism on eqlive.  It's never a good idea to
throw out the baby with the bath water, so go right ahead and yell at
the idiot holding the basin at the window if that's about to happen.  As
to your specific example of AE groups in Old Sebilis, I think that might
be a pretty good threshold test, if their changes make those attractive
then they'd best consider whther the changes have gone too far (and if
the answer is no, then be prepared to deal with some serious CS fallout
if they don't simultaneously somehow make AE groups not work anymore).
