Unfortunately a great deal of people have a tendency to be obnoxious
assholes. This tendency gets even more pronounced when they are placed
behind the relative anonymity and physical safety of a computer terminal.

I have no issue with PvP itself - it's just these assholes I dislike. I am
not saying you get more assholes on PvP servers either, it is just that on
the blue servers they gain no form of control over me at all. I can just
totally ignore them...literally, which is of course the thing that assholes
hate the most...
