So?  If 20k is more than the max damage that someone is supposed to take who
falls there with safe fall, then it is a bug.  That does happen on occasion.
E.g., I saw a friend fall down a trap in LGuk, and take 10k.  The fall was
his fault for not being careful, but the 10k was way more than the fall was
supposed to give, and so he could have got a GM res if he'd wanted to wait
for on (he was a Cleric with 96% res, so we didn't bother asking).

The interesting question is what happens if the max damage there is supposed
to be something less than 20k, but more than his HP, so that he would have
dies anyway.  Res for hitting bug or not?
