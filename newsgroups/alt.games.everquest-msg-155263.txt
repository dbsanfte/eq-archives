My wizzie main solos about 50% of the time, duos about 50% of the time.
These numbers are very approximate, and leave about 1% of my total hunting
time during which I am in a group of 3 or more.  These percentages consider
only hunting time; I am not counting my tradeskilling, questing, exploring,
vernding, or raiding time in the above percentages.  If I considered total
play time, I solo an even higher percentage of the time.

Oddly, this contrasts with my Necro alt, who has so far bucked the trend and
has grouped probably 75% or more of his hunting time.
