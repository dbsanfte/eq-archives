Sigh... I wish you were wrong.

Bugs aren't the problem (can you imagine EQ surviving the release of
Velious and Luclin if they were?!) The problem is that SOE has slashed
the customer support budget, and made it very clear that we're there
to consume product, not demand any kind of services for our money.
Petitions going unanswered for days, total lack of GM events since
Legends came out (does Legends still have GM events?), cookie-cutter
expansions like LDON and LoY, etc.

It's just sad.

But I continue to play to be with my friends. Move them over to EQ2 or
chase them away to WoW, and I'll just go get my life back....
