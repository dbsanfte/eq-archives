    Hi, has anyone else been getting this?? I live in Atlantic Canada, and
was able to get on to Torvonnilous for awhile last night, but the pings were
horrible. Usually upwards of 20K or more and then just get disconnected.
Figured it'd be cleared up by this morning.
    But by this morning I can't seem to get logged into the game server at
all. I didnt change anything on the PC. And things have worked good since
last December when I got it. Just curious at this point if I'm alone..
Thanks
