Are you kidding me? Soloing was HARD at first, it's a BREEZE now and the 
last few years since the Bazaar was instituted. You can twink out a 
character with godly gear that makes it easy has hell to level.

When EQ first came out we were in Bronze armor well into our 30s and we 
were badasses to have it, because that was even hard to come by. Now, 
you get armor that is better than that by the time your level 10 even if 
you aren't twinked.
