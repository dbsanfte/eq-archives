Well, there are those dev rooms in each zone that people occasionally
get stranded in. Maybe, if there were a way to intentionally get in
there, one of the GM's could summon people into those rooms (with no
exits) and keep them from disrupting others. It wouldn't keep down the
shouts or OOC's, or keep people from gating out, but it might actually
send a message if all of a sudden you see, "You have been summoned by
the Gods!" and then you find yourself in a room with no exits, with a
bunch of other miscreants. =) Heh...could be fun...
