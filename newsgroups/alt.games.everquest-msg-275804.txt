Here's how it works..
Higher levels do give better regen, but it is still capped by your
level.
If you are level 31,, and drink a level 30 drink.. it will regen at
level 30. Drink cap
if you are level 31 and drink a level 40 drink.. it will regetn at
level 31 .Your level cap.
if you are level 31 and drink a level 20 drink.. it will regen at level
20 . again drink cap.
As it works out.. your best benefit is to start drinkin level 40 when
you are about level 33-34 to show any real improvement..
The levels of drink are base 10 - just so you dont have 50 different
drinks you gotta search through.
