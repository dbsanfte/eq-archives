Aerial combat is not in initial release I believe.

Space combat will be an add on after initial release.  The twitchers and 
skillers on the dev board at the SWG site, have already drawn up sides on 
what that module should be.

From the last I read on the developer's board for the SWG site people have 
already turned their nose up to the game because not everyone can be a 
Jedi.

Of course this followed the crowd that left when it came out that Storm 
Troopers will only be NPC's.

Which in turn followed the crowd that left when they learned droids 
couldn't be a playable race.

Last I read the boards(about 6 months ago) extensively, the PvP players and 
the PvE players had squared off concerning the faction system in the game.

I plan on playing.  If it isn't all the above, it will be an interesting 
crash.
