You're "dancing" here dude, plain and simple. In *every* reference to
"all-inclusive", you *automatically* add a default disclaimer of "may
encounter certain amount of problem getting adopted" etc. You're a phoney.
Should be "all-for-one, one-for-all", and "no exceptions". Loaded otherwise.

Yup, you are not "equally" concerned with others. Thowing table scrap's
at the other side in attempts of "equality" is flat-out Lame dude!  If
that makes me too dence to contune discusion with, fine, so be it, might
as well end it right here. Besides, I'm not throwing personal insuations
at you, am I?  Maybe I was, who knows.

> So suprise me, please.

Ok, here it is:  "I rest my case".  If you feel that you've been as "equal"
in your beliefs/efforts/actions as you possibility could be, and I maintain
that you have not, then we have no further discussion left to deal with.
