I've been paying EQ for nearly a year now, and ran into this for the first
time tonight.  Wanted to ask the group about it to get some advice:

My level 25 Bard was in Highkeep tonight looking for a group.  I found a
group in the Warrior Room and they invited me in.  The group consisted of 1
Shammy, 1 Warrior, 1 Enchanter and me.  Right off the bat we started killing
Goblins.  The Warrior and myself tanked and the other two buffed, debuffed,
etc.  Every time a Goblin went down, the Warrior looted it the second it hit
the ground.  I noticed auto-split was turned off.  The next couple of kills,
same thing.  He would loot a kill the second it hit the ground, even if we
were still fighting other mobs.  After 5 or 6 kills, I asked nicely if I
could please have a loot every now and then.  Nobody said anything.  In
fact, nobody spoke during the entire grouping.  No communication whatsoever
except for the occasional "pop".   Anyway, the next 3 Goblins slowly popped,
and the Warrior once again jumped on the corpses and took the loot.  I told
the group, "I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to go.  I need to be in a group
that shares loot".  I disbanned and left.  The Shammy sent me a tell and
said that the Warrior was "power-looting" and that I shouldn't get upset.
"Power-looting? I don't even know what that means.  And why didn't you
bother to tell me when you invited me?", I asked.  "And why didn't you tell
me when I started asking if I could have a loot every now and then?", I
asked.

Ok, like I said I've been playing EQ for nearly a year and have played in
many groups over the past year, but I've never heard of "power-looting".
Can somebody help me out here and explain the concept to me?

Thanks,

Liat
25th Bard
