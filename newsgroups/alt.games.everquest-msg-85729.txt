In addition to the above replies, theres also a "firepot room" in the SW
corner of TD, which has teleports to All the starting cities, except qeynos
and the vah shir city. Makes for an easy way for an iksar to get back to
kunark, or for an easy way to get from FV to antonica. Such a shame you cant
bind there. just watch out for the 100 point damage fall when you swim in.
