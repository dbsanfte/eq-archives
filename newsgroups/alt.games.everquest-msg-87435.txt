   Indeed, us females are forever dicking up 
the game.  Too bad Verant just doesn't hire
in-game CR reps just to follow us around and
baby-sit us, and keep us from getting our
helpless selves in over our pretty little

   Too bad I don't have a dick to wave.  I'd
like to be as good as this this game as you
are, Biz.
