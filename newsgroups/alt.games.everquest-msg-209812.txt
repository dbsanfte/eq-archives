Have been doing a bit of grouping in PoI and PoD lately, they're both
somewhat more brutal than PoJ but vastly better exp if you can get a group
to work. Have finally worked out how to reliably single pull in the common
camps of both of these planes, although it does involve being willing to FD
and subsequently do the real thing if feigning fails.

Anyways, my first thought is: Are the planes designed for twinks or what?
I've got a full suit of acrylia plate on with some parts upgraded to Blood
Ember, and it isn't really enough to tank unless i'm in a group with a
cleric AND a shammy. Well, it's ok in PoI now at 56 but still sucks in PoD.
Mobs there *are* white and yellow to me in the camps I'm at, but still, I've
always thought a full group of competant people should be able to handle a
yellow or even low red mob... considering the 6:1 odds, WITHOUT having to be
twinked to hell?

Second thought: What is UP with pickup groups? Why do people play in a group
for 10 minutes then piss off without finding a replacement and stranding the
group without a healer or slower or tank or puller whatever other vital role
they played? Why do they feel this is ok behavior? 5 other people now
sitting on their butt contemplating their navels for 20 mins or more waiting
for a replacment to be found and guided to the camp... Gives me the shits.

Third thought: Why are there so many twinks out there? The number of times
I've given up MT position to a knight or warrior 5 levels below me because
they've got 1300AC and 500 more HP than I do is.... stunning. Something like
half the characters in these first level planes seem to be stupendously
twinked - cultural at LEAST. Yes I'm jealous :)

Fourth thought: I remember the horrific struggle I had to solo pieces of
decayed plate from lizards in feerott to quest my precious few slots of
Darkforge armour... and the... minor dissapointment I felt when I found out
I could buy bits of darkforge in the bazaar for (then) 50-100pp... followed
by the subsequent LESS minor dissapointment I felt when I realised how CRAP
darkforge is compared to what's available in the bazaar. I think the game
designers should have put some reliable mechanism in place that made these
lower level quests still worth doing even once the expansions came out. Or
was it a pure commercial decision? Having expansions is *compulsory* because
trying to quest old world armour is such a (comparitive) waste of your life
now?

Cheers,
James
