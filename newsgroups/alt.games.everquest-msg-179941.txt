[15] That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal
life.

[16] For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

[17] For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that
the world through him might be saved.

[18] He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is
condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
begotten Son of God.

[19] And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

[20] For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

[21] But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made
manifest, that they are wrought in God.
