If you like travelling, there is a quest to make Frostbite vomit the
fish. Go to Surefall Glade (Illusion: Human and Alliance are your
friends) and talk to Gerael Woodone. Get the nitrates from him and take
them to the zookeper in Ak'Anon, to get the regurgitonic. Don't talk to
the guy, just hand him the nitrates.

Give the Regurgitonic to Frostbite (don't forget to /hail him first, or
there is a chance he'll take the tonic and keep the fish), give him the
tonic and you'll get a severely smelly Koalindl off him.

This is a very satisfying way to get your own stein, but at the current
prices (you'll be lucky to get more than 200pp), it's only worth the
time invested if you can port around, if you plan to farm the quest.

By the way, doing this quest a few times will make you KOS with Kazon
Stormhammer, king of the dwarves. Then again, big deal.
