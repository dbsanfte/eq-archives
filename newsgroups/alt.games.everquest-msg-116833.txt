Steamfont has krags & brownies?  I don't recall ever seeing either.  ANYway,
if it cons Ready to Attack or Threatening, go ahead & kill it...there's
nothing to lose.  If it cons better than that, killing one to see what
happens to faction (if anything) shouldn't hurt.

Or you can go to www.allakhazam.com under Bestiary >> By Zone and find out
there what is & isn't safe for you to kill.
