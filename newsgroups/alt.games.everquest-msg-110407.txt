I can't remember exactly, but wasn't "the Chimp" a low 50s
necromancer you inherited? If this toon isn't level 60,
buying AA abilities is a waste of your precious time and
experience points (with the possible exception of Run Speed
under certain conditions). You will probably widen your EQ
horizons most through normal leveling.
