Forgot to finish this thought: but I'm a berserker, which means I can 
only use two handers, there's very little out there for me with a delay 
under 30, and frankly I'd sooner use ones with a delay over 40 due to 
the much larger damage bonus for a slower weapon.

A normal melee class can get two 10/20 with +2 damage augment where I'd 
be stuck with one 20/40 with the same +2 damage augment; I have fewer 
weapon slots and the one that I do have uses a much longer delay, as a 
general rule.  Basically we are looking at getting 1/4th the benefit off 
a given augment type (admittedly this assumes the other melee spent 
twice as many points)
