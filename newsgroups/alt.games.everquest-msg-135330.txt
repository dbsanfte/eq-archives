I didn't have any troubles getting the patches either. I did, however, 
download many of the components shortly after the servers came down for 
patching. Certain files were apparently already available and few people 
were attempting to log in, so I got many of the files before all the 
turmoil. I haven't had any trouble connecting to the patch server to log 
in to EQ now though.

If anyone is still having trouble getting the patch, I've put up the new 
UI files at:
http://www.thalunatik.com/uifiles.zip
That's not everything one will need for the patch, but it does get a lot 
out of the way. For those who still need those files it can also save time 
not only because the patch server might be going slow but also because all 
of the new UI files total about 12.5MB while this zip file is just 4.3MB.
