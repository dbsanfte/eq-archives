As you point out, there's lots of ways besides damage to get agro.
There simply isn't any gear in the game that's gonna allow a 35
Paladin to outdamage a 49 Monk using the weapons he mentioned, at
least not while fighting mobs that give exp to the Monk.  The
difference in weapon skill, Offense skill, Double Attack skill,
and level-based damage bonus between those characters is simply
enormous.  And if that Paladin really was taking agro from the
Monk it had to be by chain stunning and mashing Taunt every time
it refreshed.
