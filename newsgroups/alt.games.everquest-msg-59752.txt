Khleth in disguise.....most likely..a guildmate of mine on Torvonnilous
did something similar in the WFP gate area when he decided to quit EQ.

Eckles left about 100 or so corpses in thegate area in assorted race
ilusions, assorted sizes and a number of trees, carts etc that all did the
same as you describe...it was quite fun as he slowly delvelled fighting
the FP guards, and drew a GM to ask 'Why?', but its didnt half slow the
game down in the area.....which was a bit of a pain to any other player in
the FP area. I think after a few days and complaints from several players
the GMs moved the corspes.
