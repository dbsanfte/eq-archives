What nerf?  That's the way it worked.  M2H was the best 2-hander in the
game.  Remember, this was when the SSoY (8/24 proc:Ykesha at L37) was
"uber".  The best ratio on a one-hander was that Paladin 1hb that drops
in Hate.  Ghoulbane was better than any one-hander available to dual
wielding classes.  Hate and Fear armor was uber.  The very few wizards
who championed AE nukes were considered crackpots.  Hell, when Kunark
came out there was a big newsgroup controversy over whether Wizards were
useless, most higher level groups would refuse Wizards and many veteran
players were incredulous when it somebody pointed out that his group had
broken and held disco in Sebilis with not one but two Wizards in it.

Oh, and there were 2-handers better than the Combine Greatsword, BIBS is
20/47, there's a 17/45 from Befallen I can't recall the name of, and an
18/39 from Everfrost, and the SBH (16/48) from Highpass, and a 15/45
WAR only quest axe, and the LSoW is 20/41 (or 21/40 can't recall), and
the Deepwater Harpoon (actually a Halberd) is 18/40.  But you can see
how Kunark quickly obsoleted almost all of these with the common as dirt
Axe of the Iron Back (16/37) and the fairly easily obtained Runic Carver
(18/37), which have themselves become quite obsolete.

The M2H is a relic of a bygone age, one of the few that still holds a
little value (I was killing Kunark and Velious giants with mine until
I got an Arbitor's in my upper 40s).
