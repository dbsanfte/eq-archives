When I had a Regions account I deposit my paycheck(also printed on regions,
so same as depositing cash) into an otherwise empty account and immediately
go use my debit card across the street at the pawn mart (I had to sign for
it, so it used it as a credit card) and also right down the street at
walmart where I entered my pin and used it as a debit card.

When I changed jobs to one that printed on amsouth checks I got an amsouth
account, and QUICKLY noticed they did not do business the same way, it took
them up to 24 hours (from midnight of the day that I deposited)


So it all depends on who you do your banking with, dont say something *cant*
be done unless you've banked with every bank in existance and know from
experience.
