Hah!  You missed.  You could've corrected my mis-reference to "Call
Lightning" and been dead-on.  But no! you had to accuse "Lightning
Call" of being something that it is not.  :-p

The two spells are very similar.  If Lightning Call were available on
a scroll it'd be nice for a lowbie druid who was soloing.  But since
it's got that stun effect like a chanter nuke it'd be dangerous to use
if you were healing for a group (it also is listed as costing 80 mana,
compared to 70 for Careless Lightning, range and level and cast time
are identical).

Careless Lightning:
94 to 99 hp dd
*** Items:  Spell: Careless Lightning and others

Lightning Call:
110 to 122 hp dd with a 0.0 sec Stun effect
*** Items:  Sarnak Lightning Caller (NODROP 15/28 1hb)
