Hm, well, contrary to you and Prelgor, what I've always heard (but,
admittedly, not checked directly) is that item/buff/song haste all
stack.  I.e., you get your best single item haste, your best single
buff (spell) haste, and your best song haste, and they all add as
long as you don't exceed your cap.  (And then there's overhaste.)

Also, I believe the cap depends on your class as well as your level.

Clicky items are either spell or song effects, as you noted.

I suppose I too should check it out.  I don't have a log parser for
such things, but for just checking attack speed it's not that hard
to count attacks per minute.  And my monk has a clicky song haste,
so all I need is a haste potion or buff and I can run the test.  Hm,
have to find a suitable target to swing on.  (Alas, I'm still KOS in
Katta Castellum so I can't use the bankers there.)
