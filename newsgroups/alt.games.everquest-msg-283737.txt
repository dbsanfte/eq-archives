No, it was only nearly useless; I remember even with sense heading in 
automated mode, that it would take 20 levels or so before I capped sense 
heading out.  I'm talking here about low level spells, and at level 1 
you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who had capped their sense heading.

I remember navigating by rules like "clouds move east to west" and I 
remember dropping a rusty sword on the ground because they alway fall 
pointing north.  I even remember casting True North for direction, 
mapless and lost in the depths of GFay.  It wasn't a great spell by any 
means, but the degree to which it is useless is currently much higher 
than it used to be.

100, still had to work it to cap it out, but had a big head start.
