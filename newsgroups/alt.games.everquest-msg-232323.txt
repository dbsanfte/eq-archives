I agree that a rotating system is too cumbersome.  The first time the party
has to stop 5 minutes to determine who's next or has an argument about
someone looting out of turn I think a rotating system is over with.  I've
only had one pickup group refuse my offer to be ML.  I don't like to be the
looter, but I am in my regular group so I figure we'll get that out of the
way and onto killing stuff.  Since I'm almost always the looter it's
difficult for me to comment on the honesty of others, but I've had no
problems in the looting and splitting process.  Only on rare occasion has
anyone in my normal group looted an aug they shouldn't have and then it's
only been by obvious accident.  In pickup groups it's never happened,
although my pickup group experience is probably limited to 25 or so
adventures.  People have been very pleasant during the split even when
there's been tension during the run.  I announce the plat I started with,
what I have after selling, and a /split.  After that we roll on the named
gear. At 65 in LDoN normal, named loot is almost never an upgrade, so we're
just rolling for the chance to sell it.  If I did run into a "rogue" looter
or splitter, that person would be the easily avoidable exception to the rule
that most players are laid-back and honest.
