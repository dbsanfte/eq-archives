Ahhh. I will try that. I don't know why I didn't think of trying various 
combinations. I tried Kill and Stealing, I also tried KS. (KS got, rather 
surprisingly, no hits.) Trying killstealing honestly never entered my 
mind.

Ahhh. That would be why I probably don't read that board. I hear enough 
bitching at work, on Usenet and from my wife (although that may have 
something to do with her being pregnant). I don't feel the need to 
subject myself to more of it voluntarily.

Yeah. I am not certain that I like those wipes a whole lot. There are 
lots of times, especially when searching for info on CoV, that the 
response is:Statesman said it in a post a while back but it has been 
deleted.

You did. And no problem. Being angry and frothy is only fun when the 
person you are writing to is likely to either completely misunderstand or 
is kinda clueless in their own right. (See shadows) No fun being frothy 
with someone who is actually capable of an adult conversation.

(Mental add-on. Test your mental age/maturity on the last paragraph and 
see how long it takes you to sink down to my level)
