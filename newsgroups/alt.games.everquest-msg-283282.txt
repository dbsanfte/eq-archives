Out DPSing a main tank isn't a difficult feat, or shouldn't be.  My 
'Zerker managed it fairly regularly, when he wasn't the main tank himself.

In fact, I could outdamage another 'Zerker,  same race and level, in 
identical gear, with identical buffs:

When you stand in front of the mob, your DPS drops; you face his dodge, 
parry, riposte, and you likely take stuns from him as well (unless 
you're an Ogre).

So if the "main tank" is holding aggro, and you're standing behind the 
mob where you should be, you really shouldn't have any trouble 
outdamaging him.

My question is, do you think my general assessment of the class is still 
right; can you function as a fairly decent "main tank" if your party is 
lacking a warrior/paladin/SK, and can you function as a not embarassing 
substitute for a "real" DPS class if you aren't the "Main tank"?

I remember, way back in the day, when a monk could do just that, taking 
damage slowly enough that you could keep him healed if he was tanking, 
and dishing out sufficient damage from behind that you weren't sorry to 
have him along if he wasn't.  Thus my definition of "medium tank"

Sadly, this flexibility doesn't tend to be prized in EQ, where you're 
generally able to field someone who is -best- at any given job you need 
filled, rather than taking someone who's not as good but can do some 
other job instead (also not as well as the specialist)
