You've mentioned elsewhere that you're a wood elf druid. Which means you
likely spend a lot of time in Greater Faydark. One of the things you can
forage there is Morning Dew. I sold mine in the Bazaar for 30pp each, which
was enough to buy my first few levels of spells.

Crushbone belts and shoulderpads drop off the orcs in Greater Faydark and
Crushbone. You can often sell these to players for 1pp (belts) or 2pp
(shoulderpads). Or, not as directly lucrative, but perhaps better, a dwarf
named Canloe in the Kaladim Warrior Guild is looking for said belts and
pads. If you turn them in to him, you get good xp, good dwarf faction, and
small patchwork leather armor, which you can sell or wear at your option.
