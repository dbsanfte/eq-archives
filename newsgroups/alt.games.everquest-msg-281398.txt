Think of shrouds instead in the manners of Race and Class.

You have the Gargoyle Race(from the /claim) which has all it's classes
available right from the start of claiming.

There are also(I know I won't remember them all) the following races:

Undead
Humanoid
Reptile
etc...

You start each of these Races with one full Class available.

Take reptile race for instance.  You have full access to the first
class(Bezerker) in the reptile race and start off with 1% earned
towards getting the next class available for that race.  Any xp you
gain in the first class will earn towards increasing the shroud
progression to the next available class in that race(along with xp,
aaxp, leadership xp...etc) for your main.

You can play any of the races on the first tier of classes up to the
level of that character(rounded down to the nearest 5...ie you're char
is 42, you can make up to a level 40 monster to play).
