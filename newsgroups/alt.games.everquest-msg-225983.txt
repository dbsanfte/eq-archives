    Once you hit level 65, there's a lot of difference between a full raid
gear level 65 with hundreds of AA's and a 65 with minimal AA's in Bazaar
gear. The dungeons don't differentiate between the two. So the people with
better gear/AA's have an easier time. Also, you can Charm certain mobs in
the dungeon to get a real DPS boost. For example, when we do Hard level 65
adventures we can usually find a mob to charm that doubles for over 900
damage. He easily outdamages the entire rest of the party, especially if you
have the courage to haste him. With a charmed mob in the group, my CH won't
land on the main tank before the mob is dead if I start casting at 50% mob
health. So you're talking about 20-30 second kills.
