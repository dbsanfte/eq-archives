That's actually my next project, as I just got one of the old dualethernet 
RSP PCI cards that Dialogic used to make.

That with a switch on one side and the other ethernet card going to the LAN 
will allow me to use it as my DHCP server and firewall/IDS system (with 
snort and logging, etc). Then I can put my LAN behind a high security zone 
and make my linux box into a bastion host with some port forwarding, etc.

Sweet! I may have to do that, I think I still have a copy of MS-DOS 6.22 
beta lying around somewhere :)
