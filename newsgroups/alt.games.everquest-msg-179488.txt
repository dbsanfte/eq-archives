They're already hunting the frog guards in Gukta on CT.

Was taking the nickel tour of the place (like what the frogs have done with
it) when a group walks in and starts pulling.  There were a couple of
halflings (a warrior and a rogue) with 'em ... I hope they realize that
froggies are a good race.

On a funnier note, there was a lvl 58 troll SK in there, invised, looking
around.  Out of the blue comes:

<TrollSK> shouts "Dis tickin me off."

Best laugh I've had all week.
