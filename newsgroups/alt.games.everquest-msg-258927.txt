And I do that, when I have to, or just want to. The Patrician III manual
that ships with the US version stinks; it's incomplete, B&W and printed on
skimpy, thin paper using type that is impossible for me to read. The
included PDF file produces an 8.5 by 11, full-color, complete manual. I took
it down to Kinko's and had it nicely bound and it's a pleasure now to work
with it. But the game cost me twice as much that way. I'm not willing to do
that for many games.
