Ok, this is a really nasty event.  We manage to trigger the ring just find
and get the horde of stunnable mezzable bugs locked down.  Gank the
first big blue spider that splits and then the suckage begins.  We never
fail to lose 2-3 of our tanks and 2-3 of our clerics on when that critter
splits into 3.  Sometimes this leads to a total wipe other times it's just
a partial wipe via some fervent kiting.  Is there some clever trick to
managing the splitting spiders?
