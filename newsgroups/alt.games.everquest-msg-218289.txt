I have a paladin (23) and have read bits and pieces about tanking
ability and damage caps of the various tank classes.  Here are the
questions keeping in mind I don't expect to get past the 40's:

How many more HP's would a warrior have v. paladin?

Would warrior AC be innately better or is that strictly gear based?

Damage output of both given equivalent weapons and str?

Aggro management of warrior v. paladin? (no spells-more dmg v.
spells-less dmg)

Overall value to group?  (not raid)

I am pretty casual and play with the same group every week.  I don't
expect to be uber, I don't even expect to get to 50+ given the amount
of time I play.  I understand that given my play style the answer is
usually "Play what you enjoy".  I enjoy both and just want to find out
which one is better suited to a single, consistant group (with no
healer except a shaman).

Thanks.
