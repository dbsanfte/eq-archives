I never bought LoE, mainly because I'm not a big RTS fan. That said, I 
found the concept of the game's characters all acting in concert using EQ-
like tactics intriguing (AI enchanters mezzing a portion of your forces, 
shaman slowing the rest, etc.). I felt that if anything, that may have been 
enough reason to try it some day.

Was this really the way it ended up working? How was it worse than other 
RTS titles out there today? What made it such a steaming pile?
