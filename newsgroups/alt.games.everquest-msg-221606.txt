When my cleric was coming up through the low-to-mid-50s, *everybody*
in that range was in PoN, PoD, or PoJ. Of the three, PoN seemed to be
the least popular and the only one with real potential for cash drops.
Even if I'd taken all the cash drops, I would have come out 100-200
plat down after a good day of XPing.

I managed to put together exactly one OS and one Chardok group between
50 and 55. As it stood, it cost me about 3500 plat to go through those
levels, not because groups were stingy, just because there were no
plat drops where everyone was hunting.

I was lucky that I had a 65 rogue that I could play in Bastion of
Thunder whenever cash got low. I don't know how clerics in that range
who didn't have higher-level alts made it through short of taking a
day off from grouping every few days to go solo greens and rebuild the
coffers.
