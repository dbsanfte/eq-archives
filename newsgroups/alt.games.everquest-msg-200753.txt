Well, I have heard differently on the xp rate for necros vs quad kiters.  
Bards however, can xp faster soloing.  Just takes a skilled bard, and a 
good connection.  The thing that finally convinced me of how awesome a bard 
can be was watching a level 61 bard swarm kiting summonning mobs in PoN 
over in the Hedge area.  There were probably 12 to 15 of us just standing 
there watching him.  Brought our xping to a halt as we just watched in awe.
