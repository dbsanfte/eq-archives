I *love* my barbarian shaman.  She's a lot of fun to play, and (so far, 
although I know it's still early) solos with very little trouble.  What I 
enjoy the most is the difference from the mage - my shaman can cast *and* 
tank.  So if I'm oom, I'm not automatically screwed.  I can step in and 
start beating on the mob.  In fact, I usually prefer to pull with a cast, 
then fight it to death, when I'm soloing.  Keeps my fighting skills good 
and high.  I raise my casting spells by buffing constantly when in a 
group, and handing out lots of SoWs and buffs in newbie areas.

One question I have - can slow spells be used more than once on the same 
mob?  I mean, if they're slowed once, will another slow slow them even 
more?
