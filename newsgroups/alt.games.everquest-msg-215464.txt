I play a 55 vah shir BL on Saryrn. Have enjoyed it all along, and am now in
solid demand for LDoN groups which I am enjoying a whole lot. I soloed
probably 75% of the time until LDoN came out, but never had much trouble
finding a group when I wanted to.

I picked vah shir because I knew I would be soloing a lot, and I had read
that the kitties were the best balanced beastlords. Haven't tried other
races so I can't personally compare.

If I had it to do over again I'd have put all creation points into STA
because WIS and STR items are much easier to come by -- a friend who has a
53 BST concurs with that. But a caveat: I can't yet predict how LDoN
augments and items might change that.

I twinked this char a bit but without any plan, just gave him a few
miscellaneous items that had gone disused from my 47 cleric. And a passing
BST gave me a decent H2H weapon early on which did help quite a bit in the
teens.
