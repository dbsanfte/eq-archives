First, my apologies for forgetting that my newsreader does that 
automatically when it sees a colon in a title. I've tried to remember to 
watch for this, but some slip through. A better convention for subject 
prefixes might be to use brackets [EQ2] rather than a colon. I know that 
another solution would be for me to use another newsreader and I've tried 
every one that has been recommended to me but I found them all lacking. 
Until something better for me comes along, I'll continue to use this one and 
will try to watch for the problem. But even if I were to switch, enough 
people still use my newsreader that it will continue to be a problem if the 
topic header contains a colon.

Second, there is no real EQ2 newsgroup yet and it's not clear to me if there 
ever will be one. Many of the same people I've interacted with over the 
years in EQ1 are now playing EQ2 and posting here. There's an unchartered 
EQ2 group that is not likely to get much traction, and unfortunately that 
makes it even less likely that a proper one will form up any time soon. 
Until one does, however, this really is the main newsgroup for information 
about both EverQuest I and II. From what I see of people coming into EQ2 
from EQLive (including many of the old diehards from my EQLive guild who 
swore they'd never come), I suspect that it won't be long before EQ2 becomes 
the primary topic of discussion in this forum (if it hasn't already), and 
information about EQ1 becomes the one requiring the [EQ1] header.

I'm open to suggestions for a happier resolution for everyone, and have 
raised the question myself in the past and have always tried to honor 
conventions that allow people to distinguish the two topics. But for now it 
appears that this is indeed the primary newsgroup for information about EQ2 
and it's my first stop on Usenet to read about the game.
