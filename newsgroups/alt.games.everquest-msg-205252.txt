Dangnabit, Alla doesnt' say whether Skargus summons.

Anyone?

And he quads for 150 (HT for 1k) and only has 10khp.  I've tanked mobs
with 25khp that quaded for 250 with only a shaman healer...but trick was
it couldn't summon, so I could root the mob, back up, and let the shaman
epic it to death if things got hairy. :/ If I can do that trick
here...golden.  If he summons...well...not quite so golden, but still
doable.
