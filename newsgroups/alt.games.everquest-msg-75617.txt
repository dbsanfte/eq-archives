Wife picked up sol for me, I splurged 30cdn bucks on another 128mb of ram so
I am now at 320mb, the rest of my system is:

Celeron  500
GF Mx400 64mb
playing via cable
win98se

I have clipping turned all the way up, but only play in 800x600 using 6 of
the new models in sol.  The only areas where I bog down a bit are in SoL but
by no means unplayable.  First lands and karnark work fine... I suspect it
would be an entirely different story with all models turned on and trying to
do 1024x768
