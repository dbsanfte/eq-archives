Getting the twink items took about 15 minutes.   Myself and a friend raided
the level 1 twink casters we had set up and never gotten around to playing.
Nothing special, but a nobles robe, full raw silk armor, ring of frost, all of
those other lore items that you save and never really find a use for.
Polished bone bracer, etc, etc, etc. .The druid teleported to Freeport (where
we had our twinks) got the items, and teleported back to steamfront where the
new character had just been set up.

Planning took even less time.  "Sure, lets do it" and we went and did it.
It's not like we had to research areas or anything.

And yes, the levels came much faster than a level an hour.   Throw Skin Like
Nature on the newbie, 300 extra hit points and 2 points regen.   Throw
Chloroplast on them for 12 or so more health per tick.   With low grade twink
items such as above, they're now indestructable, practicly.    All the hits on
them are regenerated back before the next can land.   Meanwhile the damage
shield is doing 24 damage per hit to anything they fight.

We spent perhaps 3 or 4 hours on powerleveling the Gnomish Inquisition the
first night.  By the end of the night, the level 1 enchanter was about 13.  As
I said, we could have went much faster if two guild members hadn't gotten on
thier newbies to catch a ride.

By the end of the second day, with about the same time input as the first, all
three newbies had went from 1, 5 and 7 to 18, 16 and 17, respectively.

So, in 8 hours /played time, (about 1/3 of Lodizal's spawn time, if you found
him uncamped :P) we took three characters right up to the last name level,
just about.

One character would have finished level 20 no problem, since the experience
wasn't being split three ways.
