Whilst I agree with your sentiment, I think this is a bad example. Even if
your pet outdamages a PC, if both are in melee range, as far as I'm aware,
the NPC will always attack the PC (excluding rooting ect.)

I've seen this where I've sicked my pet on a giant and half way through the
fight a PC's wandered by, and the giant immediately turned on the PC until
they get out of range again.

I could be wrong, or this could be different for your pet as I'm a shaman,
but I believe this was something that was changed a few months ago.
