Your recourse?  Sue them in civil court.

The TOS and the EULA are contracts.  Contracts can be written to say
anything at all, but whether or not they are actually legally binding
is another story.

I can sign a contract selling myself into slavery, but I would never
have to honor that contract since slavery is illegal.

I am fairly sure that charging for a service and then not providing
that service is illegal. It sounds like some form of fraud to me.

Therefore any contract which required you to sign off on paying for a
service which the service provider could withold at their discretion I
am pretty sure is an invalid contract.  I don't think it would hold up
in court if seriously challenged.

If they suspend the guy for being obscene and he can prove that what he
said does not fit the definition of obscenity, I'm reasonably certain
that Blizzard would be forced to refund his prorated service fees for
the duration of the suspension.  No matter what the TOS says.
