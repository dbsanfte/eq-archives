Umm... Speaking of flawed logic...

Let me assure you that yes, per capita, DC has a higher violent crime rate than
Virginia. Virginia's rate, however, is not "extremely low." And DC is not
currently the murder capital. It lost that title a few years ago. Regardless,
there are many significant differences between Virginia and DC that can affect
crime rates. They aren't clones of each other with the exception of gun laws.
Attributing a difference in crime rate between two neighboring jurisdictions to
one single factor is flawed logic.
