I agree. The posture for the females is a bit... odd.

I loved the velious armors, I miss them very much.

The boob thing is annoying. Actually, I dislike large breasts, which
puts me quite in the minority in the industrialized nations. Firmly in
the "this guy is dangerously unstable" category... sigh.

You'd think that more RPGs would have a create your own character
option as powerful as some other games. There is a tennis game on the
XBOX that you can create a character that strongly resembles just
about any real person you care to try... Breast size, head and face
shape, height, weight, etc..
