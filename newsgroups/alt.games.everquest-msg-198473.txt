	They use a lot of equipment that no one with access to the bazaar on a
mature server would even look at twice, and a lot of the choices are very
uneven across class lines.  Considering the Ranger, no one would even think of
using Split Paw Hide or a Short Sword of Morin anywhere but Stromm (and in a
month, not there either).  Rangers get a Banded cloak, other classes get
Lizardscale...WTF?  And there's the No Arrows issue.
