I already read Island of the Colorblind, so I have an idea what AAoM
might be like :)

One thing that amused/annoyed me in that book was when he wondered how
people without cones could see stars and other finer details. Heck, I
see much much worse than any achromat with my glasses off, and even
*I* can see a couple stars. It becomes a matter of noticing a blip of
light rather than noticing a defined pinpoint, and you don't need high
resolution eyes to do *that* (without glasses, stars to me look a bit
larger than the moon does when I see that with glasses).
