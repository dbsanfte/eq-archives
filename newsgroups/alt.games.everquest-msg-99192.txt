Yes, and before any of this advice is tried, let's remember that this is
a very low level characer, *AND* he's a necro. (i.e. not a mage, wizzy,
etc.)

At higher levels, fear kiting rules for necros. Mine's 26 and fear
kiting is really finally coming into it's own. In the first ten or
sixteen levels, though, Fear is nothing but a HUGE mana waste that's
normally resisted and even if you stick it, it lasts all of three
seconds. Also a big taunt. Lower level necros, well into their teens,
are far better off sicking the pet, applying the dots they can afford,
mana-wise, and jumping in when Jabober goes low to tank for them for a
bit. This also ensures that you do more than half the damage and get
full xp for your kills. Fear kiting sub-10 is just suicide.

Necro's don't get any sort of root spell until (if I'm remembering
correctly) level 16. And that one is Hungry Earth, I believe, which is
research only and ONLY works on undead. So root rotting, even with a
pet, is a very limited option for the low level necro.

Indeed. But wide open areas with few potential adds are the best for
this.

A method not suggested here is to be a bush-druid and do the reverse
kite. Set your pet to "no taunt", then snare dot-dot-tap, whatever to
keep the aggro on you. Just stay well ahead of it and be ready to
re-snare when it wears off. The mob will chase you around taking damage
from your dots while Jabober beats on it from behind. You should be
aware that when the mob is persuing you it will take a significantly
lower % of DOT damage then when it's stationary or running away, but it
still adds up. This is probably much safer at your level, since your
snares are FAR more reliabe than your Fear line and last longer with far
fewer resists.
