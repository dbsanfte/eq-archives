Uh huh...I can't tell you how many times we've had to cancel a CoM raid for
lack of a rogue; and we're going to Chardok within the next few days but
that might be cancelled as well...for the same reason.

Rogues are the only class that is ABSOLUTELY required, per Verant, for
shaman, mage, druid, ranger, cleric, enchanter and wariors to get their
epics (well, and the party doing their epic, of course <g> ).

Thanks for reminding me, though...I'm going to try to keep it fresh in my
mind to complain about that later this evening.
