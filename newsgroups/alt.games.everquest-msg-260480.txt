I have to disagree. The thing I hated the most was the complete lack
of description of the spells. I don't need D&D specifics, like "10d6
Fire Damage to a 10' radius." But a description of the effect such as
"Creates an explosive blast of fire damaging creatures in a small area
over range" is something that the vendor should be able to give you. I
know when I go to the store and see some shiny do-dad, I can ask the
sales clerk what it does. The spells didn't have even that at the
time.

I did like the hardness that used to be there, I was especially fond
of the huge death penalties and corpse recoveries. I got to be very
good at them. I really liked the sense of world. The trip from Halas
to GFay was incredible.

The only problem I had with it was the amount of time and effort you
had to put in to gain levels. The slower you level the more time I
spend examining the mechanics that run the world. Unfortunately for
EQ, the game experience (short of raiding) does not really change much
from level 10 to level 65. Your particular class may get a few new
strategies or abilities, but fundamental way that things are done
really does not change. This is true more for some classes than
others. The bottom line is that EQ's game mechanics are actually quite
plain and unimagined. I quit EQ the first time because I spent so much
time getting to level 20 that I saw how threadbare it really was. Now
that you can get to level 50 as easy as I got to level 20 before I
quit, I don't spend as much time looking closely at the quality of the
rules set that the world plays by.
