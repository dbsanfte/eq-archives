They are bad and evil and bad.

I am not joking.  Last night we had another bad incident with them.  They
heavily recruited one of our own recruits.  They need Beastlords, and have
been spamming our Beastlords with promises of phat lewt if they join.  We
gave our beastlord recruit a lot of leather Elemental drops (that would
otherwise have rotted).  Once he had them, he dumped us and moved on to CiH.

Now, that says a lot about his character, and frankly someone who does
something like that I'd rather not have in the guild anyway.  But I think it
is rather poor form to actively recruit someone that's going through the
recruiting process with another guild.  In the past they have told our
recruits to use us to get flagged for the Elemental Planes, then dump us and
join them.  And some of our recruits have done exactly that - /wave Luciya,
/wave Naniildar.

That is by far the least of their crimes.  They regularly gank mobs from
other people, not much caring about niceties like that fact that someone
else spawned the mob.  They seem to enjoy being rude to the rest of the
server and are often obnoxious to other people in /ooc.  For months they
went out of their way to try and keep us from being Elemental flagged -
fortunately we got around that.

Now, for the past few months things have been relatively peaceful, and for
one big reason: they are the sole guild in Time on Drinal.  So they don't
have to compete for spawns.  That also keeps them very self-contained - they
can be as rude as they want to anyone else on the server and it won't effect
them at all.  That, in my opinion, is a terrible attitude.

If you wanna see a prime example of CiH behavior, check this thread from the
Fires of Heaven message board:

http://makeashorterlink.com/?P2E912046

Shows a prime example of the CiH arrogance and general up-yours attitude.

I could go on and on.  And they are not all bad, of course, they do the
occasional nice thing.  But they continue to display such arrogance and such
a lousy attitude - like telling our recruits to use us to get equipment and
flags, then dump us and join them - *and* then follow that by having their
officers taunt ours about it.

...

As you can guess, I really have a strongly negative opinion about them.
They only good thing I can say about them is that they know their stuff and
are competent enough - they've taken down Quarm.  So if your only desire is
to be in the guild that has access to the most content on Drinal, Cats in
Hats is for you.  If a guild's reputation and honor are important to you,
avoid CiH like the plague.

This is strictly my opinion and doesn't necessarily reflect the opinion of
the whole server or of my guildmates.
