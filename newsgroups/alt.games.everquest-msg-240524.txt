So far I've seen a couple of nice upgrades for the non-raiding lvl 65.
We got a 48/40 (+41 atk) fabled mithral 2 hander out of Guk that was a
nice upgrade for our pally and a couple of the 9ac 75hp range slot
items from the dino in OOT that was an upgrade for half of the group
we took there to kill it. 

Rgds, Frank.
