Hey all,

I've been OOC for a bit over a year now but have recently been
thinking i might get back into eq. I was barely playing before
cancelling my account, so most of dod/don run together for me and the
expansion that came out right after those (serpent's spine?) was the
last content i saw (there are 2 more since TSS?). None of it seemed
too thrilling, but then again, the populations had just shrunk to less
than half (wow, eq2, and then vanguard) so there was a sour, empty
ambience. So i'm curious how things are now, if they've only gotten
worse (i heard all pvp servers were condensed into one), as in ...
more servers closed, less and less people playing, etc. I know sony's
throwing out content but that's honestly the last thing i care about
presently - i'd be thrilled to re-explore the old stuff and gradually
go through (w/o spoilers) the stuff that's already in the game,
provided people are still playing. And of those playing, is it mostly
people who *like* to play? Maybe even RP a bit? If eq isn't "cool"
anymore, then maybe us true nerds can have some fun - again, provided
there are enough of us.

And for the technical stuff, i imagine the FAQ that's been so
devoutedly maintained for the last few years should be my first stop -
but that's only if i decide to try out norrath again and that's only
if you all can give me some good news about the state of the game.

Last thing - if anyone here can tell me a bit about Fennin or Firiona,
i'd love it.

Faza, Enc of FR ( / Goom,  Bst of FV)
