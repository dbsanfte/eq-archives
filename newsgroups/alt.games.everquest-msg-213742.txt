The short answer is no. There are programs that break the EULA that do allow
this kind of thing, but since they break the agreement use at your own risk.
I really think they should add this, but I seldom play the group healer so I
don't miss it that much, and not enough to use macro quest or something.

One thing you can do is get a programmable keyboard and assign F1 and 1 to a
special key and do what you want with the %T built in vars etc.
