You lose AC, not damage output.

Being 1 or 2 overweight isnt so bad, but when your hugely overweight, you
can lose some massive AC.

At 60 my average weight is 22, for weight reduction I have a Tinker bag
(bought from sola 100% weight reduction), Dusty Ransackers pack (looted in
Kaesero 70& weight reduction), and a very large purse (looted from Lord
Yelinak 70% coin and item weight reduction)

If I equip my TStaff though, i am at 28 weight (30 max), thats over my limt
(24.9) and I do lose AC, but I still notice the same results as using my 2
1hb's and being under weight (the proc makes up for it)

One of the first weight loss bags I got was an evil eye bag, then one from
crystal caverns.
