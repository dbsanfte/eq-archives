actually, what everyone else is saying is incorrect.  they are all
part of the conspiracy and are trying to play this whole event down. 
what is really happening is verant has been watching a select group of
people from birth, you included, and recording every aspect of your
life.  you probably already suspected this from all the slip-ups the
agents flying black helicopters have made and times you've heard them
make noises while monitoring your *private* phone calls. i suggest
insulating your computer case with 3 inches of lead to prevent them
from intercepting signals and further invading your privacy. i'll stop
here, seeing as how this post will probably never make it to you. good
luck.
