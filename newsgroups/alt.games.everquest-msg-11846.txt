I have gotten a 14 HIE Clr and a 19 Eru Necro there safely.  The only scary
part for both was making it through the Driders (my age is showing), that is
the spider people that hang around outside of F.V.  Even invis some of them can
see you; just stick to the wall and run like hell.  Once you get through F.V.
its a pretty simple trip.  I took a Cleric from 14 to 19 in two days, and that
wasn't non-stop playing either.
