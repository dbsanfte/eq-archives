Its not insta cast, but darn cool anyway.

Blazinf Bracer of Fennin Ro Effect:Firebolt

Darn handy if you are a warrior. its a 3.5 Sec or so cast time, but a
great tool to pull with if you are out of arrows or just cant be
bothered lugging a bow around anymore.

Unfortuately it drops off Zordak Ragefire. And he is kinda rare. In
any case my Warrior has one, and uses it all the time.
