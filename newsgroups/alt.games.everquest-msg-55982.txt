And of course you still get the lie message that says servers are
temporarily
congested, try again in a few minutes.

Been a gripe of mine for years, why is there no flag they can set to say
PATCH

Or at least an ETA in the patch message itself.

Coupled with the new "UP" lie, this is twice as irritating as ever...
which
is to say not at all intolerable, just one of those nagging itches.
