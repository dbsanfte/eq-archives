This is an embarassing question to ask as a level 54 cleric, but I
never even thought to question it until a month or so ago.

When I was just wee little dorf I was told by someone (I really don't
recall who) that I should never cast buffs that increase HPs on a
freshly res'd character - always wait until res effects are gone to
get the full effect.

As I've grouped my other non-cleric chars I've noticed some clerics
follow this rule, others do not.

Preferring to avoid death to experiment, and being in tougher areas
these days where I don't wish to experiment on guildies, I thought I'd
just ask here:  Does it really matter?  Should I wait for res effects
to fade before casting my symbols and HP buffs?  Does this apply to AC
buffs as well?
