Another thing: Human females no longer have the chainmail wedgie of

That's because all the NPCs in the old cities who had a "skin" that
wasn't available to players were actually considered by the game to be
their own model. Therefore, they weren't changed when the model for
their race was changed... They'd have had to go through and change all
those NPCs individually.
