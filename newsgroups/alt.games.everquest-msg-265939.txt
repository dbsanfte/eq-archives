No, there's no way they could have fixed all the bugs. That's just a 
statistical improbability given the amount of time they had left to find 
them and then test the fixes, etc. But they did manage to get things working 
well by the end of beta so I saw no significant errors in the last couple of 
days. That doesn't mean they're not there, it just means that I didn't find 
any. I still have some of reservations about a few of the design decisions 
that were made but I'm open to seeing how they play out in retail.

and in this matter I expect the industry to be just as equally divided and 
passionate.

Hmm, I wonder if we'll have a decision by the end of Tuesday night ...
