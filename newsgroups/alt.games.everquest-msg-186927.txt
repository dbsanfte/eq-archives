Eh?  Uhm yeah. Then what?

The Yugoslav situation shoukld have been addressed many years before. But there 
is no oil there. And it was a problem that Europe itself should have addressed. 
 It also was and is an extremely complex matter, not the least of which we are 
talking about EUROPE!  Our roots. Not some benighted and exotic far away place.

Can't argue with that.  Always was, always will be.  But to what extent do 
people let him get away with it?

To equate Iraq with Germany in 1939 is ludicrous.

Slaughter is slaughter. We are about to kill tens of thousands of Iraqis. Does 
that trouble you?  Slaughtering more to make up for many already slaughtered 
doesn't seem to me to make a lot of sense.  Nobody has been slaughtered in Iraq 
in ten or twelve years, On the other hand, many have been slauughtered in 
Afghanistan, who had nothing to do with anything, and the Israelis are 
slaughtering people every week.

I worked in Kosovo with UNMIK. I saw what was done there by the Serbs and what 
the UN and NATO were doing. There are in fact just wars and unjust ones. Clinton 
did the right thing in Kosovo. The situation in Iraq is in no way comparable. No 
way.
