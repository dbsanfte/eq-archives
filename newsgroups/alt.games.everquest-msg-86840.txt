What I did- I only had the original EQ and SoL installed and registered and
then I bought the trilogy..  I totally uninstalled EQ, then reloaded it via
the trilogy.  Then installed SoL.  I then loaded it up (and patched of
course) and then in game go to "register expansions" and click on the
trilogy graphic and enter the code from the trilogy cd.  When thats done,
assuming you have registered SoL previously, then "Expansions enabled" will
then appear in white on the server screen with no more "register expansions"
button.  What you are subscribed to (i.e. SoL, kunark, etc) is saved on the
EQ servers, not on your PC, meaning your subscription info is never
forgotten as to what expansions you have.
