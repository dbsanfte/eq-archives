That has to do with Grimrot being a 200 minute spawn with PH spawning
(seemingly) well over half the time.  You could see most anything
(except maybe Ragefire, but that's another Cleric quest) spawn
half-a-dozen times while Grim is being camped.  And I haven't seen
anybody camp Grimrot for a long time, that Xx Acrylia Cloak with 10
WIS for under 2k beats the hell out of what remains one of the longest
and most frustrating camps in the game (If you're tough enough to
solo live Grimrot you can make the 2k lots faster than the camp is
likely to last).
