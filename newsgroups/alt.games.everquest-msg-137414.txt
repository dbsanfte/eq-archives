So you don't know why it has to be said?

You simply blurted it out.

Says who?   You?

Where are the rules written down for this?

So you haven't read them, and you have no idea
what they are about?

Despite this obvious drawback, you still feel
qualified to offer a critique of them?

It won't make any difference. It is imprecise,
unclear, and ugly to look at.

I may as well explain the workings of an internal
combustion engine to a tadpole, but...

Note the use of 'entirely' in your statement
above. 

All one needs to do to prove your argument false,
is to find just one example where it is not true.
That is the problem with making foolish sweeping
statements.

I take it you understand the difference between
primary and secondary sources as relates to an
historian.

Wouldn't you say history is also made up of such
primary sources as artefacts, buildings,
battlefields....etc, not just the written word.

You are confusing history with historians.

This is in regard to Gerald Gardner, not to all
history books, which you would have known had you
read the thread.

And, it actually say the opposite, doesn't it?

That I am willing to change my views if there is
reason to do so.

Sometimes you have to weigh the probabilities
between one version and another. 

Only one one version can be true though.

Anyone can make shit up and call it an
undocumented history. It usually gets the
attention it deserves.

Especially if you don't have an answer.
