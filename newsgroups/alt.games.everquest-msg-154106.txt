    Again, there's rules to nail KS'ers and a group of rogues could do the
exact same thing. Where manaburn chafed was where wizards would take down
mobs before any raid could mobilize to get the target. On the serverwide
warrior channel, one warrior was complaining that short of going to
Veeshan's Peak one had to purchase the green scale for the warrior epic from
Team Manaburn. They had Sev locked up completely. And as much as wizards
said "anyone could do this" - well, no. Not as fast, not with as little
risk.
