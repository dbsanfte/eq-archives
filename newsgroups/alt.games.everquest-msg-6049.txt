Well I finally did it!
I got sooo fed up with Trumpy Irontoes attitude and the way he goes out of
his way to pick on my friend down at the docks, that I HAD to kill him.
He was suprisingly easy to kill just a single nuke for 125 Dmg and a couple
of hits over the head with my Runed Totem staff and Trumpy was fish food.
Funny no one seems to notice he's gone either in fact my faction with the
good guys went WAY up, being a Erudite Necro this is a very good thing :-)

He was kind enough to leave me many a beer and his head.  I seem to remember
hearing about some NPC in Qeynos I think it was that really wanted poor
Trumpy's head.... Even had a bounty out on him if I'm not mistaken.
Alas I can't seem to remember who or where this guy is and no-one I've asked
seems to know.
I have looked at the most wanted list (my in character name for the quest
list @ eq.stomped.com)
And can't find anything.

Please tell me... Is our dear nemesis Trumpy as useless in death as he was
in life?  Or will his severed head bring about some sense of satisfaction
and comfort to some dear NPC (and maybe put a little plat in my pocket :-)
Sincerely
Despise 10th lvl Necro Ayonae Ro
