Why does 'God is too complex to arise naturally',
follow logically from the 'life is too complex to
arise naturally' argument?

Can you show why this should be so, or why you
believe it to be so?

Must it? 

And, even if it is, what bearing does it have on
the argument?

Isn't there a difference between coming to a
conclusion about life, which is tangible,
observable, and seemingly subject to a variety of
natural laws, and something that is none of these.

I don't disagree with any of this. 

I was disagreeing with your statement that;
"...Occam's Razor demands...". It doesn't demand
anything, it is merely a reminder of where the
best results usually are.

I don't think that simply changing the word 'life'
to 'creator' in your syllogism is valid. 

In what ways are life and a purported creator,
similar enough for the terms to be used
interchangeably in your syllogisms?

To summarise;

I see how the first premise stands up;
The creator cannot have have come about by chance,
it is too unlikely.

I do not see how logic dictates the conclusion
that;
The creator must have been created.

I don't think that I did say that.

There seems to be a misunderstanding here.

If I were to put forward the proposition that 'God
cannot be explained in human terms', this does not
mean that people should give up trying to do so,
or that they will do so.

Being unable to 'explain' God, does not preclude
being able to discuss God, especially when you
consider you have a whole book written (or
dictated, at least), by Him.

You can discuss anything in human terms. You may
not be able to explain it, in the same way,
though.

As above. Discussion is not explanation.

Hey, He's not mine either... I just thought you

There are always shades of grey, perhaps he meant
part of it, perhaps he was working in mysterious
ways, his wonders to perform. Who can tell?

This doesn't follow. 

Just because He can't be described, does not mean
that you should pay no heed to what He says. In
fact, you would do well to listen to Him if He
were to say something like.... "There's a big rain
coming... you better start building an ark"

I'm always looking for arguments to confound
Creationists, dogma, and the suchlike. I like the
general thrust of this one, using a Creationist
argument to attack another of their tenets, a sort
of Trojan Horse approach. I'm just not sure if its
quite there at the moment

Explained, not discussed
