Here are some things that are known about SRo.  Whether or not any of these
are connected to the AC is not known.

1. There seem to be many more mob spawn points in SRo than in other zones.
I've seen ShowEQ spawn logs of several hours of SRo activity, with a couple
of ACs, and many SGs, and they all had different spawn points.  Some people
speculate that there aren't any actual spawn points in SRo, but rather
special case spawn code that just picks a random spot on the desert.

2. If you don't do anything, the AC will eventually spawn.  Many people have
been passing through an empty SRo and come across an AC.  So, if there is a
placeholder, it is probably not something that spawns and stays up forever.

3. There is a set of SRo rare spawns.  Most of them have names that are
similar to common SRo mobs, with a small spelling difference (e.g., "asp"
instead of "an asp", or something like that).  There are also some rare
named mobs.  There is almost always one mob from the rare list up, and when
you kill that mob, another from the rare list spawns within a few minutes.
I've personally checked this out with a tracker, and it is correct.  Some
people speculate that the AC is one of these rare mobs.

4. The desert and the non-desert seem to be distinct.

5. When you see someone that cons red to you running away from a spider, you
should run, too.

6. If the AC spawns east of the merchants, and runs west, they will kill
him.  I'd tend to hang around that area, so that if he does spawn east of
the merchants, you can stop him before that happens.  It's also a good
general area to hang out anyway, because you can get a good view of the
zone.
