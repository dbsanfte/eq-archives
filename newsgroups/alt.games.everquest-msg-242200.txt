After being away for a year I see that we still have to play in
weather effects %80 of the time. Being a druid and spending most of my
time outdoors it's get annoying real quick.

But now I see that the snowstorms just never end. After about 30 mins
of that annoying wind noise I have to zone out. But it seems the
snowstorm follows you. The annoying wind noise will not stop, the only
way you can get it to stop is by completely shutting down the game.

Who at soe though that making us play in a never-ending
thunderstorm/snowstorm would be a good gaming experience ?

Just wish I was high enough level to make it stop.

Cheers,
