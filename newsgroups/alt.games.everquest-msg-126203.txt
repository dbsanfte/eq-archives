As a rogue I partnered with a couple of necros and it didn't work out very
well.  I'm not sure if this was because the combo just isn't workable, or if
the necro just didn't take the time out to figure out a good strategy for
working with a rogue. Playing my Necro I'm not sure I would choose a rogue
to partner with.  If I used my pet for him to BS against, he would no doubt
do much greater damage and draw aggro very quickly.  On the other hand,
trying the fear/kite routine would limit the places we could hunt.

I know you aren't interested in the Shaman class, but I have had much better
luck partnering with Rogues as a Shaman, and I have also partnered my Shaman
with my son's Necro and we kicked ass!  Sorry, I just had to put in a plug
for the Shaman class.  I play a rogue, necro and shaman and of all of them I
like the shaman the most.
