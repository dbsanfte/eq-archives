  any of the newer Nforce2 motherboards seem to be a good choice.  You can 
look at just about any of the major amd brands like Abit, Asus, MSI, and 
others and get roughly the same products, just price and some odd features 
are different.  
  Also since it runs, but only for a short while, have you experiemented 
with heat issues?  Try removing the side of the case and pointing a big 
desk fan right at the cpu.
