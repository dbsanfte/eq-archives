Only "bug" i have is the damn server boots me to server select when
i'm in trader mode. Havent' seen a set time so i don't think it's a
setting to keep us from being on all the time. So it's probably
another in the long string of bugs the fuktards at verant/sont
can't/won't fix. Hell. they got our money. why should they care how
inconvenient the game is to us.
