I'm sure virtually everyone who uses mana is wearing a Solstice
Earring so it's the other ear most are concerned about, the Hammered
Golden Loop is a horrible piece of tat IMO.  I'm currently wearing
Earring of Quirkiness (AC 6 Str 4 Sta 4 Agi 4 Dex 4 Wis 4 Int 4 Cha 4
HP 35 Mana 35) which is considerably less than uber but decent enough
that I don't feel the need to upgrade it to anything that isn't far
superior.

This was the best item we've seen that was going the way of the bin
so far though - an item that a brand new person raiding with the
guild for perhaps the 3rd or 4th time ever could have afforded.

Ok, I'm very familiar with this dilemma as it's very common on post
epic Rangers and Rogues, currently facing it myself in fact.  The
thing is Ragebringer and Swiftwind are actually very good offhand
weapons for much longer than their ratios might suggest as they both
have innate ATK so you're not really "gimping" your DPS all that
much.  (Dual wield is fux0red anyway but that's another post for
another day.)

Eg: Something like Bonechiller (14/17 + cold DD proc, offhand only)
might look like a clear upgrade to Swiftwind but turns out to be less
so if you're dropping almost 10% haste *in some situations* plus
shedding a chunk of ATK to wield it.  

The solution my guild uses is a bunch of "loaner" haste items ranging
from Runed Bolster Belts to a few Cowls of Mortality which people
have grown out of and these are handed out so that, at worst, all
melee are at 90-odd percent haste during raids.

We gave a guest Beastlord the priest cap off Burrower through Officer
award which I'm sure a few long serving guilding members privately
got their pants in a twist over as it's really very nice.  Now this
certainly made one person very happy but who knows how many others
cursed inwardly?  IMHO it's a lot easier to take someone getting item
x when you a chunk of points dropping off their total in return.
