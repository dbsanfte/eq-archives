Who's discussing what constitutes a threat ? The word is
' threatened '. As in your account wasn't ' threatened '.
It has nothing to do with a threat being made. The status
of your account was secure. Are you able to comprehend
yet with your self-appointed superior language skills ?
Are you able to wrap your superior helmet around the 
fact that Fort Knox being threatened and shot at by a kid 
with a pea-shooter is not threatened ?

Like anyone needed this. Now look up the word threatened
and see if it applied to your account. You really are lacking
in the old language department. If you have a learning disability
why not just come out and say so, rather than go through
these contortions to cover it up.

I saw above what you consider an explanation. You should be 
embarrassed and pay me for actually reading it.

 You will either understand, or you

Good it will save you from further making a fool out of yourself.
