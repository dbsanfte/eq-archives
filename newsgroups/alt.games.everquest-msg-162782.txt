Well, actually, given the numbers he mentioned, his success rate should be
closer to 80%.  It's not unusual at all to have bad steaks, and good
streaks.

At 117 tailoring, with geerlock, I made shawl 5, then shawl 6, each on the
first combine.  Shawl 5 was barely trivial (115), shawl 6 was far from
trivial(196-250).  Got a skillup on shawl 6 too.  I also had good success
with a few other combines at that same time.  Other times, I have horrible
luck.
