The debate wasnt intended to address celerons from 'back in the day', it
would be ILLOGICAL to "upgrade" to a machine slower than the one you have,
so the original celerons are not in debate.

MY post was about the p4 equivelent of the celeron, and THOSE are pieces of
junk.

Essentially, the intel line of processors goes in this order from least
performing to best performing.. celeron, pentium(not a specific number, just
the "pentium" name), xeon.

theres a reason why the celeron is cheaper than the same speed pentium4,
just like theres a reason why xeon costs more than both of them (both of
them put together, probably)

Intel is supposed to be releasing a processor intended specifically for the
gamers. in the p5 line I believe next year. this will be first time that has
ever been done, and I myself am looking forward to it.

From what i understand intel will release 1 more processor in the pin layout
its in now. it will be a pentium5 but it will fit the p4 sockets. if or not
it will work on p4 boards i dunno. I suspect it will be around 3.4ghz, then
from what ive heard and read I think they plan to take the p5 up to 7ghz or
so. all of this is in the works for next year though, they are milking the
p4 for as much as they can get out of it cause the top 3 p4 processors are
all faster than amd (benchmark and performance wise)
before anyone replies to that statement arguing how their amd is *totally*
the shit. go read released statements from intel and amd.
