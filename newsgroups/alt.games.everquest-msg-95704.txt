 If I remember correctly the main reason they fixed this was to nerf a
corpse dupe exploit that could be done. I even believe there was an
emergency patch to fix it where they brought the servers down on
Saturday. I don't think the /q pulling thing was their main motivation
considering people who can FD still /q out to clear aggro. However, that
was awhile ago so my memory is a bit hazy so maybe those are two
unrelated items.
