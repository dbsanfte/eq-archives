Max weapon skill for cleric is 4 points/level + 4.  (Compared to 5 x level +
5 for Warriors, and 3 x level +3 for pure casters.)

So for a level 8 Cleric, max skill in 1hb would be (36).

Various things affect skill increases in weapons.  Strength, dexterity, and
intelligence/wisdom.

One way to raise combat skills outside of fighting mobs is to duel with a
Mage, and melee against his pet.  Mages need malachite to summon their pets,
so you may want to buy some for your mage friend ahead of time to help
reimburse him.
