We should be thankful they are willing to take the time and effort to build,
manage, and upgrade a site used by many Eqers.

What the hell would you do without it?  You'd probably be here begging for
help.  I've donated to them because I understand the pain it is to maintain
systems.  Its a hell of a lot harder to do then build.  Many of you will
never understand the energy it takes to put forth this kind of work.

EQTRADERS   <<<=============   THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR TIME AND ENERGY!
