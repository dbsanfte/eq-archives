In 53 levels as a berzerk there have been about three times when I 
wanted a vision buff, and they weren't notable enough for me to recall 
where they were.  I -guess- this is nice enough, if it doesn't cost 
much, and you've been wearing a Plainsight item instead of something 
better so you could see... but I'd just tweak the gamma component a bit 
more if I were you.

Again, most people anywhere near ready to buy this have an EB item 
already, so this just saves an item slot in those few locations where 
you need one.

Are there really people who care a lot about trade skills still?  I know 
they keep making new items, are there desirable ones now, or is it still 
a case of whatever the best stuff you can make is, there's already 
better than that in the bazaar cheaper?

Faithstone for everyone!  Man my cleric and shaman loved their 
faithstone/spiritstone things.  So nice to be able to bind where they 
wanted and yet always be just a zone away from POK.  Minor ability for 
priests, good one for other gate classes, but astonishing for hybrids 
and melee

I guess this is something, never heard people crow much about raising

Heh, this is an important one for my zerker; he's actually trying to hit

Which happens so rarely that its nearly insignificant.  If 2% of my 
damage output comes from criticals, how much do I have to increase crit 
damage to add another 1% to my DPS?  (my guess, 50%)

5 points per rank?  Now thats substantial, its currently capped at 15, 
so thats a 1/3rd increase with just one rank!  Course its only 25% 
increase for the second rank, 20% for third rank... diminishing returns.

Er, sleight?

This will make it harder to kite, harder to pull mob off someone, harder 
to PL via DS... I suppose -some- classes will like it.

See what I'm talking about?  3% increase.  Versus the 33% increase that 
the mana regen thing is slated for.  They seem to have no consistancy at 
all.

Increases by how much, is this a healing adept mastery thing or an 
expansive mind thing?

People still research?  I capped that skill out on my mage and yet never 
actually used it once other than for a couple of my early pet spells.

Don't they normally last 12 hours?  Doesn't seem like a big change.  Or 
does this mean they persist across zone lines?  Or does it apply to 
things with short durations like werewolf?  If so, does the caster have 
to have this, or the target?  Does it apply to AA abilities?  To clicky 
items like ye olde DE mask (of the deciever)?

Soooo... normal chance to riposte is what, 10%?  If thats right, then 
this reduces that by 2% per rank, equating to a 2% increase in DPS; at 
least thats better than what the Veteran's Wrath ability looks likely to 
do.  Will be much better against autoriposting mobs, of course, but note 
that for anyone but the MT it should be useless almost all the time; 
standing in the rear arc avoids 100% of ripostes for no AA cost at all.

As a Berzerk I'd like to protest!  As a tanking cleric I'd like to 
protest!  As a mage, I'd like to tell my pet to put some points into AA 
quick and get this.

Umm, by how much?  This detail keeps being skipped, and its hard to

OK now thats just weird.  I guess they are trying to make dual weilding 
competitive with 2 hander use again.  To me, this is irritating, there 
-should- be a tradeoff in my opinion.
