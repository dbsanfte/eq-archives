In the light of this reaction to druids from Erik...

...heres another one. Oh a cleric cant get a group? "Boo-fucking-hoo"

You're now one of three viable healing classes, instead of the only one, and
still the premier at it. As opposed to the how many classes expected to deal 
damage? Or enchanters who have to 'compete' with bards and necros?

Excuse me while I weep tears of blood for you poor babies. I sympathise not
at all with the idea that clerics will now sometimes have to wait LFG sometimes
instead of everyone else LFG'ing waiting for a cleric.

And even still; I dont see druids replacing aego, rezzes, or the variety and
power of the cleric heals any time soon.
