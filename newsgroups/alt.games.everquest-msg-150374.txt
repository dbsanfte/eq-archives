Half Elf Druid? Eeegad.  Not exactly the best combo to play with at the
start. :)

To get the game mechanics down, start a warrior.  Go with a Barbie Warrior
and set him up so you can get his stats so that they're something like...

STR 115
STA 105
AGI 100
DEX 80
and so on and so on

Or you can go the more stamina route and dump 10 more points into it dump
whatever the remainder is into Dex and not bother to put anything into
strength.

With a barbie warrior you'll have good faction so you'll get to understand
and get to know your way around Norrath a bit better.

The first week or so of playing you'll probably get frustrated... but after
that you'll be hooked... soon you'll require an ethernet port installed into
your cranium so you can plug in and dream of electric sheep. :)
