"High Fantasy" tends to refer to idealistic hero stories. Good guys
are clearly good, heroic, and pure. Bad guys are clearly evil. The
world in general is "pure", clean, and generally ordered (Legend).

Low fantasy, then, would refer to a fantasy world in which the lines
between good and evil are unclear, the world is dingy, corrupt, and
chaotic (Willow).

The "myth" series would fall more into the category of satirical
fantasy... Not outright comedy, but definately not a serious story
either. Satire can't exactly be used to guage what's appropriate for a
fantasy setting...
