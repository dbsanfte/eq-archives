It's been a while since I did the camp with my ranger but from what I
could tell, the mammoths don't have any placeholders. Or at least 3 of
the mammoth spawns don't. As soon as you kill one, the next will pop.
Most of the spawn points are in the area of the wayfarer camp but they
can spawn in the far south also so if I was hunting and didn't see a
mammoth repop, I'd do a sweep of the rest of the zone and always find
one up. My ranger spent 2 or 3 levels there, never killed a
placeholder and had mammoths up continuously. 

Rgds, Frank
