I don't know. What percentage of people has to know you before you are a 
celebrity?

How many mortals? 41? 500? Does he stop being a god if he's killed by 
499, then? As far as I'm concerned, as long as they are supernatural, 
the level of power they have is not terribly relevant. Traditional 
European gods were built at a more human scale... I don't think any of 
them had any pretences of omnipotence. And besides, omnipotence 
necessitates monotheism; you cannot have *two* omnipotent gods. :)
