Wow, I really didn't expect a throw-away tagline to blossom into such a
large discussion :)
I have, actually, done extensive mapping of Kunark, and some of
Antonica. I can tell you now: Kunark is not physically possible!
Cabilis fits together fairly nicely by itself, but can only touch one
of the four surrounding zones at any given time if the four surrounding
zones are placed down around it end to end. Lake of Ill Omen is so
elongated and disproportionate to it's surrounding zones that fitting
in is impossible. Overthere, Warsliks, FoB, and Frontier Mountains fit
together well enough, but then they run into Lake and Dreadlands.
Firiona Vie really gets knocked out of place by Lake and Swamp.

I'm convinced Kurn's Tower is a TARDIS, and that perhaps Kunark does
not literally exist on Norrath, as the empty space in Timorous Deep
isn't big enough to encompass even half of Overthere.

At any rate, I'm pretty sure the artists scaled the zones in such a way
that they "looked" good enough to fool visual senses, as a distance of,
say 100units does indeed "look" farther away in E. Cabilis than it does
in FoB. Noticably so. This would fit with the scaling neccessary to
have Cabilis actually "look" like it fits in between the four
connecting zones.

Xiphos - Lake of Ill Omen, though, is just messed up. No ammount of
scaling will ever make that fit.
