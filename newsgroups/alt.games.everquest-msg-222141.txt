Because exp mobs don't stun you all that much.

Not in the LDoN groups I've been doing recently.   Bard seems to make one of
the best dedicated pullers.  Thier pacify song appears to work much faster
than casting it around, and since they won't be tanking they an leave early
to begin preparing the next pull.   Them leaving early also doesn't kill
your groups dps.

Last 3 bards I've grouped with have been very good pullers.   The next mob
was constantly arriving about the exact second the current target died, and
if they ever did get 2, they just mezed it since they knew it was coming.
If the pull did come in a second earlier, they just mezed it for a tick then
as well.

I thought it was worth expanding on, since many seem not to realize exactly
what rogues can do in this situation.
