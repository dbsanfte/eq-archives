So I'm in Ocean of Tears and finally got the siren camp to myself for a
while. This, of course, requires swimming back and forth between islands
regularly. (Swim skill nearly maxed, though. Yeah!) I'm coming back from
the one spawn swimming to the two spawn, and I see the boat bearing down
on me. Well, I'm pretty fast, so I figure I'll beat it.
  Nope. I hit the front of the boat and it scoops me up. Now, I have
zero interest in sailing to butcherblock so I run above decks and head
for the rail. On the way I hit my "/pet guard me" key to make sure old
Kibbener is still following me. "Guarding you, Master." 
  Cool. I leap off the ship and swim to shore. I turn to see... nothing.
No pet. I start hitting pet commands. No response, but also I don't get
the "You don't have a pet" signal. So where's Kibbener and the nice
bronze two handed sword I gave him?
  All I can figure is, still on the boat heading for a Holiday in
dorfland.
"Doing something stupid, master."
Aren't these guys supposed to be able to warp, go through walls, and
move heaven and earth to get back to their master?
Sheesh.
