You can get the drops in Velks easy enough, unless you really 
feel the need to do the MOB kills yourself, by just going there 
and checking the various camps.

Some nights are good, some are bad, but my lvl 30 chanter 
managed to get all the ND threads in a week of occasional visits.

Some as a result of casting Clarity or Haste on people, so they 
felt obligated to send a tell, but more than half from people 
who didn't need and hate to see stuff rotting.

If the chanter were my main, I expect it would've taken less time.

Now, if those biles would just drop a bit more often.....
