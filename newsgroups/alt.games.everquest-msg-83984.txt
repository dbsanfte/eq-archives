This whole thing is really not worth arguing over, because I do actually in
general agree with you on what names are and are not acceptable, regardless
of what the guidelines say.  (You seem to be having some trouble with this
rules vs guidelines thing too).  The way that they state the guidelines,
seems to imply that they are more than just guidelines, specifically, when
they talk about banning an account for violating a guideline.

What you are saying, is that the name Lokari passes your personal definition
of what is OK in the game.  It does however violate the guidelines that we
players have been provided with, whether intentionally or not.  I agree that
most likely a GM would do nothing about it, but a GM would be perfectly
within his rights to change the name if it were pointed out to him.

Personally, I find the name acceptable too, and I also find other names that
violate these guidelines acceptable.

Read back through any of the threads on this issue, the argument against
names that people deem unacceptable always seems to come down to two issues.
One, it violates the fantasy setting, which I agree with completely.  Two,
it is against the rules, and the person who chose the name is a stupid idiot
who has a need to violate the naming "rules".  All I'm saying is you can't
have it both ways, either there are rules, or there aren't.
