    One of our guild monks just quit for the fourth time. One time he went
back to 60 from level 5 after having bound himself underwater on the
previous attempt. He was up to the mid-20's when that patch with the "skills
cap two levels above your current level if you de-level" thing went in,
which was too bad - you wouldn't believe the things a character with the
skills of a level 60 monk can solo.
