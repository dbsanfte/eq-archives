Obviously not. However, as has been pointed out, that's not comparable
to what has happened here.

Before SoL was released, you could not equip a beast master with a
fungi tunic. After SoL was released, you could not equip a beast
master with a fungi tunic.

Nothing has changed, unlike in the hypothetical scenario you are
presenting.

And since nothing has changed, the "fun" potential of the beast master
is unchanged. It seems absurd to me that the property of "fun" might
be dependent upon one single item out of thousands in the game.
