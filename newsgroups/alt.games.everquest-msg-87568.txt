Hehe, i wondered why noone mentioned this one earlier. I found a 
tinkerer to make me a 5% tailoring device, and got a telescope of her 
too. Usually give her name out to friends and guildies who need.

As a meelee, i would probably try to find another item, since the glimpe 
spell can be irritating, but as a druid it dont matter, i just cast 
spells on raids anyway. Its even a good this for us druids, since we get 
closer screenshots of the mobs with the glimpse spell :).
