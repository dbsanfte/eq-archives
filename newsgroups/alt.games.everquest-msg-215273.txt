Sounds like either your XP CD is not bootable or your computer is not
set to boot from the CD in your system's BIOS.  Is this hard disk new
or did it come from another system?  If it's not new and had W2K or XP
on it before, the "scrabbled" screen might be what we in the industry
like to call a BSOD (blue screen of death).  Windows tries to load but
is detecting the incorrect hardware and crashes.  It dumps the
contents of it's registers, driver that cause the fault, call stack,
and some other useful information for debugging.  So, when you first
boot the machine, press either F1, F2, Del, F11, F12, or what ever key
it is to get in to your system BIOS (it will usually say when it
boots.  If a spash screen comes up, press ESC to remove it).  Then
make sure your computer is set to first boot from the CD-ROM.
