It's been a while since the patch message, but here goes.  

Charmed pets take experience based on the percentage of damage they
do. Summoned pets are different.    

With a summoned pet, you do one point of damage and the summoned pet
does all the rest, you get the majority of the experience (might be
100% or 95%).  If your summoned pet does all the damage, you get no or
1% experience, so always hit it with something, even if it is only
Burst of Flame.


With some nuking support and a fire shield, a focused Ward of Xegony
can kill the birds in PoN or a trash mob in PoI.  I pull with a resist
debuff and let the pet get the mob to 80% before I start to nuke.  I
usually get a cleric or druid to HP buff the pet when possible.  
(Faith or Fortitude are cleric AC/HP buffs that don't use gems;
Fortitude lasts over 2 hours but Faith is 160 more HPs and 5 more AC.)
Protection of the Cabbage fits between the two cleric spells,
increasing AC by 24 and hitpoints by about 470.  I prefer PoI as the
mobs don't run away, but it is harder to find a spot there without
other players getting near the pet.  

You asked about solo, but partner with just about anyone and you can
finish off more mobs faster.  Another mage = 2 pets and half the
nuking. An enchanter = slow/cripple on the mobs, so the pet is healthy
longer. Shaman = slow, DoT's, a second pet and better healing. Necro =
pet, snare, DoT's or nuking help. Ranger = snare, archery damage, and
perhaps some healing help.
