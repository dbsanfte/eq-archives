I'm new so I find this whole camping thing ridiculous. For example, I've
spent most of my time so far in Greater Faydark. When I go and scope out
the orc camp I don't care how many people are there. When the orcs come
for a fight, I'm joining in. I'm an elf. That's what I do: kill orcs.
It's a game and I'm trying to play my character.
