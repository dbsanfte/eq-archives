Ah, I see your crack dealer got out of jail early! (j/k).  Forget the
epics for the moment and pick, say......... the warrior's crafted armor
quest. Let's assume for a moment that you're an ubertwink with all the
cash that normally carries, so you can afford a selection of very
valuable gemstones to turn in to the centaur.  Now, let's go get your
breastplate. The talon is no drop. Unless you are talking about somebody
else turning in the talon for you (in which case, you're not really
"doing" the quest yourself, are you?) how do you propose to loot that
talon?
