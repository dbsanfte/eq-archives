What you're overlooking DT, is even if it was determined you did in fact
_agree_ to the terms and conditions, it could be totally irrelevant.

What is important is whether the terms and conditions of the contract 
[ and that's what you are establishing ] are legally enforceable, abide by
contract law, and do not violate any other provisions of consumer regulations, 
state / federal or constitutional law. 

Companies can put anything and everything they want [ and do ] in their
EULA's, but fortunately for the consumer, it's not the company which has
the final say as to the validity of those terms and conditions.
