Because he insists on blaming the druid for his own stupidity.

I don't mind that he didn't know about druids and BB/GFay. What bugs
me is that he tries to blame his own ignorance on other people, as if
it's their fault, and play it up like porting to BB instead of GFay is
a crime.

It's like asking an enchanter for clarity, getting breeze because the
enchanter isn't L29 yet, and then bitching the enchanter out for not
telling him.
