I have seen lots of places where people have a good picture of their
character. Is there some way in EQ to get a charater portrait .. so to
speak? Now, I don't mean taking a screenshot ... I have tried  all the views
and you can never get a good shot of yourself. It's either from the top, the
back or the side from far away.

I am thinking the only way is to get someone else to take a few screen shots
and then email them to me. This seems like a bit of a pain in the butt
though.

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!
