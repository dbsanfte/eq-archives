I'm not a computer guy at all, but I have to add my exp on this.

I recently added all the expansions to my CPU (had been playing basic eq),
and was drooling at the enhanced graphics, but it was giving me terrible
lag, so I started playing around with the settings (BTW -- I have a P4 1.5
with 3X256 megs of RAM and am using a ethernet cable modem).  Once I changed
from default I had the same problem as described here, basically word for
word.  I finally played around with the settings until it stopped (it simply
would not allow me to turn everything off), and I haven't had a problem
since.  Just wondering if it's connected or if his is modem-based, I'm
assuming mine is graphics card based.
