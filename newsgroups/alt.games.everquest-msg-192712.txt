Server values can vary. What you are offered for an item depends on 
1) what you are selling
2) to whom you are selling it
 a) in the case of selling to players, where you sell it
 b) in the case of selling to merchants, your CHR

Some items are only important to merchants. Gem Finders and pus-filled
rat hides sell to vendors for around 30 platinum, depending on faction
and charisma. Players won't buy them until you are trying to sell it
for less than they could get it from a nearby vendor. Your faction can
be so low  that the merchant won't buy or sell to you at all but they
might be allied with the merchant. If the merchant will sell to you,
check your charisma; a low charisma means the merchant will offer you
less and charge you more. Invest in some +CHR gear and put it on when
selling to or buying from npc merchants. Also different merchants may
offer different prices; check around before selling to the closest
npc.  

Some items are only important to players. Things like spider silks,
non-ruined bear cat or wolf pelts, golden ear studs (a Qeynos quest
reward earring with +3 INT) and bone chips can sell for platinum to
players; npc merchants will only give you gold or silver regardless of
your faction and charisma. 

When selling to players, where you are trying to sell it makes a
difference. If you're in Dreadlands, batwings sell well because they
are used for most levitation spells and the terrain is hilly and there
are no bats; trying to sell them in East Commons is tougher because
there are bats that drop wings and there is an npc vendor that sells
wings and the terrain is mostly flat so levitation isn't needed as
much.
