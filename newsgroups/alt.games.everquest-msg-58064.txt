Lol thats complete crap.   Excluding uber mobs (on the level of Vindi,
Statue and King Tormax) a SK makes as good of a MA as a warrior, and in some
cases a better one.

Sk's are the second best pullers, they can achieve certain things a monk
can't without something like eye of zomm (using dot's and fd to split
impossible camps)

Sk's are (IMO) the second best tanks/MA's (its just a personal opinion that
they are slightly more offensive geared then a Paladin... 1 example, compare
HT and LoH)

I've done most camps in Sebilis with an SK as the MA.. heck I have been the
MA myself in Sebilis, Charasis and for a phinny raid (Im a monk) and never
had a problem.

HT resist rate : very few mobs  (that i can recall atm) have ultra high MR
at a level where you would be soloing them.. by ultra high i mean mobs like
sprite golems in PoH (just seen your highest was 42 so you have never seen
them..they are one of the highest resist type of mobs in the game)

The only time ive had HT resisted was when i was being stupid.. like HTing a
level 50 mob when im level 6... My SK has been pleveled a fair bit, so I've
quite often fought constant red mobs in a row, in OT and GD they never
resisted HT (not ultra red mobs, e.g. mid 30's fighting the giant fort in
GD)

I always press the taunt button.. if for nothing more then to max the skill

I set my sense heading to be my left and right arrows, so just the simple
act of moving would be working the skill up.

My only gripe with Sk's (and this includes Paladins too) is that gd shitty
damage output. I feel like im perma slowed on my SK after playing my monk
some heh
