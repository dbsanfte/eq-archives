Other animals destroy life to survive.... It's another one of those
"where do you draw the line" things.

And my point is that not eating meat makes no difference in the state
of the world.

We kill to survive. It's called "natural order". No, it's not
necissary to kill animals for their meat to survive. But it's also not
necissary to kill plants to survive, either. But you do have to do one
or the other. How is one any less "right" than the other?

So, you're implying that these creatures you feel so much kinship to
that you can't bear to kill them for food act purely on instinct?

Willpower, maybe. But comfort is hardly a measuring stick to use to
draw the line if you want to make a strong case. It makes your
argument bear as much weight as the Greenpeace guys riding an old,
worn gas-powered boat around an oil platform to protest the water
pollution when the boat is probably leaking petrol and motor oil
itself...And possibly even feuled as a result of that very platform.

And, as I said, your farmland damages the habitat of animals. The
house you live in came at the same cost. The car you drive pollutes
the air. The power plant that generates the electricity to power your
computer (Let's not forget the byproducts of manufacturing the
computer), etc at work and home pollute the air. Thousands of animals
a day die on the road to drivers who never know it happened. The
byproducts from making our clothes pollute the water, killing fish.
The trash we put by the curb every day poisons the ground making the
landfill a place that is inhabitable to most animals except
scavangers. Our very existance comes at the cost of other animals
every day. What would you do, have all the beef cattle set free?
They'd become extinct in a couple decades at most, I'd wager.

In the grand scheme, not eating meat makes a trivial difference. It's
like removing a few bricks from the ton you're about to drop on
someone.
