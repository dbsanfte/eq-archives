Having an RL friend who (was) in Pak'Cafan, you might like them, but they've
had some serious issues since DAoC came out and a significant chunk of them
moved. www.pakcafan.com

I like my guild, Nox In Incendium, we've got a large spread of level ranges,
54 to mid-20's or so (with a few exceptions) web server is currently down
while the webcleric moves houses, lol.

I would've told you to go ask on www.abiplanet.com but they seem to have had
some factional issues and aren't working anymore...

Not too familiar with most guilds though.

Or you could just gain 5 levels and join ED or Enrapture or another
Uber-guild. =P
