First off there is nothing exciting or exotic about running through
West Karana for the 10th time. There is nothing exotic about sitting
and waiting for morning before running through Kithicor (the 10th
time). There is nothing exotic or exciting about taking the boat
between Freeport and Butchblock the 10th time.

The world of EQ is static. Once you learn the rules (eg run along the
shore in WK, don't travel in Kith at night, or sit on your ass for 20
mins so you don't forget to get off the boat) travel becomes nothing
more than an exercise in tedium. I just can't justify wasting what
little play time I have running through zones I have no intention of
playing in. For me it isn't about the most efficient way to grind exp.
It is about the most efficient way to enjoy the game.

If Sony wanted to be truly innovative they should code in dynamic zone
content. (similar to the Holloween events, or the coldain ring
wars..ESPECIALLY in the lowbie and mid-level zones)). If zones
actually changed (different mob types, different degrees of
difficulty, etc) randomly, then there would be more incentive to
travel through zones rather than porting around them.
