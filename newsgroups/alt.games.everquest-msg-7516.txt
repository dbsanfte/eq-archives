I notice that many of my "joking" tells - or regular tells for that
matter - get misinterpreted a lot.  It's easy to forget that there are
lots of different types of people who play the game, and many of them
are kids/pre-teens who take everything way too seriously, and/or can't
tell you're joking unless you put "hehe" or "lol" or ")" at the end of
your tells.  I would just ignore that guy...personally I like talking
to people who type things to me other than "sow plz" or "you camping
this spot?"
