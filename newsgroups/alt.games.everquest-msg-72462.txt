I need help as a 20 Druid to figure out the boat routes here. I got on
the boat from Oasis of Marr and got off at Timorous Deep. It is very
dangerous there on the shore where the dock is with the Ogres. I cast
invisible and waited on the one dock end I saw near the Wise Ogre, but
did not see the barrel barge. Then i saw a notice that it had left. I
was afraid to go any further up the coast to look, because an Ogre is
right there on the shore. I have been trying to get to the Overthere
to eventually get to Lake of Ill Omen , but am having a time of it. 
Thanks,
             Linda
