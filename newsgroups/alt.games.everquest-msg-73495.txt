Oh, I guess I should have checked that.  I guess that EQmaps is my friend.

Well, we ended up doing the first battles with 12, and a camped out 
cleric.  We had wurm-farming going pretty well, but kept getting aggro 
from wanderers, which didn't make sense.

OK, we noticed this.  We were camped in the little alcove above and to the 
left of the A on the http://www.eqmaps.com/m2/vpeak2.jpg map.  We had been 
told that this is a no-aggro spot, but I think we learned a couple things 
about this spot:  It's only no-aggro if you're sitting WAY back in the 
corner; fighting anywhere other than way back in the corner is a bad idea; 
and the pulling monk should stay feigned during the battle.  We had two 
wipeouts caused by the monk standing up and then Silverwing and Hoshkar 
rushing in to join the party.
I guess I should ask if this is a safe spot, and if so, how far from the 
very back can we be and still not aggro the wanderers.  Or maybe this is 
just a bad camp spot.

Yeah, these we could chain-pull with 2 groups and only a single cleric.

We didn't run into these ones, how common are they?  We'll need two tanks 
and two clerics I guess for these ones, but we were pulling 3 wurms 
between med breaks, so I think these will be easy, especially when we get 
a full raid force inserted.

Yeah, this was the first one we pulled.  Once we knew what to expect these 
guys were dropping pretty easily, though I was very suprised when I ended 
up the only tankish sort standing on this guy.  Cleric died early, and 
Pally died after LOH.

Actually, I ended up only about 1/4 blue down for the night, which I 
consider a hell of a good first night in any tough zone.  Especially a 
bard (aggromonkey).

We can do west wing ToV, and can sort of do NToV, but we can't move with 
any real speed yet.  The guild set VP as a goal when it formed, and has 
been working towards it for a long time.  We're not really looking for 
drops there as much as just saying that we've done it, though getting a 
couple of green scales would be nice.

Yeah, we're well aware of this.  We've got the double-rez down, though a 
couple of folks messed it up and dueled before the rezzing cleric was 
ready.

Not yet, but I'll keep a look-out for him.  If he's 62 I'll see him on 
track easily, if he's 61 I'll have to ding 60 before I know who he is.
