I don't think he was denying US complicity in the Afghan mess, only 
that there is a possibility that Bin Laden is lying about having been 
part of the anti-Soviet resistance. Sitting out the war in comfort in 
Saudi Arabia, and then making up stories about his involvement seems to 
fit his profile, but like Dan, I don't have any actual info one way or 
the other.
