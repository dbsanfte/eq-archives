Right back at you, kid.

Wharf Rat is wrong. The many other other people who disagreed are
right. Those groups prefer bottom posting.

Maybe when you get to junior high your own reading comprehension level
will be adequate to the challenge of deciphering "top" from "bottom". 

Btw, Wharf Rat was insulting you and people like you. I find it quite
amusing you didn't catch on to that.
