There are several Enchanter spells called Imbue Justice/Valor/Disease/etc
that are supposed to summon an item.

There are also new jewelry items that require things like "Green Diamond of
Disease", etc.

Speculation is that the spells use a raw diamond as a component and summon
the diamond used in the jewelry.

I'd hang onto them.
