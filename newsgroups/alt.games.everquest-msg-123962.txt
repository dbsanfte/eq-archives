I would suspect it had more to do with the chipset, not teh CPU - VIA is
notorius for having some rather particular chipset difficulties. SB Lives
were giving problems at one point as well with earlier bios revisions.

For the record, I am AMD+nVidia+xp. Have played Camelot with no trouble, but
I certainly won't try and say that the VIA chipsets are problem free.
