I'm not sure a pile really does it justice.  We generally prefer
bardic pulls (anything more than a metric buttload of mobs is a bardic
pull).  I think the record was 14 mobs on a single pull.  Only 2 of
them were fire giants.  :)
I guess that's another thing you do on long boring camps, see who can
pull the most mobs back.  Generall, you want them to give exp to a
level 50, but if you wanna pull other stuff, we'll count it.  Just
hope none of 'em get a stun off.
