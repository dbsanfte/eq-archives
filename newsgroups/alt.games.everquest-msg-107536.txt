Nope. If its a 'rain' type spell that hits in waves then the target
has to be stationary.

AoE spells are a real puzzle in EQ. They are always touted as being
powerful but if you cast them in any normal group situation they almost
always get the caster killed.

And when people do find a zone or a technique that lets you use them
effectively then Verant nerfs it.
