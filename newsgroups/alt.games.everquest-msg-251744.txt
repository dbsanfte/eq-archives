I've heard that this is happening because of some trouble in AT&T's network
which most players' packets pass through on their way to VS as well as the
SOE run UK servers. Dunno if that's true or not. Any KB/AB players getting
mass LDs?

I'm not affected FWIW, connected through Swedish Chello/UPC. Today my whole
raid except the 2 characters I was playing and one other went LD twice.
Same thing during the other mass LD incidents lately, I stay on without a
hitch.
