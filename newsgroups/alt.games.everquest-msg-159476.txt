I was using Pacify to pull in the hole, where the mobs are notoriously magic
resistant, and have 8 observations:
1.  Never had a resist-train... so beneficial is sweet.
2. The group gets really wierded out when the enchanter is pulling.
3. The duration seems horrendous...  I had to swap out pacify to put up my
nuke on a tough fight (golem), and just said 'aw heck' and decided to pull
both the elementals I had pacified earlier.  Mez em in camp. ToT the caster
and only he came.
4. I look wicked cool in my Insidious robe with illusion iksar up.
5. When pacify wasn't used I was a very very busy chanter... I think they
may have increased the assist radii a bit.
6. A guild druid wouldn't stop whining about the harmony nerf and how hard
it was to setup his quad kites now, and that he might have to go back to
root rotting. (my heart fair bleeds for him, really)
7. I never, not once, not ever, got more than I was expecting on a
pacify-pull, and I was in there 4 hours. Mind you I never used pacify on
anything not blue to 51.
8. Pacify is so good you can pull a mob almost through another and not get
agro.
