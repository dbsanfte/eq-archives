Absolutely. Reason being that druids are pretty much forced to solo at
the high end, hence they need to have better offensive skills than a
cleric who is pretty much always accompanied by his/her pet tank. It's
not like druids at the high end ever really *use* their melee skills;
but I think it's fair from a class balancing perspective. The price you
pay as a cleric for being the most desired healer class, and for having
better ac, etc. is being weaker offensively. The price I pay as a druid
for being able to solo is wearing leather armor and having a harder time
finding a group. /shrug
