The horse shows up in the buff bar, and other people who have my SOL model on
see the horse.  But if they are used to seeing people on normal horses, they can
tell that I have something different going on if they watch, because I don't
have that weird slow start slow stop thing going on when I move, my horse moves
like a normal unhorsed person.  Clicking the horse buff icon off removes the
horse effect instantly, and people around me see the horse go away (except for
that bug that sometimes leaves the horse standing around)

In fact there are times when people have difficulty doing things with me because
the horse is up, and I have to dismount and remount to clear that up... even
though to ME there is no horse at all!

Clicking the bridle gives a 3 second cast if I don't have horse up, once horse
is up I get an instant "you are already on a horse" message, and the gem refresh
effect.  (also, get my mana bar updated)

If you are some kind of elf, you may have to turn off wood elf model as well as
your own.  There may be some other even less logical model interactions that
don't work.  This is why the first plan is to turn off ALL models except horses,
and see if that works; once it does, you can go back and turn on a few and test
again to see if they cause trouble for you.
