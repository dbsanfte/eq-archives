Oh suprise...here comes Dan...

at any rate, for the shortbus crowd, I replied to Lokari's post.  see that
for the explanation you "folks" so unjustly deserve

Posting peoples personal info is a BAD thing.  Say it with me.

You dweebs; is it too hard to fathom that some people who would otherwise
*fuck* with people (as in RL stalking kind of *fuck* with), don't know
anything about message headers and wouldn't even know where to look?  Of
course we've all educated them proper here in a.g.e now haven't we?  Oh hey,
and we have StanMann to save them the trouble by just listing it right out
there in the open - in a POST to the newsgroup - AND as an added bonus, if
enough potential sick-fucks haven't had their curiosity piqued by the
freebie info...lets cross-post it to a hacker group!!! Woooohoooooo!  Nothin
wrong with that! - all in good fun... puh-fuckin-leeze.

Jesus H. Christ on a crutch even!

Posting peoples personal info is a BAD thing!  Forget the headers!  99.9% of
the people reading don't even know what the fuck a HEADER is!

Sometimes I just can't believe I enjoy and participate in a game that is
also patronized by fucking idiots like some of the ones posting here...just
beyond me.

This isn't necessarily for you DH or Lokari either for that matter...you two
just like to mix it up and I can appreciate that. heh
