	As a matter of fact, it does.  And how many of them have Rangers?  Humans
have a continent-wide empire to control, Wood Elves have half a continent (the
Faydarks) -- and they used to control the now-Human lands, meaning their
Rangers would likely persist as a cultural legacy anyway.  Rivervale controls
a tiny piece of land with a fortification keeping out their only real enemy,
and they're surrounded by the Humans in any case.

	They may be corrupt, but they can't let armies freely move through their
territory; they have to at least preserve the illusion.
