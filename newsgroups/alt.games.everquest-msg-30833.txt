    Coin is an issue, but for items have the master looter simply hand them
out as they loot them. We do that with gems on occasion, and everyone is
pretty happy about it. I don't begrudge the person before me if they got a
sapphire and I got the fire opal - it's luck of the draw, and it smoothes
things out. The people who are driven berserk by it are the power looters -
not because they can't pull in a huge wad of cash, but because sometimes
people get MORE than they do!

    Last time I did this, it was the druid that was the whiner. We were NBG,
and he wanted to roll "for his warrior". Every time a valuable gem dropped,
he would ask "who are we on now?" When we had to quit before his turn in the
current cycle of planar gems, he of course moaned and complained about that
too. But why did we have to stop? Well, after we watched a ten mob train run
past us towards the zone-out, we all started asking for evac. The druid,
clearly hiding his low level with anon, sat down, MEMMED AN EVAC (glad the
train went a ways before coming back to us), and evacced us from Sebilis
to.... South Ro. Oops. Glad I needed to sell anyways. ;-)
