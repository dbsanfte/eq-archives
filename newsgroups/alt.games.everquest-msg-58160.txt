Magician's rely on thier pets, so total starting Intelligence is not
the most important asset.

I would pick.........Dark Elf

1. Racial Ability "Hide"
Many times you will lost your pet due to pathing problems in a zone.
If you are in a dungeon this can mean a massive train will arrive when
your pet finally returns to you. The easiest way to get rid of a rogue
pet is to go invisible. The "Hide" skill allows you to do this without
spending mana or having to use an item. The skill also gives you the
ability to med in peace if your pet is dead/gone and you are out of
mana.

2. Ultra Vision (best night vision in the game)
At level 16 mages get the spell "Summon Heatstone", and thus gain
infravision. Later they get "Summon Coldstone" and gain Ultravision.
You have to burn mana to summon these items and it can add to your
start up time when you log in to play.

Other than that it really doesn't matter what race you pick. 

Magician's are one of the most balanced Race/Class combo's in EQ.

Cheers
