My mains are on EMarr (with some secondaries on Saryn and Sullon).  My
characters doing the experiment with are on Karana, since I had no other
characters there to begin with.

My character selection slots for EMarr are full....and I'm too attached to
them all (even the mule ones) to delete them.

Thank you for the offer, though,  Celaeno!
