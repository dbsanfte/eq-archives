I have been working on my tailoring for a long time, and want to know the
best route to take.  I was told by a friend to make ceremonial solstice
robes because they sell for a lot.  Well I notice that they cost a large
amount of plat to "try" .  My tailoring is at 157 and before he said
anything i was farming acrylia and making studded armor.  My question is,
Will my skill increase at the same rate making the robes as it would making
something that is not that far out of my reach? I thought I read once that
if you attempt to make something that is too far above your current skill
lvl, that you will not skill up as fast.

TIA
