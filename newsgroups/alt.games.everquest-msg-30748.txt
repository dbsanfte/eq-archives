I had exactly the same problem with exactly the same zone and it was also my 
Druid that sparked the event.  It started after the last but one patch.  I 
tried emailing Verant, and putting a posting in their Tech Support forum - 
neither got a response from them.

I tried all the advice offered by other members - deleted the Frontier 
Mountain zone files, upped page limit, ran a 'full file check', ran virus 
checks etc etc etc.  Nothing worked.....except:

I have two accounts, and whilst my Druid from my main account was not able 
to zone into FM, I quickly discovered that the characters from my other 
account were not only able to zone in, but could play there with no problem.  
Having discovered this, I tried the first account again. Low and behold, I 
was able to log in and get out of there.

I have *no* idea what that means on the great scheme of things, but it was 
certainly very odd.
