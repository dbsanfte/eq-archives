Hmmm... not many facts about oceans... but here's some useful-ish stuff
about water in general.

Most MoBs swim at the same speed they run... so it's no use trying to swim
across a river/lake hoping to outrun them.

And you can't drown a land based MoB by pulling it into the water, either.

Some 'fish' can chase you back out of the water and halfway across the zone
if the 'pathing' is bad.

You can't cast spells from the boats... but you CAN fire a bow... if you
REALLY want to annoy your fellow passengers ;o)

Some rivers that can't be crossed by MoB (they run around the obstacle) are
actually narrow enough to jump across... but if you fall in, you'll be
fighting at a hugh disadvantage and prolly die... BE WARNED ;o)
