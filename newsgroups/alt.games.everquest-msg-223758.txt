I know, this sort of thread is done to death.

But personally, I always find them interesting, and usually end up with 
something new to file away in the old breadbox I call my brain.

So, where would you solo?  Where would you take a partner?  Where would 
you group?

I'll tell you what, usually if I can find a group its LDoN, I don't 
think I've had a pickup group do anything else in fifteen levels... 
really not since LDoN release!

No thats not true, got one last night.  Started as a Dulak run, someone 
couldn't get in to LOY despite reportedly having the expansion, moved it 
to the Hole, turned into a epic drop run, then collapsed after getting 
very close when we had a evac with one death.

Fun night really, which is probably what got me thinking outside the 
"more LDoN" box.

ps yes I know, I asked for 51+... but thats because by the time I check 
responses I fully expect to be 51
