Great idea!

In combat "aq" is enough for me...I don't care about manners either.  And
hell, I can also accept an excuse that someone is a slow typist and trying
to run across a zone so they abbreviate some words (though I don't think
"please" should be one of them).

One day (hopefully) these people will come to realize that despite it being
an old fashioned concept with no place in today's society, manners DO count
for something.

I say "congrats" or "grats" all the time...mostly because I'm saying it when
people have made an insignificant "ding" for the thousanth time (whoopee,
you're level 2, 11, 13, 14, 15... 47, 48...WHO CARES besides you??  Ask for
congratulations when you actually get something cool or it required lots of
hard work to get there), and the person is known to me (though I rarely care
any more about a friend's dings than a strangers when they announce stupid
levels).
