At level 1, 7hp and 7ac are approximately as useful as each other. At higher
levels the bonus from agility stays the same whereas the bonus from stamina
gets ever larger.

Is 120hp at level 60 meaningful? Hell yes. How many items do you see that
add that many HP? Precious few and any warrior would give their eye teeth to
own one. And that's 120hp of extra effeciency off EVERY Complete Heal you
EVER receive, and it could easily be the difference between living and
dieing.

Like I said, I play a 60 Warrior and If I had the choice of allocating my
points again I'd CERTAINLY pick 120hp over 7AC. Pretty sure most of the rest
of the world agrees with me too ;)
