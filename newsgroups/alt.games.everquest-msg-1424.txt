That's the first I've heard of it called that.

Selos doesn't get noticeably faster than SoW until level 20 or so (with
drum) so I'm assuming you're higher than that.

You'd think a bard higher than level 20 would notice the buff icon pretty
quickly. ;)  Thank god (it wasn't always this way, IIRC) you can cancel that
effect!
