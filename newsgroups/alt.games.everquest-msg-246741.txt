Kind of like a 16 year old having an infant daughter causes her 32 year 
old parents to become 'aged grandparents' right :)

The ti-series card *just* became 2 generations old. And quite frankly 
the top ti series gf4s *still* outperform most of the FX5x00 family. 
Their age shouldn't be counted against them.

In practical terms I'd rather have a ti4800 than an FX5200 or FX5400 for 
the vast majority of games.

I've been disappointed with the FX series, and this also about when ati 
really started to gain ground to, imo.

I called you a fanboi/shill in response to your using google hit counts 
as an basis for an argument.

The pricing on the Radeon cards is not ever going to go UP for the 
performance level, its not like its some deal one has to take advantage 
of.  If I were sitting on a ti4800 in my main box, and it was running 
everything that is out today just fine, (and by all accounts the card 
pretty much *is* running everything modern just fine, barring a few 
demos for games that are a few months away yet, then i would probably 
wait another 6 months, and pick up the "then-best card"... or if i was 
budget conscious the then-2nd/3rd best card... (the X800 perhaps...at 
that point). But were i sitting on a ti4800 waiting for HL2, Doom3 etc 
... there is NO WAY I'd jump to a new card in *advance* of those titles 
shipping so that I'd be ready for them. Its far more sensible (and 
economical) to wait until the games arrive, pick the best card at 
release time, when benchmarks against real cards, real drivers, and the 
real game are available... and reap the benefits of continually 
increasing performance/decreasing prices on the video card).

If you've got a ti-series g4, and your waiting for the 2004 megatitles 
with baited breath, it will last you just fine until you can make 
informed decisions, on real data, not vapourware and hype.

> unlike the
> Nvidia cards.

I wholeheartedly agree that someone in the market for a new card *today* 
is best served by ATI, no question about it.
