They don't want you to mess with it, find out a way to break it, then come 
complaining to them that there wasn't a warning not to.  In general, I 
think you only have to worry about setting the refresh rate out of range.

I do recall, with some old version of Windows (probably 3.1), having 
mis-set the resolution and getting it stuck there... I couldn't tell from 
the messed up screen where the 'cancel' button was to go back to the old 
resolution.  Can't remember if I finally found it or just reinstalled 
Windows.  But I can see a computer novice deciding it was the monitor 
manufacturer's fault, and I'm sure their lawyers could, too.
