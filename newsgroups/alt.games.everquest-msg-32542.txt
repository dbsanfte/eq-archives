You can easily make windows extremely secure. The worst
that could ever happen to me would be possibly a denial of service
attack if someone directly targetted my ip address but that is about
it. However, If I'm only really showing my ip address when connecting
to EQ, and then only to verant, its very unlikly for this to happen.
In fact I've not even had one denial of service type attempt for like
4 years.. and then it was only the kiddie denial of service phase
people went through on irc.

Really you have to go out of your way to make yourself non secure. Bad
things to do are setting it up so you or someone can log on remotely,
bad. Setting up network sharing, bad. If you only use it yourself, at
home, and approve all connections of programs to the internet you can
be as secure as heck. I even accidently downloaded some password
trojan once and zonealarm asked me if I wanted 
5748957475894.exe to access the internet and of course I said no.
