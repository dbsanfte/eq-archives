You can drag them around, and also resize some of them, by clicking on 
the small boxes on the corners. Once you are done, you can hit Alt-L to 
lock them in position. If you are more numerically inclined, you can do 
this from the .ini file too.

I would recommend you search for a graphical EQclient.ini editor, this 
will come in very handy to change the background colors and transparency 
levels, if you aren't terribly handy with the RGB format. I think you can 
find links to a few good ones in the FAQ.
