I'd make the cash and xp given for quests commensurate with the
difficulty of doing them so they become a viable alternative to
hunting.  As it is, there's little incentive to start an unknown
quest, because the odds it'll end up helping you in any way are tiny.
There's all that great content mostly going to waste, or at best to
the benefit of a few farmers.
