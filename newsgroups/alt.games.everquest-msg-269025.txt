One of the pleasant surprises in WoW has been the maturity of the
players that I've run across. After skimming the forums and thinking
back on Battlenet, that was one of the things that worried me the
most. Other than a couple of random duel invites and a few idiots that
needed to be put on ignore from the main chat channel, I haven't run
into nearly as many doods as expected.

That's my attitude towards EQ2. If my friends are still playing in a
couple of months I'll check it out. Until then, EQ1 and WoW will keep
me busy.
