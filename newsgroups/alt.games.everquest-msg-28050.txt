Now.

You can buy Lanterns for the Wood Chips quest turn-in at any level.
Ditto for the Kiola Nuts -> Tumpy Tonics -> Dwarven Wire quest.
I'm pretty sure 15/16 is a fine level for killing clockworks in
Steamfont for their Micro Servers, and you'll get good exp for it
(kill the little ones if the big ones are too tough still).
And of course Spiderlings for their silk should be trivial to you
now.

But for the big hurdle...  You need a VERY high fletching skill,
which Maeson Trueshot sort of "forgets" to tell you is a vital
part of the quest.  Buy a fletching kit, and start whacking away
at raising your skill.  Don't even think of trying to fletch a Trueshot
bow until your fletching skill is in the 140+ range, and the higher
beyond that, the better.  Expect a lot of failures, so acquire several
stacks of the components, so you can make many attempts.
