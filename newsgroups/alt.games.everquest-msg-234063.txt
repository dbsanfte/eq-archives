Even if you gave casters 10 spell slots, I don't think it would
increase their power a whole lot with the exception of some classes
soloing (a dotting necro comes to mind). People are gonna have their
powerful spells memmed anyway,   

If would, however, remove one of the annoyances of playing a buffing
class. The constant juggling of spells gets annoying and it's not fun,
which is something EQ often looses track of. A game shouldn't be
balanced by how annoying it is to do certainl things.
