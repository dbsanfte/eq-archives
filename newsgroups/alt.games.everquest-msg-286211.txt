I have retuned to EQ. I also bought the anniversary edition so I'm
also uptodate on expansions.

I decided to get my LDON stone so that traveling between zones would
be quicker or at least more convient. My problem is I thought Cabillis
was my home city (Iksar Obviously) but the NPC in East Cabillis says I
should return to my home city and ask for help. I traveled to
Mountains of Rathe and could not find the NPC mentioned on Alla's.

Could someone please assist me by either telling me how to find my
home city ( I may have changed it) or where I can find a nuetral NPC
associated with the Wayfarers that will assist me in getting my LDON
stone.

Thanks
Zebuxoruk.
