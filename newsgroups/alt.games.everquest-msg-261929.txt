Go old school.  =)

Oggok was great at that level (yes, inside the city, which is actually a
pretty cool "dungeon").  OT should be fine if you pick your fights wisely,
and good for quite a few levels.  Go to Rathe Mountains and hunt HGs for a
little bit worse exp than you could make elsewhere, but very good money. 
Lower Guk and Sol B should be great to start getting into and will last you
for quite a few levels yet (remember the earth pet).
