I am not qualified to give MA/SA advice (I play a monk) but I can give some 
advice for pickup or guild raids.

Be on time. Be ready to go. Need to go to the bank for resist gear? Should 
have done so pre-raid. 

Be patient. Forming raid groups can be time consuming.

Keep the main chat channel clear of unnecessary data. Got an add incoming, 
announce it. Have some opinion about a CD or the news, don't.

ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS assist the MA. WAIT FOR THEM TO CALL THE ASSIST. 
Unless you are the SA or a designated add-tanker.

Do not go exploring. Do not go wandering. 

If you ignore the wandering advice and find some playmates, do NOT drag 
them back to the raid unless they are trivial. It's better to die and get 
dragged and rezzed.

NO ONE pulls but the puller or the MA.

Aside from that, you will find other little quirks and tips that will help 
as you go. Keeping those rules in mind will keep you alive and get you 
invited to future raids :)
