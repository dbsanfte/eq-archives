I haven't tried Sebilis yet.  What level are the mobs there?  If they 
are green to me that lets out all the magic item drops, on FV the TLC 
will prevent them dropping at all.  NG would be a possibility, even if 
it is green, because the principle cash drops there are gems.

Sadly, I don't find mages to be great soloers in general; yes the pet is 
pretty good, and the nukes are decent too.  But with no slow, melee 
potential from the pet is similar to what a soling warrior can do.  With 
no CC at all, adds are not good.  Using stuns from the air pet as the 
only slow means only his actual target is slowed, adds do full damage.

Worse, adds that get on ME instead of the pet are often a huge trouble, 
I have no root stun or mez (unless the mobs are elementals), so I have 
to dump them onto the pet, gate out, or die.  Mistakes in POP zones are 
easy to deal with because the body will pop in GY and I can just loot up 
and go on with my life, but indoors in a spot like Seb, I have to 
exercise a good deal more caution.

Too, mana regen in an indoor zone suffers, because I can't ride a mount. 
  KEI could substitute for that, but if you were thinking KEI would make 
it faster, well, not so much, because I won't be sitting much (that 
aggro problem again)

Recalling the drops in NG, I think Jail in POJ is likely a better camp, 
kill for kill; I see one or two diamonds (each either diamond, raw, or 
blue, the latter selling for even more) per clearing, I don't remember 
the odds being that good on NG runs I've been in with groups.
