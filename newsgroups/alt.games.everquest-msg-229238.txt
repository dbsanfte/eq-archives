Spawn point strikes me as very important here.

If there's nothing to kill nearby, then you have a long walk to find 
prey.  Die, and you have a long walk to your body where your gear is... 
which won't matter so much if you are over 6 and people

Race probably matters a lot more than on normal servers too.  You won't 
be changing your stats much, or leveling up much.

Advantages that seem slight, like troll and iksar regen, are massive in 
the lower levels.

Other advantages, though, like Innorruuk worshipping shaman and cleric 
snare necklace, will be difficult to ever realize, since you have to be 
level 16 in order to complete the quest.

Vah Shir would be in great shape, with access to the ultimate hunting 
grounds, a quest that will take them practically to second level without 
ever hitting a single mob (going from 2 to 6 is easier than going from 
one to two when you are utterly untwinked, lose everything when you die, 
and competition is wiping out all the level one mobs around).  Can't be 
Vah Shir though apparantly.

Can you be Iksar?  Iksar have a -lot- of newbie zones around them, which 
should cut down the crowding a bit, and very simple newbie quests to get 
some basic gear, also they are so far away from everyone else that you 
won't have to worry about much, just your fellow SK, warrior, necro, 
monk and shaman... mostly necro and shaman.  Nobody with track, so if 
you can get some distance you should be able to level up relatively 
unmolested.

Halflings have two hunting areas in addition to their home town, but 
I've seen those areas overwhelmed with just a normal population of 
hunters.  a 10% bonus will likely bring lots of folks here, and rangers 
with track will be ready to hunt down the newly 6 whereever they try to 
hide.

Humans have several spawn sites; Freeport gives access to a few hunting 
grounds, qeynos to several more, and surefall glade... well thats not 
the best start area, especially not for the nightblind.

Half Elves can start in Surefall (not quite so bad for them) and 
Kelethin and... freeport?  Kelethin's GOT to suck, I'd bet a good third 
of the server is there, hunting down every last newbie mob when low 
level, tryhing to exp in crushbone while slaughtering each other once 
they get a bit higher.

Dwarves have... three zones of kaladim?  Plus Butcherblock, no tracking 
race until elf and half elf rangers spill out from GFay.  But dwarves 
have only one caster class, cleric, and I'm none too sure clerics will 
do well in PVP at low levels.

Gnomes, like dwarves, have their own little haven, and no trackers 
native, but they do have necromancers, wizards, enchanters, mages... and 
clerics, plus SK, paladin, warrior... and might find trackers from GFay 
spilling out.

High Elves are adjacent to GFay, with all the problems that entails, and 
the same class mix as gnomes, less SK.

Hallas is home to the barbarians, totally lacking int casters and with 
only the shaman as priest casters, this is another oddity.  Its also 
seperated from everyone else by Blackburrow, which is a difficult 
passage indeed at very low levels; will humans and half elves out of 
surefall or qeynos bother crossing blackburrow to hunt in everfrost, 
knowing that their bodies will be nigh unrecoverable if they are level 
one again?

DE and trolls share Neriak, with one of the worst newbie zones in the 
game, the spread out and low on mobs Nektulous right outside.  Nearly 
every class in the game is available here, though, between freeport and 
Neriak you're missing only druids and rangers... who aren't -that- far 
away in Rivervale if you count halflings.

That leaves Ogres and Frogloks.  Innothule sucks, frankly, but there is 
a good representative set of classes in Gukta, and the next zone over 
from Innothule is Feerrot, newbie zone of the ogres, with many of the 
remaining classes.  Both are comfortably far from any threat of rangers 
or bards.

AM I leaving anyone out?

Splendid
