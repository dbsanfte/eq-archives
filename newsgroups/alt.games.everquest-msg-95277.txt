I dont play on FV, but I believe the rule is that yo can only self bind in
cities. I guess its useful, as theres quite a few places you can bind
yourself but no solbinder. Examples are fm, kaesorea, fv, thurgadin, kael,
arena, highpass, evil outpost, and probably paineel, since you might find
the soulbinder in an inconvenient place (not sure, never seen him there).

What id like to know is... how the heck does binding restrictions (or
trivial loot code) make for an atmosphere or roleplaying? They know that we
(mostly) hate these rules, yet they persist with them and we have a heavily
underpopulated serrver. Just the tlc was enough to put me off transferring.
