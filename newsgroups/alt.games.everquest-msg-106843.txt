ACPI won't do anything to help the >512M Win95/98/98SE/ME bug.  You need to 
either lower your AGP Aperture or limit your disk cache with a 
MaxFileCache=<blah> (8192 works well) in the [VCache] section of 
c:\windows\system.ini.  The latter is a better way to handle it, since the 
former is somewhat trial and error.

The problem is that these Windows versions try to grow the cache into all 
the spare memory.  I'm fuzzy on the explanation from there, but it's 
something along the lines of the godzilla-like cache clobbering the area 
mapped to the AGP aperture.  This can cause random instability when the 
aperture is used, which will almost certainly happen with Luclin installed.  
I'd imagine that zone-time would be particularly volatile because textures 
are getting swapped in.

I'd say it's pretty likely this is causing the lockups this guy's seeing, 
assuming heat issues aren't the culprit.  Microsoft says it causes out-of-
memory errors to pop up, but I've never seen that.  Rather, I've seen it 
manifest as D3D apps locking the system tight when textures are loaded.
