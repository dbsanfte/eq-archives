You aren't limited to just playing on one server.  You get 8
characters *per* *server* (except for a couple of the "special rules"
servers, which only allow you to have one character).  No need to kill
off characters to try out new things.  Even if you have a lot of
friends on your current server, you can try new classes on another
server for a few levels, and then redo them on your main server if you
like them.

In fact, it can be useful to have characters on more than one server.
They usually don't take down all the servers for scheduled
maintainence at the same time, but rather do one group one night,
another the next, and so on.  You can put characters on servers in
different maintainence groups, so you can keep playing during
maintainence.  Only patches will get you then!
