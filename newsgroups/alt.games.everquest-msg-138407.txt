I'd suggest auction WTB Words in Mistmoore, Unrest, Lavastorm, the Karanas,
HHK/Pass and LOIO. Also, tons of words drop in Stonebrunt but hardly anyone ever
hunts there.  Check the NK gypsies and FV vendors (use a good-aligned mule for
this). This is a guess, but try the OT evil outpost if the spell can be
purchased and the SK guilds don't have it.
