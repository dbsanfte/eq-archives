I recently started a Gnome Enchanter with the goal of using her as a
Tradeskill Master.
Well, She is up to 16 now.  Even have all but the Lesser Feydark spells.
To the point.  I needed practice with Mesmerization.  I got in an Oasis
group. ( I bet you can already guess where this is going too)  Well, I asked
them to set up assist on the puller, I would mez the adds and extras.
    Did they????

    Not a chance in Hell.

     I mez, they scattered and attacked ALL the mezzed mobs.  I put up with
this for 3 pulls then left them to die as the undead waltzed thrue the area
behind the tents at the docks,  Along with the SG that killed it's Kiter.
To say the least, I was more than a little upset.  I guess they must be
Noobs, or just didn't give a darn about my crowd control.  I asked and
explained it 3 times, but to no avail.  >sigh<

As to Her trade skills?  Money will always be the issue.
