Kiling lots o' kobolds. It is your god or lack of a god which makes
you threaten or worse. Even a dark elf or trol starts out at threaten
though they get to dubious in just a few kobold kills. 

If you are going in the hole I presume you are high enough level you
could waste the kobolds fast. A wolf form may raise your faction one
level but you need amiable to get the key from the skeleton to then go
down and buy the hole key (need apprehensive or above for that) You
could have someone work the lift for you to buy the key once you were
apprehensive with the vendors. You start at dubious with the vendors
so I believe you get to apprehensive faster ? (they are all on paineel
faction but no vendor starts out below dubious)
