I have a question, my nephew wants to play everquest with my account when im
at work, now i dont see a problem with this, however i would like to protect
my characters so that he couldnt access them (i wouldnt want to come back
one day to find he had accidently done something), i was hoping you could
password your characters from EQ but you cant, then i came up with the idea
that i could put a rule in my firewall to block access to my server (luclin)
that way he could only access the other servers (and couldnt screw my
characters up) i also wanted to know if there was a way to auto logon, so he
dosent have my screen name and password, but i couldnt work it out.  Has
anybody got any clues or ways around this (other than buy another account)

Thanx in advance
Toytown
