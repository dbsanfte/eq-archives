Hey, sounds as though you're the kind of player I like.  There's nothing
wrong with having others help you out.  What bugs me is players spending
hours just trying to mooch off of higher level players.  If you haven't had
anybody beg you for money, then you're lucky or it could be your level.  The
higher you get the more beggars think platinum is insignificant to you.  And
while this is true, to an extent, why do they think they should get for free
what you earned?  I'm sure you're right in that there are probably just a
handful of rotten eggs, but they're noisome enough to make up for all the
good ones.
