My general lineup:

Mesmerise (lowest level single target mez, cheap and fast)
Mesmerization (AE targetable mez)
PB AE stun (cheapest and fastest use when possible)
PB AE stun (only if first one is greyed out)
Root (even -more- CC, plus handy for getting pet involved)
Quickness (constantly casting this)
Breeze (this is just for lack of something better to mem)
Lanquid Pace (actually pretty useless on fast dying mobs)

I haven't seen any need for Tash line thus far, although my shaman 
eventually adopted Malo line before slow as a "must do" I haven't had 
similar problems yet, Mez lands just fine, and the really important 
spells, AE mez and AE stuns would require a corresponding set of AE 
tash; no chance I'm going to be able to tash every mob in an emergency 
overpull before attempting CC on them.  I assume the key here is to go 
after harder targets which take some time to die, so that Tash is needed 
to land the slow and slow is worth casting because the mob lives long 
enough to make it mana efficient.  This was certainly the case with my 
shaman.. but the thing is, I don't think enchanters really shine at that 
sort of work, our slow isn't as good as shaman slow, after all, its CC 
thats the bread and butter of the class, but to make CC work it seems to 
me I have to be able to land mez/stuns on untashed mobs!

I could easily dump Breeze and just set up a couple saved spell lists to 
swap it and quickness around, keeping quickness up unless its rebreeze 
time.  This would clear a slot for charm.  My bard did use charm as a CC 
tool quite often to good effect, and the animations don't get much of a 
work out in a full group, so I could ditch that... I guess its something 
to experiment with.

Debuff slot you say.  Well other than Slow, I've never seen the point, 
my shaman does a fair amount of incapacitating, but he's constantly full 
of mana from KEI plus Canni and has nothing better to do with his time, 
my chanter is constantly mana starved from keeping Hastes up, while Slow 
is a palpable reduction in mob damage ( a third less... thats noticable) 
the various shaman stat debuffs improve things more on an order of 5 to 
10 %.  Are chanter stat debuffs more effective?  If I was using surely 
I'd be using a slow first... that being the case, I wouldn't want to 
have this in a swap spot since I'd be swapping every mob, unless of 
course I was grouped with a shaman, so that he would do the slow job and 
I'd have nothing better to do than stat debuff...
