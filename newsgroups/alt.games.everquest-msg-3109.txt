My Iksar shaman just reached level 10 the other day.  Except for one
short time when I grouped with a necro and monk in Swamp of No Hope,
I've pretty much soloed all the way with her.  I still currently solo;
my fighting strategy is to start out by pulling the mob with Drowsy,
then start meleeing, then cast Sicken, then Tainted Breath, keep
meleeing, re-cast Drowsy when it wears off, keep meleeing, maybe cast
Frost Rift if necessary, melee till the end.    

I probably eventually will want to start grouping at some time, as
from what I've heard, it gets harder to solo at certain levels.  Of
course, what I will do first is buff my partner/group members; what
spells should I have memorized when I group?  Should I keep mainly my
buff spells memorized? When I solo, I buff myself up first, then keep
mostly my offensive spells memorized when I fight (my current spell
slots are:  SOW, Heal, Gate, Flash of Light, Frost Rift, Tainted
Breath, Sicken and Drowsy).

Also, should I go ahead and keep casting Drowsy, Sicken, Tainted
Breath to slow the mob down for the fighter(s) or should I save my
mana for buffs/healing? 

Also, from what I've heard, I should not start healing/buffing the
fighters till they are down to 40% of their health or else the mob
will start aggroing on me, and also that I should often let the group
know my mana level so if I'm low, I can ask them to wait till my mana
level is higher before they pull anything.  Any other suggestions on
working with a group?

Also, from what I've heard, at higher levels, shamans rely mainly on
spells to kill the mob and melee very little.  What is the best
strategy for this?  (I'm still meleeing the whole time now).  

Thanks in advance.
