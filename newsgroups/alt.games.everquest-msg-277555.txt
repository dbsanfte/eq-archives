I was thinking more of the limitation on participants.  While some will
consider 24 perfect (the number I've heard, no personal experience as to
whether this is the actual limit on EQ2 raids), it limits the flexibility of
what an encounter can require.  If the limit is 24, the encounter must be
designed for even fewer because you can't guarantee a perfect class
distribution, i.e., not all groups of 24 people are equal.

It also presents the problem, assuming similar population levels on EQ2
servers as EQ1 servers, of creating a glut of guilds, since once a guild can
field their 24 participants it will be time to form another guild rather
than deal with making people sit out of raids (from experience, a difficult
thing to deal with).

Which of course exacerbates any content issues, as you now have that many
more guilds interested in the same content (alleviated somewhat by
instancing, but I assume there is some static content in EQ2 as well).
