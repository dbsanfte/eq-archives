No, other than tracking it down.

/stoptracking

...it is a fairly new feature.  For the longest time, the only way to
stop tracking was to do what you just described.

A few tips:

-If it is invisible to you, it wont show on track.  Certain mobs are
invisible (The Guano Harvester in SolB comes to mind.)  Keep see-invis
up if you would like to keep track of these mobs.  However, very few
things actually are invisible.
-Druids, I'm 98% sure, track the newest mobs first.  That is,
whichever are the newest mobs to the zone will be on the top of your
list.  When you first saw them will not affect where they are on the
list, only when the zone first "saw" them.  Rangers have the option to
sort it so that the closest are on top, or the farthest, as well as
filtering out different /con colors.
-Yes, the higher your track skill, the farther you can track.  That's
the only difference I know of.  Ranger track maxes out somewhere
around 2k units away.  Very ballpark.  Could be 1.5k, could be 3k. 
Druids tracking skill max out at 125, Rangers at 200, so I would guess
that Druids can track out maybe 1k - 2k?  This is really a guess
though.
-When practicing tracking, I assume you have figured out how to assign
the skill to turn keys or some other often-used function?  If so, I
might suggest minimizing the tracking window and leaving it open at
all times.  When you actually want to track something, simply open it
since it will show a fairly recent sample.  These units are based on
/loc commands and the position they place you on the map.
