Well i just had a good experience with a guide on xegony over a twilight quest
npc taking my items and not giving me the bracer when she responded after about
40 minutes the first think she was asking me was the specific pieces i gave so
she read the petition first since i couldnt fit all the details in petition.Now
i just have to wait and see if the gm who was off today and eont be on till
tomorrow night will reimburse them or not.The guide also tried to get the npc
to work but couldnt it.Heres to hoping the gm will replace it since they are so
hard to get the guide knows that something is wrong with npc after fooling
around trying to get it to do the quests but she wouldnt guarantee the gm would
replace it.
