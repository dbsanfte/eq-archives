I find it amazing that people could be so stupid as to expect them to buff
you while you sit around getting no xp. Unfortunately I dont have any
control over other "good samaritans" who hand out free/cheap buffs. A number
of times ive got invitations when it became clear I wasnt buffing them, even
for donations. I guess I was lucky I didnt get kicked out just after I
buffed them. Definitly one for the ignore list I'd say. Sounds like youve
had worse luck than usual. I found getting groups (and mostly good groups)
easy.
