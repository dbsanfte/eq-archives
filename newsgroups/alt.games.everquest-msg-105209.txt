This is already known, though, widely. In beta AC was displayed
as "mitigation" and "avoidance". ATK was likewise "to hit" and "to hurt",
although not under those names.

This was apparently confusing to the more simian customers, and so they
were amalgamated into a single displayed value which has precisely nothing
to do with your actual combat skills.

I wonder if the EQSnoopy types (or whatever its called... who got the
XP figures from the data and stuff) can see if the client still knows
those raw figures and displays them added... It'd be nice to be able
to extract the real figures.

However, it IS still useful for somet things: For example, deciding which
of two similarly levelled classes is likely to be the best tank, and
so forth. Not exact, but still the most useful yardstick we have beyond
"well I prefer the purple looking armour."
