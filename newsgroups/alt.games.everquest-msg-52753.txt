It is not considered an exploit at least not yet.  I know they tend to
disapprove of multi questing J-boots, but crafted is not something they
would give two hoots about.  It's entirely possible to multiquest
crafted, i helped a friend get some of his crafted i had the aviak charm
that I looted not knowing what it was for at the time, and noone else
wanted it.  I turned in the charm, then he turned in the gems and got
his gauntlets.
