I have 2 questions that I thought you guys might have an answer to.

1)  Is there a command line switch for EQGAME.EXE to bypass the Sony intro 
screen?

2)  After the latest patch, my trader seems to be getting dropped from the 
bazaar more often than usual.  Is there a way to trap what the cause was?  
Like network congestion, packet loss, ie lag?

Any help would be appreciated,

M
