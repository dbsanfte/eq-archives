Totally agree.

Wouldn't it suck if your body was lost in a dungeon, and you had no way
(group) to recover it,  then along comes a rogue or monk (with a good
ability to corpse recover)... you think your in luck, then he reminds you of
the time he needed SoW for a corpse retr, and you told him to go to hell...

Or the cleric rezzing.. or the SK locating bodies.. or the Chanter giving
C2..

Im quite sure if you ever need help with an epic battle, people will glady
offer their services... I for one have helped numerous druids with various
stages of their epic (some total strangers, some friends)

Theres a reason for /anon and /roleplay... I suggest you learn these 2
features if you prefer to be left alone.
