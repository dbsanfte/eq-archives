Just logged off of my 35 bard.  Animations were still working.  And
good lord, why are you in DL?!?  What level is your bard?  There are
many options.  I was just in GD goofing around fear-kiting tizmaks.
Easy exp.

Only time I've had my bard in DL was recently (at 35) to fear-kite /
charm-kite the Yeti caves.  And only then with OOC and Shout turned
off  :-)
