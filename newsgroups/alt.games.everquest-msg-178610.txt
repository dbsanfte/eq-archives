I believe that is incorrect.  The ogres themselves, without Chief Goonda,
will not attack if you are not KOS.  Chief Goonda is on a different faction,
and will happilly attack you, at which point, the other ogres will
apparently join in.  I speak from personal experience on the ogres not
attacking, as I have run right through them, when they were not green to me.
Chief Goonda on the other hand, was a different story.
