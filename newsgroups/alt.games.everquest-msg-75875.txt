Well for druids the perm charm of a creature in the zone is bad
because

1) it does not appear to work in the way it says it does

2) the creatures you can do that with have to be incredibly low level
making it pointless.

When i heard of this skill I envisoned at least being able to charm
say a level 30 or 35 rhino in eastern wastes which would frankly kick
much behind  (they are pretty buff and hit for good damage) However it
seems you can't even do THAT. 

I'm not sure if its bugged or what but until I hear it works better
there is no reason to invest a ton of points into it.
