OH MY GOD !

A reply to a thread he started !
OK, so he didn't quote and didn't make it clear who he was talking to.
Oh and didn't exactly write English.
And clearly failed to realise that he is considered a fool here already.
And he missed the point that he was insulting, or at the very least
rude.
But EQDB replied !

Where is that thread about hell freezing over and Bizbees lying down
with TwoHeads ?
