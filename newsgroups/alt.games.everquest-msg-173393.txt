Did you go and use your early training points in your weapon skill?

Do it. The difference is gigantic. I have started a bunch of lowbies
in my time. Sometimes I forget to do that (in a few cases I couldn't
even find my trainer :-p ). The fights at L1 and 2 were insanely hard;
mobs were dinging off me instead of the other way around.

But the characters I dumped all my points into 1hs or piercing or
whatever... they could *hit* the mobs they fought. And the mobs would
die fast.

You won't miss eight or ten training points later on. Use em right
away.
