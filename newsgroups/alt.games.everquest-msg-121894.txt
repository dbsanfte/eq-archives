I understand the attitude, but as somebody pointed out in another
thread some time ago, the real problem is that the only thing worse
than being LFG in DL is actually joining a pickup group there.
There're plenty of mobs and lots of places to base that aren't at
all likely to be trained, so if you put together your group before
you go there (and maybe turn off ooc and shout) it can actually be
a pretty good place for an xp hunt.

Dunno about soloing a druid, haven't played a druid past 15, but if
you're not dead set on soloing there're lots of places you can hunt
very successfully if you pick up a clueful melee partner.  I end up
soloing a lot, because RL forces me AFK frequently much of the time
I play, but when I've got some uninterrupted time my absolute favorite
partner with Paladin or Warrior is, and has always been, a druid.
