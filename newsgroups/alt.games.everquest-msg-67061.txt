  Maybe because they usually do?  Recently they haven't been, but
that's because some people are still suffering serious issues and it's
better "customer service" for them to release the crucial patches as
they become available, even if that means only giving one or two days
notice on the patch.  Of course, the best "customer service" would
have been to more thoroughly test the engine/expansion before
releasing them in the first place, so I won't disagree with anybody
who says that Verant customer service is sorely lacking.  Though I do
disagree with some of your reasons for saying so.

  I would hazard a guess that the reason your post was removed was
because you posted it under the "Tech Support" forum which is not
intended as a forum for feedback and criticism.  That is what
eqfeedback@soe.sony.com is for.  Granted, it's not an open forum where
people can read your criticism and laud you or flame you for your
thoughts, but it should get to the appropriate people at Verant.  If
you want an open forum where you can make your criticisms and be
lauded or [more likely] flamed for them, welcome to
alt.games.everquest.
