If/when it succeeds, Taunt sets your hate to (top of list hate value)+1.

Taunt is unlike most other ways that the hate list is modified.  The
only other oddball hate list modifier I can think of is removal from
the list via Atone/Memblur/Mez(sometimes)/FD(sometimes).  The theory
I've seen that matches my results is that Taunt is pure pass/fail, with
mob level, Taunt skill, and your hate relative to the top-of-list hate
affecting your chance of success.  Were Taunt incremental I could not
occasionally gain agro vs. characters who have far more hate than I do.
Were success not influenced by relative hate vs. top-of-list I would
succeed in taunting just as often when way behind in hate as I do when
I am close.  Were Taunt not affected by mob level (or a resist that
higher level mobs usually have a high value in) I could Taunt higher
level mobs as easily as I can low level mobs.  I've been Taunting mobs
in EQ for 3.5 years, before I encountered that theory it was unclear
when to Taunt and what sort of success to expect from it.  Since then
the only new understanding required to predict/explain my results has
been about situational modifiers to agro like proximity, sitting, low
health, and root (best not to think of them as modifiers to the hate
list, there are times it is useful to Taunt even when you already have
agro because you are not top-of-the-list, once you are top-of-the-list
Taunting does nothing but grey out the button for 5 seconds).
