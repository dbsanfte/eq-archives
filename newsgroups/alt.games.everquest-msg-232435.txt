This happened on the Rathe today.  While going through GD on my way to SG
(via PoM), a guild was setting up for the ring war.  A few minutes later
while my group was killing swordfish, a guy said in /ooc that he had ended
up in SG when he tried to zone into Icewell.  I found out later that the
guild had lost the war, as there were nothing but "gutted guards" and
"bludgeoned bankers" in Thurg.  So is that phenomenon a bug or working as
intended, and if it's working as intended... why?
