Hi,

I have a quick question...

Say that my character casts a damage absorbing spell on himself
(in this case the Wizard spell Steel Skin).  When he gets hit by
something nasty which cons blue to him, does he still have a chance
of seeing his defense skills increase... even if the damage dealt
by the attacking creature is completely absorbed by the spell?

(assuming of course that his defense skill is not already maxed
out for his level, that is..)

Does anyone know if this can occur?

I would think that it is possible to see a skill increase in this
case.. I just have never seen it happen yet.

Just wondering.

Best Regards,

 - Mike Dorr
