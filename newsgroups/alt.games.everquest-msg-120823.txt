First off, let me say that I fully believe casters were in need of
balancing, particularly in the post 50 game, and that improvements to
casters are improvements to our raiding force. 

But seriously, the items they've chosen to put these effects on are
simply ridiculous.

We've already got casters bagging their shawls in favour of ODS. Level 3
on ODS, and level 2 on a no mana, no wis range item from nToV? 

Everyone is snapping up RMBs like there's no tomorrow. Bandit rings and
cougar claws, I mean, come on....

And where they put HealingIII, talk about deliberately stirring the
endgame pot by piling on the high end confrontations LOL

Certain caster slots now have the best items in the game on droppable
newbie gear. Hell, my L11 pally CHA mule is wearing a RMB I couldn't get
rid of, and I'm being begged for it by the best equipped casters in my
guild.

Course, it's conceivable that they've put them on commonly available
items to get a much wider sample set for future tweaking, but that's
going down the nerf route, and any changes *will* be viewed as nerfs.

The only way I can see this being a fully though-out process is for
higher end gear to be given new focuses with stronger effects, but
unless that happens, certain slots are pretty much irreplaceable for
casters.

Wizard tells the guild, 'Let it rot - we've got our DamageIII necklaces
and we ain't replacing them.'
