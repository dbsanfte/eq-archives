Yeah,  unfortunately having to group with strangers can be the kiss of
death.  You were lucky in that you knew it was a lost cause and bailed out
when it got messy... but sometimes even if you think the group can handle it
and people don't play their part correctly, it can get messy.  This is worse
because you don't realize it until after at least one group massacre.

Oh well, a few more names to add to the "not gonna group with them" list
