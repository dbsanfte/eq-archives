Even if I maxed out all other AA skills (which I doubt I'll ever do) I still
wouldn't get those.. I wonder if *anybody* has picked those 2 AA skills

I know I got bored of AA skills long before I got my sensei title (last
title).. and between raiding, and regular exping (don't wanna lose level
60!) I don't want to totally burn out on my monk.

A guildie cleric got to 105 AA levels before she decided to stop, and as a
result in the last month has hardly played her cleric.. can we say burnout!
