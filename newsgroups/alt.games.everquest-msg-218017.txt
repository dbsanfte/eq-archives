Hate to be the one to inform you - but you can't get melee skill ups
in a duel - only by fighting NPC's of some kind - you can however get
a pet class, who's pet cons DARK BLUE or higher to duel you - he can
call the pet off if it gets too close - and you will get skill ups
that way. Got my Enchie's Defense skill up by using my wife's shammy
pet in duels, I can just imagine the pet thinking "WTF - my master is
healing the one I am fighting. Oh Well, to live is to serve."

=)

Hope this helps.
