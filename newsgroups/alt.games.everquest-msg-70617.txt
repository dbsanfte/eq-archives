  They didn't give actual URLs.  Sorry, you contribute nothing to the
discussion by supplying completely invalid figures that you don't
bother to make any real effort to verify.  As somebody who had to
purchase Windows 98 upgrade and didn't want to pay more than was
necessary and as somebody who is web savvy and computer savvy enough
to do a fair amount of searching, you'll just have to take my word for
it.  If you want to upgrade from Win95 to Win98 or Me from a reputable
dealer and get it in a fair amount of time, you're going to spend at
least $60, probably closer to $70-90.
