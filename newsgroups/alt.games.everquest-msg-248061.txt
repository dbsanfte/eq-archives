Honor...   "I'm the lead pulling monk.  I'm doing this for the good of the
guild." ...is subjective.  Not coincidentally, people tend to err in their
own favor.

And I wear only two or three items that are droppable.  Working on replacing
one of those as soon as possible too, but people keep bidding high on
earrings.  =)  I haven't had much in the way of droppable gear since the
early 50s (no joke, about half of my monk's experience since level 50 has
been gained on raids...  I never did care for grinding much).
