Well, we aren't totally in the dark, since the total is still
available.

EQ right now:   98352
DAoC right now: 32699

I think Verant was telling the truth when they said the reason they
took away the numbers was to avoid giving competitors too much
information.  For example, if Mythic had the EQ per server totals,
they could compare the population drop on PvP servers with the
population drop on PvE servers, and figure out if they need to put
more emphasis on the RvR stuff, or beef up the PvE stuff, to better
attract EQ players.

The big thing, though, was the various "/who count" commands.  That
would give Mythic (and others) a lot of information.  They would be
able to figure out if the people willing to leave EQ to try another
game are bored high level people, or if they tend to be particular
classes, etc.
