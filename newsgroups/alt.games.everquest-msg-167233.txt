Well, depends in part on his age too.  Around 40 or so, you start losing the
ability to focus on as wide a range of distances.

As for the resoluton causing headaches, there are two possible issues there.
One is the refresh rate, typically that goes down as the resolution goes up.
If the refresh rate gets below 72Hz or so, it can cause headaches with
prolonged use.  The other is just the size of text and such that you are
trying to focus on, and if your vision is not that great, or not corrected
properly for the viewing distance in question, then that can also cause
headaches from the strain.
