Actually, capitalism does not require money.  Barter is capitalism,
just without money.  The true meaning of capitalism is 

: an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market 

no mention of currency.  "prices" does not equate to currency.
