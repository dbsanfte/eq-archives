Decently equipped?  My Paladin, supposedly a defensive tank second
only to the Warrior, reached 900 AC unbuffed for the first time at
level 51 (or was it 52?).  It was not until I managed to start making
decent pp with a bazaar trader that I was able reach 1000ac (sad that
I can't do that in-game, but if you can't block out the time for
raiding you're just SOL in this game).  If a "decently equipped" 47
Monk has 900 AC this stupid game is even more broken than I thought
it was.
