Urm, shadowed men don't have "nice" drops. No rent weapons, ro quest 
items, a component you need too make DE cultural armor, and a few gp and 
the odd plat. That said I like to hunt them in L'fay myself (because the 
zone is so quiet), when I find myself in need of something they drop. 
Wolf form is helpful for avoiding the brownie scourge. Other camps are 
in WC, SK, LS, and Inothule Swamp.
