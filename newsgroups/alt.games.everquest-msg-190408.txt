Sounds interesting, I've seen "a prisoner" on my tracking in WFP but I've
yet to find where they are.  Perhaps I should make another trip down there
just to finally figure out exactly where the prisoner is.   He may have been
talking to someone else when it said ' a prisoner hands you something '
that may explain why you didn't get anything in your inventory.
