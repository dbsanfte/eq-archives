EQ2 is set 500 years into the future, Hobbits have an average life
expectancy of 110, but can reach 150. Assuming male Hobbits remain fertile
until death, it is possible that the EQ character be only 4-5 generations
removed from the EQ2 character.

But, it is an RPG, so your particular family may have genes that tend
towards an unusually long life, or some other tale - Gollum's lifespan was
almost 600 year due to the effects of the ring.

Or you could come from a family of runts that don't last more than 30 years
or so, and have a few hundred generations between characters.

In other words, it's whatever YOU decide it is.
