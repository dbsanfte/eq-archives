Wolf form?
A guildie messed up his corrupter stage and redid it without any
problems. And I'd hosed my faction enough through other means that Giz
wouldn't speak to me without wolf form when I did the hand in myself
(though, is he actually higher than dubious to druids who haven't
gotten a ton of dark elf faction hits?)
Yes, it's not fun to have to run letters across a couple zones so you
can do it again, but it's not exactly like KSing old style Ragefire,
is it?
