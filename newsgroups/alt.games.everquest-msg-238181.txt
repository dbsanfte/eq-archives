The OP hasn't shown up on my news server yet, so I'll reply to this reply.
The only effective way to raise Venril Sathir faction, the outpost faction
and the one you need to get the hammer, is to kill Sarnak Berzerkers in OT
and turn in the War Braids.  The faction hit for killing berzerkers is a
small one, but you are going to need to turn in a lot of braids to get your
faction up for the hammer.  Your other option is to get Puppet Strings
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=11643 , which would allow you to
charm the hammer quest guy to complete the quest reguardless of your
faction.

Sarnak faction is a bit of a pain (read: tedious, bothersome, and a test of
endurance) to raise since the revamp or Nurga/Dooga.  You are going to have
to kill many many goblins or ChardokB mobs to get your faction up.  If you
want to do both the old fashioned way.  Get the VS faction first and then
start farming Sarnak faction.  Best of luck.
