Sometimes failed begging cause aggro from NPCs (and some NPCs attack 
immediately after begging, Guard Fayfear in Gfay HATE beggers), but im 
pretty sure that begging dont cause aggro in mobs.

I need oak bark for my tailoring, and sit in Kith once in a while to 
forage. When doing that im bored, and snare a bixie to get it to attack 
me, so i can beg from it. And after around 30 min the bixie simply gets 
bored and leave, so me begging it every time i can does not cause aggro.
Might be because im so much higher, cant say for sure, but at least in 
that case, begging dont do anything.
