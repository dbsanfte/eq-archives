Good grief.  I had no idea.

Shit.  Several people.  I've given other people my password in the past.
I hadn't been reading or posting to this newsgroup in months, and so I
never saw the threads that talked about usernames and passwords, and
stolen accounts.  I honestly never thought that it would be so easy to
guess a password, if you knew the station ID.

I'm becoming paranoid here.  There's no way to change your station ID
name either, is there.

I've changed my password to something completely random now.  I guess
the only thing to do is wait and see if someone hacks it again.
