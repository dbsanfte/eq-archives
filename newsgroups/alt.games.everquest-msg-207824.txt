Everyone eventually has a story about the hell camp that lasted forever.
Between epics, vp and vt keys and other time sinks in the game everyone
hits the bad luck streaks that give them a week of hell. And, of course,
someone always has their story of getting the same spawn on the first or
second cycle. I'll spare you mine. :)

I got 2 of my 4 just from chatting up soloers in the zone, offering
buffs and rezzes. On my server, at least, soloers will call out drops to
the zone or send you a tell if you get friendly with them.

>Heh - I could never get 175 people in there killing.

I used my dual boxed warrior, probably one of the first times since PoP
came out that I've got my money's worth on my second account.
