Hi Fooboy;

No...I didn't "ebay" my character. In fact I have a 15 druid, 16 shammy and
a 9 necro. These I soloed with and didn't group. It wasn't until I started a
cleric that I "found" my place in EQ. The problem I have is learning and
keeping up with the various classes as I gain levels. Sadly, I only hunted
in a few places doing several levels in each place and have not developed a
well rounded understanding of how all things work in EQ. As I move to
another area to play and level, I meet higher classes to play with. These
classes (as you know) also get new skills and can do different things than
when I was playing with them 10 or 15 levels lower. I still have a hard time
looking at a character and knowing exactly what that character is. When I do
a /who many are anonymous or have titles (which I'm still trying to learn).
As I group with the various classes, I see so many combinations, each
playing their character in a different way that in my mind, I can't get a
firm grip what combination I should suggest when I wind up in a group that
is clueless as to who does what and when. That's why I asked the NG here for
help.

Thanks for your time in answering.

Doctorzoid
