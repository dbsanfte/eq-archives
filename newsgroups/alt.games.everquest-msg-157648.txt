Your guild is a raiding guild - which is exactly what you wanted.
Therefore, they raid - a bunch, I'm sure. I'm a firm believer in the
chain of command. The guild leaders set policy and make the
"battlefield" decisions. They should not have to justify them every
time they turn around, especially when the decisions support the guild
directives. You should consider yourself lucky if this doesn't
adversely affect your standing.

I can also certainly understand your excitement about the new content.
Rest assured though, it will be there when you get around to checking
it out.
