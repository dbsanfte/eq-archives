In most cases, this designation doesn't matter.  You'll often see
better stats on magic items than on similar non-magic ones,
but there's no guarantee of that.

Three items, though, you will find it is important to note if they
are magical.

There are certain mobs out there that can only be hit by
magic weapons.  Most well known of these is the Will o Wisp,
but there are others.

Thus, a weapon which is a MAGIC ITEM can hit these while
others, even ones that seem vastly superior, cannot.

Many of the melee classes have a Kick skill... this uses the
feet, but cannot hit without MAGIC ITEM boots

All classes also have Hand to Hand combat capability,
meaning they can punch things if they have no weapon
in hand.  For the most part, only monks, who have a
significant bonus here, do so...  but at any rate, punching
also doesn't hit those critters unless you are wearing
MAGIC ITEM gloves.  (Monks at high levels attain the
ability to hit magic without gloves, I think although the
odds of them wanting to do so aren't very good)
