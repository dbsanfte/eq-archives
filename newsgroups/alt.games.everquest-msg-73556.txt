Her gear is actually up to par but, some changes I would make...
I would get the +4 int + 2 strength sapphire earrings, yes I know it drops
int by 2 points but my mage is so weak that the extra 4 strength is nice.
Neck slot I would get Velium Sapphire necklace 8 int 8 strength
Shardwurms drop some leggings that give +2 int and the eye which gives + 5
int.
But once she gets planar and goes on a couple fear raids she will be fine.
