Playing a cleric who's best friend in the game was playing a
druid, I tried a LOT of plans to make this work, and you've hit
the nail on the head; the duo isn't very good compared to druid
soloing unless you start charm killing.  On the bright side, its
much better than cleric soloing.

Charm killing the combo rocks; high level druid pets have a lot
of HP, so the difference between pathetic druid Cheal and cleric
Cheal is finally noticable, in fact its here that I miss the
10,000 point cleric Cheal  (which still won't heal a blood raven
completely).  Plus the cleric can handle the root chores and more
importantly can chain stun escaped pets till charm resticks;
broken charm is responsible for a lot of druid death or at best
wasted druid time in running and trying to charm again and
again.  With the stuns the mob just stands there till charmed
again, and then the last stun wears off in under 6 seconds and
you are off to the races again.  Plus the cleric can use MOR to
boost the DS side of things a bit more without wasting too much
damage, and use the fast heals on the druid who tends to get
dinged up a bit, freeing the druid to concentrate on his charm
kiting.  I wouldn't say a cleric comes close to more than
doubling the druid's kill rate, but he does make it a good deal
safer and smoother and comes closer using this method than any
other; meanwhile the druid is unquestionable more than
quadrupling the cleric's solo kill rate.

You are looking at this wrong, its not "is it better than other
duo's" its "is it better than the two soloing side by side."

Any way you look at it, the answer is going to be yes, there's
nothing one cleric can do that a second cleric won't help a -lot-
with.
