I was on my first Behemoth kill a couple of days ago, after weeks of
watching all my guildmates cruise around PoTactics.  When we were all
gathered, I asked what the strategy was.  "We Zerg it," I was told.  Who's
the MT?  "Whoever gets aggro."  What do I have to do?  "Heal everyone who
gets hurt."

The only "strategy" I was given was to load group heals and don't bother
conserving mana.  So I did; I just kept chain-casting Ethereal Elixir and
Word of Redemption (my best group heal spell, alas) until Behemoth died.
Ours was the only group where everyone lived.

Alas, my group was wiped later on when everyone logged on their alts and
trained the door mobs to us in an effort to get flagged.  Two door mobs we
can handle; the seven spider aggros were a bit much.  If they'd just been a
bit more patient, we would have moved the flag-giving NPC to the door.
That's in fact what we ended up doing after the rezzes.  There was much
swearing in our raid channel about the intelligence of some of our alliance
members.  =)

I was just amazed that, as this level, there's a mob we just don't have a
coherent strategy for.  But then again, seeing how quickly he dropped, it
doesn't look like you need one.   =)
