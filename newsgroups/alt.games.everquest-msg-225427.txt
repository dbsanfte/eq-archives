The fact that a fix isn't out the door immediately doesn't mean it's
not being addressed. And clearly "many other people" isn't all that
many. I've only seen 3 or 4 people mention this in all the EQ forums I
visit, and nobody in either of my guilds has mentioned it. So, it
would seem that the segment of the player base effected by this is
small enough that they're not putting an emergency rush on it. Doesn't
mean it's being ignored, though.

Meanwhile, email them bug reports through their site with DXDiag
reports. The info could prove helpful to them in getting this
situation cleared up.
