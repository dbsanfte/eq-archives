For a WinXP or Win2k machine either the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz (5
channel  surround) or cheaper Hercules Fortissimo II (4 channel
surround) work nicely. I've had the Fort II for about 6 months now and
like it. Not as much as my Aureal SQ2500....but thanks to Creative it
never had decent drivers written for 2k/XP and I just couldn't bear
having Win98 on my machine any longer.  /rude Creative Labs
