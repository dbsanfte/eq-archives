Riiiight.

Personally, I want a page to DISPLAY INFORMATION and MAKE SENSE. If I want 
to marvel over someone's choice of HTML elements, I will view the source.

Well, then, simply telnet to port 80 of whatever site you want to see and

Code is meant to do something, how it does it is peripheral unless you are 
into obfuscation or Perl poetry.

I imagine your stove is an end unto itself as well- the fact that it cooks food is 
peripheral.
