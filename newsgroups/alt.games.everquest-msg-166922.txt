They don't suck, I'm just not having any luck passing them.

What was an interesting challenge initially is now past ridiculous, as I'm at
over 100 attempts no successes.  Given that the average attempt runs half an
hour (factoring in wait times, of course, in a no wait environment the average
failed attemp takes around 15 minutes including medding back up to go again)
this is fifty hours in one camp... if it weren't for the fact that this is a
bottleneck preventing me from getting to 70% of PoP content, I'd have long
since given it up as a bad job.

If there's an alternative to them, or if they are slightly easier with the
change, then I'm going to be glad to hear it.

If, as some have suggested without explaination, there's a way thru the trials
that isn't based on an optimized high DPS group, I'd like to hear that
explained.
