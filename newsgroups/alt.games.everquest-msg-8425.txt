I am getting ready to move into an area that I will be able to subscibe to a
cable modem.  I have lived with 56k until now and I get teary eyed just
thinking about it.  My current set up involves 2 computers networked with a
5-port Linksys 10/100 hub.  I purchased this setup as part of a
Homenetworking kit and it came with 2 ethernet cards.   This is simply the
best EQ setup I could imagine.  I am using internet connection sharing under
WinME and I am able to play EQ on my fastest computer while surfing EQ atlas
and other sites (e.g. porn) on the other.

My question is this.  Will I need to purchase a ~$150 router when I get the
cable modem in order to continue my same setup?  Or will I be able to plug
the Roadrunner modem into my hub or maybe my fastest computer and still
network the way I do?  Also, should I be concerned with not mentioning to
the "cable guy" that I plan on doing this so that I do not incur other
"charges"?

Thanks Guys,
