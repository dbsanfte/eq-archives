Oddly enough I don't see this.  Well, to clarify I very rarely see this.  
On occasion I have tried to track to a person and completely missed them, 
but it seems to be very rare now.

I track players in my group all the time.  When pulling I find it easiest 
to track to the mob, then track back to the group.  This is especially 
useful when I'm pulling while the group moves to the pull spot.  
Maybe it's working for bards and broken for Rangers.  Our tracking is 
much, much weaker than ranger tracking.  Well, except for tracking 
groupmembers, which works across the entire zone.
(And yes, I have tracked moving groupmembers across a zone as recently as 
last week.  Hmmmm, thinking about it I also tracked a non-group member 
the same night, but had to be pretty close to even see his name on my 
list.)
