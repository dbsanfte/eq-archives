If you can figure out which GM or Guide ran the event, ask them.
Roleplay it, if possible. If you treat them as the god's avatar or
voice on norrath, maybe you can draw something out of it. 
I have had GM/Guide intervention 3 times. 2 times all went very well,
1 was disappointing (That's a known bug, so I can't help you??) and I
have roleplayed each one as a request of the gods. It amused them, and
I suspect helped me some.

Your reputation with GM's has increased.
