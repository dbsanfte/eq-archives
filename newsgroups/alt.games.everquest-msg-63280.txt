Proximity appears to be a factor in hammer suicide.  While camping
Lord Grimblox, I played around with the hammer a lot, at first as a
crucial tool to soloing the spawn, once I got high level help, just as
a toy.  What I observed is that if I could keep my distance from the
hammer, it wouldn't kill itself, but rather keep trying to return to
me.  I kept one alive thru two full loops of the circuit around the king
room and thru the secret door, before finally finding something
else that popped and aggroed on me.  Most often I'd fail to
get aggro before it would catch me, despite having an evade
capable rogue and a FD capable monk, it took too long
for the mobs to turn and go for me, and the hammer was too
hot on my tail, it would kill itself just before I got hit.

I have high hopes, though, for lowbie dungeon romps with
TBoot effect on, sometime soon I'm going to try and kill everything
in Crushbone with it in one grand swoop.  As long as I can keep
ahead of it while tapping more orcs on the shoulder to aggro them
I should be golden!
