/split does split evenly, by coin type.  You didn't say what the coinage you
were splitting was, but from what you said above you were presumably
splitting 167 Plat plus assorted GSP.  It will split each coin type evenly,
with leftovers going to the splitter.  Thus 164, everybody gets 41.  165,
everybody gets 41, you get 42.  So on and so forth.

Lately I've been trying to make sure that I'm ML.  I know I can trust me.
On the flip side, I've had one ML decide to skip with all the loot, had an
ML declare "NBG, and I need the Str+4 augment more than anybody else does"
(immediately after looting it, of course), and various other problems.  Had
one person last night say that having a Necro (low Cha) doing the selling
isn't the best thing, so I asked why 146 Cha is considered low.  2 Cha+25
steins do a world of good.
