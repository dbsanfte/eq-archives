Errr. Last I knew the full group bonus was 30%, so let's do the math...

Imagine you have 100 xp for a given mob and are all of the same level. Then
you wind up with 20 each. Adding a sixth makes it 100 * 1.3 = 130 / 6 = 22
or so xp ea. Adding a 6th Adds to xp, I've seen it many times.

Now, where I have to agree is: 1. The "bonus" is not exactly overwhelming.
2. When you're at 4, getting any more if you don't need them is a net loss
(but is still the courteous thing to do in a hugely overcamped zone like
PC).
