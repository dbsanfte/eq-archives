Well, much of the high end game is an unplayable, un-fun mess, and the
top players have been telling them how to fix it for a long time.
Ignoring the general population makes sense, but ignoring the people
who know the most about how the game actually works makes no sense.

See Tigole's long post on the front page of www.legacyofsteel.net for
a good explanation of the high end EQ problems and many suggestions
for fixes.
