Since fun is subjective he can't prove it to your satisfaction, only
to his.  Some people like getting kicked in the nuts for example. 
The fact is if a person knows what he is getting into, knows he could
die, knows he could kill, knows he could be outnumbered and still
chooses to do it there must be a reason for their doing it. My guess
is they think it's fun.
