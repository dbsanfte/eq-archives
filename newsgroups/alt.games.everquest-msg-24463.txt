Hmm... I don't know that investing 3k into JC is such a good idea. You
aren't going to actually make money to pay off your investment until you
start making velium items, plat possibly (most people want velium items,
I see people selling them for near the exact same price we used to sell
plat items for; the price people are willing to pay for plat items is
way too low these days). And you are not going to get to the point where
you can make those items on 3k, nevermind the fact that you won't be
able to make the items until you are level 34-44. 

With 7k to spend, you should concentrate on one thing: getting your int
AND cha to 200.
