20 assistant healers?? Um...no, not for us. 1-3 druids per raid
maximum and 1-2 shamans. Think at our last Vindi kill we had 5
clerics, 4 on the cheal rotation and 1 to heal rampage victims, 2
druids and 2 shamans.

How many people show up at your raids? We tend to get 30-50. Think we
had 29 on our last Doz kill but don't quote me on that. We don't do
zerg tactics.
