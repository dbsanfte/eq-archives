Actually that is not the problem. After the hybrid XP change I started
a troll sk and they actually level quite fast, even soloing.

The problem I had was that once reaching level 30, when the regen
becomes more moot, I wished I instead was an ogre. The ogre can start
with MUCH heftier stamina, while still having good stats, and is non
stunnable from the front with regular melee blows.

The troll penalty is 20 percent while the ogre's is 15. This is not
enough to really make a difference. For me it was just that once you
get that 45 hp or whatever super good lifetap at 30 or so, the racial
regen seems kind of moot yet you continue to pay for it. What the ogre
comes with is always good.
