   Why is that a good reason?  It's not like the dark
elves themselves tortured the king and queen or anything
(and I thought it was for "only" a hundred years).
That's sort of like hating a baby because its father
raped its mother, seems to me.  Now, I could see the
High elves getting all huffy because the DE's tend to 
worship the god that did this.
