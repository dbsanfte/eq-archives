You've got a valid point there. But if the bazaar is why im paying 30% more
per month I'd like to see them fix the problem (see below) not perpetrate
this fiasco for years on end...

I personally couldn't beleive they set it up that way... bandwidth issues
aside. Why we couldn't simply transfer our stuff to a special 'npc via a
bank type interface', and add the feature to set prices... and walk away/log
out whatever. Requiring the character to stand around in the bazaar was just
lame.
