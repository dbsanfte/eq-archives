A bit annoying, but at higher levels, with decent slow, getting a new
root through isn't too hard, and once you get your dog you can use it
to keep the mob distracted. Though 40-43 I usually tanked for my pet
so I could get my defense up, keeping slow and a few DoTs on the mob.

Also, fighting low to mid dark blues, root doesn't break too often
once you get to the mid 30s.

Healing is a pain, with the tiny little heal for 300 you get stuck
with from 29 to 51. Slow does a lot to help, though, once mobs start
doing enough damage (in the 30s).

Usually not long enough (assuming you're in a group with decent damage
output). Even on a fresh twink-less server where people have crap
weapons and crap armour, I seemed to spend less mana just healing than
trying to slow.

Still not worth it, or at least that's how it seemed to me. I never
actually parsed anything.

Cannibalize plus regen plus Iksar regen rocks, though doing the canni
dance optimally is tricky, because the HP/mana updates you see lie -
stand up and canni as soon as you see them change and watch yourself
lose 50hp and effectively gain no mana (because you lose a tick of
meditation).

Shaman animal charms can't charm high level mobs - the limit is at 34
or thereabouts, IIRC, or maybe 29.

Definitely worth it if you can spare the mana, i.e. always if you're
not the main healer.

Well, I grouped mostly until 38, so no tanking. But yes, slow (even if
it's a waste of mana, because it makes people feel better and you
don't need to argue), heal (not so much if you have a cleric, though
you should always keep regen up on the tank), poison DoTs, and
buffs. Root for crowd control. Maybe debuffs, though I don't think
they're mana efficient, I just used them when I had spare mana and
someone else to heal (because trying to coordinate heals is hard).
