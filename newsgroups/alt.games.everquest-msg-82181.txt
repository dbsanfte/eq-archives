Thanks for the reply, Dark.  Yes, I just checked, he is a bandit.  I suffered
through the battle a second time, as I read the /log.    :o)

[Fri Jan 25 18:25:02 2002] Gundl bashes YOU for 12 points of damage.

In looking at this I see I need to correct what I wrote earlier.  I did not miss

with my axe 28 times and never hit him.  I missed 28 times and connected
*once.*  That was for one point, while half the time I land blows with that
it is for 28 or 29 points, and blows land more often than they miss.  I am
still totally stumped as to why I couldn't hurt that little monster.

I appreciate it.  I was looking over my RL dad's shoulder as he played one day,
back around the holidays.  He jumped into a lake in West Commonlands and
met up with Dragoon Xytl underwater, as well as a pet of his.  Shortly after, I
watched my dad loot his corpse.  Thanks for the warning.

That's okay.  Please let me know, if anyone else has a hint.

Sloppybutfast

Uh-oh.  I said 'please' and 'thank you' both in the same post.  I hope I am
still welcome in this ng.         ;o)
