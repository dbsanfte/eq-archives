I'm guessing the item goes into the same spot in the vendors inventory but 
the number of charges is set by whatever he's sold first - when he is sold 
a second one, the number of those items that he has in stock is just 
incremented, its not treated like a new item.

So in your example above, you would sell the 8 charge one, then the one 
that's run out of charges, and buy back two staves with 8 charges each. I 
imagine the buyback value on a Vox staff is particularly horrendous though.
