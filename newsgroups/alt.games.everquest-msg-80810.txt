I know of a couple NPCs that will cure disease in exchange for
money/items--Mystic Dovan in Swamp of No Hope (in exchange for a giant
blood sac) and Priestess Caulria in Qeynos cleric guild (in exchange
for a rabid wolf pelt), plus I remember reading here about another NPC
that would cure disease in exchange for 5 gold (I don't remember what
zone he was in).  Is there a list anywhere of other NPCs that can cure
disease and the zones they are in?  (this would be handy for someone
who can't find a healer type player to cure disease for them)

Thanks in advance,
