Oh, thats ideal. Many thanks ;) It'd take a lot for me to move server
really... I kind of think I'd quit EQ if it got to the stage I really
felt no ties to my current residence, but... shrug. Its always interesting
to see and... EQ has never had the 'shine' it used to since I left
my original family guild and went upt he ladder some. The further I went
the less shiny it got and now... shrug. So little there ;)
