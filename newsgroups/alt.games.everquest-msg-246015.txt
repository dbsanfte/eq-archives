sounds like the kind of war that can, and occasionally is, spawned by player
actions - there is one that occurs in Jagged Pine when one or more
particular gnoll Mobs are slain - the gnolls attack the outpost at the zone
in point, leaving dead bodies of those normally in those buildings.  Details
available on Alakazam, read up on it after the fact.

Was kinda funny, I solo there a lot, zoned back in another section, killed
some things, went back to drop some items at bank, noticed bodies on the
way, ooc'd a rude comment to whatever 'evil' player was killing the people
there, went up to the banked and clicked on him, and only then noticed he
was a gnoll conning dark blue, as we the other four creatures in the room.

They didn't seem to want to do business with a wood elf ranger of Tunare.

SOW don't fail me now!
