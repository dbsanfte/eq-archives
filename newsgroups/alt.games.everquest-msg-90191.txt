Personally I LOVE being gung ho as an enchanter. I've had nothing but
compliments when I start pulling and 'parking' the mobs for the next kill...
I've always believed that a Melee that never stops swinging is a happly
melee... never had many problems with Spongers myself... and occasional afk
and what not but if you in my group you best be busy... I don't think I'd
hesitate to drop a sponge personally
