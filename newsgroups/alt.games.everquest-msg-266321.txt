Sorry that I removed snare and you got eaten.  It wouldn't happen if you

If you put him on /ignore immediately, you don't see these OOCs.  The actual
disruptive actions (which you are correct about, a GM will warn/punish him
if you can find one, but that's somewhat rare).

/guildstatus works even for anon people.  Not that it helps much.

That's the basic choice.  Petition early, and if there's no response, you
mostly have to decide whether to fight back or to just leave.  Unless you
enjoy the fight itself, leaving is usually the better option.  It sucks, but
he's likely to enjoy the shouting, training, and complaining, while you just
feel dirty.
