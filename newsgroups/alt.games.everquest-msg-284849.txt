You might want to add a definition for the term "riposte" as it applies to 
EQ. I looked through all the sections of the FAQ and found a couple of 
instances where the term is used, but none where it is being defined.

What are the particulars of the EQ riposte, anyway? Is all damage from that 
swing reversed? Part of it? If only part of it, how much?

On a sort of related note, I'd like some clarification on rampage - 
specifically the rampage list. From reading the FAQ, I would assume that 
the puller is pretty much always the first on the rampage list, as they are 
the first to aggro the mob, correct? 

Does FD or Fade affect that? 

It would seem that a good practice would be for the MT to be the next to 
aggro the mob (after the puller, if they are not the same), then the ST 
should step up and draw aggro somehow (perhaps by having the MT step back 
momentarily?), placing themself next on the rampage list, then immediately 
letting the MT gain it back. I've not necessarily heard of that tactic 
being used and was just wondering if that was possibly the way it was done.
