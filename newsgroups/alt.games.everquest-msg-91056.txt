Just finished an hour in a very fine group.  Myself, 3 60 bards, 57 BL, 
and a 60 cleric.  Never seen mobs die that fast before, certainly not when 
the bards left and we morphed into a normal powergroup (warr, 2 rogue, me, 
cleric shammy).
It wasn't just that we were killing fast, or that we had so much bardspam 
that we could't read /groupsay, it was how much fun it was.  I'm again 
thinking of a 6 bard group.
