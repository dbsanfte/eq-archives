I can see how that would be. I, for one, played from Beta 2 until about 2 
years ago (right before SoL came out) and just came back. It's like 
speaking a different language now with AA and all the new SoL and PoP 
(and now LoY) zones and equipment and I used to be one of the "uber" 
level 60s that was involved in a lot of server firsts in NTOV and places 
like that.
