I just hit 63... and realized that there was no reason for me to
do so.

I don't have a single 63 (or 64) spell, nor have I ever seen a
single spectral parchment drop.  My gear isn't really all that,
the only stat I have thats ever hit the 265 cap of level 62 is
Dex  (I know, you thought I'd say Wis) so the higher caps aren't
really an issue either.  If I got more HP it wasn't noticable,
certainly my attack didn't go up a jot.

What DID happen was that more mobs turned green, more turned
cyan, and due to the new exp system involving high level mobs,
even the fact that mobs that were once yellow no longer are is
going to be a major blow.

I thought I'd level up to 65, then work on AA and on some of the
new quests and so forth... but I'm beginning to think I was a
fool for doing so!
