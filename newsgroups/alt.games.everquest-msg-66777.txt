Im running eq and kurnark.  Could run velious but just havent picked it up
yet and Im on a p233 128meg and a voodoo bansee card and its running fine.
I zone longer but who doesnt now.  Everyone does.  I did notice that when
its the busiest time of the game, I dont play as well.  I seem to crash to
desktop when I zone atleast once and I also notice that each time I zone it
gets longer and longer.  Its weird.  Anyways, your computer is the bare
bones requirement to run eq, kunark or velious.  But now you must remember,
you need win 98 and directx 8.1.  Be sure to have those or you wont be
playing at all.  EQ does not support win 95 anymore.  Hope this helps you.
Good luck.
