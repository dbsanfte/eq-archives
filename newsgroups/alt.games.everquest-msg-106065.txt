Now this one is very very true. And you can test it easily.
First go OOM. and sit in Pool AKA hottub of magic mana regen
Second have Artic crabs in top left slot.
Third have Ginesh, other strong drink may work, in top right slot.
Wait until you have one blue bubble of mana.
Then force feed crab. Then drink your drinks and watch your blue bar ZOOM to
