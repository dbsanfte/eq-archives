Really, LDoN just isn't for everyone.  My BF and I are usually quite happy
playing as a team.  I'm quickly becoming disillussioned with the "pickup group
circle jerk".  Patience is a requirement:  
1. Takes too long to find a group.  You can't just turn on LFG and expect to
get a group - you have to be pro-active.  Even being pro-active figure 30 to 40
minutes to get together and at the dungeon zone line.  Figure another 30
minutes after the crawl to get out, get back to a merchant, sell and divide
loot.  If SOE would have thought this through they would have let you meet up
*at* the dungeon zone line, group there, get mission there and zone there. 
Merchant would be standing nearby.   I don't understand *why* they set this up
in multiple zones...  
2.  I get stir crazy.  I'm not used to sitting in a chair for hours on end
without moving around.  By the time we get done I feel like my entire body has
fallen asleep.  And at level 57 we really have to PUSH to get through.  It was
work.   No fun and games, no drinking a few beers and chitchatting while
medding.  Even with KEI my ranger was perpetually at 20% mana!  (I was casting
greater heal on the shaman so he could canibalize).
3. I'm just not impressed with the cash, loot, or experience.  If you fail the
mission you don't even get any dungeon points *AT ALL*.  This absolutely blew
my mind!  We were almost through one dungeon when the groupleader, (who was MT)
and cleric had to leave for a guild raid, (*don't* *even* get me started). 
When they admitted this one guy disbanded and ported out without a word - my
ranger can't port or I'd have probably done the same thing.  We'd been in there
forEVER and we kicked BUTT and we didn't get ANYTHING!!  except some crappy
ranger/rogue/shaman gloves with 14 armor class and 5 intelligence. 
Intelligence on r/r/s gloves?  Hello?  We rolled on them because they were
junk.  They are on my selling mule.  Whatever.  Average split at level 57 has
been around 160 plat per person.  Figure 3 hours including the circle jerk,
thats 60 plat per hour.  Woo woo.

Ok, end of rant.  I doubt we'll spend much time doing these dungeons.  Just not
worth it *to us*.
