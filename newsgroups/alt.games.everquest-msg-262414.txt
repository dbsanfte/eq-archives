The Democratic party doesn't think that.

The Democratic party doesn't think that, either.

After paying into Social Security for decades, don't you think it's
fair they should be able to count on getting something in return?

What "threats by the Dems"?

This is an outright fabrication.

The problem isn't with the rich getting richer, it's with the widening
gap between the rich and the poor.  Do you want America to turn into a
third world country?  Having a wealthy and large middle class is just
as good for the upper class as it is for the middle class.

What's wrong is fiscally irresponsible republican administrations who
borrow and spend.

Bullshit rhetoric.  Workers provide value and create wealth.  The
wealthy are just very good at exploiting workers.  Ultimately, all
things are paid for by the workers, the individuals who generate value
and wealth.  Just because a disproportionate amount of wealth flows to
the wealthy first doesn't change the facts.

Nonsense.  Democrats and republicans alike agree the welfare system
should be reformed.  Besides, the food stamp program is barely a blip
on the federal budget.  Quit worrying over pennies.

The people who make the economy grow are the workers, because they're
the ones generating value and wealth.
