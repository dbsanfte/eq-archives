Shadowknight pro:  Snare, more hp, more AC, faster feign for 3 tries if they
are prepared, instant invis

Monk pro: Can't be interrupted (can feign while running, getting hit, etc.),
can feign while out of mana, can feign while stunned, mend, stonestance,
sneak

Monks are generally better pullers, but there are some pulls/places where
SKs are better.
