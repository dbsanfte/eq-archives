Buy it from player smiths. It's MUCH cheaper that way than shopping
for bits at venders. The going rate for banded on the 4 servers I play on
is 1PP per AC of the armor. Very cheap compared to vendor armor.

I would try auctioning "WTB banded armor, either M or L"
back in GFey, Freeport, and the EC tunnel vendor area.
Most player smiths make it to order and need access to a forge
and appropriate molds to fill your order. I actually got mine made
up by a fellow Barb right in Halas. It just took a few online days to
meet up with a smith online when i was.

Your 80 PP won't even come close to building up your tailoring skill
to reliably make studded armor. And metal studs have to be made by
player smiths but they are pretty easy to make. It's just not worthwhile
for you to go this way unless you want to pump both lots of time and PP
into developing both your tailoring skill and smithing skill.

My Barb shammy is still doing both at 19th and he's just started making
some easier pieces of banded armor now. He's been making studded
since level 13. Long and slow process but I like working the tradeskills
for my own roleplaying enjoyment. He's a master potter and cook too but
they both go up really fast and easy, especially pottery.

Hope this helped you some.
