: Pets regen 10x faster than a player?  meaning you can kill more things in a
: given time period.

Ha! Very good point I completely forgot. Yet I must say, so far (ok, I have
a mildly twinked BST (gnome skin armour, sarnak tabard and a centi warhammer)
the mob always attacks me. The pet isn't capable of killing alone what I'm used
to with other classes, like yellow skeletons in Kurns (works at lower levels)
with a Shaman, an SK, a Necro and a Monk. If I join the fight myself, I can
take down even reds at this stage. The mob then hits me, though, and I'll
have to sit down, since we're not very protected. I guess the idea would be
to let the pet take care of loads of blues itself. Have not tried that, yet, as
I get too bored if not fighting myself and I want to keep my defense and offense
at maximum. This way, I always outperform my pet (due to twinkage) and the BST
turns out quite powerful.

As in another thread, I see problems in future though. I have a lvl 53 Shaman.
My experience at higher level tells me, that I won't be able to survive anything
in direct contact with just leatehr armour. And the pet will have to take all
damage? Something like that .... Any high level BST around to talk about
experience? Also, half of my time I am in dungeons and on high level raids.
How does a BST fare there? One thing sounds quite cool: Why go into a wild
AoE casting nasty, when you can have a relatively cheap pet and send it in
again as soon as it dies, while staying out of harm yourself? A group of 
25 Beastlords whould be pretty funny... :)
