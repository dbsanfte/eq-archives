I sincerely appreciate everyone's comments...you have made a valid
point that I had not quite forseen.

Perhaps a little background would be in order:

I am 32 yrs old, and I have been roleplaying since the early-eighties.
Myself, and a close friend of mine whom I graduated high school with
in 1988, have been playing EQ for about 8 months.

He got me interested in EQ after some co-workers of his turned him
onto the game.  They have high level characters on Bertox who are all
guild members in high-level guilds.  (Devine in most cases)

I have spurred some interest with my coworkers as well and we all have
characters in or about the mid-twenties.

We spend most of our game time grouped with each other or at least in
direct communications with each other over the telephone while we
play.  We have watched some of our friends' high-level characters go
on guild raids and speak highly of their guilds...and we wish to form
our own as well.

There are about 7 of us...we do not have enough "accounts" to start
our own guild.

Therefore we have offered an open invitation for others to join...this
will be a mid-level guild...not exactly for high level characters as
we do not have anything to offer high-level characters.

We have made in-game contacts with several players whom are interested
as well...in all about 20 characters have expressed at least SOME
interest in helping get the guild off the ground.

As far as addressing the "chronic guild starter's syndrome" you are
correct...guilds started on the fly by actioning off officer positions
seldom make the cut...I got in on one just so I could see how the
process worked.

The guild I joined was created solely so that the "guild leader" could
declare war against one of his/her friend's guild so they could PVP
everywhere.

This was not known at the time and the guild lasted about 2 weeks.

But in our case, the cornerstone has been laid...now we seek others
who would wish to truly play a part in their own guild.

Are we going to be able to keep ALL the "rabble" from joining or
taking advantage of our offer...probably not...but we WILL take steps
to eliminate them from the guild once they have revealed
themselves...and that's the best that anyone can offer or hope to
accomplish.

As far as in-game announcements go...I have not made any.   We are not
yet to that stage...this is currently still on the PLAYER LEVEL...not
on a character level.  All the officer positions will be filled
through direct player to player communication OUT-GAME before we
proceed.

I hope I have addressed the correct concerns...and that now you are
better informed of our intentions.  Of course, some will not like the
idea of such a close-knit group running a guild...but others will take
it as a sign of stability and solidarity of purpose.

Again...anyone interested in helping us please contact me at
durfea@shadow-council.com

If you have any more ideas, please send them to me as well.

If you are not interested in this guild, then thanks for your time
anyway.

Mike
