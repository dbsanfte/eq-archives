Pets always melee at max melee range, so "mob is rooted" is unlikely to 
affect aggro for them, except I suppose if they are also rooted.

That would be an interesting experiment, root a mob, then charm it, then 
root another mob, and use easily controlled push (say from cleric stuns)
to shove the target closer to the pet, then have a PC come in and melee 
from past the pet.  Will the rooted mob obey his "PC's first" rule, or 
his "I'm rooted I hit whatever is closest" rule?

Or will his virtual brain hemmorage?

Of course charmed mobs do obey slightly different rules than real pets, 
so we'd also want to try attacking rooting mobs, ghouls for example, 
having a pet tank them until they proc root on him, then once again 
shoving the ghoul close and trying melee from further away.

If this works though, I imagine that it would be far more useful for 
charmed pets, which tend to have much better HP bars than real pets.  A 
lament is that this feature of charmed pets is only really useful in a 
group with no melee.

Sadly, the simple methods for pushing the mob tend to have a DD 
component, which can often break root, so this will require more 
planning to turn into a really useful tactic, if it turns out it works.
