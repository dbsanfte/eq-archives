Note that store bought grapes are NOT the same as foraged fruit and
berries (just the same graphic)

To make drinks, you need to find a brew barrel. Left click on it to
open it - your inventory will open as you do that - and put in the
ingredients without stacking and hit the combine button. Recipes are
mentioned in other posts in this thread... If you want to make fruit
juice, you need to get fruit or berries from a foraging class, such as
a ranger or a druid.

There is a brew barrel outside the store with brewing ingredients in
West Freeport, close to the Militia headquarters.
