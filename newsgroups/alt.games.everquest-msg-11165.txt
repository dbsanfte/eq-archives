I don't know if this will work for Enchanters or if it is just a Druid
thing, but I've noticed that if I charm (er...befriend, actually, since
I'm not high enough for "Charm Animal") a wolf, and then have it attack
something while a bear is passing by, the bear helps the wolf.

Note that the bear is *not* charmed, so if the bear and wolf and I win,
and then charm breaks and the wolf turns on me, the bear leaves me
alone.  The wolf is very green, so I have no trouble killing it.

Note also that since the wolf is very green, it usually dies quickly in
the battle, so it doesn't even get to the point of worrying about broken
charm.  The wolf's job is just to get the bear into the fight.
