Actually, given a glitch I encountered, I doubt it'll be just painting
over the existing color. All of my characters after a patch or so ago
were all wearing "base" colored armor when I first logged them in for
the first time after the patch. Such as a bard in silver lambent,
brown chitin leggings were silver, etc. Possibly a hint that the
original colors will be overridden when you dye them...
