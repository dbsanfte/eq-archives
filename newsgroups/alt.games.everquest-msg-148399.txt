<snip>  I'm new to rangers and melee and would like to hear other's
opinions, hints and tips.  Thanks for the help and take care =)


Strength is nice for carrying things around.  Stamina is good for dual
wielding.  I suggest not putting too much faith in stats.  Keep your
1hs/1hb/pierce maxed and then use a two hander and hide behind a warrior in
a group.  A slower weapon will help you manage aggro and keep you alive
(imagine that, a ranger that doesn't die every other pull) and deal out some
good dammage also.  When you hit 30 and get SoW, soloing will become much
easier since you can snare and run away from just about anything.

If you are going to work on any tradeskills, gather up some wisdom gear or
dex gear if you plan to fletch.  Some cha gear is also nice to have on hand
for buying and selling.
