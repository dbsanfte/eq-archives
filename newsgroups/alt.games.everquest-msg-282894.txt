So, my lizard monk on Druzzil Ro hit 49 yesterday. He's the highest level
character I've ever had in the 3.5 years I've been playing EQ. I really
don't know the "high end" (to me at least) game. I have no idea where I
should go hunting next and I'm looking for suggestions.

The monk lives by the no-self-twinking rules: everything he's got is killed,
quested, or crafted by himself. He's kitted out in a mixture of Expert
Shadowrise and Wu's. Weapons are Patchwork Jetsam, or 2 Polished Steel
Ulaks. I love tradeskills. I love quests. Just got the Shackle of Tynnonium,
and only Targin the Rock keeps me from the Robe of the Lost Circle. I've
got the LoY quested melee haste item. I'm not guilded, and not really
looking to be.

I regularly duo with a friend's lizard necro, also, not coincidentally,
49. The breakdown would likely be duo with necro 70%, group with necro and
others 20%, solo 10%. It's not that we're snobbish, it's that not many
folks are interested in straying far from the Paludal highway. She's got
a 54 druid from way back in the Luclin era, but really doesn't remember
much from that experience. She also enjoys much the same stuff I do aside
from tradeskilling.

It's totally insane of us, but we've been known to venture forth from Plane
of Knowledge without temp, virtue, fo7, hos, kei, sow, or soe. We're not
above using Tribute, Leadership, or Veteran rewards though.

LDoNs are okay, if only for a change of pace. Haven't done any monster
missions yet. For whimsical reasons, I'm up to dubious with most of kael,
and haven't quite gotten to kos in thurgadin, but that's just a matter of
time. I've wandered around in Plane of Tranquility and Plane of Justice,
but have never hunted anywhere but Norrath and Luclin.

Our idea of fun places to hunt include SolA, the old Splitpaw beyond the
double doors, grimling caves in tenebrous, guards in katta, crystal caverns,
goblins in frontier mountains, city of mist, upper and lower guk, gunthak,
and dulak. We were very disappointed that we didn't get around to the
hollowshade moor war or the gunthak finger bone stuff. For faction reasons,
prayer shawls and coldain rings are pretty much right out too.

There aren't many places we avoid, generally. Places that are deucedly
difficult to get to or from without outside assistance: various planes,
Cobalt Scar, etc. We're not keyed for Paineel, ToFS, Plane of Time B, or
anything else. We prefer to avoid the uber-fast xp expressways, if only
because we're not so interested in reaching L70 five minutes ago.

Loot is good. Tradeskill drops are good. Xp is good. Fun is better than good :)

What do you guys recommend?
