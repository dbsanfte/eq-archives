>Oh man, did they appear on all servers? And did you get any screenshots?

It happened on EMarr the night before patch. I kinda hope it wasn't
staged while I was playing, this is an event I'd really have wanted to
see/participate in. There's a description of the event on Luclin on
Everlore, ending with Firiona cutting off the unicorn horn and being
cursed by CT as the result.

The Faydarks are the only place they could stage this... it's the home
of Tunare's people, of Firiona and of the unicorns. It's the only
place that makes sense from a roleplaying perspective.

It's a bloody shame when people mess up events like this and I can
only wonder if anyone would have gotten trouble for 'accidentally'
porting some of the troublemakers out of there in this case...
