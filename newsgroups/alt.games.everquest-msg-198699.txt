I'm missing the DKP system my old guild had.  The new guild (we merged) 
just uses /rand by classes that can/will use.  End result: people who need 
better gear get left in the cold while the lucky ones get more and more 
upgrades.  I can't really complain, I've gotten quite a few upgrades out of 
the system, but I think people should be rewarded more for showing up 
continuously than just showing up and getting lucky with a /rand.

A good accounting system is definitely in order for something like that 
though.
