NEVER MIND guys!

I went out to the used computer shop here in Austin and got  a used
16M Rage Fury Pro (AGP)  for $20.
Solved all my problems.

To be honest, it is like Night and Day!   Almost plays like a
compleatly different game!  
So THATS what the sky looks like.....  Wow!

Thanks for the help
