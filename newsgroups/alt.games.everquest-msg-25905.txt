This is what I decide to do got the fish from the dog. Now to see if I can
get the book because my druid has most of the items and the enchanter has
the nut and is the one that wants the stein. They say that two people can
give him the items as long as the enchanter is the last and he gives him the
nut shall see if not the enchanter will have to do the whole quest.
