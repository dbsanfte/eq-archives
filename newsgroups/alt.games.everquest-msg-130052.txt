You are forgetting the course of the conversation.  This mention
of "women suicide bombers" came back as an answer to
Locust going "950?? Including women and children?"

It seemed a suggestion that virtually all the women and children
killed were *actually* suicide bombers - which is just a lie.

The only two women suicide bombers I've heard of died in their
own explosions.  The suggestion that *all* these women and
children are actually combatants is just sick and blind.

Talk about weak - if your justification of the murder of
Palestinian women and children relies on you having seen
the picture of *one* female suicide bomber on the cover
of a magazine.
