Breeze is +2/tick at 16 (level of a caster) and lasts 27 minutes
At 29 comes C1 that is +4/tick and get +9 at 65. Lasts the same 27 minutes.
Neither have a level limit to them.
Boon of clear mind is nothing but a group clarity with the same duration and
regen rate (+6 at lvl 44 and +9 at 65)
C2 is +11 at 52 can be cast only on 41 and up. It doesn't go up as C1 does,
but lasts a bit longer (35-36 mins)
C2 can stack with Gift series which are G. of Insight (+1 at 56 and +2 at
65, don't know when it actually goes up) and G. of Brilliance (didn't bother
to get one, since it doesn't stack with KEI, but I think it's a +2). These 2
Gifts series spells cannot be cast on anyone lower 41.

And then goes KEI and other goodies which at lvl 14 you cannot benefit from.
But at any rate, find the 65 enchanter in POK and ask him to buff you up,
he'll know what to do. And probably it won't even cost you anything -- 
he/she'll just smile at your toon on the screen if they get message "This
spell is too powerful for intended target"

Just my 2 cent.
Nick
