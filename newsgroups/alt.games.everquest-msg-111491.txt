    Of course not - they're your employer, and there's a different test as
to whether someone can be fired for something. That's not very relevant
here, unless you're trying to establish that somehow I have a duty to Verant
to protect my password that would be present even if they specifically
didn't say "you cannot sell your password".

    That's partially true (things like maintenance on the vehicle can be
built into the lease agreement), but irrelevant. Who has title to what is
the same in both cases. Monthly payments for use are the same in both cases.
The legality is established for leases - you have to specify what uses the
vehicle can have or you're SOL (most leases specify "for personal use" and
have a mileage limit to further restrict possible activities). Verant would
also be up the creek without a legal paddle if they didn't state "...and you
can't do this, we can pull the account if it happens".

    I'd follow this analogy if Verant screened their customers for
"suitability" like a landlord does. But they don't.
