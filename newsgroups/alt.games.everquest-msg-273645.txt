Thank you. =P

I know that my opening sentence says pretty much what you're saying here, 
but in retrospect it's clear that the guy lied about his past during his 
recruitment period, and if that's not a violation of our rules (arguably it 
is a violation of our code of conduct), it's certainly enough of a violation 
of trust and common sense in my universe to justify the de-tag. In any case, 
I didn't post this with the intent to solicit justification, but for the 
sheer entertainment value.
