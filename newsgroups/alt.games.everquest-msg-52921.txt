Bullshit .

Big mobs require complete aggro control and require the FULL force to be on
the target . The no immediete melee back sounds good on paper but in
practice is just assine . If you plan on doing in combat resses the piddly
speed debuff on res effects is not going to effect you in the slightest . If
you are not planning on doing in combat resses and your tanks are dying then
you lost already . Big uber mob raids tend to have everyone who didnt do
anything really stupid to live OR for the whole raid to fail . This middle
ground where a few tanks could run in and turn the tide just dosent exist
EVER.

There is no excuse at all for the melee binding issue and never was. Not
being able to bind in post kunark dungeons is all the restriction that would
ever be required.
