Not that I want to purchase, as I have a few mid 50's myself that suck up
enough of my time, but do I understand you correctly that you want me to
send you money blindly before you even verify you have the characters (won't
show them in game until payment received in full).  You may be the most
honest guy (or gal) in the world, but no way would I even think about buying
that account with a proviso like that...basically send you a few hundred
bucks on the outside chance I'll get what I purchased....good luck to you...
