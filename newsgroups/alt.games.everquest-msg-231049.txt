No.  He also didn't coin the term "hobbit".

I found a list of names of fey creatures one time, a list from the 1800s.
It included the term "hobbit".

As for halfling, that was, as far as I know, coined by Gygax et al when the
lawyers were aimed at them by the JRRT people.  They replaced hobbit with
halfling and ent with treant.  Other things too, maybe, but I can't remember
off the top of my head.
