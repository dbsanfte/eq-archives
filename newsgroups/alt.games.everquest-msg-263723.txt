Yes, that's handy, but it does have downsides.  In particular,
it's awkward that there's no simply way to do what EQ /assist
does: target whatever your current target is focussed on.

Sure, if all you want to do is cast one spell on it, it's
handy not having to switch.  (Me, when healing myself during
a solo melee, I don't find it too hard to do TAB, ctrl-# to
cast, TAB.  Given that I'm not swinging again until the cast
finishes, the timing isn't critical aside from trying to start
the cast right after a swing by me, or right after a swing by
the mob, depending on whether I'm worried about interrupts.)

But suppose you want to let the MA pick a target to be off-tanked,
and then pick the main target for everyone else?  If everyone is
depending on targetting indirectly through the MA, you're out of
luck.  And I know there've been other cases where friends have
described situations that gave them trouble in CoH and my reaction
was that /assist would've handled it.
