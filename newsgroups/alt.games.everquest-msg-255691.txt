    I'll point out places where I think you got it right, and where you got
it wrong.

    Unless you're in a guild with people your level, you're stuck with what
you get when doing pick-up. That's been true since day one, and is the
toughest part of grouping. The good news is the more grouping you do, the
more you learn who your level is an asshat and who knows their stuff. By
soloing 6 levels, you've lost some of that info. Making good contacts is an
important part of EQ.

    108 AA's and 7500 raid buffed is nothing to sneeze at. I'd consider that
very successful.

    So why go to PoI? Each expansion is playtested by people wearing all the
latest stuff from the previous expansions, so a level 40 mob from GoD is a
lot tougher than a level 40 mob from Kunark even though both likely give the
same or similar XP. Use that to your advantage. Karnor's would have been a
good place to go, especially if you had guild friends that could go with
you. It was designed with people with only Fear/Hate armour and weaponry
like the Dark Reaver, so even in Darkforge you would have made a credible
tank.

> My friend's Shaman alt appeared. The SK/Shaman duo opened doors.

    Friends open up a lot of places that may be too low population for
pickup groups. This allowed you to pick whatever zone suited you best.

WMBS

    WMBS was also pretty underpriced for the longest time, until people
who'd parsed opened their mouths. Knowing the bargains in The Bazaar can
really stretch that plat out. Note that you were gearing up off content that
was several expansions old - as intended. A lot of people skip to more
modern content, with the relatively low plat drops/item drops, and end up
high level with poor gear because of it.

    This isn't good for the game, though, because what you could do solo or
with a friend, a real soloist (65 ENC or NEC) can do several of. There's
already 65 ENCs on my server that camp most of Veksar at once. That means
content that should occupy several people to justify the development cost is
only occupying a few, and the game gets mudflated severely with several
quality droppables being farmed 24/7. It would be better if solo/duo
LDoN-style adventures were made, so Mr. Uberfarmer couldn't bottom feed his
way to glory.

    Veksar wasn't close to this, unless you're talking about the raid drops
from the dragon. Kylong Darkmail is good, but it doesn't compare to Velious
end raid drops (which would be the comparable 2nd best previous). Compare
that 12/20 1HS to a 13/20-and-procs-Avatar-for-100-ATK weapon from
Sleeper's - not close.

    Honestly, I think the stuff falling in the Sewer trials in Barindu meets
your qualifications, except that I don't believe it's duoable/soloable. But
you've got stuff in there that equals or betters LDoN Hard drops, only the
mobs generally aren't as tough as LDoN Hard.

    Were I you, the next step would be LDoN hard adventures. The XP is
fairly close to the vaunted elemental XP, and the drops are real upgrades
with some nice foci/effects. It might even be worth taking losses on LDoN
hards and just farming them for the drops.
