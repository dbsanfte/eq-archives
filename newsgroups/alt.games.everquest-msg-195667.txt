How about while casting standard spells? (I know you med while
casting R-clickies)

The reason I ask is that I always seem to reach FM using Pet
Canni faster than my calculations indicate.  Some of us have
speculated that the savings on the enshrouded veil was fixed
25% rather than variable (avg 13%) because of this.  That 12%
is worth 24mana per reclaim, I reclaim every 8.5 secs.  So,
medding mana regen could easily explain this instead of the
veil having a fixed rate.  Problem is, I used to forget I was
on a horse (had all models turned off) and I never did really
good tests.  The closest I had was going OOM to FM (around 
3000 mana without KEI on) with 1 MR2 charge and just over 2 minutes
of pet canni.  My calculations said it should be closer to 3.
I know how long it took because I run a 5 minute timer to
remind me to rod, and it showed just under 3 minutes left on it.
