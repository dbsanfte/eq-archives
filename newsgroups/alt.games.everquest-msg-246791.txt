}Again, I think I'm missing something. What does your firewall have to do

I'm not a security guru, so I must admit that is somewhat mysterious to 
me. :)

}If it's open for the activeX component you 
}don't have to completely shut down the Firewall do you? Just allow it to 
}go through and then turn it back on yes?

No, I didn't have to shut down the firewall, I had to turn on the 
computer's ability to do ActiveX.  This, I have been told, makes my 
computer more vulnerable to attacks, with or without a firewall.  And yes, 
when I was done, I turned that back off.

}I think I'm completely missing the point of this hub bub. On the one 
}hand it looks like a harmless applet that you run and turn off, just 
}like you would do any other program out there, but to hear people talk 
}about it after running it we're all going to be probed by aliens in bad 
}places and our HD's will be e-mailed to MS or somesuch alarmist hoohah.
}Nobody really believes that turning on IE for two minutes will result in 
}their children being kidnapped and sent to comfort MJ in neverland do they?

No, but we do believe that during that time that IE + ActiveX is on, we 
are more vulnerable to attacks that could, for example, install 
annoying-ass spyware on our PC.  Or viruses that could muck up our entire 
hard drive and cause us to spend half a day reinstalling everything from 
backups, or possibly in the worst case, having to throw it out and get a 
new hard drive.

}OK, 1500 hits in a couple months... assuming that's 2 months with, we'll 
}round down, 30 days each that 1500 hits/60 days/24hrs = just over 1 hit 
}per hour. So worst case, using your number you've got a 1/30 chance of 
}being hit before things are locked up again? And we're all locking 
}ourselves in a panic room over those odds? *boggle* 

It's hardly a panic room.  I agree with your 1 in 30 calculation, but I'd 
probably make it more like 1 in 1000 of an actual effective attack in that 
time frame.  But the point is very simple.  SoE had a choice between an 
implementation of the app process that exposed us all to 1 in 1000 risk, 
and one that exposed us to no risk at all.  Would you rather take a small 
risk, or no risk, given a totally free choice between the two?

Personally, if I have nothing to gain taking the small risk over the no 
risk, I'd take the no risk every time.  And I will criticise SoE for 
making me take the small risk.  If we don't criticise that sort of 
behavior, companies will not see the disadvantage in making their users 
take a small risk.  And then more companies will choose the small risk 
option, and then eventually, we'll be randomly expected to take the small 
risk on a regular basis.  And even a 1 in 1000 risk, taken 1000 times, is 
a 63.2% chance of something really annoying happening.

}Maybe I'm naive, but 
}since '93 I've only used non-ie for the past year. I've never had a 
}virus, never been hijacked by any activeX components, and the most 
}malicious thing I've had to deal with has been spyware cookies but who 
}cares about those, just remove cookies every once in a while.

Personally, I've had a lot worse than spyware cookies.  That's why I 
finally decided I needed a firewall.  The worst I personally had was 
spyware apps that set themselves to autorun on reboot, and somehow managed 
to conflict with EQ.

}*Grin* Maybe I'm in the internet burbs and y'all just hang in the 'net 
}hood rofl. :)

Quite possible.  I have a popular ISP, sbcyahoo.  Having anything about 
your PC that's 'popular' makes you more prone to atttack.  Windows is the 
most-used OS, so naturally it has the most known vulnerabilities that are 
regularly exploited.  Similar arguments apply to IE, the most used 
browser, and Outlook, the most used mail agent.

The most secure computer I've ever used was a VAX VMS system.  Most people 
haven't even heard of those!  So naturally, it got smacked with a lot less 
bad stuff.  Never underestimate the power of security through obscurity!
