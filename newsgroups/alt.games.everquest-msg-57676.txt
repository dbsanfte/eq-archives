Jewelry?

My lvl 49 mage is now saving cash and gems he finds to take up jewelry. The
skill won't be really profitable until you get to 100 skill or such, and
that takes roughly 500pp or so. Getting it up to 200 would range into the
2kpp range (with my 205 int, 218 if I can find a chanter buddy).

Tradeskills require a high int or wis to go up fast in skill, considering
your war has neither I would suggest Smithing because that has an extra
check for strength.

For the rest, go to www.eqtraders.com for good guides on all tradeskills.
