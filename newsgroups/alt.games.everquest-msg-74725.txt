Is that a quest? just do what the quest tells you to do.

Its a guard exclusive shield in that even if you kill those guards the
shield can't be worn by players so its useless. Its a shield graphic
on them, but not really a shield. Its kind of sad because I thought
that in early luclin screenshots there was a kitty player with such a
shield but it seems they are not in the game.

No. That is kind of like asking if there is a way to make the magician
summoned food or water perm, also no.

I still don't get that.
