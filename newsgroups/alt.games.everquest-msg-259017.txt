Not in EQ at this point in time, no. But yeah, i have BTDT. And -yes- 
I'm well aware that GoD has boosted the complexity of ecounters, but 
imo, that only makes the execution more important. All indications that 
I've seen show that the strategy is not the major stumbling block to 
progression. Even though the the strategies are more complicated, they 
are fairly apparent once you've wiped to the various 'tricks'.

I think the greater learning curve is in following the strategy, not 
devising it.

Yes. Feel better?

So far the only real reason postulated is the length of time to gear up 
and advance further 'doubles' if you are -competing- for spawns. And yes 
this is a legitimate gripe. However:

First this -presumes- that competing guilds on your server will be able 
to execute the strat and immediately invade your new stomping ground... 
at best you've given them a leg up... you haven't handed them the keys 
on a silver platter.

Moreover, this is -only- true due to game design issues within EQ, 
ideally the primary 'candy' spawns should be fast and/or instanced, so 
you don't have to compete for spawns. And SOE is gradually learning on 
this front.

And finally, on some level: Who gives a shit? So what if you have to 
cancel some raids because the zone is empty? This is a problem for every 
other guild on the server after all. What difference does it make if it 
takes you longer to get to the next zone? The next zone isn't going 
anywhere, and will still be there next week. Hoarding info so that 'your 
guild' can have the most 'server firsts' or some such nonsense is a 
textbook definition of elitism. "If -I- can't go, I'm sure as hell gonna 
make sure I'm not helping anybody else!"

I wouldn't know anything about your lack of friends or self esteem... :)

I think your hostility on this point only underscores my position that 
many members of end game raid guilds are highly elitist.

So your saying SOE did a typical bang up job. :)
Everyone agrees GoD progression is ... screwed up.

Another serious flaw.

Good rpgs are designed to allow players to avoid death as much as 
possible, and death is a -bad thing- when it occurs. 

In EQ:

Dying as a noob at level 6 is irrelevant.

Dying in a group or solo at level 35 can really hurt. (Can hurt the 
group, can make for a very difficult CR, can cost you a great deal of 
effort...)

Dying in a raid guild at 65 ... is irrelevant again.

Strange that, and dumb, if you ask me.

Trial and error is the -least- sophisticated approach to a problem. Its 
what you do when there is no other logical way to proceed. Its dismal 
that this is the eq model for problem solving.
