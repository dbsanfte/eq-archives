That doesn't imply an open beta, though.  For a load test, they only need
enough people to fill the existing beta servers.  They can probably easily
get that just by letting in everyone who signed up on the web site a few
months ago.

In fact, it would not surprise me if the beta invites about three weeks ago,
the ones that went out a week or so before the NDA was lifted, are just for
that.  I got one, and I am not in any of the "special" groups that they
favored (never played on Legends, didn't buy LoE) and don't even have an
active EQ1 subscription (cancelled something like 9 months ago), so I
suspect me getting in means they were doing the "let in everyone who asked
to be in" stage.
