1.  I can't go into windows mode.  The problem is similar to when the game
engine was upgraded in March - the screen goes black and I have to reboot.

2.  I can't zone into Butcherblock Mountains from Greater Faydark - I get
stuck between zones.  Some players in GFay told me they were able to zone in
but had to leave because the lag in BB was so bad.

Completed bug reports on both.
