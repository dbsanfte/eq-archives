BAotR:
Self: Increase Hitpoints by 294 - 300
 Self: Increase AC by 30
 Self: Increase Mana Regen (6 per tick)

PotG:
Group: Increase AC (24)
 Group: Increase Hitpoints (450)
 Group: Mana Regen (6 per tick)

So you want 150 LESS hit points for 6 more AC?

Sorry but I'd rather have the PoTG all day long.
