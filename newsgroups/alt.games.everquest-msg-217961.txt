IIRC, it is not possible for Taunt to work on a mob higher level than
you unless you are a 60+ Warrior.  OTOH, Taunt skill-ups have nothing
to do with the level of the NPC you target, you can skill-up on mobs
of any level (unlike weapon skills, where after around L20 your chance
of getting a skill-up from an attack on a green mob is pretty much
indistinguishable from zero).

Sure, but if the PLee has a clue s/he is mashing Taunt the whole time,
all that's required is to be close enough to a targeted NPC to have a
shot at a skill-up.

Not saying that PLing makes for good practice at handling a melee's
role in a group, just that any melee combat environment (even farming
greens) can serve for Taunt practice.
