For me, at least, it's the travel time, not the XP loss. Experience I 
can get back with relatively little effort, especially when in a full 
group; I'm back up to where I was with two or three kills. No, it's the 
*running* all the way back through these expansive zones which irks me, 
every time. Even with Planes of Power, some of the good ZEM areas are 
two or three zones away from the portals, much less my bind point.

Take, for example, Keros' jaunt into Highpass Hold, where he grouped 
with five mages to act as main distraction^Wtank. One of the mages was 
kind enough to bind him close to the action, and it suddenly changed 
the scope of the battle for me; he could leap into the fray right after 
he dropped. Death was no longer a detriment, but a tool.

(then, of course, I forgot to re-bind when I later left the group, and 
it was a PITA having to run all the way through the Karanas ... but 
that's another story)

I think they should do this for the immersion factor, if nothing else. 
It disturbs me to see these guys pop right into place (it also causes 
some z-axis issues for Quest/Merchant NPCs)[1]; much better to have 
them respawn at zone-in points -- or, to not kill newcomers to the zone 
almost instantly, points along the edge of the zone -- and then walk 
back. Baddies in dungeons should spawn at the "bottom" of the dungeon, 
near the boss, and walk back through their higher-level comrades.

You've just basically described LDoN. Instanced dungeons are a better 
way of doing this, IMHO; at least then no one's prevented from doing a 
dungeon crawl just because it's already taken.



[1] Case in point: someone killed the merchant near the lake in West 
Commonlands. She drops from the sky, as spawns are wont to do, and she 
lands on the roof of the building she *was* in. No way to reach her, 
nothing to jump onto to get to her, and I sure wasn't going to shoot 
her down.
