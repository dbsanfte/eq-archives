I loved CC. I loved the orcs outside too -- got some ry'gorr armor and a
bunch of earrings from charming with my druid brother. Those elites really
can beat the crap out of stuff. I've moved on for now, though..

Apparently, there's no way to raise faction yet. You'll need an enchanter,
or someone to hide/sneak to buy or sell for you.
