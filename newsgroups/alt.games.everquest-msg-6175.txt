You didn't even have to bother saying you've never played a paladin as it is
obvious from your completely moronic statements. Paladins and Sk's add
plenty to the group and in my experience are always welcome. Sure they might
be less useful in uber encounters but they're still good to take along and
IMO they are infinitely more fun to play than a warrior.
