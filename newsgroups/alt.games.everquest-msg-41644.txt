Ok, clearing up a few misconceptions.
- No exp loss due to dying in PvP

- No coin or item loss (you respawn with all
  your stuff)

- The only reason to return to the location you died
   in DAoC is to mitigate exp loss by praying at your
   grave, which you don't have to do in a pvp death.

-  Bind points are in the home areas of your realm,
   so the likelyhood of enemies being near it are low.

-  The last two elements get rid of corpse and bind
    point camping potential.

-  If your side wins, you won't even have to run back
   from your bind point, most likely, since 2 classes
   from each realm (3 from Hibernia) get at least the
   minimal res spell (you appear with very few hit points)
   by level 10.

-  The intention for release is that no one under level
   20 can even enter the pvp areas (right now it is 15)

-  Leveling from 1-20 is reportedly quite easy (after
   which it gets far slower)

So you lose absolutely nothing by engaging in PvP,
but stand to gain realm points.

PvP in EQ never appealed to me, but I'm looking
forward to trying it in DAoC.
