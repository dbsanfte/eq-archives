8 hours exping, ONE DOUBLE PULL THE WHOLE NIGHT, ranger pulling the whole
time.
HoH, level 62-65 mobs.  So whatever you say.

Harmony is a great spell outdoors, regardless of what other classes have
(lull/pacification is a bit whacked but hey), and rangers make better
pullers than clerics for the following reasons

a) snare
b) root

For dealing with the mob and not getting smacked down on the pull

c) Invis (or even better, innate camo) so you don't accidently walk into a
few mobs (e.g changing of the guard)

Rangers make better pullers than chanters for the following reasons:
a
c
d) If your not at camp and your charm breaks out.. it could be quite a
problem..

Err wtf are you talking bout?
Im gonna let you in on a little secret here...  let the paladin AE brells
first(or every group individually, whatever) and then for a minimum of 1hour
20 (possibly 2hr 30+mods) theres no need to recast it - so then cast your
SoT.

I did VT all Sunday night, I had SoT up 98% of the time, and I was grouped
with a cleric and druid who both prefered Brells.

Doesn't include burning peridots every 5 mins to keep your ass a little
extra ATK buffed im sure

And hey, maybe your guild has lots of Shamans and Beastlords that you get
your own personal buff bish to keep both spells on you every 5 mins, but I
doubt it.

> Shaman and Beastlords can add more ATK than Rangers.  Fact.

For 6 mins, at high cost.

Then why the fuck are you whining about your pulling ability, when you can
pull better and faster than a monk outdoors?

My class pulls..  thats my job.  You can do it better than me in outdoor
zones.  But yeah, keep whining your ability to do it got nerfed.
