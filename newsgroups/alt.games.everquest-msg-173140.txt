Ok, I'll bite. How would one actually "bag" that oil reserve? If the 
dictatorship falls and Saddam is ousted, Iraq will still have to be run by 
someone. Do you actually think that the new government would then turn the 
oil over to the US gratis? No, we would still have to purchase the oil from 
them, as we do now from the other Middle Eastern countries. Make no 
mistake, it would be a nice reserve to have. But also make no mistake, we 
don't need their oil, we have plenty of other avenues. It would most likely 
benefit Europe more than the US.

And the US used to hate England, and I am glad that it doesn't anymore. I 
am also glad that when the US entered WWII, that we helped England defend 
her borders from Germany. We had tried to keep ourselves out of the world 
problems, but were dragged in. It would have been real easy to just deal 
with Japan, and leave England to deal with Germany herself. The point is 
that leaders, and times change.

Sham or not, the doubt I am casting is his view that we shouldn't pray for 
our troops going overseas.
