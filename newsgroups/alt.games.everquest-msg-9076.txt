Ahem *cough* that's 30th level. (Ok... I only made it last night, but I was so
thrilled that I had to point it out.)
As much as I enjoy baiting Dan just to read his witty comebacks, I have to say
that this particular thread has been one of the most enjoyable and educational
ones that I've participated in here.  And yes, James, both he and you have
obviously been correct all along, but it's very helpful for us lower levels to
get full explanations like this.  By now I have well learned that the game keeps
changing as you get higher in level, and it's tough to appreciate those changes
until you get there and go through the school of hard knocks.
   For instance, back around level 10 to 12 with my first characters, I kept
reading here about "you have to start grouping and learn good group skills."  My
immediate reaction was, "Fuck you. I've solo'd my way this far, and I'll do it
to 60. Tell Verant to stop nerfing the soloers."  Of course, by my early
twenties, I found that this was a good way to die a lot or level so slowly that
I'd probably need a full year off from work to make level 30.
   In my early twenties, when the various classes began to become clearly
defined from one another, and their place in groups *began* to become more
obvious, I looked at chanters as somebody who the casters hoped would wander by
and give them a quick mana battery shot, and that was about it. Now at level 30,
the game has changed enough where I really hope for an enchanter in my group for
the wide variety of "value adds" that they bring to the table.  But it's obvious
that I still hadn't learned the best ways to work with them.  This may also be
because the chanters I've been grouping with were all in their 20's and didn't
know enough yet to correct me, either. This thread will help a lot as I continue
trying to powerlevel my warrior up to planes-capable status.  Thanks to you guys
for the informative lesson. :-)  I'll stop switching over to the mobs on the
chanter and start looking into this "bulldog vs. tank" thing, which I had also
never heard of until reading this thread.
