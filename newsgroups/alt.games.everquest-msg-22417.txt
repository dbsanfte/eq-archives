: I presume this is the standard way of replying, to assume an air of
: superiority.

: You seem to think that because a word is a noun, that it cannot be used as
: an adjective. You used a dictionary, but it was the wrong tool. What you
: really needed was a basic grasp of grammar.

:
: Nouns used as Adjectives:
: Sometimes nouns can be used as adjectives to define or describe another
: noun.

: Examples:
:      the porch light
:      a house fly

: Perhaps the University of Calgary just can't learn grammar or are just

--- Thank you for using some tools to support your argument.
I agree with the site that nouns can also be used as adjectives as in "Porch
Light",
but in the case of Kitty Cat I would stand by my argument that Kitty is not
an
adjective, it is a synonym.... Kitty is a synonym of Cat and/or Kitten,
hence "Kitty Kat"
is a compound name.

Just like "Human Man", what other kind of men are there?  Non-human Men? It
is repetitive.
What other kinds of Cats are there? Non-kitty Cats?
