You can keep giving your pet any weapons from rusty up to get it to dual 
wield until level 33 - the level 34 pet will dual wield automatically 
without weapons.

I have had the mage summoned 'fists of ixiblat' proc on a level 12 mage 
pet - either blade of walnan or blade of the kedge also procs with level 10+ 
pets (the higher level blade won't, not sure the level cutoff)

I always recommend to start using the mage summoned weps at 29, since below 
that, you can use a big two-hander like a weighty polearm (bazaar for 
10-15pp usually), and have it hit for 60+.
