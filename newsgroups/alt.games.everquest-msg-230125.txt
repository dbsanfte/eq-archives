There is a gnome on both, although on Behemoth you don't escort him around,
just say "I will test the machine" and hail him for a flag after Behemoth
dies.

If you were intending to do the gnome escort, then your raid was going
entirely in the wrong direction.  That one takes place completely outside of
the factory, and shouldn't be going past a ramp or the factory entrance at
all.

And a blown spawn, hopefully.   For almost two months on E'ci, Behemoth was
kept permadead by pickup raids that had no chance of winning (even with 90
people) constantly blowing the spawn.
