And it wouldn't be around if it didn't keep the backwards
compatability.

A modern operating system on a floppy disk? And i don't mean some
command-line bullshit that went out with the 80's. Last I checked
Linux came on like 7 disks or one DVD.

Feeling misty for the ability to throw some interrupts? Pissed that
you can't call the video card port directly and completely bypass the
op sys? :> *shrug* you shouldn't be able to do that for normal
programs.

Sure it is. Just buy yourself a copy of visual C++ and make a DOS
console app.. you can even use the void main() structure for old times
sake. But really.. to make a modern program, simple structured C would
be incredibly cumbersome. You're kind of like the guy lamenting that
he could change anything on his Model T with 2 wrenches and a
screwdriver.

You can keep hoping.. but it aint gonna happen.
