You see, you missed out on one of the beauties of RvR. there is no
reason to wait. sure you might die if you go to the hib or midi
frontier.  but so what.  i recommend everyone goes to the frontiers to
explore it early.  get a minstrel or bard to speed you along and check
it out.  because if they kill you in rvr all you lose is your pride.
sure you might get one shotted by that 48th level archer in the woods.
but big deal, its fun to just go and watch big realm fights, and look
for a target on the edges that perhaps you get to.  take a few wacks
and die for your realm.

it makes a fun diversion.  and you get to see the midi area of effect
spells in action.
