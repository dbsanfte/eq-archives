Yes, you missed it. He said nothing of the sort.

The simple way of explaining it is, that if you
make a claim, it is up to you to substantiate it,
not for others to disprove it. 

Do you really need all the hyperbole to explain
the uselesness of trying to prove a negative?

If you claim there is such a thing as a soul, then
prove it. If you have no proof, and you simply
believe it to be so, then you might want to
mention that as well.

Give an example.

Why do you say science is not willing to say "we
don't know"?

Thats what it says all the time. And, that is the
reason for its success over superstition and blind
faith.

There is no need to stack the deck, when you have
a winning hand.

I don't know if anyone here has proclaimed that, I
certainly wouldn't. I would say "I don't know".

What is being said is that there is no proof that
it exists. That there is just as much evidence for
the existence of the soul, as there is for
fairies, leprechauns or a young earth... and that
is... nil.

Belief and knowledge are mutually exclusive. It is
no accident that religion is based on the former,
and science on the latter.
