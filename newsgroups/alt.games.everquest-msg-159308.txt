So how many people will be buying these now? None I'd wager. Mana
batteries are such a pain in the ass to get since they're sold in
like, 3 zones, and you have to have a toolbox to do the combine in. I
paid 2250pp for mine, and I've heard of people paying a lot more than
I did for an item that was nerfed just about to uselessness.
Considering the same effect is available on at least 3 other items in
the game, I fail to see why this needed to be nerfed.
