Yeah it's a nasty zone.  I was there the other day with a friend to try to
spawn Black Dire.  My friend a 50 shaman, wandered into a room and invis
dropped and he was dead very quickly.  What a stresser to drag him all the
way out, clicking corpse button, making sure invis stayed up and trying to
follow a map all the way through.  UGH.

Anyway, I was planning on just hanging out at the zone line I think they
will be fine there.  The zone is rarely busy on my server so I don't think
we'll get any trains.
