Hi,

I saw someone auctioning a Shimmering Orb a while ago.  In their auction
they said that this item was for the range slot.

But I was under the impression that it was a primary slot item.

Which is it?  I could not find a listing for it on the EQ websites
that I checked.  (EQ prices and Caster's Realm)

I think that it's stats were something like:  AC15 and HP+20

But I thought this item was for the primary slot, or can it be placed in
the range slot somehow?  Am I missing something?

Many Thanks,

 - Mike Dorr
