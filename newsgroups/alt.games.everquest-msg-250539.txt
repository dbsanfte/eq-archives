Nerfed in the sense of taking one of the key elements of the Druid class and
making it for the most part useless.  When I first started a Druid, it was
for the reason of being able to port myself and my friends...as Mary Poppins
said in this thread, "Players need to be able to need other players. Players
need to be able to show off too.  Not much of either is going on anymore."

Why stop with just killing the usefulness of group ports?  How bout a SoE
Scion?  a KEI book?  etc etc...That's more the point I was trying to make.
Yes, the spell still actually works, but what's the point of Circle of ___
if any class level 1 can just click themselves there?
