LD bugs can take SO many forms, the answer may never be known. Also, if
you are fighting at the time of the LD, particularly with pets, all
manner of things can happen. (I've gotten disconnected while *I* was
charmed by a mob and the ensuing hilarity is hard to forget.)

It's not a perfect system, sadly. You got your corpse and your stuff
back, so probably best to call that a job well done and put it behind
you.
