This weekend while shopping in the bazaar I heard people shouting "see
that trader on the roof". Someone had managed, with Levitation i
supposed (grenade jumping is a lost art from my Quake2 days), to get
up on top of the roof. One would assume the person a jackass for
getting to an inaccessible place to set up trader but then I thought
maybe he was doing it and setting up very low prices. He could then
drive prices down without fear of someone actually taking him up on
his cheap wares and buying them. Ahh....if only I still had my grenade
launcher and grapple hook.....I'd pop one underneath him and use the
force to blow him off the roof and onto the ground. I still think
Weapons Factory for quake2 was one of the most fun mods out there.
Loki's Minions capture the flag was a close second.
