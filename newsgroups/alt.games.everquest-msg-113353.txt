as

Didn't know there was something wrong *shrug*

> - A character can no longer trade with an NPC when invisible.  Character
> must turn visible before starting the trade

Might affect quest turn-ins?

> - Invisibility should now remain after a link death

Great...I go LD a lot.

> - Increased the velocity tolerance for the Hide skill.  This may slightly
> improve the functionality of the Evade skill

Don't follow this one...

> - Random frame lag in Guktop and Oasis should be fixed
> - Fixed a pathing bug in Paludal Caverns

Great...found both of these

> - Addressed an issue with an aggressive NPC that appeared outside of the
> Arx Building in Sanctus Seru

Great....now can I get my exp back from the two deaths he caused to my
character =P

> - A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the same
> time

Good deal.

> - /pet attack range has been limited to prevent its use as a targeting
> tool.  Asking pets to attack targets outside the range will generate a
"not
> a legal target" message

Fixed mage tracking <g>

> - Pets will once again tell you who they are attacking by sending its
> master a /tell
> - Pet attack animations should now be working for all pets
> - Made some adjustments to factions to make Beastlords, Druids and Rangers
> (as well as small adjustments for Vah Shir) a little better liked by
> animals (those that don't adhere to a faction)

All good.

> - Teleports arriving in some zones should spread the arrivals out a bit
> more.  Affected zones are Nexus, Skyfire, Emerald Jungle, Butcherblock
> Mountains, South Ro, Greater Faydark, Tox, North Karana, West Commons and
> Lavastorm

Died twice to this bug.

> - Fixed the strange floating NPC bug (seeing NPCs floating in the air
after
> zoning)

It's not just NPC's on my screen....it's PC's and corpses too.

> - Target Nearest NPC (F8 by default) has been fixed.

Great.
