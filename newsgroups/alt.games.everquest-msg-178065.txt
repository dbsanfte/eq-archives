When did this start happening?  When you get kicked what messages does 
it give, if any?  How far out does it kick you, to desktop or just to 
server select or something?  Are there any messages in log files in your 
everquest directory that might be useful?  If you think it might be 
machine related, what are your specs (Windows version, machine type, 
amount of memory and drive space, video card model/memory/driver 
version, sound card info, EQ settings)?  Does this happen with multiple 
characters in multiple zones?  Does it seem to happen when other people 
are zoning in as has been mentioned elsewhere?

If it's since the last patch and you haven't changed anything, then I'd 
say wait a few patches and check chat and Sony's boards to see if anyone 
there is mentioning similar problems.

Oh, and what's v21?
