Why didn't SoE leave the old bazaar alone?  Not only are the new one
like a maze, it can be a freaking long run from one trader to another
and you're more likely to miss out a deal or a bargain due to distance
and teleporters.

One question: did SoE ever get over that 500 seller limit?  When I
checked, it was not much higher than 300, about the average for my
server post WoW.
