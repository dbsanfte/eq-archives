This is a bard we are talking about.  First off, he should be able to 
juggle in the flute so its there as the song he needs it for finishes 
casting, then juggle it back away, with very little chance of losing any 
melee output.

But second of all, this is a bard, so your sentence should have read simply

"You don't do very much damage"

If you're too lazy to juggle, just keep the flute in hand and sing on.
