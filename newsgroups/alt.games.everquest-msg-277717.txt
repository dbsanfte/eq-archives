I remember being told that a good way to improve faction quickly was to heal
someone who was involved in this. That's when i discovered about mobs that
summon...

it was fun tho!

It would be nice if there was an ingame tool for casual raiders that ppl
could access to arrange a raid (including a counter saying "starts in 90
minutes... 89... 88"), describe it, and fix in advance how the loot would be
distributed (like autoloot in eq2 without clicky boxes so it's fast). If
people aren't autolooting perhaps a point system could be used like in ldon,
so casuals still have a chance of buying better than normal gear if they go
on raids?
