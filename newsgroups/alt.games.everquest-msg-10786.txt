    One of my best times to be an evil git.
    I stumble accross a guy who is engaged with three mobs (gnolls, as I
recall, in Qey Hills) and within a sliver of a corpse run.  I do a quick
check and see that he (or others I didn't watch the whole fight) has two of
them under half, and one of them is close.  So I figure the odds of me KSing
all of them are slim, but the odds of saving this guy a corpse run were
high.  So an AOE bomb and a DD later, the guy is standing in a pile of
corpses not his own.
    Turns out I did get one of them for me... it was Green To Me so I didn't
see an exp message, but it was mine to loot.  But the other two were his, or
at least he was able to loot them immediately.
    He turns to me and starts swearing up a storm about KSing.  I explain
that I checked the situation, and that I had saved him the corpse run in my
opinion... he says something about his ability to heal, and that I should
never interrupt a fight and his level 63million uberasskicker will come and
take all my exp forever, and he's going to petition me if I ever do it
again, and some other crap.
    "Fine, it'll never happen again." [dumbass].

    Not 20 minutes later, I'm walking through Qeynos Hills, and lo and
behold, the same guy is fighting the Rabid Grizzly.  At the time, the Grizz
was blue to me.  I do a quick check, he's within about a bubble of a corpse
run, and he has the grizz just under half.
    So I walk down and make sure I'm within dumbass' sight, so he knows I'm
there, sit down. and watch him die.
    With him safely reset on aggro (dead), and the rabid grizz pretty well
below half, I smite it in a single blow, get exp, loot the hide, and go grab
what at the time was about 1/3 - 1/2 yellow bub for the quest.

    I debated sending him a tell to say thank you for the rabid grizz, but
decided that he probably got the point without me rubbing salt in the wound.

    I know I know.  I was young and naive.  He probably still swears at
people who save him corpse runs.
