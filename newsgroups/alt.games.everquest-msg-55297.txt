Hmmm. If it's to the point where a mez or a stun won't do any good, then
nothing that anyone does is going to help. If I can't stun the mobs then
the evac is going to be interrupted, the healer is going to be interrupted
(or more likely die) etc..

The ratings scope is too damn narrow. I define "when the shit hits the
fan" as a point in a fight where the right class doing the right thing can
turn the fan off. A good enchanter will "do the right thing" more often
than not.

/em admits he's never played a bard

I like my mez. It's my job. You try and horn in I'll call the shop steward
on ya! Scab! ;-)

Aye, my best record for a single fight was High Hold Pass at 17. Started
with one, we finished off 8 before the fight was completely over. Everyone
oom, everyone hurt, but happy and grinning with those "would you believe
we all fucking survived that?" grins on their faces.

If not for a stupid &@%*& ranger that wandered by to try and "help" us I'd
have had 7 sleeping at once.

I'll admit I'd reach for an AoE mez at that point. But I'd also waddle in
and start chain-stunning. Stuns have no limit on the number of mobs they
effect. I have two stuns loaded at all times, with a recast overlap of
one tick. Combined with an AoE Mez to open the show I could probably
shut all 8 down for a long long time. (If I can get them all
up-close-n-personal like)

Of course, Mr Murphy will arise and show me my folly with a resist or
two ;-)

And it's just dreamy when the pick-up group you're in has never seen it
done before. ;-) When it works well, the group barely takes a hit and the
cleric never gets off their seat.

When it fails... well. We'll just not talk about that ok?

This may have more to do with the recent modifications to mob MR resists. 
Ie, higher mez/stun resist (or outright immune) but lower overall MR.
