     Wow indeed.  I skimmed this, but then my head started
to explode and I had to stop.   
So let me see if I got this right before my brain threatened
to reach critical mass.  In DAoC,
a guild called BlackSnow has several members banned because
they were caught using exploits. 
Rather than just chalk this up to experience, sign back up
and start over playing right, they've
gotten themselves a lawyer to litigate themselves back into
to the game, probably complete with
some compensation for pain and suffering.  Is this right? 
Did I get it?  
   Personally, I wish them well.  Because I want them to
stay with DAoC, rather then defecting
to some other game.  Like EQ.  Because I don't want them
around me.  Because they make my head
hurt.
