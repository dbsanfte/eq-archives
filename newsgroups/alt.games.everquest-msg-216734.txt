Deleted characters are not overwritten even if someone does start a
character with their name.  If someone had started a character named "zinfa"
and then subsequently deleted it, yours could restore fine.  If someone had
started one and not deleted it, you still could have been restored, but you
would have got the name "zinfax".

This also means that if someone made and deleted a "zinfa" *before* you made
yours, their "zinfa" is out there in the backups.  If your server suffers a
serious failure, requiring complete restoration from backups (which has
happened two or three times over the life of EQ so far), that other "zinfa"
will be restored first, and you will be "zinfax".  When they do a full
restore like this, they just restore all the characters on an account, not
just the (up to) eight that were active.  Yes, this means you can end up
with more than eight characters active on your account.  When that happens,
you only see eight of them.  If those are the eight you want, fine.  If not,
you have to delete the ones you don't want to see, and the hidden ones show
up.

Hmmm...thinking about this, that also means that the following could happen.
Server dies, and is restored.  Someone else's old deleted "zinfa" comes
back.  However, that was not one of their first eight characters, so doesn't
show up on their screen.  The characters they want to play are among the
first eight, so they don't bother deleting anything, so they never even see
the old "zinfa" again, so of course never delete it.  You are "zinfax" (or
"zinfaxx" or worse...).  You can petition now and then to try to get the GMs
to change you to "zinfa", but it never works, because that other "zinfa" has
not been deleted, and never will be, because its owner doesn't even know it
is there.  (And even if it *does* show up on their first eight, they might
not bother to delete it if they don't have any other characters that are
hidden that they want to get back).

Basically, unless they've made some improvements since the last time they
had to do a complete restore, they backup/restore procedure sucks, since it
doesn't actually save everything (it should save what characters are active
and which are deleted).
