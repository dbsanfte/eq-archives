Depends on the mob but usually it doesn't make much difference. There
is one other thing that does make a difference though, Tash has a good
deal of agro associated with it, Malo(s) has pretty much zero agro. 

If an enchanter pulls with tash in tier3, my slow will NOT get agro
off of him.  So for an enchanter to do a quick tash and slow takes a
good knight for agro generation or he waits a while for the tank to
generate agro. A shaman never has to worry about catching agro till
after he's cast slow. 

Admittedly, that doesn't matter in most zones, you're rarely living so
close to the edge that you need shaman slows but from what I've seen,
their advantage in slowing tends to be bigger than just the 5% that's
usually quoted.
