	Er, as a Necro or an SK?  At 22 (when SK get it) yah, I can see it
	not being so hot.  At 12 when necros get it it's a fantastic way to
	save mana on life taps.  Into the 20s it continues to be a very
	good, cheap life tap when one is fear kitting.

	All I'm wondering is if dex improves it like it does normal procs.

	Anyone who says necros don't/can't/shouldn't melee except at the
	very beginning is very mistaken.  Just because you can't tank
	doesn't mean you can't melee, and Vampiric Embrace is the most mana
	efficient method to life tap necros get pretty much the entire game.
