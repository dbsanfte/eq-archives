    Actually, it's not just stupid, it's fucking ludicrous. Especially since
most SK's couldn't give two hoots about their damage output, as compared to
tanking, which is the area we're really getting hurt in. I mean, we care,
but nowhere near as much as a ranger does, considering they're basically a
DPS class.

    Still, I find it really quite surprising - my melee output is only a
portion of my damage, and neither spells nor pet scale much with gear. So
it's really only melee damage that would go up, and rangers+warriors will
benefit from that more than I will. On the other hand OoW has a new pet and
some new spells, so the static edge will grow again.

    I'm pretty farking sure most SK's would happily lose any DPS advantage
for a tanking boost.
