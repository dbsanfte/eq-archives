The staff of temperate flux is probably the most important quest piece for a
Wizard....apart from Journeyman's Boots...and of course the Wizard Epic
quest.

Now first of all this staff does NOT need to be equiped to be used.  It has
no stats so it would be a waste of an equipment slot to do so.  You just
hold the staff in a "general" inventory slot (not in a bag) and setup a
hotkey/button for it.  Then you just right click it whenever you want to use
it.  It has an instant cast effect of "lower element".  Therefore it can be
cast whilst running.  The effect will lower mobs resistances to fire and
cold by 10 points.  It's not that much but it does help.  It's main use
however is in quad kiting.  Having this staff enables a wizard to aggro 4
mobs without ever having to stop to cast a spell on them.  This makes the
aggroing part of quad kiting much easier to do.  It also overwrites most
mob's damage shields...reducing the need to annul or cancel magic on those
such mobs that have the Damage shields.

Now to answer your questions...wait...there is no need...

Goto www.graffe.com and print off the quest walkthrough.  You will either
need to take a full group with you for most parts....or wait until you level
up some more.

As for the lambent stone... check the Inn in Rathe Mountains...normally some
for sale there since people who loot them from HG's sell them to the vendor.
Alternatively try auctioning for one in that zone.

Good luck on this quest....it is well and truly worth it..
