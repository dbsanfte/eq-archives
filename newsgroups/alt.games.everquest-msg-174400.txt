It seems unlikely to me that the packet size is responsible for this
issue.  I was disconnected 5 times on Friday night in 4 hours,
something that has never happened before.  I have DSL and my packet
size was changed to 9 over a year ago.  I also had issues getting to
the character selection screen yesterday.  I logged into the chat room
on EQ and noticed many people were habing technical issues that day.
I'm guessing something happened, maybe not the patch but definitely
something.
