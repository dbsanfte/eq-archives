    The bug was being kept very hush-hush by The Mages That Be, because
they'd figured out how to replicate it at will and had reported it to SOE as
a bug urgently in need of fixing. For Joe Mage, the problem usually
manifested when they were doing pet canni (summon a pet, Reclaim Energy the
pet for more mana than you spent summoning it, repeat to full mana) and
suddenly one pet couldn't be Reclaimed. Or one pet went berserk on the owner
after an attempted Reclaim. Or, as some mages were able to do, you'd Reclaim
the pet, you'd get the mana, but the pet wouldn't actually go away.
Hopefully all the "pet ain't a bet" bugs got killed.

    Ready to laugh at me?

    I don't have a single map loaded on my system, even though I want them.

    I get home from work, rush to make the raid or rack up LDoN points, then
log off late when I'm too tired to do anything else. Even though I really
want them, especially the LDoN maps, I just haven't had a chance to load
them yet.
