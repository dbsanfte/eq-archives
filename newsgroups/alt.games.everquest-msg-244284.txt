Good day-

I went to the safehouse and checked the FAQ- but I still have
questions.

1- can i buy ready made poison- or do I have to make them all myself

2- is this really worth it- is this something i should do to be a
successfull rogue

on a separate note- 
i've been all about piercing up to lvl 20- no 1hnd slash- should I
start using the slash at this point or am i to late.

I love my rogue- i hate my rogue.  At lvl 20 this is my hightest char-
so I'm trying my best.

Thanks again

Armin
