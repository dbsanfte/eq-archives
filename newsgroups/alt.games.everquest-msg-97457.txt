Ok - I have seen multiple posts that indicate that the wizard research
spells are available for purchase in Katta Castellum. Maybe so - but
if the level 29 spells are there, I can't find them. I've been up and
down the tower more times than I can count and hit every vendor more
than once.

I've reached the conclusion that the level 29 research spells aren't
there - though it appears that the 34 - 44th(?) level spells are.

If someone can verify that Shock Spiral or Energy Storm are
purchasable here - I would be greatly appreciative. If you could post
a vendor name or a loc, I'd be ecstatic!

That's what I get for trying to do things the 'easy way' - hehe -
shoulda just stayed home and studied... I'd have em by now!

Turian.
