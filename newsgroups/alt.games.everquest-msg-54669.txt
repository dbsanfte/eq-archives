I guess you have the option to see the message turned off now. You would
have to be some kind of masochist to hate it that much and still have
/inspect on.

Suppose Sony got rid of the /inspect function, but didn't tell you. You may
have to turn it back on, now and again, to make sure that people can still
inspect you, otherwise you will not know whether you should be annoyed or
not.

Wouldn't it be dreadful to have this annoying part of the game resolved to
your satisfaction, and be completely unaware of that fact.
