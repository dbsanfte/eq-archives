In pick-up groups I generally go NBG on No Drop items and "greed" for
droppable.  I do this for many of the reasons stated on both sides of the
argument.  Everyone needs money and just because the tradeable Uber Saff of
Dragon Pummeling (selling for 120K in bazaar) drops does not mean that the
warrior/paladin/SK that can wield it should be the only one that has a
chance to take it.  We all need the cash.  If, however, it is No-Drop,
anyone who does not need it that rolls, should be immediately booted from
the group.  In p-u groups, I may or may not know the others, may never see
them again, and so cannot be assured I will be in the running for the Mega
Spear of Tremendous Power (tradeable) that only a Shaman or Rogue can use,
droppable or the drop spells that sell for 20 to 30K that I need.  With a
chance at the big score, I can sell it in the bazaar and pick up what I
needed.

Is that greedy?  Probably.  I am thinking of myself on this as I don't have
any vested interest in the others in the group, yet.  Is it fair?  Sure.  I
am more than willing to accept that others will do the same thing.  Is it
reasonable to expect others to look out for me when they do not know me?
Hell, no.
