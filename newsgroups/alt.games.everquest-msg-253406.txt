Actually, in content that doesn't just instantly flatten the cloth
caster who draws aggro, a Paladin can do very well as part or even
all of a group's crowd control.  Stuns, Root, fast heals, & group
heals, with LoH available in a panic situation, allow a group with a
Warrior or SK plus a Paladin to be very aggressive in content that
isn't designed to instantly wipe your group for the tiniest error.
Further, Root is a very nice pulling tool, which should come as no
surprise when you consider that Root is mostly used for CC and
pulling is pre-emptive CC.  This gives a smart Paladin quite an
advantage over a Warrior as a puller (outside of content that is
immune to run-speed changes, of course).  Note that Root pulling and
Root CC both rely in part on the Paladin's tanking strength.

"Utility" sucks from a class balance perspective, it is commonly
used as an excuse for gimping a class's strengths, making them less
desirable than others competing for raid slots and also for group
slots in areas of the game where players obsess over efficiency
(i.e. the same thing Warriors faced in PoP because of their "aggro
insufficiency").  But it's great from a playability/fun perspective
when you're with folks who are more interested in having a good time
than in squeezing that last 2% out of their theoretical maximum
xp/hour.

In the context of the game as it is now, I think they should put in a
Warrior mini-defensive to add to Warrior tactical options.  Something
like -10% DI for one minute, with reuse of 2 minutes from last use
(i.e. you could use it half the time, END permitting), no penalty for
use, and END cost just high enough to discourage constant use unless
the content's tough enough that your healer(s) need med breaks anyway.

DOS classes would howl even louder about that than Warriors did about
the idea of a Paladin mini-Defensive to deal with GoD tanking issues.

Warriors have rejected similar proposals repeatedly.

I don't think you realize just how reactionary, self-centered, and
short-sighted the various EQ class communities are.  Everybody's
got their set of "sacred cows" that trigger huge flaming shitfests
whenever they are questioned by anybody, inside or outside the
community.  Look at the PoN class balance forum to see what happens
when it is suggested that stun mechanics ought to be changed.  I
believe that the main reason SOE is so tentative about addressing
class balance issues is not that it's so easy to screw things up
even worse than they are, but because proposiing any substantive
change will produce a huge volume of flak from outraged morons (and
they care about the morons, their $13 is just as real as anybody's),
and be resisted so strongly that it takes many months to find out
what the net effect of the change set is.

FWIW, your suggestions would make Warriors play much more the way I
think they ought to:  as armored engines of destruction crashing
into the midst of their enemies at the head of their allies.  I hate
EQ's obsession with boss mobs and huge raids and crowd control.
Acting as the "focus" for a crowd of casters' magical energies is
not my idea of "tanking", mechanically slaughtering hapless mobs
held paralyzed until their turn to die is stupid, lame, and pathetic.
