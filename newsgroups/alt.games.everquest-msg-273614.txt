You mean other than lying to the guild leader and pressuring to have
the application process changed for him so he could hide an unpleasant
past? I'll bet you that had the child been honest about his past and
displayed a capability and willingness to act civil, he wouldn't have
been removed. But he lied. To the guild leader. That alone is enough
to get you removed from most guilds, and god damned rightfully so.
