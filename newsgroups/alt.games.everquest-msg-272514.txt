I'm amazed. Stalk gives 0 aggro. All you need to do is stand behind
a group member when you hit it - as far as I can see, its the near
perfect pulling tool. It doesnt refresh often enough for fast grinding,
but for pulling nameds, etc, I cant see why you wouldn't use it.

Sure - but with stalk all you do is make sure the warrior hits it first,
or stands nearest - it'll go right ot them. Puller isn't equivilant to
'tank' or 'aggro holder', which is what you're describing.
