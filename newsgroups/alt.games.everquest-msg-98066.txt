But isn't that 'impact' just all in your mind?

Can we even quantify how much of these or future changes will
cheapen the game effort of getting to 60?

Why because you have a life and didn't spend 16 hours a day
powerleveling?

I saw a guild memeber level his twink monk to 50 in 4 days played time.
4 fucking days! You know that was all spent powerleveling.
What kind of achievement is that? All he did was go from grind spot
to grind spot. Doesn't seem like fun to me just endless drudgery.
But, whatever floats your boat, obviously he must have got some
enjoyment out of it.

Getting to level 60 is nothing. Its very easy if that's all you want to
do. It is NOT any kind of achievement at all. There are plenty
of guides out there how to powerlevel and grind away to your
hearts content.

>This will make it less fun for me.

How so? How does what someone else does affect how you enjoy
the game? Do you play single player games and get disappointed
when you got a lower score or finished the game slower than someone
else? Does that ruin your fun or your experience of playing the game?

Fair enough. But is your challenge of leveling fun in and of itself?
Do you go from grind spot to grind spot just endlessly killing the
same mobs over and over? Or do you adventure, quest, travel
and kill things all across norrath?

For me the journey is the adventure not the destination.

Getting to 60 is great and all but then what? More loot and
AA levels? Ok, then what?

False premise because you can't cause as much grief in EQ as you can in
the quake games. For one its not a PvP game on the vast majority of the
blue servers and its against the rules to cause grief in any case.

I do not the think even if you made the game a cakewalk it would add that
many more people that are asses. Many of those people already tried EQ
when it first came out and are probably off causing grief in one of the new
games.

Yes. I think we are arguing degree here.

Easier? Sure. But easier to the detriment of the game or to my enjoyment?
Nope no way.
