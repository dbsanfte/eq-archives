And someday maybe my Iksar will be able to talk to a Bard without
getting killed, and I'll try that quest. :)  I'm "kindly" in both
Qeynos and Kaladim at this point, but I still have to watch out for
Bards in those cities.  (And for Wizards of the "Order of Three".)

Well, assuming you set it up so that a KOS character can get the
faction-adjusting container in the first place, I know what I'd do:
I'd get the container, then ignore the mail quest for a while, and
use the faction adjustment to do some simpler bard-related quests!
