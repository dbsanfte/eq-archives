They do on yours or so you say.  Quoting you:

"Every name I see that violates the rules of the game offends
me. By definition."

Those character's names -- by *your* definition -- offend you.
I'm surprised you can stand to play at all when every time you
log on you're offended.

You're not going to trot out the "they only offend me so it's not
important" excuse, are you?   You petition others for offending
you.  Like I said, there's a term for people like that.
