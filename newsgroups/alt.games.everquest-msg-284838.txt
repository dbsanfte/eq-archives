I assume the new AAs are levels 71-75.  Are there any new AAs for
lower levels?  So far I haven't seen anything to tempt me into
buying this expansion.

On the other hand, I can really get behind many of the "general
game improvements", especially the out-of-combat resting (yes!
it does include endurance!) and faster AAXP at lower levels.

Oi!  I understand why they did that, but still, why not add a new color
like purple for the "dark blue" range?  Their way, how long is it going
to take for everyone to get used to the fact that "green" no longer means
"no xp and quite possibly trivial", etc.?  Heck, most people still use
"no drop" and "no rent" instead of the new terms, and that's been how
many months?

I'm going to have to scour the FAQ for all references to the colors, and
explain the terminology carefully somewhere.

This is a wonderful idea!  Too often, the choice is between making the
group leader be someone who already has some useful leadership abilities,
vs letting someone else be leader so they can acquire the abilities too.
Now you can have the abilities and let someone else build up points.

Do the in-game spell descriptions mention what the caps are?  Or do
we have to look at Lucy?

Interesting.  I wonder if this is avoid having guard aggro interfere
with players achieving the "resting state"?

This is undoing an earlier nerf, right?  Or more likely just partially
undoing it.  I.e., it sounds like they still won't do their full damage,
but it'll be higher than the 25% or whatever it was they got nerfed to.

> - Translocate spells no longer require a reagent.

Grr.  At some point I bought a stack of Small Portal Fragments for my
Wizard even though he doesn't have any of those spells yet, because I
figured I'd need them someday and I didn't want to have to remember to
buy them when I got that far.  Oh well, I wonder if they have much
sellback value?  And do NPC vendors still sell the now-useless SPFs?

Yeah, that was a sort of clunky mechanism that really didn't add much
role-play or anything.

> - Race based experience penalties have been removed.

Yeah, I think the reasoning was something like, races that benefit
from extra regen aren't getting as good a deal any more because of the
out-of-combat stuff, so just let them have full xp, and the frontal
stun resist for ogres sort of gets a free ride.  My iksar certainly
won't object. :-)

Uh, okay, so what's the downside?  Or should everyone just turn this on?
