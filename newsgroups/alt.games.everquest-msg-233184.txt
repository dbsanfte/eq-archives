Same. Petitioned and got the same response. However, I recently bumped
into a player who was working on the Satchel of Abu-Kar upgrade quest
(saw the dialogue on my screen) and asked if he had purchased LDoN
recently. He said yes and I then asked if he had problems /claim-ing
the reward. That he did too and he petitioned and a GM DID summon a
bag for him. Interesting... is there a priority list or something?
