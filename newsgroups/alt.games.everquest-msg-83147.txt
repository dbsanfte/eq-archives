While I agree those are 'fun' names, I hardly think that JRRT had any
sexual possibilities in mind when he chose them.

Which is commendable. It is also possible, with just a modicum of
creativity, to do so and yet remain within the boundaries of the
naming rules.

Someone who reports a name violation is not asserting their own
morality. For that to be the case, the petitioner would have to
actually have the power to enforce the game rules - but she does not.
Instead, the petitioner merely brings violations to the attention of
the people who operate the game, and *they* are the ones who determine
and assert their morality.

If someone wants to have fun within the game, it is quite possible to
do so without violating the naming rules.
