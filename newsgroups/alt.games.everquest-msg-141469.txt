Sorry, you can't heal mobs.  You can spend the mana, and get the
messages, but the mob's HP will not go up.

Best method I found to raise archery (for a warrior) was to find a
druid who wanted tailoring components, fletch as many arrows as can
be carried, and bow kite with a little help from the druid while she
spends most of her time/mana killing her own mobs (let the druid have
the tailoring drops you get in exchange for the spells she's using to
help you kill).

OTOH, if you're a paladin, don't bother.  Archery caps at 75, so you'll
never use it again once you find a range slot item with any benefit at
all.  It used to be that archery had some use up to L30 for pulling,
but with the Luclin era stun spells (Cease for 15 mana at L9 is a great
spell) there is no reason at all for a paladin ever to use a bow once
he has spells.
