At your level? I've not started up any chars that begin in Qyenos area so
I say this in total ignorance of the newbie gardens and nearby
zones... there may be something better closer to you that I don't know
about. That being said...

Head to the commons. West Commons would probably be best. It's the Wall
Mart zone for tailoring - a one stop buffet for tailoring supplies.

Spiderlings, Large Spiders, Giant Spiders, Lionesses, Lions, Black Wolves,
Shadow Wolves, Black Bears and Young Kodiaks all in one zone, and all
green or at worst low blue to you (Kodiaks, Giant Spiders and Lions being
the only possible blues to you at 10)

IMHO there is no better zone to be in if you're farming tailoring
supplies.
