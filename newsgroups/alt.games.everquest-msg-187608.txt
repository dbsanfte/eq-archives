Until recently, ALL servers were physically located in West Coast USA.

Then there was Antonius Bayle (physically in UK) and Kane Bayle
(physically in Europe) which are still US time-zone servers. Antonius
Bayle is the one that most UK players were advised to play.

Recently 3 more UK and Europe servers were added (I think Venril
Sathir is the UK one) which were physically and language located in
England, France and Germany. I may have the exact details wrong -
someone will correct me. These servers are also run on a local
timezone too. I do not know how this will affect patch times and GM
events etc.

I would advise you create chars on Antonius Bayle or the Venril Sathir
one of you have access to it.

Ping times to US servers via broadband range from 200ms+, to the UK
servers, 40ms+ (much less lag)
