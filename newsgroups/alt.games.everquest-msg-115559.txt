Actually this part of the conversation was, at least in my mind, focused on
exp groups, not raids.

And you usually end up doing CR anyways the first couple tries...

Agreed, kind of like idiot clerics who abuse clicking privelege and rez
people mid fight, only to have them die again from rampage.

I'm fairly sure this falls into the "AoEs or does funky knockback shit"
category...

Approximately 50, mostly miscellaneous Kael (no Tormax/AoW/statue/Vindi), a
few CoM, one that was scouting only in PoG (couldn't take faction hit), one
somewhere else that I don't remember anything about due to the caffeine
pills I was taking to stay awake, I think there were dark elves though.

Yes, assuming I had killed any of these things, had I been a melee of any
sort, I probably would get everyone killed in some gruesome way.  Hell, I
probably would die myself as a druid the first time I killed one/any of
those just by doing some "stupid newbie trick" that everyone else knew not
to do, such as one of my mage friend's first time on Vindi and somebody
pulled Vindi before all the clerics were there, and that was the first of 4
wipeouts that night (they did off Vindi eventually though, but according to
one of the corpses in the Nexus that I talked to, it was "Gimp ass noob
work").

Oh, and usually the monks do the positioning in my experience, and then yell
at everybody else to push them in a certain direction.

I'm not really sure how this conversation got routed into a metric assload
of raid mobs, I was mostly thinking of exp groups initially, I wouldn't play
a warrior on a raid with minimum/barely adequate forces anyways, I'm
confident enough that that is a bad idea, since something inevitably goes
wrong in some way/shape/form and people die en masse.

Then again, I don't run around dungeons looking for "pretty colours" like
the real warrior does.  (I'm serious, I asked him why he ran around PoH like
a chicken with it's head cut off at one point and he said, "to find pretty
colours")
