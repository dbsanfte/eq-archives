Everyone is not level 70. I have been playing for 4 years and the
highest i have is 55 (the old destination vs journey discussion). I see
other people who never played joining up (not like the old days but
they keep coming). If sony were to focus on only 65+ raiding guild
players, then EQ is on its way out.
