Bringing AoE groups into a description of why soloing always give
better exp seems a little... odd. AoE group != soloing. Anyway...

Melee-heavy groups with a healer will generally do better than the same
group with all members soloing. Even with the most minimal group,
warrior+cleric, you cut downtime from HP regeneration enormously. Pile on
more melees and you increase DPS disproportionately. That's the basic
reason for the way exp groups form the way they do.

Damage avoidance or mitigation is not always as straightforward as you
seem to be saying. Your soloing examples cover two of the most efficient
solo setups in the game. You don't mention the cleric who must root &
nuke (and heal when root breaks). Nor the melees who must bandage and/or
sit around regnerating hit points.
