Hallaleuha brother
Last pickup group I joined the main tank told me in group : have this this
this this this this this this this and this memed at all times
10 spells
And mind you he left out clarity
They wern't bad spells mind you (haste, slow, mez, stun, stun, root,
cripple, mem blur, boon, tash, if I remember right), just a bit much for one
little enchanter
