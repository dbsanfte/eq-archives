Well, if it is the frustration thing, maybe it's got him so wound up that
he assumes it's something everyone will intuitivly know.  If I say the
IRS sucks, most will assume I'm refering to taxes.  If I say that what
happened to America, most will assume I mean the the events of
Sept 11.  If I say that 'Beam me up', most will know it from
Star Trek.  So maybe, just maybe, this guy assumes we all know
he's talking about the stackable items numers being pink.
