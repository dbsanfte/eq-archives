CT is also good for paineel (erudites), but its only one faction (heretics),
and its real easy to fix in warrens.
You'll be kos in Cabilis whether you worship CT or not. Worshipping CT will
lessen how much your kos, but who goes to cabilis anyway? Maybe some people
were kos to all of kunark, but with the pok portals that doesnt matter
anymore.
Id choose agnostic, if its an option for your class. That way you can be
wolf formed/project illusioned for faction in many places, and it will
lessen the amount you are kos for some. Save time if you ever decide to fix
your faction.
