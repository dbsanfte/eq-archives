I've played a tank, and a ranger now, both only to late 20's but this is
what I've found.

You generate the most agro for hitting fast, rarther than hitting hard. So
fast 1-hand weapons on the tank are good,
    slow 1-handers/2-handers are better for you. This assumes your about the
same level as your tank.
Distance to the mob plays a large part, make sure the tank stands right in
the mobs face, and you stand as far away as you can.
Make sure the tank only taunts when he loses agro.
NEVER root, unless your bow kiting.
NEVER snare things that dont run, unless your fear kiting.
Only snare things that do run just before they break.

Any thing I've missed, anything I've put wrong?

Andy.
