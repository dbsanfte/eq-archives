It could very well be that Blizzard fans in general (I'm among them)
will flock to WoW.  Many of those Blizzard fans may be Battle.net
users (I'm not: I love playing StarCraft and loved playing Diablo II,
but typically disliked the personalities I found on Battle.net).

I still play StarCraft (LAN games only: please don't tell Blizzard
that copies of FSGS are still floating around) and Diablo II (for
nostalgic reasons mostly: single player only).

The question is: how many non-Battle.net Blizzard fans are there
compared to Battle.net-using Blizzard fans?  And of those
Battle.net-using Blizzard fans, how many of them will pay for a
monthly subscription?  And of those, how many will stick around when
it's clear Blizzard intends to crack down on griefers (at least, I
hope they will)?  And will there be non-PvP servers, and will griefers
even bother with those?

Too many unknowns.  It's too early to draw any decent conclusions on
what caliber of people we'll see in WoW (in my opinion).  Having
played online RPGs for over two decades, I can only hope Blizzard has
some non-PvP servers.  I've never cared for PvP in my ORPGs.

I actually *do* hope WoW will have some PvP servers as well.  I tried
out the EverQuest server Rallos Zek for a while, and while I'm sure
many, many of the people were wonderful, I ran into plenty of
assholes.  Having a few PvP servers may just be an excellent way to
ensure your non-PvP servers have a higher caliber of people
playing.  The PvP servers may attract more...undesirables.  (Or those
just after that kind of challenge.  I want to make it clear I'm sure
there's plenty of nice pro-PvP players too.)

God damn, that's well articulated, and I agree with your well thought
out conclusions entirely.

Blizzard, if you're listening: make sure you come down on griefers and
exploiters FUCKING HARD.  At the end of the day, it'll benefit your
bottom line.

Bob knows what the fuck he's talking about here.  :)
