People seem to have very different results with cable modems.  One 
friend had a horrible time.  When he called the cable company they were 
able to improve things, partly by cleaning up wiring problems and moving 
his cable modem farther from a UPS.  He still has good and bad days 
though.

If it happens more at certain times of the day it could be due to high 
network traffic in your neighborhood.  Otherwise check your local wiring 
for obvious problems or sources of interference, then call your cable 
company.

If nothing you try works, you might want to consider going back to 
dialup or keeping a dialup around for bad days.  I have stayed on dialup 
while most friends went to cable.  I zone slowly, but they sometimes 
have me lead the group because I get disconnected less and have less lag.

Seems to me that latency is more important than bandwidth for Everquest. 
  This might be an interesting read if you haven't seen it before:
