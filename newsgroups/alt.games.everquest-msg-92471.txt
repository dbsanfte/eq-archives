Not quite.

Think of skills as being 2 types... 'targetable' and 'non-targetable'.

Non-targetable includes stuff like Foraging, Sense Heading and Swimming.

'Targetable' skills include combat, casting, Disarm, Pickpocket, Begging,
etc...

If something is 'used up' by the skill (mana, arrows, throwing daggers)...
then it can be raised by targetting anything... even greenies.

If the skill doesn't consume something (combat skills, Pickpocket, Instill
Doubt) then it needs a 'blue' or higher to advance it.

Only 'combat skills' I can think of that can be raised on greenies are
Archery and Thrown Weapons... because you're expending ammo.

Yeah, yeah... I know you can raise Begging on greenies with no
expenditure... you expect Verant to be 100% consistent?? :o)
