    It's cheap enough that you should be able to do it on an alt, except I
THINK (cannot remember) that the one piece of the brew he'll want you to
make is a No Drop item in Siren's Grotto. Somehow I don't see a level 1
looting that. ;-)

    Brewing 189, AT 1. I once accidentally right-clicked on one of my
creations when trying to move it. :-/ It was funny, too - the entire rest of
my first guild were all racing to see who could be the biggest drunkard.
Fond first memories of EQ - Homarth nearly drowning in Rivervale during his
drunken swim, having Homarth auto-follow me through GFay as he was too drunk
in RL to get to Kelethin, Homarth being the first to 200 AT in the guild...
hmm, I think I'm seeing a pattern here. Now I know why instead of calling
him the "Dark Knight of Kaladim" when he completed his Bloodforge set we
called him the "Drunk Knight of Kaladim".
