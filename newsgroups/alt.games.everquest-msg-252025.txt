Remember the day when you didn't have to be level 65 to be cool?  When
you could sit around exploring GFAY or ECOMMONS and be amazed at the
atmosphere?  Remember when you could travel to the frozen barbarian
homeland and feel like you're really going on a dangerous trek?
Remember when you went through halfling town and head the little music
and saw the arcitecture and the mood and felt like you were really
THERE?

Now days EQ is too elietist.. thats why I'm looking forward to EQII--A
fresh start?

Does anyone agree?
