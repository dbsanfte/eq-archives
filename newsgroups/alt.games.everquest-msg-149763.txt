That's around the time warriors start getting their disciplines, and
they keep getting them periodically till the end game. You can look them
up on Caster's Realm at your leisure. Some are great, some are nearly
useless, but you get them.

The "skills" are the basics of the class. You should have mastered the
basics by  then, prior to marching into the end game.
