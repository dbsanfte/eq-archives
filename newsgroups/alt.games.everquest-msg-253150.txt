Personally, I think its scarier that he pretended to be female for 
multiple years.

I can *almost* understand how faking ones death might appear to be funny 
while drunk. (But even if we forgive his stupidity while drunk... 
letting 'the joke' drag on after he sobered back up is inexcusable.)

One sick fuck.

I often wonder if EQ wouldn't be a better place if people weren't so 
anonymous.
