There should be a way to bypass the lower levels completly.  Maybe
trade some of your higher level chars xp to start a char at lvl 20.
And before anyone says anything, I know your skills will not be high,
but they could fix that too.  I know they never ever ever will allow
this, but still.  They also said they would never take away the
spellbook to med, and that CR was part of being a newbie. Like you
said, killing rats gets old pretty fast
