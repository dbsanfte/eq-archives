I use this, at level 33, and have managed a 176 point backstab out of it.
I paid 600 plat for it (I don't have luclin) and consider it a solid
choice for the cash strapped rogue. Damage is 12/29 and yes, it is
absurdly light. Looks silly too. Also has the disadvantage of not being
magic, you'll want another magic piercer around.

Looks pretty average to me. I've seen Spine Chill Spear or the better
Slime Coated Harpoon being used, cost 500 - 800 plat for 10 damage 25'ish
delay.

Decent ratio, but lame damage = small backstabs. As to the mods on the
weapons...who cares? none of them are sizable enough to matter. 

Though doing so much damage at low level is going to get you bashed
around a lot :)

Buy some player made barding. Light weight, especially if you can wear
small size, common and cheap.

The weapon is piercing, fine with duel wield. As far as I can see 2 handed
piercing simply means "this weapon does too much damage for a rogue to be
able to backstab with it". Note that all the big damage piercers are not
rogue usable.

The only measure that matters is damage over time. Which is largely 
measured by the ratio of damage to delay. In other words high damage
and fast speed. However a rogue also wants damage for big backstabs,
so ratio is a little less important.

But, in my experience, anything with a really good ratio costs insane
amounts of money.
