I think you missed the part where I said,  "casual." Just because you
are high level does not mean you are joe optimizer with all the tools
and the outlet to optimize the most. EQ has been out for TWO YEARS.
Even a VERY casual player could have got a character to 50 or more in
that time. 

Its not as simple as "powerlevel someone for that item." Everyone does
not play with many other people they can just pull out of their
virtual ass to solve trivial combat code problems. Its also NOT just
about wanting loot, its the fact that NO QUEST in luclin will be free
of the trivial combat code. The casual player is not going to be
chasing down newbies to powerlevel on mobs so he can get drops to do
Tony the Tiger faction improving quests, that is ridiculous. 

What I'm saying is that he is probably not even going to know that he
will be so limited and the box WON'T SAY IT. You can pretty much bet
that it won't. 

I'd say there is a better feeling than walking into a zone and feeling
safe and secure, walking into a zone and feeling like you can actually
do something there.


>The no drop items is what limits item distribution big time, not TCC rules.

Wasn't talking about distribution, was talking about freedom. The
freedom to do quests or to get piddly things if you wanted to while no
one else is anyway. Verant tries to paint the same picture that many
Pro trivial loot code people do, that the world is crowded with
shoulder to shoulder players all in competition to kill this rat over
here for this quests. It isn't. More often than not my druid can still
find itself mostly alone off in a corner of a zone not competiting or
interfering with no one. I mean now we have kunark, Velious, old eq
AND soon luclin. Thats a lot of real estate to roam around in. Since
there are tons of quests and faction rasing to do in areas which are
not super magnet areas I never feel like I'm tripping over people, do
you? It will bother me to be in 5 empty zones at 3 am though and have
to try to dig up a newbie to experience some quest content, once again
I don't have the resources to pull one out of my ass at such times.

I don't see that as the problem even, more the lack of freedom to do
quests or to get the often no drop TCC items.

I don't think it will be and would like to know what you base that on.
Many people are not jewel crafters and have given up on trades (which
are just more downtime, camping and carpal tunnel) so such things are
of no interest to them. Luclin will have a couple planes but otherwise
is mainly lower areas from what I've heard.

With only one character though it would be even harder to get around
trivial loot code and to enjoy new content. To me its removing
something you could always do for fun for no real reason at all since
for the most part no problem existed previously. Creating a big giant
problem for nearly everyone in a whole new add on while previously
virtually none existed makes no sense.
