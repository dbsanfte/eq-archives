Free *WORLD*? Since when? Country, maybe, but those freedoms only
apply to the government. Your ISP/news host can censor what you say
all they want...

At any rate, you may be free to post it, but we're just as free to
tell us exactly what we say about it. Frankly, YOU are the one here
trying to censor people...
