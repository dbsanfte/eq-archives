I didnt attack you personally. Just pointed out that many of the beefs
you have with MMORPG's are not only with EQ but exist with all online
offerings.

See my response to EMPTY in this thread regarding the buisiness of
MMORPS in general and why its good if SOE makes bucks on this.

I dont get the parallel of the drug dealer and sony (besides the
obvious statement that both offer addicting substances =p). A drug
dealer is doing business illegally, and SOE is doing it legally.

And yes, the money that they make creating expansions is a motivation.
Isnt that a good thing?

You question SOE's ethics on their advertisements. I agree they can be
annoying, but its far from being unethical. Being ethical is
conforming to accepted standards of social or professional behavior.
Its not ethical to advertise ones wares? Annoying... yes. If they flat
out charged your credit card without your consent, THAT would be
unethical (in my opinion).
