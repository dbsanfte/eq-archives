/rant on

So, here we are in PC enjoying ourselves when a couple of other people rock
up (a high level character PL'ing someone) and decide to camp there too...no
complaints about that until they start shouting KS and get their guild in on
it.....
Alot of *unkind* chat went down with the the other people dragging a guild
member of theirs into the affair (who then went on to KS & train the part we
were on!)..
Is there much you can do about this?
Is it normal for people to get so cranky they threaten to KS everything
anytime they see you are on?

/rant off

I feel sooo much better now...
