I'll post about the actual event next, but yesterday when a bunch of us
created PvP gnomes on the Zeb server we were not actually PKable.

What I mean is, my level 1 red gnome wasn't able to walk up to another level
1 red gnome and hit Autoattack and take even one swing.  We were all rogues
and warriors so I wasn't able to test spell casting.

Yes, I reported it.  And it's not like it's especially important (the even
being a race, not combat) but figured y'all might find it interesting.
