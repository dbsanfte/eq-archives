Yeah... wait until level 56 when you're making so much damn money you wont
know what to do with it all.  Level... level... level..   If all you want is
PP off the bat, then go ebay yourself some.  If you can wait for PP, go
level.  Once you hit, ohh, say places like Sebilis, when you are collecting
10k worth of gems per 6 hour night and only spending about 2k on peridots,
you'll be rich soon enough.  When you are selling off 96 percent rezzes for
200pp+ most times in those certain "soloing" type zones, you'll be rich soon
enough.

Any questions?
