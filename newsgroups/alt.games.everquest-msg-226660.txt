For those that do not know this, the Bracer of Blood Rage causes
graphics problems with the armor of some races.  On my Vah Shir, it
caused my pants, shoes, bracers, gloves, and head item to show as if I
had nothing in those slots.  Here is how I fixed this problem:

First, I took off the Bracer of Blood Rage and I put it back in the
bank until the programmers can fix it.  I then put my old bracer back
on.

I switched my facial features and then zoned.   After zoning, my armor
looked like it was supposed to and then I switched my facial feature
back to the way it was.  

Problem solved and reported.  Hopefully they will fix this soon.
