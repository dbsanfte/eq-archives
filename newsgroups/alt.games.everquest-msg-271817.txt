Pulling is any kind of attack, such as throwing a stone in your case,
shooting an arrow, etc., (or casting a harmful spell if you're a magic
user) to start a fight with the mob, then you run to whatever spot you
want to fight and the mob will chase after you (and of course, even if
you throw a stone and miss the mob, it still sees it as an act of
aggression and will still chase after you).  A puller for a group will
go off on their own to find a mob to fight, attack it, then bring it
back to where the rest of the group is.  I thought the Grouping 101
FAQ did mention it somewhere.
