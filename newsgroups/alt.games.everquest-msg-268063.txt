Depends on your definition of "take forever," I would assume.  I did 90% of my
wood elf warrior's crafting from one night's gathering.   I had an instance of
a newbie zone all to myself and filled up backpack after backpack of all
manner of raw materials.  By the end I was not only able to gather all tier 2,
but also had the supplies to craft into tier 2 area.  (and still had stacks
left over.)

It was bad during the first few weeks, but now the crush has let up a great
deal.   The tier 1 zones are emptying out, so you don't have to compete with
30 players who will click on anything that highlights, then say "wtf, all I
got was 'no-value' metal from this rock?  maybe that rock there has uber gear
under it."  And gathering was never bad once you got to tier 2, where the
minimum gathering skill requirements stop the aforementioned behavior.

So don't.   I wouldn't ever recommend anyone get into tradeskills for any
reason other than "I enjoy doing it."

*shrug*  Some people say the same about adventuring, that camping your foozle
for the widget of doom becomes like a job.   It's all about doing what you
enjoy.   I happen to enjoy making nice things with tradeskills.   If you truly
enjoy your "job" then what it it that makes doing that "work" a non-fun thing?

For the most part, it does seem that way.  Personally I think it's the thing
they got closest to "right".   (1)

I very much doubt it.   The game isn't EQ1, but I can't see them deviating too
far from the idea that boss monsters and hard quests should have the best
loot.   And a significant portion of (especially the dropped) equipment
appears to be tradeable or at least attuneable.  Instead of crafting an armor
upgrade for a slot, you would just kill to get a nice item... then either wear
the nice item and repeat until all slots are full of nice stuff...  or sell
that item and use the proceeds to buy 3 or 4 player made tradeskill pieces.

(1).  The only semi-complaint with tradeskills seems to be... they're so fun
that everyone is doing them!  There's not going to be much of a market if
everyone either can produce their own gear or knows a friend that can do the
combine for them.   But for the most part, I'm starting to think that "fun"
and "meaningful tradeskill economy" may be mutually exclusive.   That it's a
continuum with each of those options at one end of its spectrum.

I say that I think EQ2 got this closest to "right" because if I had to choose
between those two options, I'd come down pretty close to the "fun" end, if not
all the way there.  Making a bunch of items that I can use myself as upgrades,
but can't sell, that were fun to make, sounds *much* better than "suffering
through hours of pain and tedium so I can do something which isn't really fun,
but gets me a ton of in-game currency, which I can presumably use to buy
upgrades that I will have fun with."
