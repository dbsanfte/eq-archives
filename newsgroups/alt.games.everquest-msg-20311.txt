    Oh, I have wanted to rant about this for SOOOOO long, and here's my
excuse!

    First, as to how they get in: look on the web site of the second guild.
There's usually at least one message from the person, asking to get in. It
will be filled with generalities about how good this guild is, and how bad
their last guild was. The classy players don't do the latter, although it
helps them explain away why they want to leave their current guild. They
then raid/group with the new guild for a bit, and if they don't screw up,
get in.

    See anything in there about reputation? Nope, because there isn't. So
many of the higher-level guilds (at least on my server) are desperate for
members that they'll take anyone that doesn't screw up around them and who
hasn't done anything to them or a friend of theirs. Especially if they're of
a "required raid class".

    For example, on my server a level 60 WAR with a ROTTEN reputation
recently got into the top power guild on the server. By rotten, I mean when
I mentioned his name to friends of mine with no character higher than 30
THEY hated him for training them once. And stupid, too - went AFK underwater
with only EB up, wondered how he'd drowned when he got back. So I asked one
of the guild's members once, "WTF were you thinking?" His response:

    "Well, at first we had him along as sort of a joke - you know, he'd
never get in. But he did everything we told him to do, and he showed up to
every raid. And we needed another WAR...."

    So why get all riled up over one dork getting into a top guild? Because
it isn't just one dork. This guild, which despite being very power-gamer
oriented had some very generous people in it ( <----- not meant as flame
bait ), is earning an awful reputation again. And it isn't based on what the
guild as a whole has done, it's based on what these people have done, and
guilt by association. And when people who have done nothing wrong start
getting trash talked by people they don't even know, they retreat to the one
group that accepts them: the guild. End result? Top guilds with an extreme
"me vs. the world" attitude.

    What has this guild done that results from a bunker mentality? Well, for
one they've started taking down boss mobs as they pop without coming to an
agreement with the other top guilds, as they've done in the past. They
extended one raid session to 5 am their time to make sure that Cazic Thule
got bagged, too. Interactions with others during XP sessions are also bad -
they won't be polite about camp rights as they would in the past (taking
camps from groups on CR, taking camps from groups at zone looking for one
replacement, etc.) All correct and legit by the PnP, but VERY much adhering
to the letter of the PnP.

    I used to see members of this guild group outside the guild. Not any
more. In addition, when they go to /auction or get back lost XP now I see
they frequently /guildremove, and re-join when raids start again the next
day. Just to try and duck the rep they're building.

    And the problem is going to get worse. On my server, this will be the
"summer of 60" - all the kids still in school have the time to play and play
until they hit 60, and become "useful". Some of these people really need
time to mature - but they are level 60, and on my server that's still
something special. So they will be picked up willy-nilly by the top guilds,
without a thought as to what the consequences will be. And there will be
consequences - in September, when school starts again and all these 24-7
players are suddenly nowhere to be found on raid days. And the top guilds
will be left with a lot of holes to plug, and nobody who cares about
reputation willing to fill them. And that's when relations at the top (due
to be strained in SoL ANYWAYS) will really take a nose dive.
