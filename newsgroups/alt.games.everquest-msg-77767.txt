My understanding is that Dex enhances your chances of getting a skill
increase, but has no effect on your chance of success with a combine.  The
best of your INT/WIS is used as the primary stat for determining skill
increases, and then some (maybe all) trade skills have a secondary stat that
helps to raise the chance of a skill increase.  I don't know the details of
how much, or if a minimum level is required in the secondary skill.  Dex is
for Fletching and Tailoring I believe.  STR is used in the same manner for
smithing.  Of course, I could be completely wrong too.
