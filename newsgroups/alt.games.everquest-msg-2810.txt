Or Fire Opal jewellery. Ive seen Plat rings going fairly cheap now. JBands
are good though.

Get something with better AC if you can. Even a Fine Plate neck if you cant
stretch to Seb Scale/RyGorr.

>Face; Plat Ruby veil or Silver Ruby veil  +7str/wis or +4str/wis  (the plat

I'd always pick a mask with AC over this rubbish. Sarnak Hide, Larrikan's,
Fine Plate, Seb Scale. There are lots of options.

Strawspun Belt ;)

Velium is the best of the options listed here. If you're using a shield AC
is your primary concern.

As a tank class your primary overriding concern should be for AC.
Stat-boosting stuff is a far distant second. Even as a spell-casting Hybrid
this is true. Your spells are for backup and there is never a situation
where you should sacrifice AC for WIS ;)
