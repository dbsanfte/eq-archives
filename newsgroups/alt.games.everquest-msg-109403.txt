Start on time for who?   Im in Europe, my server is in the US, my guild is
predominetly Americans.

We do raids in the daytime (early EST)  such as ST, VS, Trak, PoH demis,
Va'dynn etc.. but the big raids (nToV, Lord Yeli, Kael bosses etc) don't
start till about 7pm est, and thats midnight my time already.

The raids I specifically mentioned (PoH and chardok) weren't even my
guild... PoH was when I was unguilded, a pickup raid (and my first PoH raid)
and we just seemed to go on and on, I didn't wanna leave heh.

Chardok.. that was for random_cleric01/randon_guild.  I was pulling a
friends guilds Kael arena raid, and they rescued some other wiped guild, and
merged the raids or something.

Anyway at the end of the night a cleric from the other guild asked me if I
could pull her Royals raid.

The guild didn't really have any competent pullers, and I knew if I left the
whole raid ended.. so I just stuck it out for the 2 kings and 2 princes.

I did warn them though.. once it hit 8am or so my time, if anybody didn't
follow orders/moved to the wrong place etc... I was liable to rip their
heads off
