I don't really see how you can say the 30 points you are given are
enough to screw up your character. Even in release, when you could
actually create a character without having assigned any of the points, a
wizard I knew did just that and still easily made level 50 and ended up
with 200 int, and she was human to boot, not one of the better races for
a wizard. Now especially, there are items you can accumulate that can
balance out poorly chosen starting stats available for relatively cheap.
Even gnome warriors can reach 305 sta by the end game with equipment
available and buffs, so really, your original character stats are
relatively meaningless in the long run.

You could just as easily argue that some race/class combinations
shouldn't have been allowed because they made such poor examples of the
class. Erudite paladin for one, with poor melee stats, poor wisdom and
the totally unnecessary high int. Yet, back in release on my server one
of the first players to 50 was an erudite paladin, who was also very
effective at playing his class, dispite the gimpiness of the erudite and
general weakness of paladins.
