It's a bug since the last patch.  They will probably correct it at
next patch.

To answer the original question, it does matter, if it's an instrument
based song.  Holding the correct instrument generally makes a song at
least 1.8 times more effective, and up to 2.5 times more effective
with certain instruments.  However, it's often better just to use your
weapons and take the partial effects of the song.  The only place I
generally use weapons often as a bard is on dragon runs, with my drum
I can boost PR/DR or FR/CR 91 points, and MR 182 points, compared to
34 and 68 points.  The miniscule melee damage I can do is seriously
outweighed by the added resist when the dragon is dropping an AE every
few seconds.  However, if I'm in a normal exp group the difference
between a 8pt damage shield and a 19pt damage shield probably isn't
worth the loss of melee capability.
