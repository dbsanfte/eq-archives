Sadly the Beast cannot haste a sub 40ish level toon, neither can he regen
it, what he can do is, give Hp, str, ac, dex, atk buffs, slow and weaken the
mob, then turn his back, the occasional slow/debuff, will maintain aggro if
you like, or you can just heal the PLee once they get aggro.Oh and kneeling?
not sure how thats done, but if you sit, first time you are hit you stand
up, Just turn your back on them., that's how I play it.
