Well last night every gnoll and centaur I saw was marked as an
individual encounter. All the Griffons, scarecrows, lions and undead I
saw were also now an individual encounter. That's not to say there were
alone, since you had groups of 3 gnolls what were marked as a
individual encounter.

Not sure about the giants and gnolls beyond them. Although I tend to
find out tonight. Anywhere indoors is untouched.
