    Not quite. The formula Robert gave was for your TOTAL MANA POOL, before
adding in plus MANA items. To calculate the difference between two items,
use WIS*(LEVEL/5).

    Example: Bill would like to know whether to wear Polished Bone Hoops or
Gold Jasper Earrings at level 20. His current WIS without either item is
100. Without GJEs, his total mana pool is 100*4 + 40 = 440. With them, his
total mana pool is 106*4 + 40 = 464. The difference is 464-440=24 mana,
which is more than if he had on two Polished Bone Hoops (10 mana each).
Notice that the difference, 24 mana, equals (the items' WIS)*(level/5),
which is the formula you were using earlier.
