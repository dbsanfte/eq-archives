Well, I can think of a couple problems with your plan.

One, the fight is going to last longer due to your lowered damage
output.

Two, the procs aren't a heal, they are a rune, and a small one.  At
level 65 what mobs are you killing where 200 points is going to make
any real difference?  mobs in POD hit for more than that per blow...
and quadding.  Say your target mob hits for only 200, thats still 800
points per quad of which you are eliminating only a quarter.

But worse, that quarter assumes the proc happens for each and every
quad... but you posit an average of 5 procs per fight.  Thats 1000 hp
absorbed per fight at best; if you are fighting mobs that only do 1000
hp per fight you might as well just rely on your greater healing
spells to take care of cleanup after the fight.

Use a real weapon, finish the fight twice as fast, that means the
damage you take is halved... almost certainly a lot more damage saved
than 1000 points.

Sadly, this tends to be true of most proccing weapons; trading off the
damage from the occaisional proc for reduced straight weapon damage is
rarely a good plan, other than certain special effects, like slow or
snare for people who can't cast either and aren't grouped with someone
who can do it for them.

Splendid
