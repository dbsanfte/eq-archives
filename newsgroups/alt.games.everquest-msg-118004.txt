Timeshare and 'body part' ownership aren't scheduled for implementation
until 2nd quarter 2003 unfortunately. We're still trying to assertion
what price the market would support on Ogre 'appendages'

NOTE: My magelo profile can be used only by fully paid up subscribers.
Anyone attempting to use that link without payment is clearly committing
a federal offence punishable by seizure of all assets and 50-70 years
incarceration without parole.
