True, but as risk drops to zero, exp gained also drops to zero.  Remember, 
this is also in echo caverns, a zone with a -lower- than average ZEM (65, 
IIRC).  Yes, he only has to kill <20% of the mob.  But he must also 
successfully pull the mob, and run across inhospitable and trap-laden 
terrain without a wormspore stick spell screwing him up.

It's risking wasted time, having to go pull another one and/or wait for 
repops.  No, it is not fatal, but then fatality is just -more- wasted 
time.

Right.  Assuming that whole series of spells works as planned without 
resists on a -red- mob, you're golden. :) And, assuming while you were 
doing all that, you managed to AE stun the add, but -not- the guard, and 
weren't busy dealing with the add while the guard finishes off your 
intended pull and moves on to break the mezz you just cast on the add at 
an inconvenient moment when you were closer to the mob than the guard was, 
I think you'd be entirely justified in getting some measly exp as a reward 
for playing your enchanter well. :)

See 'wormspore stick spell' mentioned above.  Remember also the random 
wandering pops that suddenly appear on the path between you and the guard.  
Never mind the rocks and stuff a running gnome can easily get hung up on 
and lose his lead.  Never mind that you have to wait for the mob to make 
turns so it doesn't warp through a wall on top of you.  Sure, it's 
trivial. :)

It can still take a considerable length of hallway.  Enchanter nukes cast 
and refresh slow.  Red mobs resist a lot.  The odds of the mob finding 
help are not insignificant.  Trust me, I've exped there a lot with a 
variety of characters. :)

No, but the fact that it in no way involves a bug that I can see leans in 
the 'not an exploit' direction.  The fact that he is never in a 'safe 
spot' (a spot where mobs simply can't path, but he can damage mobs from)  
helps.

Sounds perfectly legit to me. *Shrug*.  Remember, enchanters are 
tiny-scrap-of-paper people.  We're -designed- to not be able to win a 
toe-to-toe fight.  We -have- to do something relatively clever and offbeat 
to succeed.  He may find it far more efficient to charm the mob where it 
spawns and sic it on its neighbor, though.

The method he's using really isn't all that different from bard charm 
kiting... Convincing other things to kill your pet is part of what 
charming's all about.  A big part.
