Heh, HQ bear pelt on one in EC once.

Friend went to camp AC in SRo:  one hour later, has boots
(not ring, boots);

same friend went to camp AC in Guk:  waits for person camping
it to leave (that person left after spending 11 hours camping it
without success), on next spawn (about 10 minutes) friend gets
item.

Guy has the best luck I've ever seen.   (Yes, they're both "I know
a guy" stories, but I was in /tell with him on both nights, and
watching /who, and know they're true.)
