Not quite.
Keep in mind, these skills are designed with Luclin mobs in mind.  For
example, Critical Complete Heal is something like 21000hps (at least
that's why I routinely see from our guild cleric's heal messsages),
which admittedly is totally useless since I doubt there's any warrior
that can hit more than 10000hps (well, at least not yet anyways).

However, there's a fairly nasty little curse that some mobs will proc
which makes any tank only be healed for half of the normal heal
amount.

That means for CH, it will only heal about 5100hps.  You might think,
so what?  Unfortunately, all our main line tanks have between 6200 to
6500hps.  Loss of 1100 to 1400hp on the complete heal is noticable.

That doesn't even consider what that little annoying as fuck curse
does to spells like Divine Light, Remedy, Nature's Touch, etc...

Maybe.
But sometimes our healing chains have to have a nice long gap between
heals or the aggro the cleric generates is just too much.
