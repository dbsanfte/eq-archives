And you are welcome to think that.  I think otherwise.  Just maybe, I
might have a reason for that.  Do I care if you care?  Nope.  There
might be a reason that I feel the way I do.  Could even be a reason
behind the statements I've made on the topic.  Heck, might even have
something to do with one particular Guide who put far more effort into
helping folks than any sane person should have only to be spit on as a
direct result of her words.  Maybe.  I don't need to convince anyone on
this issue, not trying to tell you or anyone else to change their mind,
but I'll be damned if I'll keep my mouth shut and not say my piece any
time someone posts a link to her bullshit.  Some folks might think she
was a hero, but I know what I know.
