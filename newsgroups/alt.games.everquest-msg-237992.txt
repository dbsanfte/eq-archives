Agreed.  Bizbee seems up for some sarcasm counseling.

True.  The nature of the hurt was caused by her flippancy, her avoidance of
me and then her pretending she wasn't trying to avoid me - that everything
was normal with us.  When I sought discussion to have her admit her
intentions, she was evasive.  The flippancy raised my ire, the ire turned to
hurt.

We filled the holes, as you put it, and then realized it was time to move
on.  My problem was trying to remain friendly still.  I told her multiple
times I was removing her character names from friends and her email from my
address book, and I would never get a response.  Not a "boo hoo", not a
"maybe that's for the best", nada.  She was comfortable with allowing me to
simmer in my own assumptions and then accuse me of "assuming too much".  She
lacked communication skills I guess, which would explain some of the marital
problems she told me about.

And you are right, of course.  I didn't mean anything to her in reality,
though she pretended I did, and she was good at it.  I exaggerated things a
bit myself to her, but I was direct.  I would tell her to go get help if she
was unsatisfied with her marriage.  Go get help, or make up her mind and
leave.  I just tired of hearing about it and sympathizing for her.  However,
I told her I was still interested in GAMING and GROUPING with her.  When she
realized I wasn't going to play the sympathy game anymore, that was the end
of me.  I guess that burst the fantasy bubble.
