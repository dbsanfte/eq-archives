From someone who has clocked enough years in both countries to actually
know what I'm talking about, the truth is that you would be wrong. In
fact, Britons paint in general a more accurate picture of themselves in
their movies than Americans do. 

In my experience, the typical American from either Coast is very much
like the typical European. Some Americans from the deeper parts of the
country are quite unlike what you can find anywhere else, true, but then
again, they don't feature heavily in American media either.

The same as with race, the average difference between any two Americans
(or two Europeans) is much greater than the averaged difference between
Americans and Europeans.
