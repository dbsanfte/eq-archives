Based on my experience with melee characters (54 Paladin w/ 2 AA and
an assortment of other Paladins, Warriors and Rangers played to levels
between 17 and 38) I would say that, for straight melee damage, the
hate per hit = X + damage, where X is some constant noticeably larger
than 1.  I base this on the observation that when two melees are on a
mob and one is using a slow two-hander while the other is dual wielding
fast weapons it takes a pretty substantial advantage in damage output
for the melee with the two-hander to take or hold agro, but if that
disparity is there "big and slow" can indeed take and hold agro.  Hi
agro spells (and procs) like stuns, snares, and DoTs are a big deal
tho, as you say.  For example, my Paladin has held agro vs. a Monk who
was not only dual wielding fast weapons but outdamaging me while he was
at it, by chain casting stuns until I had agro solidly and then tossing
in an occasional stun to make sure I stayed at the top of the hate list.
On other occasions I have helped out people in trouble by chain stunning
a mob while they killed it, after half-a-dozen or so stuns it usually
takes a number of hits by the other person before the the mob turns.
