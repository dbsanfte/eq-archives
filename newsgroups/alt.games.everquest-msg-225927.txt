Do they get that much harder in the 50's and 60's? I've only had like 3 
failures total. One was on a hard assassination, and we had that one 
beaten, except for the target, which was a total badass and we ran out of 
time during our second stab at him, and the rest were pretty much due to 
incompetence or inexperience from some of the group members. The rest we 
finished with no deaths and time to all but clear the dungeons.
