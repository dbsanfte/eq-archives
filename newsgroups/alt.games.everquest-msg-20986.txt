Eh, sorry, I should have been more precise.  I know of no AC-ONLY buffs that
stack.  A druid's Skin buff is primarily a HP buff, and does not stack with
the free cleric HP buff.  The *coat series is primarily an ATK buff/damage
shield.  I'll take Empty's word that it gives AC...I never noticed it.

Enchanters get Augmentation at level 29.  This spell gives lots of stuff,
including AC though at level 29 above ground it's mostly used as a long
lasting haste buff, and under water it's great for keeping your STA bar nice
& yellow.

Enchanters get an AC-only buff (I assume shaman do too, since they're the
masters of buffs) that do not stack with the cleric's AC-only buff.
