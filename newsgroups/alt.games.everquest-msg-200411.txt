Just as you zone into Erudin from tox forest is a portal that teleports you
to a second balcony.
With the correct positioning you can run off the top balcony onto the floor
onto the platform and be in a Numlock safefall loop.

Please note it is my understanding that you should not do this unattended.
It is not the device method or whatever that creates banning. It is the
unattended getting gain part.

Soooo do paperwork read a book. Make poison. Essences. Chat. What ever. Just
don't hit a direction key ).
