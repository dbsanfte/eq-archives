It's easy not to die:  play outdoors (or in unpopulated dungeons at the
zone line), don't sit at zone lines or other places where you're likely to
get trained, don't pull where there's a possibility of getting an add, and,
most important, run at the first sign the fight's not going well.

Almost all deaths are caused by either getting an add (or trained, same
difference) or by thinking "well, that was unlucky, but I can still squeak
this one out."   The others are caused by simply choosing to be in a
place where you can't run when you KNOW you need to.
