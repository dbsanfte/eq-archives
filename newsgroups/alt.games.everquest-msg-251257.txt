Per PCGamer mag. EQ2 release date is set for Aug. 30th.  Given another post
that the release date has been moved up from Sept. 14th to Sept. 7th it
seems it will be sometime between Aug. 30th and Sept. 7th.  Now anyone who
currently plays EQ and buys EQ2 in the first month of its release isn't the
brittest bulb in the box!  Hell there are still bugs in the last two
expansions of EQ so we all know SOE dosn't give a crap about quaility or
playability...  just making money even if its unearned!  We should do
ourselves a favor and boycott EQ2 until all the (dozens) of bugs are fixed
in EQ!  Thats if one is dim enough to be sucked into buying EQ2 in the first
place.
