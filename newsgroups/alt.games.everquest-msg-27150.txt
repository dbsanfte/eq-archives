I have an Iksar shaman that I got up to level 20, my highest level
character, but I got frustrated playing her, so I put her on hiatus
for now.  Well, I decided to start up another Iksar shaman, now that I
know what I'm doing this time (thanks to the advice I've gotten here
and from various web sites).  I twinked her with some gear from my
first shaman and now I'm up to level 12 (dinged late last night).

Anyway, last night I'm soloing in the pit in Field of Bone when I get
a /tell from a level 12 monk asking if I want to group.  I say sure,
and he says to meet outside Kurns tower.  We set up outside Kurns
Tower to fight.  I SOW him, then he goes and pulls a bonebinder.  I
cast Drowsy on the bonebinder, then I sit and med and throw heals on
the monk when he loses two bubbles of health, then med, then heal,
etc.  After the spider is dead, the monk starts yelling, "HELP ME
OUT!!"  I'm like really puzzled, so I don't answer him at first.

Then he goes and pulls another bonebinder, and I do the same
routine--cast Drowsy on the mob, then sit and med, then heal the monk
when his HP starts dropping, med again, etc.  After the mob is dead,
then this monk starts yelling again, "HELP ME OUT ALREADY!!"  Well I
got pissed off and immediately hit /disband, then went back to where I
was soloing before. 

I was really irritated still, so after I got back to my old fighting
spot, I decided to send him a /tell so I /told him, "When l'm in a
group, I help by healing and then medding in between so I have enough
mana to heal.  That's what I do in all my groups.  If that isn't
helpful enough for you, then I won't group with you again.  Welcome to
/IGNORE", then I put him on /ignore.

I don't know if that was the right way to handle that situation or not
but I was pretty pissed off.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but when I'm
the only healer in a group/pair, isn't that what I'm SUPPOSED to be
doing?  (medding rather than meleeing).  I can't count how many times
I've read on this newsgroup about people complaining about being in a
group where the cleric/druid/shaman was meleeing instead of medding.
And yet here I am in a group where somebody is bitching at me because
I'm NOT meleeing!

On the other hand, I've found another monk who is level 14 that I've
made it a point to group with whenever he's on (sometimes joined with
another monk friend of ours)   We've been grouping together almost
every night for at least a week now, fighting either in the pit or in
Kurns Tower, and we've been having a ball.  And this is the exact
routine we follow when we're fighting--I cast Drowsy, med, heal, med,
buff, etc.  The only time I've ever been meleeing is either when
something has aggroed on me or else when the monk(s) are really
getting hammered on.  And this monk knows what he's doing, too; I'll
report my mana level after every fight and he'll wait till I'm 80% or
more before pulling; we take turns looting and we generally have a
great time.  

But anyway, just wanted to get that rant off my chest!

/RANT OFF.
