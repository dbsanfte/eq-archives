> Does this do more dps if I give it 2 weapons?

    Only if the two weapons are an upgrade to its natural attack, which
would be some serious weaponry. It will double attack and dual wield without
any weapons or with one, OR with two.

    There ARE some advantages to giving skelly pets weapons that don't
upgrade their smackdown power tho:

    1) Even with just one weapon, skelley's stop acting like an idiot and
use normal human animations for running, walking and fighting.

    2) I *think* that when you give him bashing weapons, he does crush
damage which is more likely to stun. If I'm wrong I'll be corrected shortly
:)
