Go read VI's posts on the developer's boards on this subject from
yesterday. Before all you casters start soiling your loincloths, it
looks like their idea of "un-nerfing the casters" is primarily the
addition of more of the "ancient spells" so that casters can see some
major advance in power from end game content on par with the advances
melee players see from the uber-loot equipment they can get.  Of course,
we're talking about a tiny portion of the population here, since these
spells will drop off of mobs *starting* with Trakanon, and then moving
up from there (ToVN, et. al.) so I wouldn't be looking for any
ultra-souped-up mages in the near future at the low to mid levels. (Say,
below 55).
