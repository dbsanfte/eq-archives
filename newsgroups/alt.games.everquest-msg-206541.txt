Sure you can agro them, you are then ported out immediately.  I've done 
it.  Actually, I had my pet fighting Naggy for a while until I attempted 
to cast a spell on Naggy myself.  Naggy was behind a closed door, and my 
pet was smacking through the door.  I tried to debuff, at which point I 
was ported out.  Possible exploit potential here?
