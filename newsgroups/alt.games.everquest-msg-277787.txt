Right now, the brand new EQ player is all but forced to buy plat just to be 
on a level playing field with 95% of the other players. There have been 
many factors that have contributed to this over the years, but what SoE is 
doing with EQ2 is accellerating this downward spiral by facilitating that 
which erodes the game.

It won't be just on a few servers. Sure, they will only facilitate it on a 
few, but their 180-degree spin on their previous stance that denounced this  
sort of activity as harmful to the game will only increase the pollution of  
the non-Exchange servers by the IGE's of the world.

People are misunderstanding SoE's vows to continue to seek out and 
eliminate botters and farmers. They only care about those who *monopolize 
content*. They don't do a thing about those who market their in-game items 
otherwise.
 
This is a very bad direction for them to take, philosophically speaking.
