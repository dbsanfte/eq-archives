Hi EQers.

I read somewhere that the new hate is like a tier 1, and deeper in its like
a tier 2 PoP zone.
What about the minis then, can they be handle with a single grp of 65 with a
decent amount of DPS or would we need a few more for it?
Are some of the minis harder than others?, me and my friends could get a few
upgrades from the new loottable, and if they are like BoT minis or something
then it could be a fun place to go for some xp.
I know the minis are spawned like the 64 minis in BoT, by killing PHs every
30 mins, how rare is the named spawns?

Thx in advance
