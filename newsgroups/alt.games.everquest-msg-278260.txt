I remember posts quite some time ago, mostly from warriors, stating
that warrios were useless because Paladins and SK's had all their
strengths plus spells.  Go back further and it was monks but I'm only
concerned with plate class tanks here.

After that I recall posts about the improvements in warriors and how
they had increased taunt and mitigation over SK's and Paladins.  It
got to the point where the SK's and Paladins were complaining that
they had been marginalized.
To that end, somewhat, I also recall groups only wanting warriors, not
hybrid tanks so there may be some truth to that.

There seems to always be a swing in the favored class dujour, but my
question is this:  are warriors currently preferred in groups over
Paladin's and SK's?
Obviously this is a general question, but in general is there an
advantage to pure tank v. hybrid tank in *most* situations?
I understand GoD raids (maybe all raids?) prefer warriors as tanks.  I
assume this is because of the mitigation and generally higher HP's.

But for the non or infrequently raiding hybrid tank, are we still
desired?

Thanks.
