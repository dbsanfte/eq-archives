Must you always resort to insults?  Your points are taken much more
seriously when you avoid them.

Y'klnow, I like to solo from time to time.  There was a time that soloing
was all I did.  That's the sole reason I made my druid and my necro.  SOE
continues to make changes that take me away from that activity with every
patch.

No sense whining about it.  Deal with it and move on.

You see, all the whining about soloing nerfs or KEI adjustment isn't going
to do a thing.  VI had the right catchphrase from the start ... you really
are in their world now.

If you don't like it, leave.  It's really that simple.

Watch that door ... it snaps back quickly.  Might hit you on the ass on your
way out.
