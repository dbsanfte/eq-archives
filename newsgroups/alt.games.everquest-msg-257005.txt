I've seen an interview in which he agrees he said that, but not the 
original comment. I also know that most people take it out of context. 
As much as I dislike M$'s founder, he was referring to the market for 
small, relatively affordable desktop computers. There were already 
computers using more that 640k at the time ( I worked on one, though it 
was considered near obselecant at the time I was using it. Learned 
programing COBOL on an 4 (or 8.. I keep wanting to say 8) MB machine 
that originally cost six figures. It could support 12 interactive 
terminals at 19200 bps, and had been donated to my high school by a 
bank. This was about the same time the 286 came out, though Intel 
expected to only sell them to the high end server market at that time. 
Our 'personal' computers were TARS-80 model 3's and 4's, 2 T's, and an 
Apple //c I could make do all sorts of neat tricks. On a side note, I 
NEVER WANT TO SEE COBOL AGAIN, thank you.)
Back on topic, do you think they will ever hit level 100? or do you 
think the game will fade before it gets to that?
