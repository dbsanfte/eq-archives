Move on to another camp.  Technically they're right.

But definitely find out who the guild leader is and let them know that one
of their officers stole the camp.  The leader may not care...but then again
he/she just might!

I'm a guild leader...I WANT people to tattle on my members.  I DEFINITELY
want them to tattle on my OFFICERS.  It may be just a game but I do take my
reputation seriously.
