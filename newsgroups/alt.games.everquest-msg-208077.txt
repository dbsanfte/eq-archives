ME being the worst place to run too for safety, you hit a train the other
side and you are not gonna be around long.
ME's trains to the DSP zone seem to stick around for ages, too.

I often hunt zone lines of quiet dungeons that are just in my level
range...Trains here are rare, unless I cause them, due to the lack of other
players and if one does get run into me I know the score well enough to move
it asap. What amazes me is that people will come into these places, see me
hunting there, then sit and go AFK!?! They must think I'm an awesome puller
not to ever make an error and overpull...Going AFK at any zoneline is
stupid, going AFK at the zone of a Dungeon where someone is using it as an
area to pull to, whether you think this it is right or not, is pretty much
suicidal.

Last train I got hit with I was not on the zone line, or near it...I was in
an empty, dead end room where I was pulling gnolls too in Splitpaw...I can
only assume the owner of the train either got lost or expected me to
help...When questioned with a "did you get lost?" I was offered the
opportunity to perform fellatio on the player...which was nice.
