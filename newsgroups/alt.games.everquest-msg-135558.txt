Congratulations, you get the point here.  Fair enough, I led you to
where I wanted several times too.   I do hope you won't take the
predictable next step and explain the inconsistency of some of your
posts away by claiming that you toyed with me all along.  Please go
for something more original.

> I don't know how it is in your group,

You're not talking to "my group", you're talking to me.  Once that
concept dawns on you you may see a lot of things differently.

Enjoy the warm fuzzy, its probably the only one you'll get from me.

So what?   Makes no difference to me if they attack you personally or
you throught the proxy of your family.  If they actually communicated
directly with your family, its another matter, but this is only an
extension of calling you a "son of a bitch".  It is no more right or
wrong than any other personal attack.  While I don't want to condone
personal attacks on Usenet, your example of the rape victime falls a
bit short.  A woman is not responsible for being raped because of a
mini-skirt, but if she goes out and pays a thug to rape her, its
another matter.  You are getting the attacks you want to get against
you and your family (if they exist) by playing games to create this
behaviour.

Your example also fails in another way.  Little or no true harm can
result to a healthy adult from a personal attack on Usenet.  A great
deal of harm results from rape.

To match your victim mentality.

I wasn't just talking about this point.

Its sad if you believe half the shit you posted in this thread.  Like
I said, I'd be happy to ignore you, but ignorant idiots like you make
it harder for me to enjoy my life.  Fortunately anti-discrimination
laws exist andare becoming more effective, and in another decade or so
you may no longer be able to harm others with your misguided views.
