I was playing my old-school, twinkless wood elf warrior today. I was doing 
my early teen levels in West Commons so that I could pick up a bunch of 
tradeskill components while they still gave me xp. I got to level 14 and, 
now that I had dual wield, decided to first get my current level's 5 points 
in 1hs, then move my fastest 1hs to my off-hand and work my 1hb in my 
primary, using my faster 1hs in the secondary to work dual wield. Well, I 
had my 1hs maxxed by about 25 or 30% (DEX is only 90, so I make do with 
what I have) and made the switch.

By about 75%, I had only seen a single 1hb skill-up, and that had been 
shortly after making the switch to 1hb primary. I had maxxed it as well the 
previous level, so I couldn't figure out what was wrong. It was then that 
it occurred to me that I hadn't seen any dual wield skill-ups either. I was 
thinking that I was bugged or something and was going to log off and come 
back, when, on a whim in the middle of a fight, I just grabbed the 1hb out 
of my primary hand and turned around and put it right back in between 
swings. Bingo. I saw a 1hb skill-up within like 2 seconds. Well, you can 
imagine what the next 10% of my level was spent doing. Yup, grabbing the 
weapon out and dropping it back in between swings and various other weird 
stuff, trying to figure out what was going on.

90% rolled around and I still hadn't seen another skill-up (and still none 
in DW, btw). I didn't have a second 1hb weapon to drop into the secondary 
slot, so I just pulled the 1hs out of the secondary, leaving just the 1hb 
in the primary. Bada bing, an almost immediate 1hb skill-up. Then, what 
really had me scratching my melon - a *dual-wield* skill-up. My secondary 
weapon was still on my cursor. Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you need 
to actually *be* dual-wielding to get a dual wielding skill-up? I left the 
secondary slot open until I finished the level (15, yay me) and logged for 
a while. Oddly enough, I was able to max my 1hb before I levelled.

Has anyone else seen strange behavior like this before?
