I now can make some electrum jewelry (skill of like 87).

My question is: Of the stuff I make, what do you all consider to be the most
sought after rings/necklaces/bracers/veils at levels like 1-20?

From my experience +2 wis, +2 str, +2 int sell pretty well. lately I have
been selling the electrum/cat's eye bracers (+4 CHR) and the +3 silver cats
eye necklace (+3) as a (+11) Charisma kit. Never found STA +2 earrings sell
real well, though not bad. Rarely ever asked for dex bracers +2, nor agi +2
rings....
