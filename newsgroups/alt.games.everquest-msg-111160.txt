I wouldn't exactly call it persecution, but notice that there are many
messages in these newsgroups attacking christianity and none attacking
wicca.  Some are attacking what some particular christians have done (with
the implication that they do it because they are christian).  Others (a few)
have called for banning religion altogether.  As for Ashcroft, that is a
whole nother kettle of fish.
