Upon first reading the subject line and your opening paragraph, I found
myself thinking "How in the hell did he get into PoF at that level?"
:-)

(Sorry, I just realized upon re-reading that this joke will make no
sense to you. The Plane of Fear has some mini-boss mobs named Fright,
Dread, and Terror. But you won't have to worry about them for a long
time yet.)

Anyway, relax. Enjoy. As others suggested, print out some maps of all
the zones you think you may be going through. Eventually, if you are
like most of us, you'll have binders by your computer with maps of every
zone in the game. You can find them at www.eqatlas.com

Go explore and have a good time. If you die, make sure you already have
a hotkey setup doing a /loc.  If you are being attacked, and think you
will die, hit that a few times right before you go down and you'll be
able to scroll back and jot down the location of where your body is. If
you don't know how to make a hotkey yet, respond back here and ask, and
we'll tell you.

East Commons and West Commons can be great at your level. In the other
direction, the Karanas can be a wonderful place to explore as a new
player with lots of good hunting for you druid types. Visit Qeynos! Vist
Freeport! Take the boats over to the lands of the Dwarves and the
Erudites!

It's a beautiful world they built, and I still remember the fear and
excitement I felt when I first struck out from my homelands to explore
it.  Take a journey and enjoy yourself. 

When in a zone where you want to hunt, put your LFG tag on just in case
anyone is checking (not that they often do) and don't be afraid to
occasionally use the OOC channel to say
/ooc Level 11 Druid LFG

You might get invited and meet some new people and have fun. If not,
you're a druid. You can always solo.

Enjoy, and if you have more questions, come back and ask.
