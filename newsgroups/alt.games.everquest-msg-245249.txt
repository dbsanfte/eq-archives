Yes the AI is old fashioned.  You would expect caster mobs to hang
back rather than charging into melee to get slaughtered.

However, if the AI was better it would be a slaughter .. can you
imagine the mob  casters seeing a wizard standing there and chain
nuking him?  Wouldn't be many people playing casters after a few weeks
of that !

What about the mobs that see your cleric and think "breakfast" before
he even starts healing?

They'd have to redesign the whole balance of the game (taunt / aggro
etc) to make that work.
