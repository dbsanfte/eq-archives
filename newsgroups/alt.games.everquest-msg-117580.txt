No, I'm not mistaken, you just have a different definition of "many."
Kunark has been out for over two years; and Fear and Hate (and I THINK Sky)
both precede Kunark.

Exactly how long should we reasonably wait before expecting an almost 3-yr
old zone's map?  Velious has been out for well over a year.  No map of ToV
yet??  I've not yet been there, but I got the impression it was as easy to
map as Howling Stone (which, btw, he doesn't have a map of) but it's not
there?

*shrug* I'm not complaining...then again, I tend to avoid his site, I go to
eqmaps most of the time (I only have the eqatlas maps that Map Tracker uses
by default).  I assume that some of the money I gave to allakhazam went to
him, but I'm not complaining.  It does surprise me any time someone defends
him for missing FAR too many ancient maps.
