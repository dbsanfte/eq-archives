Just look at /played, and how large the numbers there are.  Anything that
takes that much time is more than "just" a game.

Make that "some other games".  There are other games that I'd put with EQ,
and not just computer games.  For example, chess.  The key is that they can
be absorbing enough to be your primary means of entertainment, so you can
spend a lot of time on them, and that you can get better at them over time,
and that they have some aspects that aren't as entertaining as other aspects
of them, but that doing will increase your enjoyment later.

It is this last aspect that makes it sensible to say that you "invest" time
in these games, because your time playing is not only for immediate
entertainment, but also to set up for later, hopefully better, enjoyment.
Indeed, in EQ, a given play session is often NOT entertaining at all, but is
purely to set up for later entertainment.
