Well, considering that it was gimped up until about 3 weeks ago having a
target limit of *lower* level than the 34 charm, the only reason I had it
was because I'm a bit anal about having a full spellbook.  I keep getting
pissed off about not being able to get the sarnak night dust in FM for the
beguile plant (level 29) spell and of getting fucked over for Remove Curse
(39).  As well as the whole disappointing load of crap that is
Levitation/Everlasting Breath (the Luclin asshat spells) (51)

When I make 54 I'm going to be annoyed though, since I'll be missing the
aforementioned 4 spells, as well as Blizzard, SoE and Remove Greater Curse
(there's another asshat spell).  And it only gets worse after that.  I
really want Nature Walkers Behest, Tunare's Request would also be nice to
play with at times, but every spell that I try to buy, some jackass wants
3k+ for. (12k for Booboo)

NOTE TO VI:  DON'T MAKE A SPELL THAT 3+ CLASSES CAN USE THAT ONLY DROPS IN
ONE PLACE OFF ONE THING (the asshat spells, levitation (shm/dru/wiz/enc)
from a named vamp in Tenebrous, Everlasting Breath(shm/dru/enc) from a
beetle in the Deep, and Greater Remove Curse(shm/dru/clr/pal) from Rhag 1
and Arch Lich)
