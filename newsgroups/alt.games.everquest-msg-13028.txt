So I will get it a little sooner if I kill the right mobs then? :)

It also has the disadvantage of being a nice self root, but hey, I've
used level 9 treeform for the regen boost in my 30s :)

I think I probably formulated it badly. I don't think enchanters
should get nukes any more than I think wizards should have healing
spells or druids be able to mez animals (spur of the moment example)
It's just that mana draining for wizards seems wrong to me. I can see
wizards dealing with all the elements to cause damage, adhering a mob
to the ground and spinning mana out of thin air, but not doing that.
It'd be tampering with the mind instead of the 'raw power' stuff I
usually think of when dealing with wizard. If you have a better way of
defining a wizard's working area in as few words as possible, feel
free to share :) (I'd feel the same if someone were to suggest druids
get a shaman poison dot - poison is not what a druid works with)

Mana nuke? Magic based, no DD but removes mana without giving any back
to the wizard? I could see something like that be more in keeping with
a wizard's abilities without copying the enchanter spell. (In order to
not start another 'wizards live and die by their mana bar' debate,
let's just consider this less likely than a Harvest upgrade? :) )
