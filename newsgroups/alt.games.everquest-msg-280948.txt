Why not ask on the EMarr forums instead of here?

There is a mix of people on EMarr, I usually don't have trouble finding a 
group, and generally don't have too much trouble with immature idiots of 
any age.  Not to say there aren't any.

As for guilds, it all depends on what level of content you want to be 
raiding at, and how often you are looking to raid.  I don't have URLs for 
them, but a quick google search should get you to them.  Here is a list 
off the top of my head of current raiding guilds:

Affliction
Whit's End
Triune
Resilience
Midnight Fury
Magister (are they still active?)
Sanctuary of Marr

SoM, which I am in, is currently working on getting to Time, we have 
recently downed Xegony and Fenin Ro, and are working on getting enough 
flagged to hit Coirnav, then Rathe Council.

The other guilds I mentioned are in Time or well beyond it.  I am sure I 
missed a few current raiding guilds as well.
