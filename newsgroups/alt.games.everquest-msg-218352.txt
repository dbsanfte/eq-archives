Because english is read from left to right, top to bottom.  Top posting
flows against that, and makes it difficult to follow a conversation if
you're not there from the start.

If I come into a conversation after it's begun (due to my newsserver not
getting the OP, my being away from the house for a few days, whatever), I
can read a message with bottom posted replies and it flows like a book.  Top
posted replies don't allow the conversation to read like a conversation.
