56. A good selection of ATK buffs. Fast wolf form. Trueshot. Self
regen spells. 

Rangers dont really have many power "spikes" though, they just steadily
progress getting stronger. They're the druid of the melee classes,
good at everything, the best at certain things in certain situations,
but never really the "definitive" answer. 

I suppose you could argue for Archery Mastery 3 & Endless Quivver
but thats very very very very very very very end game ;)

Sui (5 more AAXP to archery mastery 1.... sigh....)
