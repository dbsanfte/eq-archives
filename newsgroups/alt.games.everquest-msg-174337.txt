Yes, I do admit that. 

I don't believe its all about oil either.

I would like to know what is going to happen if,
and when, Saddam is toppled. 

What steps will be taken to ensure the devil you
don't know will be better than the devil you do
know?

I know we have had some disagreements in the past,
and will probably have more in the future, but if
you are going anywhere near that area in the near
future, I wish you and your comrades the best of
luck.
