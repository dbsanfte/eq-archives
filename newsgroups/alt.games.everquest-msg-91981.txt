For tradeskills... only the number of attempts matters. You can advance just
as fast making something that trivials above 200 as you can by taking baby
steps... but you are guaranteed to fail a lot and waste money.

It's never too late for combat skills (casting included). The problem with
raising skills in combat is that the other guy already has his skills maxxed
for his level... and will damage you faster. Your 'skill failures' (you keep
missing him) are still being checked for advances... it's just that you're
dying in the process :o(

Find the fastest weapon you can for that particular skill (damage doesn't
matter... a DAM 40 weapon that keeps missing is doing the same as a DAM 8
weapon that keeps missing... nada!), get yourself some haste, regen, and a
minder (healer, mezzer or fearer) find a critter that's a 'blue' as you can
get and start playing wack-a-mole.
