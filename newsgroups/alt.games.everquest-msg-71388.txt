If you do a /movelog to another server, you character exists on
both servers, right?   If it's not, then they delete chars every
time a /movelog is done.

Anyway, they *delete* the toons from one and add them to another.
It's trivial to just not add them to a new one.   Talk of "how hard it is
for VI to delete characters" just isn't realistic, IMO.  They do it
whenever they have a need to do so.   The character and item files
are clearly some sort of database implementation and deleting
records should be trivial to implement.

From my experience, I'd guess that they're running a database
backend that simply isn't taxed for storage.   The reason they
don't do periodic deletes is because they don't need to for any
technical reason.   People who may let their account lapse and
come back in a few months who wouldn't continue to play if they
had to start over again just gives them a reason not to be "tidy"
in their database management.

Marketing droids who want people to be able to come back and
"lazy" database administrators who don't have a technical reason
to clean up databases generally win over the type of technician
who wants 'optimization' and 'clean' databases every time.
