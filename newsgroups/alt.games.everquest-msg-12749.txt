	The Dragons will agro on you if you drag an animal too close to them,
whether you are Ally with CoV or not.

	And yes, Snare is great, but this is Velious and everything has insane
resists.  Things out in WW hit for 2-300 a pop, so it only takes one unlucky
streak to wipe you out.

	I have no trouble getting resurrections either, especially since many
members of my guild will go out of their way to provide them.  The problem is
that there's no one out there in WW on most servers, and on the occasions
where someone is out there he is probably on a raid and not interested in
breaking off to res you.
