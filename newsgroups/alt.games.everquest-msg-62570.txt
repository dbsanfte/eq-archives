HP regen early on means you don't need a pet and that you won't need *any*
down time.
Later in life you'll be able to hunt with a pet from around level 20 on,
*very* effectively with very little or more often than not, no down time.

Over all the HP-regen means you'll have less down time and that makes the
exp penalty a moot point.
