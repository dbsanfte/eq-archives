I charm kited giants in iceclad, great exp and decent loot, and if you round
up 4 or 5 of them you can keep yourself occupied for about 7 or 8 minutes at
a time and get almost a yellow with each swarm, but it does take a lot of
practice. I rode those giants from 32 to 38 in 4 3 hour sessions.  then you
move on to bigger game for chant kiting.  And of course track at 35 makes
you tons more efficient.
