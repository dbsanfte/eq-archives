About fifteen years ago, I went to the Walter Reed Army Medical Museum in
DC. At that time, they had an exhibit up on birth defects, with several
preserved specimens on display. 

I can usually make it through anything with my *sang froid* intact, but
that exhibit gave me nightmares. Some of the birth defects displayed were
the most horrific things I'd seen. </aside>
