In that case you were correct. But DD spells don't taunt much. Debuffs 
(darkness line, ac, atk, str drains) and DoTs (darkness line, blood 
line, poisons, diseases) taunt a lot. It's even unfair how much they 
taunt. The simple level 9 disease DoT that does alltogether 30 or so 
damage and casts almost instantly adds so much to the hate value that 
it's not even funny. And it taunts even when resisted as well
