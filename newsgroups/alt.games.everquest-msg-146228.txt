Well, I dunno, but... VI's favorite response: get the latest drivers, get
the latest DirectX... upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. Didn't help me much so I
un-installed WinXP, re-installed Win98SE (despite the fact that I lost alot
better memory management) and all my problems went away like the in-laws
AFTER the holidays.
