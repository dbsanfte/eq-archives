Not that dumb...this is an issue with MMORPGs that will become important to
people, I think.  One thing about great games, and EQ was a great game, is
that people years later will remember it, and want to go back for old time's
sake and have one more evening of playing.

20 years from now, when I get nostalgic about Doom 1 and want to play, it
will just be a matter of digging up the files from my ancient backups,
downloading an appropriate emulator to emulate a 386 and Windows (and in 20
years, that emulator will be running faster than the real thing did, so this
will be no problem), and off I go.  With EQ and other MMORPGs, that won't
work.

I wish MMORPG companies would do like Id does, and release their old games
in source form under a free license.
