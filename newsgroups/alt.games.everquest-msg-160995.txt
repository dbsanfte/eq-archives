Health bars would be fantastic, and I'd happily sacrifice any amount of screen
space for them if required.

However, if they made it name, health, class, level, raid status (you know, raid
leader/group leader) then I could shrink the window down as I do now to include
only name health class.

Further, if they color coded the names instead of just the class name, I could
drop the class part too.

I have tanks set up as red, and I don't really really need to know that A is an
SK and B is a paladin and C is a warrior.  They all need looking after and they
all get Cheal or SR, never CE.

I have clerics set up as green, and they need looking after and get SR or
nothing, either its a bonafide emergency or they can handle it themselves.

I have Enchanters as purple, and they really need looking after, and get SR if
still getting hurt or CE if they just need patched back up.

I have bards and necromancers as yellow but frankly haven't figured out what to
do with them, necros pretty much ignore unless actively dying and designated
rezer, and bards... what heal for them?  Probably SR.

Sometimes I think I could reduce my heals memmed to SR and CHeal and just get
over the idea that there are cheaper heals in the game.  At any rate, everyone
else is coded white, and if they aren't in my group, they aren't getting a
heal.  Hmm, better pick a color for monks, but I only heal monks on request.
