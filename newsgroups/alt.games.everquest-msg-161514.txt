Not shot down, never considered.  I was not placing the blame for the lack
of judges on the Republicans solely, just mentioning that it was no
different when Clinton was in office, and the Republicans controlled the

tml  I'm sure I can find many more where either party is to blame for just
not even allowing a candidate to get to the point of being considered beyond
the comittee stage.  It's just a game of tit for tat.
