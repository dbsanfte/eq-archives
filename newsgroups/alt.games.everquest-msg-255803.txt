I was just perusing the Rangers Glade forums, and came across a typical 
"our class sucks compared to their class and here's why..." type thread.

In this particular thread, one poster made the following claim:
"....warriors have superior melee skill/abilites and DPS than rangers 
(remember too melee > bows, easier to get, need fewer aa's, etc etc, all 
the old melee vs bow arguemnets)..."

This struck me as odd, since I had never believe it to be the case. I 
always thought rangers were a DPS class and a darned good one, at that. 
Just to clarify, he wasn't just comparing bow damage to warrior damage, he 
was comparing ranger to warrior.

So, is there any truth to his claim?
