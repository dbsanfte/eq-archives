I'm talking about the text color in the chat box. Text color for skill
ups etc. remained the same dark shade of blue as it always has been, but
for cons, the dark blue shade has been lightened. It may sound like nit
picking to you, but my eyes are unable to distinguish close shades of
the same color, Now, light blue cons and dark blue cons appear exactly
the same. I can't adapt as it is a physical problem with my eyes. I'm
not color blind, but somewhere between normal and color blind..... This
comes very close to making portions of the game unplayable for me. For
one, I can no longer pull.
