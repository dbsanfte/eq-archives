Dragon eggs make 20 clumps of dough each. I think Jazz would shoot me if I
tried that.

Wurm eggs make 14, so do drake. I'm happy to pay a plat or two per egg just
for the convenience of fewer combines.

Note to young hunters, lavastorm basilisks drop eggs that yeild 15 clumps of
dough per egg. I'll pay a plat each for one of them too- I got a lot of 10
lb Halas meat pies to bake to keep raising my skill.
