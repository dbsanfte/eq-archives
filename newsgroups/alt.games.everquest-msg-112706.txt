Well, it is hard to be a jeweler unless you can enchant your metal, since
the jewelry is not worth much if not enchanted.  Other than that it is easy.
Start with silver the lowest metal and malachite the lowest jewel and put
one each in the jewel kit and combine.  Sell what you make back to NPC and
buy more. When malachite is trivial go to the next cheapest jewel and
continue.

Of course spent as many practice points as you can to raise your skill
cheaply.

If you can get your metal enchanted the resulting jewel is worth more on
resale to NPC.
