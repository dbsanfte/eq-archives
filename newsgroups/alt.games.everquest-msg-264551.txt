It is. But I do think the description is somewhat wrong. The last
enchanter animation can utilize this disc too. But if it activates it it
reads something like Kabaner begins to use Taeelil as a living shield.
Taeelil would be the name of my enchanter. But I believe it really uses
itself as shield for me. Otherwise I'd be really disappointed. ;)
