 Because I'm squishy and don't have as many HPs as a warrior. I guess it
all comes down to how one defines 'tank'. I define it as more than just
a damage dealer. Having fairly decent AC doesn't make me a tank. No
matter what my AC I'll never be a 'tank' in the true sense. 

 As for my level I am 60. With self-buffs (Stave of Shielding proc) and
epic I am 1080AC or so I think. I'd have to check. With the right buffs
I can get in the upper 1100 (1186 sounds familiar for some reason) area.
