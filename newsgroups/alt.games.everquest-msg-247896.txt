How often do you play?  Around what times?  that is a question for all CoH
players here actually ;p  I get on after work around 7 am until the servers
go down for maint. and again around 6pm until 10pm when I go to work.  On my
days off around 6pm to 10pm then I go out with friends usually and get home
and on CoH around 2am until 8am or so then bedtime for me, gawd this 3rd
shift job has me all messed up, i also until now never realized how much
time I spend playing computer games.
