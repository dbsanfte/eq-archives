I've worked at Wal-Mart and, while running register, I saw people who came
through the line shortly after my nine-hour shift began, then came through
the line again an hour later, then again two hours later, then AGAIN ninety
minutes after that, and so on, all day long.  Some customers spent more time
in that store than I did.  People tell me, "You have no life because you
play computer games" and I just shake my head and smile enigmatically.
IMHO, living in the local department store is about as low as you can go.
