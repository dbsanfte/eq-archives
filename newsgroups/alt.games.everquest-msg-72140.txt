Yeah well if you want to run benchmarks that's fine, but many people are
suprised
to find that their Athlon just doesn't seem as fast as P4 in many games.
And in my experience the intels chips are considerably more reliable on a
decent
motherboard that the AMD chips. I think many of the crashes that people put
down to windows are down to their cpu overheating.
