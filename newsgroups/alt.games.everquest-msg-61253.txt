While I agree that he might as well just get the trilogy, $20 (separate) x2
= $40 (trilogy), and if you buy them at a local store there's no shipping.

ROK has a lot of players.  SoV doesn't.  You're more likely to find groups
in ROK at 30 than you are in SoV.  They're both fun places to hunt.

With SoV came some very nice GUI enhancements.  I think I'd buy it again,
just for those.  It's been a while since it came out so I can't tell you
what those enhancements ARE, but they're nice fixes (yeah, paying for
fixes). :)
