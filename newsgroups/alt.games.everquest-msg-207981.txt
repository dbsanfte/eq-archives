Soloing, I stuck to DOTs, stuns, slows, and letting pet do the killing.  
Grouping, I was always behind in mana from having only breeze and 
keeping those pesky short duration high mana cost Hastes on the tanks; 
at 29 I suddenly got Clarity -and- a long duration haste, mana is now 
available when grouping where it never was before.  Are chanter nukes 
really worth casting in the long run?  The first one had about a 1 
damage to 1 mana ratio, its hard indeed to care about something that 
sucks that much...
