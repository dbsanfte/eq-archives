They have reduced the choice of player races to "female wookie" to cut 
development time. Also, they make players pay five years in advance, 
they allow only one character per account, death is permanent, and once 
you die you aren't allowed to create a new one. This is to reduce server 
load.

Seriously now, I'm following the development of SWG too, and I don't see 
what's so wrong with it. I'll definitely give it a shot when it's 
released. Whether it will pull me away from EQ depends on where I can go 
with Hanrahan on the high levels. I'm with a very small guild, and 
raiding or getting flagged for the high-tier planes is pretty much out 
of the question.
