Here is my proof, right from the Cray website itself:
http://www.cray.com/products/systems/x1/CrayX1ProductSheet_pdfonly.pdf

Page 2 of the .pdf lists the peak performance of the Cray X1
supercomputer.  Here is a sample:

Cabinets    CPUs    Peak Performance
----------  ------  ------------------
1            16      204.8 Gflops
1            64      819.0 Gflops
4           256        3.3 Tflops
8           512        6.6 Tflops

204.8 Gflops divided by  16 CPUs = 12.8 Gflops per CPU
819.0 Gflops divided by  64 CPUs = 12.8 Gflops per CPU
  3.3 Tflops divided by 256 CPUs = 12.8 Gflops per CPU
  6.6 Tflops divided by 512 CPUs = 12.8 Gflops per CPU

Now then, perhaps you can tell me what part of my comment, "...any
given Cray X1 supercomputer CPU runs in the gigaflops range..." is
incorrect, Einstein?

I said, "...any given Cray X1 supercomputer CPU runs in the gigaflops
range...", Einstein.  What part of that aren't you understanding?

Common (non-high end) x86-compatible CPUs from Intel and AMD run in
the 4+ Gflops range these days.  This information is readily available
by performing a Google search.

Since you're clearly too incompetent to do research yourself, would
you like me to supply evidence in the form of URL links for this claim
as well, Einstein?

Guess what, Einstein?  9 women can't get together and have a baby in 1
month.  The same applies to many classes of computer problems: If the
problem isn't easily parallizable, all those extra CPUs won't do you
any good.

Emulating PC hardware falls under the category of "not easily
parallizable".  That means you'll probably only be able to leverage 1
or 2 of those CPUs in a Cray X1 supercomputer, which gives you about
25.6 Gflops to work with.

Emulation will eat up that 25.6 Gflops real fast.  You'll probably end
up emulating the PC hardware at 1/10th that speed, or 2.56 Gflops,
well below the speed of a high-end x86-compatible machine in the first
place.

But, Einstein, I never said that.  Good try, though.

Yes...it's me who is the idiot...

Idiot.
