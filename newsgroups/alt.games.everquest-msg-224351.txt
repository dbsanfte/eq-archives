I know how you feel except the most recent one for me was a lvl 65 who
pulled the giant captain in EW trained me when for whatever reason he
couldnt handle it.. and of course I died.. coz he FD at my feet and I
was 00m.

He then gave me the "you f**king noob" speach.. let me see, I was
pulling the single giants not the captain and a few wanderers and
struggling but getting nice xp.. I hadnt and wouldnt have ever taken
the captain coz it has in comparison a quadzillion HP.. yet somehow,
it made ME the noob..

There are people who do just stand there, you know they do coz Ive
heard some brag about how they get easy xp. If he didnt even have an
excuse 00m, didnt think I could handle 2, etc.. just avoid him..
theres plenty of other people in EQ.
