I'm 2 skill points away from being maxed at 252 with geerlok. Here's
the question.

What do I do with it now? I've asked in-game before and gotten a few
suggestions on how to make money from the skill. There's the standard
'Charge 10% of the resale value of the item for every combine, whether
it's successful or not.' Another is to get an EP capable person and
make a deal with them where they provide enough of the items for 2 bows
and the first successful combine goes to the them. If there are 2 
successes on combining, one bow for each.

The second one sounds beneficial for both the EP-capable person (who,
generally, will not have had the time to GM in fletching) and myself,
of course, but not sure how good it will sound when presenting to
them.

Opinions?

Tracey
