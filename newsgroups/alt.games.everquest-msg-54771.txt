Here's a link to a developer's board that specifically addresses tech
questions. It even appears that VI employees actually read it and
respond on occassion. No assurance it will help, of course, but the odds
are better posting something there than bitching about it here. (Odds of
somebody from VI actually reading it, that is.)
  Not to say it's certainly not a valid and on topic item to talk about
here, but a resolution is likely to only come from VI.
