You might try going into the modem properties, and make sure that the modem
speed is set to 57600, and that the box that says "only connect at this
speed" isn't checked.  If this gets to be a consistant  problem you can try
lowering the speed to 38400.  It might be slower, but you'll probably get a
better connection. It shouldn't cause any problems after you're actually
connected, but you never know.  You could also try unchecking the boxes to
use Error Control and Flow Control.  Again they shouldn't cause issues with
a USR modem, but you never know.  Those settings usually effect the cheap
ones like PCtel and HSPmicromodems, but I have seen it help.
Also if you have Kazaa, Imesh etc on the PC, I've seen the adware they
install with it cause problems too, but usually only when on Internet
Explorer.
