Well I just finished hunting in East Karana, it was a hoot and moved
quite fast.  Kiting 8 - 12 gorge hounds a pop was fun, but scary if they
managed to stun me for a second :o

Anyhow, I am close to another zone (king xxoob or something) with
minataurs which are blue to me at 21, it seems neat but I cannot get
enough room in there to round up a dozen or so.  I guess that would be
ok as I have to work on my combat skills somewhat.  However, kiting a
dozen + mobs is the best for xp, where else could I go outdoors that has
that sort of availability and I *will not* piss off other players?  EK
was great for that as it was almost always empty.
