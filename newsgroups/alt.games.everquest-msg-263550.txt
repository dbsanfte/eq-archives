Hmm, if that's whining, then just what the hell is it that MY kids are 
doing?! I believe what Dick did for us was state a problem concisely, issue 
a belief to be the source of the problem, and then proceeded to declare his 
opinion on options available for a solution. Where I come from, this is 
exactly the format you state a complaint. He has a valid point, and he 
accomplished his task at least with one person, and that is to make more 
people aware of the true source of a problem, and not just a bunch of 
misleading theories on what could be wrong but who cares because SOE owns 
us... I say bravo Dick, 5 minutes well spent on the soap box.
