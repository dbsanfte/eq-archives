    I have a logitech optical mouse with scroll button  and it also works
fine..Don't know what the issue is but on occassion I will lose the mouse on
the screen for a sec and it will reappear in the lowerleft hand corner of
the screen where it will be frozen for a couple seconds.. Then it is fine
again. I only have this problem in EQ. This is a fairly recent problem I
have had.. within the last couple patches.
