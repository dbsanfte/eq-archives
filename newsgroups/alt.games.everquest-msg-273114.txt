Certain guilds announced their intention to have a presence on certain
servers.  That snowballed when other guilds decided they wanted to be
competing against those particular guilds.  And then there were people that
saw that there were going to be several "uber" guilds on a particular
server, so chose to start there as well in the hopes of getting into one of
them in the future.  Those *weren't* just EQ guilds either.  There were
groups that came from various other games as well.

There are far far more people that created characters on the first day and
have seen a queue once or twice, if ever, than get queues regularly.  Go
read the boards.  They have a neat feature, you can see what server someone
plays on in their posts.  All the complaints about queues come from the same
half dozen servers (and usually from people that were level 40 in the first
week and complaining that they never get to play).
