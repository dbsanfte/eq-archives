you're right. group a level 15 with a level 29, and the level 15 won't get
experience. that's why I included this statement "this only works if the two
of you are in range that he would get exp while grouped with you"  (I've
been told by many people that the formula is level * 1.5, so a level 15 can
group with someone up to level 22 and get exp )

as well as this one "this really works better at higher levels, when the
level range for getting experience is so much wider...so if he's only level
15 and you're level 50, this won't work." but it can still work at lower
levels, as long as you're still in range, as I stated above.
