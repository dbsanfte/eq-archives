Hi everyone!

Me and my friend on EQ are gonna get married. I have picked out the last
name.. the place I want it.. all we have to do now is find out how to do
it.. LOL

I have heard of people using a char as the preacher..and fireworks..

I just wanted some advice.. on where to get things.. how to set it up..
things like that..

TIA
PS oh yea we have the wedding dress and the gnome skin for his tux.. but if
you have other ideas.. those will be very welcome also
