Well, the only viable choice for enchanter is gnome... because GNOMES
RULE!

I used to wish I had chosen dark elf for the racial ability to hide
for breaking charm, but now I have my dazzeling (sic) slippers which
proc invis, so no more need for hide.  There's also a ring that drops
in lake of ill omen that casts invis to animals, which could tide you
over until you could get your velious shoes.

When I started, I put 10 in charisma and 20 in inteligence.  If I
could do it over again, I would put 5 in intelligence and 25 in
stamina.  Now, unbuffed, my INT is up to 207 without ANY items or
jewelry that the only stat offered is INT.  No CHA items either and
that's at 152 unbuffed, which is more than high enough.
