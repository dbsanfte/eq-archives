While everyone gets points, only people who have items they are 
interested in buying in that particular type of mission benefit by 
having their spending limit increased.

I have, for example, an item that requires my Takish spending limit to 
be 760 or so.  While I can accumulate points in Miragul, Deepest Guk, 
whatever, I could have 2000 points, if I don't do sufficient Takish 
adventures to get my spending cap up to 760, then those other points are 
worthless to me (for this purpose).  At the same time, I could do 
-strictly- Takish adventures and get sufficient points to buy my item, 
as raising my spending limit to 760 will also generate 760 points.

Different classes have their most highly desired items purchased in 
different adventure camps.

Its still MUCH closer to fair than any other part of EQ.

Splendid
