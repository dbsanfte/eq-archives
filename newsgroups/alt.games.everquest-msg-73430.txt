Rumor has it that they allow you to cast as if you are of a higher
level, thus producing fewer resists against yellow/red mobs and fewer
fizzles. Don't know how accurate that is though. My chanter *thinks* she
has noticed fewer resists using them; but I haven't actually done any
scientific experiments on it. So far, it's just a perception thing.
