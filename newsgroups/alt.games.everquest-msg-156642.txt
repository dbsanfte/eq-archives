Some tradeskill items sell back for more than the cost of components.

The one I'm aware of is that the double-cam darkwood bow will sell back at
something like 30pp more than cost IF you make the cams with tinkering
instead of purchasing them.

The reason I'm aware of this is that this caused Verant to kill the
tinkering vendor in Shadowhaven, which was a bit of an inconvenience for me.

Since they started killing him around the time that the anti-macro warning
message went up, I'm thinking this is the specific exploit they were looking
at.

On the tinkering forums, one person said that he had seen a gnome running
continuously back and forth between the fletching and tinkering vendors in
Shadowhaven.  When the tinkering vendor was killed, he got stuck running in
place in the corner for several hours.
