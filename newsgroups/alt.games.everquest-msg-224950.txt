Well - I think I'd ask why the necro wasn't using Lich first off, 2nd
I'd ask how the 'chanter was doing on mana - if they were doing ok
they should have been Pac/Pull/mez and lining them up for you to knock
down.  This would have allowed you more mez time, and allowed them to
slow the mobs.  On one of the best LDoN missions I've been on our 'chanter
was our puller.3rd - The warrior must have been in gear that was seriously
lacking.  My 55 BL tanked a 30% slowed Mephit in PoN yesterday (don't
ask why) on a single druid CH.
