Yes, that is a known bug.

The safest way to handle fighting spiders (or anything that turns and runs
when it's low on health) in the pit is to pull it to a ramp or completely
out of the pit.   When it finally turns to escape, it will not attempt to
walk through the side of the ramp wall, and will usually walk toward
the center of the pit.  If you pull it all the way out of the pit, it will
just walk in a random direction which is not a problem.

It's a bit of a nuisance to do this, but it beats having to run and zone.

Another way to solve this is to have a caster friend do a /assist
on you and cast DD spells on it.  I've heard casters can still
attack while the mob is below the floor of the terrain.  I've never
tried that though.

The pit's a pretty good place to hunt other than that.
