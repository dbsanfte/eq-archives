     I get that too.  My workaround is to start a trade with an NPC or
pet (any item will do, I can still see enough of my inventory overlay
to make out the outlines) and cancel it.  50% of the time I cancel
while the flicker is "on" and the screen sticks that way.  Damn
annoying,
but it looks like I'll have to live with it until I upgrade.  Verant is
apparently considering that my card is simply unsupported rather than
treating it as a bug.
