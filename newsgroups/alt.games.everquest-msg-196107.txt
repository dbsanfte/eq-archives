You get to learn the gentle art of Vendor (or dumpster) diving!

Check vendors, every one in PoK, Nexus, SHadowhaven and paineel. Know
what spells are available. If the vendors are full, you have the
option of seeing if what you want is in there. Sometimes people will
sell cheap crap like grubs or bonechips. Buy them to make the slot
clear.

Now you have two options. Method one is release the vendor, and look
again and see if what you want is there.

The second option requires you have ONE of that word. Sell that to the
vendor, and see if it pops into the window you just emptied. If it
does, buy it back. That means that the vendor does not have HIDDEN
items in its stock. If it disappears the vendor has another hidden and
there are now two of that word at a minimum. Keep buying crap and use
method one to see how long it takes to pop up.

The vendors in PoK often have the items you need, and going to zones
where necros WILL NOT be is a good idea. Felwithe, Kelethin, and
Kaladim comes to mind.

Good luck, and check the bazaar too!
