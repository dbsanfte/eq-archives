How? HOW???  *screams in frustration* My heal spell takes up more mana 
points than it gives hit points back.  You can ask a group-mate of mine - 
the other day she asked for a heal, so I turned around and started 
healing her.  Two minutes later, I was NEARLY done.  I get very nervous 
when I'm the only healer in a group because I know that if someone starts 
going down, I'm not going to be able to keep them alive if there's more 
than one or two mobs on them.  Whereas the healer classes, you turn 
around and BOOM, full health again.  Regen might help, though.  I don't 
get that for a looong time yet, but at least I get an upgrade to my 
healing spell at 19.
