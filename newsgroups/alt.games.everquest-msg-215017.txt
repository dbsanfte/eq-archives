I'm sure that if you have a JBB at the level where it's first useable
(45) it would be almost godlike. It starts to loose it's usefullness
in the high 50s, imo and at 65 I should probably just sell it. Only
reason I haven't is that it's basically a free spell slot for those
rare times I actually want to use a DD, either to break root or just
to add a few points of damage when whatever DoT or Rain that I have
memmed would be overkill. Don't think I'd miss it much but I just
haven't run across a replacement that would make me consider not
wearing it.

Problem with Iksar is that their high wisdom is balanced out by low
stamina. Most races will put 25 starting points into Wis and 5 into
Sta then go for mainly HP/AC gear. An Iksar might be better off to go
the opposite route, 5 into Wis and 25 into Sta. 

At the end of the day, it just doesn't matter though. Ogres have the
no-stun thing, Iksar will have regen and a bit better ac at the high
end, trolls have their regen and snare necklace (not all that useful)
and the other races will have leveled faster. Overall, pretty balanced
imo, nobody ever turns down a shaman because they're the wrong race.
