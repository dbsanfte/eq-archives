For some reason, I was having a bug last night...it caused my monk to have no
animations whatsoever. When I FD'd, he would just stand there and not move.
Same for sitting, and /cheering, /waving, etc. However, when I died, my corpse
got crucified or something, and I found that I could drag it around. The place
I was rez'd in was the 4th floor of Tower of Frozen Shadow, in the crypt
room...so...I took advantage of the situation. I give you...
NIGHT OF THE LIVING CORPSES!
