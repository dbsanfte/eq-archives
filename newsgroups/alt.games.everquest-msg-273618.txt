Seriously though, I agree with each of those points.

Regarding leetspeak, some may assume that it is utilized as a shortcut 
in typing-intensive chat-oriented games, but I'm of the opinion that it 
takes just as much effort to use it, if not more, than just typing what 
you mean. A perfect example is an exclamation punctuated with !!!1!11!!!
one!1!!.

I suppose it could be like shorthand, in that once you get used to using 
it, it really does become a time-saver, but people don't converse using 
shorthand.

I tend to chat with people in a similar manner (though admittedly with a 
mild level of brevity) to how I would converse with them over the phone 
or in person, and I guess I expect the same from others.
