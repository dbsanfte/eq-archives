Where ever did you get the idea that the delay is because they had no backup 
or way to back out to the setup pre-patch?  The devs have stated previously 
that they backup the current state of all players every 30 minutes.  They 
can certainly back up to the previous point prior to Friday morning's patch. 
And you can be quite certain that they'll have an archive of the previous 
pre-patch server build... so that too can be rolled back as necessary.

What, precisely, they are doing in this 24+ hour window only they really 
know.  My assumption, and it is only an assumption, is that they haven't 
quite figured out yet WHAT went wrong with Friday's patch.  Likely, they 
have been working to nail that down to prevent it from happening again when 
the servers do come back up.

On the positive side, the latest update indicates they are bringing Guk up 
shortly to a limited audience.  Once they have enough players in they will 
lock logins again for stability testing.  If all goes well, the rest of us 
can see our servers up in the next few hours.
