Summoned 1HB that has an expendable right click HP -> mana charge, does
about 150 damage to clicker, enough to kill most lower levels unless heavily
twinked w/ +hp gear.

Better yet, give them an amulet of necropotence  and watch them die every
time they loot their corpse  =P

on second though, give ME the amulet so I can sell it and buy some Eboots
and upgrade my wis rings to velium, I want 200 wis, only 171 so far
(untwinked at level 29 too).  =D
