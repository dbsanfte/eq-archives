They are definately not, since I got two different reactions with each of three
characters, and the cleric who came along also got two different reactions.

Troll Shaman (never recieved any faction hits in Luclin to my knowledge):
Dubious outside, KOS inside (not sure which KOS, dead before checking)

Vah Shir Bard (quite  a few faction hits, including hunting the guards outside
and in) indifferent outside, amiable inside

Dwarf Cleric (countless faction hits, including lots of quests in Katta and
vampire killing in TM, but also killing Lcea in Katta) indifferent outside,
apprehensive inside.

If in every case the faction was a step or two worse inside than outside, then
I'd be willing to believe it was the same faction, but with a step modifier
applied to it.  But my bard had it the reverse direction, better indoors than
out.

No, I really wasn't looking or caring at all about the faction hits, would have
been nice to know, but not knowing the respawn time and with a 56 cleric very
exposed, I was all about getting the job done, getting the rez, getting logged
out and getting the other character rezed.  This of course cleared my buffer so
I couldn't go back and look for the faction hits afterwards.

Well I didn't think it was really worth more than a chuckle, except that I
can't think what a "real" person fighting in the zone would do when it happens,
nor how you are supposed to guess that it might.  Go beg help from high level
strangers, I suppose, as has happened to numerous poor people who fell down an
unexpected hole in Befallen.
