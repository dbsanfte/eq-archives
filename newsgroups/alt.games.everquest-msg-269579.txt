Very tempting theory but I don't think that's what's happening. I have a 2nd 
account that I use as my merchant and it's on all day and all night. I can 
tell you from painful experience that my merchant goes down regularly during 
the day and at night. Doesn't seem to me to be any pattern or preference 
here, just the occasional "This zone is currently not available". Hopefully 
this is just bugs that they're still working out.
