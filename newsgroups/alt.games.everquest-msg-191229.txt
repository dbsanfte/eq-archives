If you don't have the other expansions yet (maybe playing on 30 day
trial?).  I'd suggest Unrest.  You can go there about 14th and stay
through 35 or so.  Other places to check out are the Warrens,
Blackburrow & Crushbone.  You might be too high for any of those, but I
find any of them much more fun and definately more proffitable than
Paludal - at least until 20 th lv.
