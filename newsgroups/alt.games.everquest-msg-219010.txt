I think the game *has* been "dumbed down". I think the game was too 
tedious before, and too trivial now, and trivializing things is a form 
of dumbing it down.

There was nothing wrong with traveling as a time sink, per se. It was 
also boring, tedious, and unrewarding.

As much of a feat it was to get from Qeynos to Freeport at low levels, 
without guides and maps past umteen zillion critters that could all one 
punch you the game offered no reward for the journey at all. Now any 
clueless moron with EQAtlas and a level 1 warrior set on walk mode can 
make the trip in complete safety... that constitutes a dumbing down.
