Unless the 'human remains' were created in-situ 10,000 years ago by a
deity bright enough to deplete the carbon a little extra to give the
universe a semblance of additional age.

('human remains' are quoted because this explanation pre-supposes that
they were never alive, but created dead and carbon depleted.
Presumably for a purpose.

Why would a deity do that? Lots of reasons ... a simple and good one
could be the same explanation used to justify the memory implants into
the 'next-generation' replicants in BladeRunner.
