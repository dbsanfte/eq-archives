If I recall, anything you kill to raise Coldain faction will drop giant
faction. However, you can raise Giant faction (at least some of it) by
killing stuff on Claws faction (and vice versa, killing giants will up CoV
and Coldain faction). While you might be able to balance 2 of the factions
okay, I don't think you can become (or stay) non-KoS to all 3, as the
faction hit for a kill is much greater than any gain (about 10 to 1 at a
rough guess).

Not sure about the ring, but the shawl quests can be started at
apprehensive, the later quests may require better faction.

Skyshrine and Kael armour quests require Ally faction, Coldain only requires
Amiable I think (definately better than indiff anyway).
