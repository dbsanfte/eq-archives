Oops. It wasn't yesterday ot was friday.  Here's a peice of the article I
read from AP:

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ After a bankruptcy judge cleared the way, the
ExciteAtHome high-speed Internet network cut service to 850,000 AT&T
Broadband customers early Saturday, but said subscribers to other cable
companies were not immediately affected.

AT&T said it had started transferring its customers to its own network, a
process that could take up to 10 days for some subscribers.

On Friday, a judge cleared the way for the bankrupt ExciteAtHome, with more
than 4 million subscribers, to turn off its high-speed network. Bankruptcy
Judge Thomas Carlson said the company, based in Redwood City, could cancel
existing contracts with cable companies as early as midnight Friday.

The ruling affected many of the nation's largest cable companies, including
AT&T, Cox and Rogers, that sold Internet access through ExciteAtHome's
network.

ExciteAtHome wanted the cable companies to pay substantially higher fees to
connect to its network. Until ExciteAtHome's bankruptcy, the cable companies
had been paying a monthly fee of $12 per subscriber.

By forcing the cable companies to pay more to use the high-speed Internet
service, ExciteAtHome and its bondholders hope to prove the network is worth
substantially more than the $307 million AT&T has bid for it.
