"I'd also bet money that there has never been a case of account hacking
resulting from sniffing packets or from a trojan spying on keystrokes. "

where is my money? the second guy i belive, said he found a trojan horse and
they got his info. only needed time to decrypt.

people seem to think account hackings are rare, they aren't you just arent'
hearing about them. play on nameless, one of my friends and his brother
see/hear about it all the time. this is kinda why this policy is around. 

sigh, but then i know you are going to blame the person who got there stuff
stolen and say, "im sure they did something wrong".

its always the case till happens to you.
