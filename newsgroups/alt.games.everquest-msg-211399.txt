I also have an AMD XP with a 64MB GeForce2 Ti, and I recently
upgraded the RAM from 512MB to 768MB with excellent results.  I
still get some video lag in places, but it is very much reduced.
I expect to be able to pick up a Geforce4 Ti 4200 soon, but in
the meanwhile it's nice to have gotten such a notable improvement
for such a small investment (512MB stick of DDR cost me less than
half what the video card's going for).
