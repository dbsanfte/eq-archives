The problem with EQ CS has always been the GMs, not the guides.

That said, I'd say this senior (is it you, or are you just quoting
it?) had authority problems. That's okay, I do too. It's quite
possible you're correct about the elders - you could write a doctoral
thesis on the social workings of the guide program, why so many women
were promoted beyond their representative numbers, the cluelessness of
the elders, Semiradis's figurehead status and utter inactivity, etc.

There has been rot in the guide program for a long time now. It's
become entranched in egos. Brenlo is a disgrace. The players get bad
service and its the guides who take the fall for it, but the problem
is higher up.

That said, senior Aislyn did flub by quoting PNP at a guide. That's a
no-no.
