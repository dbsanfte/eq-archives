    Guides have told me in the past, when I've mentioned a /report, that
they cannot see it. This was a while ago, though - I haven't used /report
recently.

    If you want effective police on the server (and that's what guides are,
more or less) you never let anyone know what they can or cannot do. The hope
is that people will be so worried about what they COULD do that they won't
break rules. Debate about whether that works or not goes below this line.

    Hang out invis, they'll do it again. Stupidity knows no limits.

    It might not be so bad if the server GM was on more, so those notes were
acted upon. But getting hold of a head GM seems very difficult.

    One of the things I imagine they want to see in /reports is guide
misconduct. Wouldn't be very good if the guides could see that, would it?
And yes, I've caught guide misconduct before - I have a nice screenshot of a
duel message, followed by a /who on the loser and victor. Loser was a
player, victor was a guide. Although I doubt this is why they have the
policy, it does also make sure certain policy matters are handled
consistently (by the same person, anyways) on a given server. Compare this
with my buddy's experience where he petitioned the ogre shaman Fkin, and was
told the name was OK, then made an ogre shaman Fkem and was almost
immediately given an official warning for name violation by a different
person. That frustrates people more than anything else.
