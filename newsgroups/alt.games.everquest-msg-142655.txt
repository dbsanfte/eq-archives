I seem to recall something on the Sony boards a while back about
Verant working on code to share exp among all raid groups present.  I
think this may be the /army command, which is currently not
functional.  Check it out for yourself:  type "/help normal", and sure
enough, one of the commands listed is /army.

Of course, the diluted experience gained would be miniscule, and most
would probably not see a single tick of movement in the exp bar.  But
I sure would like to have *something* to show for some of the raids I
go on where there is no loot available for my cleric.

This may very well be why the /army code has not yet been implemented.
