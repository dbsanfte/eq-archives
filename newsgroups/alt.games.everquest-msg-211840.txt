: With all due respect, Ed, that's a pretty limited view.

I should have added that I acknowledge lots of truly good people
are religious.  But religious people don't have a monopoly on being
truly good.  Some of the best people I know are theists-without-
religion, agnostics, and atheists.

I have to also point out that many religious people do good things
for ultimately greedy reasons; i.e., they want to look good in the
eyes of god, they want to go to heaven, they want to look good in
front of their religious peers, etc.  I'm not convinced they're being
entirely altruistic, although it may appear that way.

I think it's about time people were good to each other because we're
all brothers sharing the same planet and we should learn to get along,
not because some "holy scripture" demanded it of us.
