I want 3, where do I find this NPC?
What does it look like on a Woodelf? Given that, pre Luclin, Wood Elves and
Halflings had no robe graphic. Anyone know?

I liked the look of the Scimitar and Shield that the Kitty Guards have in
Grimling Forest, so I killed one...Took forever, Shiftless deeds needed to
be cast 3 times as it wore off twice. Then found out there was a far easier
way of getting them that involved fighting a much lower level NPC who would
likely give far less of a faction hit, oh well.
