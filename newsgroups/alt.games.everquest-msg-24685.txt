That would be me. My baby necro just dinged 8 and got "gather shadows" hence
the ability to sometimes make it though the Karanas in one peice. I did the
bread run once for a blue bubble and then got wiped out when gather shadows
faded at a bad moment.

I didn't feel like a CR last night, so just switched off with 45 minutes to
go before patch time...

Doh...
