    Stop right there. ZEM is meant to be the "and difficulty" adjustment.
Breaking the Greater Ice Bones spawn solo in lower Guk is much tougher than
pulling, kiting, and killing A Sabretooth Tigress in The Overthere, even
though both mob types have the same level range. Breaking the GIBs may be
pretty easy with a reasonable group, but I guarantee you that same group
will have an absolutely trivial time chain-pulling crap in The Overthere and
laying waste to everything in sight. ZEM gives the people that take more
relative risk a better XP reward.

    The rest of the world is empty for a lot of reasons, ZEM only being a
part of it. I was alone in a ZEM 85 (above average) zone last night, soloing
multiple low blues that had abyssmal HPs/AC/ATK for the level, which dropped
more cash than I'd seen in many levels of Dawnshroud Mountains hunting. So
why is that Dawnshroud group avoiding Sol B? It isn't the ZEM.
