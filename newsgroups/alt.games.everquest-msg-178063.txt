Here is the cooler I use...

http://www.thermaltake.com/products/heatsink/v9.htm

It can be found online for @25.00 (www.newegg.com)

The beauty of this cooler is the fan controller. You can adjust the
speed from silent to Jet Engine :-P. Once you get your heat problem
under control you can set the fan to the quietest speed possible and
still maintain safe system temps. You just need to make sure you have
room for it in your case. It is pretty big.

Also try to pick up some "Artic Silver" thermal compound. It rates
really high, and I have always had good luck with it. A thin layer
(just enough to keep air from getting between the CPU and HS/Fan is
all that is required.

Not when you get to the XP1800 and up processors. Luckily most of the
cooling devices are much cheaper now than they used to be.
