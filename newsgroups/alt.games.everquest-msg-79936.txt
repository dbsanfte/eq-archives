Find a spot where you jump off and take a few points damage.  Keep doing
that.  Your SF skill will start to go up.  You'll stop taking damage soon,
but just keep doing it...it doesn't matter if you DID take damage, it only
matters that you WOULD HAVE taken damage without safe fall.

Don't bother. H2H is a MNK/BST skill.  You're welcome to work on it if your
only reason is to be laughed at by monks & beasts.

> 3.  Do skills go up when dueling?

No.  Duelling has very little practical use (and by the time it becomes
practical you'll know of the 1 reason you might want to duel someone besides
to kill time).

Just practice while you're fighting.  Stop fighting a moment, hit the
button, start fighting again.

I don't want to guess at what it is, I'll only embarass myself.  It's a
defensive skill though...the higher it is, the less you'll be hit.  Yes,
it's automatic, and be patient for messages.

If

Three attacks. Dual wield (watch the spelling) is automatic but backstab is
not...it'd be kinda hard to tell the game, "don't dual wield this fight, I'm
gonna try backstabbing."
