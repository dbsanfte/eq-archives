179.99 every two weeks wouldn't pay for your DSL?  More realistically,
do you really think it would take 344 hours to level to 60?  And who
says you can only powerlevel one at a time?  I would think you could
quite easily powerlevel 5 or even 10 at a time.  If this were a popular
business I think you could actually make some serious money...if you
had the customers.  Someone putting in 12 hours a day could get
characters to 60 in 4 or 5 days I would think--a week at worst.

Best way to do it, in my opinion, would be to put 5 characters in a
group with someone 150% their level and have that one character grind
away against mobs that are trivial to them but red/yellow to the
others.  Maybe use monster missions, maybe not.  But it's all in the
economies of scale.  He never did guarantee your characters would have
skilled-up defense, casting, or weapon's skills, did he?
