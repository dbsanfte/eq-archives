*shrug*
Get a weapon that procs Root.  Back off and use your clicky-heal
item whenever it goes off.  Do all your fighting near a zone line.
Don't compare your rate of xp gain to a Necro/Shaman/Druid without
first downing a six-pack (or equivalent) to ease the pain.
-OR-
Partner with that dumbass Paladin you see soloing since that'll
easily double his rate of xp gain even though he has to share
half with you.  Actually, at your level soloing probably doesn't
work for Paladins anymore, tanking unslowed mobs doesn't exactly
get easier as you gain levels.  I'll be surprised if I can still
get <any> xp solo post-60 (leaving out my surprise should I ever
actually ding 61).
