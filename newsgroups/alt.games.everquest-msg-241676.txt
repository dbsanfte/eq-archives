I like Wizbang. Very comprehensive review (I'd already read it, friend of
mine is in the Blizzard can and never has done wrong camp). I ain't touching
that game with a 10 foot pole. Well.. I applied for beta, but I apply for
every beta (A note: Wish by Mutable realms is not all that good imo, but it
was very stable. I guess what I really didn't like was the non-remapable
point and click pathfinding control system.). I'm sorry, I've always
respected Blizzard for the appearance and stability of their games, but I've
never found them particularly fun. And I've always felt that in the non-MMOG
online arena they've been pretty much clueless as to the issues with their
software. I'll probably be one of those people hanging around and playing EQ
3-4 months a year when the 10th anniversery comes around, when as a server
event they make an instanced version of The Sleeper for 85th level full AA
Single groups to kill, just to say they did, and the allow LDoN points to
buy the final part to my epic, and my 59th level enchanter will be content
soloing in lower guk.

What's that sonny? In my day we had to settle for KEI. No 55 mana per tick
regen for us, no-sir.

Of course who knows? I may end up in WoW eventually anyway.

As far as the double addictions, I like Star Wars dammit! And I'm going to
enjoy myself even if I make my ulcer bleed and have an anurism doing it!
And Final Fantasy I have a core groups of 3 other friends that we just play
one or two nights a week. Or we did. We've been missing one some... his
computer went kaput. But it was feeling much better Monday.

I don't want to come back to EQ... Hell, I gave away my stuff... the
droppable stuff.

/emote casts fear on the debit card, tryiing to drive it back to it's lair.
