When you get near them. They are distance sensitive. If you are a
reasonable distance away, they seem to just keep doing their little
gyrating dance and will ignore you all day long. However, if you get
within "melee range" of them, (and it's a pretty small box on these
plants, thank god) then they grab you and tear you up.

Have read about (though not see, so this is purely anecdotal) a level
sixty getting snagged by one of these guys. I don't think they give a
rat's patootie about your level. They're just mindless killing machines.
