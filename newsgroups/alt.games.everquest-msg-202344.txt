Common is always language 1 so you can hotkey "/language 1" to switch
to Common quickly.  The master list is numbered in a set order but I
don't have access to give that order right now. Characters learn
languages  /language 2, /language 3, /language 4, etc. but the numbers
do not refer to the order in which they learned the languages nor to
their skill.    

Your character's language list contains only the languages your
character knows. When you start an Iksar, you start knowing Iksar,
Dark Speech and Common; Iksar would be language 2.  When you start a
Halfling, Halfling will language 2.  When either the Halfling or Iksar
character learns the Barbarian language, then Barbarian would become
language 2. (Barbarian is language 2 on the master list.) The other
languages would change numbers.
