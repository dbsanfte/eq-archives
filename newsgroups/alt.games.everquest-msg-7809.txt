It might not be as bad an idea as it sounds. If you want to learn about PvP,
where else is there to learn. I haven't been involved in any PvP in EQ, but
I am involved in a fair bit of it in UO.

The only thing that sharpens you up in that, is practice, and lots of it.
You have to switch into a certain frame of mind, and it gets easier with
practice. I assume that EQ would be the same for PvP.
