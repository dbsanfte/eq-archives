Wrong.  Declining prices cannot hurt the buyer unless they decline
so far that nobody bothers to pharm/make the item in question.

There're a lot of sheep out there.  Best profits are never made by the
sheep.  Waiting a week to sell itemX at 125% of the price you could sell
in an hour for only makes sense if there is nothing better for you to
do with that fraction of your wealth over the 167 hours that it is
sitting idle waiting for a buyer for itemX.  When I was actively bazaar
trading I was always undercutting somebody (tho rarely was I selling at
lowest price) while keeping an eye out for deeply discounted items I
could resell for a decent profit (again, I would resell lower than the
going price).  So, if your bazaar mule is nothing but a vending bot,
then your approach makes sense, RL gasoline retailers make good $$ off
the same sort of tacit quasi-monopolistic behavior.  Interestingly it
also helps to create the environment in which an active bazaar trader
can make amazing profits.
