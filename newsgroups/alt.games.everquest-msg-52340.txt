I find it ironic then that even verant is making corpse recovery and
such in Star Wars Galaxies exactly like in DAOC and AO and such. Its a
combination of being able to insurance save like in AO but having to
loot your corpse like in other games if you got sometthing new on it.
You DO have the stuff on you that was on you when saving though. They
also talk of less downtime in doing everything than EQ, and random
spawns, loot, new creatures coming when you kill the "nest." etc. In
other words at this point Verant themselves saying why you need to run
to your corpse nine zones away or other players saying why you need to
do that is ironic. Evidently verant themselves thinks you should not
have to but is of course not about to spend time redoing EQ.

They have learned from EQ like everyone else has. People by and large
want to play a GAME. By and large the money people spend on the game
is money they earn themselves so lets assume at least half the players
have full time jobs. People on full time jobs just don't have the time
to spend a large portion of the 2 hours they have to play  in downtime
related activities. AO was a pretty horrible game and was released way
too early but it really got the corpse and insurance save thing down
right.
