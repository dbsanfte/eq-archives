Honestly, I've not heard of anyone running with shadows on. I turned them 
on just to see what they were like, and found them to be poorly done, 
anyway. There was no softening of the edges in softer light, and they 
seemed to be present even in the absence of a direct light source. Add that 
to the fact that they create a lot of lag, and it may well go down as the 
worst graphics "feature" ever implemented. I don't know what they were 
thinking.
