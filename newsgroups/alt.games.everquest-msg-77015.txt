He was most definately rooted, and although I didn't run a log
that night, he was definately hitting slower.  Also, this was months
ago, before the patch that made  mobs able to be totally immune
to some spells while being affected by others.  So it may not work
now, although like I said, it not only worked once, but after it broke,
I was able to reapply it and have it stick again.  It definately made
a difference in the fight.
