    And it's nice to see what that first Archetype AA is that you're
getting. =) Have you been able to see the difference yet?

    As for the HP thing, I agree. I know you're working up resists (going to
HoT with the new guild?), but you'll need the HPs just as much for those
mobs that sneak through the resists. This is my necromancer's profile, to
give you an idea why I think you're a little behind there:

    Yeah, I mean to replace the velium fire ring with a Shadel Bandit ring,
but my sales ENC has one so it keeps getting put off.

    So, some ideas on things to look out for as far as HP improvement, etc.:

    Ear: Electrified Earring of Tempests, AC 7 HP/MANA 35 FR/MR/CR 12. It's
a JC item, and most folks that can get the pieces actually look down on the
stats. So you might be able to get one for cheap or gather components for a
guildmate to combine.
    Head: not an easy slot, as even the Velious quest hats aren't so hot.
The Platinum Tiara should be cheap and relatively mana-neutral. There's also
the Enchanted Dew Woven Circlet, off a Jaggedpine named, but I know nothing
about difficulty or frequency. It just looked like a good fit for your
desired stat set.
    Ring: I'd look into a Shadel Bandit ring to replace the Diamond Wedding
Band. The HPs off that are huge, you'll gain net MANA, and the resists are
close to a wash.
    Wrist: lose the Loam and try and get a Wristband of Strategy: AC 8 all
saves 10 HP/MANA 30. It's exactly what you're looking for, and they aren't
terribly expensive. Especially not for someone that can farm like almost no
other class. ;-)
    Back: more than a few possible replacements. Cloak of the Maelstrom (if
you can handle the weight!), Iksar Hide Cape, Coterie General Cape. The last
is usually 1 K or less in The Bazaar, the others hover in the 5 K range.
There's also a Cloak of Shimmering Water, off another named in Jaggedpine,
but again I know nothing of frequency or difficulty.

    That's about all I can suggest without possibly changing what stats you
currently seem to value. There's about 200 HPs there, so it should be a good
start before the raid drops start coming in. You can do Cazic Thule the zone
at your level, so look into the drops there. There's lots of good stuff like
Dreadfang's Hide that you'd just love, but which are out of the price range
I'd consider reasonable.

    And most importantly of all, have fun. You're at a level where you can
go many, many places and see and do many things. Take advantage of it! =)
