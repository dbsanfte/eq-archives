>Considering everquest.  Coming down from D2...

Coming up from D2, you mean

>1. What is the current state of everquest? Is it buggy? Has it degenerated

Not at all buggy. It isn't a flaming hate filled mosh pit. Although sometimes
this NG is. I'd say it's in a state of high refinement. There are few things
that could use fixing, though.

>2. How to get started? Buy which package of software? Is there a package
>that brings you up to date with the current goodies or do I have to buy
>Everquest 1.0 and additional software?

I suggest buying the "original" package ($10 for the game itself, no Kunark or
Velious--Kunark and velious allow you to travel to different continents and
Kunark lets you play as Iksar, or lizardmen) from everquest.com, then if you
like the game, purchasing Kunark--and if you find yourself really liking the
game, later purchasing Velious. Velious requires higher levels than kunark.

Depends on your connection - dialup, a few hours maybe.

Depends on who you ask. To me the game is about having fun with friends and
advancing my character item-and-level wise. It's important to have a balance.
You can form your own opinion, though.

>Or, on the other hand, is ANarchy Online fixed yet? That one really sounds

<shrug> It's all about what you like. It sure isn't bug-free. Eventually,
though, it will be. Would you rather play a fantasy-based MMORPG or a sci-fi
one?
