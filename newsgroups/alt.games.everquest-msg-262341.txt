I detest bottom posting. The fact that it is a holdover from the old 
Teletype machine days does not make it good.

Since people are in the habit of copying dozens or even hundreds of lines of 
text from previous messages, it seems really totally stupid to me to 
continually scroll down past a dozen previous snippets to see that some guy 
says "I agree"
