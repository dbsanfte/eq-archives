Ok now I recognize the name,
I have a personal experience to share.
Last year my mom committed suicide and for the longest time I looked for
someone to blame (my stepfather her doctors even went so far as to try my ex
girlfriend) I came to realize (wtihout the advice of legal council I might
add) that her death was noone's fault but her own. I realized this and have
moved on with my life. My point is while yes suicide is tragic and leaves a
scar (not a day goes by when I dont think about her) it's not the fault of
someone else Sony did not make her son pull the trigger just like my ex or
my stepfather did not make my mother pull the trigger. I feel her pain for
her loss and despise her for the inability to accept the fact that he did it
to himself and move past it
Thats all I have to say about that
