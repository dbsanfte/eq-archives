Somewhat true.  I don't see a way to force parents to teach ther kids 
without in some way violating their rights in a way I would equally 
disapprove of.  In the absence of that, the 'half-assed' soution gets 
promoted to 'the best we've got'.

I'm open to suggestions, though.  How do you suggest we get parents to 
teach these things?
