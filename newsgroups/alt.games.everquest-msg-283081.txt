As it was explained to me or I read, 32 bit XP has a 4GB memory space
from which all memory addresses are taken. ALL memory addresses --
program ram, rom, video ram, etc. So even though 4 GB of RAM is
available, the amount of RAM available to the OS is likely to be much
less as part of the 4GB won't be addressable.

I also read that going over 2 GB can be problematic for 32 bit XP.
Having said that, I have 3 GB installed on my MB and have not noticed
any problems (since RAM and Mobos are likely differnt from yours YMMV)
but I haven't checked to see how much of it is useable.

64 bit XP does not have that limitation, I understand.
