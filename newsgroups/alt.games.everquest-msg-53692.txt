  Indeed.  What I meant was "Don't repeatly kill-steal
on purpose".  Everyone has KS before, I believe.  I know
I have.  I blast a bat that looks likes it at full 
health, then when I get close to it I see the level 2
warrior looking forlornly at it.  Others have done the
same to me. Also, if I'm a level 5, I'm not going to 
bitch if someone "steals" the lion I'm running from.
   No, what I'm talking about deliberate Kill-Stealing.
I haven't seen it happen all that often, but when it 
does, it is obvious.
