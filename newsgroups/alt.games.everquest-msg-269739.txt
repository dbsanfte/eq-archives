But how much damage could everyone have been doing by continuing to
unload on the mob during that 10 to 20 seconds? Much more than the
benefit of a successful HO would be worth, it would seem.

That was what I thought too, but then I joined a group where we worked
well with the HOs.  Basically, you don't really have to wait to cast
your spell, just don't put spells in queue.  Our HOs would happen in a
span of 3 or 4 seconds, our DPS was immense, things were going down in
a fraction of the time and us using a fraction of the power.  This was
a pickup group too, but I haven't been able to repeat that feat with
other groups
