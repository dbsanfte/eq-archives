Your character moving will interrupt a spell even more often than a hit.

I know you said that you stopped, but it still happens due to the way that
the game deals with movement.  To lesesen the effects of lag, the server
assumes that you are moving in the same direction at the same speed, until
it receives a message from your client telling it that you are not.  If you
stop and cast a spell immediately, the server will receive the "start
casting" message before it receives the "stop moving" message.   Therefore
it considers you to have moved while casting, and interrupts your spell.

If you are running, you can take a short pause after stopping but before
casting.   There is also a bit of a trick you can do.   Once you stop
running, immediately turn a bit.    A turn is an event that immediately
sends a direction update from the client to the server.   In this case that
you have stopped forward movement and are turning to the right.  So as long
as you turn before casting, the server should be aware that you have stopped
moving and allow you to cast without being interrupted.

Of course, if you're not running before casting, none of this is necessary.





And while it may be a stupid question...  you did remember to train in
channeling at level 4, right?   I've known a few people that made it to
startlingly high levels before realizing they do not learn it automaticly,
and have to buy the first point.
