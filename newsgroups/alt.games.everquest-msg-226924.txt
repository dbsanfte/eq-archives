You do raise some very good points, but I thought we were discussing the 
pros and cons of a randoming system and the chances of getting *any* 
drops.

*sigh* Easy on the trigger. Perhaps I shouldn't have left out the term 
"dedication", because I certainly didn't mean it the way you took it. I'm 
not talking about quality of the guild here (I wasn't back then either, 
but that's another story). I'm comparing, for example, Guild A that has 
10 of 60 members who attend most raids and the other 50 jump in whenever 
compared to Guild B where say, 40 of 60 of the members try to attend most 
raids with the rest filling in when they can. Guild A may well have a lot 
of their frequent raiders discouraged, because a lot of the loot *would* 
go to lesser attending members, while the same system in Guild B might 
appear to work well.

The whole idea of a randoming system probably becomes completely 
impractical at the high end anyway, due to the number of NODROP loot 
items.
