Totally understood.  In the "olden days" my druid kited and dot'd.  Then they
changed things and she started root rotting.. (much better, no worries about
other groups.)  Then KEI came along and I half root rot and half blast the crap
outa them suckers.  Leveling goes much faster.  Who's going to go back to the
"old way"?  I can't imagine my druid soloing without KEI now. 
The first thing my cleric gets asked in a group is, "do you have KEI?  I wonder
if we can get you one..."  And keep in mind, my cleric can ill afford 50 plat
for KEI at level 25... who do these groups think is going to PAY for the KEI? 
This *does* kind of bother my cleric, who prefers to "pay her own way".
