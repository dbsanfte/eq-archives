I'm undercutting at 4pp/apiece.  The average price in the bazaar on CT is 5.
I figure 80 plat for a 5 plat investment is a good enough ROI. ;-)

I don't do it so regularly that it becomes a trend ... once a week or so
I'll whip up a batch and drop them on the mule.  Wouldn't want to drive the
price down .......

The thing that gets me is that there's absolutely nothing about 'em that has
to be farmed ... everything you need to make the product is readily
available from vendors, and the trivial on them is pretty low.  It takes me
about 30 minutes to make 5 stacks, take them to the mule, take the mule down
for the trade, and re-establish the mule.  And less than 30 minutes after
it's done, the mule is 400 plat better off.

Yay for lazy folks! :-)
