I'm a level 12 scholar.  I got a tradeskill task that wants me to make "10 
middling caustic assault".  The picture next to the order looks like a rune. 
I found a "caustic" scroll on the chemistry table and am wondering if this 
is the right thing.  Is there a "caustic assault" also that I'm not seeing? 
I've looked on every table and been to the internet searching.  I don't want 
to waste my components on the wrong thing.

Also, my friend who also does tradeskiling is able to buy stroma wash at the 
vender in the tradeskill instance and it is not available to me.  Is this 
because she has completed her tradeskill work order?  Does completing this 
quest make more things available to you to buy?  And if so, is there a list 
of the things that become available to you if you complete the task, maybe 
on the internet somewhere?

Thanks,

Abby
