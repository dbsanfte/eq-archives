But they are "Drow" more or less....

In the years I've been playing I've had a few DE characters (it's my
favorite race /w Barbarians) and I take great pride in proclaiming that they
are Drow...hehe

I guess it's all rp perspective....

Granted that it wasn't until my lovely Gf got me hooked on AD&D that I did
so though (she knows who she is)....

Currently I have a DE SK that I am enamored with and when doing so I always
refer to myself as Drow...

Then again, like said before I guess it's a matter of RP perspective....
