If that is the case (and it is a good idea on paper), then the odds
are someone will figure out how to predict or increase the odds of
hitting the right combination. Such a system would really only benefit
power gamers. People who can play 24/7 and play with as many skill
combos as possible.

Agreed, and then they are likely to quit. There is almost nothing
unobtainable in EQ with enough time and effort. Which is one of the
reasons why it has endured.  Frustrating a LOT (if not most) of the
Jedi-wannabe's is just bad business.

No doubt this will be EXTREMELY common.

I personally would NEVER buy/sell an EQ account/item. Why should I? I
can "earn" anything I want in-game if I am willing to spend the time
and effort to get it. It's a win-win....I play a game I enjoy and get
the rewards I seek.

After reading about how hard it can/will be to become a Jedi in SWG, I
find myself considering the option of buying an account/character
after the game goes live. Based on thier description of the process I
am MUCH better off buying a "jedi" than wasting time/effort in the
hopes of getting lucky. Since there is no guarantee that I will get to
play the class I want (even after months of time invested), the smart
thing to do is to buy a "Jedi". Then I can enjoy the game and play the
class I want to play. 

People don't play a game hoping to win a "lottery". You can't dangle a
carrot in front of peoples noses and at the same time tell them that
only a select few will actually get to eat it. Can you imagine working
on a character for months with the goal of becoming a Jedi only to
find out that some newbie got lucky on his first day or week playing
or worse yet bought the character?

That is a fatal flaw if I ever saw one. You only have to look at the
hatred in EQ for "droods" to see where SWG is headed. 

>	Basically, they're screwed.

/agree 

I simply don't see a logical way to satisfy what customers will want
(to be a Jedi), and at the same time restrict it to being a "presitge"
class.
