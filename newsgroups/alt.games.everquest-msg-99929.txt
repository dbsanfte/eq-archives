I don't recall which races get the "hide" skill, but if you can find one
that does, that's what I'd recommend.

BTW, the KOS thing hasn't bothered my Dark Elf Wizard much.  There are a
couple of NPCs in Freeport that attack, and a couple in Qeynos, and pretty
much all of Halas, but none of these are important (except part of the
Wizard epic is in Halas...that will be a bit of a pain).  (Oh, and Rivervale
is very KOS to me, but that is because I helped a Cleric do some quests that
involved killing Halflings...an agnostic Dark Elf who doesn't do anything to
screw Rivervale faction is OK *except* near the Clerics guild, and you can
get past that pretty easily).

There are a fair number of merchants that won't deal with Dark Elves,
including the caster merchants in Katta Castellum, which is annoying.
(Based on the Luclin storyline, shouldn't Katta merchants like Dark Elves?)

And remember, there are NPCs that are KOS to the so-called good races, that
like Dark Elves.  It's fun to spend your low teens in West Commans, calmly
meditating unmolested while Uncle Kizdean and Uncle Zytl have their fun.

Don't rule out Dark Elves just because of the KOS thing.
