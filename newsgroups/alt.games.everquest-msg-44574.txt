Here's a tip: practice conjuration. At level 14 you get your first
"swarm" DoT, Stinging Swarm. You will want to use it without fizzling
ten times first. Other than the light-source summoning spells which
you probably did not buy, Whirling Wind is it for now. I didn't like 
Whirling Wind since it was resisted like crazy, but you are well 
advised to use it anyway to get those conjuration points.
