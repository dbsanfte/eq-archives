And your point is.....????

Who the hell gives a rat's ass? If anyone is stupid enough to even try
to harass someone in RL because their little feelings were hurt by
something that was typed, then go right ahead, but who the fuck really
cares? Is your penis any bigger now that you've done this? Are you all
of a sudden smarter? Richer? Less of a fetid piece of filth stuck to the
bottom of someone's shoe? Nope. So I say again, who the hell gives a
rat's ass?
