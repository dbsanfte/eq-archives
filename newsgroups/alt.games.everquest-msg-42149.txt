And here again we have someone stereotyping everyone who plays a specific
class.
If your "necro" has an attitude problem it is the PERSON not the class.

If we want to stereotype lets do it right.....
Wizards are all a bunch of egomaniacal, self-important dolts.

Rangers are all a bunch of limpwristed fruits.

Druids are all a bunch of money grubbing, selfish buggers.

Mages are all a bunch of cowards that will run/gate at the first hint of
trouble.

Warriors are all troglodytes, without enough brain power to use a light
switch.


Get the picture yet? It is the PERSON not the class.
