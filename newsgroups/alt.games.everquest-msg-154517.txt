Some of her pieces have less hit points, and that leaves her a bit on the
low side, but as far as armor class all of the pieces (which seem pretty
common to me) are superior to the ToV stuff by a large margin.  Doesn't have
a BoB yet.   Maybe we'll have to work on that.  And get her the stamina
bracer from umbral, instead of the agi/dex one.
