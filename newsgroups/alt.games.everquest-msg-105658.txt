Oh c'mon TH, there is hope you know.  I actually read a post by Ben
in which he admitted that an assertion of his was probably wrong (one
of the surname threads I think).  Of course, he did thrash a bit first,
but when several different people claimed results different from his
he did, in fact, retreat.  Unless, of course, somebody was spoofing.
Maybe I should check the headers in case it was an obvious spoof.  ;)
Oh, and have you seen his keen new sig?  rofl
