Neither, both are flawed. AO is probably the least corpse/downtime
intensive though. You more or less move around pretty well fairly
fast, you control your death loss by insurance booth saving (saves
items and xp) if you get a brand new item on you and die its probably
gone but usually even then if you had it for a bit its on you at the
save booth anyway. You have gradually increasing medical and mana
packs which keep you constantly doing things even if soloing.

Not that sure about the economy in AO, it seemed pretty balanced
though. You end up making a lot of credits eventually grouping or
soloing but medical packs or mana packs cost more and more so it seems
you are spending the same percentage amount of your resources at level
5 as you are at level 35, as a doctor/martial artist.. for example. So
in this way its pretty balanced. People actually seem to sell armor
they outgrow pretty cheaply too which is stuff you'd have to get alone
in a mission otherwise.

Not sure why its getting such raids though, maybe most of the problems
are gone but during the free month of december, I only logged in
twice. It really seemed pretty mucht the same to me as when I quit in
september, but I may not have given it a fair chance.

You can look pretty darn unique in AO, which is a good thing, but the
problem with that is that the nearly unlimited combination of possible
unique textures on characters mean that if 15 new people go by you
they can graphically lag you into a nightmare. This makes the memory
demands of AO pretty darn high.. I'd say, kind of like EQ, 512 meg
memory is about right and it certainly will use even more than that.

From what I hear DAOC has less of a hassle in playing it than EQ does,
but is not as easy as AO. Its economy also sounds pretty good since
players can actually make quality armor which is cheaper for you to
buy than similar armor at the stores, which is the way it should be.
EQ is the opposite in this regard in nearly everyway (what people can
make is crap until they get to such a high difficulty point, both in
finding drops to make things and in time spent skilling up, that they
need to charge astronomical prices on anything worth making at all
even though its usually outclassed by mana dropping regular items)

Most people I know, like myself, did not play AO for long at all and
were then back in EQ. Most people I know who left EQ for daoc had fun
with it for about 3 - 5 months then felt they had exhausted its
possibilities and came back to EQ. So I really don't know what to tell
you ;) I don't think either of these games has the longevity that EQ
does for the average player and I know they don't have anywhere near
the content. They both are evolutionary though in terms of downtime
lessening and faster overall play, especially AO. They are not what
you'd call "revolutionary" but are rather just the next step until
games like Star Wars Galaxies (due in the fall)
