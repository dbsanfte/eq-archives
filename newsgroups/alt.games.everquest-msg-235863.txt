Trolls are cool and all, but a lot of troll players are
disappointed/pissed off by the fact that, even at level 65, the Troll
warder looks small compared to everyone else's. Mainly because they're
low to the ground, plus their size is measured head to tail. It's been
the source of flamewars among the BST community, some people getting
sick of the "oh, how SOE abuses us!" whining from the trolls...

Ogre bears get absolutely HUGE, though...but, nose to end length isn't
really bigger. They end up taller than the ogre by level 65.
