Like the ultradeath spells, the april's fool spell, all your base are
belong to us, and proection of cabbage? :)
I haven't seen that website, but I do have a spdat parser.

The version in the spdat is level 59, but honestly, even though I
carry lucky cabbages around with me, I wouldn't want to see a spell go
live with a name like Protection of Cabbage :)
Also, if a single target PotG were to become available (I think they
have it on Test), it couldn't be lower than 59 or 60 - we get our
second highest buff of that line, natureskin, at 57.
