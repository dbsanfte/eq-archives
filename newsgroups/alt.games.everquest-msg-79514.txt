Orions Outpost had a great start!
Thanks for all the suggestions, guys ;)

New Items:
* Starships will be getting some new goodies, like "droids".
* Deep Space Navigation is now a sector by sector function.
* You'll have to be in the same sector to attack anyone thats in Deep Space.
* The "Universe" will be 2500 sectors.
* The planets will be dynamic now.
Meaning they will produce for whoever owns them.
If someone else owns it, you'll have to take it away from him or you can't
land.
* You will be able to place certain *things* within the sectors ;)
* Battlestar wars will cost less in fuel consumption.

Some of the changes will be implemented shortly after the reset.
(I'm expanding the database at reset)

We just reset Jan. 15th at midnight.
See ya there!
