Actually, I was thinking about this at work, after I posted my initial
message.  By Sony's thinking here, let me in to VT NOW!  I paid for
the expansion, I deserve it.  Same for ST, I shouldn't have to put the
same work in for keys that everyone else has.  Let me in right now!
Caving so completely on the flagging system for PoP just leaves them
open for criticism and demands for change on other "locked" content.
