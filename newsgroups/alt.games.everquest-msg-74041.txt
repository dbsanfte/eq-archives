At 56 I have 16ac arms. The easy available alternative seems to be
crystal chitin which folk want 8k or so for. Now, if I had 0ac on
my arms that might be fine, but I have no drop arms so its a hard 8k
for a 2ac upgrade for me at the moment, and, frankly, I'd rather
save for a better weapon ratio or MQ some CoV quest armour or some
such as  I have all the gems.

I realise this isnt quite what we were originally talking about, but
I'm sorta, in a roundabout kinda way, making the point that AC isnt
*everything*. You want haste, damage output, resists, etc, and you
always want to balance how much you could improve other things against
it.

If, say, the choice is from 19ac to 25ac on the chest (substantial
imptovement) or losing 5ac from the waist and gaining 20% hasste
for the same pp investment the choice isnt as clearcut as "increase
ac by 11"... haste increases damage, taunt, etc,etc. I know, I know,
you know this, I know.... ;p
