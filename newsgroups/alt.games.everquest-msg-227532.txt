I don't think there ever was a banker in Befallen. The real
plat exploit was appearing and disappearing on various
boards last week as moderators found it, and I think the
Befallen story was just a smoke-screen to get plat hungry
noobies to jump down the well in Befallen (where they would
most certainly die or get stuck because you need a key to
get out that they wouldn't be able to get ;) )

Same with the shared bank one... when people are spending
their time doing that, they're not doing the real exploit.
