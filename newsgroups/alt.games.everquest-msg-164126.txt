Because you sUxx0rz?
:-)

I imagine that over a sustained period of time, the shammy will
outdamage some casters, though a good necro or mage will probably own.

Damage calculations in DPS are useless unless you put it in reference of
a specific period of time.  Give me a 8 second window only and I'll
outdamage anybody else of my level with my wizard. If you stretch the
window too much further, I'll start falling behind. Take it to the
length of even a moderately high HP mob and I'm left in the dust.
