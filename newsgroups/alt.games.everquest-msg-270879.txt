AO was likely hit pretty hard by EQ2 and WoW too; I doubt they are 
explicitly looking for discontent EQ1ers, but its convenient for us.

Even if we assumed that EQ1 + E2 has not 1 single account more than just 
EQ1 used to. (Which is unlikely, the total market size is probably 
larger.)

EQ2 is higher ARPU (average return per unit) as its another 15%+ in 
subscriptions fees.

EQ2 likely has lower development/maintenance costs as its a newer 
codebase with less of a legacy of bad design decisions to cope with, it 
likely even already has many 'hooks' in place for planned features.

EQ1 has little potential to compete with WoW and other new MMOG 
offerings for new players. They needed to move forward just to stay 
where they were, so to speak.

SOE likely plans to pull the plug on EQ1 when EQ2 proves it will 
survive. They will likely offer some small incentive to EQ1 players to 
bump them over. Sooner or later EQ1 will not be worth maintaining, even 
if it continues to be modestly profitable.

Heh. Sadly that's always true. The local movie theatre takes all the 
revenue from the last year and upgrades their theatre, and then raises 
ticket prices.... it happens everywhere you look.
