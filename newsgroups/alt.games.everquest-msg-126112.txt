Levels 20 to 23...
Paludal Caverns.  Just past the Bandit camp on the right is an Elder Sensate
Reishi.  Park yourself on the ledge above it.  From there, you can grab 4
spawn easily w/o the bandit campers screaming that you are stealing their
spawn (when there are 12 or so that they can't keep clear, but that's
another story).  The 4 spawn are 2 Patogs (one wanders down to you and one
at the top of the ramp), One bandit on the little island across from you,
and the sensate reishi.  They are on a 5 minute timer and you should not get
adds (unless trained).  You can also single pull or double pull bandits when
you hit 22 or 23 and the mana is still near full.

My tactic was to pull with darkness, shadow vortex, send in pet, fear, tap,
leach.  If anything bad happened, I'd FD.

Spell lineup was 1)Allure of Death, 2)Shielding/Focus Death/Spirit Armor, 3)
Feign Death, 4)Fear, 5)Tap, 6)Leach, 7) Shadow Vortex/Heat Blood, 8)Eng.
Darkness

I used HB on the yellow and white/blacks only.  You can add Banshee Aura to
the rotation, if you want to tank a bit, but the mobs are slow.

For levels 24 to 27, go to Echo Caverns and hunt the Needlites.  7 in the
room on a 20 minute timer.  Only 2 are linked.  Same basic spell lineup, but
Banshee Aura is essential.  The hit fast (parsed at 10 or 11 delay)  and you
will do almost 1/3 of the damage wuth your harmshield.  I draw with
darkness, then tap, tap, tap, leach.  Forget any other DoTs.  They will be
useless as the fights all last under 1 min.  At 24 the Queen qill be red,
about half of teh regulars will be yellow, and the rest white/black.  At 26,
Queen will be yellow, 2 will be white/black, the rest will be blue.
I entered the room and walked left along the wall to the corner.  That was
the camp spot and nothing will aggro you there.  Loot is ok, and exp is
amazing.  1 yellow plus per room clear at 24, 2 1/2 to 3 blues at 27.

Good Hunting
