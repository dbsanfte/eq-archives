    The new spells have already hit Lucy, so if you were curious you could
see what you're getting already. Most of it is evolutionary, not
revolutionary, things like lower-level versions of Aegolism.

    The funny part is they haven't even told us much about the expansion
itself. Bank capacity, LFG tool, NPC journal, armour dyes, guild management
system, cartography system - these are all general gameplay changes that
could just as easily have been introduced with a general patch. They're
being tied to the expansion to boost sales, of course, but they aren't
really part of the expansion in that the expansion could happen without any
of them going live and it wouldn't change game play.

    The stuff that is being added, other than zones, is pretty easy to do
because it's all been done before. The new playable race doesn't have
exceptional stats or any overpowered special abilities, new creature models
have been done several times in the past, the spells don't have to radically
increase player power so it's easy to keep them balanced. They've even had
experience adding character slots with stats, having added two (food and
drink) recently.

    What will make or break this expansion is the zones, and that's what I'm
waiting to see. Right now the "general target of levels 35 to 60" means that
the frogloks will not have a new newbie area, but will use an existing
newbie area or have an area internal to the starting city. It'll be
interesting to see how that develops. There's also a lot of room in "35 to
60" - that takes you from Iceclad and Great Divide difficulty all the way up
to Vex Thal difficulty. It is quite possible to create dungeons with level
65 XP group areas and level 60 raid areas, and that's what I'm hoping will
happen. I'll say right now that if the expansion doesn't address post-62 XP
crowding, it will be considered a failure no matter what else it contains.

    A lot of this stuff has been tested elsewhere, like the guild management
system. Also, given the level range target I'd guess that there won't be
much in here that'll expand power for the top-end guilds if anything. So the
likelihood of a truly "unbalanced" situation should be low. Overall, I'm
cautiously optimistic that this will be the smoothest expansion launch to
date.
