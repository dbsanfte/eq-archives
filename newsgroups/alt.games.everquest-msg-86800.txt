Actually, it's Crushbone belts.  You give them to Canloe Nusback
in Kaladim, four at a time.  He gives you exp and some money and
some equipment in exchange.  You can turn around and sell what he
gives you.  It's well worth the trip if you have 3 or 4 backpacks
full.  Stops being worthwhile around level 10.
