I had same trouble after running testeverquest and using the dx8.dll.
in the eq ini. I did the following and switched back to dx7.dll
whatever and was fine.
I did not have all the files it mentioned anyway, I only had:

gequip3.s3d
sky.s3d

I deleted those and it patched the sky.s3d and then i got in.

"We're very sorry about the problems some folks are experiencing this
morning. We've found a fix for those that are having a problem being
kicked out after they choose "play online".
Here's a copy of the patch message.

** For those having problems logging in **

If you are having a problem that causes you to be kicked out of the
game after selecting "Play on line", there is a solution to this
problem.


Delete these files from your EverQuest directory:

bmpwad6.s3d
sky.s3d
gequip3.s3d
gequip3.wld


This should solve the problem.

However, if you find that you are still having the problem and you
have previously edited your eqclient.ini file in order to test out the
DX8 DLL, then you should be able to fix the problem by:

Edit the line in your EQClient.ini in your EQ directory from
"GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx8.DLL" to "GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx7.DLL".

We apologize for any trouble this may have caused some of our
customers.
