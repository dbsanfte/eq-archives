Ah, okay I guess I should have mentioned that I already know all the
allakhazam stuff and HAVE been raising my dark elf cleric of innoruks
protectors of the pine and jagged pine that way.. THE HARD WAY.

That is why I'm looking for sites with more info ;)

I was not detailed enough. The ways that I've been doing it are the
only ways you can:

Beg for wolf form from a druid after you get a bunch o' poacher heads.
Beg for the druid to camo you after you turn in heads but before you
hit ACCEPT (usually have to explain to silly druid "Why?" ) since it
makes you indiff (and even in wolf or halfling form I'm glower
dubious.

Beg for a wolf form or halfling form to do the delivery quest to
nestiff. The nestiff part I can then do in dark elf form since my
qeynos factions are great.  The problem is, especially if I used the
ONE USE hafling quest mask, that I then need to beg for a wolf form
again to turn in the thing from nestiff to the protectors guy (WHICH
is the only part of the quest that raises protectors. 

So, as you can see really the best way is to get about 80 poacher
heads on me before I beg a druid to wolf me, then camo me at each turn
in. I MIGHT then get non kos to protectors. The problem is that you
really need to be able to track to FIND the poachers popping when you
kill otherstuff in toxula (best poacher area) The heads from toxula
are also used in the quest. So either way, I REALLY need to slave a
druid (have two computers or someone VERY bored) to both help get the
heads and assist with turning them in. 

No faction KILL raises protectors. Jagged pine is the gnolls and I DID
get to dubious with them klling the gnolls. I just want to be able to
get a port to surefall and be non kos from the prots too. Currently
the prots are still threaten after about 5 poacher heads and 2 talym
shoontar heads (which from allakhazams posts are thought to be higher
factions.

SO, without writing all of the above I was looking for general dark
elf/evil faction boards where I could see if anyone has more info. I
guess as I said I should make one ;) The jagged pine faction raising
just takes time, as the link you posted says:

http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=121

Oh, and I and someone else posting around there have seemed
to isolate the fact, with conning and mobs killed, that the WC two
druid type people are on kithikor residents faction (so you'd kill
orcs in high hold to raise them), The nk druids are ALL on jagged
pine, as are the east k, Treants are on jagged pine (but when the
fabulous five, with Xanasus in tow(god that was scary) forced my dark
elf to divine barrier and then zone yesterday.. I think xanasus is on
Karana residents (still threaten to that but its raiseable with kills
of bandits and turning in moonstones to McNeab or whomever in the 
bar in qeynos (you get the moonstones from turning in gnoll teeth to
the captain) )

I want to find any such faction sites for more info than just
surefall.
