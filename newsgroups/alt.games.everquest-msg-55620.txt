}syndrome)

Thing is, -do- watch the fight for more than three seconds, and con the 
mob if you don't know roughly, and /whot the player.  If I could count the 
number of times people have 'helpfully' KSed mobs from me that were 30 
levels below me just because I was at 1/8th health and they didn't realize 
this was the 43rd such mob I'd fought since I last sat down to heal...

Or one time that really sticks in my mind, when a 'helpful' wizzie nuked 
to death a mob I was fighting that (a) was 20 levels below me, and (b) had 
already used its HT, thus explaining my low health...

Basically, make sure that the poor sucker you're helping is not only at 
low health, but that the health is actually -decreasing-. :)

Being a chanter without jboots, I usually lose a lot of health early in 
the fight until the dang spell actually sticks.  But then I -do- have him 
where I want him, so back the heck off. :)

}and people who ask you for help, and when you step in to
}help them, they say "What the hell are you doing? Heal me, damn it!"
}(uhhh... dude... I'm a <warrior>).

Yeah, once you ask for help... You lose all right to bitch. :)
