To the whiney Brit:
1) no-one forced you to buy this game.
2) getting pissed off at all Americans because of a single video game
manufacturer is not only childish, it's downright stupid.
3) If you're still playing with Star Trek toys you are either childish or
downright stupid.  Take your pick.
4) If you are so upset about a video game in the first place you are BOTH
childish AND stupid.

I could go on and on, but you're not even worth the effort I've already
expended.  I've always thought Verants lack of support for Europe is
abyssmal, but never bolstered a "fuck Europe" mentality.

Grow up.

Sincerely,
Sean...

Oh yeah, I don't normally add a "stupid quote", but I'll add one to this
just to make your day.

"Shut up you stupid Brit!"- Sean Lowe]

enjoy your day.
