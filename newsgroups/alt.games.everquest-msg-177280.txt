What do you consider high levels?

At levels 57 through 60 so far, I find that root lasts for full duration
more often than not.  I do a lot of root and rot soloing, so, I do believe I
have a fair amount of experience with it.  In a group situation, I often
will root a mezzed mob, that also sticks for full duration most of the time.
This give the tank(s) time to build aggro, as even with them beating on the
mob, root generally lasts for a while (not full duration for the most part),
usually long enough that they have aggro when root does break.
