In both the LDoN adventures I have done, someone always "offers" to be the
master looter (ML).  I frankly hate that system, especially when grouped
with people you don't know (non-guild).  I have always preferred to alpha
loot and roll on various augment drops, NO DROPS for certain classes,etc.

I know  - sometimes you get screwed. Such is luck. And sometimes, the
puller, if they can do the alphabet, can pull 5 suckers for the rest of the
party, then pull the named behemoth in the corner for himself....but in my
experience you always get screwed with the ML system. I'd bet my left arm
that the ML makes out better than anyone else. No one can keep track of all
the little stuff they pick up. It's a charity system - and the ML keeps his
cut plus overhead.

One guy said it was in the interest of time. I suppose, but seriously 50+
characters ought to know when their name (alpha) comes up. Hell, I usually
announce it toward end of fights for the attention deficit in the group.
(e.g. "Loot Bren, then Humm, then Julip")

Of course people cheat that system too. Three mobs died in the battle and
although they should loot the first one that fell, they take the last one
cause it looks tastier.

No good system I guess with little, dishonorable twerps in the split. LOL.

Any ideas that really work and defeat the skunks who overloot, pre-loot,
Master Loot (wow, what a favor), pull-loot, etc...
