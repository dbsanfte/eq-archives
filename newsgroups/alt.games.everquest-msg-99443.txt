For what it's worth, I took the container list that was posted on
usenet some time ago and made an Excel spreadsheet out of it, ranking
the list on a formula I made out of the weight and # of slots. I just
posted it at http://www.geocities.com/badlands.geo/everquest/containers.xls.
It may be an interesting read for monks and other classes conserned
about weight (like my enchanter). There's bound to be some errors in
it, so if you see something wrong let me know. I also haven't given
proper credit to the creator of the original list (who was that
anyway?).
