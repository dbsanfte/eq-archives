    Others have answered your other questions, just a side note on this
one - don't remove the compass window because every time you get a success
it goes super accurate for a short time, and will give you a more precise
reading than for example "northeast". You can even spin around for a second
or two after a success and the compass remains accurate.

Cheers,
James
