Had the same problem and my 2 accounts are both running fine after a machine 
reboot. I think the problem is that the patch installed a file that requires 
Windows to restart, so you need to reboot your machine. After I did that on 
both machines I was in and stable with no problems.

I heard that Antonica was down and laggy so I stayed away from there and 
focused on tradeskilling. Holy crap did they change that world. The spells 
are all different, they've been segregated across different world devices, 
and all new dependencies have developed for 20+ items. I have new recipes 
for Alchemy 20, 21 and 22 but can't make any of the potions, poisons or 20+ 
combat art essences without the participation of Jewelers to make Advanced 
Potion Vials and they need from me Hexanoid Loam to make those. Except I'm 
missing the recipe. ALL of the prices changed and so spells cost me about 
twice as much to make now. In all the confusion over the new system and the 
new pricing, not many people are actually making things. Within 10 seconds 
of my putting a dozen Runes and Spells on my merchant, they started selling 
and were sold out in a few minutes.

Patch day. Gotta love it. :)
