> As a lvl 13 Shammy, I was excited to finally get SoW.  My main is a 35
Mage and I always envied theSoW'er/Breezer's out there.  Well, I am not so
excited any more.  It's not that I mind helping, I enjoy helping. But as a
lowbie I asked people for a donation (appreciated, not expected) at the EC
tunnel last nite. 11 people came for a SoW and not 1 donated so much as 1gp.
I ALWAYS donate for breeze, etc..at least something. In fact 3 people just
ran off without so much as a "thank you".  The game balance is such that, I
believe, we SoW'ers should try and parlay a much needed buff into some small
semblance of income generation. I will always continue to help people for a
CR..but 1 guy asked me for a SoW for a CR and he was wearing 200pp worth of
armor when he asked...I have been fighting at a derv camp in NRo and had
people stand and wait for a SoW,(non-group members),..despite a lvl 13
Shammy not exactly brimming with mana to spare. On the other hand, I had a
high lvl Isky monk killing guards ask me if I wanted to loot the corpses and
I gave him a SoW in return for the favor. He gave me 24 pp. Some people do
know the economy of the game and it helped me to continue to believe that at
least some players will at least try and do the right thing.  I do not want
to hide behind "/anon "(and as a Barb with out plate, most figure out that I
may be a Shammy anyway), but I am not a SoWing machine either.  Just my
frustrated 2 cents worth...

And you're entirely right, of course. A question I have is  -- "what about
the drive-by spells'? I have a druid and a shammy, so I'm forever giving out
SoW's and whatever else people need/want/ask for... but when I'm playing my
low level enchanter, how do I respond to drive-bys? I always say thank you,
and I always say "if you should ever need my aid, please /tell me"... is
there anything else that is required or expected? I never expect more when
I'm playing druid or shammy, other than for those folks who do ask to be
literate (oh yeah, right) and to say 'thank you'.

Appreciate any comments from anyone!
