Most clerics keep a close eye on the teams damage and also on the mob
health.
The cleric would know a lot better than 90% of melee'rs whether for the
entire fight the mobs health has fallen faster than your warriors.  I
wouldn't say anything and just let him cast a CH on the warrior at the end
of the fight.  (Just hope the mob doesn't ENRAGE).  If he's a 56+ cleric,
his summoned hammer proc's like mad when using Yaulp V and does quite a bit
of damage.
