My wizard is basically my third highest character, dont really play him much
though.  His defence is 30ish (he is level 46).

Problem was my main is a ranger, so I learned how to control aggro,
therefore he rarely got hit.

People said you get some defence by quadding, well damn, I'm actually pretty
good at quadding and dont get hit...

Both quadding and grouping he does dps, crowd control, evac.  He has taunt
stick (my 36 mage has clay bracelet / pet focus).

Since the bonus to group exp > solo exping skills seem to have gone down,
people in LDoN's often freak if 2 *gasp count em* mobs come.

I dunno, I believe in playing any and all characters I have, even lowly
alts, to the best of my ability, and try to learn the class to a good level
and the nuances of each.  Alot is to do with player attitude.

Some players fight and play there way up.  Others are dragged up by the
former, IMO.
