That's the main reason I'm not in a guild. I've been involved with 6 guild
creations in some way.  From saying I might consider joining to actually
going to chat (or to the group awaiting the GM to come onto the server to
make the guild).  One guy I didn't take seriously, I just told him to get
everyone else first.  He called it "the coolest guild in Norath" and said it
would be for powerleveling and making money charging for ports.  He was a
Druid (nothing against the good druids).  A week later he still didn't have
his guild.  It then disbanded about a week after it was made.  I have NEVER
witnessed a successful creation of a guild, even from people who appeared to
know what they were doing.
