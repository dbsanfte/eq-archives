You're not considering warrior because druid cant keep his hitpoints up? 
Well how could the druid keep the enchanters/clerics/bards hitpoints up or 
vice versa? :P. Mage is another thing, they can solo - I don't think a 
druid could complement that character much.

Necro + druid make nice snare+fear kiting group...

>Shadow Knight - same concerns as Necro.

fear+snare + SK beating up the mob...it's nice :). 

If you plan to play in that 2 man group for most of the time, you have to 
fight single mobs most of the time, and a druid can easily keep 
warrior/sk/pally/whoever healed in that kind of situation up to 50th level 
I'd say. In a 2 man group, no one can keep the main tank healed if there is 
multiple mobs, since the mobs will aggro the healer pretty quickly.

Someone needs to take the hits (unless you plan to do only kiting, then you 
should take a wizard with you), so you need a tank or a pet. If a pet, I'd 
say that necro + druid is better than mage + druid. Necro can take 
advantage of the druid regen and heal spells to keep up his manapool...
