It depends...what happens in dungeons where not many gems fall?  If
the cleric uses 18 gems that cost 11p each, and gets 0 from drops,
does everyone chip in and pay for the 18 gems?  If the cleric is
expected to eat the cost when drops are scarce, then it is not
unreasonable to let the cleric reap the rewards when drops are
plentiful.
