Everything is situational, no need to go overboard on the absolutes. 
While Cleric melee is just for yuks and I in no way care what the cap is
on weapon skills for them, to say that I can't whack a mob with my stick
for cheap laughs is silly.  

Case in point, my group managed to talk our enchanter friend to hide
from his wife and join us for a rare evenings fun over the weekend.  We
started a fight in Acrylia around 7pm that was still going on 2.5 hours
later.  Note I said "a fight".  This was one constant fight with a
steady stream of adds and respawns mesed and waiting.  We had a room
with about a dozen spawns, most all carrying mana for our enchanter to
suck from their brains and continue his special brand of fun.  Once we
got rolling, about 20 minutes into the fun, I not only could melee with
my cleric, I was freaking nuking!  We only stopped when it was time for
east coasters to go to bed, otherwise we fought constantly for 2.5 hours
and not one group member suggested that I wouldn't be welcome next time
because I was meleeing.

Do Clerics need higher weapons skills?  Of course not, but that doesn't
mean we should be banished for using a club when the time is right.
