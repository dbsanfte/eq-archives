I know you probably already know this - but the trial is long
enought to take 2 hits off a T-rod.  I can take one after my
first few nukes, and it recycles before/during the 4th wave.

If you're not already looking around for rods before the trial,
it seems like a good plan - an extra 720 mana each for the druid,
enchanter and cleric might turn the tide in your favor.
