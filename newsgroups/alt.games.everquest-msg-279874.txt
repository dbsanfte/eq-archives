I'd say the MA = MT often enough that they are virtually 
interchangeable.

In my experience pretty much the only time the MA is not the MT in 1 
group content is when the MT is also responsible for picking up the 
unmezzable adds because there are no suitable OT candidates. 

Then you designate a dps class as MA. Then on pulls the MT goes around 
gaining taunt on *everything* unmezzable that comes in while the MA 
picks a target and sticks with it. Everyone else can rely on the MA 
having the right target, while the MT might be rotating targets to keep 
taunt.

e.g. a group with a paladin, wizard, enchanter, rogue, druid might 
designate the rogue MA, and the pali MT, if -and- only if there were 
unmezzables that were adding.
