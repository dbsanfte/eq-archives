Technically you're right about what they *said,* but the meaning is
still there.   Here's how the quest went at the relevant part before
the change:

Naggy dies;
Zordak spawns (some hours later);
cleric turns in pearl;
Zordak attacks cleric;
raid kills Zordak;
Zordakalicus Ragefire (dragon) spawns;
raid kills dragon, etc etc etc.

Now note the change (quoting):

"The cleric still turns in his Shimmering Pearl to Zordak. But now
the merchant Zordak will return a Swirling Pearl to the Cleric and
disappear."

Now how does that possibly lead to a triggered spawn?  You have
to *KILL* Zordak to spawn the dragon.  You can't kill him when he
disappears.   That leaves the only thing to do:  go look for his
random spawn.

I can see the assumption that "head out and look for him" means
he spawned.  I can't see that meaning anything except that you
are now at the next part of the quest, though:  you find Zordak in
killable form and kill him.

Well, assuming there is no triggered spawn, there's two
changes to the quest:

You now have to camp the merchant for the turn-in.  This
is a one-per-day occurance.   Maybe there's not that many
clerics at that point to make it a point of contention, but
I'd assume there is.  Certainly everyone waiting on Zordak
today has theirs and has to go through the turn-in.  There
are servers with six month (or longer) waiting lists.  Now all
those clerics can contend for the right to turn in their pearl.
Even assuming a one-per-week Zordak, that's still 24 or so
(three weeks or more) of turn-ins.   That's going to be a spot
for contention for weeks on most servers.

You have to kill the random (every few days) Zordak.   That's
not new and the *only* change has been the removal of the
requirement to kill Naggy.  Zordak could -- and did -- spawn
multiple times after Naggy was killed before he respawned.
So the only "reduction" has been the time taken to get a raid
to kill Naggy.   I've never known Naggy to live out the day, so
you're cutting a few hours off the spawn time.

So no real reduction in spawn time for Zordak and a new camp
for the pearl turn-in means more time spent.   Even if a cleric
just has to go to SolB and turn it in (and do we really think they're
going to put that merchant at zone so you don't have to fight
your way in?) it's going to take essentially the same time.

True, *if* he only drops the Heart.  I don't expect that to be
true but would be very happy if it is.

Here's the real "fun" part.   The turn-in version spawns somewhere in
SolB, the cleric swaps his pearl, and then -- quoting here -- will "head
out" to look for the killable version.   There's no way they're going to
spawn Zordak in the room with a live Naggy.  And there's no way IMO
that they'll spawn him elsewhere in SolB.  (Can you imagine an XP
group getting pushed out of camp for a raid?   It's bad enough with
the raid killing everything in its path on the way back there...)

So the cleric "heads out."   I think some corner of Lavastorm (or
Timerous Deep or OOT more likely) is going to be real lively before
long.  If they really want to reduce the problems, they'll do this in
a zone where you can't port in quickly.
