That's attitude...yours.  If it feels like a job then it's time to see what
else is available besides hack & slash.  There's lots.

Best bet, of course, would be to quit playing all online games and go out &
have a real life.  The reason I started playing was 'cause I had no life
already so I wasn't losing anything, but I'm in a minority (I hope).

Who here scorns casual players?  I haven't noticed anyone...name some names,
please.
As to Verant, I'm sure they LOVE casual gamers but, quite frankly, Everquest
isn't a casual game, sorry, unless you find some casual player friends who
play casually the same time you do.

As to the changes, most of them are wonderful.  I think that any change that
gets you to the high end faster is HORRIBLE though...it's saying "we know
everyone hates the low levels so let's get them up to the top ASAP!!!"
Bullshit, that kind of thinking is Monty Haul-ish.

I love the vast majority of changes though.
