WTF?  You know.  If you are an American (I dont wish to perform traces, etc)
let alone a human at all, you would atleast understand just what kind of
effect these recent terrorist bombings have on the US.

People like yourself just disgust me.  If you are American, I believe we
should ship your ass to be with those responsilble before we nuke the hell
out of you all.  Though, I believe I like bizbee's idea.  Napalm.  Its nasty
stuff, but, somehow it isnt nasty enough.
