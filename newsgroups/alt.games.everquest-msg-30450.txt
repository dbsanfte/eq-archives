I play on EMarr and Sullon Zek (and I occasionally visit Saryn, Vazelle, and
Tallon Zek.)

There are times I get bored playing Blue servers.  I enjoy the thrill and
the extra danger of the PvP's.  I enjoy the challenge of playing a good guy
in a land where people think you have to act like an ass to survive.

I enjoy doing what are considered suicidal things, like solo adventuring a
cleric in enemy territory, and escaping every attempt on my life.  I enjoy
grouping together with fellow team mates to repell an attack on our
'homeland.'  The trade skills seem more important on the PvP servers.  There
is a comeradere and extra depth of roll-playing that comes with the Team
PvP's that seems to be a bit lacking on the Blue servers.  It puts a whole
new twist on EQ.

But then there are times I get bored of the PvP servers, too.  I personally
don't like to squish other players just because I can (I'll go play Quake or
Unreal Tournament if I want that).  Sometimes I _don't_ want the extra
tension, paranoia, and stress that comes with PvP.  I tire of the childish
attitudes of hardcore PK'ers who cannot stomach the presence of RP'ers in an
RP'ing game.  Then I return to my bluebee servers.... for a while.

Both PvP and Bluebee servers give me a welcome relief from the other.  I
play both.  I would recommend that everyone give one of the PvP's a try, but
I don't think long term play on them is for everyone.

Verant is giving their customers what they want, when it comes to the number
of PvP servers vs. the number of Blue servers.

There are some flaws in the way EQ works on the PvP servers, too.  Verant
has stated that EQ wasn't designed with PvP in mind, so some things on the
PvP servers don't work out very well.

One thing I think Verant was expecting PvP-wise that *didn't* happen, was
entire guilds of 'Red' players battling each other on the Blue servers
(which to me sounds like a fun idea.)  The fact that you don't have Red
guilds dedicated to PvP on Blue servers, seems to incidate that most gamers
don't particularly care to have PK'ing as a regular part of their EQ
experience.

As it is, the PoD's main functions are gladiatorial entertainment, and for
lowbies to suicide themselves so they can respawn their food supply.
