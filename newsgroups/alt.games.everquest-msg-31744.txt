You can avoid a lot of problems by not making that assumption.  You see
what you see, others may not, including the entire post you are
responding to.  Usenet is a bit different from web boards, we are not
all accessing the same server.  A post you see and respond to on your
server may not appear on another reader's server till long after your
post appears, if ever.  If you've been reading here more than a day or
two you've probably seen a pattern forming, the majority of vocal
readers here prefer that you 1- quote judiciously, meaning snipping when
possible, but quoting enough to give your remarks context. 2- bottom
post, meaning add your remarks after the quoted material unless you are
inserting a series of remarks within the quoted text.  

It really doesn't have to be a point of contention if you can try to
work within the existing environment, which leaves more time to address
real points of contention like whether Half Elf druids get all the
ladies because of their suave good looks or if its because of their
natural animal magetism <G>.
