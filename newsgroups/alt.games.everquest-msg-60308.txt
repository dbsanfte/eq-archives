Fine. I'll pretend that you really want to know.

I ordinarily do not have a problem with polls. In fact
i would have answered this one IF there was a real way to opt out of it.

When I click on "Skip poll", I want Verant to believe me. Instead, I get a
poll screen at log in and at log out, as if I would this would make me
answer out of sheer frustration.

I get tired of giving out information on myself on the Internet, allowing
companies to build a consumer profile for their own purposes. Sorry if that
doesn't bother you.

If I get do tired of the poll, they won't get a 'I don't know'. They'll get
deliberately incorrect information.
