Aye..... the darkest day ever has come. Dan posted an attachment to a
non-binaries group. And now, sadly, we shall have to tie him to a
convenient post with tons of kerosene soaked timber at it's base and
light him 'afire.  Ah, Danny, we shall miss yer keen wit and helpful
insight into PC problems, and knowledge of the game. But......... rules
