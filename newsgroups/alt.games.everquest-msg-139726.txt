    I'd be surprised if he had gear that was much better than yours. You
have exceptional stuff for your level - you've clearly put a lot of thought
into what to get. You even have Mana Preservation and Improved Healing II
focus items - outstanding!

    Hmm, wait. I just found the actual listing for your gear (your Magelo
link went to your dream profile). Ok, time to get to work!

    He's a jerk, plain and simple. I'd love to inspect him right back and
point out how much of his junk does him no good at his level, because most
people that twink clerics do a piss-poor job of it.

    Your WIS isn't so bad at your level, really. Going from 181 to 200 WIS
is going to get you 100 MANA, where now you have 1600 MANA. Can you see that
being the difference? I think situation (no slowers/crowd control/mana
regeneration, tanks with weak gear, lots of overpulls/no med time) and/or
technique (overhealing, using less efficient heals) are more likely your
problem, not gear.

    Stick with the CGS full-time. The mana difference is too small to make
it worth the hassle.

    In your dream profile? Yes, it's worth getting a Paw; no, doing that
quest is a pain that no cleric should go through. Paws can be found in The
Bazaar these days for as low as 1000 pp - that's the route I'd take were I
you. Assuming that you have a budget, per item, of under 2 K, these are the
changes I'd make to your dream profile:

(1) Don't do the Aegis of Life quest. You'd be better off spending that time
levelling. Your current cloak is fine.
(2) Replace one of the rings with a Shadel Bandit Ring. I've seen them dip
as low as 1000 pp when a small price war happens - if you see one at that
price, it's worth buying.
(3) Replace the face in the dream profile with either a Crystalline Spider
Eye or an Enshrouded Veil. I've seen both dip just below 1000 pp - again, at
1000 pp it's a good buy. Go with the Eye for mana pool, or if you're
concerned about future resists go for the Veil.
(4) As I said above, replace the Tome with the Paw if you see one for sale.
(5) Only if you have enough cash to afford to buy for the future: Ceremonial
Smudging Stick is a ranged slot item, AC 3 WIS 3 MANA 30 FR/PR/MR 10. I've
seen them down below 1500 pp, and even once as low as 1000 pp. It's an
exceptional item for resists, and it doesn't sacrifice any mana pool over
the alternatives. If you had the cash to spare, that's what I'd put in the
ranged slot. But it's lower priority than the changes above.

> 2. Any ideas on the arms or legs?

    The ones in your profile are excellent. What are the stats on the
Twilight Seas legs? Those might be easier on the pocketbook than raising
smithing to the point that you can make the legs. Check the Bazaar on your
server - there's usually several TS quest items for sale, all 50 pp or so.
That means you can pick up a TS item, over time, for 150 to 200 pp - very
good value for a lot of the pieces. In two weeks of watching and buying,
I've completed four quests (MAG choker and sleeves, ENC sleeves, NEC
sandals).

    The BP of the Holy Rite is soooo much better than Froglok or Seb Scale.
If you can, do it.

    You've seen my ranged idea - not a high priority, though. The Seal is
actually very good at that level. As for the Shawl, well, it's a weak item
but the upgrades in that slot are usually expensive. You might just want to
buy some Adamantine Epaulets (AC 9 WIS 7) until your shawl gets a bit
better - Ad Eps are usually 400 pp or less, so well worth the price.

    Depends on the upgrade price. Look at what that cash could get you
elsewhere to give you an idea of whether it's worth it NOW or not.
Long-term, yes, worth it because those items all resell well at close to
what you pay for them.

    You already have the Book? Lord, move it in now! It gives you more mana
than either the Testament or the Shield, and Improved Healing II at your
level is a big thing (you still use heals other than CH and your heal over
time a lot, don't you?).

    This, I don't know the answer to. I always assumed it wouldn't, though.
Also note that if you're below level 51, then you only get a fraction of the
stats listed. The amount you get is your level, divided by 51, times the
amount on the earring. So, for example, instead of 55 HPs you'd get at your
current level (43/51)x55=46 HPs.
