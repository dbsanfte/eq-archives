   Well, I meant everything but that.

   Seriously though, I got a request to make the line length a bit less
than 80, since on some newsreaders this causes weird wrapping issues,
especially if someone responds to something.  So I set my out going line
wrap length at 72.  This clearly resulted in something that is pretty
unacceptable as well.

   I've reset my line length to 75 now, and am going to take this whole
thing to alt.test.yer.posts and try to fix the thing.  I will repost the
faq here when I do.
