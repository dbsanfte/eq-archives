Morning  sunshine!

I would like to point out that any statements regarding your inability
to comprehend what others post can not be considered a personal attack
so long as the facts support the statement.  Oh surely you can claim
such, but no reasonable person could possibly support such a claim once
they reviewed the thread.  I further sumbit to you that your posts,
filled with twisted connotations as to what others are saying is in fact
the real attack taking place here.  Per your rules of engagement your
concession will be accepted at such time as you find the balls to post
it.
