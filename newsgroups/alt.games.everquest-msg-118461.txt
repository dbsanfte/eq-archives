I have to agree there. PETA are a bit of an embarrassment, and counter-
productive to boot. They have probably hurt the cause of animal rights more 
than they have helped.

Oh, come on. People hunt for amusement, and that's it. Whether they eat 
what they kill is entirely irrelevant, if they don't eat it, the badgers, 
foxes, and eventually the ants will, it's not like it's going to waste. At 
least, in less politically correct times, hunters didn't feel the need to 
try to convince people that they were one with nature and all that 
hypocritical bullshit. They hunted because they bloody well felt like it.

Well, I've been a vegetarian for "humanitarian reasons" for the last 
thirteen years. I've tried going fully vegan several times, but I've never 
had the willpower to give up on eggs and milk altogether.

> "I don't eat my friends!" is what someone told me.

Not the best way to put it, certainly. "I don't eat my kin" is more like 
it, and it's basically the same reason why people don't eat other people. 
Vegetarians simply have a wider view of what's "kin".

Nice. Is that your reaction whenever you don't understand someone?

Sometimes I wonder the same thing, but as far as hypotheticals go, I'm not 
losing a whole lot of sleep over it.
