the computer should have atlest a 1x if not a 2x AGP slot right, you
could use an geforce 4 card, but it would be overkill, especially
since its a Celeron. I got a 440MX just temporarily until I get an FX
5900 Ultra.  I had a Geforce 2 GTS Delux 32Mb Asus card.  I heard the
MX was a souped up Geforce 2, so I decided it would be a good temp
card.  Im gonna build a cheap system from pricewatch just to do some
little tasks like play dance dance revolution and run seti at home or
folding at home like programs.  

K7V266A, Socket A, 6PCI, 4x AGP, 3 DDR, 6 usb, ONBOARD SOUND with cpu
- AMD Athlon 1.3GHz 266MHz with heatsink and fan, ATX, UDMA 100, VIA
KT266A, complete combo 
Price: $94
or
SYNTAX SV266A Socket A ,200/266 Front side FSB, DDR, ATX. with cpu -
ATHLON XP 2000+,1.67GHZ 266MHz, With Heatsink & Fan, Complete Combo
Kit. 
Price: $91

Black/Grey Front Dual USB 2.0 & Audio Combo, 11bay Mid-Tower Case ATX
W/500W Powersupply 11bay W/ Spider Web Window Kit, Front Panel USB 2.0
Mid Tower Case W/500 Watt P4 & AMD Recommended Powersupply 
Price: $30

Not exactly a great system, but for a a cheap one its pretty good.
