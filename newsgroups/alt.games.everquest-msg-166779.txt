Actually, that was insane natural resources plus calvinist work ethics. 
Capitalism had something to do with it, but not that much. Hell, Lenin's 
"Electricity plus Soviets" doctrine took the USSR from a medieval 
country to putting a man in space in around 30 years, so basically that 
shows you how any system will work if you have an assload of natural 
wealth and a big workforce.

Take my word for it... If the USA were the size of Luxemburg and had 
around two million inhabitants, it wouldn't be the largest economy in 
the world, no matter how much capitalism you throw at it.
