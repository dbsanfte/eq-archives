I don't think you need to shop for a guild for that quest- just find 
someone to group with. And NPCs don't work- the PCs do. It's to make you 
interact with other people (IMO to get you hooked on the MMORPG aspects 
of it).

I haven't actually played the game- former guildies of mine played the 
beta and kept going on about it. Disney had a very open beta.
