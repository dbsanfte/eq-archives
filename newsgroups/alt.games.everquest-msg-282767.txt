If you are trying to PL yourself, you need to let your Berserker get
hit a lot at the lower levels so defense will go up.   You can't wait
until later when you are level 50, 60, or 70 to start working on
Defense skill because the mobs will beat your ass.

There is a right way to PL and a wrong way.
