Reflecting on last night's adventures in ToFS, I realize that I might
once again be in danger of being accused of a "sploit", so I'm in a bit
of a quandry. (And for those of you who say that every situation is
obvious as to whether or not your exploiting, *please* show me your
rationale for this one.)
  After scoping out the first floor while invis vs. Undead, we
determined that the entryway was the only good, flat, relatively "safe"
spot to pull to. The shades and shadowbeasts either didn't run at the
end of the fight, or ran so slowly that they were dead before they made
it five steps. However, the first single shadowbones we fought did a
*weird* pathing thing.  If they were the last beast standing, when they
got down to low health, they would turn and run a little ways out
towards the main room with the slippery floor, but then they would turn
around and run back through the entry hall right up to the entrance/exit
mirror. Upon reaching the mirror, unable to go further, they would just
stand there facing the wall while I inflicted the last few whacks to put
them away.
  So, make the call for me. Is that an exploit? I've already, in
essence, won the fight and I'm not going to stop hitting him for the
last few required shots just because he's stuck against a portal he
can't pass through.
  Now, intuitively I can see the *potential* for an exploit here. If the
cleric just immediately feared all the undead so they would run to that
corner, and I beat them to death with no damage to myself, then it would
be an exploit. But we didn't do that.
  And how about if I used it for mana-cheap crowd control. Spook the
Dead on the adds and let them go stand patiently in that corner while I
kill the first one. Then, when the spell wears off, they come back down
and I fight them in the same room where we started. Sploit? Or no?
