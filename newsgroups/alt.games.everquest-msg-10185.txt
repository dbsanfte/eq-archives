Congratulations :)

A friend of mine in the SCA wins awards for her medieval brewing. When
I last visited her, she had quite a few bottles of herbed strong stuff
around the house... and I also believe she does mead. 
(I was depressed at the time and was informed that a sip of one of
those bottles could have had quite an effect, if I'd felt like turning
to alcohol :) (I don't drink) )
