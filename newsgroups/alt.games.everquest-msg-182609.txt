The physiological traits involved may be natural, but lumping them 
together and calling them "race" is certainly artificial. After all, we 
don't choose blood type to divide people into races, for example, and 
it's a difference every bit as important as skin color is.

As an artist, I can tell you that those differences are meaningless, and 
don't deserve to have people categorized into groups in account of them. 
Anyway, they are on the way out, all our bloodlines become increasingly 
mixed. And about time too.

Hm... are "redneck", "chinless wonder" or "dumb blonde" races too? Those 
epithets also give me a rough idea of how someone will generally look, 
and yet we don't call them races.

?!

Well, since it's neither natural nor divine, what would you call it, 
other than artificial?
