I think he wants to raise the steel warrior faction by
turning the fangs in in Halas.  The only other way to raise
steel warrior faction I can think of is turning in Deathfist
belts to an NPC in the Freeport Warrior guild (Conium
Darkblade i think is the name, can't remember for certain). 
You will want this faction up as a warrior if you ever plan
on doing the Hero Bracer quest.  You can also gain faction
with both corrupt and non corrupt guards by killing bandits
in the Karanas.  Turning in the sashes you get is also a
great money maker and raises faction with the good parts of
Qeynos (can't remember if you take a hit with the evil or
not when turning in sashes).
