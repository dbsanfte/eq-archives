The public, especially the republicans never forgave him for breaking his
promise not to raise taxes.  I don't agree with most of Bush seniors
policies, but I will admitt that he was an honorable man.  That's why it was
a slap in the face when he broke his word.  OTOH, from Clinton, it was
expected.

That's the difference between running on character, and running on
personality.  The former is more demanding.
