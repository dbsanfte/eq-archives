Not that I'm aware of, but if you go to http://www.eqatlas.com/ and look
at the expanded map page for the zone you are interested in, you may
find some help.  Usually the vendors shown on the map have a general
notation as to what, of interest, you may find with the vendor. (e.g.
which ones sell food, armor, smithing supplies, pottery, etc.)
