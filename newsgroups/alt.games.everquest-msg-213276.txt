Hey, I can summon you the full round of mage gear while you are low level,
getting less useful as you level up past the limits of the focus effects on them
of course, but maybe I'll be able to keep up with you.  Can also provide
summoned Chainmail to gear you with.  Fun trick is to be sure and leave the
stuff on a body when you log out, no exp loss at all at sub 11 levels and not
much really after that for a while

As for the monkling, 17 isn't far from 20 which is what you'd need to group with
my mage at the moment, should be able to PL you up pretty quick with a 13 point
DS, give me a tell if you like.

Splendid One, 30 mage, Firiona Vie
