Quick, someone fetch a child of twelve to explain it.   (Oh, nevermind, we
appear to have one right here.)

Unfair to who?  How does my having a good weapon change your game at all?
Unless I give you the weapon (which by your way of thinking is absolutely
fine) there is absolutely no difference to your gameplay.

And that difference is.....?

In other words, I'm still waiting for you to explain how exactly is it
"better" to have the twink item come from a friend, rather than giving it to
yourself.

Other than that, as Mark so expertly put it... What... the... FUCK?!?   Rules
raping?  Who's rules, yours?  Who the fuck are you, and why should I follow
your rules?  And implying that getting personal gratification out of a GAME
and RECREATIONAL PURSUIT is somehow wrong....    Well shit, I though that was
the whole point of playing, to have fun.
