Yes, I've run into my share of those types...


One that really bugs the heck out of me is /tells like this:

<total stranger> tells you, 'Come here.'

That comes close to sending me through the ceiling every time...


What's really bad is that if you /reply with "Why?", they usually get all

they're doing and come running like a puppy dog when master whistles...
