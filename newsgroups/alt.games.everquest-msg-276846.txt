I wonder if the game in question had a EULA saying that item sales were
forbidden? In which case the murderer should get his account banned as well.
:*)


In Australia, you aren't allowed to kill people in defense of property,
maybe you can in China, but the object in question existed as information,
and people have been killing over that everywhere since before history
began. I think we are going to see a lot more of these things going on, and
the law is going to have to step in and either rule that trying to sell such
items for money is a scam (because the item doesn't really exist), in which
case the police should have helped him recover it, or that the item was
stolen and it was real, in which case the old laws would still apply.

As for the item being virtual, well, so is money. It only exists as data, is
moved around as data and so forth. The days we bartered real items instead
are long gone.
