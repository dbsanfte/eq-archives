At the very high levels, while not being stunned is nice, HP and AC is
more important, since the role of the main tank is to hold aggro and
soak up damage.  Other melee classes can do a better job dealing
damage.

Heck, Legacy of Steel is currently using a *Wood Elf* as their main
tank.  She's got so much +HP equipment that she's got way more HP than
the trolls and ogres.  (Hell, with the equipment they have, their
Rogues probably tank better than non-uberguild Warriors...the
equipment situation in EQ has gotten totally out of hand).

Only Dark Elf Clerics get snare.  (Clinging Darkness is the effect on
an deity-specific item that only Innoruuk Clerics get).
