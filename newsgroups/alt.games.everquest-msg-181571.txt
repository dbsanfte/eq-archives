Yeah, if you can afford it, getting a new mobo, RAM and video
card is the best way to go, but not the cheapest.

I was just looking at this week's WorstBuy ad and saw this
for you:

They have a PNY Verto GeForce4 MX420 PCI video card for $59.99
after rebates.  Note that this is the PCI, not the AGP.  Again,
it is preferrable to use AGP, but even a PCI GF4MX is probably
tons better than your on-board video (especially since it sounds
like you've got a really cheap mobo).

As for only having 2 slots for RAM:  Again, assuming that your
board uses PC133/PC100 and not DDR, here is a reasonable solution.
Yank the 2 sticks you have now.  WorstBuy has 256Mb PC133 RAM for
$17.99 after rebates.  Buy two of those to total 512Mb for ~$35.

So, for around $100 after rebates (yeah, I hate the rebates but
you have to play the game if you want to save money) you can
upgrade both the video and RAM to reasonable levels to get you
along for a while without buying (essentially) a whole new machine.
