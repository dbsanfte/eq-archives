I used to believe as you do.  Now I would say that you appear to be
making the mistake of projecting modern attitudes and sensibilities
onto people who lived in a far different world than we do.
Some years ago I read a translation of the Pentateuch (sp?) into English
by an orthodox Jewish scholar, including his commentary, and spent a
fair bit of time considering how what he had to say conflicted with the
beliefs I had held up to that time, in the context of the differences
between the world I live in and the world the authors of what we
Christians call the Old Testament lived in.  These were not people who
conducted scientific experiments, they were not even aware of the (as
yet uninvented) scientific method.  Their practices were arrived at
empiricly (it worked for my father, and his father before him, and...)
and innovation was frowned upon.  Rapid, substantial changes to any
aspect of their way of life occurred only in response to great stress.
Some change occured over multiple generations, as minor innovations were
seen not to result in disaster for their practitioners, but things were
incredibly static compared to modern life.  These are not people who
said: "Many of us are ill, we must search scientificly for the cause..."
"Eureka!  Eating pigs can make you sick!".  Rather, they are people who
said: "Eating pigs is against God's law", and then when they noticed
that their pig-eating neighbors were afflicted more with disease than
they were: "God is punishing them for their disobedience".  Note the
difference: afflictions are seen to come from the hand of God as
punishment for wrongdoing (a popular superstition still among far too
many folk, even in educated societies), the pig is considered only in
the context of the wrongdoing, not the affliction (punishment).
