Sorry about the rudeness of my first response. Aside from hoping for Mythic
to get rid of alt-tab restrictions (I personally don't see it happening, but
you never know) or for AOL UK to not use the pop-up thing, I think the only
way to get around it without running up a huge phone bill would be to use
some other means of connection - Are there any non-phone Internet service
provider options available in your area? It  might be less expensive than
the phone bill, and would have the added benefit of higher speeds. (we have
cable modems and DSL options here in the states, you probably have a
different thing going in the UK)
