    Forms of these two things are already in game. I wish that older quests
were revamped like this, but I don't see it happening.

    In PoP, you get character flags for completing certain events. There's
an NPC in Plane of Knowledge which, if you sit in front of her and say "What
guided meditation", you get a list of all the current character flags you
have. As you complete quests, older flags are dropped so you always know
what your current goals are.

    Some quest NPCs that have long speeches in PoP actually have [continue]
as the bracketed text. You read the long paragraph, say "continue", and get
the next paragraph. So no guessing what phrasing allows you to continue.
And, for all you Canadians out there like me, no standing by the PoK Hate
armour return NPC for clerics saying "What armour" for five minutes and
wondering why he won't respond. Damned American gnomes.
