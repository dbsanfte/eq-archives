I think they abandonded the whole 'DAoC types' and just 'upgraded' the
existing ones... I noticed a new directory called SpellEffects containing
.TGA files off images similar to the old effects

Looks to me like they just changed the engine and kept the spell effects.

It's a pity they will cannot (or perhaps will not)allow cutomized spell
effects like they do with the UI. There are some incredible UIs out there
and would love to see what players could come up with.....
