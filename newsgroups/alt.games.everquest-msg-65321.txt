OK, The most basic Path is 98>ME>XP  By my count that's 3 generations.

Don't be pedantic and try to count 98se as distinct from 98.  Otherwise
we'll have to count all 5 service releases for 95.

Windows history lesson

Windows 3.0 First major commercial release

windows 3.1 Patch to make 3.0 stable

Windows 3.11/workgroups  First jab at Network capability

NT 3.51  MS and IBM squable, MS takes their half of OS/2 and markets it
to businesses.

NT4 and 95 were concurrent Versions

98/98se although I'm willing to count 98 as a "generation" weren't a
significant upgrade

ME and nt5/2k  were concurrent releases.  Oh, and ME was a major
downgrade, both in reliability and user friendliness.

XP is the "merging" of the home and corporate lines.
