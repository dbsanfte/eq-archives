Just hit level 46 with my druid, and in all that time I have never
picked a single item that I could use. Where do I have to go to get
stuff that's appropriate for my level ? 

I camped Chief Goonda for a while and all I got was a turtleshell helm
(improved healing I). 

It just seems a big letdown that after all this time and being level
46 still nothing even remotely decent drops from anything. I don't
know where all the magic stuff in the game comes from as I almost
never see a magic item drop, let alone a usable one. All I do is get
plat and go buy stuff from the bazaar.
