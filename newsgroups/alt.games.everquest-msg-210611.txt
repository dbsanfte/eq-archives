From the shadows, the mysterious "Shuacat" <katlienc@nospamyahoo.com>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>I was in a fast pulling group in PoI this evening.  Things were going well
>until 9:14 pm ET.  For some reason I was unable to cast.  The MA (a 57
>Pally) had just pulled an obsolete model and I couldn't cast a heal.  It
>didn't fizzle, spells just wouldn't cast.  Based on the shouts and OOC's
>every caster in the zone was unable to cast.

>We made haste to the zone to lose the aggro.  Zoning corrected the problem.
