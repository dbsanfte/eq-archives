You'll leave Shadeweavers at 13 (you don't have to but the backside is
pretty rough). You can get to 22 or even higher in Paludal. Start with
Plergs and then move to Patogs.

With the new exp bonus Paludal should be insane exp. But you
*absolutely* have to have cure disease available in some way, the
Phlerg dot lasts longer than some characters.

Don't bother curing it while you're fighting there, the tanks will
just get it again next fight anyways. Just worry about getting it
cured when you leave or log.
