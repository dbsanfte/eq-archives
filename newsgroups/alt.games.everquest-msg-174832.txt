Got any interesting ideas for the temple of the mount scene where he appears
in the Jewish Temple and declares himself God? I would like to see him come
out of the floor with African drummers drumming a sinister yet triumphant
sounding beat and Jewish rabbis wailing away at the great abomination they
are about to see and three shots from helicopters from different angles with
it shown on every channel with a news organization talking about how the
"great man" was about to declare himself as God as though it had already
been planned out as some kind of a live circus sports show.

Then when he declares himself as God, he should grow small horns in his head
and growl and breathe fire and shake his fist at the sky and a lightning
storm should erupt in the city.
