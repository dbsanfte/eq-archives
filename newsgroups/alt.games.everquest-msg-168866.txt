------------------------------


** Spells **

- Fixed a number of inconsistencies with Bard song messages.  Thanks to the
players that submitted the comprehensive list of oddities.
- Mind Wrack should no longer overwrite Force Shield or the Wizard Epic
effect.
- Splurt should now stack better with most Damage over Time spells.
- Infectious Cloud should no longer overwrite Demi-Lich.
- Despair should no longer overwrite Yaulp V.
- Several spell particle effects should appear correctly on the target now.
- Several Bard songs have had their animations corrected.
- Grim Aura should no longer overwrite the Spiritual Brawn series.
- Riftwind's Protection should no longer overwrite the Augmentation series.
- Added new particle effects to the Gnomish Firework spells.
- The Psalm series of bard songs should no longer be overwritten by
Elemental Chorus or Purifying Chorus.  Additionally, Psalm of Veeshan should
overwrite all other lower level Psalms.
- Searing Flames' fire debuff has been reduced in power, but it should stack
with most other debuffs now.
- The Malo line should no longer overwrite the druid circle series of
spells.


** Items **

- Shield of the Immaculate now has a 1 second casting time.
- Anizok's Gauze Press should now summon 20 bandages regardless of your
level.


** Miscellaneous **

- Aten Ha Ra now draws strength from her allies.  It may be unwise to
attempt to defeat her without first killing them.
- Removed most of the negative stat effects from the Shaman made potions.
This should make them more useful and allow them to stack better with other
magic.
- Added a few more keys to the player key ring for convenience.
- Water needed to make a Box of Souls no longer needs to be either Sacred or
Holy.
