(SACAIGAP)

Gave up on the shaman, eh?

In any event, a monk only two handed blunt was linked down to us mortals the
other day.

Monk only, 30 damage, 22 delay, ton and a half of stats including 10 sta 125
hp or better.   With weapons like that coming out of PoP for monks, I don't
think they have to worry about having lost all of thier edge in damage
production, just because they didn't have "thier own windblade" added.

Hell, the monk fists at level 65 are 15 damage 20 delay, even with no
weapons.   Thats a  hell of a lot better ratio than anything I'm wearing (or
likely to be at 65.)  and not only is it not "no drop"... you don't even
have to purchase it off another player.
