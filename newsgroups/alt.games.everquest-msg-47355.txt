As they point out at Casters Realm, though, for a Human Monk, you
probably should not be agnostic.  The places that would have a problem
with a follower of Quellious (sp?) will also be likely to have
problems with Humans, so you don't really hurt yourself by going with
Quellious, and you gain the ability to use Quellious-only items, if
Verant ever introduces any.
