Grummus. He has two aoes and one targetted proc. One AoE can be cured easily
by RC1. It is advisable you have at least one priest with RC1 in each group
to heal that AoE. The other AoE can be cured as well but it can also be
easily countered by MGB heal over time spell which is a better idea. He also
procs a slow on the MT so you need a few people chain casting disease cure
on him or the MT will lose aggro. Melee damage: prepare for 1100max and
quad. Worst thing are the adds. You have to clear adds and engage quickly.
After he drops you have to cure everyone and adds should start respawning,
and theres a lot of adds.

Terris Thule. Clearing to her the mobs are unmezzable and unslowable and
will usually come two at a time. TT herself: melee hits for 600quad and
procs a lifetap on the MT. Its magic based -200. She is slowable. At 75% she
spawns a bunch of butterflys around her legs which you gotta kill somehow.
At 50% she will AoE dispell so you need to save enough MGB's to rebuff raid
or have some sort of DA system to avoid it. And at 30% four gargoyle guards
located on pillars around her room will awake, start to move down the
pillar, then become targetable. Kite or offtank, gargoyles can all be
slowed. Thats it.

I couldnt tell you about numbers it al relys on teamwork/skill and of course
AA/equipment.
