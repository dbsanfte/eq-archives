These 2 guys are nothing more than messageboard trolls.  On top of
that, they are admittedly for Osama Bin Laden and the Iraqi insurgents
and have made less than savory cracks at our military heros who are
risking their lives overseas.

Send them a message by marking every one of their posts with 1 Star
and feel free to send them a PM as well.

Again, their names are IZIZ & FLYBIN
