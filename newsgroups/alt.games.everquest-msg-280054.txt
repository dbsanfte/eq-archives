That was the main reason I left EQ2.  It totally divided my guild in
several sections (those with access to Zek, those with access to EL,
those with no access, etc).  So every time we wanted to go to Zek,
someone couldn't so we ended up (for the 10th time) helping someone get
their access.  And when all finally could get in those places, then it
was time to go through the process all over again with Feerrot and the
other place.  Really stupid decision.  Sadly, they realized how stupid
it was after me and my guild faded away into WoW or GW or CoH.
