This isn't really right, or it's at least deceptive.

The French never expected the Maginot line to be attacked. The entire
point of it was to make Germany invade through Belgium, thereby
guaranteeing bringing the UK into the war.

The Ardennes was considered to be too rugged for a mobile invasion
force to invade through. This is true *as long as it was adequately
defended*. The French forgot that part (as did the Americans several
years later) and just assumed the Germans wouldn't try.

The Maginot line accomplished its objectives. The problem was the
supporting principles behind it were not followed through on. Even so,
though, there's no doubt the French would have been better served
spending the money on oh, say... an actual air force....

The European powers were well aware that the longer war was delayed,
the better shape they were in. If Germany had not gone to war in 1939,
the French would have had large numbers of a fighter capable of
standing in with the German bf109s, and the British would have had a
much better equipped (and larger) army along with a more modernized
navy. There's little doubt that had Hitler delayed - or been delayed -
much longer, he would have squandered his entire advantage. There's
still a lot of anti-Chamberlain, anti-appeasement rot out there. But
the truth is, though he made mistakes (Germany should have been
invaded the instant it attacked Poland, they didn't even probe to see
what was facing them), he really did know what he was doing, better
than most the armchair politicians.
