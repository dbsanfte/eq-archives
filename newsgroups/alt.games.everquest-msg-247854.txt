It's good to hear other people are having problems if only because i feel
less stupid for using bigpond broadband as my ISP :*)

My problems weird; mostly good then lose three pings then mostly good then
lose 3 and so on; but those 3 pings are all it takes to get munched, so i
can trade in the bazaar but not fight or anything and sometimes i go LD. I
ping telstra.com as a test so I know it's not the international link.I
suspect it's not a router issue, it's so regular, like the effect from the
pulse of machinery kicking in at regular intervals.

I hear Sony setup a server for EQOA in Australia but not vanilla EQ... don't
know if it's true but it wouldn't surprise me.

Man, I'm so hanging to get back to levelling, looking for a guild, trying
out my first LDoN!  I just can't find satisfaction with offline games
anymore.
