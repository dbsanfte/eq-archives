Have you actually tried it?  I've done this with several 
components, and it *never* works.  The pitiful thing is, 
I've offered to buy the wings in West Freeport before 
for 5 plat a stack, and not one person was a) clever 
enough to go buy a stack at the caster's guild and come 
get the reward or b) nice enough to let me know.
