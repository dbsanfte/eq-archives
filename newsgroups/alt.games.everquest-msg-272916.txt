Your class isn't readily apparent, although level still is if they can
target you.  The problem with this is if somebody is LFG and I'm doing
global /who all lfg commands, you don't get the class listed.  Why
somebody would go anonymous and LFG at the same time is beyond me, but
I ignore them when trying to put a group together.  Maybe that is a
benefit (not having to deal with one of my groups ;) )?
