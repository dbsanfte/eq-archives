We have a guild mage who seems to think there's some use to this thing
beyond duels - and trys to use it in raids (!).

The only thing I have overwrite TPP/XPG is PoT9 line.

Absolutely useless for 61+ players.  All 61+ pets are level 60 and
innately unfearable.

The only time I've seen my 61+ pets run is when it was tanking 
black reavers and would be blinded and knocked out of melee range
(or knock the BR out of melee range).
