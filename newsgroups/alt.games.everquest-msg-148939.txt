Last week a high end player on my server posted that she was retiring her
high end character who had grand master skill in everything under the sun.
In her post she asked if anyone really really wanted something like a
Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt and could not afford one to send her an email
and she would try to make them one.   I figured what the heck and sent her
an email asking her to make me one as I am not going to see that much pp in
my lifetime and my fletching skill is only at 177.  I did not expect
anything to come of it mostly because I figured she would be flooded with
requests from friends and although I have purchased things from her I have
never interacted with her in the game.  Last night she logged on one of her
alts while I was shopping in the bazaar and handed me the BFT.  This person
refused compensation of any kind and disappeared.  I am now the proud owner
of the best Tunare only bow in the game.  Sometimes I am amazed at how nice
people can be.
