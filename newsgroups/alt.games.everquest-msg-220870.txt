I said his first post, not the first statement in it.

Here's his sentence and your response in context:

Furor: A small, well tuned downgrade to certain aspects of being a
Knight would probably cause an uproar in the 'now' but over time would
go away as people adjusted properly to their roles. Your role isn't to
usurp my role - something it is currently doing.


Kaev: That's odd. I never knew that it was the role of one player in
one guild on one server to define the roles of the hundreds of
thousands of other players across nearly fifty servers involved in a
game he pays for the priviledge of playing just as we all do.


Furor was rather obviously not talking about "his" role, he was
talking about the role of a warrior. You attacked this message as if
he was claiming it was his role and no one else's.

The fact is he's not alone in what he's calling for, right or wrong,
and was never claiming to be, though you accused him of it. And if
that wasn't your intent, it was vague enough to fool me, and almost
certainly him as well judging from later responses.

I think it's pretty obvious now you did.


>  He was all bluster and arrogance. 

You assigned him way more arrogance than he was actually showing at
first. IMO he wasn't particularly aggressive until AFTER you attacked
him.


> The opening

Lie is far too strong a word. He was stating what he saw, nothing
more.

I never said Furor was right.
