Its not an 'illegal exploit' by SOE standards to the best of my 
knowledge. Its probably not how they intended the game to be played 
either though. But then neither was wiz/dru quad-kiting or necro-FD-
rotting.

I've done it myself in places like Echo Caverns with my enchanter from 
time to time, where it works very well. (Lots of mobs, solid gaurds, 
don't have to run too far...)

A variation on the tactic:

Instead of charming the mob, mez the gaurd, then melee/snare the fleeing 
mob, refreshing mez periodically. In many cases this is much more 
reliable than landing charm on the victim in time - especially if 
hunting reds or stuff that's higher level the the available charm.

Memblur the gaurd when you're done. Pull a new victim.
