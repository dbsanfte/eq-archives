  Some perceive this as a problem, others find it an obstacle that
usually isn't that difficult to get around.  Actually, it's very easy
to get around now that they've implemented chat channels that anybody
can understand (they will probably eventually be nerfed on FV, but for
the time being, they're there... I just hope they don't go too far
with the nerf, it's a great tool for raids, especially since there
isn't any zonewide /shout).

  Once you get up around level 30, between the languages you've picked
up and the languages everyone else has picked up, communication is not
difficult at all.  If you learn Human, Dark Elven and Elvish, you can
communicate with most people above level 25.  If you play a half-elf,
you start off with two of these languages right off the bat.

  This can be a problem.  You almost have to fight in "sheep zones" to
find a group, and even some of the sheep zones are empty (everytime I
pass through FM it's almost always empty).  However, if you join a
guild with any sort of active membership, this isn't much of a
problem.  It just means that the people you DO group with, you're more
likely to group with again in the future (or, not, if they make a bad
impression on you.)  Though it's rough if you refuse to join a guild
and play a class with little or no ability to solo, otherwise it's
actually pretty nice.

  The flip side of the coin is that most dungeons are completely empty
and you have the entire place for yourself, and there's less chance of
getting trained (or accidentally training others.)

  This is probably true, a lot of "true newbies" play on FV, but that
also adds to the server's "charm", in my opinion.  Most of the people
in my guild are either new to EQ, or new to playing the type of class
they've chosen to play, and it's been nice "growing up" together and
seeing ourselves mature as players.

  I won't argue here, there is a lot of nastiness between the
uber-guilds and wannabe ubers, which is somewhat dampening my
enthuasiam about reaching higher levels.  I don't want to get too
swept up in EQ politics and flamewars, and end up stepping on peoples
toes, or getting stomped on.  High level areas could end up getting
very crowded as more and more people level up without alts to divert
them.

  FV may not be for everyone.  TLC annoys some people, but for the
most part it does its job well and doesn't get in the way too much. 
The alignment grouping restrictions were what irritated me most when I
started playing on FV, especially since it meant I spent hours waiting
in Qeynos to get bound one day, because there was nobody around
capable of binding me who COULD bind me.  Thankfully the Soulbinders
have removed this particular problem.

  In my opinion, the key to enjoying FV is finding a guild you like,
then everything pretty much falls into place... at least that was my
experience.
