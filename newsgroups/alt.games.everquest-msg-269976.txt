That may be because there is now a viable alternative to EQ/EQ2, whereas
before there really wasn't.  And in this case, the other side of the fence
has greener grass.

Blizzard seems to have struck the correct balance of solo/group with WoW.
Folks can compare the two, see a better example, and can tell that the
emporer has no clothes.  Before they just had to deal with it because SOE
more or less had a corner on the market (in all deference to Mythic).

So is WoW.  The philosophical difference seems to be that WoW is multiplayer
in the vein of "multiple people playing", rather than SOE's "multiple people
required".

As of yet, I haven't come across anything in WoW as of yet where grouping
was forced upon a player if they wanted to accomplish a goal.  Sure,
grouping may make a task easier, but if you want to solo it you can. What
happens is that the strategy of the encounter changes if you choose to solo
it, as opposed to the encounter being non-doable without a group.
