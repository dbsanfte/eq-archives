As the game made travel easier and easier, people are going to bitch
incessantly if things are slow. When EQ first came out and druids and
wizards capable of porting were rare and charging way too much, people
sat and wait for the boats. They accepted it because the alternative
then was to fork over plat and back then people were not that wealthy.
So what did people do? Learned languages by gathering in groups,
skilled fishing, and other stuff.

But thanks to SonyJapan (Brad, and Verant please come back) and their
everquest to slowly dumb down the players, we have Magus and ports now
when they could have just added an additonal boat to the rotation
between any 2 docks.
