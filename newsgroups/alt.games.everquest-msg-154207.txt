<nods> when un-mezzable adds come in that hit pretty hard
and don't appreciate clerics healing the MT or 'chanters or
shamen slowing him or mages tashing, etc, you need a
guy/gal with 2 things:
(1) Ability to get aggro NOW, through something other
    than Taunt, damage (which is 0 at the start), and a EB
    proc...and
(2) AC/HPS to survive getting beat on a bit while the raid
    finishes the main focus of the pull.

SK/Paladins are A #1 choice for this...
