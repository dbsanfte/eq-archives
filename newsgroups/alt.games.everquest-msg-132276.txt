I have worked with Macs professionally, and I can tell you that they used to 
be *less* reliable than PCs, at least before MacOS X, but I believe there is 
more to a good computer than mere reliability. The Amiga was a notoriously 
unreliable beast, and yet I consider it a superior computer to the PC.

At any rate MacOS X is built on top of BSD Unix, so reliability shouldn't be 
an issue. And it has a command line :)
