There was a thread on this a while back, and as I recall the most
common view among the players who've fought a lot of dispelling
mobs is that the dispell seems to go down your list of buffs trying
to take them out until either it runs out of "dispell counters" or
buffs.  It seems like the buffs get a chance to resist the dispell
effect.  I've noticed that green dispelling mobs almost never knock
a buff off no matter how many I have up, high blue mobs usually seem
to nail at least one buff, and even or better mobs usually take out
multiple buffs.  Also, the higher the dispelling mob and/or the
lower my MR, the more likely the dispell is to take out the buffs
at the front, or so it seems.

Anyhow, if all of the above is correct then the best bet would be to
have as many crap buffs at the top of the list as possible.

Oh, and I've found the only "saving grace" of those damned chromas is
that they seem to have a poor MR, my DD/Stuns almost always seem to
land.
