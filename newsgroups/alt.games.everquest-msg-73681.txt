   You know what I hate?  When the stupid spell-
checker doesn't let you know that you've left out
a word of your post.  Usually, in my case
anyways, _the_ word that is capable of making
your entire, well thought out and bitingly funny
post come out as one big non sequitur.
   Stupid spellcheckers.

Annie  <--- Wonders how many critical words she may
            have left out of _this_ post.
