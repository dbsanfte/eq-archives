Put on some chainmail, head down to the local mall and continuously shout,
"Donating for KEI!"

Alternatives include going to the food court, sitting next to complete
strangers while they eat, and explaining earnestly that "you're just medding
until the next burger pops," or shoplifting to attract a few security guards
and bellowing "TRAIN TO PARKING LOT!"


Or, you could spend a measly few bucks and pay like everyone else.

Your choice.
