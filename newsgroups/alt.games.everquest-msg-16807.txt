Can't tell you how glad I was to see this happened on another server
than the one I play one. /shudder

This practice is a great way to get on folks "do not group no matter
what" lists.  I'm not certain that I would take the time to spit on such
a person, but I am sure that I not only would never group with them and
make certain that others knew not to, but I'd render them invisible. 
That means no aid if yelling for help and no chance of TPs, reses or
buffs from any of my chars.  This person should be shot, but there are
no guns in EQ.  Just MNSHO of course.
