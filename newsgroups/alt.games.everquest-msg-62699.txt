as someone mentioned, there have been numerous duping bugs throughout the
life of EQ. and as VI has become aware of them they have coded ways to
prevent them. currently the servers have an extensive tracking system that
i'm assuming keeps tabs on all items and can be checked rather easily for
duping. if you get trade scammed, the GM simply has to check the logs and
see what exactly happened, and what went where. every trade is recorded. and
i'll bet they have some kind of automatic check on these logs that detects
dupes that they know about. wouldn't be that hard to forward all the logs
through to some other machine or process that just parses them and checks
for that sort of thing.
