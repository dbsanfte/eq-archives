Welll, I dont know so much on that point...I've been forced to upgrade
once when Quake 1 came out...from 486/25 to p200MMX in early 97 and I also
upgraded to a Celery 300A base unit about early 99 but that wasnt
forced...though I guess it may have been by that Xmas when q3 showed.
Video wise I guess I went from V1 in the pentium to a V3 when they came
out, and the machine I have know went from 64 to 128meg middle of last
year. A lot of upgrading done isnt actually necessary if you target right
