OTOH:  if you don't recognize the aftermarket UI and have never played a
cleric and don't know that DA is Divine Aura, and your screen that you are
looking at this train on is not good enough to make out anything clearly
resembling Divine Aura, you might not have picked up on that little tidbit.
I suspect he got the part about zoning.  Except for Wood Elves, I think
everyone has to zone to get to the monsters.

Everyone was at one time or another, a beginner.
