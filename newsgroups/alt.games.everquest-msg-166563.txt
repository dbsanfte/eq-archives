Super high end  Monks were sometimes taking less damage than non-disc using
Warriors when the mob had ungodly ATK and was hitting for close to max all
the time no matter your AC purely and simply due to block firing more
often.  Clearly this was broken just like the ratio on bare fists at 65
thing was broken initially.

You could easily argue that taking less damage doesn't help a whole lot
when you cannot taunt for shit, are repeatedly stunned from the front and
have 2000 HPs less than the Warrior next to you in any case...

Because they had defensive (or whatever disc uber guilds favour now) and a
crapload more HPs than the equivalent Monks I guess.  Furor is 50 percent
hyberbole and 50 percent fact usually, he exaggerates to get results.

I bet most Warriors would trade most if not all of that for Mend *or* FD.
And isn't Stone Stance somewhat decent in any case?
