Very nice.

Hooray!  (said the Paladin)

Excellent idea...  that is, if the trade-in value is reasonable.

Dang it!  I really liked that about horses, this is a serious
drawback, especially since horses take a while to get back up
to speed after they've been stopped.

Hooray!  (#2)

Hooray!  (#3)  Man, that was annoying.

Hmm, I wonder if they also fixed the "directional spells don't
work when you're on a horse" bug.  For example, "Sense the Dead"
is supposed to spin you to face the nearest undead creature.
It didn't turn you at all if you were on a horse.

Double hooray!  IoF used to interrupt a lot if you were
walking after a mob beating on it as it ran.

Didn't they claim that was fixed a patch or two ago?

...about time...

Thank god.

Oh, so *that's* what the problem was...  This bit me 3 times.

I'll bet the "water tunnel" zone from N.FP to W.FP (or vice versa)
still fails to work if you're riding a horse...
