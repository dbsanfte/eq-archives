Ah!  Excellent solution.  Tightly control the rate at which items come into
the world.  Force people to camp items for 6 and 8 hours at a time before
they get them.  *This* will postpone the inevitable saturation of the items
until we can get our next game out in which we have a workable economic
system.  Keep stallin' 'em guys!

I hope that's the way they do it in SWGs too!  Fourteen hours of sitting on
my ass in front of this hut spawn and I'll have that final piece of my
lightsaber, so I can spend 12 hours ramping up a tradeskill to produce it
since it's no drop.

Unfortunately they aren't going to do it that way in SWG, because VI has
learned from the mistakes they've made with the EQ economic system.  Why
can't you?

Best Regards
