It's possible, but not likely.

If the file is heavily fragmented, then it may have to read the FAT a few
times to locate where the end of the file is, but that shouldn't be a
problem.

A defrag wouldn't hurt, though.

Make sure she has the same filter options as you do.  /showspelleffects,
/serverfilter, etc.
