Cross server chats can be done via a ;tell <servername>.<CharName>. If you
wanted to give me a tell youd do a ;tell torvon.Viarra <message>

Im most likely to be on either as Viarra, Tabifa, or Marianyax, been
enjoying the enchanter a LOT Lately :) Im not the best at responding to
tells though so it may take a few to get it to penetrate that Bone mass
attached to my forehead that I call a brain ;)
