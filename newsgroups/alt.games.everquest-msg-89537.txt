That's one thing I've noticed about AB... hardly any 'dewd-speak'...
although there IS a lot of swede-speak (and french... and danish... and
spanish) :o)

The stronger guilds don't seem to be full of 'wanna-be-first' types... maybe
they've got it out of their systems on their old servers. *shrug*
(I'll avoid calling them 'uber'... just cuz they don't call THEMSELVES
'uber')

The one good aspect of AB is that the low to mid level areas are pretty
deserted... I haven't had a single HG ks'd out from under me in North K
since I transfered (happened a lot on Prexus)
