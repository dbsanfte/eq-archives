I was referring to either twisting during downtime or not. If you stick 
with just one or the other, you start it and let it go, otherwise, you have 
to twist them to keep them both up. It's a lot let *strenuous* than keeping 
three or four going as in during a fight, but requires attention 
nonetheless. Twisting is twisting. Two songs is not necessarily any easier 
than three. You still wind up putting about the same energy into it.
