Actually, the door being mentioned is exactly what led me to think you were
talking about the same room, such as an often-seen (or rather,
often-not-seen) mobs tucked to the left and right of a door out of line of
sight behind the walls holding the door up.  Otherwise, why mention a door
at all?

Anyway, now that I know you're in Time and still worried about mobs who
mysteriously aggro through walls, I realize that my guild shouldn't face too
much of a challenge finishing our trip there.

After all, we've already figured out that mobs only aggro through walls when
someone does something wrong (or the very rare location-specific issue such
as Saryn's tower).

Of course, there's no *need* to see into another room, because unless you do
something wrong you're not gonna aggro the next room pulling this one right
here.  When people in my guild have aggroed mobs through walls, every single
freakin time when questioned they sat down on the wall or crouched to peek,
etc.

Opinions are wonderful things.

Just like my opinion that you in particular should be careful tossing around
the Ebaybee moniker.  Let me guess, used one guild to get your epic then
jumped ship to a more uber guild(s) until you coasted into Time?  It's great
that PoP made the uberguilds start recruiting so much that it worked out
that way isn't it?

I pulled my guild from 7 people on the roster to the elementals.  Feel free
to toss around some flames, cause that, without a doubt, speaks for itself. 
:P

I'll help you out on your previous post, though.  That stuff I snipped
because it made *you* look like even more of a numbskull...

> The 3 buffs (Symbol, AoF, Reso) - 638 HPs and 40 AC

I absolutely adored watching you catch me forgetting that hero doesn't come
until 52 while forgetting yourself that shield of words existed at all.  My
excuse is that my cleric was never my main.  What's yours?  :P

Oh yeah, we can also add to your numbskullisms the "636 hp" comment.  525 +
250 = 775.  Sorry to so totally show you to be a fool.  I tried to let it
slide.  Hell, you caught me forgetting something.  But you insisted on
bringing it up again.
