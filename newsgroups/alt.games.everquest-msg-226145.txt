I'm a 30 Ranger and have a Lamentation (Dmg 9 Dly 19) and Centi Shortsword 
(Dmg 12 Dly 25).  Which weapon should I have as primary and which secondary.  
I had heard somewhere to put the higher dely weapon as primary so I had the 
Centi SS as primary.  Then while in a group the other day was told to put the 
Lammy as primary.  How should it be?
