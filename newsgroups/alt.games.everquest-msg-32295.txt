Well, you _are_ right, it _is_ nice to have the opportunity to move chars.

I just think that 50 bucks is really a tremendous amount of money for a
piece of work that is most probably done in less than a minute, and I dont
think that it can be justified with, quote: "to eliminate the heavy burden
and cost it would put on the Customer Service Department".
Why dont they just create a web-front-end for that activity ? Just log in,
choose your character/account/whatever and it's new destination and press
"submit"...
Although I don't have any deep insights into Verant's "Everquest"-framework,
I assume it's all about moving a database table or two from one db to
another.

Nothing personal, just my humble opinion... :-)
