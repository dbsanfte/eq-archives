Well soloing is great, if you can. My alt rogue's guild
has it's first level 60 member, a rogue who has a
higher level druid from way back.  He has tons of
plat, and is very well equipped.  With his Mrylo BP
(self heal) he used his vacation time to play 10+
hours a day and went from level 56-60 + 4 or 5 AA
points in 8 days by soloing spiders in Velks.

My alt rogue can't solo anything but the lightest of
blues at 51, and then has to bandage/let her Iksar
BP regen her up all the way to full before she can
kill again.  Exp for her comes WAAAAAY faster in
a full group.  Especially because without being
able to FD, she has to zone.  Fight going bad?
Zone and then wait to heal all over again.  Pick
up an add when the one you've been fighting for
2 minutes is down to 10%? Zone and then wait
to heal all over again.

So yeah, soloing if done effectively will be better
exp ANYWHERE, not just Velk's.  But exp pulling
some statics and roamers on the first floor of
Hate is a great place to get exp without having
to worry about ANY competition from anybody.
