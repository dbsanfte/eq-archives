Yes I have this problem too on occasion. Everquest, like most online 
games, does use UDP. UDP packets will not be resent if they are lost, 
whether you are using NAT or not.

I have up to 4 PCs playing EQ at any one time, and its usually only one 
of them which ends up experiencing severe packet loss with the 
occasional linkdeath, while the other Everquest clients hum along 
without an issue.

A reboot does seem to rectify the problem temporarily. It also seems to 
be random, but usually within say the first hour or so of playing. I 
have no other network issues on my network so I am leaning towards 
pointing the finger at Everquest.
