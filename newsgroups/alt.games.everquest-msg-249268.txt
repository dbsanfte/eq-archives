There have been some threads going on how 'dumbed down' EQ has become.
The typical gripes about PoK and pretty much any modification that has
been implemented to facilitate travel and what not.

So i propose an experiment.

On all live servers have SoE simply freeze any and all travel benefits
that have been instituted since the original everquest minus the boats
designed to reach velious and what not. PoK IS still there,
Tranquility still works since that was designed to work from PoK, but.
all other books and stones are disabled. Maps are disabled and do not
work. FURTHERMORE, the /loc command is disabled... since really it
wasn't intended as part of the original game and was really just a
debug tool that ended up going live. In fact, while we are at it,
disable all graveyards including those in the planes. At the end of
one week post a poll and undo the changes.

Have you enjoyed your game playing time since this experiment has gone
active?
Yes/No

Would you like this experiment to continue on a permanant basis?
Yes/No

All i can say is be careful what you wish for.. and what you slogged
through years ago is hardly shiek or cool if actually put into effect.
