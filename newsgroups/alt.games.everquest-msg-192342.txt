It's the other way around, actually. A stack of gems often weighs a
lot less than the equivalent cash. Usually a gem weighs 0.1, which
means a stack of them weighs 0.1, and coins weigh something like 0.02
each, IIRC (not so certain about that), so a stack of peridots would
be about 190pp (IIRC you get 9.5pp for them with high CHA/faction) for
0.1 weight. Diamonds are of course even better, 3800ish pp for 0.1
weight.

It's like in table-top RPGs, after a while it's too much of a pain
carrying around tons of coin (unless you have a magic bag to put them
in) so you just take the gems and leave the coin (OK, so most of my
campaigns weren't like that, but there was this one campaign were we
killed a dragon and...). Monks in EQ just reach this point a lot
sooner due to encumbrance restriction.
