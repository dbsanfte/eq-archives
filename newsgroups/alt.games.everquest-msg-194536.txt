Oh, I thought you were suggesting that the two were of equal importance, so
either might be first.

I'm still not sure I agree that Regen 1, 2, 3 beats Improved Natural Metabolism,
for reasons I expounded on earlier.  In addition, for a bard, space may be
quite limited; I personally use only three bags, my other slots are filled with
hotkeyed swap slots for instruments and weapons, and my TBoots.  When I get Run
3 I'll be able to carry a 4th bag perhaps, looking forward to that! At any rate,
this means I use -one- stack of food and -one- of drink.  As a cat, I eat like
an ogre on a horse, so even banquets don't last forever at that rate, NM3 might
be worth getting (on a "I have to buy one of these lame AA's to get out of the
first tier" basis)

I keep seeing it suggested that regen is going to make a difference, but
comparing regen 1 to Cantata of Replentishment, I just can't see how you can say
that.  What am I missing?  Is regen a lot more HP per minute than I think?  Do
you have far fewer HP than I (I only have around 1600 at 57th level) so that
taking ten or 20 HP damage means a lot to you in a minute?  Do you normally solo
without Cantata memmed?  I can see where its better than all the stat and resist
AA's, and the Lung one... but I can't see it actually making any more than a
trivial bit of improvement for a bard.

I have to disagree with this.  This forum is a mixed class discussion area, and
that includes bards.  Diva is a specialty forum by and for bards and not much
frequented by anyone but bards.  Also, while there's overlap, I'll bet there are
bards that look here and not there, just as there are certainly bards that post
there and not here.

Personally, I like newsgroups and don't like web forums, I like my primative
newsgroup reader (netscape 4.7, yes I -know- its years out of date) and don't
want to learn a new one for every topic I'm interested in.  So I sometimes
browse thru the Diva site but never say anything there.

If noone posted anything to this forum simply because other forums exist, then
this would be one deserted wasteland of a newsgroup, wouldn't it?
