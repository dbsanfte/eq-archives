Hmm we seem to be in agreement after all . What exactly are the downsides of
my monk and my chanter again? I perceive a imbalance in druids and you seem
to be arguing against the fact the imbabalnce exists . Yet you turned your
back on a druid because of that imbalance. Normally I hear the must have a
disadvantage cry from clerics . Usually they are also clerics that where at
one time something else and for whatever reason couldnt hack it so they went
to the easiest class to gain experience and posistion in there virtual
lives.
