You need an Item with Spell Haste IV such as:

a.. Arantir's Sandals of Discovery

a.. Ceramic Totem of Xegony

a.. Cracked Bone Ornament

a.. Dumul's Sleeves of the Brute

a.. Elemental Slippers of the Prime

a.. Glowing Ore of Rapid Thought

a.. Half Spiked Sprocket

a.. Marsinger's Glimmering Gem

a.. Necklace of the Magistrate

a.. Shimmering Sleeves of Flame

a.. Silken Augmenter's Shoes

a.. Soulsip Sceptre

a.. Sparkling Necklace of the Chosen

a.. Tallon's War Charm

a.. Tormentor's Chain Collar

a.. Vorshar's Slippers of the Blight

and the effect is:

1: Increase Spell Haste by 15%
2: Limit: Max Level(65)
3: Limit: Spell(Complete Healing excluded)
4: Limit: Min Casting Time(3.00 sec)
5: Limit: Effect(Percentage Heal excluded)

On the one you got, it's for detrimental spells only and even though Slows
seem detrimental to you, they don't do any damage to the mob.
