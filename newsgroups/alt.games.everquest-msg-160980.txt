Gimp tactic (we've NEVER done this) for rooted mobs to prove the above

MA attacks a rooted mob   <- first on agro list   <- does damage
MA steps out of battle
MA self heals (e.g bp heal)  <- now has heal agro to add to his "hate"
MA now has firm agro when the raid engages.

Being the first person to agro a mob seems to rank on agro too (generally
whoever pulls of me and a friend, is the one who usually tanks the fight -
both monks)
