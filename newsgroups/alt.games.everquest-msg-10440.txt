    Confess, I never thought of that.
    Well you learn something new everyday.
    I just may do that the next time a druid is about to make my A-Hole list
for this behaviour.

    PS in regards to all my comments on this subject, my two best friends in
game (one in life) are a druid and a ranger.  While I don't play either
class, I do know which side of a tree to look for lichen.  I don't have any
issue with the method, I just have issue with people who earn my contempt.
