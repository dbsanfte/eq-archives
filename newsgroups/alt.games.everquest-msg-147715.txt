Ok why do most american homes have air conditioners and most european homes
not? Is a microwave in every european home? Why do a huge number of
europeans go elsewhere to have surgery done, one of the places they go alot
is HERE ! You want to know why perhaps? Ill tell ya . If you refuse people
health care because it is expensive , after awhile those people cant ask for
it anymore.

Given the choice of paying for expensive surgery necessary for life or
letting the goverment steal money to pay for it and then only helping
deserving people , I am REALLY gonna prefer the method where the goverment
dosent say you have lived long enough and we really cant afford more so just
die now please. This happens everday in europe for procedures that are
considered BASIC < EASY> AND NORMAL HERE!

You fault my example yet produce one really skewed :p What is the population
of europe compared to land mass. Now do that calculation for the United
States. Get yourself the nice sardine packing multiplier and then compare
again. Europe dosent have very many houses worth that much :p
