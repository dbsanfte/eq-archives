Hahaha! As if he'll find newbies in the swamp! I remember back in the
day, when I was a wee trollip[1], how lonely I was in that swamp, with
nobody to keep me company but an army of frogloks... And every now and
then, a party of lighties on their way to Lower Guk, who would buff me
to the hilt, of course...

Ah, those were the days, running amuck amongst the froggies with high
level damage shield, speed buff, and Skin Like Nature... Once, I took
a screen shot of me surrounded by a dozen dead Frogloks, all killed in
one such frenzy, all blue to yellow. And I didn't beg for those buffs,
either, the lighties were just surprised at seeing an actual troll in
the swamp, and decided to buff me for my novelty value!

OK, maybe trolls aren't *that* rare, but there aren't enough of us,
damn it! EQ trolls, I mean, not the other kind.
