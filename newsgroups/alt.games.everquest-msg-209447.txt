"Backbeat Downbeat" is a netkook and long-time troller of the necro boards who
has taken to trolling the eqdiva board (maybe not as often now, due to a recent
thrashing). Popular opinion on the necro board is that this is the person who
used to post as "Magisterdark" and had a meltdown several months ago, editing
all his/her/its posts replacing the previous contents with a "1".

So, Mags, this 1's for you.
