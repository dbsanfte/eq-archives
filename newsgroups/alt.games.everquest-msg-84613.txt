This isn't that important as lower levels, but when you're dealing with 
mobs that can't be mezzed or charmed, and hit for 200pt, and require an 
off-tank to control, yeah, it's damn important.  Hell, now that we have 
target picker, MA, SA, and off-tanks designated on big raids, we 
absolutely need to know which target a person is on.  
Especially when two of our main tanks are both trolls in very similar 
gear.  (As in you can't tell them apart in battle without names turned 
on.)
