This is so sad.  You are like a battered wife who is sure that it is
all her fault, that her husband must beat her bloody every night.

The true legacy of Verant's customer service having to cover for their
pathetic programming and design is that any time someone comes up with
a clever strategy, instead of slogging through the problem like a
bulldozer, they become twitchy, anxious and worried that uncle Verant
will punish them for not following some imagined "vision."
