I had to wipe my hard drive and start anew, I've got all the cds and was
wondering if i have to reinstall kunark and vellious as well as luclin, or
does luclin automatically install the files for the others when it patches,
since i have the expansions enabled on my account? Considering how huge the
amount of patches i'll have to download, i didn't want to try it and see.

And is there any way to use my full amount of ram in win me, or do you have
to cap it at 512 meg?

Thanks to anyone who answers this, or even thinks about it.
