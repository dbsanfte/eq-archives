This is true. I used to take my ranger in there on the pretence of hunting
poachers and when nobody was looking, 'accidentally' kill a grisly or two in
the hunt for a HQ so chandra miller would make me some decent armour. I remeber
the folks in surefall werent too keen on the millers, does killing them raise
surefall faction?
