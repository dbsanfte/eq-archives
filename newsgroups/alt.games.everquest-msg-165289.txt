Not true (or at least not according to the email that contained the
code).  It is a trilogy account with 5 days free, meaning you have
to pay to continue playing the account after the 5 days are up, just
like your first 30 days are "free" when you buy the trilogy in the
box.  You would have to buy SOL and POP to get activation codes for
them tho, if you wanted them on the new account.
