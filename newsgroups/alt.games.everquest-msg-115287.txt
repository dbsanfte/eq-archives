It is the aviak island. A cleric quest armor item drops there as well
as a shaman wisdom range slot equippable spear. Those drop off two 
named rares. That is why the guy was there killing the birds. The
birds claws(or feet or whatever) DO work in the paladin guild quest in
kaladim (they ask for aviak or aviak chick feet) However I never got
enough to tell if they are better XP than the normal aviak feet from
butcher. You'd certainly get a lot more of them though.

The right way of getting there is the way you did, basically. You get
off the boat or take off with levitate from sister's island or some
other island after you know the loc ( /loc ) 

No one ever does this island so it would be something kind of cool to
do on a brand new server like kayne bayle. I think you can start
killing the lower ones around level 14? I believe the rares are blue
to a level 35.
