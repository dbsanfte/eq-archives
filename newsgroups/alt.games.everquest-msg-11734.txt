I've never heard of a magic number for Sta, though there certainly
could be one. I doubt 7 sta will kill you, I'm sure you can find some
eq to make up the difference. 7 sta will probably equal about 35 hps
at level 25, nothing too major. If it really bothers you, just restart
him, with the experience of your other chars getting back to level 10
shouldn't take more than a few gaming sessions.
