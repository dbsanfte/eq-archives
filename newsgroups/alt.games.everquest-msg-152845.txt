Yes there is a limit.  Your first idea was probably thought of by Verant &
done to prevent AFK gaming or other type of acts.  Your second idea would
work assuming someone made the proper setup for it.  Problem might be
getting the weight to fall off of the key almost immediately.  Maybe a ramp
type of setup may work with the top of the ramp on the key, that way the
object falls onto it & bounces or rolls off.
    I do like that you came up with an idea that would work though has
NOTHING to do with EQ, software, or Windows...and therefore is more likely
not to fail due to software glitch.
