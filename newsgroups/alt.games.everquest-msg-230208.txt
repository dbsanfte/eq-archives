Interesting assortment of opinions on this topic, I'm surprised. There's no
question in my mind about the value of Infusion of Spirit in most
circumstances, it's one of my most powerful and appreciated buffs, and a
main staple in my buffing arsenal.

As has been pointed out, the primary difference between IoS and HoS is that
IoS stacks with all of the single stat buffs, including STR and DEX. HoS
does not. The advantage of HoS and Focus lines, of course, is that they're a
single slot buff which is much better in a raid environment (particularly
when you start getting the group versions). Whenever I buff someone with IoS
and then put a STR and a DEX on top, I am usually maxing out their DEX and
STR. My usual practice in an exp group is to buff MT with IoS, STR, DEX, AGI
and STA, and then also cast Talisman of Kragg (395 HP that stacks with IoS
but not HoS). They love it.

I got my IoS on the 2nd EP turn in. Yes, it was worth it :)
