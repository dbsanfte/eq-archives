It violated the spirit of the rules. The "following the letter of the
law" bullshit will get you smacked just as quickly as outright
violating the rules. If you read the policy completely, you'll also
see that GMs  interpret the rules and make decisions based on that.
You KNOW what the intent of the rules are. If the name violates that
intent, quite simple: Pick another name.
