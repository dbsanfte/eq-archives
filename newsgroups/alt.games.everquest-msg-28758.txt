>> Using any third party software violates the licencse agreement doesn't
it? <<

Depends on what it does. The first line of paragraph 9 of the EULA says:

"You may not use any third party software to modify the Software to change
gameplay."

The last three words are the kicker. I use EQu, which allows me to easily
change text colors, lock and unlock the boxes, choose which boxes I want up,
modify my friend/ignore list, and many other things that don't change
gameplay.

Now, if I used third party software to go from level 1 to level 60 in an
hour, or give me 999,999 hp and mana, then I would be in violation.
