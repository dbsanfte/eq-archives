My God.  It's really amazing, the stupidity, ain't it?  Y'know, if that had
been me and I had a root spell I'd have cast that on him:

Noob_01: u fucktard i am on a CR dammit. gimme a sow!
Me: Oh.  Man.  I'm really sorry, I didn't realize or I would have SoWed you
right away.
Me: Here you go man, enjoy.

I cast Root on Noob_01

A few seconds pass during which Noob_01 turns around in circles and looks
confused.

Noob_01: dude its not working.  i cant move.
Me: Oh man I'm sorry, might have cast the wrong spell... here, I'll try it
again.
Noob_01: ok man but you better get it right this time or my lvl 60 friend
will beat you up.
Me: Ok, ok, I'm doing it!  Just don't let him kill me!

I cast Flash of Light on Noob_01

Noob_01 stands still for several seconds then goes Linkdead as he restarts
his computer.

Nyuk nyuk.
