yes, by the time your killing the gnolls you may have better...
but most people destroy these scrolls, and a young player could go
here and do an ooc or go to a camp and politely ask if you can loot
them.
also when your of the level to get the scrolls yourself, you can do
the quest and turn the reward into plat in the bazaar.... Ive seen
these gloves go for  50 - 150 pp there.
