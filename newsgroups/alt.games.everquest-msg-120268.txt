I have been killing Frost Giants and Drakkal Dire Wolves outside Thurgadim
trying to improve my faction to Ally (which hopefully will make me
Indifferent to CoV and Wuoshi).

I am currently up to Amiable to the Coldains.  Can anyone give me an
estimate of how many Frost Giants I need to kill to get to Ally?

BTW, I know it will go faster if I kill them in Kael Drakal but as a Druid
42, I don't do very well indoors!
