Nah, thats very benign. What about the wandering newbie ogre who goes LD and
decides to make a run to zone... oh but hes wandered near the sw corner of
feeroot. ugh. More ugh if he actually makes it.
Anyway default behavior for a level 1 newbie should probably be do duke it
out with the monster. After that the person has to choose the default
behavior themselves.
