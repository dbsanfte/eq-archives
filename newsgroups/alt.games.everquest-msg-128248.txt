    The Bazaar is coded in such a way that it is the only zone where turning
PCs into NPCs would work. It is the only zone I know of where (excepting in
the arena area) nobody can be attacked. Would you like to find out what
happens to a PC vendor if they're attacked and killed? I know I wouldn't.

    You don't need Luclin to sell goods. You need Luclin to sell goods in
this manner. I'm sure the /auction channel won't disappear overnight.

    Guess it depends on how many taxi characters your server has. I've bound
all my characters except one (and with the Bazaar going live, that one will
soon be moved there too) either in The Nexus, The Bazaar, or Shadow Haven.
The advantages are many:

(1) Within easy running distance of The Nexus are zones where all of my
characters can either get a group or solo non-light blue mobs. And when I
say "easy run" I speak as a character with no invisibility (but with ITU,
which is available in shaman potions) that used to do all this travelling
with no speed boost faster than Run Speed I (I've since upgraded to III).
(2) The ports down from The Nexus, which I can use whether a porter is
online or not, give me easy access to Velious up to Kael, all of Odus, all
of Faydwer, the western half of Antonica, and any part of Kunark between
Chardok and Firiona Vie. That is a ton of content - places I care about that
are missing are Sebilis, Howling Stones/OT, Cobalt Scar to Western Wastes,
Sol A/B, EC, Guk and Grobb.
(3) For a tradeskiller, Shadow Haven is the best zone in the game. By far it
has the most supplies for tradeskills, and getting faction there is very
straightforward.

    Druids get ports to three of the zones that have Nexus-bound spires. One
of them, Dreadlands, is hazard-free travel between the ring and the spire
barring some nimrod training ruin undead to one of the two. Wizards, of
course, can port to all four. The only difference between a port and this is
this may take up to 15 minutes maximum longer. Access is only an issue to
those that do not have Luclin, or who cannot function in a Luclin zone.
