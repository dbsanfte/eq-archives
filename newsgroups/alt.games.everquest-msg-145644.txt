Some of the higher end players do, but as to the Subject, that depends
on what your view on being a shaman is.

Most people will tell you that if you are a warrior, just learn 1HS,
2HS and 1HB and dont worry about the other.  My VISION of what a
warrior is says that I should be the master of all weapons.  That I
should be able to pick up any weapon type and fight effectively.

Think about what you SEE your shaman as being.  Perhaps your shaman
isnt the type to fool around with the Alchemy thing.  Perhaps your
shaman is simply one to dabble in it (getting no farther than the
commonly desired low level potions).  Perhaps he or she is fanatical
about alchemy and will spend every last copper to learn the art of his
forebearers.

Are you going to make a lot of money at it?  Nope.  Are you going to
spend a ton of money?  Yes, emphatically yes.

I am engaged to a shaman in the game and her motto is "Alchemy Sucks"
but rest assured that she will take it to the top level simply because
it is what a shaman is to her.  :-)
