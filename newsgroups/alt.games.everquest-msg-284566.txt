Cleric stun does have a long recast time, however, clerics get not one, 
but... four?  more than four really.  This means cast 1, cast 2, cast 3, 
cast 1 = total stun lock.  On CHealing mobs, stun lock for the final 40% 
or so of a mob's life can be a far more efficient use of a cleric's mana 
than healing the tank, who after all isn't taking any damage due to the 
stun lock.  Meanwhile, you kill the mob once instead of three or four 
times over.

Barring stun lock, watching for a mob to begin casting, and 
interrupting, again stopping a probable CHeal or Gate, now we're talking 
a very cheap mana per effectiveness, since its only the higher level 
stuns that cost noticable mana.

Cleric nukes have a fairly nice damage to mana ratio, actually, its the 
recast time that prevents them being a high DPS class... except on 
undead, where despite a worse mana to damage ratio than their real 
nukes, they get a fast cycle time and can really lay down the hurt if 
they want to.

In an AOE group, clerics can lay down a noticable amount of PBAOE 
damage, after keeping the chanters afloat during the pull phase, and of 
course being available to rez the group afterwards if things go badly 
(unfortunately, this will happen eventually if you AOE regularly)

Depends on the target, on some mobs cleric DPS is very significant, 
because the procs are... well I'm tempted to say unresistable, but there 
may be mobs which resist them.  I never saw it happen myself.  With a 
capped dex, the hammer procs like mad, clerics certainly have a good 
chance of outdamaging warriors, paladins, and meleeing bards (which is, 
I know, faint praise).  I'm not sure this means a better use for their 
time than sitting and healing though.

> 	I'm asking if this is a correct view not arguing with yours.

You passed over Lull, which is actually a major contribution in some 
groups in some camps; fighting one mob at a time is much more efficient 
than fighting three or four, and if only one comes when you pull, you 
don't have to worry about root or mezz parking the adds.

Faeandar skipped Fear, which again in some camps, some groups, can mean 
a great deal, fear kiting is often a much more efficient way of dealing 
with mobs than anything else, it shuts down mobs which may dish out 
overwhelming DPS in melee, and it shuts down casters.  Chromodracs in SF 
come to mind simply because I've been hitting them a lot recently, but I 
also recall hunting the drakes in Cobalt Scar for fun and profit when 
noone else would even touch them, with their 500 point AE with dispell. 
  A snaring partner is necessary usually for this (although those 
Drakes, and Specters, for two examples, don't require it)

Here's a fun trick; root an add, lull it, then cast Atone.  Root wears 
off, it just stands there, or wanders off, because the lull reduced its 
aggro range, and the atone erased its memory of whatever made it add, 
and of you rooting.  Ghetto mezz, workable in emergencies or in places 
like Kael where the mobs are unmezzable.

Mark of Redemption is a fairly tiny heal, but can be very effective on 
certain mobs because it overwrites their DS, and does so with laserlike 
precision, instead of trying to brute force it off via annuls... which, 
on other mobs, is also very effective use of mana, sometimes without 
their buffs mobs become cheesepuffs.

Hammer pet, over a certain range of mobs, is also an effective DPS 
engine; I'm very dissapointed that there was no upgrade for 61-65, nor 
66-70... and for that matter really thought they should have added a 
smaller lower level one when they added the low level HOTs and undead 
only DOTs for the class.  I fondly remember soloing Lord Bergurgle at 54 
by chain stunning him while the pet beat him to death.

I think part of your myopia about clerics is the inevitable focus on the 
high end game; after all, most people get stuck up there eventually, and 
spend half their EQ career there.  Many classes see tactics that were 
very effective at lower levels fade into obscurity at the high end. 
Clerics, sadly, are no different in this regard.
