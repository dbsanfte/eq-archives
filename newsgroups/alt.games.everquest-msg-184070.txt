He's actually not the worst of the three, from what I can remember.  He does
DT every 30 seconds or so (sue me if it's like 45 seconds, I just don't
remember :p ) so you're going to lose a few people.

I really wouldn't bother having an MA/SA/TA on it...when he gets to camp,
just beat & nuke the crap out of him.  Yup, some folks will die from his
melee, others will die from DT, but the faster you kill, the fewer deaths
you'll take.

The main thing, I think, you have to keep in mind is he really isn't THAT
tough...don't let him psyche you out, just jump in and kick ass.
