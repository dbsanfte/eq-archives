Yes being in the game means a person accepts Verant's policy about being
inspected. They do not have to like it though and have every right to make
their opinion known. Calling people names because they have an opinion that
you do not happen to agree with suggests other traits though. Not that you
have any. Not wanting to be inspected may be a paranoid trait for some but I
really doubt it. For most it is just a simple matter of convenience. A way
to avoid certain situations that are annoying and it truly hurts no one on a
non PvP server that they do not know all of the gear another player is
wearing.
