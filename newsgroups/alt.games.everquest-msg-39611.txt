Isn't there a rumour that there is going to be a global auction area in
SOL ?
Could it be that you could "bank" for sale items in a "pawn shop" and
sell them that way ?

E.g. I go to SOL-Market and put my armour up for sale at 200pp
Three weeks later some one buys it, I get 180pp and the market gets the
10% mark up.


Perhaps it could be a sort of closed auction type of thing. First bid
over x or the highest bid in the next 2 weeks.

That would be real useful.

Jim
