}> Shoot, I wouldn't.  The very name screams black helicopters at me.
}Let me clarify.  What I mean is a department whose function is to gather
}information regarding threats from outside to this nation and to find
}effective solutions to those problems.  I don't mean a department who spies
}on American citizens or residents in a "Big Brother" way to find internal
}dissent.  "Homeland Security" can be taken to mean either protecting the
}homeland from outside threats or protecting the homeland's government from
}internal threats.  I agree with the first goal, but not the second, and it
}seems the new department is here for the second goal.

I have trouble imagining a department given the powers to accomplish the 
first goal that would not be led to bleed well over into the second goal.

}> }The problem is the create of a "Big Brother Department" which

}I'm sure I'll hear a lot of irate posts about this, but personally I think
}I'd rather have the World Trade Center blown up than see America become a
}Nazilike state.  And although I don't think the American people would stand
}for something like that, it looks like the "Department of Homeland Security"
}is gradually trying to become an American Gestapo.  I find it unsettling.
}That is not to say I wouldn't enjoy seeing Osama bin Laden suffer in
}extraordinary ways for what he did -- nothing would please me more.  For
}some reason I can't find it in me to like the guy much.

/agree.  Except I'm not all that eager to watch him suffer.  I'd much 
rather he was just dead.

}> }> Not very conservative.  It's an expansion of government into the lives
}> }> of citizens.  That includes the war on drugs.
}> }The war on drugs is a joke.  They're not stopping shit, all they're doing
}> }is punishing random people for doing something to themselves, not to 
}> }anyone else.  The government should not have the right to protect you 
}> }from yourself.
}> Yup.  Total agreement.  They can have the right not to have to fix
}> problems I brought on myself though.  All I see the War on Drugs doing is
}> providing price supports for drug dealers.
}I'm not saying that the government should fix your life if you destroy it
}with drugs... but if they're really so eager to help, they would do a lot
}more good trying to provide therapy for users than fighting this stupid war.

Yeah, if they want to help with carrots rather than sticks, three cheers 
for them.  But they shouldn't be obligated to.

}This is precisely what I was trying to say in my previous posts... a parent
}has every right to express their opinions and moral values to their
}children, and that is the way they should raise their kids.  Trying to
}prevent them from having condoms is not an acceptable way to convince them
}not to have sex.

Well, it's not an effective way, even, so if effectiveness was a criterion 
for acceptability... :)

}For Sanjian's benefit:  As you may notice if you read my previous posts, I
}never said you don't have the right to impress your moral values on your
}kid.  As a matter of fact, I think that's your duty as a parent, even if I
}don't agree with said moral values.  What I disagree with is your desire to
}force your moral values by increasing the probability that he will be
}seriously harmed if he doesn't follow your advice.  That's like telling your
}kid not to ride your motorcycle because he might get hurt, then putting
}pointed stakes in your driveway while he's asleep so if he gets up and tries
}it, he'll be impaled if he doesn't look first.

Or perhaps secretly removing his brake line.

}> }All right... while I agree that the government should not regulate your
}> }personal life and while I do think that in some cases the government
}> }interferes in people's family life too much... with all due respect your
}> }family does *not*, I repeat *not*, belong to *you*.  Your family members
}> }belong to *themselves*.  While it's ok and necessary to punish your kids
}> }when they're wrong and to raise them to have certain values, if you hurt
}> }them you're not hurting an object in your posession, you're hurting a
}> }human being.  I know I speak from a valid standpoint because my own
}> }family life very nearly killed me.  I'm not trying to condemn Remington
}> }for what he does with his family, I don't know anything about him... but
}> }it is *not* "your goddamn family".
}> Would you settle for "our goddamn family, and not the government's"?  I
}> did not intend to imply that I had sole exclusive control of my family in
}> a way that impinged on their control of themselves.
}> Corporal punishment is a very difficult question that I don't think will

}> child for having tried for the sixth time to run into the Flaming Inferno

}> other hand, there's administering a bone-breaking belt-whupping for asking
}> "why?" to everything you say for half an hour.
}All right, Remington, I guess I should apologize to you.  I kind of flew off
}the handle there because what you said is almost word-for-word what my
}father used to say

No problem, here's your handle back. :)  It was a valid criticism, I 
hadn't spotted that my words could be read in that tone of voice. :)

}But I get the impression that you're talking about laws against spanking and
}such, and you do care about raising your kids properly.  So... sorry I
}blasted you :)

Well, it's more that I wasn't talking about corporal punishment at all, 
but more about issues like whether, if our family feels that Joe is a 
member of it, even though there's no genetic basis for that, and he's not 
involved in a marriage of opposite genders with another family member, 
shouldn't his membership of our family be generally a matter that -we- 
settle, rather than some court somewhere?

}> }It is your responsibility to raise your kids to be healthy because you
}> }brought them into the world.  But they are not there for you, you are
}> }there for them.  Period.
}> We are there for us.  But then, that's a statement of -my- family values.
}> Which may differ from yours, and may differ from those outlined in the
}> Republican Party platform.
}I'm not sure what you mean by "we are there for us."  You'll have to
}elaborate.

You're saying 'they are not there for you'.  This is untrue.  Many is the 
time my family has been there for me when I needed them.  You say, 'You 
are there for them'.  Ok, well, I try to be.  So to sum up: if the family 
needs us, we are there.  If we need the family, it is there.  We are there 
for us.

}I don't follow the Republican Party platform, or any other
}platform for that matter, for my personal moral and family values.  I
}determine my own values according to what seems appropriate to me, and if I
}am wrong, I'll take the consequences. 

And this is precisely the freedom that I'm accusing the Republican Party 
Platform of stating an intention to endanger.

}But what I meant by the above statement is that you are there to take 
}care of your kids and raise them to be healthy and mature, they are not 
}there for the purpose of being model kids for you to show off, like some 
}people I've known seem to think.

Sometimes I think showing off your kids might be good for them, though.  
It can give them as much pride (in the sense of self-worth sense, not the 
'seven deadly sins' sense) as it gives you.  Like all things, it can be 
done way wrong though.
