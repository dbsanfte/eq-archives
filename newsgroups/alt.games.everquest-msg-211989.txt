Given the stupid exp bonuses available in PoP, a player will spend
maybe a week in their 50's and get to 65 inside of a month (at level
65, I get 1% normal exp for 2 trash kills in PoV/BoT/Hate).  It's
better to pick a weapon that will work well at 65 even if it costs
more (especially since money is ridiculously easy to get--a single
metalic liquid sells for 2kpp, any ornate drop sells for 20+Kpp,
etc...) rather than picking a weapon that's "good" at mid 50's but
begin to suck wind at 65.

The big selling point of the "beefy" 2h'ers is NOT the big hits.  It's
the fact that with PoP mobs and their stupidly high damage output,
dual weilding low delay weapons while standing toe to toe will result
in 700+ smacks from ripostes.

Hell, some of the boss mobs hit for over 3000 per hit.  One riposte
and you're roadkill.

There's a very good reason why 2H weapons are popular these days, it's
not because of their big hits.

>1h really is
>probably the best option for such a ranger.

As long as that ranger always stands behind the mob.  If he stand
infront, forget it.  One bad series of ripostes and the ranger may be
in "low health" in which case, even a chain casting SK isn't going to
keep aggro.  And a dead melee does no damage.
