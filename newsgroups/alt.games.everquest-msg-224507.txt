There are various recipe books in game, which are of varying degrees of 
usefulness, much like the older ones you have probably seen before.  I 
always use eqtraders for my tradeskill questions.  There are tons of new 
recipes added to the game since you went away.  There are also many items 
that, as Justin said, have no known use, but are flagged as tradeskill 
usable.  Eqtraders has a list of known "no known use" items, or at least 
had one.
