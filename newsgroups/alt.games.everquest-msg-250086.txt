The list is "raid crap" because the raid leaders were doing the
talking. They have reams of material from non-raiders to read
through, which they said in their statement. I'm not sure how
this confuses people.

Except for the fact that patch on patch they've been fixing bugs
as they can isolate them. Don't get me wrong, it should NEVER
have been pushed live in the state it was in, but they've nearly
got most of the bugs out of collision. (Still has problems but
walling is *better*, mobs in floors is *better* etc)

You don't call it an improvement to be able to have petitions
answered when you're offline so you don't need to wait around
and re-petition? Or that they can reimburse items when you're
not online? Or that the relevent /bugs etc now go directly to the
people responsible for them? OK...

I mean you quote a lot of stuff from Steelwarrior but about
half of it isn't for GoD/Time geared guilds, about a third of it
you agree with...
