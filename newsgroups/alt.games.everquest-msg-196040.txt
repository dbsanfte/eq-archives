I know nothing about the quest, but, I would guess that you need to hit the 
combine button on the box when all the coins are in it.  Then turn it in.  
That is typical for that type of quest.  Also, when you don't hit combine, 
and turn in the box, the items will disappear if they are nodrop (I believe 
that is the cause).  By hitting combine, the box usually will change into a 
single item, that usually will fit inside another container now, and is not 
an openable container anymore.
