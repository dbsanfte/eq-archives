Here's a weird one - it takes me so long to zone between Butcherblock (when
leaving Kaladim Port on the transports) that by the time I have zoned into
Timorous Deep, to get the boat to Firiona Vie, the transport is on its way
BACK round the boat and I immediately zone back to Kaladim Port on the
transport still.

Have defragged disk to see if it speeds up any, but I can't see any other
solution. I don't *need* the boat at the moment, but I will do!

Any ideas?
