Wrong... this shit's being going on for centuries, and shows absolutly NO
sign of ever stopping. Your basic premise is flawed, in that even when every
martyr in THIS generation dies, their children WILL start over, with the
added incentive of avenging their fore-fathers.

Again, wrong.

As soon as you have ONE person who is 'willing to die' then you have a dozen
or more who are 'unwilling' to die, but quite happy to 'avenge the wrongs'.

At that point, it's no longer about 'the issue' but devolves into personal
animosities and vendettas... even between people who are ostensibly
'allies'. As soon as one fight is won, the arguments over who won it begin.

But you DO advocate such civilised behaviour as 'detention without trial'
and 'state sponsored murder'... well done, your tolerant attitudes do you
credit.

Which is of course a silly idea... Saddam gasing his own, unarmed, people
would never disturb another government... after all, it's his people, why
should anyone care?

On the contrary... the sacrifice of a single martyr in a suicide bombing can
have devastating consequences for the 'projection of power'. When a suicide
bomber attacked the Marine Corps barracks in Beruit, Lebanon, the result was
a withdrawal of US military personel from the country on the grounds of
security considerations. From a terrorist perspective, this was a perfect
'operation'... military casualties, civilian outrage, US policy change.

The TV pictures of an injured, naked marine being carried from the rubble on
a stretcher, covered in blood and dust was a vivid one, and served the
purpose it was meant to. The fact that the poor bastard was black was a
bonus... it implied that 'white' America was sending black kids to die in a
foreign land. Everyone knows that that's a raw nerve amongst "The American
People".

Yes... US Airforce Carpet Bombs Afghan Wedding Party... that was handled
well.

And THIS, ladies and gentlemen, is why the US is hated by millions.

This is the reason why the US is in the middle of an escallating trade war
with the EC.

This is the reason why the US Budget Defecit is back after less than 2 years
of 'Dubya' in charge.

Define 'meaningful'

4000 dead
4 Airliners destroyed
WTC is now a crater
Damage estimated at over $1 Billion

Sounds pretty meaningful to me!

Nations do not go to war FULL STOP.

PEOPLE go to war.

Last time, there was the excuse that Saddam had invaded a neighbour... THAT
is the only reason a multi-CULTURAL coalition survived.

This time...
Saddam has made no threats against his immeadiate neighbours.
Isreal is becoming more heavy-handed in its suppression of the Palestinians
and US has kept too quiet about it.

Next time...
Who knows?
