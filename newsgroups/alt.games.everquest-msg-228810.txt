I didn't mean to be insulting, was merely using your terms against you.

(Doesn't feel good?)

How on earth would conjuration, you know, the school that is used for 
summoning, which is the raison d'etre of magicians, be stupid and illogical?

Unless of course you are a min-maxer, looking at your choices back 
before conjuration was a decent one, that is.

(Oooh, as you seem to be anti min-maxing, does that one hurt?)

I don't actually think evocation is stupid and illogical, but I do think 
its a -different- choice, a slightly strange choice, -not- the bedrock 
easy decision you seemed to portray it as.  From a roleplaying 
standpoint, its the "I always wanted to be a wizzard, but mom made me 
take mage classes instead" choice.    From a players' standpoint, its 
the "pet, schmet, I'm going to be good at blowing holes in things" choice.

Many's the time I considered wiping my specializations and going to 
Alteration; it was my first specialization to hit 50 other than 
conjuration, which I force fed, and it was very often the highest of my 
normal casting skills.  Coming from a clerical background, my instincts 
are always to keep the pet alive and only secondarily to worry about 
nuking as mana permits.  I've resisted doing so because I feel it would 
principly help me to solo, and that groups deserve me to be at my best 
in a grouping environment, which meant either conjuration or evocation.

If you want to really prove yourself anti-efficiency, though, you'd have 
to pick either abjuration or (nobody's favorite) divination.

We have five schools of magic because spells are divided into five 
schools for -all- classes (songs aren't spells so don't go there).  This 
does not mean that all schools are equally sensible choices for all 
classes.  I don't think any class would benefit from choosing 
divination, but the other four are of varying utility for the other 
classes.

Splendid One
