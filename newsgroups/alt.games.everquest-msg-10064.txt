No kidding, talk about rude druids. There are soo many wide open areas
that no one uses that you can go to and kite to your hearts content.
Kiting near populated areas is just rude. Or do you rely on the forced
kindness of others to save your butt when you bite off more than you
can chew? I'd be willing to bet you are one of those wonderful people
that keep pulling half dead mobs to places like the tunnel to force
others to powerlevel you by killing your half dead mob.
