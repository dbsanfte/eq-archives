Hi:

I'm seeking some advice as to how to correctly calculate my mana
regeneration. My level 60 Wizard has just slightly under 4K mana, so for the
sake of the discussion let's say it's 4K.

Currently, I have what *I* think is twelve mana regen per tick. This is made
up from the following: My Greater Familiar gives me four per tick, Slime
Boots gives me three, Solstice Earring gives me one, Manaskin gives me one,
and Harvest gives me 301 mana for one point to cast, therefore 300 mana
regeneration, this can be cast once every ten minutes, so I'm assuming that
this equates to three per tick?

Okay, to my calculation: Am I correct in using this formula in order to
calculate how long it will take me to recover to *full* mana (4K) from
*zero* mana? As I think I have twelve regen per tick my formula is: (4,000
/12)/60. Therefore it should take me 5.5 minutes to regain full mana from
zero mana?

I've done some experiments in-game and am totally stumped as to why it's
taking me ten minutes and fifteen seconds (not casting Harvest) but wearing
KEI.

Without KEI it's taking me eleven minute and nines seconds to go from zero
to full mana, but I *am* casting Harvest (twice) during this example.

Mana regeneration is very important to all casters, and I'm trying to assess
the best way to invest my AA points. I have spell casting fury mastery (two)
but would love cut my down-time (and save cash from KEI purchases) by
getting a better rate of mana regen. Thing is, will Mental Clarity (three)
make a *huge* difference to me?

I'm rather stumped here. Yes, I *am* sitting during meditation and no I'm
neither hungry nor thirsty.

 Thank in advance to all that answer.

Stevie.
