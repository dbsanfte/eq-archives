My cleric has recently reached 34 and I'm wondering where to hunt.  I have
tried Rathe Mtns (for the loot of HG's) and couldn't find a group), tried GD
and that worked for a bit, but seemed slow and tedious and also having
trouble finding a group.  I just got out of HHK and tired of that place as
nice as it has been for the last 10 or so levels.  I'm thinking about trying
out Dawnshroud, but just wondering where you folks would suggest I go.  I'm
not twinked that much (180 Wisdom at this point) so I would love a place
that I can start getting some loot/plat so I can buy some better gear, and
experience is actually less important to me at this point.  My one fear is I
will get to a point where because of level I have to fight at a certain
place, but lack the AC and Wisdom to deal with the zone.  Any advice, as
always, is appreciated.
