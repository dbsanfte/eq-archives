While seperating the two casts with a chat line helps, I hard code in
a three tenths of a second pause between cast lines to get around
fizzles, any less than this and I've found the system often tries the
second cast before its decided the first one isn't working, so I get
"you can't cast that now" and then "fizzle"  Three  tenths of a second
isn't long at all, only happens when you fizzle first time, and works
every every time... two tenths works most times, one tenth works
sometimes... but never seen three tenths fail.

I don't like hard coding in the delay times like you have there, although
on a cycle time that short its probably necessary.  When I have
to do so, I often make a second CHeal chain hotkey that doesn't have
the delay built in, but I never overwrite my generic CHeal hotkey with
either of them.  Can't tell you how often I've seen a cleric decide to
CHeal a target other than the MT, say a mod mage between fights,
using his Chain button.  Its sloppy, and in some cases (healing a SA
who is off tanking an add, for example) can really screw people up.

Time to set up hotkeys isn't something they should be denying you,
just ask for it in the cleric channel and one of the more experienced
clerics should make sure the word goes to the raid leader, if you are
too shy to bother him.

With a manually timed chain, you can easily adjust timing on the fly.  On
the other hand when its as tight as a 4 second chain, accuracy is better than
adjustability.  Adjusting time shorter means the MA is getting hit too hard,
which means with it hard coded long you are in trouble.  Adjusting to longer
is merely a mana saving device, unless you are fighting something that
is going to take ALL your mana, its just a convenience, usually after killing
a boss mob there's plenty of time to med back to full anyway.

This is where the short healers are supposed to ride you over the bump.  LOH,
Superior heals, anything thrown into the gap might have gotten you over
the hump... but often nothing will, because communication about a glitch like
that is rarely fast enough.

Mod rods should be placed away from anyone but the dropping mage and
the waiting clerics.  They aren't toys to help casters KS mobs, they are
the lifeblood mana supply to keep the MT alive

Its true, healing anyone but the MA is a luxury, thats what all the other
healers
in the raid are for.  Still, I've learned to do some of this if the CHeal
rotation isn't particularly tight and mana doesn't look like it will be a
problem,
its nice to throw out a group heal and keep my 6 alive... group heals
don't require that I switch target off the main tank.  Sure do chew up
mana, though, so if thats an issue you can't afford this plan.

Something to watch for using mod rods is low hp aggro, at least once
times I managed to turn a "wow this is going to be close" into a wipe
by taking one more hit on a mod rod and pulling the mob off the MT
(ok, he wasn't really MT, by this point every warrior, SK and pally
was dead and we had a monk as target) and onto me, whereupon
I died instantly and there wasn't enough healing left over to finish the
"sliver of life left" mob off, particularly as he started picking targets
at random before the monk managed to grab aggro again.  In retrospect
I probably had enough mana to do the job, or could have healed
myself at least a remedy worth before hitting rod...
