I went on my first ever larger raid on Wednesday (The Hole). The
people arranging it considered canceling, but decided that some might
need the raid for escapism purposes and so they just canceled the
signup list and told people to just show up if they wanted to go. 

Somewhere between 25 and 30 of us did show up. There was one wizard
present, and I was the only druid, and we were in the same group...
Result? My group got experience for roughly half the mobs, even at
times when we were only accompanied by a shaman and a ranger ;)

It was great fun, we were joking and laughing and not talking much
about what had happened except when one of the enchanters had to leave
due to a barrage of phone calls about a reputed bomb threat. We did
the ranger epic mob twice and got all the way to the paladin epic mob,
but had to break up before the shaman epic mob since the wizard had to
leave. And of course, as I was setting up to port 5 of the tanks out,
a wanderer spawned, took a dislike to the druid with her nose in the
spellbook memorizing Circle of Commons, and promptly killed her :)
I was lucky in that the 58 cleric hadn't left yet; he rezzed me back
just before leaving. We were my group of 6 and two gate capable people
sitting in the deepest corner of the Hole waiting for me to get 300
mana for the port - quite an interesting way to end the evening!

I didn't win any withered leather, but I got quite a chunk of
experience and had *much* more fun than when I am hunting normally.
And that zone is just gorgeous to boot...
