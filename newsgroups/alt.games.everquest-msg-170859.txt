  Lenny ogre Chr is level 37 have cha of 1 (can not make it lower lol )
and I 
  cam still train my oger in the warrior guild in the Dwarf City. there 
  seems to be a cutoff were prices seem to not go lowere allso 

  Cha notes 
  Any city that has peaple that start with Low Char have a better
selling base
  Trolls Ogre Dwarf all have a low start Chr in there own home citys
sell 
  for the same price as the elfs with a higher Cha in the elf Home city
and 
  is offset bye the fact A elf going to a dwarf city is at best Dubius
or the
  troll or Oger City will be eaten. being A oger and Amb in both elf and
Dwarf 
  city I can SEE the price change. the 2 best places for me to sell is
my home 
  city or the dwarf city. But then I have My Wifes Teapray buy and sell
Sell the 
  big stuff for me. 

                              Lenny
