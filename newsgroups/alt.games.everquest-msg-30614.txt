Three teens held in attack Robbery, hate crime alleged in assault on
downtown waitress; Racial motive suspected; Incident is fourth in area
committed by adolescent group=20

Three black teen-agers have been charged with armed robbery and a hate
crime in an attack that left a white Annapolis waitress in need of plastic
surgery while raising concerns about the safety of the city's downtown
business district, police said yesterday.=20

Tacarra Tyler, 17, of the 1300 block of Colony Drive was charged as an
adult with armed robbery, robbery, first- and second-degree assault, felony=

theft and possession of a deadly weapon with intent to injure after a
waitress was attacked and hit in the face with a rock July 21.=20
=20
Tyler also was charged with violating a law against racial or religious
harassment, police said.=20

A girl and boy, both 14 and from Annapolis, were charged as juveniles in
the incident. Police did not release their names yesterday because of their=

age.=20

Tyler was being held without bail at the Anne Arundel County Detention
Center on Jennifer Road, authorities said. The boy was being held in a
juvenile detention center in Prince George's County. The girl was being
held at Annapolis police headquarters.=20

Annapolis police spokesman Officer Eric E. Crane said other teens also were=

involved in the attack and that police expect to make "one or two" more
arrests soon.=20

Police said Tyler led the attack on McGarvey's Saloon waitress Tracy
VanDagna, who was walking to her car near Duke of Gloucester Street about
11:30 p.m. when she was beaten and robbed. Police said a man struck
VanDagna in the face with a rock, knocking her to the ground, then grabbed
the 22-year-old waitress' hair and pulled her head back while a boy ran up
and repeatedly kicked her in the face.=20

The assailants then took VanDagna's backpack, which contained her wallet,
several hundred dollars in tips and a $600 pair of earrings, and fled,
police said.=20

VanDagna suffered a broken nose, which required plastic surgery to repair,
and needed five stitches to close a cut on her hand, police said.=20

Police said that after VanDagna turned over her backpack, the teen-agers
continued to attack her. A witness told investigators that the assailants
said they "beat up whites and Mexicans" because they don't like them,
according to police.=20

VanDagna is white; the suspects are black.=20

"It appears to be racially motivated," said Crane. "Robbery was the not the=

main motive. They had specific targets in mind." In a similar incident two
days before the waitress was attacked, a Hispanic man was assaulted by
eight to 10 teen-agers near Farmers Bank of Maryland on Main Street, police=

said. That assault remains under investigation.=20

The assault on VanDagna, the latest of four attacks by a group in Annapolis=

from mid-June to late July, raised concern among downtown merchants and
residents about safety near Main Street.=20

Police said they increased patrols of the downtown area in the wake of the
attacks and emphasized that the roving group of teens "is not an organized
gang." "In business, there are always concerns for people's safety, whether=

it's retail or people leaving their place of employment at 2 or 3 in the
morning," said Steve Samaras, past president of the Annapolis Business
Association. He said the recent string of attacks was unusual for the area
and added, "Hopefully, they got the right people."=20

This is not a new revelation. Blacks are the foremost perpetrators of "hate=

crimes". 30,000 White women are raped by black males every year. Over 5,000=

Whites are assaulted just as occurred in the above crime every year,
usually with more severe injuries. 1,800 Whites are murdered by blacks
every year.
