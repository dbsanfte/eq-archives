Most bows have level restrictions,you just have to live with it,its
not a big deal since you really dont want to rely on bow damge
for xping.Just look for the bow with the best stats,and forget
ratio until you are high in the fifties.
I tried some ulthork warriors in EW with my 45 ranger,needed 60 to 80
arrows in the average with compund-steel-shaft bow,170 Dex and
150 archery skill.

There is a quest in Seru,involving killing a npc in Katta,pretty easy 
at level 45,which gives you a jeweled encrusted quiver (sp?).
Rumour has it,that the weight reduction on a quiver is equal 
to the haste it gives;with the jeweled quiver,one should get 35 pct
haste,but I do not notice any difference.

Haste buffs and items dont affect how fast you shoot,only quiver will
do.
Dex determines damage of bows,so you can forget attack for that.

never saw it happen(Ranger 46 now).

Right,only criticals in archery.Right now my ranger crits for 61 at
lvvl 46,laughable compared to melee damage output,if you ask me.

I see no difference in damage,bow kiting with snare or rooted mob,or
when I shoot mobs from a distance,while mob is engaged in melee.

Thats my favourite )
I can onyl speak of my personal experience,but my ranger 46 just tanks
fine in DL,when there is no real tank available(War,Pal,SK).
Had several lengthy seessions in DL with me as a maintank,and never
had complaints from the healers,admitted I am pretty heavy twinked -
around 900 ac and attack unbuffed,1700 hps.

I really love my ranger,stripped my warrior off all valuable gear
lately and play him fulltime now.
Ranger gets a lot of toys to play around with,item and spell wise,
could be frustrating sometimes swapping around gear for effects
and switching spells constantly.

One last tip,dont miss Stonebrunt mountains when you are around
30,great xp and money from all those nice tigers and leopards,who
drop 2 cat pelts pretty often,and dont miss the heretic invader quest
for a haste belt,which easily sells for 1k in Bazaar,if you dont need
it for your self.
