Yep - anything with a high recommended level has high value - 
the architects scepter I won the other day was worth over 24k
TP.

At a rate of 15 to 20 TP to the PP I can be persuaded to use
those buffs.  Much below that and I probably won't.  I bought
tons of junk weapons in the bazaar today and average 70TP/PP
ratio - but I think prices on that stuff will climb.

I'm curious to see what this will do to the lower end economy -
if modestly good weapons are suddenly worth more as tribute, then
prices will climb on them until it reaches whatever the TP/PP
equilibrium is.  While this will hurt lowbies (they are harder
to buy) it will also help them (they can get more cash by selling
junk loot to high levels).

I'm not sure how much cash it will take out of the game, and it
will take items out of the game, leading to higher prices (supply
drops, demand climbs -> prices climb).
