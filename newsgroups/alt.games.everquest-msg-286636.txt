I have no doubt that if they had designed appropriate testing
methodology into their servers and their development practices
in general from the get-go, the savings would be as you suggest.
The savings would probably even have manifested during the
initial design and release, because I agree that building a
system with proper testing built-in does indeed make it possible
to save enormous amounts of bug-hunting later.

I also have little doubt (though more than none) that EQ's
original design and development did NOT include such tools.
Even though they may have been known practice as far back as,
oh, I think you've claimed 1995, they were hardly universal
then, let alone today.  Lots of systems are designed without
taking the time to include any way to do the sorts of testing
that you keep harping on.  Those systems are instead tested by
"trying them out and observing the results".  Usually, such tests
involve fairly controlled cases where the expected results are
easy to verify.  Those tests rarely cover all the possible cases
of a large and complex system.  That means bugs go undetected
until the user base finds them.  That's bad, but it happens.
It doesn't mean there was "no testing".  It may mean there was
shoddy or very limited testing, but to keep claiming there is
"no testing" just means you've got a very narrow view of what
"testing" means.

None of us are claiming that Sony adequately tests their code.
All we're claiming is that they do SOME amount of something that
MOST of us are prepared to include under the broad term "testing".

Oh, and the other thing about building test tools into the design
and implementation of a system?  It's a HECK of a lot more efficient
to do it from the start.  Going back to a piece of software that's
evolved for nearly a decade under a shifting design team, and trying
to ADD such testing methodology after the fact, is a LOT harder.
Sure, it might eventually pay off before the game dies of old age.
But I don't really fault them for not putting in the effort to do it.

I agree, that's not what "testing" means.  But frankly, having a
7-year-old run around PoK for 20 minutes IS one (very limited) form
of testing.  If they did that, I would not say that they did "no"
testing.  I'd say they didn't do nearly ENOUGH testing.  And indeed,
though I'm sure they do more than 20 minutes of kiddie rampage, I
still don't think they do ENOUGH testing.  But whatever they do, I
wouldn't call it "no testing".  But you apparently would.  Fine.
Enjoy your personal lexicon.  Can we discuss something else now?
