Twelve hours and 22 minutes of camping, one death and one near death, and
the Lord finally decided to show up.

The death occurred on break-in, with a couple low level friends, when we
accidentally popped the king room into the middle of our lord room battle...
I hadn't realized just how low level the druid was until, after killing five
goblins,
I resignedly called for evac and he replied "too low.."  the lad was only
28!  If I'd been paying attention we could all have walked out with them beating

on our backs, but by now we were all three too LOM and HP both to do
that, I had him gate out, the necro tried to get FD off, while I used an AOE
to draw the remaining eyes to me... well, gate worked, FD didn't, and
we had to recover two bodies... which the little druid managed while the necro
and I walked back.

The near death occurred when I first tried to solo the room.  Took me long
enough that the broken room didn't stay broken, I had all three up and
on me.  Was unable to switch my pet off the initial target, something was
backstabbing me, and the shaman kept healing my target....which I stupidly
kept on, sure that the next big nuke would finish it off.  When I finally
decided
to gate, I actually fell unconcious while casting, and Death Pact stood me
back up, I channeled the spell thru death, and gated out.  I had also been
poisoned, only the fact that buffs strip if you are lower in HP than your
unbuffed state would permit you to live thru saved me from dying on
arrival.  Its so vanishingly rare that I use Death Pact that this has to be the
first time I've ever had it work!

Eventually I did figure out how to solo the room and the king room as well,
with the pet and Upheaval its quite possible to daisy chain thru quite a stack
of the little greenies, as long as you are prepared to sit for a long regen
spell afterwards... just have to be sure and eliminate or stun the healers first

and foremost.

However, I spent most of the day in the company of a 57 rogue, and later
added in a 54 monk, we were literally killing every goblin in the dungeon,
and making the rounds of some of the gnome PH as well.  I walked out
of there with over 30 points of fire resist gear to wear in AOE mob raids,
and a 75% weight reduction box, my friends had a similar pile of goodies
as well.

Then I went on a successful Faydedar raid and picked up my orb and second
shell at the same time, happy coincedence, epic errand and a tryout for
all that fire resist gear in the bargain!
