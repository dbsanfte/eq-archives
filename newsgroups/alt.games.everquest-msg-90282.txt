I play on Rodcet Nife server and was wondering if there are any guilds with
predominately UK or European players. I have nothing against US players but
they are 6 to 8 hours behind me. This means that during the week when I play
after work in the evenings only a few are online, and by the time most of
them get on it is getting late. Ie. someone on the east coast gets in from
school at 5 o'clock their time and starts playing, it is already 11pm for
me.
For general grouping and fighting it is not a prob, but for doing raids, or
getting a high level group together to do special tasks such as the Velious
quest armour, I am on my own. I have missed several guild events simply
because they started at 5 or 6 am my time.
I dont expect the guild to drop everything for me, but I would like a guild
with high level chars that play when I do.

BTW I am now a lvl 51 warrior.
