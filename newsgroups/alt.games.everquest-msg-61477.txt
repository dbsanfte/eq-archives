Is it possible to move a character from one account to the next and
remain on the same server?  I made an alt on my wife's account.  I
didn't know it would grow to become my main.  Problem I have now is my
wife has started to become more interested and wants to play more,
which means I can't play my new main while she's playing, so... can I
move my new main to my account and if so how?  Any help would be very
much appreciated.
