	At 30 you are viable as main tank for your group, easily.  Outdoors, you
should be pulling.  Indoors, it is usually better to let a Monk split things,
unless you can get singles by virtue of level.

	At 40+ Rangers are less viable as main tanks, unless well-equipped.  At
level 60 I have 1038 AC self-buffed these days and can tank for experience
groups just fine.  On raids, you're a damage dealer: get behind the mob and
help beat it to death.  At 55-59 you should make sure you have a good bow and
be prepared to Trueshot raid mobs; at 60 you may be asked to melee instead so
you have Weaponshield available.
