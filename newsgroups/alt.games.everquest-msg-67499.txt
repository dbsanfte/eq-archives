    I had the problem, so I can elaborate. You'd run the patcher. Patcher
would hang badly, so you'd cancel out somehow (I did Ctrl-Alt-Del and nuked
it by hand). What you wouldn't notice is that the patcher had started
another process in the background that wouldn't stop and slowed my computer
to a snail's pace. Did another Ctrl-Alt-Del, saw another process called
"Everquest", killed that, got my computer back. When I don't have anything
concerning EQ on my screen I sure wouldn't consider my computer to be
"running EQ". Just a terminology thing.
