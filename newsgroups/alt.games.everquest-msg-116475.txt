I"m not quite following your question, so I'll reframe the example a little

Assume at death you had 1000 xp, and lost 100 xp on dying

Then you get a 96% rez.

Total xp now 996

you get 4 more xp, and die again (once more at 1000xp total, once again
losing 100xp)

then you kill things to get 10 more exp points while waiting for your 96% rez
total now is 910

then you get your 96% rez.  This restores 96% of your lost xp due to the death,

or exactly 96xp just as before... so your new total is 1006xp

I have literally died while almost at level, gone on to get a fair amount of xp
in
while working my way back to my body, rezed myself, and dinged.  The xp
I gained while working back in overcame not only my 10% loss (I was just 49
at the time) but also whatever the remaining distance I had to cover before
leveling was.

If you are die and don't have a rez handy immediately, loot all but one item
on your body (personally I carry blessed water in my range slot for the
purpose)
and go back to getting exp.  Even if you do have a rez handy, you might as
well use up the mana and HP you have before getting rez, you are going to
lose almost all HP and -all- mana anyway.
