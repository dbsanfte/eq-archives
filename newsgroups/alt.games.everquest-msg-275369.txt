    Some people in The New Bazaar were saying how happy they were that the 
lag was gone. For every one of them, though, there were three or four who 
hated it for various reasons: takes forever to visit traders, the Find 
function is a lot screwier, people were logging into the old Bazaar area 
(new Bazaar was built on top of the old one), the Bazaar and Barter areas 
were kept separate, there's no longer a big PVP arena in The Bazaar, etc. I 
don't like it because it's separate from the Barter area, and because it 
takes much longer to purchase items. I knew enough to hit "Hide Traders" and 
look down when looking at the front of The Bazaar where all the non-traders 
hung out, so the lag didn't bother me.

    Oh, and none of the vendors can be found with the Find NPC function 
except for the Discord merchant. Wheeeee.
