Thicken mana is purchased in the Brownie town in LFay. I advise asking a 
druid with Wolf form to get it for you, since brownies do not aggro on wolf 
form. 

Levitate is in Druid guilds.

Your first big research spell (one my 18 chanter is still trying to find) 
is Mesmerization, and it requires Tasarin's Grimoire Page 26, which seems 
to drop MUCH less frequently than the other pages at this level.
