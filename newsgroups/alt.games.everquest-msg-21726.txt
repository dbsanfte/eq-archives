Are the best things.  I was suffering from constant and heavy lag last 
night so I gave up on the idea of fighting anything and headed to East 
Commons to try and find my Staff of Writhing (doesn't ANYBODY sell these 
things anymore? I asked for a price check, got "80-100PP", auctioned for 
hours, nobody said anything.  Couple of hours later some guy asks for a 
PC and I ask him if he has one to sell, he says yes, make an offer I say 
"120 PP" and a minute later he comes back with "I have another bidder".  
I said "I only have 130 PP so if he goes above that I'm out of luck." He 
came back with some extreme number in the 300 range and, well, I'd been 
saving for WEEKS to make that 130PP and it was all I had, so I was rather 
upset at having spent all that time waiting only to have it ripped out of 
my hands at the last moment :( anyway. Enough digression.)  I started 
hunting wisps to see if I couldn't get a few GLSs (mostly Lightstones - 
are these worth selling to PCs or might I just as well sell them to the 
vendors?) and then thought "oh heck I might as well try making that 
leather padding and see if I can't improve my tailoring" so started 
hunting bears and spiders.  All of a sudden...

"You have gained a level!  Welcome to level 17!"

Oh GOD.  After days and days of struggling to make 17, and always dying 
(who said nobody could spell dying? :p) and losing exp JUST before I 
dinged, it was like a gift from the gods.  If that bear had been carrying 
anything, I would have had it bronzed and kept it as a trophy :)
