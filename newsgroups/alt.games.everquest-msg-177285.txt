Baking is really cheap.  I made it all the way to 182 on around 100pp.  I
still need to max out on Patty Melts, but after making about 26 stacks of
them I called it quits.  Patty Melts max at 188.  If I had sold my Patty
Melts the overall cost would have been even less, but I hung on to them and
used them for food, distributed them among alts and gave them to friends,
and even so they lasted several months.

Tailoring is not really that expensive (pre Acrylia) but it does require a
lot of time to farm components if you don't want to buy them.  I skilled up
using Crystalline Silk, and that's where I spent the most money, but it was
very easy and fast.  I moved on to Wu's and thats where things got
complicated because I needed the Viscous Mana.  My daughter had a chanter
already started so I levelled her to 12 and made my own.  If you have to buy
it in the bazaar it's about 10-15pp each.  I farmed silks early one morning
in EK for about 4 hours and got enough silk for 8 stacks of silk swatches.

The good thing about tailoring though is that you can make items at a
reletively low level that sell well in the bazaar for other tradeskills, or
for other people skilling up tailoring that don't want to farm.  I maxed out
on Wu's using about 3 and a half stacks of swatches and sold the rest in the
bazaar for 10pp ea so I made back about 800pp on tailoring.  I also farmed a
lot of pelts while I was gathering silk and I skinned them down and made
leather padding which I sold for 15pp ea.

Brewing is another cheap skill and you can skill up making stuff that other
tradeskillers need.  Heady Kiola is needed for tailoring Wu's (and LOTS of
it) it's really cheap, so even selling it for a couple plat each in the
bazaar will make back your brewing investment.  The next one is Paella Bark
Tannin, which is used for Acrylia tailored items.  I think trivial is around
110 for this one.

Smithing-can't offer much adivce here.  It's the one I'm working on now and
I'm stuck at 111.  Getting to 111 was pretty cheap, but from here it gets
pretty pricy.

Pottery is also really cheap and easy to skill up.  I'm at around 140 and I
got there on unfired bowls and ceramic linings.
