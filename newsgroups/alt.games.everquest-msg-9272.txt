My girlfriend is a brewer, although as I don't drink beer or ale I have to rely
on the reports of others as to the quality.  I'm bookmarking bizbees webpage
for her in case there are resources there she needs.

One problem with living with her being a brewer, we have huge quantities of
glassware cluttering up the house and garage.

Him.
