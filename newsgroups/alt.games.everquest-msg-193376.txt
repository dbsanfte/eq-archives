<<<BBUZZZZZ>>> Wrong answer

Look up the total sales figures for WC3 or SC. Now go browse the game
matching services and see how many people are playing online on
average at any given time. You will only find a small percentage
compared to total sales. Even taking into account time zones and other
factors, you still cannot come up with a "majority" only playing
online.

Now you might be able to say that the majority have played them
online, but that is not the same as "only" playing them online.
