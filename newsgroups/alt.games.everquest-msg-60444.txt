Yeah..good luck...his regen rate is incredible :-).

I used a Blackjack to train my 1hb on him.  7/21.
Damage isn't the best, but 21 is a fast enough delay
to get in a good training session before zoning out.
Cost me 200 pp, which is fine for a training weapon.

If you're a lot richer than I am, try an Iksar Berserker
club from Kurn's.  7/18.  Same damage, better
delay.  More hits before zoning.  Cost around
2K on my server, which I wouldn't spend just to
train with.

Again, I seriously doubt you'd have to worry about
killing him.  He regens like Cazel.  but he hits slow
and not that hard.  My rogue would usually pull him
to the zone with a thrown weapon/run away fast
combo, and melee him down to about 1/2 life (my own,
using a failing 1hb skill and a bare fist off-hand,
I barely touched him for the longest time :-)  ), and then
zone.  Bind wounds to 1/2, sit at the zone until healed
(do other things), then head back to N. FP to train
some more.
