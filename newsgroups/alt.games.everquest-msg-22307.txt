Hi ...

I have cause to make a complaint about a player belonging to a Guild in
EverQuest. This player belongs to the 'Talons of Cazic Thule' Guild and I
need some assistance in locating the name of the Guild leader. As I'm
relatively new to EQ I'm not sure how to locate this person .. So all help
in this matter would be very much appreciated.

Many thanks for your time ...

Stevie.
