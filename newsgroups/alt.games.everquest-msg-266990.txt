Clerics get the best straight-up heals, and are the only class to get
reverse damage shields.  Shamen get wards (damage absorbers) and slows.
Druids get regens and better DDs.

It's unclear whether any of them are far more powerful than the others in the
mid-high game, but I'd guess they're all viable in small groups, with an edge
to shamen for the slow, while clerics stack better in raids.

In beta, I picked Shaman for my Gnome, on the theory that spirits are just
another type of machine to manipulate.  RP seems the best reason by far to
pick a class.  Haven't played since release, EQ1 still has me :)
