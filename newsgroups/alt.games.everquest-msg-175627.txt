Not quite.  You can't lose your Force sensitivity so if you lose Jedi status
you're not really all the way back at the beginning.  You just have to
figure out how to become a Padawan and train, train, train till you're a
Jedi again.  Then if you lose it you have to figure out how to become a
Padawan yet again (they've implied the process for becoming a Padawan is
similar to the process of becoming Force-Sensitive).

This I don't know.  All I know is what the developers say, and besides
telling us that it's hard to stay Jedi they're not talking.

The idea that only players who really want to will be Jedi.  And I don't get
the impression it'll be in the form of "busy work".  I get the impression
it'll be just that there are a hell of a lot of things Jedi (or Dark Jedi,
if that's what you are) are *not* supposed to do.  And if you do any of
those things you get kicked from the order.  I don't know for sure that
that's the way it will work though.

That's part of the reason it's going to be hard to be a Jedi -- while in
1-on-1 combat they're extremely hard to kill, a lot of people have already
announced their intentions of being Jedi-hunters... so between Darth Vader
and the PC Jedi-hunters ganging up on you, you're really going to have to
stay on your toes.  Also I get the impression that Jedis are permanently
PvP-flagged, even if the prospective Jedi-hunter is *not* PvP-flagged.  I
don't know this for sure but that's what it sounds like.  And if 4 or 5
well-equipped and highly skilled combatant players get together I'd say the
Jedi should probably be running unless he or she is pretty damn good.
