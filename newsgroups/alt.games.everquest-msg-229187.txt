LOL entertaining post, but I will address the above portion of it only as I
don't really like to think about what some people actually do while they are
sitting in PoK 'afk' staring at each other...  LOL

As for the mob gating, Oh yes, very possible and as you saw, very BAD when it
happens...  LOL

The only way to prevent that from happening is to keep the mob stunned or
mezzed to interrupt the spell just like they do to you when you try to cast.

As near as I can see, you did everything right, but shit happens.  :)  Take
heart in knowing that in most LDoN's I've done, the entire party wipe has never
happened until after the success.  LOL  My theory is, the group gets their
success and immediately becomes a bit more relaxed and a bit more careless. 
I'm NOT saying you were careless, but this is one of those chalk it up to shit
happens...  :)  

As you get higher up in levels, you will have more and more mobs that gate and
more and more mobs that will summon you to them because they are just too lazy
to come over to you and beat on you.  LOL  
We did a Kael raid recently and one of those bastages gated...  hehe  Raid
wipe.  

Take heart and Good Hunting!

Oh, and Happy Holidays!
