Looks like maybe its to update to Dx9.0c?  While I have that, it turns 
out I still fail the test, because updating automatically thru windows 
update doesn't include some .dll file thats apparantly necessary... to 
pass the test, although possibly for no other purpose.  Anyway, can I 
download just that file?  Nope, apparantly you have to go thru the 
manual route to install Dx9.0c.  Nice time waster there, eh?

Luckily at this point I'm on DSL instead of connecting via my cell phone 
so thats no big deal I guess, working on it.
