Ended up getting Dwarven Paladin.

1HS - Defiance
2HS - Arbitor's Combine Greatsword (since he already had it)
1HB - Centi Warhammer
2HB - Silver Etched Warhammer (250pp in baz)
Piercing - Centi Warspear
Shield - Sarnak Battle Shield

Bought mostly AC gear with either sta or str adjustments. DEX is over 
100 (about 110)... Approx. 750hp at lvl 13 (unbuffed but w/ equipment).

Most lavish piece of equipment bought that wasn't with dex/sta/str was 
waist slot which someone advised Sash of the Dragonborn. Will this help 
with getting skillups or was it a poor choice for a low lvl pally?

Thanks for your help,

Matt.
