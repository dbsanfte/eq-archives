I suppose if I solo'd or did pickup groups more, I'd probably have
bothered to go get that. But the fact is, I travel with a regular group,
none of whom is a porter, and only one of whom can gate. (And being a
goody goody, certainly woulnd't be bound in the OT outpost anyway.) So,
I've lived my trollish warrior life resigned to the knowledge that when
we are ready to move on, I'm either going to be lucky enough to have a
guild porter in the area to take us *all* to our new destination, or
we're just going to settle in for a nice long boat ride. But hey, that's
what language skills are for. ;-)
  In fact, last night, we were doing language skills *while* fighting
Seafuries. The fights are LONG, and a large part of the time the Cleric
and the wizard were just sitting there medding waiting for the
approriate time to be healing and snare/nuking. So I shut off group chat
and they spammed the group with languages. I think I just about mastered
Dragon and High Elf by the time we were done, and I've got an
intelligence of about four. 
  It was pretty funny to see the text scrolling by. :-)
You slash a Seafury Cyclops for 38 points
You slash a Seafury Cyclops for 19 points
A Seafury Cyclops hits YOU for 96 points!
You slash a Seafury Cyclops for 38 points
Your language skills have improved.
Huh? What am I learning? Cyclopsese?
