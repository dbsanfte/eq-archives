Last night had a friend nag me into going out to 
Stonebrunt and practicing while I played.  I didn't want 
to push my pitiful conjuration skills onto a pick-up 
group, but since he asked... :)  I only got I think 
*one* skill raise in the hour or two we were there, but 
it was a heck of a lot funner than sitting around 
casting the same thing over and over.  Gonna have to nag 
him into doing that again.
