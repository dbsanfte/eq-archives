As a player from Oz where every single patch happens smack bang in the
middle of my play time and normally results in complete loss of playtime for
2 nights (one for the patch and one for the patch-patch) I find a lot of the
current posts hilarious.

People from different timezones have been complaining about major downtime
for ages - and the only reply from the NG is "Don't like it: fuck off fag,
no-one invited you". Now whenever a little unexpected downtime occurs during
U.S prime time, we get a heap of the same weiners crying foul and generally
pissing and moaning.

Oh the irony *clutches sides* - yes, this is where I try to hold a straight
face just long enough to say:

        "If you don't like it, fuck off and stop playing: fags"

.....ahahaha...oh, my sides.....
