I'm well aware of the benefits of shammy's. He indicated (from what I got of
it anyway), that they may wind up with TWO shammys. The second shammy
becomes somewhat redundant except for heals. By converting the SECOND shammy
to be a druid instead, you pick up a few dots/nukes that are not necessarily
redundant with those of the shammy, and you still get the healer. 1st toon I
would take the shammy, but I would take a druid over a 2nd shammy. Idea was,
get a "similar" class for whoever wanted a shammy, while still adding more
benefit to the group.
