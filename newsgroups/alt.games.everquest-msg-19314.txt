Axe is good up until 20 when your dmg cap comes off, you should always keep
both 2hs and 1hs near if not maxed out, theres a reason the warrior epic can
be swapped back and forth!

A good 2hs weapon would be the Blackened alloy bastard sword out of the
revamped runnyeye, 24/39

or if you have more money to spend, A Mithril 2hander is very nice ( I use
one right now ), 21/40 with permanent haste of 30% ( makes it 30 or so
delay ) and it gets the 40+ delay damage bonus too ( puts the damage on par
with the BABS, but it has lower delay )

For 1h weapons, I recommend Velium Battle Axes, 8/28, my Blackened Alloy
longsword 10/29, Icetooth's claws 11/29 ( primary only )

Prices on my server are around 300-500 for BABS, 1k or so on mith 2h ( got
lucky with mine at 500 ), around 50pp each on velium battle axes ( or go
scavenge them up out of icewell keep in velious, maybe get some royal velium
frosted armor while youre there ) BALS around 200-300, and I'm not sure on
the claws, some guy traded me them for 2 smithed steel bonings ( WTF??? ),
yet another bit of uber luck.

BTW, feel free to debate me on some of these, this is just the stuff that
*I* have or have had in the past.
