I really need to give the tutorial a try.  That's one thing that I've liked
about other games that EQ didn't have is the hand-holding and little boost
you get from a set of coherent, impossible to avoid unless you *want* to,
set of newbie quests or tutorial, whatever.  Even the "hardcore" games,
Quake-like, have tutorials these days.  I'm glad they finally added one.

Beastlord is a good choice for a newbie.  =)
