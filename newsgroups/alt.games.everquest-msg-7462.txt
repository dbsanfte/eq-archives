Closest thing I have seen to this is a friend was getting gaps (missing
lines) in the text...these were actually Tell's. Not sure what had happened
but he had used a colour that was for some reason not recognised.
If this is similar to what you are experiencing try cut and pasting the text
colours from one of your other PC's eqclient.ini files to the one on the PC
that is having the trouble (eqclient.ini is found in you EQ dir)
If not, then I haven't a clue maybe a graphic driver issue but then it
sounds like all the PC's tested have the same Chipset for disply.
The options for Display driver is "Primary" which basically means D3D and
"Glide" which will only appear if you have a 3dfx card, I don't believe
anyone else makes a Glide compatible chipset.
