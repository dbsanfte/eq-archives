Just a few suggestions/possibilities as to what he means:

Logfile parser needs an "h" in front of the "ttp".
Under "Where to hunt" you need an "http" in front of the eqatlas link to
make it active.
Caster's Realm is listed twice under the general links.
EQMaps is listed twice as well.

That's about all I saw. Looks good otherwise! Good job!
