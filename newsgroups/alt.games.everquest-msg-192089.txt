Is it somehow tougher to raise a skill from 210 to 211 than it was to move it
from say, 100 to 101?  I'm asking because I'm almost a full bubble into my new
level and my meditate skill has gone up only one point from 210 to 211.  It
seems like I remember my med skill going up all five points the first time i
would sit down and med after a fight when I was a lower level.  I know that my
intelligence is higher than it's ever been so that really can't be a
contributing factor.
