I'm not sure from your post, but I'm guessing you may be new to the game and
playing your first character.  If this is the case, then I would not be too
concerned with the rate at which you reached level 4.  You are still deep into
the learning curve of the game mechanics and learning the lay of the land so to
speak.  My advice would be kill every creature you see that cons even or lower
to level fast.  At your level you should get exp off of anything.  To con just
right click on the creature to get a message of it's relative strength versus
your strength.  Also talk to NPCs in towns.  At low levels there are many
relatively simple quests that can be done for experience.

If I've totally miss guessed and you are not new to the game, the above advice
still applies.  One of the fastest ways I've found to level a new character is
through low level quests such as the bone chip quest in the Paladin Guild in
Kaladim.  You can do the quest over and over ad nauseum and level rather quickly
(couple hours) through level 7 or 8.  Just don't neglect your skills when you
level too fast.  Or else it will return to haunt you rather quickly.
