That is commonly the refrain of people who aren't willing to accept
the consequences of their own actions, and would rather blame others.

Funny, the FAg members who were publicly humiliated here by their news
service provider seemed to have remarkably thin skin following that
incident.

As for driving us to insanity, that's never happened. In that this is
a community about a game, we understand that it's inevitable that
ill-behaved children will often be disruptive here.

As you can see, and again as a couple of your FAg buddies can attest,
we have ways to deal with them. The include notifying service
providers of breaches of TOS, outright ridicule (richly deserved), and
kill files (my personal favorite).

The thing, you see, is that some of us actually *care* about the
quality of this newsgroup, and are willing to do what we can to
maintain that quality.

>If A.G.E. were a private news forum, I'd see things differently

I doubt that you would see things differently. You might *act*
differently, since you'd understand that you could be thrown out, but
if you consider it acceptable to act poorly in public, I see no reason
to believe that you would not consider acting poorly in private
equally acceptable.

Unless you're running a kill file (and I recall you claiming that you
don't), all of Zeppo's stalking posts are very probably available to
you. Take a look at them and explain if you find his actions even
remotely mature.

Ah, yes, I believe that would be the Straw Man that Bizbee mentioned.
As such, we'll just dismiss it for what it is.
