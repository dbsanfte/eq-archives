Before you do anything else....Are you running Texture Caching in EQ?

If so DELETE all *.TXC files in the EQ directory and let the game
rebuild the cache. If the textures were created/cachec with the old
video card/driver, that could be your problem.

If that doesn't fix it........

Need full system specs.(CPU, Motherboard, RAM, Operating System, DX
version).

A couple of quick suggestions.....

I. Reinstall DirectX from Microsoft. MS recently released a new
version of DX8.1 (called DX8.1b) for Win9x/Win2K (For WinXP you need
to load Service Pack 1 for WinXP to get the new DX8.1b)

www.microsoft.com/directx

II. COMPLETELY remove all existing video card drivers, and reload the
NVidia set..

1. Go into the Control Panel and under the ADD/REMOVE SOFTWARE icon
uninstall the NVidia Display Drivers (and any other drivers that may
be related to your old video card)

2. Once removed, it will prompt you to reboot....do so. 

3. When returning to windows, the NEW HARDWARE FOUND wizard will come
up and will tell you that it has found a new VGA card and will prompt
you for drivers. Hit CANCEL! 

4. Now, go to START - SEARCH - FOR FILES OR FOLDERS and do a search
for all files and folders using the filename NV*.INF
This search will normally give you 3 to 4 files found in your
c:/windows directory and subdirectories (including the Windows/System
directory). Select these files and erase them. Now go to your Recycle
Bin and Empty your bin. 

5. Next...time to go to your Registry. Go to START -- RUN -- regedit 

6.  Go to the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -- SOFTWARE section. Here you
should find an NVidia key (and possible one for your old video card).
Select it and delete it. 

7. Still in the registry, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER -- Software and
there you might find another NVidia key or one for your old video
card. Select it and erase it. Once all this is done, close the
registry. the registry is now clean. 

8. Close all windows and reboot. 

9. When in windows after the reboot the NEW HARDWARE FOUND WIZARD will
pop up again. Cancel that. Now find the new NVidia drivers that you
have downloaded and extracted and run the SETUP file. Once complete,
reboot and you are done. 


Good Luck!
