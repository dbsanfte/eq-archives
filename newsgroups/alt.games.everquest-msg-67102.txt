bah low frame rates. Im getting well over 2x the frame rate now, and it
looks heaps better. Engine wasnt doing just fine imo.
I like the rest of the package too, but when they make bazaar only zones in
Luclin (you want to trade? you gota buy luclin now), it really puts me off
Verant and Sony as a company.
