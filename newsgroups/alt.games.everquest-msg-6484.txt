I'm sure, (though if i'm wrong, someone will correct) that on Antonica the
East Commonlands is the place to go on your server. It seems that on most
servers this seems to be the spot, due to both good and evil characters
being able to go there without problems, and a nearby bank for both.  If you
are on Faydwer (sp?) then I would say Greater Fay.  Good luck.
