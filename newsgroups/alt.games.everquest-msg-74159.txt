I haven't spent much time here yet but there are many hallways with
teleporter ends to them.  There is and NPC standing at the end of the
hall and behind them is a rectangular panel.  The panel is a portal.
There are a few on the ground outside too that take you up to the wall
that surrounds the city.  I think this place will take a while to
figure out.
