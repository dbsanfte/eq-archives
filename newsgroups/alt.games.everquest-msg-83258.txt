Is it my imagination or is everquest losing its title as king of online
rpg's. All the gameing magazines are saying this and everquest is losing
subscribers. Well if it is dying then its there on fault releaseing Luclin
with all those bugs was stupid and they get what they deserve. By the way
there sure alot of developers that started with everquest quitting. Is this
a clue to the major problems with luclin.

Ding Dong the King is dead
