Some discussion in other forums since yesterday. It seems there are a
few cases which still cause pets to break mez, but it's not nearly as
common anymore. Most common are the mob being mezzed while the pet is
fighting it and the mob ripostes at the same time the mez hits. Also,
it seems that if you don't actually /pet back off after the mob is
mezzed, there's a chance the pet will still hold aggro on the mob. Not
sure on that, though. Also, the mob has the pet DOT'd. The pet
registers that it's still being damaged by the mob even after the mob
is mezzed and thus re-gains aggro. They certainly don't break it "all
the time" anymore, though.
