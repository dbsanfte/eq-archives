That is because auto follow sucks, don't use it. I guess you are
controlling two characters though so you have to =/

All regular running speed for characters is the same, unless they are
overloaded. Framerate might do something if its serious, I'd freeze in
easteren wastes for example and other people with MY sow on them would
pass me while I froze (graphics lag)

The only reason for levitate not to work here is so you get killed
along that ramp. As with the deathtrap in paineel with the hard to
impossible corpse recovery, I guess it just shows that verant really
is sadistic.

Exactly, What I do is make sure that I'm kind of hugging the wall and
moving forward against it whether going up or down.. and only doing a
few steps at a time. If you do use autofollow, turn it off. As auto
follow says when you turn it on its bad around cliffs. What auto
follow should say  is "AUTO FOLLOW SUCKS ASS AND WILL GET YOU KILLED
OR LAGGED BEHIND, NEVER USE IT."

Sadists, like I said. I can't even see any advantage levitate gives
you in that zone. Its also stripped in Sanctus seru.. which is weird
since there are no high places.

Hmm I'm kind of wondering if like in Shadow haven there is a tunnel
perhaps down in the water.... that goes somewhere. I'd hate to fall
off and die though.

yeah.
