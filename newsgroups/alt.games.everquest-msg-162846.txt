Supporting you - from the developer chat transcripts at Caster's Realm

Question-
The new NPC�s don�t seem to give that much experience even though they are 
red or yellow. 

Answer -
The color doesn�t mean too much. Once you are fighting mobs that are 10 
levels below you it�s obviously not going to be that rewarding, but if you 
are fighting mobs 2 levels above to around 4 or 5 levels below you, that�s 
your sweet spot. 


Seems to indicate that the bonus is figured on mob level relative too your
level.
