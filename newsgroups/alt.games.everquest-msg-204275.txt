Although I'm not sure it will work the way I want, I'm looking forward to
the new character "leveling" concept which hopefully breaks the strict mold
of spellcasters as magician, wizard, etc.  My biggest issue with EQ is the
static nature of spell increases that come with leveling characters.  At
level 5, you get a nuke, at level 65 you get that nuke times 100.  Allow the
player to have a little more input in whether he wants that level 5 nuke
times 100 or perhaps that nuke times 50 but with limited but reasonable
capabilities to heal or charm or buff.
