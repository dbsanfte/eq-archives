Ok, so an hour after the patch is supposed to be complete, my son tries 
to log in to EQ.  No joy.  I get home a half hour later, still no joy. 
No worries, I'll just bop over to the Sony site and make sure the 
servers are still being patched, rather than it being something on my 
end thats preventing me getting in.

Their site is being updated!

OK, I understand that too, updating the site is a necessary evil.

Its the timing I object to; during a server patch has to be one of the 
highest traffic times for the site, why on earth would you pick NOW to 
update it?

No, I don't think there's anything that can be done, its just your 
standard Vent post.
