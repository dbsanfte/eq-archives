Can somebody help me out on the timeline for the evolution of the RZtW
encounter? My knowledge of this history is pretty sketchy, but this is
the impression that I have thus far. (I'm sure at least Martin and
James, and probably a few others, can straighten out any points where
I'm wrong.)

1. Originally PoP is implemented and nobody is even near RZtW. For all
we know his loot table isn't even itemized. :-p

2. The first uberguilds on each server get to RZtW. They eventually
figure out how to beat him, and he's on some long respawn cycle. He's
only available once in a while on a known schedule, so it's easy for a
top dog guild to be on top of him at spawn time and maintain a
stranglehold on the bottleneck.

3. Enter Sony_Craptastic_Patch_Change_23894757683 and suddenly RZtW can
be up a hell of a lot more often. No guild can keep a capable killing
force online 24/7 for weeks on end keeping him permakilled. This leaves
opportunities open for Tier 2 guilds, and/or alliances of smaller guilds
to go take shots at him while Big_Dog_Guild_01 is napping.

4. (the big question mark) Is there another Craptastic_Patch_Change
where RZtW is returned to his original state of only being available
occasionally and can be permakilled by Big_Dog_Guild_01?

If this timeline is correct, I guess I would better understand the whole
fucked up Lotus Cult incident better if I knew just where in this
timeline all of the events in question took place.
