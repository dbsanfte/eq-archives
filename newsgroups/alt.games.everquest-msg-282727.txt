When initiially claimed, the bridle you get summons a brown warhorse
of the slowest speed (same speed as robo-boar claim and 9k buyable
mounts)

There is a quest you can do in bazaar that takes 2 minutes to do to
get a 2-slot container that you put in the /claim'ed bridle and
another bridle that you've bought in bazaar to combine to be a
warhorse of the speed and color of what you bought.  (The text of it
is that you're adding the barding to the horse you bought)

You can then put the combined bridle back in the container and combine
to split them up back to where they started.
