For what it's worth...

I was experiencing the same thing. Zoning/Camping would often revert my
facial features to default.

To fix it, I selected my preferred features, then played for a while using
'F9' (instead of the 'face' button) to verify that my features hadn't
changed. If I did use the 'face' button, I would hit 'cancel' instead of
'accept' if I was satisfied with the image.

That seemed to work. At some point my face stopped defaulting.
