Okay, hi all....
A question to you experts out there...
I am trying to do the Ave. Batt. Axe quest.  I got the letter in Kaladim for
the jailclerck in Highpass.  I turned it in, and went to see Bronin the
Halfling in misty thicket.  I ask about the Emerald Shard, and he offers it
to me for a favor....
Now, when I ask "what small favor?"  He just blows me off, says I'm no
friend of the Deeppockets.

What do I have to do to be a friend of deeppockets?  I though any dwarf
could do this quest regardless of faction...



Thanks,
