Nope, has nothing to do with loot distribution, but didn't deserve its own 
thread in my mind.  It has something to do with EQ, which is more than a 
bunch of the messages I have been seeing lately.  And, it is about the RNG, 
which was brought up in this thread.  Justification enough for me, if it 
were asked for.  The word "random" is even in the subject! =)

It relying on the "second" of the internal clock is exactly what I had 
always assumed by the skillups / successes I have seen since I started 
playing this game.  I think it also uses something else as a secondary 
seed, but I haven't figured out what, yet, and probably never will.  Maybe 
an actual real "random" number. As a programmer, I'm always thinking about 
the code behind the game when I play and this is one area that I honed in 
on early as being "bad."

The other day, we took down the Prince in Chardok and the 4 chanters rolled 
on the Epic piece.  The other 3 rolled BAM-BAM-BAM and all got around a 280 
on a 200-500.  I waited about 4 seconds deciding if I should even roll and 
got a mid-400 roll.  Doesn't prove anything, of course.  After I won the 
roll, I realized that the other 3 were further along in their epic than I 
was ( ie. they had all at least started it =), and offered it to the person 
who was the furthest.  Wow, what a mistake.  You'd think I would have 
learned from Monual's ill-decided roll to think before I roll.

If someone plans on starting breweing, get Kiolas to triviality and then 
get about 10 more points.  Then do the RNG test.  You can even sell the HKs 
for positive cash to players.
