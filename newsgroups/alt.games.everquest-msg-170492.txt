The one you really want to be sick to death of by the time you're through.

Skill+skill mod is capped at 255.  At 243, the geerlok gives you about 12 
points, so your chances don't get any higher past 243, it just becomes a 
status thing.

}> A related question is there any point to being a GM brewer except to make
}> a trophy?

There's a couple quests that involve brewing here and there, but 
seriously, the best reason is so you can turn up with obscure drinks at 
parties.  But you don't need to go much past 170 for that.  Bleeding 
Brain, anyone? :)

}> What other skills would people suggest as the best skill to take to 250?

All of them. :) Smithing can be good, depending on your race's cultural, 
but it is very hard and expensive to raise.  Tailoring is good but 
downright impossible.  Easy to raise skills you might as well do at some 
point when you're bored anyway.  Jewelcraft is no longer marketable.  If I 
had it to do over today, I wouldn't have picked JC again.

}trophies never trivial.  in fact, their trivial point is _well_ beyond the
}hard cap of the skill (talk to the people who fail 7x before successfully
}combining).

Well... Make sure you also talk to people like me, who got 2 trophies in 4 
tries. One of which failed on the pottery step making the seal.  Ouuuuch!

}each attempt costs upwards of 3k _just_ for the raw materials,
}assuming you can find all of them on vendors (2200 for the 8 velium bars,
}520 for the 4 rubies for the purified mana, 263pp for the blue diamond, 210
}for the diamond, 187 for the jacinth, 100something for the black sapphire),
}and then there's the inevitable donations you'll need to make to have the
}gems mounted by a jewelcrafter, a 49+ enchanter to cast the mana vial, and
}finally a grandmaster potter to create your artisan's seal (because really,
}would you want to give all that stuff to a potter who wasn't at least 200?)

Sure, that step trivials at less than 102.  According to the ol' success 
rate formula, you should hit the 95% success rate cap at about skill 150.  
But right there might be a good reason to consider GMing pottery as 
opposed to any other if you're only after the trophy.  Fairly cheap and 
easy to get to 199 at least with the new casserole dish recipe.  I haven't 
given much thought to post-199 yet though.  Any potters out there with 
suggestions?  I'm thinking probably ceramic bands.

(Note: I got 3 outta 4 artisan's seal combines at 168 skill.  Not a very 
large sample, so I'm calling it a run of bad luck. :) )

If you're considering the GM Brewing route though, consider that in the 
last step to make the trophy, you need a corking device.  That means not 
only another blue diamond per attempt, but you also have to hire a GM 
tinker to make it... Potters and bakers just need sculpting tools and 
dairy spoons, which are practically free.

}by the time it's all said and done, you could've lvl'd up, hunted down a +10
}INT/WIS/STR range slot item, and gathered enough plat to buy a tink bag or
}two.

Well, if you're a chanter, though, that +50 Cha is difficult to sneeze at.  
I'm so glad I got one before they became lore so I can have two. :)

}and once you have your trophy, and your skill, chances are the market on
}your server for that skill is completely saturated anyway.  it's taken my
}jewelcrafter over 3 months to make back the money required to get his skill
}to 250.

Hark! 'Tis the cry of the Disillusioned Tradeskiller!  Mind if I sing 
along? :)

Ahh, yep, you noticed that too. :) Pretty much the only thing I have that 
I would call 'uber'. :)
