LFay is not that bad really if you know what you are doing.  Firstly -
brownies are very rarely outside the north west part of the zone.  So long
as you never turn west from entering in at Gfay zone until you get below the
turnoff to the right one should rarely ever touch you unless it has been
pulled there.  Learnt this while killing the Nybright sisters for exp (great
exp between 11-15 btw).

Just follow the path south past that right turn a bit until it veers to the
left, then keep going South/Southwest until you hit zone wall, follow it
west until you come to a large rise over which is the DE camp.  Go north and
then northwest here to get to Rangers, then head southwest again and follow
wall to Nybright camp.  Also used for getting to Mistmoore.  A lot quicker
than taking the zone wall the way around, and I don't think I've ever been
killed by a brownie since only taking this route.
