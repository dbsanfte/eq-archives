First off, let me state, I have a 51 Iksar monk.  I'll break down the
advantages/disadvantages to Iksar as I see them:

Regen: From levels 5-50, negligible.  The first few levels, the regen is
really nice, after that point it's hardly noticeable.  51+, woo woo,
regen starts improving dramatically and is a nice asset.  Essentially
half of the game (if you end up playing to 60), regen does very little.
Human monks get Bind Wound, same as Iksar, which is essentially their
regen.

AC bonus: Unimportant, especially in the endgame.  By level 60, a measly
42 AC separates human monks from leezard monks.

Infravision: Very nice, but human monks can compensate with gear.

Swimming: Unimportant, both races can achieve the same Swim skill.  Not
only that, this is one of the *easiest* skills to skill up.  Iksar can
hold their breath longer, but if you're in a situation that's dependant
on how long you can hold your breath, you should be trying to find an
Enduring Breath item anyway.

Forage: Very nice, means you don't have to gimp back to town drained of
STA, out of food and water.

Shackle quests: Before Velious, a nice although semi-torturous series of
quests.  These days, with so much crazy gear floating about, not so much
worth the effort.  The wrist slot is always a hard one to fill, and
Humans have access to the very nice and easily available Vox bracer.
Note: these represent just about the only low-to-midhigh-level questing
you'll do that wont force you to do spend tons of time raising faction.

Faction: Sucks arse.  Velious was a breath of fresh air in this regard
since it presented an equal-opportunity environment, but Shadows of
Luclin has dragged Iksar back into the faction pit by being KOS to Katta
and Seru.

Epic: Hamstrung.  The first part of the epic requires two human monk
quested items that require an ungodly amount of faction raising for
Iksar to do.  The alternative was to kill the quest mob with 3-4 groups
of your closest 60th level friends, but this option has been nerfed by
VI.

Newbie zones: Field of Bone is one of the best newbie zones in the game,
followed closely by Kurn's Tower.  Kunark, in general is a great place
to hunt.  It's my favorite set of zones in all of EQ.

Fist damage: At level 25 humans hit faster than Iksar by 1 delay point.
Fairly insignificant, especially since both races do the same damage
with fists with their epic (see above) and there are a lot of 1hb and
2hb weapons to come by since and after Kunark.

An upside?  Since you get Feign Death, it doesn't matter who hates you
cause you can just play dead.

Sitting at level 51, watching my exp bar *crawl* along with each kill, I
don't think 20% penalty is at all worth it.  Not even close.  For the
small bonuses they plopped onto Iksar, they pretty much countered them
with horrible faction, which is more important than you might realize
(especially if this is your first character).  If they raised regen, AC
and forage skill cap, I could see possibly taking the hit.  As it is?
Pick a human.  Hands down, you'll get further and faster in the game
than you would with a leezard, and you won't be missing anything along
the way.
