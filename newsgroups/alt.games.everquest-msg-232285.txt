}I STILL have 2 batskull earrings on him (65 chanter). Ive been meaning
}to do the Solstice earring - just have to get off my ass and do it.
}Ive been spending most of my cash on my SK, that and saving up for
}Voice of Q (dang - thats a hard spell to find, when I DO see it up for
}sale, its at LEAST 70k). Been hoping to try and get that ruby earring
}that drops in SG.

Dohh... but there are so many good earrings!  I have solstice ear and Hoop 
of the Shai'Din from Chardok B (I love having see invis as a worn effect).  
I'm starting to work on the Seru earring quest, because I love a good 
quest. :)
 
}> Honestly, though, I recall having SS legs and not wearing them.  I can't 
}> remember for sure, but I think I had Hate legs that I liked better.  Now 
}> I've got some boring BoT drop I can't even remember the name of, but the 
}> stats are decent. :)
}Do you remember the mob they drop off of in BOT? I might try for
}those, since its one of the few zones I have access to that I have a
}chance at the runes for level 65 spells (not very pop-flagged at this
}time). Altho I hate the zone. Great AAXp but the trains are rediculous
}there.

Well, here they are:

I actually wasn't there when they dropped, so I can't say.  A friend was 
multiboxing whoever it was, and already had one on each of his toons, so 
he ran out and gave me a pair so he could loot again.  It's weird, at 
level 30 I'd love being twinked like that, but at level 65 it sort of 
feels like a bogus way to be getting loot.  Ie, it's not nearly as 
satisfying as spending hard-won dkp on something.  Kicks the crap outta SS 
pants though. :)

Hmm... the Hate pants were definitely not what I had and liked.  Those are 
worse than drakescale!
