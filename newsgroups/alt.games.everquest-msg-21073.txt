Just the other night I was hunting with my brand new 6th level druid (I 
finally decided to try one). 

I'm in WK and I stop into the merchant by the the zone to QH to sell. Much 
to my delight he had in stock no less than two HQ Bear Pelts. I quickly 
squandered my remaining cash (3pp) and purchased both.

Fifteen minutes later I'm heading back to SureFall 50pp richer to buy 
leather and spells.

I realize that to many people HQ Bear Pelts aren't a big find. But to an 
untwinked 6th level, that's a fortune.

It got me wondering, what's the greatest deal you've made from items bought 
from a merchant at pennies on the dollar?
