No, I'm a Tier'Dal enchanter, who happily worships Inny, and I had no
problem doing the quest many times, and I have not died a single time from
it. ;)
I've sold one stein for under 200, which was  a mistake.
I usually sell them for 200pp, and I'm sticking to that.. if someone offers
more, sure I'll take it, but I'm pretty dead-set on 200.. sure, vel has lots
of great stuff, but what can you get cheaply that is not NODROP that gives
not only +10int (which is a lot), but all the other stats?  Not much, if
anything at all.

I'm still not above doing the quest for someone if they need a stein.  If
you're on prexus, send me (Xaoalo) a tell, and I'll do the quest next time
I'm around or have a little free time. :)
