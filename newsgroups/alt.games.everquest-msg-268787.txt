You're being exceptionally dense. People join guilds for socializing,
unity, and so forth. A lot of people take pride in working together
with a guild and want to show their association off.

I can think of absolutely no good reason to restrict people from being
able to show their guild tag. A carrot is fine, but this is something
that should be part of the "basic package".
