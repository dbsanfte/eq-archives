Yup, DAOC did a lot of wrong things (IMO) but trade skills were one of the
"right" things.  I'm kinda on the fence about consignments* but the actual
"work" part of making stuff is a lot less painful, if no less boring.

*Consignments:  You go to your trade skill leader (NPC) and ask him for a
job.  He tells you that so&so (also in town) wants a particular item.  You
make the item, take it to the other NPC, give it to them, and make a small
profit.  As you gain in skill you get tougher consignments.  It's a way to
make money without having to deal with the auction channel.  It's too late
(I think) to add consignments but I think Verant could modify trades to be
more like DAOC in my first paragraph.
