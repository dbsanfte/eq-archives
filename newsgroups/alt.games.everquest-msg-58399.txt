Wait a few more levels then decide. At your present level I would tend to agree
with you but, later on you get some great DOT's,  DD roots and snares that last
ten minutes.  Generally, what tactic yuo use is situational -- depends on the
mob and the terrain you are hunting. Then of course if your WIS is sufficiently
high, you should start experimenting with quad kiting at around 35. (39 - 40 if
you are not quite so intrepid.)

Then there is the boring factor. When I'm bored I'll nuke. Sometimes I'll
Snare, root, Dot, DD med and read a bit with an eye on the screen.
