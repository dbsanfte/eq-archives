Just on that topic, just be aware that the forge currently can hit you for up to 80% of your hits in one blow, and that 
the tradeskill devices can decide you haven't hit the right key even if you have (i suspect latency because i live in 
sydney, but i can't prove it). A lot of people playing smiths end up avoiding the smith skill and using the geo skill 
wherever possible, because the damage is so much smaller and the cost of an extra fuel is worth not being regularly smited.

SOE has been informed that the forge is out of whack compared to every other tradeskill device and promises to do, well, 
sod all about it.
