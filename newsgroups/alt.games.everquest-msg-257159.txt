Well, don't Rangers do better with bows than any other class in EQ?  E.g.,
don't they have AA abilities related to archery that no other has?  So I'd
expect a lot of people playing Rangers to think that archery is what really
sets them apart from others, and is the best way they can distinguish
themselves.

Also, they are the best trackers.  While tracking doesn't inherently imply
archery, a ranged attack fits in really well with tracking.  With tracking,
you can find your opponent while the opponent has no idea where you are, and
then attack from a distance.  If you use tracking to find someone, and then
just run in and engage with a sword, you give away your position. :-)
