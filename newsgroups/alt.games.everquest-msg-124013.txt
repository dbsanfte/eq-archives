I have been playing a rogue since a while now and although it is a
great class, I find that many of his skills are totally useless.
Mainly disarm traps and pick locks. They really should add more locked
doors in the game.

The skill I am missing most of all however is the tracking skill. The
way I see the rogue, especially in PvP servers, is as a bounty
hunter/assisin. It would be great if they could track down their
victims with the tracking skill. I personally still don't understand
why a bard would get the tracking skill, he is a musician! I would
find it much more making sense if the rogue would get that skill.

Verant has been massively upgrading the casters. With the new pet
rules I surprise that not everyone is a necro or mage yet. But it
seems to me that Verant is forgetting to balance the non-magic classes
as they are "balancing" the casters upwards. 

Are there any Verant-officials in this group, I would like to hear
their responce.
