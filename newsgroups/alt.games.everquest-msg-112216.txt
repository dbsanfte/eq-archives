"You are completely off in the Twilight Zone on this issue"? Have a bit of
respect for other peoples' opinions.  A lot of us consider these "annoying"
things as a) part of the game to be tolerated and b) part of the enjoyment
of the game. In rl I cannot paint worth a damn so, if I need something
decent to hang on my wall, I have to rely on someone else to do it for me.
So, you can't bind? Tough luck. I can't wear the same protective gear as you
and, if my caster is crossing a zone and gets smacked, thats half my life
gone and I don't have a hope in hell's chance of escaping whereas your
meleer loses a bit of health and can escape. Also, from very low levels,
several different classes can heal you, some of them to full, immediately.
My caster is lucky to find someone to enhance their mana regen let alone
recover it totally. Not only that, you're sitting on top of mobs when they
drop and take first loot, whereas my caster is sitting at a distance and,
even when she does get a chance to loot, she doesn't like to because that
means wasting time recovering mana to help you ungrateful meleers, who won't
stop your damn pulling because it means youre losing loot time. Now, if they
want to fix anything in this game, forget everything else, this is what they
should damn well fix, looting!! Anyone within a group, with autosplit on,
gets the same share as everyone else who has autosplit on.  And, btw, like
most decent people on (any of) these servers, I do remember the people that
do me a service in the game and, I sure as hell, try and forget about the
greedy so-and-so's who thinks that everyone else owes them a living.
