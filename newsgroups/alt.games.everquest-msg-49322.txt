Just curious. Where did you come up with anything relating to "peer
pressure" in that post? I'm sure I'm misinterpreting you, so I thought
it best to ask. This was a decision I arrived at on my own, then checked
with the better half, found out we were both of a similar mind on this
one, and decided to take a break.

As I pointed out later in the post, reading books is only *one* of a
variety of non-eq activities which I very much enjoy, but I've let slip
away because I started playing *all* *the* *time* when I wasn't at work
or asleep. I also enjoy some televion, the theatre, or just working
outside in my shed. Yes, a pathetically simple little life, but I've
managed to enjoy it.

Yep. I know the type and have worked with a couple myself. I have the
good fortune, though, of currently working in a very small office with a
few co-workers, all of whom seem to share at least *some* of my
interests, and none of whom are the annoying, self-important,
holier-than-thou prig types you mention. The conversations we have alone
make it a great place to work.

Yep. Apparently was ready to give it up before I was, but had continued
for the same reason you mention. That we were doing *something*
together, as we always did before EQ, and that I was enjoying it. But we
both need a break to go do a bunch of the *other* stuff we enjoy doing
together. ;-)

Dat's da fact, Jack.
