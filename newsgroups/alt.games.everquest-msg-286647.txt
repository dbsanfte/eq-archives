	IMHO the two most important for a necro at that level are affliction
effiency and affliction haste.  Niether are terribly hard to get and can
be gotten from tribute.  Next in line is burning affliction, which has
become easy up to level IV but harder to find after that, and then the
affliction extension focii which are generally only available from higher-end
missions or other events.

	Summoning focii are basically useless, and spell haste doesn't 
stack with affliction haste. Mana pres is nice while you're buffing or if
you need to heal your pet. It's also useful if you tap tank.
