This refrain runs thru the entire discussion of AA, but I don't know what it
means.

If my regen ability was 4 before, a 25% increase is great.
If it was 100 before, a 1% increase is a total non starter.

How can I tell what my current (before) number to points (per tick, per
ability, per whatever) is?

This applies to almost all AA descriptions..
