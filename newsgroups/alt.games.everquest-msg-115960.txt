Ah that email address does not bode well! I am not disappointed by the
comments below. Must be another Troll Warrior...

Ignore my own guildies? That is a solution? I didn't pose that as a
problem. I can handle a boor, unless this response proves otherwise.
Why would I ignore a guildie when I am pledged to help them?

I am hardly sensitive. I wish I were. I would have a better time
ordering the coffee I like in a Starbucks. Usually they get frustrated
because I ask them when the coffee was brewed so I can get a fresh cup
of $3 coffee.

I am impatient with people being crass and rude on my dime. I am
impatient with the glorification of a bad preteen mentality on an
adult game. Adults are usually the biggest preteen offenders in the
game!

I am so happy you pointed out I am not perfect. If I were perfect, I
would be a lot richer and better looking. I would have graduated MIT
instead of my third tier school. I would probably be head of NASA, the
Pope and in charge of whatever conspiracy that really runs the world.

I hoped to find advice from people here who I see with good things to
add. Some people here actually have good advice, Ben, Dan, Biz,
Lokari, Tyger among others. I may think that they are all wet, but I
hear them and they have valid points even if I don't agree with them.

You on the other hand have little to offer me to the question asked.
You seem to have a problem with people complaining about acting
crudely. Perhaps someone complained about you, maybe someone told your
mommy you used a nasty word.

There is a small chance you are one of the people infesting our
society who believe that freedom means you can say "poopie" anywhere
you wish and people can't think you are a boor, because you have a God
given right to be crude?

<smacks forehead> What was I thinking! You are one of those small
people who get their prepubescent jollies out of flaming people on the
web. I must have had too much time on my hands, and typed out this
missive.

Perhaps now I will understand your point that now that I am not
guilded no one will group with me.
