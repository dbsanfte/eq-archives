No it's not a malaise but I don't want to derail this into my personal
ranting about EQ. I am just really really impressed with that flash
movie.

While I think any decent person will appreciate it for what it is
(they have a definate talent for that sort of movie, no doubt about
it), it's even more touching (I'm such a sap) for those of us who were
here at the beginning and know exactly what all those stills of the
original EQ cities mean, why they give the impression they do..
something someone from, say, Luclin or later may not quite understand
even while they do appreciate.
