Best advice is to start over as a better sk race such
as troll/ogre/iksar/dark elf. Erudin is about the weakest sk
race of all, as far as stamina or agility, while getting no real
bonus except high int (which ends up being semi moot for a hybrid)
Its also blind. 

I'm hoping you made agility at least 75 because if you did not you
will be a paper tank.

If you stick with this race get a shield of the stalwart seas ASAP.
Its availible in the bazaar on most servers for not all that much plat
(under 2k usually? ) It makes up for your lack of str and sta I think
and is erudin only. Outside of that I'd reccomend crustacean plate
which will make up for your lack of stamina/hp. Sentient armor or such
is crap, especially for an erud with already high int. Instead go for
crusty plate and a skull shaped barbute on your head (cheap as hell
and 35 hp) Move from the crusty plate up to higher AC/possibly with HP
in those same slots. I did not move from a crusty bp on my sk until I
could afford a barbed ringmail one (30 ac, 10 str, 50 hp) And only
went from the arms or legs to crystal chiten arms and the very
exceleently priced player made large acryllia plate legs. Generally if
you search in the bazaar slot by slot with AC/HP/shadowknight/erudin 
you'll get some great bargains. My troll did that and got shisshar
glvoes for 700 plat (great hp on those) and lodizal shell boots for
1600 (okay ac, great hp/ armor buff right clickable)

I'm playing a troll sk and have been amazed at the power of this
character from level 1 - 37. In spite of the 20 percent xp penalty
its soloed all that time and done quite well. My only wish from level
30 plus was that I'd chosen an ogre one instead since once you get
that 40 hp lifetap and up the regen is not such a big issue while the
ogres stamina which can easily be a base of 150 coupled with its not
being stunned from the front by melee makes it quite good.

Really race doesn't matter much outside of you not having much money
and your agil being below 75. Even agil of 74 is a HUGE dip in AC and
tanking ability. If you screwed up that way try to find a cheap ass
item which has good AC/possibly hp/sta and enough agil to move you to
75 at least. Don't go for blowing the bank on an agil item which
doesn't have any AC, its not worth it. Stuff like crusty plate and the
skull shaped barbute are your cheapest upgrades though. You'd not
believe how cheap this stuff is in the bazaar.
