I'm at just under 300 AA, I still have lots of useful AAs to buy before I 
even consider +resist or +stat AAs, like several hundred points worth 
yet.  I still have most of the OOW damage avoidance, improved crit 
affliction 2 and 3, a few more healing AAs, several to help with reducing 
interrupts, most of spell casting fury, spell casting subtlety (not sure 
yet on that), alchemy master 2 and 3, other tradeskill mastery AAs...  
That's off the top of my head anyway.
