I'm on Bellsouth too. But in Tennessee it's cheap.. well concidering if I
was paying for the ISP account, it would be more than DSL, but I work for my
ISP ^_^... but it's cheaper than any obtainable alternative.

Actually I find it rock solid, as long as power doesn't go down. Of course I
have $100 worth of line filters after losing 7(!) ISDN modems or Routers to
lightning in less than 18 months. And UPS's on the router, my computer, the
hub for my network....

But since they 'upgraded' the local switch, I lose link when the power goes
down AND the ISDN modem is unable to resync unless I physically
disconnect/cycle power. I think they left out the UPS at the switch. Idiots.
