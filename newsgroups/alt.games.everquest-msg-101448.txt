*sigh*

Let's cost this out guys.  Assume that money is going to pay for developers.  
I think the going rate for a hot shot developer in that are is, what, $100k 
a year?  [someone can get a better price and correct later]  Now the actual 
"cost" of the developer includes attendant overhead.  This includes VIs 
headquarters, servers, non-developer staff salaries, profit taken by Sony, 
benefits, SSI, and so on.  I think an overhead multiplier, given the nature 
of this business and its location, is at least 4.  This means each developer 
costs at a minimum $400,000 per year.  So, they have been hiring new staff 
developers and non-developers (Legends, Planes of Power, etc), bringing on 
new servers, creating new offerings, paying increasingly higher energy 
costs.  I would imagine that the requested increase is probably *quite* 
resonable if you look at the bottom line.  I sincerely doubt they are 
getting that much additional profit marhgin.
