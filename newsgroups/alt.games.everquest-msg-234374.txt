This is long, but bear with me. It's reasonably entertaining and good 
advice to someone who (like me) didn't know this could happen.

I was doing a Kael arena raid with my guild last night. Things were 
going reasonably well, with only one or two hairy fights...and then 
someone said "Look! There's Derakor the Vindicator!"

We were in reasonable shape health-and-manawise, so we pulled him. The 
fight was going encouragingly until Derakor, being the unsporting minion 
of Rallos Zek that he is, brought in two of his buddies (who were deep 
red to me at 53). My groupmates were only able to get the first two 
letters of "add" out before WHAM WHAM WHAM they were reduced to a fine 
red mist coating the walls of Kael. 

I used my handy Necromancer Pause Button(tm) (i.e., feign death) and was 
subsequently the only person to survive. The casualties went off to PoK 
to buy jade inlaid coffins for the corpse summonings, while I gated back 
to prepare. (Good thing, too--the second I stood back up, I could see 
Derakor and company off in the distance charging back in my direction. 
"We missed one!" I got gate off in time, fortunately.)

While I was sitting at the Eastern Wastes zone line, our cleric 
announced that he could only stick around for so long, and had time to 
resurrect one other person. No problem--one of the other group members 
offered to buy essence emeralds in the bazaar so I could use my brand-
new 93% rez spell.

A little while later, everyone showed up with the coffins. I only had 
one inventory slot free for them, so I had to grab them one at a time, 
cast Summon Corpse, and repeat. Everything was going smoothly until the 
guy with the essence emeralds handed them to me right before I cast 
Summon Corpse.

Guess what? Jade inlaid coffins are containers. I didn't know that. (No, 
I'd never summoned a corpse before, from level 39 all the way to 53. 
Never really had occasion to. What can I say? I ride the short bus to 
Norrath.) You know what else? The coffin I was using was in one of the 
topmost inventory slots. 

Go on...guess where the emeralds went. For extra credit, guess what 
happens when you cast a spell that destroys a container while there's 
stuff in the container. That's right--they went to the Big Bazaar in the 
Sky, and my guildmate was out a fair chunk of platinum. Arrgh. 

No one was really mad about it, and we managed to grab a passing cleric 
to get everyone resurrected, but still...I felt bad that it was the most 
expensive spell I ever cast. (On the up side, that one raid took me from 
apprehensive with the Coldain to amiable. I guess they're easily 
impressed.)

The moral here: Don't let sleep deprivation keep you from checking to 
see what items have gone where after a trade. Feh.

sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Really, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
