    If it's really just to level 60, it's a waste. But I bet the person
writing this forgot what the new level limit was, and it's actually to level
65. Anyone want to place bets on how brutal download times will be? You can
do the "bulk" of the downloads now, if you pre-order, but according to the
fine print:
Please be advised that we expect the final patch (on the live date) to
exceed 50 megabytes and, depending on your connection speed, may take you
several hours to download.

    Now this should be funny. Right now, because of faction problems,
Illusion: Froglok has been set to globally KOS. Illusion: Froglok has the
same general faction as actual frogloks - the engine doesn't know how to
differentiate between the two. So unless they fix the illusion.... The class
choices and starting stats are interesting.

> Enhanced Looking For Group Tool

    Wheee, more tells when we're on raids and have LFG up to get grouped. I
wonder if the LFG tool will let someone see information a /who would not?

> New Cartography System

    Should be neat to see how this works, given the 3-D nature of dungeons.
Hopefully it'll beat just windowing out of EQ and looking at a site like
EQAtlas.

> New Magic Item slot: Charms

    Here's the hook for the powergamer set. Wonder if any older content
items will be flagged as charms? I wonder if any charms will be
player-crafted?

> Armor Dyes

    This is something that will please many, many people - but not me.
Today, you can look at a character and mostly know, based on what they
appear to be wearing, where they've been and what they're actually wearing
without inspecting them. It adds a certain prestige to items that appear
unique. If dyes are implemented the way players would want, there will be no
unique appearances. And if all colours aren't available, players won't be
completely happy as they won't always be able to get the "look" they want.

> Expanded bank capacity

    Make more turn-in quests for old items - that'll free up bank space! ;-)

> New spells

    I wonder if the utility spells in the high 40's and low 50's that were
recently flagged as "live" are actually part of this expansion. There's some
nice ones, and even one spell that would bump some of my other spells.

    Feel my pain, alt-healers. Shouldn't hurt too bad in PoP, though,
because heal aggro there was all but removed.

    Thank goodness! We had one encounter recently where an intermediate step
involves an NPC that puts a one hour, 90% slowdown curse on folks. With the
bug, we could not remove it with GRC or RC. So we had to either duel-kill
people with the curse, or duel them down to 5% health and have them camp out
and in. Big PITA.

    So much for using an insta-click to chain-cast spells. Wonder if they'll
also get rid of spell gem refresh, which is buggy in high-lag environments?

    It used to be line-of-sight, was nerfed to 200 and made very useless for
the AA cost, and now is up to 250. Whoop-de-doo. Set it back to
line-of-sight and fix the problem with bards being able to be invis or DA
and doing this, if that's the REAL issue (and it is).

    Hmm. I wonder if this is why NPCs had cropped text recently - part of it
was being sent to a window that didn't exist.

    So is it a violation of the EULA? If so, what section? Will people doing
this be banned or warned?

    Here's some of the things that have been done recently by people
"mining" for links:

-all stats on the undiscovered Cazic Thule tradeskill items were found. Most
of the items were crap, and people on EQTraders were warned what pieces NOT
to make given how insanely rare the drops were.
-the full set of Holy Symbols for priests were discovered. SOE simply hasn't
bothered implementing quests for them.
-several Kunark-era quests were revisited, and it was found that the drops
for them were not in game. These "undiscovered quests" are flat-out broken,
and it could not have been proven without mining.
-the effects for the PoP quest armour pieces were discovered, in particular
for those pieces that had yet to drop in game. The usual complaining started
about them, only now the complaining was over items that had never dropped
and which could have been retuned before ever dropping had someone not mined
the database.

    I let the reader judge why SOE wouldn't want players doing this.

    That's an interesting change. I wonder if other spawns that can be
"blown", like the trials in HoH, will receive similar changes.
