An earth pet would be useless for the purpose under discussion; preventing a
mezzed mob from attacking the chanter on break.  Not only will your earth pet
not cast his root on demand (its a frequent action... but not necessarily the
first thing he does) he won't attack that mezzed mob at all.  So you break mez,
the mob goes after the chanter, you sic pet, the mob eats the chanter for lunch,
then the pet finally gets around to rooting the mob... and causes all the prox
aggro troubles I described earlier.

Mage is one of my favorite classes... earth pet is my least favorite pet in the
game for most fights, due to its poorly planned root policy.

The command /pet no cast is badly needed!
