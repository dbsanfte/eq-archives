From what they say about "when EQ loses focus it will use less resources",
it sounds like we'll have to wait and see how that's implemented as to how
it stacks up.

However, since you now have to pay for that ability with EQPN (and that
wouldn't be so bad, except for the outrageous payment scheme they came up
with), I think the vast majority of people will be content with what they
implement and/or simply try to get them to adjust it to match EQPN's
functionality.
