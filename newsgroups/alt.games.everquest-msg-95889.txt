They are using more logic than you are. :-)  Unless the application is
pretty specialized, so you can get away with requiring your customers to
have a DVD drive, you can't do a DVD version *instead* a CD-ROM version.
You can at best do a DVD version *in addition to* a CD-ROM version.
That's pretty hard to justify.
