    I bet they're following the most popular creation guides, and what the
"average" person goes for in gear.

    Those figures are consequences of gear. I imagine part of the test will
show them that the average SK twink is much, much better at tanking than the
average PAL twink.

    Serp Bracers, lots of DEX/AGI? Or no other stats?

    The AC 12 shield had STR on it, or nothing? It may be that the gear kits
were created by setting someone loose in several Bazaars with a specific
budget and reflect choices made in other areas. And the rectangular one is a
Sarnak Battle Shield.

    Most "first time" SHMs make druid-like shamans, totally casting
oriented. People with cash to twink with are more able to make tank-mage
style shamans, as they can afford the high HP/WIS/MANA gear needed to keep
mana pool reasonably high after filling slots with Jaundiced Bone.

    Only thing I can think of, other than it happens to be a coincidental
focus on a typical piece of equipment, is that it was meant for use with
Malaise. At one point it did work on Malaise, and who knows how long ago
these gear sets were arrived at. But, since extended affliction was
supposedly NEVER supposed to work with pure debuffs, that can't be right,
right?

    Straw-Spun?

    12/25 is Centi Shortsword. 13/27 is odd - the only semi-common weapon I
can think of at that ratio is a Serpent's Tooth, and those are overpriced
because of the rogue thing. Sure it isn't a 14/27, which would match a Centi
Longsword?

    My buddy with the 55 rogue knows the game, or so I thought. You'd never
guess the kinds of crap I found on the little cleric he made, and which his
brother the 58 magician helped him equip. Really, people just don't know INT
to MANA conversion rates. And a lot of people aren't comfortable with not
having a permanent piece of gear for a given slot.

    The CCS had no MANA or HPs. What you listed sounds like an Oracle Robe,
which would be very popular for the Imp Dam I focus and the low price, but
it has no HPs. That's a stumper.
