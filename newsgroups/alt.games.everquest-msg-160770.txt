Actually, at lower levels, +Mana is better than +Wisdom or +Int.  As you get
higher in level, the Wisdom/Int has more effect on your mana pool,
basically, your mana up to wisdom/int 200 is ((Level/5)+2)*Wisdom(or Int).
So, at level 30, Each point of Wisdom/Int is worth 6 mana.  If you have to
choose between say 3 wisdom, and 30 mana, take the mana item for now.  If
you are a tradeskiller, then, max out Wisdom/Int.
