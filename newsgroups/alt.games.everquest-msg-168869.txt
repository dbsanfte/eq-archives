And in your case, I'd say you were still acting on true "need" and not
simple greed. At least there's a chance that you'll get the spell you
need. The OP was a melee. Melee rolling on parchments is FuckedUpToHell
(TM) unless every caster in the group has all their spells already. Then
it should be acknowledged that it's just going to be greed rolls.
Nothing wrong with that in a pickup group, as long as everyone knows it
and everything is a greed roll.
