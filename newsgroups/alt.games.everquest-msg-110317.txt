Nope. Taking advantage of an obvious oversight on terrain design to
make killing an uber mob MUCH easier than it should have been is an
exploit. You are basically cheating. You KNOW the mob can't get your
clerics under the bridge. If it were fair, the mob would be able to
get at ANY party member. After all, this mob's abilities are clearly
superior to those of any single player. You're using a coding flaw to
defeat a mob, plain and simple.

Additionally, just because a coding (in this case pathing I guess)
flaw exists, doesn't mean that Verant programmers were "lazy". It only
means that they, as humans will do on occasion, made a mistake. If the
fix is simple, it happens very quickly. If it involves many possible
related issues, it may NEVER be fixed. That doesn't mean it's not
cheating to take advantage of it.

Regardless, it is Sony's game - Sony's rules. You'll pay for the
service as long as this point is acceptible to you - any longer and
you have only yourself to blame.
