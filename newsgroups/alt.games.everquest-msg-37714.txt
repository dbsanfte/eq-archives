News flash - variations on the "get a life" insult are considered
passe.

Big deal. I'm 573 years old and ran the computers on the Mayflower.

And how much money is that, exactly? I assume you can provide complete
details? Don't forget to include in your equation the cost of the
computers (do you even know how many physical server-quality machines
there are?), the cost of the internet connectivity to support all the
players on at peak times, the cost of the facilities and support
systems, the cost of salaries for programmers, content creators,
customer support, management, etc.

So, by all means, please tell us all "how much money they make on this
game". I'm sure we'd be fascinated to watch you back up your comments
with some facts.

And no doubt if they felt they were in danger of losing 10-30% of
their user base, they'd take steps. Apparently, though, you invented
this number, too.
