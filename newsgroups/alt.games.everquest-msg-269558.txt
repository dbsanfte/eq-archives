Will there be a bazaar in EverQuest II?

There is no Bazaar zone in EverQuest II as there is in EQ. Instead, each 
city has a market. You can open up a store within your home and put items up 
for sale, which can either be purchased directly from you or through a 
broker. The standard market is accessible only within city borders, but 
items listed for sale in the opposing city may be purchased through a 
black-market broker (for a price, of course).

Can I put items up for sale anywhere?

In order to list your items for sale in the city market, you must be online 
and in your house. You can enter vendor mode which lets you be away from the 
keyboard while still allowing other players to buy from you.

Why did you decide on an online vendor model instead of allowing sales while 
the player is offline?

We understand that offline vending makes buying and selling easy, and some 
players would like the convenience of this feature.
However, there is a downside to such convenience. The ability to instantly 
buy any item at any time changes the fundamental experience of the game. 
Instead of logging in to seek adventure, you're logging in to go to an 
online shopping mall. The fun of this game is meant to be in going out and 
killing monsters to get loot and finding components to make items, not 
clicking the mouse a few times to have whatever you want.
The online vendor model allows a lot of convenience while still putting 
limitations on the flow of items and cash in the market. The economy is 
bound to grow quickly on its own, and we prefer not to accelerate the pace 
immediately by making buying and selling instantly trivial.
