While I normally just snoop around on this newsgroup and not post here, I
feel the need to make an exception.  This is why...  Who the hell cares what
kind of military background this man has?  And by the way, Unless you have
some way to get around the 1974 Privacy Act, the government can not release
his 2-1 file to anyone but his family or authorized agency.  It is not
unbelievable that anyone from the military with any kind of background would
troll here and make whatever sort of claims or posts that he did make.
Sure, he might be a moron, but I've met a TON of former and current
Airborne/Ranger/SF guys that were complete and total morons.  As for me, I'm
just a broke-dick Paratrooper who's still stationed at US Army Southern
European Task Force in Vincenza, Italy.  See, I hurt myself beyond repair in
an Airborne Op in early March, so what am I doing now?  Snooping the Boards
and playing Everquest.  Why?  Well, partially because I can't walk anymore,
and partially because it's just what I enjoy to do.  So quit dragging this
this issue out, quit making shit up (On both sides of the issue), and just
play some freakin Everquest; because nobody cares.
