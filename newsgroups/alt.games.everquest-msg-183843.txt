If i tank or a warrior tanks, the difference isn't noticable.  Kill rates
are the same, mana is the same.  At the end of the day if I needed one more
cheal.. well that 1 extra % of mana for me tanking than a warrior... and it
never becomes an issue cuz a 5 min bathroom break after an hour makes up the
difference.

Maybe the zone isn't challenging enough, shrug HoH isn't the toughest of
places.

Not sure why you'd think I don't play my monk anymore... if im online, its
monk or rogue, and the rogue (created 1 month ago) is at 3-4 days played, so
he's hardly had any time put into him at all (check AGE channel to see if im
online much or not)

Hes not insanely equipped, he's nowhere near the best geared monk on prexus
(let alone EQ), he just has gear about in line with how much he plays/raids
