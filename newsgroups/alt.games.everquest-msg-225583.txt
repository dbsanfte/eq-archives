Thats coz, if you have an alchemy skill way above the trivial, and a
geerlok, KEI/int+wis booster, etc, and high faction+cha etc. The
actual parts cost just over 5pp a go per attempt, if you get to a
poitn where you succeed in most of them you can still make a profit.

For those of us who havent reached this point, yeah it costs about 120
a go and no one wants to buy at that price so we dont make a profit.

Tradeskilling for me has always been a bit of a let down, few of the
items you can make with say smithing or tailoring compare to do drops.
I made my cleric some of the LDoN armor with wis on, the stats were
good, but for stuff that cost minimum 100pp in raw parts, and a 250
skill (not trivial), Im sorry, but, I think (offhand) the breastplate
is like 26ac with +4 wis? now thats nice, and all, but, part of me
looks and says "is that it?" for all the hours clicking and faffing
and money that goes into it.. 

There is money to be made, stuff for PToC quest, food, drink, stuff
like that, but how many players run round wih a hand made weapon??
