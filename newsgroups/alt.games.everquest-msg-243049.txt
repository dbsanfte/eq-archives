I've heard this claimed a couple of times now but I don't accept
it without some more substantial evidence. I'd guess a few thousand
players have been using eqlogin3 over the last few days - it would
be very bad practice to ban people for it.

I have heard that it's possible to use the eqlogin3 server to log
in after a patch before the servers are supposed to be opened. If
you do this chances are higher that you'll receive a ban or a
warning.
