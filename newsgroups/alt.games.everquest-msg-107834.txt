I asked them about that, the trackIR.  I think I'm going to get it as
soon as i have the funds.  what it does is take over for your mouse,
so you can control POV by just looking around.  It doesn't work like
you can look all around the room, because then you'd be taking your
eyes off the screen. but if you glance towards the top of your
monitor, it will pan up.  would be pretty cool if I could play in 3D
and just look around...then again, i might never get out of my chair:)
