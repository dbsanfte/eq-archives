Really that sucks , sounds like they need to work on the character creation department before they release 
SWG then , the tuskan raider was just an example I don't really care if they are in the game or not but I'm 
assuming that you must be able to be a jedi which rules out the sith lord as a char. choice which is retarded
if they don't expect people to want to play a Sith lord they never should've created such a damn cool 
character as Darth maul for fucks sake.

HEY VERANT WISE UP!!!
 
For curiosity's sake , what character choices will there be available?
