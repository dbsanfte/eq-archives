There may be, but I'm of the firm belief that there's absolutely NO rhyme or
reason to it...that the people who type in the names above the critter's
head are simply not paying attention.

That is why there are "Sarnak Recruits," "sarnak recruits;" "an orc
warrior," "a orc warrior;" "fire beetles," and "fire beatles"(though I think
they finally fixed that one).

The critters undoubtedly are different in some way, but it's NOT to provide
a hint, it's due to bad or inconsistent typing.  I'm of another firm
belief...that Verant hired no editors.  Hell, I've noted one misspelling so
far in Luclin...and I'm not even looking.  At least they're doing
better...if it was 3 years ago I probably would have noticed a half dozen by
now. :)
