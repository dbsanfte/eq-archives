I'm not going to reply to all the points in your post I feel I could
reply to, because it seems to me you have me confused with some bad
clerics you've played with in the past (and Lord knows, I think we've
all played with bad players of almost every class at one point or
another).  Several of the things you perceived in my post are in
direct contradiction to what the post actually said, at least as I
intended them.  But let that pass.

Three mobs, three tanks (I didn't specify how many tanks in the
original post, but that's what it was).  Tanks all wailing on one.
Suddenly your health goes from 1 bubble to 3 and a half and, lo and
behold, you're now getting hit by only mob instead of 3.  Pretty
obvious where the other two went, isn't it?  What do you think the
cleric's chances are of rooting both mobs while both of them are
beating on him?

I never said I wasn't doing my job.  I never said I wasn't paying
attention.  I never said I wasn't trying to root them before I healed.
I simply detailed a situation that actually happened.  (What actually
happened is that I think I had one rooted which happened to break just
as I HAD to heal the tank.)

If your position is that all three tanks should continue to attack the
initial target until the cleric actually *says* something, then, yes,
we're going to have to agree to disagree.  I don't think the cleric
should *have* to say anything in a situation like that.

In my opinion, the tanks should be intelligent enough to realize that
*of course* the cleric is going to need help and at least one of them
should peel off to go help him.  My position is that getting a mob off
a caster is more important than some small delay in finishing off the
initial target.

The problem with the "I'm going to blindly keep fighting what I was
fighting until the caster says something" position is that there's a
natural tendency on the caster's part to try at first to cope with the
mobs, for a few seconds anyway, until he realizes it's almost
hopeless, by which point he may have lost a substantial amount of
health.  Further, the caster's cry for help can be delayed by lag or
lost in battle spam.  You can watch his health bar, but, again, by the
time you respond (especially to the weaker casters) it could easily be
too late.

We are certainly close to each other's position but not, I think, in
complete accord.
