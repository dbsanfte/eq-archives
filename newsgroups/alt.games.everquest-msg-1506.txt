Yes, a dr00d is not able to understand caring about those around them,
but their behavior can be modified at times by focusing on what they do
care about, namely their own progress.  I've yet to have a dr00d who
couldn't understand the meaning of one of the following shouts, both of
which I am not shy about using.

MyCleric shouts: Freaking dr00d!  Thats it I'm memming Atone!

MyEnchanter shouts: Run em through us again dr00dboy, mind wipe up.

Only had one who was so thick I actually had to cast it and he learned
quickly.  Most understand that either of these two classes can protect
themselves and their groups from morons who like to agro the parade on
another group so they can med for a bit.  

th
Just cause I play a druid sometimes is no reason not to hate dr00ds.
