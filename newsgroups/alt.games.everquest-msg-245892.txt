What about elemental gear?

The point is the best stuff is dropped. Crafters can aug the best stuff, 
and make the 2nd best stuff.

I'd never have a 'crafter' class in a game I designed; I don't think 
people who want to make stuff necessarily want to forego actually 
playing the rest of the game.

I think EQs system is a better setup. Anyone can become crafter... there 
are some gimp issues though...but that's not at issue right now.

See comment about elemental armour above.

Yeah. That doesn't make it 'best in class'.

How many thousands of people are in any given zone at once? The point is 
nobody plays with 1000's of people at once. For all the MM is hyped up 
to be, i can encounter just as many people hopping around the battlenet 
chatroom and game instances in Diablo2.

20% market is a commercial success. If it can appeal long term to enough 
players to be profitable over time then it was good, at least from an 
objective standpoint. Subjectively I'll always think it sucks.

True. But that logic gets you to arguing that EQ is a collossal failure 
because 90%+ of gamers do not play it...

EQ has a substantial share of those too. 8(
