Interesting you should mention EQ Casters, because I had myself
questioned the changes they made to their Cleric creation guide and
I'd like to find out what experienced clerics here think.  

Before, they used to suggest (and it was generally considered to be
the norm) that a player put most of their cleric's starting points in
WIS and the extra points somewhere else (usually either STR or AGI).
Now they have changed that and suggest that clerics should focus on
STA (and for certain races they don't suggest adding any WIS at all!),
with their reasoning being that STA items are harder to find than WIS
items.  Here are their suggestions for each race cleric:

====================

For Dark Elves add 25 Stamina, 5 Strength
For Erudites add 20 Stamina, 5 Strength, 5 Agility
For Gnomes add 20 Stamina, 10 Wisdom
For Humans add 20 Stamina, 10 Wisdom
For Halflings add 20 Stamina, 10 Wisdom 
For High Elves add 25 Stamina, 5 Strength
For Dwarves add 20 Stamina, 10 Wisdom
For Frogloks add 20 Stamina, 10 Wisdom

====================

I think one reason I questioned it was because they used to suggest
that Dwarves add 25 to WIS and 5 to AGI to get their AGI to 75 so they
won't suffer an AC hit for being under 75, but as you can see above,
they no longer suggest adding 5 to AGI (plus dwarves have the highest
base STA of cleric races anyway).

Anyway, again I'm just wondering if you experienced clerics agree or
disagree.

TIA,
