Well - attribute points are my choices

Sorry - yes, agi (9?) definitely serp bracers.

Str on the shield sounds right

Hmmm, my first shaman (no twinking beyond spell cash) was definitely
oriented to AC first.

Yes, it used to work on Malaise - but that's a level 24
spell for mages.  I think it was coincidental, or maybe they
share gear with other int casters?

That's the one :)

14/27 might be right - I didn't write it down like I did
the bard.  I kept deleting the old char and creating a new
one with the same name so the screen layout would be set up
for me :)

Lol - I still have 4 slots without permanent gear in them 
(ear,wrist,finger,ammo)

I might be misremembering the hp on the robe.
In general it sounds like you're correct about
how they came up with the choices - except the 
BL where all the visible stuff was the shadeweaver
quest items (all of which my BL got except the 
BP) all of which is No-Drop.  Even the Ikky BL's
get it.  They got hosed on their rings though -
the AC 1, Str +2 rings that drop from the bandits
in Paludal (Like the dervish cutthroat rings).

What do you suppose the rings (5ac, 3str) are?
All the melee (Looked at War, Rng, Pal, SK, Mnk,
BL) but the BL got them.

Also, a quick look at my bard showed why the boots
were so high ac - they're green.  They're singing
steel boots (!)  Of course, they merely make up
for the loss in the face/cloak/shoulder where the
items were dramatically worse than the leather class
BL.

I'm going to play a character on Test now - for days
when my friends aren't on and I don't feel like the
PITA of pickup groups or soloing my mage.  I haven't
decided what to play yet (Bard, SK and BL are the 
top choices in my mind).

Also, I'd hesitate to call these guys "twinked", the
BL at least could easily have everything but the BP,
and probably have earned enough for a treeweave, by
25.  The treeweave is +11 raw ac, but a loss of +40
HP.  The reason I say this, is because I quested all
that visible gear by 12 without much trouble (excepting
the TW).
