You are correct - all your items are stored on the server - just your macros
and options are stored in your machine.  All you have to do is copy your
entire EQ directory to the new drive and update your shortcuts.

I created a 3GB partition solely for everquest.  (Thank you Partition
Magic!) As it changes a lot (log files, patch messages (yes I keep a copy of
each eqnews.txt file as it gets downloaded!) new executable, the odd new
texture) I defrag(*) it a lot, and it takes a lot less time as it's a
relatively small partition.  With all 3 expansions and texture caching on I
still have about 600Mb left but I suppose I will resize it when PoP comes
out.

(* This is a bit OT - relates to performance) If anyone uses good ole'
Norton Speed Disk 2001 to defrag, you can set the file placement options to
put the
(reasonably) static files (zone models, character models, sound files and
texture files) together at the start of the drive, and then the executables,
log files and patch messages.  This minimises defrag times and I *seem* to
get decent zoning times too.
Having the swap/page file on a different physical hard drive helps bigtime
as well.
My machine is a dual boot (Win98/Win2K) PII 450 with 512 MB Ram and a 32 MB
ATI Rage 128 Pro.  I get good performance under Win98 but it's noticeably
better under Win2K (better virtual memory mgmt etc) but the 60Hz frame rate
kills me after a while.  I haven't found a tweak for the older ATI cards to
lock the frame rate yet :(
