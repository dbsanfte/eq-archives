Because -my- definition of cheating would be "doing something against the
rules in order to win a competition".  If you feel EQ is a software toy,
and not a game...that is, it has no finish line, rather it's a big
interactive environment...then your viewpoint becomes a lot different.

From that point of view, I view things like terrain exploits as cheating,
but not purchasing equipment or characters.  Purchasing a character for
the purpose of winning a competition of some kind, like a best of the
best or whatever they call it?  Yeah, sure.  Purchasing a character so 
you can float around, get your Gimp killed, and post neat stories on 
Usenet?  I got no problems.  In the normal course of the game, I'm not in
competition with anyone but my own self, and I reserve the right to
define my own rules for the experience.

Still wouldn't pay $175 for a fungi tunic, though.  :P
