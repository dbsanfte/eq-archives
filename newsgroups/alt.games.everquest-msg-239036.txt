In the bazaar, since they've changed to listing items as "Haste: 22%"
rather than "Haste" they seem to have removed the ability to select
items that have a haste effect.

Same seems to apply to flowing thought items. 

Has any noticed any other functions of the bazaar window removed by
this change?

I've rasised a /bug but it looks as though it was an intentional
change which is a shame.
