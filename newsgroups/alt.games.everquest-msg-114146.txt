I feel your pain. However, I'm sure that this particular time slot
inconveniences a *much* lower percentage of people than any other. I
don't think they will ever say, "You know what, let's apply this patch
at 8:00pm EST when 80% of the EQ subscribers are wanting to play so
that we may give that other 20% a fair shake, how about it?"

The numbers here are purely hypothetical, but I'm sure the
relationship sound.
