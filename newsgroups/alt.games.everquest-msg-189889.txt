The last time this cropped up, somebody posted a test that they had run:
- One person did lots of high-aggro things to a MOB.
- Second person taunted *once* and the MOB switched targets to them.

This seems to me to be a much simpler test of how taunt works and the
results are difficult to argue with (assuming the test actually happened,
as this is effectively hearsay from your viewpoint).

I used to follow the "taunt adds hate" viewpoint myself, but many
people with significant experience with the skill gave lots of evidence
otherwise, so I changed my mind. :-)
