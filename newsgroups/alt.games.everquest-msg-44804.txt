At 67 skill it would be far easier for you to just start with banded
armor gorgets. I think you can make that in Ogguk right? As someone
else said check out

www.eqtraders.com

If you can't make it in ogguk, you'll have to do the longer thing of
getting bound in neriak where I think you have to make your own steel
plates for banded. 

I suggest banded because doing smithing "right" is very horrible. 
Banded gorgets are a simple few piece item which you can make attempts
at rather quickly and you should also see nice skill raises.

Your charisma is really the bad part. Trade skills basically use
whatever is higher your int or your wis. At 80 you are pretty okay
really and the other thing smithing uses is your Str which is also
probably pretty ok. As you say its your charisma making stuff
expensive. Muling with an enchanter for pricing when you only have on
account really sucks so I'd suggest getting a ghetto charisma kit as
cheap as you can. 

Save up some money and instead of spending it on smithing, keep your
eye out for jewelers selling cheap charisma braclets and the like or
ask one abou the plus 7 charisma or whatever ones. Those are pretty
cheap if I remember right. I think you can get two plus 7 charisma
bracers and a charisma neck thing for really not all that much money.
That would add something like 21 charisma right there, this would make
a larger difference than you'd think.

What you may want to do is adventure some and build up more money and
be on the lookout for cheap plus charisma stuff. I tried smithing on a
wood elf druid like at level 12, gave it up for a while and tried at
level 35 when I had a couple thousand plat and pretty okay stuff (non
twinked) and it made all the difference in the world. Instead of
smithing the "right" way I simply did it the wrong fast way and went
from like 45 to 175 smithing in 2 hours in freeport.
