Well, in the midst of EW, there is a statue of a sleeping dragon, which
may or may not have any bearing... he's holding a globe of some kind,
IIRC, although I don't see how its informative.

If there is an actual globe somewhere, which is to say a ball with a map
of the world, rather than just something spherical in shape, then -that-
would logically answer your question, but what this would have to do
with any statue of a dragon I've seen, I don't know.
