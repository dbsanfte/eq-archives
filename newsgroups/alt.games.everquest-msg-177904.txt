What BIOS issue?  I upgraded to the latest a month ago and got
something similar to what you describe, the router would hang after 20
or 30 minutes with no activity.  It required a reset to fix.

I downgraded the firmware and everything was again.  However I find I
go LD about 5 times in 4 hours, something which never happened in 3
years prior to all this crap.
