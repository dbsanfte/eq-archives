Hiyas! =)

I am on a different server (Veeshan) and, a while back, ran into a PC that
told me she had been bounced from her guild for making a trade without an
officer present. I hadn't thought about it until now (thought the officers
were just kind of "hard-nosed), but this kind of behavior must've been why
that particular guild (sorry, don't recall their name) had established that
rule and enforced it so vehemently. I agree totally with all of the advice
given here about researching a guild before joining and doubly so before
buying/selling anything (have been burned myself). I hate that it happened
to your friend...

Happy hunting!
