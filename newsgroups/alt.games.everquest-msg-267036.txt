Tried defragging ?  With such a huge install, files are going to be

another drives, then moved them all back.  Infinitely faster than
defragging, but you need a lot of space on your other drives.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
