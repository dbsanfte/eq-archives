OMG the whole game will fall apart.

Spiderling Silk still sell to players for 4-5pp each in about 20 
seconds.  LQ/MQ/HQ pelts still sell to players in huge quantities.

On the progression server the cost of those items will be lower due to 
the amount of cash the buyers will have, but it will increase over time, 
on other servers it will remain unchanged by the introduction of the 
progression server.  Generally, player-to-player sales are the better 
way to make cash.

The demand for tradeskill ingredients will be huge on the progression 
server, I just don't know how the buyers will fund their thirst.

Finally, if you want some cash quick, do the postal delivery quests.
