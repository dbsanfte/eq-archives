While I agree the process may be flawed at the delivery, errors and
congestion.  The patches show they are now aware of the issues and
trying to fix them.
I am not a VAK or Fanboi(fanboy) but I do enjoy My Everquest time other
then dying what I consider an inordinate amount of times per level.

Just wondering how many people here are running 40 Plus servers, with on
the average 400,000 or so folks wanting to play your game, with about
400,000 different pc configurations and figured out all the glitches and
pops?

Hmm?
