I would suppose that you are looking for the ring for the cleric epic,
yes? It's not really a well, though it is described that way in the
write-up you are probably looking at... It's sort of a pit or well,
but not very deep, only about 4 feet, more like an indention. Anyway
the room you are looking for is about in the middle of a line drawn
between the 17 and 18 on this map.

Got two in about 4 hours. Can be fun to slaughter the King and
everything around, the drops might be able to be given to newbies, or
turned in for tribute.

Of course I could be wrong may not be reading the cleric epic write-up
I did. If that's the case, then I don't know. =)
