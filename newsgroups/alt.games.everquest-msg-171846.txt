Amazing loot?.. hmm.. did you get multiple pairs of gloves?
It seems his only worthwhile loot really... in the times we've killed him
that gloves didn't drop, every single item was FFA/Rotting

Well, I went on my rant about ME a while back and nobody really supported
that, so tough !  I hope you have to do the camps again many times, share my
pain !  :(
2 down 3 to go for me... I haven't even thought about trying the camps again
in a good while  /shudder

I do totally agree about ME though... and not because I don't want to put
the time in again (I spent 2 days in acrylia for my shard and don't think
that shard part is busted).. its just tedious.. a ridiculous camp in a
ridiculous zone

Man thats irritating... :)  When a class with improved invisibility (cannot
fade early) dies in a zone where nothing sees invis.. grrr
Pointless deaths make me pissy when it holds a raid up

VT is the best designed zone I've seen (architecture wise, most definately
NOT mob wise !!)
