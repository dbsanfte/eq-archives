I root and rooted regularly starting in my mid 40s or so.  No KEI, no 
clarity, no breeze.  Mana was never an issue for root rotting single mobs, 
could usually do two at a time, and get my mana back before going on to the 
next one(s).  At level 57, without KEI, it was a close race between mana 
and mob dying in PoN.  At level 58, without KEI, but with epic DoT, it was 
easy again.  Mana recovery becomes easy with kragg's mending to add to the 
mix.  I have never heard a shaman say that root/rot is ineffective, the 
DoTs are far and away the best damage for mana spent that a shaman has.  I 
was doing this prior to the changes to DoT stacking, so I used only two, my  
best poison and disease based DoTs.  I rarely meleed, as I got pounded by 
the decent xp mobs.  I was not twinked, had, at best, average gear for my 
level throughout.  Still that way now, and I still happily root and rot for 
soloing in PoN.  I have recently found that I can effectively melee dark 
blue mushrooms in Fungus Grove, with the addition of my pet for added DPS.
