Yes. If *you* petition it, it's fine. If *we* petition it, we're
arrogant asses. Right.

No, I restrict my derogatory judgements to people who have an arrant
disregard for the rules of the game and anybody else's enjoyment of it.

Actually, I don't know what the fuck the Iowa State Cyclones are. If
anything, he's named after one of the Stockton Wing, a Celtic music
group. It's not an uncommon name in Ireland.

Well spotted.

Funny, I was going to propose that you did exactly that just before I
read that line. If I'm called on those names and forced to change them,
I'll just shrug and do it. You won't see me bitching about it. When I
picked those names I did it fully knowing I was skirting the EULA. If
someone is troubled by them, well, I guess I'll have to change them and
live with it.

Actually, that's the spelling used in Wagner's opera. I'm not a great
fan of creative d00d spellings.
