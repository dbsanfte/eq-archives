/Hail and well met a.g.e'ers
OK, OK, I know, I have looked up the zone hunting guides and level
requirements, but I value this group's advice:
As an Iksar Monk, where can I solo fastest from 46 to 50th?
Looking at teh Monkly-Business.com site and otehr resources, bugger all will
improve between now and 50th, skills-wise. It's not as if we get any new
abilities/disciplines, our attacks and defences are all maxxed by now and
capped at around 200 (HTH at 225 and 1hB at 230?) and we have nothing much
to look forward to in terms of gear, either.
I dinged 46th (Yay me! Planar content is now MINE!!! Woot!), as I just solod
the last few blues in OT at the FM zone, ever watchful for Dragoons... I
suppose I can go back there.

Yes, I am blessed by teh presence of a once-per week (soon to be twice?)
regular group which kicks butt - Wizzy, Chanter, Cleric Druid and Warrior,
plus yours truly - (plus their characters have the advantage of higher
level...err.. benefactors/patrons... yes, that's it - which I do not). Very
good group balance, we go all sorts of places and get funny tells from the
guild - "What are you doing THERE?" "Grinding exp, an looting"

In between times, I need to make up myexp penalty (-20% for us Iksar) So,
what's the current hotlist of places to be seen?

As I play at odd times or intermittently, or may have the kids to look after
if they wake up (Monk=FD therefore ideal) I have a bit of an issue with
grouping. Not good if yer puller FD's and stays down fror the next three
combats.

Dreadlands = DULL lands, please... no... more... can't take IT!
Alternatives?

Izaak is well equipped, not twinked, and I have no problems buying Aego etc
or receiving teh regular and Highly pleasant MGB's at the PoK Bank...

All suggestions are welcomed.

Happy hunting one and all.
