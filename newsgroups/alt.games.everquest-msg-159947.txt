Know more as in what?  It's one of the faction quests people use to
gain Kael faction.  The Kromrif Recruiter is the giant at the zone-in
from EW that takes Coldain Heads in return for faction.  After doing
that a few times, you can give them to Captain Bvellous for better
faction (and Tormax faction hits as well.)
