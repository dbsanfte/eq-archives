I just picked up a Djarn's Amethyst Ring for my 31 shaman, 80 HP,
spell haste II, so an upgrade from my 75HP neg 10 SvM ring...

I still have my Bracelet of Woven Grass, which is a Spell Haste I
item.

Looking at Flash of Light:

Nothing: 1.5 sec cast time
Woven alone: 1.3 cast time
Djarn's alone, 1.5 cast time
Woven and Djarn, 1.3 cast time.

So as I surmised, the Spell Haste I item affects spells which cast
too quickly for Spell Haste II to affect, if those spells are within
the level limit.

I also looked at Root.

Nothing: 2.0 cast time
Woven alone: 1.7 cast time
Djarn's alone: 1.7 cast time
Woven and Djarn's: 1.7 cast time

This means that the dividing line is indeed 2.0, not "over 2.0",
Spell Haste II works on Root

I also looked at Canni I, a level 24 spell

Nothing: 1.3 cast time
Woven: 1.3 cast time
Djarn's alone : 1.3 cast time
Woven and Djarn's: 1.3 cast time

Because the level is too high, Spell Haste I doesn't work.  Because
the cast time is under 2.0, Spell Haste II doesn't work.

Still haven't looked into Blessing of Piety, Blessing of Faith,
Blessing of Reverence, to see if they too affect different minimum
duration spells.
