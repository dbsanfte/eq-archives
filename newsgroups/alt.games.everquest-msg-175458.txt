I for one quit playing EQ about two months ago (still like the game, just
not playing right now so don't attack), and am only now considering coming
back because my dream has come true......  I've wanted to play a Froglok for
the last 2 years, and while I can't decide if I really want to buy ANOTHER
expansion, if I do it'll mainly be for the frogs!  ^_^
