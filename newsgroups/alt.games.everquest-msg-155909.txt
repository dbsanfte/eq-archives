Thats just it.  This guy was "/ooc casting KEI for donations".  No one asked
him for it, he was offering it for donations.  I have never EVER asked anyone
for any buff or sow who wasn't offering it.  Even when on a corpse run.  I
*have* done the following:
"/ooc Gladly donating 10 plat for a SOW...."
"/ooc Gladly donating 50 plat for a KEI...."
If I get no responses I move on, no harm, no foul.
