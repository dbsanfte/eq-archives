Her son was an adult, true; but she and the other members of that family
created and nurtured him for the vast majority of his short life. His
problems were preexisting. Either his problems were genetic/chemical or
they were environmental; either way, his mental health was certainly far
more of her making and her responsibility than it was Verant's or the
online EQ community. He was only 21. She was the person supposedly in
charge for 18 of those years. Either she actively helped create the
difficulties he faced, or she failed to provide him with the
professional help he needed to overcome them, or (IMHO most likely,
based on similar situations of which I have personal knowledge) a little
of both. I'm not saying she is totally to blame, since I have no idea
what kind of care she provided or other details of the situation; but I
do believe she bears a considerable burden of guilt that she can't or
won't face.

I'd have to go along with "blame the lawyers" though.
