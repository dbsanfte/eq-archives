Congratulations. You figured it out and you win the prize. The GB quest
mobs weren't put there so people of a rediculous level compared to all
the other mobs in the zone could safely farm them through several
levels. They were put in as part of what should be a pretty difficult
quest for a mid thirties player to get a really nice blade.
  Having said that, yes. I farmed the Najena skellies that drop the hilt
through two levels solo back before they got nerfed, but I realized that
it was *far* too easy, and predicted back then that it would be changed
to make it tougher.
  Also, this change, as you point out, will make it less appealing for a
group of 30 somethings to sit there all night farming them and making it
impossible for somebody who really *wants* the quest item to get it.
