Monual,
I'd read somewhere that the POM quests were all shut off by Sony - that
they'd removed a key element from the drop tables, because the quests were
too easy and gave fantastic gear.  Have you seen anything said that they'd
un-broken the quests?  I'd hate to have you spend so much time for naught.
(Unless, of course, the Library Card was the removed part, in which case
you're golden!)
