I would like to ask everyone to uncheck gnomes in their Options for
character overlays.

This will save lots of memory, will make the game run smoother, and
will make me feel better.

I was a cute perky sweet gnome lady for 60 levels.  And now am a nasty
little witch.  Can't bear to play myself.

There has been very little discussion of character looks.  Most people
seem to be going with the flow.  I had a crush on assorted barbarians,
now they look like overweight idiots.  Oh sigh.

Well, in the realm of things, this isn't important. Love my new
beastlord and am having a fine time following the many quests.  But do
wish I could bring out my sweet gnome mage with out being embarrassed.
