Ok, just a simple observation, not meant as a flame.

They want to charge more for the "increased operating costs," right? I'm ok
with this if that means more servers to reduce lag and link deaths. However,
I doubt we will see more servers, since they have never addressed the link
death problem and keep telling us it's not on their end, even when 30 people
in a zone go LD (including my entire group) and everyone else shouts "lag
spike!" I think it's a way to milk more money from us, because if we stop
paying, we lose our characters we spent months working on.
