There's also one other thing you've forgotten: the 
comics hold an endless supply of bad guys.  So does the 
world.  And killing 1000 of them will only piss off the 
other 10000 and increase the number of attacks on you.

There is, of course, no way to avoid hurting innocent 
poeple IF Binwhatever did this, and IF the government 
won't hand him and his over to you - but is it so bad 
that some of us are trying to calm down the people who 
want to turn all of Afghanistan into a black, smoking 
hole in the ground?
