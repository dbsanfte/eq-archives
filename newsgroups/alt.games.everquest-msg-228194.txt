This makes no sense

A) I have to change it every time I go on a run, since I'm rarely with 
the same MA twice

B) If the designated MA isn't the MA for a particular fight (afk, dead, 
mezzed, monk wants to try one while the regular MA off tanks an add) 
I've got the wrong guy to assist

C) /attack on?  Are you mad?  I haven't attempted to hit anything with a 
weapon since 8th level, and I'm not about to start now!  I deliberately 
made sure my assist button does -not- turn attack on, and you want me to 
artificially recreate that old default mode?

D) Pause 2?  Two whole tenths of a second?  Mob might be dead before 
this macro finishes!  (clearly all that time as a bard makes me 
oversensitive to tiny delays)

E) What if I don't want my pet to attack yet?  Or what if he's busy off 
tanking an add?  Don't lets confuse the poor thing, he's got rocks in 
his head (or he's an airhead, or there's a fire in his brain, or he's 
waterlogged... depending)

a better macro would be

/target main_tank's_name
/assist

this would target main tank and then assist him, IF he's alive, or would 
assist whoever I currently have targetted if he's not alive.

I'd still have to change the hotkey every time the tank changes. 
Perhaps lazy isn't the word for my condition; habitbound.  I use f8 
because I've used f8 for so long its second nature.  Inertia also comes 
to mind.  I'm in a rut, it would take the application of a little energy 
to bump me up over the side of the dip, even though once I got out I'd 
be rolling free downhill.
