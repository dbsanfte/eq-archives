I think you're talking about the practice runes that are used to train your
research skill. I never bothered with it. You can dump your training poins
into research since theres not much else useful to spend them on, or get a
high level necro to make up your spells for you. If you spend as much time
as me finding the right words, you probably wont want to trust your own
research skill.
