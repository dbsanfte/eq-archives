What I mean is, $5k was enough to sell out his board to probably the biggest
scumbag in all of EQ?

I don't read monkly-bus so it doesn't make a big diff to me... but I think
were all aware who yantis is, and what kindof shit he's pulled in the past
(spaming the FUCK out of every eq related board you can find)

Maybe the writers of ShowEQ or EQmacro (major hex program) will sponsor
graffes when it next comes upto renewal time? :)
