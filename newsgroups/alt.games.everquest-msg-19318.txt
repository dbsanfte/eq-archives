AIEEEEEE!!!!! DO NOT make the threads into bandages!!!

I need threads to make leather padding, or cords for bearskin potion bags,
and making them into bandages is a waste of them, sell them to a tailor for
some money ( I will pay 20pp/stack easily )

Likewise, silk swatches can be sold to high levels trying to do the
thurgadin shawl quest for around 50pp/stack, sometimes a LOT more ( friend
was helping a guildie farm silk in EK, the guildie was paying 300/stack, and
stupid little unlucky me had just blown away 2 stacks on raw silk not 3
hours earlier.... )
