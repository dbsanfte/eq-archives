I've had moderately good luck following the northern route.  I do remember 
dying in one nuke that way once when I was about level 8 or so.  And I 
remember a while back coming up on Kith from WC with a fresh SoW, and 
thinking, "heck with it, IVU and I'm good to go!" and cutting straight 
across the middle.  Now I know this zone, but I was trying to have a 
conversation at the same time, and not really paying attention...

Coercer T'val has nuked YOU for 3 bubbs of life!

Ayyyiiiiaiiiieeeeee!

The amazing thing is, I made it to highpass.

Thank you, SoW. :)
