Unfortunately Wizards are broken, along with all casters.  The game is imbalance
in favor of the melee classes, due to slow mana regeneration rates, melees can
do more dammage over time then casters can.  In a fight with a warrior/monk and
wizard, if the wizard dose 1/2 dammage to the monster fight after fight, and the
warrior/monk then uses its bandages skill to 1/2 the wizard will not recover its
mana in that time.  The warrior/monk is doing two things taking dammage and
dishing out an equal amound, to the wizard's just doing 1/2 damamge, and is
falling behind.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind.
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
