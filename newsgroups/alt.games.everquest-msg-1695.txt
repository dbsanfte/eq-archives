Coupla points here - EQ hasn't been an RPG for a long time, if ever =/.
When it first came out it was classed as a MMORPG - Massively Multiplayer
Online Role-Playing Game.
Nowadays, however, it's referred to as a MMOG - Massively Multiplayer Online
Game.

The RPG aspect left for me when droods were camping good guards for the XP
and an SK friend of mine became amiable with the pallies in North Freeport,
but even before then it was a Quake clone for groups.

To be honest, if you want a more immersive world and more RP aspects, you
should try UO. Much easier to play - you don't need to find others to
group - and the Trade Skills system is actually useful ;).

My first MMOG was  EQ - I find myself staying because of the friendships
I've made, even in the face of utter boredom with the game. If the new games
coming out have the same social aspect as EQ, whilst improving the on the
actual playing side, I may stop EQ. Until then, for what I want, it's the
only game in town - unfortunately <g>


Andrew.
