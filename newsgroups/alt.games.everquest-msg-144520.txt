The key there is "Once *YOU'VE* (my emphasis) beaten everything there is
to beat ..."

Death of EQ? Doubtful. Death of the current generation of Uberguilds
when some significant portion of their members realize they've beaten
the whole game and play something else? Also doubtful. Enough other will
just enjoy the environment, or just be addicted, enough that they'll
stick around and start recruiting more up and coming folks. These will
be from the ranks of the 90% of the players who will likely *never*
"beat EQ" nor see the inside of Sleepers or VT. There's always still
more left to do for most of us.
