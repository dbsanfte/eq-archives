The problem that I have with it is that there are better ways to do it,
without breaking down the individual coins.

1) Random main.
Use the same system as currently, but assign a random member of the
group as the "looter". This way having a master looter does not mean
that that player gets all of the "extra" coins. Works out even over time

2) Eaqual coins.
The first pp goes to the looter the second to the next player etc. then
the first gold goes to the next player in sequence. e.g. :

A: loots a corpse holding 6pp 6gp 3sp
 
A: gets 2pp 1gp and 1sp
B: gets 2pp 1gp and 1sp
C: gets 1pp 2gp and 1sp
D: gets 1pp 2gp and 0sp

(while with the current system A would get 3pp3gp3sp and everyone else
1pp1gp0sp)

3) Best efforts split
The conis are split to be as eaqula as possible e.g. :

A: loots a corpse holding 6pp 6gp 3sp
 
A: gets 2pp 0gp and 0sp
B: gets 2pp 0gp and 0sp
C: gets 1pp 3gp and 2sp
D: gets 1pp 3gp and 1sp

4) A combination of (1) and (3)
So that coins are split best effort wise, starting from a random point.

5) Random split
Even a totally random split, each individual coin goes to a random party
member, would work out fairer over time.

Having said all this all the above would be harder to code and require
more CPU than the current solution. So I doubt that any would ever be
implemented.

I did post something similar to the Dev team once, but got no reply :-(

Ho humm,
