My druid just turned 21, woo hoo!  This is the highest level I've
gotten any of my characters to, so I'm a little unsure where to hunt.
Any suggestions?

Before you say "Lake of Ill Omen," I must say I don't have the
expansions yet, though I will probably get them within the next month
or so.  Also, please don't say "Karanas," I am so sick of those zones!
I am looking for a place where I can get a steady stream of mobs, or
maybe a place where I can camp them, like I did at the arena in LR (19
and 20, easiest levels yet).  Solo is preferred, but I might consider
grouping in a dungeon for a change of pace.
