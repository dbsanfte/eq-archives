The original post was about semantics.

It seems some people are trying to get a handle on why they don't like the
words "plz" and "thx", and having a very hard time in defining the problem
they have with it. Most of the claims ("its lazy" or "it shows a lack of
respect") have been refuted, so now it's down to "I don't like them because
they are abbreviations"
