Do you see your ping times going up?  Your packet-loss increasing?  
Anything, or do you just disconnect with no warning?  When you disconnect 
do you crash to desktop, to server select, to character select?  
I've found that one trick that really helps a BUNCH if you start seeing 
the first packet-loss number (the second number from the left) increasing 
is to hit /serverfilter on several times.  It's not perfect, but it has 
prevented literally dozens of LDs, especially in raid situations.
