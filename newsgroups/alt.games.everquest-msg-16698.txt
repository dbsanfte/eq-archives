Good luck in butcher block..

I was back playing my necro in lavastorm and then nektulos, it makes
you feel kinda funny when a lvl 2 guy with a sword larger than life
comes up to you and asks for spare arms, people like that is making
me not wan't to help. i gave a lvl 1 necro 10pp for spells and stuff
but maybe she allready had 1000pp in the bank, i try not to beg for
stuff but if someone offers me stuff i will accept it, it is more fun
to play the game earn the money and be able to buy the
staff/sword/armour you wan't.

As you mention maybe she didn't know how to respond to my tell
it worked out in the end i gave the stuff to another guy.

I to have been buffed by people running by, very kind of them 
but it surprises me everytime since i did not ask for it, but sow
is nice if you are in process of passing a zone or two.
