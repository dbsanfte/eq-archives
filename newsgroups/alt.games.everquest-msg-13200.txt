Depends on how many meats you handed in. I handed in one bagful with
my wood elf druid and one with my gnome. Both are now allied with the
Kelethin warrior guild (the warrior merchant is also an ally, but he
gives rotten prices), my druid was already amiable to the merchants
and was still amiable, while my gnome went from apprehensive to
amiable with the merchants. They've both also gone from apprehensive
to amiable with the Felwithe Merchants - shark meat raises that
faction as well.

Based on the faction tables that have been posted and the faction
adjustments on my gnome , I'd say you would have to hand in 4-500
meats just to get from amiable to kindly with the merchants (since the
merchant hit is much smaller than the warrior hit) and that is not
something I had the patience for even when meat was for sale.

Ironically, I restarted my wood elf warrior the day after the NPC was
permakilled, gave her half a bag of meat so she could get allied
faction with her guild (without ruining skills completely with too
much exp), and sold it all when I saw the NPC was gone :)
*shrug* If she ever goes back to Faydwer and I ever feel like killing
some sharks... :)
