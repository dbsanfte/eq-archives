    I read this as "baking" after a moment's thought.  You have gotten

   Hmm, this might work.  But say, don't *you* have a couple of kids?  You
could just do me a favor, an offer to let them candy till they puke if they
just eat this tv dinner first, the report back with the results.  I mean,
why would you even have kids in the first place if not to make such good
use of them when the situation demands?

   Fairly often.  I work 2nd shift, and there really aren't that many
people using the fridge at the time.  But not every time, to be sure.

   It might take days, but not weeks.  And I will be eating the tv dinner
that I'm keeping at my workstation, packed with a refreezable ice pack to
try to cut back on the chance of food poisoning.
