It should be fairly poor compared to a decently equipped pally of
similar level for at least one reason. Pallys have double attack so
they will be hitting much more often than the cleric. Since pallys got
their weapon skill raised a while back they shouldn't be missing as much
as they did back in the Kunark days. In the 50's a paladin is also
probably more likely to have a haste item than a cleric.
