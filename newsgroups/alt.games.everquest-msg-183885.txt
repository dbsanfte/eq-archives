I'm not surprised. Like most people, you probably have a very fuzzy notion
of what a "skill" is as well as an emotional investment in the answer.

What, you mean that besides all the communication between you and the
server, and all the knowledge built into the game, and all the knowledge
that you bring to the game, there's not much to it? Go figure! To misquote
Sherlock Holmes, once you've eliminated everything, don't be shocked to
discover there's nothing left.

PvP? Discovering tradeskill recipes? Learning how to do crowd control?  FD
pulling? Corpse art? Scaring the noobs with illusions? Visually tracking
the Tesch Mal you've tashed and the Tesch Mal everyone is meleeing from
the other 3 that are standing in the same gnoll pile? Carrying on 2 private
conversations, 1 guild chat, and 1 group chat without getting mistells?
Is learning something new the only thing you count as a skill? So, learning
how to do swarm kiting is a skill, but actually swarm kiting does not?

Perhaps if you gave us a definition of what a skill *is* instead of what
a skill *is not*, we could better tell you if the game requires any.

Could you give us some real world examples of a skill? Does being a concert
pianist count? or is that just finger+foot twitching and some nitpicky
knowledge about which notes to play and when? Is writing a novel a skill?
or is it just keypressing and nitpicky knowledge about what letter
combinations work well together? I'm happy to live with your definition
of skill for the sake of this question, but it's very inefficient to make
us guess what it is...
