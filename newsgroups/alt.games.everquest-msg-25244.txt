I guess the first question to ask is what does your vision of a
successful 50+ guild look like.

In my experience, there are 3 ways a 50+ guild can pull off successful
raiding:

- Tier 1 (true uber guilds)
These have a fairly small roster, but very dedicated players. Typically
the entry requirements will state that you have to play a certain number
of hours a week, attend a certain number of raids, etc. The loot rules
will always favour those who raid more. 

These can put together a large force because the majority of the guild
will be online and raiding during raiding hours.

Uber guilds can have a lot of fun in the game, because they will all
know each other well, and they get to kill rewarding and challenging
stuff. The trade-off is that not everyone wants to commit to playing the
game that much, week in week out.

- Tier 2 (zergling guild)
These have a very large roster (typically 100+ 50+ characters). Entry
requirements are fairly loose, sometimes nothing more than a minimum
level.

Consequently, they can put a large raid force together, typically
containing more people than strictly necessary.

The downside is that with that many people, most people end up not
knowing a majority of the people in the guild, so you lose the
atmosphere of playing with people you know and like. There is supposed
to be some research that says that the natural size of a human community
is around 30 to 40 people - more than that and you have an organisation,
not a community. This generally applies to zergling guilds.

Also, with that many people, it can be difficult to maintain discipline,
so incidents of kill-stealing, deliberate training etc. can be difficult
to avoid. So unless the leaders do a lot of work, zergling guilds tend
to end up with a bad reputation.

- Tier 3 (alliance member)
These are smaller guilds of less intensive players. Entry requirements
are about the same as for a Tier 2 guild, except with more emphasis on
the applicant being a person the rest of the guild will get along with.

A tier 3 guild will typically have an agreement with 2 to 3 other
similar guilds so that planned raids are posted to all guilds websites,
and perhaps the public server calendar if there is one.

In this way they can get together a raid force, but only slowly, with a
lot of advance notice. This means that they may be limited in their
possible targets - if a faster organising guild gets there first and
kills something with a long spawn time, then they are SoL.

There are other guilds with 50+ members, but they are usually either
'tags of convenience' (dead guilds kept around so the remaining members
don't show up as guildless), or stubborn higher level members of lower
level guilds.

On a mature server, your best chance is to get to be a tier 3 guild,
assuming such a thing exists on your server (on some servers, the tiers
1 and 2 seem to deliberately wipe out all completion, so it is join them
or stick to OS).

If you have one or two highly desirable 50+ characters (say a good monk
puller, or a cleric or two), then you may be able to find a tier 3 guild
to ally with you. The alternative is to pick two guilds of about your
level and mature together.

Note, in order to pull this off successfully, you will need to make some
hard decisions. In particular, you will almost certainly need to raise
the minimum entry level to the guild, and help existing characters to
level up. If you have a small number of people, spread out over levels,
then you will struggle to form viable groups. If you have a large number
of people, then you are no longer a community.
