And the sad thing is, Verant shows every appearance of becoming *worse*
since his departure. If this country (the US) were run by Verant,
Customer Service would still be insisting that there was no evidence that
the World Trade Center was blown up because the pictures they have show
the towers still standing.

If it is the act of a traitor to speak out against the
unConstitional acts of my government, to excercise my
rights guaranteed by that Constitution -- the right to
publish my opinions and speak my thoughts, the right
to petition for a redress of grievances, the right to
be secure in my person and property against search and
seizure without due process of law -- then I am a traitor.
And God grant us many, many more traitors, for we are in
dire need of them.
