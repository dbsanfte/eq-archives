Hi folks,

Looking for some groups/raids on Povar.  I worked hard to reach planar 
raiding level, then along comes EQ2 the same time I reach 60.  Now, raids 
have all but dried up for those of us not in Forces Unknown or Triton (and 
some other hard-core, you-can't-play-unless-you-are-level-70 guilds).  If 
anyone is interested in raiding, flags or otherwise, please /join flagraids. 
We are trying to keep things going for those of us who are wanting to 
continue with our EQ experience.  Take care, and see you on Povar.
