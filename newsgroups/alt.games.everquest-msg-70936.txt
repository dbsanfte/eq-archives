That must be some weird "rare occasion", when the cleric had over 110
KPlat available in the bank to drop on a horse.

And he must have had in excess of that in the bank, as I seriously
doubt he'd have drained his bank account to get the horse.  So, how
many rare occasions of 1 K profit does it take to acquire > 110 K in
the bank?  And if they're that common, how can you call them rare?
