Solo?... then yeppers, 'fraid so.

Dual boxing a druid and Monk on IGs is pretty easy... use the druid to
ensnare, then fear kite with the Monks Instill Doubt... if the druid loots
everything and saves even the copper, he can port out to sell and bank, then
gate back in just a couple of minutes now, thanks to Bazaar/Nexus ports.

I can hold the front 2, with the occaisional backroom if I didn't use Mend
on the first pair and it's not otherwise camped... and made the extra 7k I
needed for a Phase Carapace in a week.

Popping out to Bazaar bank via nexus and gating back to your camp makes cash
pharming a lot easier... you could even make reasonable money camping South
Karana for Avo's and Tech Mas if you don't mind the boredom... leaving RM to
the Rogues
