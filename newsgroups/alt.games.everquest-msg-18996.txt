Of late, I have noticed people getting to be pinheads in Everquest that
should know better.

Let me point out a case of a player we will call R.  Here are a list of
things he does that people shouldn't do, no matter what.

R decided to play a half-elf Paladin...  He runs around, smacking things
around and get hurt a lot.  He thinks it is a good idea to shout to the zone
"WILL SOMEONE HEAL ME!"  This is even before he gets up in levels.  He keeps
this up for a while, despite the fact all he has to do is sit down and rest.

R, later on, joins a Guild.  He bugs his guild members to get him outfitted.
He continues to bug people, even a druid if he has banded he could have.

R also starts to yell out if anyone has any bags he can buy from people.
Other people keep telling him where he can get them, but he ignores it and
keeps yelling if someone has any bags he can buy.  Someone decides to tell
him that they will sell him a bag for 5pp.  He scoffs then continues to yell
out to the zone to buy a bag.

R then starts to harass and insult his own guild members, even though the
guild officers tell him not to do it.  He keeps it up.  At one point, he is
booted and blames other members of the guild for getting him kicked out.

At this point...  People, don't be like player R.  When you are starting a
new character, don't harass people for stuff, let the higher levels give you
stuff.  Don't shout across the zone repeatedly for stuff, it just turns you
into something they want to tune out...  And given you are starting from
scratch, don't beg for heals, start fresh.

Another thing to take into consideration for you high level people starting
another character...  Don't TWINK your new character until AFTER 6th is
attained.  With the new reimbursement rules, if you lose your body, you lose
your stuff... Period.  It isn't worth the hassle to watch your twinked body
decay with the uber stuff you threw on it.  30 minute decay is bad.
