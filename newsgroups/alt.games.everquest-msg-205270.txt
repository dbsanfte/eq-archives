No problem!  ;-)

Should you ever start grouping, the ability to throw that spell is also one
of the more common duties of a druid in a group.  I always keep it memmed in
the last slot, and have a hotkey named 'Panic' which does the following:

/cast 8
/g PUNCHING OUT!
/g LESSER SUCCOR GOING OFF IN 11 SECONDS!
/g GET CLOSE ... NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND.

I have the messages in all caps so that they can more easily be seen over
the group spam.

fwiw ...
