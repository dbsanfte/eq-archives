Agreed.  Scary some of the prices people are paying for some of the
tradeskill stuff these days.  Prices that I still shake my head at:

Silk Swatches - Up to 400 to 600pp per stack

Leather Padding - Sold 2 Stacks of these for 600pp per stack (and I am
LOW END)

Iron Oxide - Running 500 to 1k EACH.

It is just unbelieveable.   Almost as funny as seeing people with HQ
Cat pelts for 30pp each, or 1dmg 150rng arrows for 10pp per stack,
2dmg for 20 LOL.

Never ceases to amaze me.
