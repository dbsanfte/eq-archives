Vowels.  They should get some vowels.  I mean, without vowels, you're 
pretty much guessing, which is great when everyone already knows the 
word in question and are just reminding themselves; it saves time and 
space.  I remember from Notehand class, my teacher trying to explain the 
same concept to me.  Just enough to remind you.

But what happens two thousand years later, when the name has been kept 
hush hush, and all you've got is some consonants written down by some 
scribe in a hurry?  Yep, same thing that happened to me when I tried to 
remember what the hell my note smst mghm meant.  Sommerset Magham?  Bah, 
I can't spell it to this day, and I barely remember how to pronounce it 
other than that it isn't like its spelled.

Otherwise, well, if you're discussing the hypothetical creater of life, 
the universe and everything, perhaps saving time and space shouldn't be 
your biggest concern.  A nice easy to figure out name, like Douglas, 
would be a lot better.
