I have an old Pentium pro which runs this software
I use it to help keep track of my location in new zones I wander thru.
First time going thru WL this was handy. with heavy trees I often get
turned around due to lag/graphic bogdown.
It is nice to make "notes" on map with things you find so can remember loc.
The death loc marker is ok as long as you hit /loc prior to death.
I am good at using /loc for directions this just is a handy onscreen map
with on the fly notes. Saves some paper being printed off.
My binder is huge already.
