Bah, don't feel bad about it.  Not like he didn't have the plat to spare anyway
if he was selling stuff like that.  I think I paid around 300 to 400 for the
pair i got my magician twink.  With all the deals in the bazaar, I had him at
140 INT at level 1.  Whipped through first 8 levels in nothing flat.  He;s not
my main, so he's only level 13 now - he's basically a "play when I am in a bad
mood and just want to mow down everything in sight" character.  Just waiting to
get face, shoulder, back and 1 ring to boost his INT some more.
