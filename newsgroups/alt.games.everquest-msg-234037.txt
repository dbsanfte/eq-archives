I know,  but was simply stating the conditions under which it does
work.

Easy enough, invite him back for free buffs...few idiots would turn
that down. And why should they? What's so dangerous about accepting a
group invite. 

Proceed to debuff  

Even if sends him back to PoK, he loses time, convenience and prolly a
little cash. Kinda the same as he did to the OP...
