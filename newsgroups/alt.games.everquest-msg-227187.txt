LDoN is really good experiance and chanters can get pick up groups fast and
easy. So yeah its worth it.

It doesnt hurt to just go LFG and ask where the camps are when they send you
tells. Ive done that many times in the past. In fact I dont know any camps
in BoT and only one camp in HoH. I havent met a group yet that refused to
help me to them if I needed it.

OT is good at 30. Dawnshroud Peaks is good at 30. Frontier Mountains might
be good too. South Karana might be good at 30.. or was that 20 I forget.
Great Divide is good. Iceclad might be good still. Gulf of Gunthak is
probably good too but less room to kite. Thats all I can think of right now.
