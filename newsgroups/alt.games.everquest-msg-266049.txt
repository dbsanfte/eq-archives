Have you used the Edit button at the top of the recipe window? You can make 
and then save named filters for views based on quite a variety of criteria. 
For example, you could create a view that listed only those recipes from a 
certain book (artisan weapons, artisan leather, escutchen, machanist, etc.) 
or you could list just the interim items from the refined list dealing with 
Alchemy (I call this view Inks). You can filter by recipe level from 1-50, 
or by the knowledge or skill involved. I have a long list of filtered views 
that I use regularly, with names like "Spells 10-19", "Runes 1-9", "Inks", 
etc. Also, you do know that you can sort the views either on Difficulty or 
Alpha, right? To sort alpha, click on the word up top on the left (I forget 
what it is, "Description"? "Name"?), and to sort by difficulty just click on 
the word "Difficulty" up top on the right. If you sort by Difficulty, the 
trivials will start at the top and the Even cons will wind up at the bottom 
and they will be alpha sorted within. If you sort on alpha, everything in 
the view will be sorted in alpha order.

When you get to the edit page, be sure and recognize that there are TWO 
scrollbars. It's easy to miss the big one on the right that controls all the 
granular criteria like books, knowledge, skill, level, etc. I missed this 
entirely at first and discovered it one day while wishing for the kind of 
control that you list above.
