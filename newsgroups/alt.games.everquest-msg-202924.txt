Oh I keep that in mind, and am constantly helping newbies.  I just don't
like when half the group runs off during the middle of a fight when we tell
them we can take them.  Even if the mob is too great, I'm still mezzing so
the others can get away.  I'm sure you've seen a Tork train.. its heck.

Mez and run, mez and run, mez and run...
