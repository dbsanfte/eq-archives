I'm a lvl 11 Ranger and sometimes while traveling I would like to pay for a
SOW or port. How much is a good donation (considering I am lower lvl and
don't have a lot of pp, about 25 at any given time in bank)? I don't want to
be a cheapskate but I also wouldn't want to overspend because I take SO long
to make even that many pp. Thanks.
