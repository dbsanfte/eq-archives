Most people do level at least one character that way and then the alts get
twinked.  Don't know what the situation is for the Uber Cleric though
because if he had a main to twink his cleric you'd think he'd have friends
to play with too.  I guess there are a couple possibilities: 1. He's a noob
that twinked his first ever character by buying plat.  2. He's a noob that
got twinked by a friend that is much to high level to play with him 3. He
twinked his character with plat gained from a main character but he doesn't
have any friends.

I'm kind of guessing 1 or 2 because A. Most experienced players don't even
bother grouping an alt. until around level 20 and if they do, they know that
a lot of noobs are not twinked like them and they don't expect to ONLY play
with twinks. B. Usually don't advertise on the newsgroup.
