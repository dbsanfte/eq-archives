Best, but dated and suxxoring with massive hardware
requirements due to an old engine.
Although old it still has what to me is the most intuitive control
system, which works best for an mmorpg.

Some downtime has been eliminated via the Planes of power
port system as well as the ability to get Clarity three in the Nexus
for a donation (the later was not really planned by the makers and
is possibly a bug which will be fixed in the case of lower players who
must be grouped to get c3)
The game is still suck in dowtime and patience being the main
difficulty modifiers for quests, as well as often needing the help of
many other players who also have stuff they want help with. If you
want nice stuff, you better bring some friends and pack a lunch.

The degree of seperation between the have's and have not's is just too
large. Either you are someone with a bunch of people you play with,
that you manage to cajole into helping you out, or you are a person
busier in real life who plods along getting crumbs and barely
progressing.

The largest problem is probably the staticness of the game, X mob over
here drops X item and X number of people are lined up for it at any
one time. That always seemed backwards to me when a game running on a
computer, by its very nature, has the ability to be insanely random
without a lot of work. Diablo two loot was an example of that in a
smaller game.



>Asherons Call 2

Sucks. Okay to look at but empty feeling world and clumsy control 
system. It really is just "upgraded" asheron's call.


>Dark Age of Camelot

Like Anarchy Online, DAOC made the mistake of having a dubious main
selling point:

"We are not Everquest and don't have downtime!"

That worked for a while, but then you are left with a game without
much soul and content. Tons of people left Everquest to play it, then
tons of them returned. The return ratio of people I knew was around 90
percent.


>Wait For Everquest 2

Pretty much. If you have a system which will play EQ moderately okay,
you are already ready for EQ2. All you need is a non MX card, capable
of pixel and vertex shading and a 750 mhz or up proc as well as 512
meg of memory. So pretty much any geforce 3 and up, leaving out even
the geforce 4 MX, as well as newer ATI cards.

It sounds like it won't make the same mistakes EQ made, with downtime,
while still having the proven content and variety. I won't be playing
it if there is still no real difference in races and if you still need
a global village to help you do quests/get loot. I also won't play it
if its still from the "static mob over here that drops this static
item" school of "get in line now, I'm next! KSER!!!" school of game
design.

Everquest 2 is something like nearly a year away. In the meantime Star
Wars Galaxies looks like the thing to play, though it is delayed once
again.
