50pp seems to be the going price for KEI on EMarr, not that this affects
your argument significantly.  I have never asked for Aego from a cleric.  I
have been the lucky recipient a few times, including on my Enchanter in her
teens.  Most of the time, this is as a result of some kind cleric MGBing it
in Nexus.  I generally don't go around asking for Aego, because it is not
worth what I think I should pay for it based on the reagent plus time for
the cleric.  KEI is well worth the 50pp that it is generally advertised at
in Nexus.
