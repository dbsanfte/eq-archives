Before some of the expansions EQ took a pole and asked everyone whether they
preferred groups or soloing.
They are in the business of making money so Im sure they paid alot of
attention to the results of the poles.  It seems to me that not being a team
player always takes away from the whole rather than adding to it.  I think
most people deep down want to be part of the social struggle and win at that
game.  Also all the advanced raid and guild makes the game so much more
interesting and allows for greater possibilites of advancing the social
complexity and possibilities.  The one flaw I see with eq is the problem of
keeping the players interest.  when it comes down to it the thing we have to
do the most is the thing that is most borring.  Namly the hours we spend
killing the same mobs over and over to level our toons.  So how do you make
the game more interesting.  Im sure there are many ways to do this but the
additional group/raid/guild features add social possibilities to the game
that do add to the interest of the game.
