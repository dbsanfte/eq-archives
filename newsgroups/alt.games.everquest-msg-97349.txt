Hello there..

I have just installed a (cheap) Riva TNT2 M64 graphics card instead of my
on-board Ati Rage. The latter has worked fine until now, but I wanted
something which is at least a bit better than that. Problem is: After I have
installed the new card (w/o any problems) the mouse stops responding within
the first few minutes of EQ play. It works fine outside the EQ environment
(until I has locked up in EQ in which case it stops responding entirely),
and I can still walk around in EQ but with no mouse "options" available,
which, naturally, makes it quite difficult to play the game (no doors, no
direct targeting, etc.).. I have installed the latest available drivers from
nVidia, so I don't know what to do now...

Any suggestions?
