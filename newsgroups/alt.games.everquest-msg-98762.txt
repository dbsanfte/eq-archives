I solo'd level 35 in Najena with a ton of bandages. (real and summoned).
With the con changes since then, the "a skeleton"s in there for the
pally ghoulbane quest will be low blue or light blue, with a fair
dungeon xp bonus. You can easily defeat them one on one and bandage up
afterwards. The rest of the stuff near them won't aggron on you
generally because it's all so green. Just watch where you sit.
