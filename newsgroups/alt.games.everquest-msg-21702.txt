As far as I'm concerned, Ignore is for my convenience, not theirs.  If
someone is deliberately bothering me, I'll tell them I'm Ignoring them so
that they might go away.  If it's just someone spamming the Auction channel
with crap I don't want, I'll just Ignore them so that I can see the other
auctions, and then remove them later.  Both without informing them, since
they weren't specifially trying to bother me.
