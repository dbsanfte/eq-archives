This is something of a misunderstanding.

Hasten doesn't wear the boots.  They don't "disappear."  They were never
there.  His incredible boot-like speed is a result of something else (him
spawning with the buff permenantly on him).  He says they dissappear because
he says he's wearing them.

He doesn't drop the boots... ergo (/roleplay on) they vanished when you
killed him.

Do the quest.
