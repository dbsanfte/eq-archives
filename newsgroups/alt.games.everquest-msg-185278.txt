My old perma-group (most long since retired) were chased out of BWs
by this monkey on our first visit as he seemed completely immune to
snare and root - turns out he is very resistant to magic based spells
so no snare, darkness, fear or root would land.

Luckily the one we ran into didn't summon although the higher spawns
do.
