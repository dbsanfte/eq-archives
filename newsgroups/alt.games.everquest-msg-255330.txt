	The problem is that the content and rewards for solo play suck.

	The shawl quest is a great example of rewarding fun solo/single
group play, especially if you do the collection stuff at an 'appropriate"
level instead of 65.  And the reward itself isn't that great anymore.

	As a solo/single group player I dont' mind - I *want* to - work
for my stuff, but I'd like the opportunity to.  Outside of the same old
boring ldon grind.

	Why do I need to commit to a guild to even get keys and flags
to access stuff so I can raid it?  (rhetorical question)
