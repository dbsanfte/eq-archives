I can't speak to many of the Adept III's because I simply haven't seen many 
of them, but the ones that I have seen make a huge difference and are on 
roughly the same order as the Training-DO-SO ramp. Here's a little more 
breakdown.

You start with Apprentice I, these are given automatically as you reach 
certain points in your level progression (some spells come at the ding, 
others at ding.5 etc). You can then buy upgrades from NPCs to Apprentice II. 
These are modest upgrades at a modest price. Players can craft Apprentice 
IIIs and these represent a much bigger ramp up over App II than App II 
represents over App I. The vast majority of my crafting business and wealth 
has derived from selling App III scrolls to players moving from App I to my 
App III's. Frankly, most skip the App II stage and jump right to III. I 
would estimate that only 50-75% of the player population has upgraded their 
skills (this becomes really apparent when you're grouped with a tank that's 
still using Taunt App I), and of those players who have upgraded, the big 
majority are using App IIIs, with maybe 30% using Adept I and maybe 5% using 
Adept IIIs.

Adept I's drop from mobs and there's a good market in them. People sell them 
(I have two on my vendor at the moment) or will often hold them in trade for 
an Adept I of their type. I have never seen an Adept II, and again players 
can craft Adept IIIs if they find the rare component that's required for 
them.

The rares are found mining rocks in the various zones. Chances of finding a 
rare have been estimated at something on the order of 500-1. Are the results 
500 times better? No. But they're appreciably better in combat and are worth 
striving for. My current base stats:

HP = 605
Power = 506
AC = 446 (ok I have crappy gear)

I didn't take notes on what Daring Apprentice I did for me, but I recall it 
being on the order of 610, 510, 500. With Daring Adept III, which is a group 
buff, my numbers go to 626, 523, 666. Note the huge AC increase. With Ursine 
Elder, Auspice, Spirit of the Bull and Daring Adept III, I wind up at 852, 
588, 666.

Scrolls are skill based, and you can upgrade to any level once you have the 
requisite skill. This skill based system is probably designed to limit 
twinkage of gear and in practice the requirements for scrolls is very 
minimal so anyone who has a spell or combat art can jump up immediately to 
the Adept III. Master I's are starting to drop now and I haven't seen any 
Master II's nor do I have any recipes for Master IIIs. I suspect they will 
be the province of the Sage, but the one Sage that I know on our server 
(level 23 Sage) has not yet seen them either.
