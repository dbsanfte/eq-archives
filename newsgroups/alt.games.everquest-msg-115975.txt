Usually I'm in agreement with the dislike of words like "plz" or any sort
of d00d speak, but in the case of "mob" and "toon", they don't bother me
in the least.

I use mob frequently, and toon rarely, mostly in the context of, "don't worry,
it's just a toon" when someone is mourning the death of my character, loss
of xp, or some nice equipment.  Since most people do not roleplay, I'm
surprised that anyone is surprised and dismayed by the usage of these terms.

On the same subject, how many people dislike these terms:

"loot"  (let alone lewt)
"drop"

others?
