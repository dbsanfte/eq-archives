No reason at all to put the word <gifts> in quotations marks. She lost a
younger brother to malnutrition during the same period the cat was feeding
her. She was very sickly as a child to and had no access to doctors or any
"luxuries" like that. I have no reservations in saying the cat proberly
figured just as much in her survival (regular source of protein) as her
parents did.

Rural Thai's get very practical about child rearing when resources get
tight - it all get's concentrated into the oldest children who have the
greater chance of repaying the debt in a quicker time frame. She didn't even
get to go to school <at all> whilst both older siblings did.

We tend to take a fair bit for granted in our relatively wealthy countries.
