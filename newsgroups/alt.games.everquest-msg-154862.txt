IMO the biggest broken feature in the game right now is
autofollow.  There's a *long* list of things which
are *very* wrong with it.  Off the top of my head:

1.  It's way too easy to end up "orbiting" the person
you're attempting to autofollow while they're standing
still.

2.  Once you're orbiting, if the person you're following
starts to head out, odds are they'll end up "out of range"
before you swing back around close enough to them to
start properly following them.

3.  Related to orbiting, it takes too long to curve
around to match back up with the person you're following
whenever you get slightly off track.  Like #2, you often
end up losing the person due to the time it takes you
to "swing" back to face them.

4.  Autofollowing flickers your walk/run mode on and off.
When you finish autofollowing, much of the time you're
left in "walk" mode and have to manually toggle "run"
back on again.  This has gotten me killed several times.

5.  There are a host of problems caused by the fact
that when you don't have line-of-sight to the person
you're following (or starting to follow), you run in
a straight line in whatever direction you're currently
facing.  It didn't used to work this way, I think they
added that "feature" in order to make following through
twisty dungeon passages work (somewhat) better.  It's
semi-useful there, but broken as shit elsewhere, maybe
they should let you toggle that behavior on/off in
the options screen.  Problems with "run straight if
you can't see him":

   5a.  If you can't see the person you're trying to
   start to follow (i.e. he's behind a tree, or over
   a bump in the terrain), when you hit /af you'll
   run 50 yards in whatever direction you're facing,
   stop, and get the "too far away" message.  This is
   not only useless, it's counter-productive (now you
   *really* have to hunt him down), and often quite
   dangerous.  Plus it gives an erroneous idea about
   what direction your leader is.

   5b.  Similarly, if you're successfully following
   and your leader runs around a tree or over the
   crest of a hill, you'll go running away in a
   straight line until a) he pops back into view
   again (if he ever does) -- at which time the problem
   in #3 is likely to screw you over, or b) you wander
   far enough off track that you get the wonderful
   "he's too far away" message again and you grind
   to a halt in the middle of nowhere.

And so on.  I two-box and use autofollow a lot, and
am *constantly* getting screwed by autofollow.

All the problems above could be easily fixed by:

A.  Remove or minimize the "curve radius" -- just
have anyone autofollowing swing instantly to face
their leader at all times, or if they have to follow
a curve for technical reasons, curve at maximum
speed (i.e., as fast as you can pivot your character
using the left-right arrow keys).

B.  Whenever the game gives the "you are no longer
autofollowing" message, have it restore your default
run/walk status (or whatever your run/walk status
was when you started /af).

C.  Allow the user to toggle on/off the "run straight
if no line of sight to leader" option.  Or at least
make it active only in indoor zones -- it sucks in
bumpy or tree-filled outdoor zones.

D.  If you can't see your leader, have an attempt
to /af fail immediately, instead of sending you running
off at random.

E.  It would also help if the "out of range" radius
were increased about 25-50%, this would give autofollow
more time to recover from fumbles, instead of almost
instantly leaving you stranded.
