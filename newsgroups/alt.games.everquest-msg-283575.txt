everquest2-- What's In Live Update #24? --www.igametc.com
 Glad you asked. Live Updated 24 was posted today with some changes to
gameplay within the WoW realms. The first and biggest piece of news to
come out of this update is that The Fallen Dynasty adventure pack is
now available for players to pick up. Picking up the adventure pack now
will allow players to access a new area and get their very own bonsai
tree.

Other gameplay changes involve the tradesman skill, betrayal and
exiles, PvP exiles, a new consignment system, Norrathian Exploration,
The Commonlands and much, much more! If you want a full list of all the
updates that have been added, check out the list here.
