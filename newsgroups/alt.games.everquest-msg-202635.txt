I don't know if you are just a troll or if you really are a whiny

constructive advice though.  AC2.  You want a game with zero downtime no 
  matter how little effort you put into attaining that objective and EQ 
is just not that game.  AC2 on the other hand is.  There you can wait 
mere seconds after a fight, even solo, and be back at full strength 
ready to fight.

I find it boring as all hell after the first few hours because of this 
feature, but from your comments in this thread I think it would be 
perfect for you.  You seem way too caught up in telling us that EQ 
should be designed for you to play rather than considering that maybe 
you need to find a game that is actually designed for your style.  If 
you genuinely dislike the premise of EQ (grouping/tactics required to 
reduce downtime), then don't play it, find a game that is designed for 
your style.
