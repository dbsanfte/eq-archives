Imagine you're not Willy B and have just entered the thread.  Is it easier
to understand this post, or the one with this paragraph at the top?

Yes, top posting is easier on the respondent...bottom posting is easier on
the reader and I don't know about you, but I prefer to make things as easy
as possible for anyone who takes time out of their day to read my words.

Why it's the standard here, I have no clue.  Most of my other groups that I
read are top-post and I top-post when I'm there, despite the fact it makes
it harder to read.
