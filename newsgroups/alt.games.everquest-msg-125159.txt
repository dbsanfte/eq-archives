I play EQ now for about 3 months and have printed out every map and info
(eqatlas) of the zone I have been in and plan to go to in the near future.
Also got all in the info about Druids (my main) and Paladins (my alt). Also
got some prices and item info.
I have a large size binder with about 150 pages currently occupated. I know
it's not so big but its the largest manual I have started for a game.
