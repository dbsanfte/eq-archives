Bad analogy...TV's too easy to check.  The addictiveness of a game isn't
nearly so easy, and that's what I'm talking about.

The only way they'd know for sure is to play the game and get past the
learning curve.  I imagine most people who don't play a lot of games give up
not long after they figure out how to get out of their starting city (if
they ever do) and figure "huh.  Well, the kid can have it if he wants, but I
think it sucks."

I think that doing google searches, praying for testimonials, reading the
game's website (no good info there in this case), checking out the game's
newsgroup (if they knew what newsgroups were)...it's unreasonable to expect
a parent to have to do 5+ hours of research on a GAME.

At that point it's ridiculous...put a damned warning on the box.  Obviously
the parent is STILL responsible, as unfair as that might be.
