Hmmm....there's only one guild on my server that I know of that is probably
Time capable (there are one or two other guilds that *might* be capable, but
I doubt it). Guess I'll try asking someone from that guild.

And I've heard about that Monk weapon, but haven't actually seen it yet. It
sounds like one I'll definitely be taking a pic of. (I have an alt that's a
Monk)

If anyone who reads this sees the weapon I've described, or that Monk
weapon, PLEASE take a pic and post it somewhere. I want to shots of them
both.
