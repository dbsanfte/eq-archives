Hey all,

I was just wondering if anyone else has ever had/has this problem.  I
recently installed EQ on my new machine, it has a SBLive! Value in it.  When
the music plays sometimes it loops until I move the mouse or move my
character.  I'll hear the battle music and then it'll just loop, the game
plays fine the whole time, I get no lock ups or freezes, but the music can
get very annoying after awhile.  Anyone ever have this experience? Any
solutions?

Thanks!
