> Head, Savants cap (my obvious choice would be Runed circlet)

zaharns coronet is a cheap alternative to a runed circlet.

> Wrists, Studded leather (RMB's I guess)

At early levels I like the vox bracers. Cheap and good ac.
Laster on when you need the wis, pbb, cbb are cheap alternatives to the rmb.

> Legs, Leather (not sure, maybe ES if I can geta  good price)

Gatorscale are ok if you just want to buy something cheap.

> Feet, Kobold Hide boots (Gebs but  a little pricey for what I want)

dwarven work boots are ok for early levels with dot/thorns. Dont have
anything to suggest here for wis.

> Back Leather cloak (from what I've seen most good wis cloaks are high
cost,

I used cloak of the icebear until I upgraded to a mammoth cloak.

Read up on the FM cycle and go get yerself a medicine totem. You may want a
partner to take Blugtigin down. He goes down easily, but he hurts.
