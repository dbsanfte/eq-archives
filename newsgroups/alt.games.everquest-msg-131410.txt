Well, as an alternative to continuing to say negative things about
one another while repeating minor variations on the same arguments
over and over, let me try a different tack.

First, I'll <snip the whole ugly, ungainly mess>, and now I'll
attempt to present my position briefly, clearly, and devoid of
pejorative comments:

First, I find /tell to be a more courteous alternative to /shout and
/ooc, when /tell suffices.  This, to me, is analogous to comparing
a private aside directed at a single person instead of shouting across
dozens of people at a social gathering.  And EQ is and always has been
a social gathering in the form of a game, I remember statements to the
effect that making melees/hybrids dependent on casters for Bind
Affinity was explicitly intended to encourage social interaction under
TheVision(tm).

Second, I see the telemarketer analogy as a strawman.  It
mischaracterizes the social gathering that is EQ as a completely
different animal.

Finally, whatever else you, I, or a_usenet_poster_99 might have to say,
this discussion seems pretty certain to have no discernable effect on
the player community.  I say this because it is that very player
community that has quite rigorously trained me and, presumably, most
any other observant person, to behave as I do:
"When desiring an exchange of favors (buff for buff, pp for buff, &
etc.), if possible identify a character that is capable of doing what
you desire who is not currently engaged in combat and send that toon
a polite /tell proposing whatever it is you want.  If there is no
response or a negative response move on without attempting further
communication."
I say that I have been trained because (1) attempts made over public
channels routinely fail, while (2) using this method routinely
succeeds, and (3) I've been further rewarded with new in-game friends
first met via this sort of exchange.  This goes both ways btw, although
I've not yet gotten past 21 with any caster, my main's 50 percent rez
seems to be considered a good deal by quite a few folk (aside: I have
never refused a rez request whether compensation was offerred/received
or not).

Hmm, not as brief as I would have liked, but hopefully clear enough.
Flame away if you like, I don't think I've got anything else to say
on the subject.

Kaev
