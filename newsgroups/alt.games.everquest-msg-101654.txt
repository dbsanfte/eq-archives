Somebody already posted the PnP relating this, I trust you found it and
don't need me to re-post it...

Theres a BIG difference between telling somebody where to play, and telling
an annoying little shit to get the hell away from your raid.   So you think
it would be ok to follow a guild into nToV, a guild that does NOT want you
there, a guild that has ASKED you to leave, and a place you could NOT get to
alone if it weren't for that guild clearing the way.

> How about if I proclaim <my>self the leader and tell <him> to get the fuck
away?

With your attitude, I think you'd have a tough time having anybody follow
you, let alone a whole guild

> You sound like an idiot.

Right, thanks for clearing that one up.

> that. I'm adding lag to the thirty people sitting there?

Your adding extra lag, on top of the needed number of forces already there
to kill the mob, yes.

> How about people simply passing through Kael? Or do you expect the
> entire zone to be shut down for your convenience? Get fucking serious.

No you "get fucking serious". Theres a difference between people in the
other side of the zone/running through the zone, and people stood right by
your raid.

If you'd like me to point out on a map where Tormax, Vindi, Statue and AoW
spawn/are fought, I can... don't give me bullshit about "people running
through the zone" or wanting the zone closed, when you obviously have NFC
how and where we kill these targets, and how the other people don't effect
the raid to the same extend that dumbass leaches like you do.

Whos talking about entry giants?  Im sorry if we can't handle Tormaxes loot
within 2 minutes that you think its up for grabs, because you would be
petitioned and labeled a ninja scum pos if you took something.

Rezzing the dead, getting the item stats, informing the non-guild attendees,
taking tells on the loot, officers deciding winners etc all takes a lot
loner then 2 minutes

And what happens when the loot winner wasn't in the exp group, does their
loot become open to everybody, because they had to wait the 2 minutes for
the corpse to open?  Yeah right

The 10th war quest head was ninja'd by an unguilded low level enchanter.
The Lodi shield was also ninjad by a cleric not in our guild.  I don't know
who took the Itraer Vius loot...

Id like to quote you now, as I think this is pretty appropriate for you

"You sound like an idiot."

That shit doesn't even deserve a response.

To correct you on a few more things, nope im not the kind of person that is
the one to tell them to get away from our raids, its not something I've ever
done.

I've asked other guilds if they wanted help/if I could join them for faction
etc, if they say no then fine - I leave, if not then great.  We've been
FCFS'd in ST, and after running all that way, deciding I don't really want
to run back again, I've asked the other guild if they want another monk to
tag along, and it's been fine.

In most cases we have no problem with people "tagging along" on our raids,
our last vindi killing had a group or so of an opposition guild who came to
grab a faction hit (not a guild were on great terms with either) but that
was fine.

To us Vindi is trivial and we can deal with extra lag/somebody non-guilded
doing something wrong etc...  if were clearing nToV though, thats a totally
different story.  If they aren't with us and refuse to leave, im quite sure
my guild leader would petition to have them removed.

Nobody has stooped as low as you indicate you would though, and tried to
wurm their way into our nToV raid, the only time we've really had to take
action was during a 10th ring war.

If your not familiar with the war, there are certain 'heroes' who you can
control (to get npc dorf reinforcements), and if all 4 are still alive at
the end of the war you get bonus loot from each of them, theres also a dorf
who has to be kept alive for the quest to work (as well as preventing any
giants from reaching Thurgadin)

Anyway members of an opposition guild came into GD, and proceeded to kill
the dorfs, it was just spitefulness basically.

They were asked to leave, "its a free country.. i can go where i like"  "im
on giant faction, i can kill any dorfs i want"

No actually dipshit, its interfering with a quest, and interfering with a
raid.
Within 5 minutes of the gm's there (for some reason 2 came) the people were
out of the zone.

If theres a genuine reason for asking somebody to move away from your raid,
I don't see ANY counter argument, and in every instance the GM's will action
YOU, not the raid.
