Having grown up in a terrorism-ridden country, I have first hand 
knowledge of the fact that it certainly isn't.

Oh, I've already mentioned (in the same post you have replied to, in 
fact) that I will be very glad myself to see Saddam go, but I still 
believe that oil is the one element that determines that Saddam is going 
to get squashed like a bug while North Korea will most likely *benefit* 
from all this noise, and extract some sweet aid deals from negotiators.

And no, I don't think the US will "confiscate" Iraq's oil. Turning Iraq 
into a friendly regime that can weight in on OPEC would probably be 
beneficial enough to US economic interests to justify a war, especially 
a quick and easy one like this.

I should think that after 9/11 the US would do better actually *learning* 
to make fine distinctions and familiarize itself with all the nuances 
and subtleties of foreign policy that it has ignored so far, rather than 
resorting to the blunderbuss approach. Divide and conquer, and all that.

There's two facts here that sour public opinion on this war, apart from 
the oil issue: The biggest supporters and financers of the people 
responsible for 9/11 are currently in countries that are nominal allies 
of the US, *and* the US has long been a supporter of terrorist 
organizations and "rogue" states (not least, Saddam Hussein himself) 
when and where it has suited its political or economic interests. 
Because of this, public perception in the rest of the world is that 9/11 
is not so much the reason for this war, as the excuse.

On top of this, if we're talking *exclusively* about the fight against 
terrorism, the insignificant gains of getting rid of Saddam (I really 
don't think he's financing a lot of terrorism at the moment) are offset 
by the fact that this war will be used as a rallying cry by those 
terrorist organizations, and large numbers of potential recruits who are 
wavering at the moment may be radicalized enough to actually join them. 
This is *not* a good thing. 

Of course, sometimes you have to just do the right thing and radicals be 
damned, as in Afghanistan, but in the particular case of Iraq, I think 
there is more to be lost than to be gained from the point of view of the 
US's own safety.

Again, all this does not mean I oppose the war. I think it will benefit 
Iraq the same way the war in Afghanistan benefited the Afghan people.

I couldn't agree more.
