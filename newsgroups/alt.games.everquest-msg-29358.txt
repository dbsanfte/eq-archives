I'm a level 16 druid who has been using a full set of leather armor
since level 5, but now I'm really getting whumped in battle.  Plat is
a problem too, as I've spent a lot on spells and  a slightly better
weapon.  I can save up, but I probably need to be looking for
something in the low hundreds, if I want to get it soon.

What do you reccommend for me and where do you think I should go to
find it?
