And I see no attempt to understand my position in any of his posts.
Further, his remark is plainly insulting in context, regardless of
intent.  Of course, sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and
my "group of morons" comment in the previous post is also insulting
in context.

Thoughtfully accomodating that sort of variety is a big part of
courtesy.  When and where I grew up, it was normal to emphasize
something you said by starting it with "Boy!" or "Boy oh boy!",
as in "Boy! it sure is hot out here!" (I've encountered "man" in
place of "boy" elsewhere).  Imagine how that figure of speech
went over the first time I used it speaking to a black kid from
the south when I went to boot camp.

I am of the opinion that he was, in fact, being deliberately
insulting, even though he may not have thought of it in those
terms.  I've encountered (and used) "insane" in similar contexts
many times.  Among friends it's the sort of insult that's often
taken for granted.  Among strangers you're being foolish (or
ignorant, I suppose) if you use it without being prepared for a
reaction.
