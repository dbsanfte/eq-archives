A new guild called The Fellowship is being created by a good friend of
mine - a forum has been setup on
http://pub69.ezboard.com/bthefellowship88775 . The guild is there for
fun and enjoyment, and to help our members on quests and things. You
say you don't want an uber guild, so that should be just fine. Please
note that the guild hasn't actually been created in-game yet!

Its not specifically UK based, but English is the guild language and
there are UK members (me for example!). Membership is by invitation,
but if you are interested then you are welcome to post on the forum
and we can try to arrange for you to meet up with some of us in-game
to see that we all get on well together.

With regard to the other posts, The Wyrd Angles also looks to be a
fine guild that would meet your needs. I nearly asked to join them,
but then we decided to build our own guild :) The choice, as they say,
is yours.

Regards,

Goldark
The Fellowship
Shaman of the 24th Spririt on Antonius Bayle
