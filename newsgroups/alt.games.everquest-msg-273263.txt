I went and asked someone who was a deputy sheriff. He told me that I
had forgotten something. That the police can and have taken people
in, and held them for 1-2 days, the amount of time differs by
jurisdiction, without charging them with anything. No claim they
have broken the law. Its Constitutional. Usually its used to hold
someone for questioning if the police think that person knows
something about a crime or might be involved in a crime that is
being investigated. But sometimes the cop will just haul someone in.
Of course, after the end of the time period, they have to charge
them or let them go. And its all perfectly legal. And its in this
time period, and has been in use for at least 75 years. Probably
longer. So if someone tells you that you cannot be held without
trial, or without being charged with a crime, they are totally
wrong.
