I personally never accused Bush senior of idiocy.  I disagreed with many of his
policies, and think he grossly mismanaged the endgame on the Iraq war, but never
for one moment doubted his intelligence nor his savvy.  Selecting young Dan as a
running mate even looked smart, since you had in that a very nice bit of
protection from the domestic assassin; I doubt there was a single right wing OR
left wing lackey in america who would have prefered Mr. Quayle in the oval
office.  He also made a fine distraction whenever political issues started to
look ugly.

Contrast this with my latest diatribe against "W"... having Danny Boy appear the
fool may have been one of the shrewdest political ploys in recent memory.
Genuine or not, he certainly performed admirably in the function of  scapegoat.
