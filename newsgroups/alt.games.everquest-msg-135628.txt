There were some major changes to the hybrid classes, including SK's.
Here's a list of the sk changes I recall:

Added life tapping spell lines

reduced mana cost of spells - same cost as straight casters now I
believe

eliminated delay affect of spell casting during melee. Spell casting
does not stop weapon recycle timer.

Not sure, but I've heard that feign death is somewhat less effective
than it used to be. Not sure about this though.

High level disciplines added (these were added to all melee classes).

I think harm touch was given a better resist table.

Some new spells added.

Their pets don't unsummon when crossing zones.

They get cool pet buffing spells that can be used to buff up a charmed
NPC animal to ridiculous level. Kinda useless, but fun to set lose a
level 40 young lion on the newbies.

Highly pet dependent, but get pretty nice pets.

Can't tank well, but can turn out some decent melee damage.
