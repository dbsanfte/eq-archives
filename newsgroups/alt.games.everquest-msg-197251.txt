I don't have the problems you describe, except that a few maps either have only a  few
lines on them, or the lines are invisible in the default texture.

And I don't have a clue how to change the texture.

What I'd really like is a way to make the map practically transparent, so I don't have
to turn it on and off or move it around in an effort to see around the map in case
there's a dangerous mob or something in my way.

I certainly find the maps annoying and flawed.. but I find them a vast improvement
over no map, or the artistically and (is this a word?) Informationally more complete
EQAtlas maps, since these are interactive; my exact position is constantly updated on
them, I can scale them up or down as needed to see detail or long view, and its easy
to see what direction I should head to get to my destination.

I need to learn how to manipulate them better, so I can deal with multilevel dungeons
without being buried in every single level stacked together.

I also need to figure out something someone else was talking about that would allow
them to mark a path on a map automatically; I could bring in a high level or non KOS
toon and mark out a route that a low level or "running fast before invis fades" alt
could then follow.

Also, I need to develop a vocabulary for explaining directions when we are both on the
same map; or better yet, find a way of imposing grids on the maps, preferably in scale
with the Loc system.

SO I think maps (and my use of them) have a long way to go, but this is a quantum leap
in useability.
