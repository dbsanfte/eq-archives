}erm... why on EARTH are people saying enchanters for a highly desired
}raid class. Unless you're doing one of a couple of REALLY high end mobs
}(eg: VT, Emp) more than a couple of enchanters could be replaced by any
}number of classes. Enchanters are one of only a few classes who REALLY
}need some endgame raid boosts, especially as they aren't compensated by
}above norm soloing ability.

Woot!  I'm a-gettin' a 50% manaburn, ain't I? :)

Ooo.  AA ability: Complete Mana Seive.  That'd be pretty sweet.  No spells 
for j00!

But really, I'll settle for Illusion: Gender.  It was even in the spdat 
for a while there!
