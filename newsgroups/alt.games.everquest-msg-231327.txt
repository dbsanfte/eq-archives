This what instanced dungeons are good for. What do you care if Bonehead 
the monk is farming zombie skins or whatever... he's got his own instance.

The whole game shouldn't be instanced... but lowbies should have some 
neat dungeons just for them, and it would make it a lot more interesting 
to zone into even crushbone with your group of level 7s... and find 
something in the zone alive to kill... without a 'helpful' 57th level 
druid buffing the crap out of you so that you couldn't die if you 
trained the whole zone...
