Well, when you grow up, you'll come to understand (benefit of the
doubt here) a little thing we in the know like to call "economics".
You know, like maybe when you start paying for your own games and

not having to carry around a pre-paid calling card for calling your
folks to come pick you up later. Maybe then. Until then, go away.
