So far...

I can see that...

However, what happens when the CHILD takes the next logical step and
asks??

All those examples do not have the sexual connection that HIV and AIDs
does.

Because there is an added component to AIDs (the sexual angle) that is
not applicable in the examples you give.

If it could be done that way, I would agree.  But I DO recall one
thing about kids at that age.  They are insatiably curious.

I just don't see the rhyme nor reason to introducing something to a
child that cannot be explained fully.

And, as I said before, it definetly does not belong in the purview of
a show such as SS...
