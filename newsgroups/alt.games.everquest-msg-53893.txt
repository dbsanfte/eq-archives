Well as to your cheeky remark at spending more time learning English Bizbee,
I have to point out that it is you that speaks english Slang! due to the
fact that your not even English Lol, anyways I havent got time for this I
got better things to do, & thats not so say I'm playing everquest!  far from
it, I'm off to sleep considering its like 2:40am & some people actually
work!

One other thing, the thought that you had to give such a leary reply makes
me even more happier that I actually worte it, just goes to show the type of
people that write on these boards, idiot.  =)

Regards,
