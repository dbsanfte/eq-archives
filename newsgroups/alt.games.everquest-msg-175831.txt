As a lvl 62 enchanter, fighting mobs in POV, I much prefer a paladin or
shadow knight to do the tanking, especially if Im on slows. It makes the
difference between being able to tash and slow straight away, vs having to
wait about 12 seconds. If the war is a bit flimsy, those 12 seconds can be
scary. Paladins do it with their stun spells, SK's with darkness I think.
