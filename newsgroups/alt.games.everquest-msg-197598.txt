I understand your point with this last, but if the individual played a
druid to 52, then he could conceivably have soloed his way the whole
way - I have other dr00d friends who have done so.  In that case, this
person might never have run into a pure caster before and might be
unaware that only priest classes and priest-hybrids can heal PCs.  As
for pets....well, some pure casters do get pet heals, so it's not that
far-fetched to ask why the enchanter can't; the only answer I can
think of is that the basic enchanter summoned pet isn't like a real
pet - it seems mostly to be meant to give the enchanter a chance to
run. :)
