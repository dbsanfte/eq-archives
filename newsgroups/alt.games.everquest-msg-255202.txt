For 2 hand weapons, that is not true, the damage bonus is based on the 
delay of the weapon and your level.  So, a 40/40 weapon may actually be 
better than a 40/39 weapon even with the same haste.

For 1 hand weapons, so long as the damage is the same, then, yes, the 
lower delay is better.  But, if you compare a 10/10 weapon to a 20/20 
weapon, by your logic they would be the same, but, they are not.  The 
damage bonus is identical based strictly on level, so, the faster weapon 
is better.  In fact, often a weapon with a worse ratio is actually the 
better weapon, particularly at higher levels where the damage bonus gets 
to be large.

What you do need to consider, when choosing a weapon for yourself, is 
what your haste is normally when you fight, as that along with your 
damage bonus with the various weapons can affect which weapon is best.

Agreed, that would be a silly way to compare weapons in general.
