I have similarly had no luck.
Apparently he appears somewhere neer Peg leg's camp,
Then progresses to the old tower with the Elf in it.
Then walks up to the single standing stone by the road to the docks
Finally he goes to the dock.

I have spent a short time looking for him and not found him.

Cheers,

Jem (Kendred)
