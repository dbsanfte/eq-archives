Glad you made it.  It was an adventure for me too when I made a first
crossing.  Now a days PoP book makes too easy to move around.  That took
some of the fun out of the game.

WK is a large zone.  When I traverse WK I usually go along the river.  There
are all kinds of wandering creature by the road and that make it hard
crossing.  I did not try it until when I was mid lvl 20's.  Now a day I swim
along the river along southern part of WK zone.  It is a good place to get
your swimming skills up, and there are no creatures.  There are some quests
I need to accomplish still.  But that requires lots of swimming in the
ocean.  Even though my swimming skill is up over 180, I am still afraid to
do the ocean quest or visit islands.  Bottom of an ocean is a hell of a
place to loose your body!

Emilio.
