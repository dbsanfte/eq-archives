I think you'll find PoP more useful myself. The rapid transit it
introduced is pretty much considered the norm these days - as is the raid
channel. 

As to the others - I'd lean to LoY myself, unless dungeoneering is
something you want to do lots of an are prepared to sit waiting for
adventures or have a big bunch of guildmates to play in there with. Again
in that case I'd still suggest PoP be the top of the list.
