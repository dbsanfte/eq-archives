I personally don't think it is viable due to fact somepeople such as I,
leave my backpack in the backseat and it often weighs as much as a child
thusly would set off your new stupidity sensors. Or what about people who
put bags for grociers and boxes there and go get more shopping done?

And as for alarms/horns?
When was the last time you saw anyone take a car alarm seriously?

just my little thoughts
