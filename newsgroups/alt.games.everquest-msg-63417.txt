 Yeah im begining to realize my role as a group shaman...which is totally
different when im soloin....i sometimes feel like im holding back since i know
what kinda of massive damage i can do now at lvl 40...well maybe not
massive...but holy shit....lvl 49 is going to be sweeeeet !!! E bolt
wooohooo!!! Playing a shaman is almost like have a spilt personality....in
groups as you said supportive caster..buff slow malise...haste if no
chanter..and <sigh> sow....in solo...totally all out killing machine...it is
good to have the option to do either. Shamans Rock!
