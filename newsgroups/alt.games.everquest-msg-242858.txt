Grats on that nice bow!

Vendors will sell the arrows - for example the fletching vendor in EC
hidden inn has them (Damage1 Range50), but if you can afford to skill
up your fletching to about 60-ish you can make your own much better
arrows. Damage1 Range150 arrows are best for pulling (cheapest point,
cheapest shaft, parabolic fletch and small groove nock). See
www.eqtraders.com for tips on skilling up fletching - you'll only need
about 40-50pp to get it that far.
