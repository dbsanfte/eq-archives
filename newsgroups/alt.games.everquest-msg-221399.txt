It's a case of, for the most part, pickup groups are really, really stupid.

It's a perfect example of groupthink.   The idiots tell each other things
that they only half understand, stereotypes and "my buddy told me" becomes
"proof" that druids can't heal, even though his buddy is as much of an idiot
as him, and is only parroting what he heard from still more idiots.

Groups have just repeated "druids can't heal" often enough that most of them
believe it.   And sadly, they seem to have even convinced a lot of druids of
it.  They "know" that there is no way they can be the main healer, so they
refuse to let themselves be put in that situation.   Which then becomes even
more "proof" that they can't handle it.   "Look, even the druid says druids
can't be main healers... and he would know, he plays the class and you
don't"

The truth is that druids can sub in for a cleric at almost all levels.
There are only really a very few levels where their spells lag far enough
behind that they can't keep up.   Right around 50 is a tough time, when the
druid has not yet recieved Superior Heal, and can only heal 300 points, mobs
can do that in a couple of swings, so the druid would have to chain cast his
little heal.   Right before level 58 is another tough time, a druid is
limited to Superior for 600 healing, or Chloroblast for 450, while tank hit
points are getting to the level that it's silly to use anything except
Complete Heal.   But once they get thier 58 complete heal spell, that can
take them all the way to 65 as the main healer.


I've had groups where idiots turned down a ranger who was looking for group
on the basis of him being "low dps"... then went and added a paladin in the
final slot.  Tremendously stupid, but theres not much you can say when the
idiots outnumber you three to one...    (I really hate being so group
dependent.   All too often, it's take a group with stupid people, or sit
around doing nothing for a couple hours.)

Actually, "Rangers can't tank" is another example of the same phenomenon.
Theres literally nowhere outside of PoP that I would hesitate to use a
ranger tank, if that is what was available.   But the whole "Rangers take so
much more damage, and require so much more healing" mantra has been repeated
so often that even the rangers believe it.   They don't realize they can
tank just fine, because they never try it.
