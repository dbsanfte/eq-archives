A good source of easy money is Qeynos newbie grounds.

Kill all the snakes you see, the jawbones and the kig snake skin (or scales
forget which) sell for 2gp each, while this isnt really on par with the
aquas of BBM its do-able from lvl 1 onwards and all the items stack and are
common drops.

Oh and as soon as you feel able head over to the gnolls in (or if you want
to play it safe Outside) of Blackburrow, the Gnolls bones and some of the
pelts also sell for 2gp each, plus you willl make good exp and dont forget
to keep those Gnoll fangs.
