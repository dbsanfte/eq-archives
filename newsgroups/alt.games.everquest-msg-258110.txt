It will look "fine".

No.

That would depend very highly on what 'everybody else' is using.=) A 
ti4600, quite frankly is still ahead of the curve in installed systems. 
Its obsolete by new PC standards (ie you'd never buy one today), but 
there are a gazillion geforce2s, 3s, and geforce4mxes out there that 
will not be upgraded for some time to come.

More importantly the ti4600 despite not having support for some of the 
new vaunted dx9 features are much more powerful than entry level modern 
ati and nvidia cards that *are* being dumped into new systems by the 
truckloads. (I've said numerous times that I'd rather have ti4600 over a 
5200FX, despite the 5200 supporting the 'new features')

You will see some more subtle effects (eye candy), and better (faster) 
fsaa.

If cash is at all an issue, I'd wait another generation of graphics 
cards to upgrade. By then you will see marked improvement. Upgrading 
from a ti4600 to a 9800 is sort of like going from a Pentium III 1000 to 
a Pentium 4 1.40. Faster yes (but not as much as you'd think, and 
nowhere near the 40% you'd expect), extra features yes... but worth the 
$$$.  Hardly.

Moreover your system, while not dated, isn't top of the line, and to 
really get a big boost out of the newest graphics cards you need the 
rest of the system to back it up.

To sum up, while the 9800 would be an upgrade for you, I don't think its 
going to be worth it. 

At the very least, wait until EQ2 actually comes out, and buy the card 
then, when the price will have been pushed down yet a little more, and 
the value proposition will be greater.

Nothing is dumber than buying in advance of the application. The card 
will just spin its wheels and depreciate while you wait for the game to 
show up.

Finally like I said, your system is starting to get dated as a cutting 
edge gamers rig. Depending on your upgrade cycle you may want to hold 
off on a new AGP card, if you think you'll build a new system in the 
coming year, with pci express etc... then why bother investing in an agp 
card your going to leave behind.
