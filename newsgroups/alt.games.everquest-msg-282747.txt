Somewhat twinked.  Best piece of gear is his sword so no defensive
help there.  Otherwise it's all drop loot or cheap bazaar items.  I do
have a guildie made Velium Chestplate but that's the most twinked
piece on him.

Never been PL'd technically, but our group dishes out so much damage
that we level pretty fast.  It's an all DPS group and we rip through
stuff quickly.  Other than that no high level druids or anything like
that, just fast killing.

I hit 89 the other night on defense at level 45.  ARGH!
