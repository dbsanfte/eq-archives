Thing is, while it could do with more, it doesn't really need much
more customization. After a point, customization is fluff. Who's going
to notice that your eyes tilt 2 degrees more than the other guys? Or
your eyes are a shade lighter? Hell, most people don't even notice eye
color on other people's characters 'til you're right in their face. My
only request would be some more faces and hair styles... Possibly more
"jewelry" and even some on the males.
