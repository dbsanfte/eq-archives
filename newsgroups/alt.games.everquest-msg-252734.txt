Why not Feign Death as an AA ability?

Give a non-fding class a non-trainable skill,that you could raise
by using.A lot of Druids and Rangers would be pleased.

And in general,why not trivialize the game more ?
Kei,ressurection,slow, haste,etc., yeah give it 
to everyone !   ;)

Maybe you should try Morrowind,nice single player rpg,
and you can learn every skill with just your very own char!
No need to deal with other annoying players,isnt it great?  :)
