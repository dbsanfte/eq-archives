In about 10-20 years or so when we are in our VR suits playing games like VR
EQ and "living" the game to think back about how archaic EQ was.  I recall
Bard's Tale being the best thing since sliced bread in the 80's... and
cringe now to think how static and dull it would be today.

You will be telling your grandkids... "Why in my day, we read reams of text
scrolling by while staring at the inside of our spellbooks and spent
countless hours doing it."
