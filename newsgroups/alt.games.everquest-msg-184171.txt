I would agree, except when people look at you as a twink. My rogue was given
some pretty decent stuff. Nothing great, but nice for the level. I got a
random tell from a character asking to meet him at the orc lift in Kelethin.
Said he had stuff for me. Well, when I got there, he told me I was twinked
and to forget it. I tried to explain to him that someone donated stuff to
me, just as he was about to do. But he didn't listen.

A twink might mean one thing, but in game, based on looks alone., you can't
tell a twink from someone was handed donations.
