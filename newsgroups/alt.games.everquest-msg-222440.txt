They aren't my issues, I'm an atheist wannabe, remember?  Just
commenting on the source for the "whole of the law" quote.

You may well be right, I'm pretty sure I first saw it in an
unabridged The Golden Bough, but its been ages since I read it,
and I'm largely relying on the position of modern Wiccans that
say this is an old beyond the hills edict passed down by oral
tradition... hard to site a source for oral tradition though.

None of it's particularly interesting to me, though, if you want
to get to the heart of my rather limited faith you'd do better to
argue quotes from the Tao of Pooh.
