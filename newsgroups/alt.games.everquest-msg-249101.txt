Ironic that the greatest distraction removed by LDON was the other 
players.

Come play a massively multiplayer game in a world with 2000 people
online! And... isolate yourself with 5 of them in a time pressure
environment that renders frivolity, banter, conversation and
any meaningful interaction as likely as meeting the Pope.

Brilliant idea. Really.
