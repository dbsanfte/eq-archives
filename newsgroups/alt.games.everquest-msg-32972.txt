Lots of screaming abou this on Graffe's, too.  Personally, I think
they just changed the item tag so people won't be confused as to why
they can't put it in thier offhand.  I see no mention that the staff
is no longer usable from inventory.

To be honest, at this point the SoTF is so useful when solo'ing, I'd
equip it instead of the SotW.  Remember, it's not just the debuff
abilty (which is so tiny as to not be noticable), it lets you judge
the range of your nukes, so you know when to stop running and start
blasting.

The only real killer nerf they could give this thing would be to give
it a casting time.  Then, yeah, I'd be pretty pissed.

Pretty damned big.  But then again, I can easily hit 112 intel with my
human wizzy, so it's honestly not much of a problem now.
