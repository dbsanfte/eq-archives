March 1st 2003

    Just curious I live out in the country. Well actually in the
Middle of nowhere I mean in the Sticks.  I have a Pentium 4 computer
at 1.6 ghrz 256 megs of ram and a 16bit ati rage 128 ultra pro Video
card. and an 80 gig Drive.  I'm zoning pretty slow Wish I had
High-speed but it's not avalible in my area. Just wondering can anyone
recommend a good Data Rate for Everquest for a 28.8 connection.  The
Modem itself is 56k but being out in the Sticks its like 1960's
phoneline.  The 28.8 Connection though is pretty stable and actually
pretty Decent for on-line Rping Games.  And I used to play Mech
warrior 3 with minimal Lag.  If the game is the only online Program
you use at one time It's works rather well.  But I just need to figure
out  What would be a good Data rate.

Currently I believe the Default is 6.0 I think.  Myself I changed it
to 4.2 Because someone said it would improve zoning Time. Not really
the case but anyhelp would be appreciated.
