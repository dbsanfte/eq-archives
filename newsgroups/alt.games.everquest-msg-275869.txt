  Alas, the high hopes of going to the top with Acropolis have crumbled.
People left the guild in droves over the last two weeks. One weekend of
no raiding might have been accepted, but when a second weekend passed
and the raid leaders just couldn't be bothered to play on Saturday and key
classes didn't show up on Sunday, people decided they would not get uber
in Acrop, and voted with their feet.

  It's beginning to look like I have a black thumb for guilds; if I join 
one, it
is surely doomed. Or perhaps just bad judgement in where I choose to go.

  Whither Adastraea? Nay, she shall not wither, she is no shrinking violet;
but who will have a wizard who plays at the most horrible hours? I may
live on Eastern time, but I play after midnight; what time zone would that
effectively be? Pacific? Hawaii? Samoa? TP's Austrailian guild, Wreckers,
starts raiding at 4am my time, far too late/early for me.

  Malus Imperium still requires raiding during my work hours. Through The
Never might, also. Eternal Sovereign is open to former Acrop members,
but will they work around my hours? Several of my better CotF friends
ended up in Crusaders Valorous, but they do not seem to be accepting
applicants just now. A necessary move, to keep from endlessly backflagging;
at some point, you have to draw the line and say we will go forward with 
what
we have and not spin our wheels while we bring up planar newbies.

  Ahhh, hell, SOE just changed the question, anyways. The mergers have 
begun!
Tholuxe Paells, being a historically low population server, is certain to 
vanish.
The question for me is not What guild do I join? but What server do I move 
to?

  Just have to wait and see who we're merging with, and when. And where my
friends go. And which set of friends to follow.

  In the meantime, I think I will get more enjoyment out of the game with my
lower level alts. Neuv has gotten planar; Tosev can be as well, in a few 
days. I've
been getting regular groups in OT for Celune, at last, but she will really 
come into
her own at level 44, selling Temp when no one else is. And Grukyn has shown 
me
the ownage of beaslords: with NO Temp, just his own self-buffs, and far 
outdated
twink gear, he ahndled himself quite well in DSP at level 31. I know from 
way back
he should be soloing in OT at level 36. He will let me kill stuff even Adas 
can't handle,
things that summon.

  BUT FIRST...vacation time! Albequirky, Frisco, and that particular circle 
of Hell
from which SOE screws everything up. I may just give them an earful...
