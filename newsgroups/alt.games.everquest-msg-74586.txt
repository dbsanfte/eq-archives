Uh...  a level 60 in a group of all level 50's will be getting approximately
19.4 percent of the experience per kill.   Compared to the level 50's, which
will each be getting 16.1 percent.    If everyone in the group was level 50,
each person would get 16.7 percent of the experience.

If six tenths of a percent of the experience is too much to pay for the vastly
increased kill rate, I just don't know what to tell you. ; )  And it making
you spend 2 to 3 times the effort... heh.   Thats pretty funny. ; )
Experience hunting is much, much easier now that the level 60's are back in
the picture, unless it causes overcrowding at the hunting areas.   And don't
even begin to claim it does, since there are plenty of places to go now, with
Luclin adding extra single group hunting locations.
