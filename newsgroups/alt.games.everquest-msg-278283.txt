It could work.  The necro epics 1.5 and 2.0 have an effect called 
"servant of blood," which is basically like this only more necroish 
(like it steals health from mobs and gives it to your group instead of 
casting heals).  At least, that's how I understand it works. 
Unfortunatly, my necro doesn't have the epics yet, so I can't talk from 
personal experience, but it pretty much sounds like the same thing.
