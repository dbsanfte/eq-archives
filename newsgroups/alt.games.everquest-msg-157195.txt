Ummm.  My main is a 54 Paladin, I do have a 25 Druid on FV that I play
sometimes, but his xp goes up slow because it's so hard to just sit
there until the mob gets around to falling over, I usually jump in and
get soundly thrashed until the root wears off and it turns to flee.
Of course, they don't actually flee, they just stand there, victims of
possibly the single most unrealistic bit of the AI: "snare dumb"  (Heh,
can you imagine the outcry if that was ever nerfed?  It would be like
nothing that has gone before.)  Hmmm, rambling again, um, the point is
that my game persona is Paladin, not Druid, even if I do play at being
a Druid from time to time.


Kaev <--- made it this far without commenting on what has got to be
SanjiansSpellingSpecialOfTheDay(tm), but, um, wow, that's definitely
one of your best.
