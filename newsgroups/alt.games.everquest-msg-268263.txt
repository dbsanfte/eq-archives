This is a tiny instanced zone in Antonica. However, I swear I am the
only person on Blackburrow who even seems to know it exists.

If you all find "a strange gem" out there, and when you examine it get
a very vague quest, that's what its for. Use it. That tiny little zone
packs several named, instant respawn, with all mobs around the 17-20
range (group). You do need three people at least to go in, but only
one needs the gem. Best experience in the game at the 20 range that
I've seen so far.

There isn't a hint of this on Allas. They don't even list the zone.
