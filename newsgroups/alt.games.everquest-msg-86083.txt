EXACTLY. And the problem is when a person finds that Marilyn is taken
so they pick Marilyyn as their login but still use manson as the
password. What you then have is the first person who picked
Marilyn/manson being one typo away from accessing the other's account,
and the opposite. There is actually some program under linux which
uses a dictionary I think or something to tell you when a password is
not good.
