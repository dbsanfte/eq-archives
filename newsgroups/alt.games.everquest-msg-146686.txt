No, no, no, you've got it all wrong.  Clearly, under TheVision(tm), the
purpose of AoE spells is to pull multiple mobs simultaneously upon the
head of the poor, unsuspecting, caster.  And, of course, an important
secondary function of the PBAoE spells is to agro that nearby newbie
guard when a novice caster tries out his shiny new spell to find out
what it does.
