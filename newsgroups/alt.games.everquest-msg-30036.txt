I don't want to harp on it too much, but people that can get away with the
shorter range<50> should really try out the magician summoned arrows, 3
damage, range 50, magic, and you get 20 per cast. I have a magician,
ranger/fletcher/archer, pali/archer. I will run the ranger across Norath to
the magician rather then fletch enough arrows for an evening.
