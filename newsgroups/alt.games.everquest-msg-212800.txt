Some suggestions for what you describe your guild as:

Grimling war all of them up to the 5th.  The last war as some excellent
rewards for level 50's.  This is a time commitment probably around 4hours.
But its something that is usually open.

Fungus Grove Caller event.  You can run all 3 at the same time and if you
have enough healers these are pretty easy.  Mobs are slowable and hit for
80-100ish.

Trakanon.  He's up a lot on our server and he's a good challenge for a guild
with smaller numbers or lower levels.  Resists are a factor here but this is
a dungeon crawl with a nice mob at the end to try.

(Veksar dragon would eat you by the way, besides being a pain to get the
shards to spawn him, his ae is horrible and his hit box is so small that if
he gets ping pong'd at all you'll probably wipe.  However when you start
getting some 60+ groups he would be a good one to consider.)

Talendor is another dragon that isn't too tough.  Fire resists are key but 4
groups could take him.  He's in skyfire.

You might try other things like freeing the slaves in Droga/Nurga.  Depening
on how many you have show up, nurga is easier.

Velketor is easier then Vindi IMO and if you can get the strategy down 4
groups could take him as well, he's all about pushing around :p

As for an SK tanking, i think the rule of thumb is whoever has the most
hp,ac should tank because its more mana efficient to heal them.  Usually
this means that if a warrior is tanking he will need to "build" aggro, if
its your sk then you can engage almost immediately.

Oh if you are looking for a hate proc sword, the "remains" in veksar drops
one that is very nice and that's a single group encounter.  Sword is "no
drop".
