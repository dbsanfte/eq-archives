I'm guessing that since the recent DoT changes they WOULD stack however
you'd probably find that doing almost anything else is more efficient use
of your mana.  As you get the higher level disease DoTs you'll find it
takes several roots to see the full effect in any case (I can melee mobs to
death faster with my Shaman than Scourge kills them for example).
