You can kill light blues faster in one circumstance...and that is when you
get a new pet spell if a magician or necro. I remember getting my last air
pet spell and going on a wholesale slaughter in Gunthak and Dulak.
Everything was light blue and blue, I averaged over 1500 plat every three
hours, and the exp was rolling in for me. I had AA set to 10% and still made
half a level normal exp a day in a six to seven hour play session soloing.
Average kill time per mob of any con was 25 seconds. As I edged over level
62 I moved on to Nadox and repeated he style.
   Since a pet is four levels below you when you get it, the pet is then
about an even match for a light blue con mob to you. LoY mobs hit very hard
and have a bit more hitpoints than old world mobs but with the new pet heal
spells this makes the odds in your favor. As long as you solo pull each
light blue mob, the new pet will tear them up fast with only an occasional
heal from you. I rarely nuked unless a heal didn't get off in time or
fizzled to much.
