Your system is pretty common now btw, so with that in mind...I think what
you need to do, if you're really intent on solving this, is to format and
reinstall Win2k again and maybe take it one step at a time

 - install Win2k and necessary video drivers - leaving stock win2k directx
in place
    - does EQ run?
        - Install newest sound driver
            - does EQ run?
.....
that kind of deal until you find out which one of these is doing it.  I
didn't get that kind of driver by driver description of your situation, more
like you just kind of installed everything after a clean install, fired up
EQ and blam.  This would be my next course of action if I were you.
