Hi everyone:

After taking a much needed break from my main (65 Wizard) and playing an
Enchanter for twenty levels I decided to try my hand at a Necromancer - Wow,
what fun it is too! My character is currently level 11.

I do have a couple of questions though, and would be delighted if someone
can give me a few pointers.

1)    Rather obviously I can give my pet a weapon, even though he seems to
fight exceedingly well without one. At what level will my pet get a
significant advantage from me giving him a weapon?

2)    My Necro is a Gnome, so he's not KoS everywhere that he goes. I know
that Necro's have faction issues in many places, but what (if any) faction
must I *not* ruin? Yes I know that faction can be fixed (in most cases) but
I'd rather not have to spend countless days fixing faction when I can avoid
damaging it in the first place. For my Wizard I had to preserve my
TrueSpirit faction for my epic.

3)    Finally, I'm having a hard job making my pet stop attacking the mob.
Typically, I'll pull a blue with 'Poison Bolt' and then cast 'Clinging
Darkness' - I then let my pet fight the mob and only step in if the pet is
taking a beating. Thing is, when I decide to pull out and let the pet fight
alone again I can rarely fire off 'Lifespike' before the pet kills the mob.
Is there a way (other than to 'pet get lost' to make the pet *stop*
attacking the mob completely? Pet back off doesn't work for me.

Many thanks in advance,

Stevie.
