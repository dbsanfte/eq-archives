I did.  How do you use the lures you make?  The lure itself has no
note of a plus to fishing skill and it won't go into the range slot. 
Also, am I going to loose my lures when i catch a fish, like with
bait?  That would be annoying.  Also, lures sell to merchants for only
4cp.

I find catching 8 different types of fish in FV annoying.  They take
up too many slots!  Gotta love it.
