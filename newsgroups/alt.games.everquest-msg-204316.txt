I agree.  Some people have just broken the NDA and howled about SWG on
various EQ related sites.  Many of the complaints have said that SWG lacks
true challenge.  There's no chance that I'll play SWG, but I'm curious as to
whether it will live up to the hype or down to the rants.  Tyas_MT, fire
away whenever you're ready.
