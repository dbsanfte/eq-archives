That's why I said to ask the raid leader. If you don't know what
you're doing it probably is a bad thing to do.

That's pretty much what we do. We have the clerics run to the SS and
bind before trying to camp out. If they die, there's probably someone
feigned, telling them when to log back in, if they got the bind off.
I've been able to kite stuff west of the SS (including Dracholiche)
long enough to get clerics camped.
