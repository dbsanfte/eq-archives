2 responses:

1) You *already do that for droppables*. Adding usefulness to no drops 
would just allow you more places to go that would still be relevant 
instead of relegating you to the few places that have worthwhile 
droppables.

2) I really doubt your going to get a raid guild excited about going 
back to an old zone to farm tribute items as a raid. Its just not going 
to happen. Besides plenty 'gratz rot' drops wherever you already are too 
eliminating the need. Why go to Time "again" in the hopes of a tribute 
item, when you can go to NewZone X in the hopes of an upgrade, and if 
not, at least its a tribute item.
