I wanted to do some PLing on my daughters 30 DE warrior and my sons 30 DE
SK.  I was thinking of Mistmoor because then I could keep my eye on Black
Dire while I'm at it.  The problem is I'm not sure if killing the DE's in
this zone will ruin their faction in Neriak.  I tried finding out on
Allakazam, but I couldn't find a definite answer.

Anyone know for sure?
