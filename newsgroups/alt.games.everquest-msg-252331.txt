I have no idea what this means. I do commercial software development.
I don't deliver code. I don't install code. I don't train users. I
don't write manuals. I don't do quality assurance. I write code.

>five sites across the continent

Irrelevant. My job is identical whether the company I work for sells
my application to 1 customer or 1000 customers. 

>five different legacy systems

Five different operating systems is five different projects, not one
project.

>with three different managements and four
>primary vendor relationships. 

This is a corporate political problem not a development problem.

I have no idea what a "core module" is... what programming language
are you talking about? Do you mean 500 different programs? That would
be 500 different projects, with 500 different development teams, not
one. Or do you mean 500 functions within a single program? I could do
that myself in a year's time, easily.

We're obviously talking about apples and oranges here. No software
developer at a company I've worked for has ever been asked to read a
"business analysis" :D

Hmmm.... for the last 8 years I have done the Windows client side
applications for industrial grade client/server applications. Some of
the biggest companies in the world use apps that I've written. Dunno
what's larger scale than that. 

I think maybe the problem is your friend works for a company that does
custom software on a customer by customer basis. I used to do that,
working for small companies. It's a royal pain in the ass, and I'm
glad I don't do it anymore. The large software companies make
pre-packaged apllications, and sell custom "suites" made up of
whatever of the pre-packaged products they have available that they've
been able to sell to the company. Usually under an Enterprise
Management shell of some sort. Each of the point products in the suite
would consist of at least two teams, one for client side and one for
server side, and therefore two different projects. Possible more, if
the work load could be broken down into more than two cohesive
individual sections.

I don't know either. I experimented with modding Vice City, though,
and as I recall it has a couple hundred detailed textures - cars,
people, etc - and a couple hundred more simple textures.

Which is certainly within the capabilities of a few graphic artists to
do in a year's time.

I said PC. I didn't say console. The console industry has ALWAYS been
huge. It's also always been a completely different market than the PC
game industry. 42 million people bought super mario brothers games for
the Nintendo in the 1980s. I wasn't one of them. I was one of the
100,000 or so fans of PC games. The fundamentals of the PC game
industry and the console game industry have not changed in the last 20
years. Some people have just thought that they have. And they've paid
for that mistake dearly.
