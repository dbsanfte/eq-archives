Absolutely and positively wrong.

This is fine for Vox.

This is not fine for Burrower little vomit horde and
for when somebody trains your AoW kill "just to
watch."

Sometimes having a few "real" tanks along to "tank
mez" the adds is just as  essential as the enchanters
to actually mez or the cleric/druid/shaman/necro
to "ghetto" mez (root).

Too many tanks can ruin your damage curve,
but is that "really" as important as the ability to
handle adds in a tough CR zone?
