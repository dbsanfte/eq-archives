I had those exact same symptoms.  It was even worse in the morning, I could
barely pick anything up (had a hell of a time turning on the shower).
What's worse is I work with computers all day, then come home and play EQ
all night.  I was constantly rotating my hand trying to shake off the pain.
I feared the worst, thinking it had to be carpel tunnel and I would need
surgery (I've been using computers for 8+ hours a day for 10 years or so).
I went to the doctor (ok so my wife made me as she was tired of me begging
for symphony).  I was relived to find out the muscles were just swollen in
my hand (called a repative motion injury) and muscle relaxers and
anti-inflammatory drugs cured it with a week or two.  The doctor also
suggested I wear a wrist brace but oddly only at night and not when using
the pc.  Bottom line, go to the doctor soon, it will more then likely be
cured with medication in a few weeks.
If you don't want to go to the doctor then I'd advise you get a wrist brace
and sleep with it at night for a week or two.  I'd also advise you take some
over the counter anti-inflammatory drug like naproxen (Aleve).
Hope this helps in some way.
