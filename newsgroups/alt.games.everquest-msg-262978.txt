I was grouped with a person the other day and they were discussing PvP 
servers.  We were on The Nameless and they said it was their alt, the main 
was on the PvP server.  It sounded kinda fun but I have some questions about 
the "hows and whats" that people do there.

Is there a site where I can read about what is accecptable or not?
Do races fight amoungst themselves or is it a "good vs evil" type thing?
Should I pick a class that is more solo or group dependent?
Is there a better server to pick for a first-time PvP player?
Any and everything else I left out.....LOL

Thanks for the info and the help.
