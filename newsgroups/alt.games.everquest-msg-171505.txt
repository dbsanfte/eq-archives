That sounds familiar!  I thought I would get about 8-10 people together to
get myself the drums and was lucky enough to find that almost 30 people were
on their way to help when I logged on for the party.  Did it drop?  No.  Did
some of us get smoked?  Yes. Hell, some didn't even make it past the Drow
camp on the way to MM.  I was disappointed when the bitch didn't drop the
drums and didn't spawn again after over 3 hours.
The moral of this story?  Go to the Bazaar, lol!  After all that trouble I
bought it there for less than 100pp.
The same goes for the tambourine quest, or at least a part of it.  I went to
get the coin from the dw gobbies in LOIO 3 nights in a row with a small
group of 4.  We got hammered by the nasty gobbies a few times.  I got my
coin though on the fourth day! I bought it from the vendor in the middle of
the lake for 1sp, 1cp.  BAH!
