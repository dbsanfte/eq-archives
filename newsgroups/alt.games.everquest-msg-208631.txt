From the shadows, the mysterious "Stonemage" <forgot@email.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>I was hunting in The Grey with my Enchanter, and using Water Elemental as

>I camped out, thinking that when I logged back in - I'd have enough time
>before the breath bar ran out to recast the illusion.
>
>Well I was in for a nice surprise - upon logging in I was choking and
>already down to half health.
>
>Died very soon after - when you lose 170hp per tick, and you've not got much

>I guess the moral of this is - get yourself an Enduring Breath Item and
>never ever rely on a spell or illusion.
