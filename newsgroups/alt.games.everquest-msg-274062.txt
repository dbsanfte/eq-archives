Don't bother.  The type of person you argue with is the type of person
who is never going to see it wrong to use any kind of words.  I saw it
*all* during the beta. Constant whining that their names were found
innappropriate, or about swearing.  Then they'd go into this whole rant
about what is appropriate and what is not, and who is to say.

They don't get it. It's Blizzard's server, and they can do what they want,
and all the crying in the world doesn't change it.  I've predicted that
WoW will fail, but I have no sympathy for people who break the naming
or general chat rules and then whine about it when caught.
