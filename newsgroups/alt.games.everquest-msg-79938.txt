Safefall skill will increase if you have trained a point into it by falling.
You have to find the distance of fall that won't hurt but will still give
skillup.  Be patient, it will raise.  Skill is capped at 94 for rogues I
belive.

You can get skill increases by fighting Full Blue mobs or higher

PP will only work with certain mobs. I have read "those mobs that could have
pockets" but I PP goos and have to wonder about that.

Parry is a skill that will block an attack from the front. Put 1 point in
and it will raise on its own.  Ripose is similar but offers a counterattack.

If

both.  You will get 3 attacks per cycle with Mainhand, Offhand and Backstab.

at higher levels you get more...

Double attack = 2 + dual wield = 4 + backstab = 5 + ripose =6
