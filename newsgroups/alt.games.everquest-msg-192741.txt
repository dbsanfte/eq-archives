Horus vandalized the alt.games.everquest bathroom wall with:

I also would recommend holding off on getting it.  Learn to run from point
A to point B.  Those are some of my best memories or EQ, please being a
great learing experience.  You learn about aggro radius, how to get away
from things that are trying to kill you *smirk* and how effective your
spells/abilities are.  You will also meet some great people along the way,
well at least I did.  Enjoy EQ!
