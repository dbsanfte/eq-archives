Ah, sorry, I did mean Radiant cure.  However, I am confused why it
isn't MGBable.  According to Lucy, Radiant Cure is a Group v2 AA, and
so is Spirit of the Wood.  (RC has an AE range of 100, SoTW has an AE
range of 200.)  So from a game mechanic point of view, I would assume
that they should react to an MGB the same way.  I could have sworn that
Druids had an MGBable way to remove detrimental effects, but I am happy
to be corrected.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
