No.  They are simply not tradeable at all and can't be placed in
shared slots.

10 total.

Not sure if 4 or 6 slot version exists, all the bag I've had that
turned into dischanted bag are always 10 slots.

You can fill all 24 bank slots with the bags but the shared slot still
requires regular dropable bags.  I leave toolboxes for those.

True.  And the barter bag is actually a bit lighter than the
dischanted bags.
