}Chanters doing chain rune might see some actual cash savings worth
}sneeezing at.  Probably not though.

So far, I've chain-runed twice.  And both times, I just used the jasper 
rune (Rune III) and it ws plenty.  I've cast Rune V maybe 8 times, ever.  
It's -possible- I just haven't gotten to the level of encounter where it's 
useful, or I'm not seeing the times when it would make a tremendous 
difference...  But then, nobody ever makes a big deal about reimbursing 
the enchanter for peridots, So I'm usually not even carrying more than 3 
or 4.
