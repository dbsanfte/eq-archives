I wasn't able to play last night to test this out. (I'm moving and the
cable company isn't coming to set up my cable modem until Sat.)  So I
was wondering, if you just sit to meditate, does your meditate skill go
up or do you have to actually look at the book at the start of each
level to max it out?
