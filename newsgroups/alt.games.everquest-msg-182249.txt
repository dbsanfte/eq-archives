I've accidently killed someone's pull.  I never saw the puller, just an orc
blatently tooling along right in front of me.  Now there are just things you
can't let them get away with, so I nailed him.  The puller got rather upset.
I apologized, but he didn't seem real satisfied, so I just moved on.

What it comes down to is that stealing has to be intentional.  If you are
trying to help, or if you get one like I said above, by accident, I don't
think many GMs are going to give you a hard time.  I've watched some players
near death, while the two or three orcs seem at full strength.  Then, all of
a sudden, the player will simply stop losing life, and start winning the
battle.  And there I was, about to jump in and help.  So, you have to be
careful, but don't feel too bad if your intentions were good.  Sometimes you
just have to walk away.

I just try to remember it's a game, and not worth getting in a pissing
contest about.  I realize some people invest way too much of their life in
Everquest, and for them, every little thing may be a big deal.  Play nice
with those that play nice and /ignore those that get too annoying.  So far,
I have not had to resort to the latter.

Cheers,
Eric
