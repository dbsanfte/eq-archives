I do, but in your first post you don't say "Precia-sama" you say
straight out that Megumi means Goddess, "I had better not name myself
Megumi, since any first-year japanese student could tell you that it
means "Goddess", not that it means more like Charity.
Also I'm "not" a first year student in Japanese so why should I know
this.
You do know what Gottin means right, or Diosa, Deesse, well any first
year student in German, Spanish or French would know.
