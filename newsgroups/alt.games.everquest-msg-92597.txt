Is it true that the skill raise check is independent of the level
of the spell cast? I have often wondered about that; is there any
research out there to this end?

My shaman has a conjuration skill in the 160s (at level 39).
I have been chain casting Summon Food / Drink to try to raise it.
The points are VERY few and far between. However, I got two points
last night from casting higher level poison/disease DoTs very
occasionally during an hour of fighting. My perception is that
higher level spells give a higher change of skill raises, but
it might be just that, perception.
