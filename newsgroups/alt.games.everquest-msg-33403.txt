Play nice is Verant's policy.  Sharing camps is part of the play nice
policy.  The accepted norm in EQ (not accepted by everyone, but most) is
that camping is fine, and camps are honored in general and within reason.
For example, saying that you are camping NRo will not be honored.  Camping
Derv 1 in NRo will very likely be honored.

How many other places in the game can you go to play?  In the end it is up
to you whether to honor camps, or not.  You can force the issue, but you
will most likely get a bad reputation, and have difficulty finding groups,
and of course, difficulty camping anything.

In the end, you have to make the decision as to whether that is worth it to
you or not.  In reality, there are so many places you can go to hunt, in
groups, or solo, that having particular places camped will not stop you from
gaining xp and loot, just particular items.
