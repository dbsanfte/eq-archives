actually if he said he wanted to pay cash for the items it would be against
the EULA, but since hes payin you 10p for the items its perfectly legal, the
cash is for your personal time killing/camping for the said items, i
sell/buy all the time for items i need/want

I love flames, just adds names to my ignore filter, HA!

its great when you can buy a lvl 60 cleric for only 300 dollars and save you
the all the time doing it yourself, heheh
