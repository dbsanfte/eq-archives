I made a level one wood elf ranger, 100 stamina ( thats all points to 
sta).  34 HP.  Then I made a level one wood elf ranger, 95 stamina 
(again, all points to sta).  31 hp.  I think you are overstating the HP 
margin between the classes a bit.

Ranger track allows sorting by a number of things, including proximity. 
If there's a level 18 SK wandering around in the zone with a level 6 
ranger, knowing whether that SK is near or far should be a big priority. 
  And knowing which direction he's in should also help a lot.

And if you're a level 8 ranger, whats so bad about knowing where that 
level 6 SK is... track to him, watch from afar (hidden) till he's used 
his nasty HT, then jump him.  Even if its "only" useful for hunters, 
isn't every PC on Discord meant to be a hunter?

None at all!

Trouble (my first and thus far only character to hit level 6 on discord)
