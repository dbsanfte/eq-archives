I've long held that monks are outrageously overpowered,
with (non Defensive mode) warrior or better damage
mitigation and (correctly positioned) Rogue level damage
output

As such, I welcome the idea of nerfing back some of
their damage mitigation, although frankly I disagree with
attacking them directly, and think Warriors should have
been beefed up, with something done to bring in a leather/
chain/plate progression in mitigation, instead of striking
only at monks.

WEll, that aside, I've seen a significant problem with
the idea of nerfing monk mitigation mentioned in other
threads.  This is that monks take a mighty beating
while pulling.  Unslowed mobs, often multiple ones,
often laying in HT and spells on our poor pulling
monk, beat him to a pulp as it stands.  Pull down
his mitigation to logical levels and he's going to look
like that rare breed, the pulling necromancer.  Low
HP totals combined with low mitigation = CR.

But I agree with Verant, I don't want to see the
monk continue to be a viable Sponge while remaining
a superlative damage dealer.

What I see as a possible solution, then, would be
a new discipline or skill (NOT a class AA skill,
which would mean useful only at high end of game)
that increases mitigation, but only while moving
away.  This would prevent the ability from becoming
the next Defensive; monks wouldn't be able to hold
aggro while facing away from the mob, and would
only be capable of taking that beating while doing
so.

But hopefully this would rescue monks from the
ash heap of former pullers, as they'd now be
able to reasonably withstand the damage they
take while bringing that mob back in.

Note I say reasonably.  In fact, I have a suggestion
as to how much this would help: it would restore
the mitigation for the monk to exactly where it is
now.  In other words, pulling wouldn't get easier,
it would be exactly as difficult as it is now... but
it wouldn't get ludicrously -more- difficult, as we
are guessing it is about to.

I do forsee some potential "abuse" of this, with monks
running around trailing mobs while casters nuke
and pets follow, the classic "hate" kite... but since
the monks won't be doing any damage, I don't see
it as really viable, they will have to keep swinging around
to re-acquire aggro, and at best won't have any more
damage mitigation than they do now anyway... so whats
the harm?

A more powerful version of this would be something
that reminds me of the original Star Wars videogame,
where you'd turn off attacks and just fly the ship
thru the tunnel, oddly tending to take less damage
and if successful, getting far more points; a "use
the force, Luke" option, for monks to stop attacks
and get twice their normal defenses; dodge, parry,
block, whatever.  Again, if someone else is on the
mob you don't get a lot of use out of this since
the monk will rapidly lose aggro, and they already
have FD if thats the point, but ramping mitigation
up sharply during the pull would help a lot, and here
you could actually see some small group tactics
develop with a monk MA, using root and prox
aggro to force the mob to beat on the largely
untouchable monk.  This wouldn't bother my "monks
do all that damage and sponge that well too?" feelings,
since he'd have to stop doing the damage and trade it
in on the sponging capability.
