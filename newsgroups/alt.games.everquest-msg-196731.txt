In the absence of a chanter, that's all that is expected. It's really not 
too tough. You keep three mezzed until the tank can get to one of them, 
then keep two mezzed while mixing in a buff song until the tank can get 
to one of those two, then leave your mez up on the last one while you 
help beat down the other.

A mid-level bard can handle crowd control well enough as necessary, 
provided the pulls are kept reasonable.
