I can imagine that.  Sounds like that old Coke commercial heh.  I'd like
to teach the world to sing....  Some folks have issues with that I
guess, not me.  I once spent an evening chatting in a virtual world
simulator with a gentleman from somewhere in either the middle east or
north africa.  He insisted on not telling me where he was from because
he said his country was my country's enemy.  We, on the other hand had a
great chat, relating on many levels despite the fact that he was about
as foriegn to me as I could imagine and spoke very little english.  In
Tanarus I once spent an evening with an entirely japanese team, no clue
what their plans were till their tanks  moved since all strategy was in
japanese.  Years later I still laugh at what they must have been
thinking about the silly american following them around with no clue
what we were doing till we did it.  Don't fear what you don't
understand, celebrate the difference, or as we say on Karana... viva la
difference!!
