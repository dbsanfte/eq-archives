I never asked for -that-.

Actually, people like me would go there to hunt (recall that I am not 
using the bazaar). But yes there would be no shortage of people turning 
their noses up at it to shop in the bazaar unless the xp was at least on 
par with other good places to hunt and/or the items that did drop could 
be turned in and upgraded as you level up to eventually result in 'uber 
stuff', or some other scheme was used to make the 'mid-level' stuff have 
additional value. (e.g. high tribute, etc etc )

Yes of course. I agree. That would be a bad idea.

OK. The Rabid Chodakai is listed as 63-65th level. Assuming that is 
accurate I don't think I need to 'try and find out what happens'... I 
can summarize in 3 words: "Loading. Please Wait."

To an extent you are right. But your pointing at the problem and 
refusing to see it. Its not a that midlevel players don't need new 
content its that midlevel players cannot escape the bazaar if they want 
to maximize their output. That is a serious flaw in the game. As the 
developers of Vangaurd put it "The path of least resistance should also 
be the most fun." In EQ the path of least resistance is farming pp and 
shopping in the bazaar at the low to mid level game... and the most fun 
is exploring new zones and looting good usable stuff. Clearly shopping 
in the bazaar is not.
