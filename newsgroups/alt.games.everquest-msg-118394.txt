Got the correct term right from the start, and confident about using it
in the right context too.

You've obviously been doing your research on this subject. I assume
then, as an adult, you agree that what she was attempting to do was in
violation of that license. Would you further agree that Sony would be
well within their rights outlined in that license to cancel the account
of anyone found selling or transferring accounts should they wish to?

Pretty big assumption for someone who has purportedly never been here
before, and knows nothing about Usenet.

Why? Usenet is anonymous. If the MD of VI wanted to come on here under
an assumed name and flame the hell out of people, there's no
restrictions on it. If you them company employees don't moth off bout
their customers, you've got another thing coming. Here they can do it in
anonymity to their faces, so I don't doubt for one minute some of the
people who post here are VI staff incognito.

Account sales do directly effect us.

1: Grouping with a L40 character, you assume they have 40 levels of
experience. Finding out they bought the character the day before and
don't know what spells are, adversely effects your game.

2: People have, in the past, specifically farmed items for the intent to
sell. This means that people playing the game cannot get those items
because they are camped by the farmers. This is a rare event, but would
happen much more if VI hadn't stamped down on out-of-game sales.

3: Resources Sony allocate on stopping sales are diverted from the
actual game.

Trying to get around the EULA by re-wording things doesn't fly. You were
offering the accept items in exchange for cash. Period. If they spent
the 'time' to aquire those items, but hey didn't drop, would you still
have paid for the 'time'? O course not, because you were paying for
ITEMS.

I put it to you that there is no 'little girl', just the oft used excuse
of 'It weren't me, it were my brudder!'. 

13 year old girls don't generally write stuff like:
