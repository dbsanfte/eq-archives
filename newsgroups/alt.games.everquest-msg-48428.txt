It will get easier.  Ask questions of the people who are playing and seem to
know what they are doing.  If they act like assholes, well, they are and
aren't worth your time.  Eventually, you will find someone who isn't.
Obviously, you don't want to pester someone, but good people don't mind
answering a well phrased / written question.  I suggest using the /ooc
channel for questions you have, others will suggest the /shout channel.

For instance, type:

/ooc Is there a kind soul who doesn't mind showing someone new where the
bank is?  I would really appreicate it.  I'm standing by this guard named
"John Boy".

A nice person will most likely help you.

After you die, go "loot" your corpse like you loot the corpses of the
monsters ( right-click on them or target them and type /loot ).  That will
get your hard-earned cash back.  Then, go put some of that cash in the local
bank.  That bank is "magical" and can be accessed by any bank in the world
( as far as I know ).

Your corpse only has a limited time to lie there before it disappears.  This
time varies with your level, but I -think- that at level 6 the time it lasts
gets appreciably higher.  There was a recent thread ( I have it ignored, so
can't give you the title ) about the life-span of a corpse.  It probably has
some good information in it.

Good luck.  You might want to check out:  http://groups.google.com  to
search for answers to any questions you have.  You can specify a specific
newsgroup to search.
