Uh, James? Did you read that Other Thread at all? You know, the one
where he constantly presented his opinions as facts and ridiculed
those whose opinions he didn't like? He's either insanely stupid,
or a troll. I dunno which yet. Strangely enough, I seem to remember
reading interesting and informative posts from him, wonder what
happened?
