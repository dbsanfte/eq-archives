Yup, the Silk tunic just gave me the DE bikini look.

RyGorr chain look as HEF, fools stein and a CHA dolly off a Feerrott shaman.
That plus clicking my tboots now and then complete my Druid look.  If I want
to really throw someone for a loop, I could click my Star of Eyes (Identify)
for the lightshow.

Hmmm, I should get the timing of Gate down and macro in a combo of 1) start
macro 2) click item 3) macro does casting emote 4) at right time, I /hide.
