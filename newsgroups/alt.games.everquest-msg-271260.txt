I think too much temp in his 20s might prevent him from ever getting to 
60. When he hits that wall where temp no longer makes a difference, 
he'll have to come to grips with the fact that EQ is nothing like what 
he's been playing so far.

'As a cleric'? Right!... because every group has one all the time. What 
about those groups where youve got a paladin, necro, or beastlord for 
healing? Of course, 'as a cleric' you've never seen one of those... but 
looking at healing from the perspective of a cleric, you don't think its 
just a little skewed?

Well, fully half the players I encounter with a V or KEI dispelled want 
to run back to PoK for a refresh.

I've played characters to 50+ with a Bard and Paladin for healing. I've 
done LDoNs with two necros doing the healing.

There are over a dozen classes, and 5 slots other than him in a group. 
The only people who never go without a cleric in their group are clerics 
and the gimps who won't leave pok without them. 'As a cleric' you'd fall 
into the first category.

I have many alts in the 40s and 50s. *You* might not have to worry about 
it, but I group with people like him all the time.
