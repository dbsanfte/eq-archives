On the other hand, I know two people who got ripped off who
to this day swear that NO ONE knew their password.

Also, one has to wonder about the breakdown of people who
actually /petition their losses to Verant (and keep in mind
that Verant is apparently getting such a heavy load of these
that it's overloading their CS department, so there must
be a lot of them).

Think about it -- people who give passwords to friends and
then get ripped off *know* who ripped them off.  Why
petition to Verant, why not go visit the friend with a
baseball bat to get the item back?  Or return the favor,
since account-sharing is usually a two-way street?

While a few would try Verant anyway to seek redress
that way, I wouldn't be surprised if the ones that
petition to Verant for help are predominantly those
who simply have no clue what happened to their account,
because no one had their password (that they knew of).
Thus they petition because they have nowhere else
to turn to.
