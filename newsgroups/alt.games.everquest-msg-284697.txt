Regardless of what the EULA says, I submit there's better places for working 
one's rocks.

Perhaps here?  Are YOU this guy?  Hey, you can holler, "EULA!," during those 
intimate moments that we all know belong HERE, or with "Letters to 
Penthouse," instead on some silly game like this. But, what's "offended?" 
Hell, there's a slippery slope here.

What's too far?

Nothing ... if getting my kids propositioned for cybersex in Gunthak by some 
perv isn't pushing it too far, then there isn't anything.  Nothing.

Go ahead, I wanna hear the pro-cybersex contingent., you sanctimonious 
prick.

Tell ya what ... read the EULA.  Again.

If enough people get offered pp for cybersex, and their kids too ... it 
takes care of itself.
