I really wish Verant would make it so you can exchange lower coins for
higher coins with merchants.  That and putting at least one merchant in each
zone ... and not at the bottom of the zone's dungeon.

Currently, I'm at the fort in Frontier Mountain and it sucks having to run
all the way back each night before logging to sell stuff to merchants in
Fironia Vie then deposit the day's receipts into the FV's bank.  It sucked
MAJORLY tonight when the spiders outside of FV killed me twice tonight.  I
wasn't hunting them.  I was just trying to run to sell and bank in FV before
logging for the night.  Because of those two deaths, I lost my new 31st
level and all the XP I gained that night.  Both times my Halfling cleric had
SoW on.  Was this fun?  Did it make my enjoyment of the game that much more?
Guess my answer.

And how much would all this require?  I don't think much.  It could all be
done in one of the weekly patches.  All it takes is making sure each zone
has a merchant that players can trade with.  The merchant doesn't even need
a tent.  There are many zones that already have a merchant in their zone so
there shouldn't be that many new merchants that need to be dropped into the
game.  Then simply allow you to do coin exchanges with merchants.  No
biggie.
