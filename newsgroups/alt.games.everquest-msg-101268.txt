This is somewhat of a poor analogy though...  Most Druid porters would
offer to port close to Gfay.  Albeit the Druid in question didn't inform
the OP this situation, the OP also didn't seem to confirm who he was
dealing with.  It is possible to be dealing with another guy, say...  a
Cleric wearing robes, who would pull a scam and pretend to port you.

Either way... Assumption on both sides was the fault, not just on one side.
