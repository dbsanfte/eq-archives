I don't think I did, either.

What I mean is, if "acquiring skills and helping others" in the real 
world were *always* more rewarding (understanding "rewarding" as the 
product of 'effort involved', 'challenge', 'enjoyment' and 'ultimate 
payoff') than doing the equivalent in the virtual world, nobody would 
want to play MMORPGs. Since a lot of people seem to play, after all, it 
follows that activities in the virtual world can indeed be more 
rewarding than in the real world.

Now, whether there is a moral judgement applicable to "I enjoy getting 
an AA point more than I enjoy spending the afternoon helping at the soup 
kitchen" is a separate issue.
