Unfortunetly, without a dedicated group looking to camp a particular
item for you, or for others, the bazaar is the only way to go to get
good items until you can raid. Because honestly, you can buy an item
better than you can get as a drop at almost any level except as a
raid. The time and effort it takes to get a specific item from most
places (of an appropriate level) is more than the effort it would take
to farm plat and buy the item in the bazaar.

There are a few exceptions to this, such as Veksar, the place drops
equipment that many of an appropriate level would find to be an
upgrade (unless they very actively farm plat and camp the bazaar).

However, if you plan to hunt in a place where you will be fighting
creatures that require magic weapons (or where such creatures might
add) you should look to get a magic weapon from somone that can summon
one, until you can get a velium weapon. Mages can summon better ones,
but you can also get a hammer from Pallys and Clerics that can cast
the Hammer of Wrath spell. Also Barb Shammans can quest a neck item
that will summon them too. I used to run around the newbie zones
dropping them on the ground. Just shout and ask for one and I'm sure
someone will drop one on you.

Also to get a velium weapon, just take the PoK stone to the Great
Divide. Stay close to the stone in case someone trains something there
that would eat you for lunch. Just shout saying that you are a new
player looking to buy a Velium weapon (if you want you can be
specific), since the weapons sell for about 5pp you could probably get
one for 5 to 10pp, or free, since many will take pity on you and let
you have one. Since you are in the GD already, you could shout out to
see if anyone is camping the Kodiaks or the Tizmaks.

If somone says to come over to the Tizmaks to get an item you are
asking for, you should be able to make it there with little trouble,
since you have not killed any of the dwarves or tizmaks, they should
all be non-KoS to you. Just look out of the giants, kodiaks, wyrms,
and the wolves aligned with the giants. Most of those stay away from
the north west of the zone where the dwarves and tizmaks are though.

There are a number of nice items that drop from the beasties in this
zone that you would find quite usefull (especially since AC and STR
are much more important to you at this level.)

If you don't find anyone killing them yet, once you gain a few levels
you could get a group togeather to camp the Tizmaks, since they drop
items that make BSTs very happy. (Shamefully, my 46th level Warrior is
still wearing the Kodiak bracers from this zone, and until yesterday
was still wearing the Tizmak arms. Though the bracers should be
upgraded soon.) I'd say about level 20 you should be able to group
well against the Tizmaks. Better than the Orcs or Gnolls of High Hold,
because they have a better spawn rate and with a few exceptions a
better loot drop. Though there is no handy zone line to run to.
