On a related note, I was soloing in CT last night, and noticed that the xp 
I was getting seemed to be about identical to what I would get soloing in 
PoN.  I was quite surprised actually, as I seemed to recall it not being 
anywhere near as good in the past.  This was on EMarr, not test.  I was 
getting 1% AAXP per kill of the zone in mobs.  In PoN, I think it works out 
to a bit more, maybe 1.3% AAXP per kill.  I did not spend enough time in CT 
to really get a good feel for whether it was a bit above or below 1%.  In 
both zones, I had xp set to 80% AAXP.
