When my friend decided to play a shaman, we started over on
Firiona Vie for the added challenge and based on rumors of a more
laid back and roleplay friendly environment.

I didn't spend a lot of time considering things, I wanted to play
a class I hadn't done recently, was nostalgic over my first real
character, a erudite mage I'd gotten to 28but in retrospect never
learned to play well, and for my very first character; a gnome
wizard I'd gotten to level 4.  Gnome and Mage, both things I've
never really done much of and certainly not at all since my first
couple months of play.

I also figured this combo might be interesting, and yet allow us
both to solo up into the higher levels.

Funny thing, though, I'm less sure of this now, having run the
mage for a while.  Mage has haste for his pet, and its a nice
long duration one too compared to what the shaman will have for
quite some time to come.  Hasting the mage isn't going to do any
good, I've completely eschewed melee, as an untwinked magician my
damage output is so ludicrously low as to be totally ignorable.
I also have a pretty good heal for my pet, at the moment shaman
heal looks to be a waste of perfectly good mana.

So this leaves her casting melee buffs on my pet, sharing the
healing duties, and working on the mobs.  Well, she can melee the
mobs, but that means we have to use real healing instead of
letting my pet regen the damage.  And that the fire pet plan
won't work since the better DS there does no good if he's not
being hit.  Or she can sit back and DOT mobs... but they tend to
die pretty fast and shaman DOTs tend to take a while for full
potency.  Or she can nuke... but shaman nukes aren't all that
good compared to mage nukes, so now she's the poor second cousin
instead of a fully compatible member of the team.

Whats left?  Slow.  Trouble with slow is, it reduces the DS
damage output.  I think, though, that that is probably a mistake
to worry about.  For one thing, it also decreases the amount of
damage the mob does over the same time period, and the DS damage
to mob damage ratio will remain constant.  For another, if her
slow is having a large effect on DS damage output over the mobs
life, I could just stop using DS.  Fire pet isn't the only
approach, Water pets do better damage and Air Pets proc stun
which has a slowing effect which would stack with shaman slow
(slowing effect in that it makes the mobs do less hitting over
their life span because they spend a part of their life standing
around doing nothing)

For slow to be a good buy, we need to go after higher level
targets that take longer to kill but yeild more exp per kill.
This would mean that her DOTs will also become worthwhile,
particularly the poison DOTs which have a relatively short
duration anyway.

So I see this plan: Air pet MA, shaman slow and DOT, mage heals
pet.

I think I'll go look for an IH 2 item, isnt' there a quest one?

Splendid One, 24 gnomage, Firiona Vie
