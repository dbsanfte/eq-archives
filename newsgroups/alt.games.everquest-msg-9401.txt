I think that the ranged weapon grays out because you're busy fighting with
your primary weapon and unable to do anything with that ranged weapon.

Example: I have a bow in my range slot, and have to turn off auto-attack to
use it. Makes sense that you can't fire a bow while swinging an axe/sword,
etc. Kinda confusing when you have a spear/dagger eqquiped.

Hope this helps.
