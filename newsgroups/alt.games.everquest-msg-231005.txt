> Dark Elves or Trolls are on faction with crushbone/deathfist/any-kind-of
orcs?

The Indigo Brotherhood (Warrior Guild) is allied with Crushbone Orcs, so
killing CB Orcs lowers your faction with them.  As far as I know, unless you
go near the warrior guildhouse though you won't have too many issues, but
then from a RP perspective, killing the allies of your home is a bit rough
after they let you into their town when your own was taken over.
