Druids are all but gone?  What crack are you smoking?  Sure they're
not the most desired class at the high end, but in my guild (minimum
level 57, 90% 60) druids are as common as any other support
characters.  Yes, we have more warriors and clerics, but our druids
are also a LOT more active than the other classes.  I just checked the
rosters of the two top guilds on my servers, and guess what, they had
more druids that wizards, shaman, sks, rangers, paladins, necros,
mages, enchanters, bards, and beastlords.  
For a class that is all but gone, there sure are a bunch of the
tree-hugging bastards.  Now if the whiny, worthless, bitching druids
were all but gone we might be getting somewhere.
