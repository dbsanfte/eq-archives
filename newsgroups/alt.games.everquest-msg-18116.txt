Well, someone in this thread doesn't...

True - however the difference is so imperceptibly small, it's negligable

This is a placebo effect. You are damage capped until L20, besides
which, 8 extra strength will not make any noticeable difference (except
to remove the penalty of being under 75str if it takes you over)

I'm L60. I'm routinely at 255 strength. Strength has a very very very
small effect other than raising the maximum you can hit for and a tiny
(1 or 2) difference in the damage bonus. There is a theory that the
relationship between your ATK and the mob's AC (and visa-versa) has an
effcet, but again, this is only relative, and not global as you suggest

Agreed, but you shouldn't compromise your tanking ability to carry more
loot.

If they are pulling, a bow is much more useful. I don't know what lower
level options there are for range items, nor the price of idols, but I
agree you should have SOMETHING there.

>At the level where

Kerran toy? I also found a nice ac2 hp3 and other stats range slot item
going through ToFS the other day. I'm sure there are more out there
