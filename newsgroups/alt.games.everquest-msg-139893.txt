Oh man, I took great pleasure in getting payback on those pesky goons.

They gave me my first lesson in FD/memblur changes post-35.. and really
terrorised my poor magician.

When I was in OT to do a part of my epic, a goon had just hit the ledge..
coming from a fight, i still had buffs and a cleric w/me, so we just engaged
and kicked his ass.

We pulled a few more goons and killed them, well until I got carried away
and got too close to the outpost.  After General V'deers (sp?) HT'd me and
came running after me, I decided it was time to stop fooling.. but full
revenge shall some day be mine!
