save those Illegible Cantrips you get from the deathfist oracles and
apprentices. They are lore and are different. Both are called cantrips
only way to tell a difference is to do identify. But if you have both,
you'll know you have one of each.  Turn them in to the wizard beside
the pond, hail him he'll talk about it.  Used to be bugged and he
asked for two of each.  Had to turn in one then get your buddy to hand
you the other to turn in. Or turn in one, run back out and hope to get
another real soon. All fixed now.

Other way, is to go alllll the way to Quenos Hills. When you get
around Surefall glade look for a pond, you'll see a player standing
there camping Haton or whatever his name.  anyways, buy a backpack
full of rat ears from inn at WC zoneline in EC, give them to the
enchanter on the dock in QH.  He will give you something that is lore,
give that right back to him and get more faction. Got my innoruuk dark
elf to kindly with the freeport casters guild this way.   You also can
give him "giant rat ears", but can't buy those in bulk.  It says you
get xp, but I tried to powerlevel a lvl 1 erudite I dragged up there
with it and the xp was minimal. Seems like from 160 rat ears I barely
got a bub.  Bought some giant ears at a vendor and got considerable
xp.

Disadvantage is it lowers some factions along the way, but seems like
was ones that are raised by slaying gnolls in blackburrow. The
cantrips don't lower any faction if I recall.

can also give the oracle cantrips to a gnome on floor 3 of Highpass,
but that only affects Ak'Anon caster faction, and seems like it lowers
something. 


Now the big mystery, how did the first person discover that the
enchanter in QH wants rat ears? He will not talk about it, noone
mentions it, the rats aren't saying anything.  I found out about the
giant rat ears working by mistake when accidently handed him one.

Also, test this out before hiking the whole way up there, make a
newbie half elf ranger or something and get a rat ear. I'm pretty it
will raise ArcaneScientists and OpalDarkbringer. Did about a year ago
for me /shrug


ps- buy the cats agates in the cleric guild in north freeport.  OR
same lady who sells the rat ears in EC also sells cats eye agate.
