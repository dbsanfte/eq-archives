Bingo - my feelings precisely.

I read AL's site the first time a few days back, and was
pretty damn impressed with the way Thott came across on
their board.  Of course, it's possible he's ranted and
raved as often as Furor and I just haven't seen it.  But
I remember thinking that if Furor and company expressed
themselves in that manner, they'd be far more respected
in the community.  Interesting thing is that Jaytee (a
FoH mage) DOES express himself well and acts in a mature
manner - which only makes Furor look worse due to the
contrast.
