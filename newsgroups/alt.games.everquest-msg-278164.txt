Something doesn't jibe.

Lucy says Winged Death went from 240/tick  to 216 (level 63) to 224 (level 67).
Duration went from 6 ticks to 9 ticks.

Not counting AAs and specializations, it went from 1440 total damage, 40 DPS,
4.11 dmg/mana to (level 63) 1944 total damage, 36 DPS, 5.45 dmg/mana. Pretty
good deal for only 7 more mana. The reduction in cast time is also very nice for
kiting classes so, yeah, it IS a BFD.

Similar numbers for Winged Death:

Either Lucy is wrong (unlikely) or the in-game descriptions are wrong (wouldn't
be the first time). Did you turn on dot damage messages to see what the real
deal is?
