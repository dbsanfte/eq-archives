Aloha,
    Gonna add a 'me too' on this thread. I had major problems with the 6.0 and
6.2 newsreader and went back to 4.7 (lost 6 years of bookmarks in the process).
6.0 and 6.2 wouldn't delete read threads many times and resurrected them the next
time I logged on. There wasn't any way to selectively do 'spell check' and worst
of all if you wished to save a posting to disk it had to be done one posting at a
time. - redvet
