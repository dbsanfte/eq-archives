I agree with everything you have to say here (except a little muddle in
your 14+5+1+10=20 math)... but the fact that twice they have referred
to this event (supposed event, haven't seen or heard a thing) as a "week"
of war leads me to hope that its being done in the style of the halloween
events.  Those were some of the most fun I've had in EQ, new exotic challenges,
things to do for all my alts and nice rewards for them, no drop so never
available to anyone who stayed away.

While the events went on long enough that some people were able to
get things down to a farming situation, logging in alts to twink by picking
up loot they had massively overkilled, I saw -lots- of people doing
mostly level-appropriate stuff and having fun at it.

Another type of GM event exists, which you didn't mention.  In this
sort of event, a high level NPC/GM shows up, and tries to interest
some people in a quest of some sort.  A crowd gathers, a core of
people who happened to be in the zone, joined rapidly by port capable
high levels from all over.  A mob scene with 70+ people throngs around
the NPC's, who aren't being clear on whats going on.  Most people
weren't in hearing range when the event started and don't even have the
clues necessary to figure out what the deliberately obtuse GMs want,
and some (5%?  10%?) are deliberately being disruptive.  Eventually
the GMs are attacked and slaughtered regardless of what the intent
of the event was, or they turn out to be invulnerable to all, and just give
up in frustration or ignore anything anyone says or does and just spit
out their rote script.  Noone gets anything, noone understands what
happened, and the time of everyone involved, GMs included, is quite
wasted.

This could be reduced to some degree by locking the zone and introducing
level appropriate content for the people who happen to be there at the
time... another approach I saw recently had a killable mob who could
only be attacked by level appropriate people.   After what, 3 years of
doing this sort of thing you'd think they'd be further along on figuring out
how to make them fun instead of just repulsive for everyone -including- GMs.

Hoping that the "week" of war isn't a "weak" of war

PS Opening of the plane of War might be whats going on... whatever that means
