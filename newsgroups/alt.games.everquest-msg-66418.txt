Lord, we can only hope it's dead.  I know not everyone has Luclin yet, but
a bazaar zone was long overdue.  I completely hate going to a zone that I
*have* to go to/through and having the screen clogged with idiots who
don't know the difference between /auc and /shout, and beggars looking for
scraps.
