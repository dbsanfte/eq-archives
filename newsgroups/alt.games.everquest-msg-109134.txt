My Halfling Druid with a SoW could not keep up with a bunch of Dwarves also
SoW'd as we ran through Lesser Faydark the other night.  In fact, even using
Greater Wolf Form he could not keep up!  We would start running and less
than a minute later everyone would be so far ahead of me I could not see
them.

He was not encumbered - in fact he was 25 lbls under his weight limit. Can
anyone tell me what the heck is going on?

Oh and finally, I do not have a slow computer or connection. I have a 2
month old 2 GHz box with 512 MB of RDRAM and a cable connection.
