Well, after sorting through this jumbled mess three times I finally
figured out what the fuck you were attempting to answer. That's why top
posting sucks.  But I'll answer you anyway.

I suppose, in theory, you could camp out (or even hit /q) and stop a
macro, but camping takes 30 seconds. When in hell are you ever going to
build a macro that runs much longer than that? For most any macro you
build, it would be done running before you finished camping anyway, or
at least mostly done. Your example is an excellent one. When I want to
max out my casting skills on my wizard after dinging, I have a macro I
use that basically does:
/pause 45,/cast 1
/pause 45,/cast 2
/pause 45,/cast 3
/pause 45,/cast 4
/doability 2  (Which is sense heading)

But as others have pointed out, you can't chain macros, so you can't
"walk away" for more than twenty seconds or so and expect to keep
getting skill increases. You have to stay there and keep hitting the
macro button every time it stops. If I hit that macro and tried to camp
immediately, I *might* finish camping during the last cast or the sense
heading check.

It's not an exploit. (Unless you tie in the current thread where some
folks are claiming that any time away from keyboard where a skill-up
happens is an exploit, e.g. swimming.) If you are at your keyboard
hitting the macro key over and over, and getting skill ups, you aren't
exploiting crap. (Yes, even if you run to refill your coffee while the
macro goes off and you get a skill up.)

As to twinks and safe spot campers, what the fuck are you referring to
in terms of exploits there?  Jesus, this post gave me a headache just
trying to wade through it.
