Sorta a rant, but SoE has me peeved.....

Ok I plan for like the last few months each part of my epic (druid)
that requires a group or raid, or as much of it as I can (VSR was
MQ'd). Now the final battle looms large tonight, and I am doing a
dance of joy because I managed to get a 65 Warrior friend, and about
10 other 60 plus friends and guildies to help, even a Mage to CoTH us
all there in TD. Then I look around and no Dolgin for the stupid turn
in. Ok I hear stories that he is on a 3-6 hour timer, then others say
24 hour timer (once Faydedar is spawned). How the heck are players
expected to do epics with only being able to have one druid a day
complete it? This make no freakin sense. I made sure to check all the
necessary major guilds for scheduled epics on that day, etc, and even
posted my time on their boards. So for future reference anyone else
trying to do this part of their epic make damn sure that you do it
EARLY, and pray no one did it the night before.
