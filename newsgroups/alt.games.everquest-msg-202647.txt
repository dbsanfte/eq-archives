Is this really that big a problem for you? Far and away my reasons for
being squeezed out of a decent xp camp are someone else's powerlevelling
sessions, high levels farming (to them) green mobs for tradeskill items
or rare drops, and overcrowding/trains. Being aced out by a spawn-hogging
soloer with KEI is pretty rare for me.
