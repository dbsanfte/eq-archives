Had to post here, since my last threads were so well-received about
being new to EQ.

I made a Halfling Paladin last week, and she just hit L11 today, and
also got the last Giant Yellowjacket drops to make the remainder of
the Bravefoot Mail armor!  No more looking like a barmaid, she looks
like a warrior!

Of course, the next task (bringing back the hands of a villain from
the Forest to the South) will take some work -- most of the assassins
are conning yellow to me now.  Maybe I'll level up a bit and try
again.

Have to get back to my Druidess, too.  Don't want to forget her.

And again, people online have been great, lots of unasked-for (and
VERY appreciated) buffs, and one character, Justafoot, actually gave
me some better blades (have been using the beginning Short Sword). 
I've been trying to use the Minor Healing spell Paladins get to help
people of even lower level than me, can't wait to get a better heal to
help out more.

I've managed to save up 15pp, maybe I can get something better in the
near future.
