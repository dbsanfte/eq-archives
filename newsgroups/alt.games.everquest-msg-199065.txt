I agree and will add that East Karana is a good place to find Griffawns,
too.  By all means stop the meleeing.  I'd focus on getting plus wisdom/mana
items rather than enhancing melee capability.  Sometimes the price on
Acrylia plus wisdom items in the bazaar is reasonable, as are the line of
Jasper(?) plus wisdom rings.  The Springwood Club is a nice 1H wisdom item
that can sometimes be found for a good price in the bazaar.  The Dark Ember
has a damage proc, but that doesn't kick in until 35, well past melee time.
