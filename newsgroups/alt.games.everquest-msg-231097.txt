There is also an Aug3 with Serpent Sight for 100 points in Miragul.

Both of those would require you to have a piece of LDoN armor to augment, 
as only LDoN armor purchased with adventure points has aug3 slots.

For augments that will fit in most any armor:

For 510 points there is a Aug7 UV in MMC.

Of course, at level 48, 510 points is a fair number of adventures, even 
at 65, that's 10 adventures.

Your best bet if you decide on LDoN augments is to find a low point piece 
of armor that is decent for you, and put the Serpent Sight augment on it.  
Maybe a low cost earring or ring, make sure it has a type 3 augment slot.

It's probably a downgrade for you, but something like:

Tak, 10 points, Sculptor's Hoop, AC:3, Agi:5, type1,type3  

Search through the database at 
http://www.squidbox.com/skp/eq/ldon/list.cgi to see if you can find 
something that works for you.
