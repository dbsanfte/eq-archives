They're still vital for <12 level mages to hunt wisps - since the
level 8 pet can't hit magic creatures :-P

Also, doesn't the grimling mining pick have a killer ratio, but is
non-magic?

We won't even mention how my bard killed wisps back in the first
month of release.  I'd go grab a couple, then run them down to the
desert of EC and run back and forth from wall to wall twisting
Selos, Hymn, CoD - if you ziz-zag you can keep the wisps in range
while not getting tagged more often than hymn can fix.  Then I
payed a *HUGE* 15pp for a tentacle whip (4/25, procs lifetap) and
thought I'd died and gone to heaven, until the first time it procced
and my song buttons got stuck.
