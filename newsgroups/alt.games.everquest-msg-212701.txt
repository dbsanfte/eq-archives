"Upcoming for August 26th, 2003



Plane of Mischief changes going to the Legends.  The Plane of Mischief, 
home of the trickster Bristlebane, has undergone an extensive revamp.  
As one of the most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone will 
be a very interesting challenge, if you have a sturdy funny bone.

 

 

Partial Zone Revamps coming to all servers.  These changes are not as 
dramatic as those made to the Plane of Mischief, but they are great 
improvements to these zones that needed only a little modification to 
make them much better.  The zones we'll be updating this week are: The 
Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The 
Hole, The City of Mist, The Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule and 
Velketor's Labyrinth.  Gameplay in these zones has been improved, based 
on feedback from players and careful review of the content.

 

New filters and chat message options will be added.  We will be 
separating pet melee messages into their own category.  You will be able 
to send them to whichever chat window you want, or filter them out 
completely in the Options window.  We have also added the ability to 
send /random messages to any chat window you'd like.  There is no option 
to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the 
information in cases where it is needed.

 

Memorizing spell sets.  We will be adding /memspellset # to make 
memorizing spells a bit less bothersome.  Using this command will 
memorize one of your saved spell sets.  # is the number or name (or 
shortened name) of the spell set you wish to memorize.  Note that if you 
use a shortened version of the spell set name, it will match the first 
spell set that has those characters, so /memspellset Dots will find your 
"Dots and Charms", or "Dots", or "Dotsandstuff" - whichever shows up 
first on your list.

 

Shared Bank gains a Plat slot.  We will be adding a Platinum slot to the 
shared bank to make transactions between characters on the same account 
more convenient.

 

Rain Spells can be deadly.  Rain Spells have been resisted 100% of the 
time when an NPC was above level 20 and had less than 10% of its hit 
points left.  We will be removing this restriction.

 

 

Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user 
interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect 
to change next week.
