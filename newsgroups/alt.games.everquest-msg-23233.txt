okay i know this hugely lame of me.

i'm advised this a pretty good game.
but then it costs a lot to play over the years!

is there any demo or 'trial' period for everquest?

i would like to try but i don't want to shell out cash for a game that after
installing i decide is naff and never play again ...

any advise greatly appreciated.

regards
