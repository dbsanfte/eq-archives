I only play one account, but I have noticed a very significant increase in
packet loss since the last patch.  I now run with packet loss varying
anywhere from 10% to 95% or so.  It makes playing a lot more difficult to
say the least.  I am still pursuing the possibility that it is my ISP.
Given that quite a few of my friends online are having similar problems, I
have to start to wonder if the problem is not on Verant's side.
