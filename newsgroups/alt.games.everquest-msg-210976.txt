Having the same problems.  I also get this problem where the top left
hotkey flickers and the mouse is unresponsive.  Pressing CTL-ALT-DEL
then restoring is the only way I've found to fix it.  At least they
fixed the bug where in the character selection screen where the mouse
cursor would always freeze in the top left corner of the screen.
