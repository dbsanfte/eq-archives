Yeah welcome to Prexus.. just think back to the email I sent you a while
back heh, same people..

The thread was pretty damn good though, fastest growing flame I've
personally seen (tho it fizzled out after only a few days)

As a side thought tho, im sure you can gather from the 2 sets of posts the
jist of what went on in VT..  what are your views, and how did your server
handle multiple guilds contesting it?

Yes, Elwren.  I assume you looked at
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260851

When I was talking to him about hp/comparing with yours, he said his magelo
was horribly out of date (but when I look now his shawl is updated, and that
was recent)

I didn't get the figures from magelos, I was going by "whats your hp at?"
"mines at xxxx"  "mines at xxxx" that people were saying 1 night in a guild
channel.

Btw if you didn't see my otherpost, I corrected myself after speaking with
him, your at the sameish hp (I thought he was at 6k, but he's at 5.75)

As for killing Aten.. well he died alright, to the hands of a gm though
(some 3 hours after the contesting guild had left the zone)... but that was
the first run at him, so no we haven't yet.  Seru down first try tho, in
other recent news :)
