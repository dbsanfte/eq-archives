Well, one way I know of is to make the mistake of tackling a mob that can
charm.  GMs have, at times, replaced an item lost in this fashion, although
it is not the norm.  Fortunately, most, if not all, of the nice range slot
weapons I can carry cannot be thrown, so I don't run into that problem
myself.  I believe that in her case the problem was that it looked just like
some other stackable thrown weapon, I don't really know.  Yes, this was a
case of carelessness, and she did not expect it to be replaced, but it was
worth a try.  The only reason I brought it up was to mention that the logs
they keep are not necessarily as good as one would hope, not to discuss
whether or not it should have been replaced.
