    All of your hotkeys work when blind. So if you had Feign on your hotkey
bank, turn off auto-attack and feign and you'll be fine. Unless you just
fall to the ground, which you can't tell except from the sound. =) When I
duel once I get the opponent Blind I cast ITU on myself to clear their
target box, or else they can keep nuking me.
