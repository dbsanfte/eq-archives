In the abstract, I suppose I agree with you.  In this specific case
I would really like to be able to get my HS key in some fashion other
than sitting around doing nothing while waiting for somebody else's
table scraps.  I really really hate that sort of thing, I don't pay
$13 a month to roleplay "dog at the masters table".  I found it just
as detestable with the stupidity of the Crazed Goblins in BBM, "Here
let's set up this Paladin quest drop as a nolife dr00ds wet dream:
easy to rot mobs in a nice little outdoor camp with nothing nearby
that's any sort of threat".  Actually, in the more general case, I
think EQs quests overall generally rate the evaluation:  "WTF?  This
load of crap is supposed to be fun?  Bite me you pathetic brain-dead
wannabe pimps!".  But then, that's just me.
