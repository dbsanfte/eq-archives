Twelve is the level where I moved to Ocean of Tears and have done most
of the last ten levels there. At thirteen, if you find the alluring
sirens uncamped, you can easily hold the three spawn of them, along with
whacking the aqua goblins that live on the same spire as the single
spawn. They will occasionally drop decent weapons for your pet. In the
same zone you can hunt the sisters on Sisters' Isle, providing you don't
care about your elf faction. (and who does, really?). Better loot off
the purity belts and occasional cash. When they are greening out, you
can go elsewhere or hunt *some* of the isle goblins there on the same
island as the Oracle. But you must be careful in your selections for
pulling and con carefully.
  At 18 you can start tackling Gargoyles, but bring a lot of bonechips
because you'll want to cast until you have the *maximum* pet every time
and equip him well. The gargs can take you a long way. I'm still hunting
them at 22 when I get time.
