okay, assuming you haven't remapped your keyboard in game etc. (doubtful
as a newbie)  When you click on a mob, press the c key to con it, or you
can right click on the mob.  It will tell you how it considers you.  It
will be green, blue, white, yellow or red.  Green is approx 5 or more
levels below you, blue is 1 to 5 levels below you, white is same level
as you, yellow is 1 to 3 levels above you and red is 4 or more levels
above you.  I am sure that someone can point you to a better more
accurate description that what I just gave off the top of my head. 

 Also are you not looting your corpse?  When you die, you can loot your
corpse and whatever is on it, will be there still.  At levels 1-5 it
lasts for 30 minutes.  At 6 and up it lasts for 24 hours online, or 7
days offline.

If having trouble finding your corpse use the /loc command esp if it
looks like youre going to die.  You can then make your way back to your
corpse.
