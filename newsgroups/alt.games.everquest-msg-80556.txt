Well, if you haven't been to Velious before you should have no faction
problems in Thurgadin itself.

I assume you have looked at EQAtlas ...

You can get to Thurgadin safely if you have SoW/Lev/Camo - but be wary of
Wolf Form as the Pirate Dwarves in Iceclad will kill you, and possibly the
Thurgadin/Great Divide Dwarves as well, not sure.

From NRo take the raft to Iceclad. At the Desert Island cross to the dock
and wait for the Icebreaker ship. Take that to the dock amongst the
icebergs. NO WOLF FORM.

SoW/Lev/Camo. Run along the south coast of the three islands then up and
across the bridge.

In Eastern Wastes, refresh SoW/Lev/Camo as necessary, turn right off the
bridge and follow the coast round, eventually head south to the Great Divide
zone. You need Lev up as it can be a long fall to the zone if you get the
approach wrong! Note you can actually run straight off the bridge, across
the zone, and turn north, but following the coast is safer and doesn't take
much longer.

In GD, refresh Camo as necessary, head straight out until you hit the river,
and turn right to get to Thurgadin.

Your biggest problem (apart from falls if you don't Lev) will be if Camo
wears off at a bad time. In normal circumstances nothing you meet should see
invis.
