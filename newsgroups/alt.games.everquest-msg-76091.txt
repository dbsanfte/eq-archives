If you have SoL installed, then you can port up to The Nexus from the Wizzy
spires in North Karana, Dreadlands, Toxxulia Forest, and Greater Faydark.
Anyone can do that, it's on something like a 30 minute cycle.  Once in the
Nexus, you can teleport down to any of those four destinations, again on
something like a 30 minute cycle.  Usually has taken me 15 to 30 minutes to
do one cycle of tping up then down.  You have to use the wizzy spires for
the Nexus ports, the druid circles do not do that.  To use the port up to
The Nexus, hail the Nexus Scion in the middle of the wizzy spires, and say
"I want to journey to Luclin" (well work "journey to luclin" into whatever
you say anyway).  He will give you a shard, stay in the spires, and wait.
To port back down, just go to the teleport pad next to the Scion with the
name appropriate to your destination (Odus, Faydwer, Kunark, or Antonica),
and wait on the pad until it activates.  There is no danger in The Nexus
zone.  Of the four locations on Norrath, the most dangerous of them is
probably NK, what with wandering animals, griffs and such.

Other than those four locations, you will need either a Wizard or a Druid to
teleport you to either a Wizard Spire, a Druid Circle, or a Portal in
Velious.
