Save your one-liners, punk.  He already said he had done well in Econ 1 and
Econ 2.  I know the Econ 101 joke made you laugh each time you saw it on
your favorite ten sitcoms.  But Econ 1 and 2 are the more advanced classes
and require fluency in the concepts of Econ 101 as a prerequisite.  Just go
back to your "Pot.  Kettle.  Black." bullshit, will you?  It's annoying too,
but at least it doesn't make you look quite as stupid.
