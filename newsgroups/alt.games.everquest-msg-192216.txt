Weird.  I get the impression you're talking about in groups.  If you 
expected that on my server, people would wonder what you're smoking.  And 
it's not new, it's always been that way.  Clerics are generally given a 
lot of leeway on loot, but actually thinking everyone in your group who 
should be symboled is going to carry components around with them?  That's 
just off the wall.  The peridots I carry are for runing, and I will part 
with some for the cleric if they happen to be out for some reason, but I'm 
certainly not expecting to get paid back even if I burn through half a 
stack of dots runing.

But then, nobody ever remembers that rune even takes a dot. :)

See, ultimately, most clerics I suspect would -prefer- that their tank be 
symboled.  It's about saving -you- mana and making your cheal more 
efficient.  Which ultimately makes the whole group more efficient.  It's 
about preventing downtime when you have to swap in rez.  And possibly rez 
yourself as well, since the tank went down.

Don't bother wasting a dot on me anymore if it means so much to you, 
though.  I have my lovely componentless self rune now. :) Besides, you're 
just going to overwrite my PotG and cost me mana regen.

On the other hand, if you're not talking about in a group, get paid first.
Simple as that.
