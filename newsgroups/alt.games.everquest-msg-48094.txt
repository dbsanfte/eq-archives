Also note that it goes by the account. So if you die as Biffle the
halfling rogue, and log off without getting your corpse to play Roxie
the high elf paladin on the same account, Biffle's corpse is going to
be poofing after 24 cumulative hours of playing Roxie or any other
character you have on the same account.
