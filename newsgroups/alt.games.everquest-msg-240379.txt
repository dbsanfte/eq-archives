Well, at 30pp per leather padding (and in fact selling them for
40-50pp isn't hard), the padding alone costs nearly as much as most
ornate gold combines do, so it still seems the cheapest way to me, on
my server.  Consider that, even if you do farm yourself, you could
sell the padding for plat to finance the ornate gold combines, rather
than do FP combines, and come out ahead.

This is true on The Tribunal, I don't know about other servers.
