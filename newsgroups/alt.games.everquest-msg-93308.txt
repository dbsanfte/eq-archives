Ok, I have leveled my monk to 8 and got a full set of
Wu's armor as a semi-twink.  I have a few questions
regarding skills:  

Now that I have Round Kick, do I still need to practice/use 
Kick? (same for Dragon vs Round I guess).

Does Instill Doubt rely on your kick level? (not sure where
I got that one from...)

Should I be using strictly H2H stuff at the moment?

What about when I get an awesome (insert non-H2H weap here)- 
won't my skill be so low that raising it will be horriffic?

Do monks get any way to interrupt casters like slam/bash?

I think thats it... Thanks in advance for answering my tedious
n00b questions.
