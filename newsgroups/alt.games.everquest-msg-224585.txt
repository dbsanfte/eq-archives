   I remember being bored one day and killing a bunch of mobs in the Qeynos
newbie garden.  Then I started giving out snake eggs to the bats, bone chips to
the gnolls, rat whiskers to the skeleton, and so on.  Didn't take very long for
my screen to fill up with /ooc chatter about the messed up bug in the loot
table.

   This isn't as good as your story, of course, but I was in no position to be
handing out Velium weapons.

   Side question.  It would proc in the hands of a level 4 fire beetle?  MoBs
ignore proc levels?  Interesting.
