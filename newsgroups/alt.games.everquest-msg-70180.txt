Having not played a Pally, I guess I'll have to take your word for it
and say that's possible, but allow me to ask..... What kind of gear do
you have on that Pally to solo the cougars at that level?

That said, the OP is not a pally. He's a warrior, and a main (untwinked)
from the sound of it. He's not going to be soloing those cougars unless
they are the *lowest* level of blue to him, so conning exceedingly
carefully will be critical, and the downtime will be horrific. Oh, and
he'd better have a weapon that procs a snare and be very lucky. I found
they tend to run right for their friends. Not to mention that one
overpull will be a corpse run. Of course, now that they made the dock a
bindable point, that's not as much of a concern as it used to be.
