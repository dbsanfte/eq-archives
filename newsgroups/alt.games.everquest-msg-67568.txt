I have no idea what you're on about, but let's just assume you're right.
Now go back and read what I wrote. (Including the part you snipped out,
but also even the part you left in.) The supposition was that the effect
of the subject spell was to allow the target to cast any given spell as
if they were some number of levels higher. I gave the specific examples
of necros and wizards casting DD's. (Being the only two caster classes
with DD's that I've played to any decent level.) I then followed it up
with:

If you are a 24th level necro and cast shock of poison, you get a
maximum of "x" damage to the target per cast. Might be less, might be
"x". If you cast IS on that necro, and now let's say that he's casting
like a 28th level necro, he'll have the chance of doing "x + 4" damage
to the target. That's assuming he get's the max.  That's the "many
cases" I was referring to. And in those cases of casters using DD's as
their primary attack mode, this spell would be a wasted buff on them.
