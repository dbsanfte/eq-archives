Go thru the top of BB to everfrost, and hunt the bears there.  You'll
find the cubs trivially easy to kill, and they drop pelts a plenty.
ditch the ruined ones, or take up tailoring, but sell the low quality
for 2pp, MQ for 3pp, and the HQ for 20pp each.  Now that they
are stackable, this means you can go spend an evening and come
out with 40pp or so all stacked up nice and tidy, and wait for a
tailor to come along buying.  Sensible tailors know that everfrost
is the best place to find pelts, so you shouldn't have too long to
wait.

Take it a step further, and also decimate the wolly spiderling
population, collect up the spiderling silks.  You can sell those
to the same tailors, or make threads with them, and then
combine with the LQ pelts to make leather backings, which
sell for 5pp each to smiths quite readily... but you won't
find many smiths in the qeynos area who are up to FS plate
levels.

You can also kill the wolves for thier pelts, but since there
is no comperable HQ pelt market for them, it might be
better to stick to bears.

Bears also drop white pelts occaisionally which can be
turned in for exp, faction, and armor that sells for a few
gold, from the lady in Mac's Kilts in Halas.

There are also skellies by the metric tonne in everfrost,
but if you want to collect bone chips for money, you
might as well do the ruins in QH, where you will also
see exp.
