In this part, I think you are both correct and incorrect, see below.

This part however is extremely doubtful.  History just does not bear you
out.   When epic weapons first came out, they were attainable only by those
in uber raiding guilds.  It was not until the end of Velious, a full
expansion later, that a non raiding guild could even dream of completing one
for one of thier members.   And not until the end of Luclin that the epic
was a serious option for a player in any guild.   PoP is the era where they
became single groupable.

I suspect the situation with epics is going to be similar to Kunark.   They
will be bleeding edge weapons, but in order to complete them your raiding
guild will have to have conquered a sizable portion of OOW, if not all of
it.  As with old VP drops, endzone OOW drops will probably be equal but
different from epics, or slightly better but not enough to worry about.
They will likely be eclipsed in the next expansion, and sneered at in the
expansion after that (when normal players finally start to get them.)  but
for now they're going to be top of the heap.

IMO, epic 2.0 will not be the big draw for OOW, it will be the uberguild
dream for the next while.  Epic 1.5 will be the real draw for the common
player(1).   Turn in your old epic, do a few questy bits or an easy raid and
end up with an upgraded version (an intermediate step of the 2.0 quest) that
is comparable to Time level gear, but not even close to being as good as the
final 2.0 epic.

(1) Only speaking itemwise of course.   Level 70 will probably be the bigger
selling point they will go after.
