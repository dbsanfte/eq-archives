Chanters just received a hellatious nerf in god zones when they where
*improved* . The level of mobs has been set outside the level requirements
for the pacify line of spells and the charm line of spells.

No more chanter pets hitting for 1100 hasted :(

This incidently made god zones out of reach of most people. Before you could
do tipt and vxed with any cleric,chanter,ranger . Now they actually have to
have gear.
