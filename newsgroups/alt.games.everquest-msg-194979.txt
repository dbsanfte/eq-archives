While many people have posted wild schemes for getting the AC in SRo up, I've
never seen anyone claim its easier to find him than a seafury cyclops in OOT.
You are probably thinking of the AC spawn in OOT, which might take longer than
the SRo one if you have some magic method, but is hardly difficult to find: PH
or AC spawns every 6 minutes like clockwork on one well known spot, which is a
respected camp on most servers.

The post you are responding to, though, is almost certainly not talking about
the AC, but rather Seafury Cyclops from the next island over.  Similar to
killing Hill Giants in Rathe, but with a lot more spawns in a much smaller
area.  They drop less cash but frequent gem drops bring the income level up to
the same range if you have a decent charisma (spring for a couple charisma mugs
if you don't, they are cheap and well worth it if you buy and/or sell a lot
with vendors)

A fun trick if you can handle it is to camp AC and pull Seafuries over to his
island to kill between spawns of the PH, best of both worlds; average 25pp per
clops plus a shot at a 5Kpp drop if you dont' need JBoots yourself (heck, I
guess its worth 5Kpp if you keep it instead of having to buy the MQ, so 5Kpp
either way)
