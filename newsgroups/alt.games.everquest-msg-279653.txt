I've grown bored with the xp grind on my moderately twinked alts, just 
trying to get them up to a level equivalent to that of their Bazaar-
purchased gear where I can begin the fun part - questing and adventuring 
for items that are and actual upgrades. I've tried starting fresh on a new 
server, but it's tough going if you don't have others to play with who are 
of the same mindset or in the same boat.

That said, is there any interest here in starting up a "no twink" guild 
with all new characters, preferrably on a server that is new to everyone? 
I know, I know, people have different ideas of what constitutes twinking, 
so that would be up for discussion, but some of the few core rules might 
include:

- No purchasing of weapons or armor
- No extravagant gifting of weapons, armor or items
- No farming beyond supporting your own tradeskills, faction or questing
- No inappropriate-level buffs

Wouldn't it be nice for many more of the mobs you kill to have the chance 
to drop actual gear upgrades for you rather than what you now consider 
vendor trash? This would be a great opportunity for like-minded people to 
get together and maybe once again experience the satisfaction of obtaining 
that Shiny Brass Shield or maybe a Forest Loop. It would also be a 
fantastic environment for new players, providing them a more even playing 
field. It would give us an opportunity to get out of the rut and re-visit 
some old world content that some of us may never have even seen the first 
time(s) around.

Naturally, it would be expected that most people would continue playing 
their mains on other servers, so this would be considered an "alt" 
endeavor, at least initially. 

Anyone interested? Obviously this won't appeal at all to some people, so 
it'd be cool if we could just forego any criticisms in favor of positive 
dialog.
