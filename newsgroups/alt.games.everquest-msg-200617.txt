Just keep in mind Evocation will not go over 50 until you have put at least 
one point into each of the other specializations.  So, get it up to 50, put 
one point in each of the others, then nuke until it hits 51, you will be 
set.  Alternatively, just play your wizard after putting one point in each, 
and Evocation will naturally rise to the top.  Well, unless you are trying 
to fizzle fizzle fizzle summon a familiar.
