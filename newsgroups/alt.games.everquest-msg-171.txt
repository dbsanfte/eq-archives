Cyrix did work pretty stable in a situation I did just over a year ago.
October 1999, Cyrix processor about a year old.
Cyrix 686 233MHz
32 MB 66MHz RAM (168 pin)
10 GB Western Digital hard drive (split into partitions, C: was 2 GB).
Windows 95 SR2
56K Lucent Winmodem
On board sound chip
Trident 9680 video card (think 4 MB)
Had windows running 38 programs at the same time, including Internet
Explorer 5, and NetZero ISP (with their add banner), Norton Utilities and
Norton Antivirus, almost every software on my hard drive (to get to the 38
programs running at once). Ended up with a 137 MB swap file (I hadn't set
it, Windows made it that big because it was needing it), pictures on
buttonbar in Windows Explorer and other programs were no longer visible (to
free up resources which I'd quickly use up again), all fonts went back to
Windows default (again to free resources), no more alternate text messages
(like when you hold the mouse over something and it pops up text in that
yellow box), very slow movement of anything, heard my hard drive reading and
writing like it was about to fall appart, playing MP3s in WinAmp, Norton
Utilities freaking out over my usage of system resources, ALT+TAB would take
nearly 30 seconds for the ALT+TAB window to appear, another few seconds for
the box to move from one picture to another, and another 30 seconds to
switch to that program. Surprisingly I got the SWAP file up to 141 MB but
when I tried to get a screen capture Windows could only say "OUT OF SYSTEM
RESOURCES" message and started complaining that I had too much running and
needed to close a few things.  Surprisingly Windows didn't crash, though my
fonts as well as some graphics and a few programs were total permanent FUBAR
until I formatted 4 weeks later (after seeing that this couldn't be
repaired).  I also had a few problems with more errors, some said it could
have been damage to the CPU (from overuse).  Well I had been planning on
upgrading anyway.  I got a AMD K6-2 450MHz from someone I knew at whole sale
price $62 (November 1999).
However my Athlon GHz has had two of WinRAR running, each rejoining over 500
MB worth of files (one was 5 MB splits the other was almost 10 MB splits)
while an AVI editor was converting a 2 hr AVI file from one codec to
another, and Real Encoder was converting the same AVI into real player
format, while NewsBin Pro was downloading 8 files at a time at about 8 MB
per minute (DSL line) and had a list of about 1,000 files left to go, while
Outlook Express checking for mail every 3 minutes, and me browsing in
Internet Explorer 5 while playing MP3s in WinAmp and very little slow down.
Athlon GHz
256 MB (128x2) 100 MHz RAM
VooDoo3 3500 AGP 16 MB vdieo card
Sound Blaster Live sound card
Western Digital 5400 RPM 30 GB hard drive
Maxtor 5400 RPM 45 GB hard drive
DSL internet connection (going through a DSL router)

Some say I sometimes overkill on use of system resources.
