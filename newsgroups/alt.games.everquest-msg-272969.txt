Examples would go a long way for you here. The burden of proof is on 
you. I have the U.S. and state constitutions, not to mention common 
sense saying otherwise. You've got nothing.

I never claimed it didn't. I merely stated that even where none had been 
broken, a claim is made that it had.

The fact that you believe that people are just thrown in jail without 
any claim of justice, valid or not, just proves your *own* lack of 
knowledge about how things work.

I'll allow for the fact that in some backwoods towns somewhere. Some red 
neck cop probably threw some long-hair in jail to teach him a lesson and 
convince him to get out of town. Even in such cases, however, an officer 
would have to be mentally retarded not to claim it was for vagrancy or 
something to cover their own butt. Heck, they may not have even told the 
detainee what the charges where.

Any claim that an omission of that nature is commonplace is quite naive.

You said they deserved jail time for doing so. It was a complete 
overreaction on your part. Then you proceeded to attempt to justify 
jailing them on such grounds by establishing precedence based on 
ficticious anecdotal evidence.
