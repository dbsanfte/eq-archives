I got that drop quite often, killing spiders out near the windmills and near the
minotaur caves.  Might be you are killing spiders that are too small, this was a
problem for some of my drops, either the mobs were too low to drop them at all,
or they just had it very rare compared to higher level mobs further from
AkAnon.  Certainly got lots of the things to drop, of course they were useless
for a gnomage.

Splendid
