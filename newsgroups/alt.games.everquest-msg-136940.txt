Secondary effects.  The attack was designed to affect primarily the
U.S.  If it was Japan they were pissed at, they would have attacked

You realize, don't you, that Afghanistan is still controlled by
Afghanis.  The Northern Alliance regained control.  They're Muslim. 
Your thesis is not supported by the facts.  "The Muslims hate us because
