There are 4 items that double as instruments

  Troubadour's Mace - Brass
  Malarian Wing Blade - Wind (26 delay, 16 damage, some stats)
  Tear Shaped Ring - String (wear on finger, 7 AC, 10 Dex, 10 Cha, 50HP)
  Battle Drummer's Main Gauche - Percussion (17 delay, 11 damage, some
      stats)

I have the Mace also, but I've got to get the ring and main gauche.
