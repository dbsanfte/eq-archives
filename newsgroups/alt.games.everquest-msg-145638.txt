Interesting.  I tend to quad kite when soloing, so I look with interest to
see how my XP in this situation varies.  Will Cobalt Scar cease to be
perma-camped by druids and wizards?

[snip rest of resistance stuff]

Now this looks like it has potential.  Again, it will be interesting to see
how the damage I take starts to change!

Have they unnerfed the ability to cast Bind Sight on a mob and explore
an entire dungeon with it?  (by essentially leap-frogging mobs?)

Nice, but where is the ability to move and entire page of spells at a time?

Hah, brilliant. :)

Yay, wizard epic fixed then.  For those that didn't know, completing your
Epic a while back made you KoS to all True Spirit NPCs.  This could naturally
get a bit messy in some zones.

"Congratulations on completing your Epic!  Now, let me kill you!"

I look forward to hearing how this works, and I hope they haven't
trivialised this part of the Cleric epic, yet left other epics similarly
"broken" in terms of mob contention.

Lots of stuff, I look forward to seeing how it pans out.

Tris.
