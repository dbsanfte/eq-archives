Generally something along the line of:

   Joe_newbie tells you, "Excuse me, fine Knight, could I have a moment
       of your time?"
   You tell Joe_newbie, "Sure, what can I do for you?"
   Joe_newbie tells you, "Are you sure I'm not bothering you?"
   You tell Joe_newbie, "What do you need?"
   Joe_newbie tells you, "Can you spare any plat for my level 9 spells?"
   You tell Joe_newbie, "I'm sorry, I don't do donations."
   Joe_newbie tells you, "Then do you have any equipment that I might
        be able to use?  I'm getting beat up a lot."
   You tell Joe_newbie, "I have a Burynai Hide Cap that's not bad at all
        for someone your level, you can have that."
   Joe_newbie tells you, "What are the stats on it?"
   You tell Joe_newbie, "AC 5, AGI+2, WIS+2."
   Joe_newbie tells you, "Nah, I already have a Skull-Shaped Barbute."

   /em gnashes his teeth

   [Not long later:]

   Joe_newbie tells you, "I'm thinking of junking this character and
      starting another one, what class, race, and religion would
      you recommend, and how should I distribute the starting stats?"

   [And not two minutes later:]

   Joe_newbie tells you, "I'm in trouble down at the newbie ramp, come
      heal me and buff me, hurry."

...and it never stops.  Once you open the "what can I do for you" door,
they feel free to make every demand on you they can think of.

Oh, and earlier this evening I had a level 12 Shadow Knight beg me
for any spare cash while he was wielding a Drakkel Icereaver...
