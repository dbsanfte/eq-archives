What people are failing to spot here, is that whether or not the seller owns
the plat, and whether or not it is theirs to sell, you are paying for
exclusive use of that plat. Once you've bought the plat, no-one else on the
planet can touch it, except Sony (who we already know don't give a toss
about buying plat online, regardless of the EULA). So unless your analogy
with the bridge (and all the others out there, shirts, cars) somehow means
that once payment has been made the buyer gets complete and utter exclusive
use of the bridge, then please find another analogy, as this one worn thin a
couple of days ago..

It's the service of providing the plat that is being bought, not the plat
itself.
