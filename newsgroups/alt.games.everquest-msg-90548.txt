Dawnshroud peaks is a great outdoors for lvl 30-45 or so (even getting exp
from the rockhoppers at lvl 55). Mardus Seru (spelling?) is good for just
below that level. Scarlet Desert, Tenebrous Mountains, Twilight Sea, The
Grey; all good outdoor hunting zones for just about any group and loads of
spots to set up camp.

For non-luclin: Greater Divide (giant fort, tizmaks, wurm cave front & end),
Wakening Lands (get your CoV or Kael faction up first though :), Rathe Mnts,
OOT (2 groups of appropriate level per island easy, try it), Unrest (sort
of), Butcherblock Mountains (loads of camps).

Sure, not every zone is the same as OT or DL, but doing always the same only
gets boring. Tenebrous Mnts and The Grey are closest to DL and OT though,
and especially The Grey will get you to 60 after DL with practically the
same gameplay.

Well, AoE groups are amazing but also very dangerous if you're trying for
the first few times. Pulling 4+ blue mobs and having the stuns resisted WILL
get you killed. But it's like fearkiting of necro's, or kiting by druids, if
the main spells get resisted or don't work you're srewed and it's CR time.
Don't forget the AoE'ers are all utter wimps who have a hard time staying
alive with just 1 mob pounding on them.

Amen to that. Best exp groups usually don't have clerics and more often then
not not even warriors. Only last night I was in a killer group with a shammy
as sole healer and a SK as main tank. 2 rogues and me (mage) ploughed
through the mobs in FG like you wouldn't believe. Later on we added a druid,
but that was just for fun (and she was a guildie of mine :)

And on a related note, the best "group" I ever had was with a druid, a necro
and me (mage). 2 dotters, 2 pets, nuke, fear and snare. This was in skyfire
and we literally cleared the mobs as far as we could see (clipping plane
max). The druid was keeping the various named spawnpoints clear (3 as far as
we know) and they are on a 2 minute timer or such.
The fun part was that having 3 mobs feared was no problem; the dots would
bring them down slowly and the pets were finishing them off one at a time.
Epics helped a lot in mana-free casting though :)
