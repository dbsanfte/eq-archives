Woo hoooo!  Found it today.  I had given up hope, was going off to do
something, Shadow Wolf crossed my path, boom.  Shadow Wolf Paw.  It is
NOT no drop.  I could have dropped it all day long.  Vendor was willing
to give me two gold or eight gold or something, don't remember.
Needless to say, I didn't sell the darned thing, lol.

The Paw was on a SHADOW WOLF (Misty's et al may drop them as some
others say, but this was a Shadow Wolf) in West Karanas at /loc
-2829.23, -11939.72, 4.53, at Game Time /time ~6am.

Hope that helps someone else.  I searched for weeks for the thing.
