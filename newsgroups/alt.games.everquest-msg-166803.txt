This is basically accurate, but the system still has
its problems; there tends to be fierce competition
for marginal electorates and independent candidates
almost never wind up with a seat. In the last federal
election we wound up with a similar situation with the
US presidentials, where the party in power actually
received less of the first-party-preferred vote.
Basically because in non-marginal electorates they
received fewer votes.

Federally, it's proportional on a per-state basis.
So each state gets 7 (I think) representatives
regardless of population. But those 7 are elected
proportionally, with a system in place for
redistributing the preferences of those who fall
below 1/7 of the vote.

The fact that it's proportional by state means that
we occasionally get some very odd people controlling
the balance of power in the senate.

It is not compulsory to vote in Australia. It is
compulsory to attend the ballot box. Failure to vote
by deliberately messing up the ballot is an esteemed
tradition. As is a "donkey vote", numbering the boxes
in order.

Or you can pay a fine (A$50; I got stung by this
last year in a local election which I completely
forgot about until after the polls closed.)

Basically there are two papers (for federal/state
elections)
(1) House of Representatives - about half a dozen
candidates, numbered by preference
(2) Senate - you can either select one box which
then basically votes the "party line" for that party,
or else number *all* of the remaining boxes. There
were 147 or something for the last Federal election
as I recall. This thing is, seriously, the size of a
small tablecloth.

I tend to go the number-everything route, which is very
tedious. Failing to number every box invalidates the
vote, so you need to be very careful doing this. :-)
