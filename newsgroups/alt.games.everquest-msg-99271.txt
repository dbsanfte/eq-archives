I believe he did this as well, though I wouldn't testify to it in a court of
law.

It reminded me of when I picked up 1HS with my druid at 36.  Wait until the
rygorr turned, then flail wildly at it  with the Velium Scimtar I just
looted off his buddy, hoping to nick it and cause death by blood loss
(assuming the orc was a hemophiliac).

Back to the topic, typically I would be able to save those training for
tradeskills.  If you're now (almost) required to use those trainings for
combat skills, it creates an interesting balancing act.
