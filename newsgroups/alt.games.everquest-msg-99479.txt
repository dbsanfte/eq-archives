A quick analysis based on new info.

New tests have shown the earring to be the mana reducer.
The choker is not, but has a chance of eliminating component
usage.

The earring only works on damage spells (DD's, Dot's
and rains cause it to glow.)

The early tests show a 10% reduction in mana cost
on damage spells.  Since a damage caster's DPH is
mana regen dependent, this results in a net 11%
increase in their DPH.  The first earring is summonable
at level 12, and only works on spells up to 34th,
the second is summonable at 34 and works on spells up
to 51 (or 52). The third is at 52 and works on spells
up to 60.

Next, the bracer (these two are the essentials
for a damage caster).  It has a max damage bonus
of 20%, I've seen 0 or near 0 bonuses.  If it's
evenly distributed (no reason to think not) then
the average damage bonus is 10%.  Bracers only
work on DD's, not Dot's or Rains.  This has the
effect of increasing a damage caster's output by
10%.  The first is summonable at 20th, the second
at 44 the last at 54.  They have the same restrictions
on spell level as the earring - the highest spell
affected is the same level as the next summons, or
60 for the highest.

So, beginning at 20th a mage can increase a damage
caster's output by 21%.  

Let's compare that to a similarly leveled enchanter's
ability to affect melee damage output - quickness 
has a range of 28% to 30% - a direct boost to DPH.

They also have breeze, which adds 14%-25%* to a similarly
leveled caster's mana regen (directly affecting damage
caster's dph, but also affecting a wider variety of spells.)

*15%-25% is based on 2 per tick increase, and med skill/10
for mana regen (which is what mine appears to be).  So a
16th level caster has 8per tick (25% increase with breeze),
a 28th level caster has 14 per tick (~14% boost with breeze).

So, are mage summoned focus items overpowered?  They have
the highest relative power at level 20, and still aren't
overpowered.  By level 54, they still only represent a 
21% increase in DPH.

The other three?  Reduced cast time is nice, it broke some
spells, but the fix was appropriate, if too encompassing.

The choker?  Well, the chance to save a malachite on summoning
a pet is ok.  If/when I'm a CoTH whore on a raid, the savings
in pearls will definitely be worth it.  They had to/have to fix
the exploit with the enchant metal lines though.

The Mantle is nearly useless to me right now.  When I get
improved invis at 54 it will be a bit more useful, as that
is one of the only buffs that activates it for me.  I still
wear it, because it is almost the same mana boost as my
2nd coldain shawl, and 20 more hp and better AC.

As for the complaint that items this nice shouldn't be 
summoned, I'd say just wait 'til you see what drops.  History
tells us that mage summoned items are nowhere near as
desireable as regular items a similarly leveled person can
get.  I'm guessing the focus effects won't be much better,
but the stats will be.
