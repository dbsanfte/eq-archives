Again, bullshit.  I don't care what your original post was to the thread,
since three posts after it you put up this little gem.  (the one I responded
to, and even quoted)

Anyhow, we cleared ToV north last night, I think that pretty much
establishes our position in the hierarchy of guilds, both on E'Ci, and
server-wide, as while we were in there, Dain, Sont and Kland were
dinging all over Norrath as they stubbornly refused lay down for anyone
else ):oP

Got it?  Good, now read the second line you wrote.  Particualrly the one
saying "I think that pretty much estabishes our position in the heirarchy of
guilds, both on E'ci, and server-wide"

Now, how was *I* the first person to mention E'ci?

You're the one that tried to make an issue of it, not me.
