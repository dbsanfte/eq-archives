Are macros limited to two commands?   Or has a patch limited them?  Or
am I doing something wrong?  There are five lines available, but when I
try:

/pause 90, /doability 5
/pause 90, /doability 5
/pause 90, /doability 5
/pause 90, /doability 5
/doability 5

It only performs twice and then stops.  Ability 5 is Begging;  I've
also tried it with Fishing.  Same result.  Executes two lines then it's
done.

Apologies if this has been answered somewhere, but I've tried every
search string I could think of and couldn't find anything relevant
using "Everquest" "macros" "limited", etc.
