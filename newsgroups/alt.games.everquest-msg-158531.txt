He isn't in the library, he's out in the other area.  Well I say 'he' but I
suspect there are three, one for good, one for evil, and one for nuetral.  At
any rate, I found High Priest something or other using my bard alt as a
tracker, and sure enough, he was either the guy, or one of the guys.  Hmm, I
thought I had the loc here but I don't see it.

For every class, you are looking for someone with your class's level 60 title
in front of his name.  Note that the spell vendors for clerics, for example,
are mere Vicars.  Bah.
