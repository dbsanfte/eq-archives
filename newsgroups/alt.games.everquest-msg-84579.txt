Hmm, I had a similar problem being that after the name & password, Everquest
tries to connect via a different file. Zonealarm kicks in and pops up a
screen to ask if you want it to connect. Everquest sees something pop up,
overwrites it and totally blocks.

Switching zonealarm off before playing (if you crashed to desktop then tried
again RAM seemed to be messed up and things would go nasty).

I now have the registered version (trail of 30 days first). This one can add
a file directly and be tagged as "changing" so once added it will always be
let through.
