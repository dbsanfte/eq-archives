With the kiting method, I can kill a red to me harrier in under a minute, med
for a couple, and repeat.  Yes, I suppose I could root/DOT the mob to
death instead, but since I have only one DOT (stinging swarm) it would take
forever...yes, I'd bet FM when done, but I bet the whole affair would take
ten minutes.  Too, while snare usually sticks (and I can certainly run far
enough ahead for a second or third try if needed) root, I find, does not,
in fact I'm having trouble sticking root to blue rooks, darters and egrets.

If I'm going to DOT, its in combination with porcupine; slap a couple nukes
on while kiting the mob over to a safe area, then put my DS up, then
DOT the mob who will come to a grinding "take the full DOT damage" halt
when he gets to me and starts hurting himself.  Mobs that don't hit hard,
I actually find this to be the most efficient method; I can treeform up
after the fight and regen the lost HP at the same time (and nearly the
same rate) as my mana, so I'm getting double the effect out of my med
time.

Knowing Verant, and their penchant for training us to do everything wrong,
this will doubtless change as I level up.  More than one DOT, for example,
and stickier roots, might make the Sit method more productive...
