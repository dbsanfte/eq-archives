Hemmm We allways gets WAY too much leather crap, and that is the same in
Time too, the last trail we had got Leather BP on her first Time raid (and
first raid with us) it was eather that or rot, so I feal there drops way too
much leather in EP and Time with only 3 classes using it. But plate is not
that common and that is proberly the armor type where there is most useres.
