My dwarf does this:

BardNPC says, 'Greetings! I am from the League of Anatonican Bards,
  blah blah blah, are you [interested] in delivering [mail] for us?'
I say, 'I am interested in eating your mail.'
BardNPC says, 'Great! Blah blah I have one that -- well, I have one
  that needs to go to Kelethin right now. Will you [deliver] this mail
  to [Kelethin] for me?'
I say, 'I will deliver a big kiss to Kelethin after I eat your mail.'
BardNPC says, 'Thank you! Deliver this note to Jakum Webdancer in the
  Bard's Guild... blah blah woof woof'

Gotta amuse myself somehow.  And you usually get a chuckle out of
anybody in the vicinity when you do this, so it's worth it.  I figure
it's better than just throwing out the keywords with the appropriate
prefix ("what", "I will", etc...)
