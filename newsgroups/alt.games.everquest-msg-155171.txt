DL doesn't green out until the mid-50s.  You're probably
thinking of OT, which would (mostly) be getting light blue
to low blue.  Level 39 is the typical time to start in DL,
especially for clerics since they've just gotten CHeal.

Very true.  The only real pick-up group zones in that list in
my experience are Great Divide, DSP and SolB (but not that
many groups most of the time), and DL, of course, at least
on the server on which my characters play.

It's a good idea to '/LFG on' and sit in Nexus.  Then just
try "/who all 40 50 LFG" and see where there are people in
that range LFG.  That should give you a fairly good idea
where to travel, and you can always send them a tell and
form the group while you're traveling.  The one best thing
about being a cleric is that you'll find it easy to start
groups instead of joining them.  And, if you're smart and
include a porter early, you can go grab people from other
zones and hunt in out of the way places easily too.
