Im sorry your jealous.

If my rogue was so uber, why did James fill a whole page with upgrade ideas?
Devon did too.

I didn't even know the names of most of the armour mentioned (PoP stuff)..
my monk doesn't have a single piece of loot from PoP.

My main is at a different stage of the game to the kind of upgrades I need
to hunt for my rogue.

As a monk my thoughts were HP HP HP HP HP.. ATK AC.. that meant HP/STA above
anything else.   I somehow doubt rogues have the same focus or requirements,
don't you?

The weapons are different.. im still not sure what makes horn such a good
offhand weapon.. or epic mainhand with such a crappy ratio (altho the 15dmg
for extra BS's  has a lot to do with it im sure)..  fastes weap in mainhand
was what my monk did - now that doesnt necessarily hold true

Bracer of fortitude and chitin versus BoB..  I don't know which is the best
of them for a rogue...

The fungi doesn't even belong to my rogue, its my monks.  So thats another
item thats a "must" to upgrade

Give me 2 items and I'll tell you what Id wear as a monk in an instant, and
why... I can't do the same for a rogue, because well.. im not a rogue.

And 1 final thing, if I wanted to dick wave i'd list my monks gear, he has
many endgame loots.  My rogue has NONE.   Thanks for your input, its just a
shame not a single piece was accurate

So in short, fuck you.

Btw my rogue has never even BEEN in a pickup group, thx
