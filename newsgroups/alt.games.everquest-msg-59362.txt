If all you want to do is check the merchants in Thurgadin, you can do
that now.  take the raft from N.ro, you will zone into IC, move to a
desert island.  Run straight across from where the raft drops you.  You
will come to a dock, wait for the boat, when you get off the boat at the
dock on the "main land" bind yourself, cast sow, levitate and superior
camo.  Follow the shore line, and when you can see the next island cross
to it, follow the ice floes along it's edge.  Stick to the shore and
eventually you will see the bridge to E.W.  When i did this around 19 or
so to help with some item transfers, I bound myself on the bridge after
zoning in.  Refresh your sow lev and invis.  again follow the shore line
til you get to the zone edge, then head inland until you get to the zone
"canyon" to GD.  after zoning you may need to refresh your spells,  the
important one at this point is your invis.  Basically you will run
through the canyon your in, until you come to a river, there will be one
narrow "pass" area you will come to first, keep going straight, til you
see the river, turn right and follow the river to the waterfall, which
hides the entrance to Thurgadin.  You can then port back, after
finishing business in Thurg.  You might be able to find a group to do
Tizmaks at 27, they should be blue to red to you i believe at 27.  

If you like a little excitement in your life, after binding on the
bridge, refresh everything but your levitate, and jump off the middle of
the bridge making sure you will hit the water where you jump.  You will
take no damage from the fall, but it makes for some nice hang time.  You
can also do it without your invis on, and get some cool screen shots.
