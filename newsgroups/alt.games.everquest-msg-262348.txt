The difference being, I gave all the information necessary to find the
actual statistics, whereas you simply disagreed out of obstinance and an
obvious lack of knowledge.

I can spell it out for you, in spite of all this information being widely
available for any who care to look for it.

Carter's first year in office saw a more than 350% increase in the deficit,
the second largest increase percentage ever.  Ford's first year in office,
the year after the democrat-controlled congress passage of the Congressional
Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (which removed a president's
ability to impound funds to avoid deficit spending, and wasn't tempered
until passage of the line item veto), the deficit increased more than 850%.

In other words, exactly what I said above, spelled out for the simpleminded
who are too lazy and/or stupid to do anymore than argue without knowledge or
factual basis about that which they know nothing.
