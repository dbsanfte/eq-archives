Before starting EQ, try hitting Ctrl-Alt-Del to bring up the
Task Manager.  From there, shut down *all* tasks except for
Explorer (that's the Windows user interface) and Systray
(that controls the GUI for the little icons down by your
date/time display).  Then run EQ and see if your mouse
response has improved.

Many oddball performance problems in Windows are caused
by the unexpected interactions between an already running
task and whatever application you have in the foreground
(like EQ).
