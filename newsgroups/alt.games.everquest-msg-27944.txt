I'd be surprised if the Ghoulbane can even keep the 500p
price up for long.  Everyone and his 40+ brother is doing the
quest in order to make money selling the Ghoulbane.  I spent
a full day in WK wiping out the Ogre camp, and it seemed that
every 10 minutes a new person was /ooc'ing, "Where do I find
Ryshon Huntsi?"  <- One of the Ghoulbane quest NPC's.

With so many people doing the quest, and with mid-level
Paladins as the only buyers, the oversupply should crash
the average selling price, and is already in the process of
doing so.

I traded my (spare) Ghoulbane for a Glowing Velium Axe,
figuring that the GVA will keep its value better -- it's
cooler looking, not flooding the market, and can be
bought and used by more classes.
