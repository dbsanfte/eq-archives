That wouldn't be an upgrade.

ME is the last version of windows based on the 95/98
codebase. It's the end of the line so to speak. 2000
on the other hand is an evolution of NT. The soon to
be released WinXP is based on the NT family as well.
ME is the last stop on a dead end.

If your hardware has good Win2k drivers it's the
"best" Windows you can get right now IMO.
