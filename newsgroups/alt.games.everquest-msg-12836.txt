Dead right.  People yell "Rogues suck" when I"m LFG - but they don't realize
some of the fun of it.  Don't let people tell you anything about a class'
fun-level until you've tried it yourself.  They don't know your likes and
dislikes.
At 26, I was sneak-hiding through EW.  I'm keeping an eye out for Giants who
I knew could not see me.  I hear another one approaching and I don't worry,
I'm safe.  I near the crest of a hill from the top side when suddenly a
Shardwurm Broodmother is right on top of me.  No combat happended, no rogues
pulped, but the spontaneous exhilaration I felt when I realized that I was
pulling a fast one on a 50+ mob was intense.

Then there was the time I snuck, at 25, to the depths of MM to get Blood
Spirits....
