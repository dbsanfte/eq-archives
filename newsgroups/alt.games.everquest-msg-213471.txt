You were killing the wrong giants.  It takes considerably longer to up
your CoV faction by killing frost giants than it does killing storm
giants.  Go into Kael to find the storm giants and kill those instead.
 The faction boost to CoV is considerably larger, although you won't
gain any dwarf faction by doing that.
