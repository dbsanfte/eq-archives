From the shadows, the mysterious "Archerbear"

Seriously, at your level, who cares whether or not you're tanking. You
have no cleric and wouldn't be chealing even if you did because none
of you has much in the way of hp yet. You probably have an AC very
near the tank's unless he was at a higher level of twinkage than you,
and someone using a wurmy doesn't normally fall into that category.
This isn't PoP 50+. Rangers can tank that crap in SF especially with
two slowers.

I'd be snaring the mob when it got close to the group and MTing the
entire time. The aggro screwing around was probably way more of a
problem than having the ranger just suck it up (I bet the rogue agrees
with me too).
