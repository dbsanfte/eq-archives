A misunderstanding? Here is my original statement that started this
conversation...

"Heh... so in other words, you dealt 22.78 DPS -with- Shaman buffs, Yaulp 5
(25% Hasted added), and Celerity (50% Haste)? With a grand total of 75%
Haste, that's impressive for a Cleric, but nothing for a Paladin. It looks
like Cleric melee really isn't as powerful as everyone believes it to be...
just flashy. :b

As for Haste increasing proc-rate, it does... but indirectly. Haste
increases your amount of attacks, which increases the chance to proc more
per fight. Makes sense?"

Looking back, I could have been more specific - however I figured that since
I was talking about his melee, the reader would see that I wasn't talking
about melee across the board.

Yeah, but you see, you're giving people too much credit. The average person
doesn't research things, and they only look at the bottom line. It's
comparable to reading only the first and last pages of a book.

You'll find that those that can be manipulated are the majority, as such,
they have more sway than those that are too intelligent to be lead.
