Ah, ok, definitely butting heads there <rub>.

I believe some (?) US cable internet providors do not lease you a modem, but in
Canada, all cable modems are leased, and if I remember the general @home policy
document, all US @home ones are leased as well.

Well, I did install it for him too, and 20 minutes at 60 bucks an hour comes to
20 bucks, so I gave him 10 to take it off my hands :)

Whether installing a pots modem for someone is actually worth 20, well, the
customer is always right (wish Verant remembered that adage).
