Free clue:  that's not a generalization.  It's an observation.
I didn't apply it to everyone, just to people I've observed
making the comment, people who were uniformly in either the
KS groups and/or had sufficient DKP to get pretty much any
drop they wanted.

Nonsense.  No guild raids for anything else.  Maybe YOU won't
get XP or YOU won't get loot, but some in the guild are.  Otherwise
it's a waste of time for the guild.  I've certainly spent enough
hours in ToV farming armor drops to know better.
