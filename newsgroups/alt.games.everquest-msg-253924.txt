We have a ready-made group in the low 30's.  We are not uber twinked
but have better than 30's gear, likely low to mid 40's.

Group consists of Warrior, shaman, enchanter (2), cleric/paladin
(rotate), druid, and bard.  Not all show every week but we usually
have 4+ with warrior and cleric/pally always on.

What's good hunting for this level?  Not looking for class specific
zones but rather alot of fun.  Death, destruction, and general mayhem.
Loot is nice but items are less of a concern for reasons above.  Plat
type loot is preferred, but not over mayhem.

I've looked at eqatlas' level listings but it's not a good indicator
of fun, just here's where you are less likely to wipe type of thing.

Thanks.
