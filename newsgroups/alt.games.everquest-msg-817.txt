im allso a LvL34 druid and I find that the only way to go is to group, the
Con's are all set diffrent then anyother area outside SoV, I have fought
blues now that were blue when I was LvL30 and I still have trouble solo'n
them, so far tizmaks are easy in the great devide.

    get in a group and fight Kodiaks there great exp now and will hopefully
get better after wensdays patch.

    Mallaien LvL34 druid The Rathe

My level 35 shaman has no problem killing the drakkel dire wolf in great
divide, they give great XP
for a soloist. :)
