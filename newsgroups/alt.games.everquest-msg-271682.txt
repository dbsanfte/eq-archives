I'm not all that impressed with EQ2 graphically, actually.  Even turning
everything all the way up, it doesn't look anywhere near as good as those
movies SOE was showing about a year ago at trade shows.  I think a lot of
EQ2's reputation as being the best MMORPG graphically comes from people
remembering those movies, and assuming that the game looks like that.

It's really hard to compare EQ2 and WoW graphically because they use
different styles.  EQ2 is going for a more realistic look, where is WoW is
going for a cartoonish style.  (And of the games that are going for a
realistic look, I'm not sure EQ2 is the best...there was a graphics update
to DAoC with the Catacombs exansion that looks pretty awesome, especially
some of the environmental effects).

Yes, this is very nice of Blizzard.  It is very cool to be able to play WoW
on my desktop PC, or to decide I feel like relaxing in the living room and
play on my PowerBook connected to my 61" DLP TV.  They beat out SOE's
half-assed EQ1 Mac support in three ways:

1. The Windows and Mac releases were simultaneous.

2. They are in the same box.  EQ1 Mac was a separate purchase.

3. They use the same servers.  In EQ1, the Mac players could not play on the
same servers as the Windows players, and vice versa.  So, no playing with
your Windows-using friends.
