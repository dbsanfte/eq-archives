No, I know Druids are better at soloing than just about everyone. I'm
just saying the gap isn't as insanely massive as folks are suggesting.
By the way, James: 15-20 minutes to med back from 0 mana. Sure, still
faster total than the ranger, but not by anywhere near as much as the
original numbers suggested.
