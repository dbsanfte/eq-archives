The bottom line here is what you enjoy playing ... yes this is a game.
Absorbing as you get into it and a good opportunity to increase your circle
of friends.

I play a high lvl Wiz as my main and enjoy him thoroughly ... this is after
a shedload of deaths as I learned the skills to survive.  You will find that
whatever class you play will eventually pall and you will yearn for other
classes to grow and seek the challenge of new things.

Stick with your funny footed little druid for a while.  I do not like druids
either as they are the easiest class to play (that is me).  That said high
lvl druids in raids have saved my bacon as secondary healers more than once
and their DD at the top lvls is not too bad.

Pick one of your classes and just go for it ... each has a place in the high
lvl game, some just not as prominent as others.

Enjoy the diversity of the classes for what they are.

Rant off ... have fun o)
