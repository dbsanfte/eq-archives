Well it is test and as such not as populated with players. There has been a
big increase but mostly with players wanting to be MPCs. While it is fun and
a nice diversion from regular EQ play there is way to many possibilities for
abuse. Trying to level a Druid in Crushbone is a pain now. The orc MPCs
train the Emperor to the zone line every few minutes and he sees invis so
you have to zone. =(

Orc MPCs in GFay camping the newbie area also.

There have been several massacres from it though. Wanting to play a monster
is fine but you die trying to train regular players with no fear of
reprisal. Starting to look like there will need to be some major changes if
this is going to be implemented.
