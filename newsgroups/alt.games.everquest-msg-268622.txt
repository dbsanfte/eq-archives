Well, they had free transfers from Runnyeye to Faydark to help with
the Runnyeye overpopulation, so you could try there.  Antonia Bayle
probably also has a lot of UK (or rather European, which translates to
similar playtimes as UK) players, but that is probably just as full as
Runnyeye is.

You can still create a character on Runnyeye, or should be able to,
anyway, they've said there are no hard limits on server population.
