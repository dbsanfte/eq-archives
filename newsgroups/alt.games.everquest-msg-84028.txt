He's not talking about hotkeys.  It is possible to remap keys to have
different functions, for instance, making 'a' not be your attack key
anymore.  This is a global, for all characters on that computer, mapping,
not customized for each character.  My guess would be that what he wants to
do is possible, but I have never change my keymapping, so I don't know.
