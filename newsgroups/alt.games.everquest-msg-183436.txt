I was at a camp the other day, getting "ok" experience.  A guild-mate of 
mine was there playing his Ranger and I sent him a tell that he needs to 
log his druid some time and he and I can try charm-killing at this camp.

Most of the group left, so I got a guild Wiz and Pally to come over and the 
Pally grabbed a cleric and warrior.  We did ok; I was still getting 
positive EXP and ok loot.  During the downtime ( Cleric with KEI was OOM a 
lot, too ), I would have the druid snare a mob and then I'd charm and haste 
it and let it beat the crap out of another mob.  Pally had to leave not 
much later, and then the cleric and warrior had to bug out, leaving me and 
the Wiz.  He said he had a druid bud who may want to join and the guy came 
over.

Druid snares, I tash and charm.  Druid snares, I tash, he charms.  I haste 
both while Druid pulls a 3rd and we let the pets demolish the bob, Wizzie 
nuking here and there.  I EASILY made 4-5 times the EXP per hour with the 3 
of us than I was making with the full group.  I'm quite stoked to go back 
with the same group makeup or maybe with 2 druids.

I am also tired of normal groups.  I really enjoyed a trio I had at one of 
the Coterie outposts - Me, a Wizzie, and a Necro aggro kiting.  Later, 
another Necro joined us.  Some of the mobs we pulled between Coterie pops 
were Skeletons, so we would have 5 skelly skins going at once, which can be 
a little confusing at time, but still pretty fun.

I went to this camp with my 2 friends to get these:

Shrouded Boots
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  
Slot: FEET  
AC: 12
STR: +4  DEX: +4  STA: +4  CHA: +5  WIS: +4  INT: +4  AGI: +4  
WT:  2.5    Size: SMALL
Class: ALL
Race: ALL

We were about to quit for the night, when we decided to pull 2 more from 
the other camp before we logged.  The second one dropped them.  BOOYA!  
Buh-bye Kobold boots.
