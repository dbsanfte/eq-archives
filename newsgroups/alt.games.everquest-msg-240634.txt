is a familiar different than a pet?

ok, just like dnd, stay in character as much as possible. use the emote 
table (socials?) as much as possible.

btw, does "/say bar" show up as "foo says bar out of character" or just 
"foo says bar"? if so, how do you say stuff not in the emote table that 
is "in character"?

and mine should be like the one i usually play in dnd.

off to play now :)

thanks for your assistance.
