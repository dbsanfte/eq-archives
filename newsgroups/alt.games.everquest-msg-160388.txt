This is William from Meetup.com.

We have received requests from many Everquest fans suggesting we create
an International Everquest Meetup Day, a chance for Everquest fans
worldwide to meet each other locally.

We listened and have scheduled International Everquest Meetup Day
for Thursday, November 21st (the 3rd Thursday of every month). See the
details here: http://everquest.meetup.com/

A quick summary of Meetup.  Meetup creates real-world group gatherings
about anything anywhere. We've built a technology and a network of
venues (cafes, bars, etc.) that can help any interest group easily
organize local monthly meetups in over 530 cities across 27 countries.

Please let me know of any questions or comments.  Thanks,

-william
