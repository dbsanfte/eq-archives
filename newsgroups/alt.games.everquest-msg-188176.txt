It's a bug that a revenant is up there.  Wait until the next time
the server goes down/up and it should be gone.

The visual glitch georg is talking about is a rock golem that pops
through the wall on occasion next to the ledge on the water.  He
won't aggro, just ignore him.

There are only 11 mobs before the locked door into the castle

the 6 entry warriors
a roaming crusader that goes from the rock in front of the
bridge to the hallway behind the entrance.
a warrior/crusader pair just past the entrance of the
hallway past the entrance (on either side, so you can't
target them without an eye or without aggroing them)
and a crusader/rock golem pair on the bridge to the castle.

You don't run into revenants until you drop off, enter the
castle, goto the castle basement and to the city of the dead.

If you're interested in checking out the zone, make a level
1 halfling rogue worshipping brell, take him over there.  Drop
off the left side.  He's non-Kos to everything but the ghosts
and rats, which he can sneak hide past.
