It's true that you can do this.  It's also true that you don't have to.  If
you are disappointed in the speed at which you are leveling, then you can
and should find a better way to level, of which there are many.  OTOH:  one
does not have to have "leveling" as their goal in the game.  This may even
make the player less "clueless" than the player who applies all the tricks
to level.  Perhaps on chooses a path that makes it more difficult, as part
of their game experience.  They have a MORE defined role for their player
than the person who's just trying to "beat the game".

Cheers,
Eric
