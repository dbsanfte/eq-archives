Unless you are playing on the Firiona Vie server, you normally talk
in Common; a language everyone in the world can speak and understand 
perfectly.

If you want to speak another language, the command is something like

/lang 4

Now everything you say in /say, /groupsay, /tell, /guildsay, /ooc, 
/shout, and I think the various chat channels will all be in that language.

If you don't speak that language very well, then it will be garbled so 
nobody will ever read it perfectly (but depending on your actual skill 
and their ability to puzzle things out, might be able to work out what 
you mean.)

Similarly, if they don't speak that language well, they might not 
understand you even if you are flawless at it.

To see which languages you know (even one point of skill will do), do a

/lang help

This will list all the languages you know, and tell you what their 
number is so you can use the /lang # command to switch to them

I think Common is /lang 1 for everyone, so using that to switch back to 
the universal tongue always works.

Few people bother to learn other languages, and they are of little 
practical use in most situations, although it -can- be amusing to 
chatter away, say gnome to gnome in a party of big people for instance.

On the Firiona Vie server, there -is- no "common", and you'll have great 
  difficulty communicating with anyone other than members of your own 
race at first.  Few people ever learn the more obscure languages like 
Gnome, so you'll need to learn Elvish at a minimum, and Dark Elvish will 
also help a lot.  Oddly Human, which has the advantage of a shorter 
predicate, is rarely spoken.  Even here, on a "role play" server with no 
official common language, few bother learning more than the minimum; 
you'll see everyone from trolls to Iksar to Vah Shir all speaking 
blithely in Elvish... because if they don't, half the people in their 
group, guild, or zone (depending on which sort of chat they are using) 
won't be able to understand them.

I'd think that on the Zek (pvp) servers you might actually get some use 
out of the more obscure languages in terms of ability to communicate 
secretly in zone wide open formats... but then all it would take would 
be a few people on the "other side" who are willing to put in the couple 
hours work to teach themselves Dark Speech or whatever to break your "code"

Grage, 57 Barbarian Berserker who's never learned one new language (Luclin)
Splendid One, 65 gnome mage with half the languages in the game at 100 (FV)
Bergh Brelltender, 65 cleric, every language in the game at 100 (Morell 
Thule, so no reason for it at all)
