There was a nerf of sorts on this. Pets, like NPC's/Mobs could proc any
weapon no matter what the level, they changed this so that the pet has to be
the appropriate player level to proc a weapon (NPC's/Mobs and LD players,
still, do not) I think I still have 2 in the bank so I may give this a  try
tonight.
