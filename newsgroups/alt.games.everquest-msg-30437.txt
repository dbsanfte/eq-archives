Which character do you have your trade skills on? Reason I ask is because
the other night I did some skill advancement checks vs wis vs pp in
fletching. Very preliminary, but it looks like at least 2,000 pp to get to
200 fletching with 80 wisdom. If I had it all to do over, would have made an
enchanter mule with int and charisma up the kazoo for everything vs
character appropriate skills.

Personally I regard something like an Gnome Enchanter being a better for
fletching then *any* ranger as kind of a retarded design. Just happens to be
the system we work under. An Erudin enc would be slightly better since the
bow wouldn't be taller then they are if they could equip it.
