I feel Sonys policy with regards to this issue is nothing more than an
attempt to maximize CD sales.  If I buy a game why can't I sell it?  People
do it all the time with playstaion/xbox/etc... and there are even stores
that speciallize in used games or rental games.  Certainly the programer/s
own the code (intellectual property) but the consumer who buys the game owns
that copy of the game...  the Co. selling it is offering a copy for sale and
in Sonys case it is for sale and not rental etc...  I feel whoever pays the
monthly fee for a set period, say 2,3,4,5 or even 6 months should be viewed
as the games owner and not the original purchaser.  CD keys have always been
nothing more than a form of copy protection geared totally towards the Co's
advantage with little or no concern about the consumer.  When I quit EQ
you'd better believe I'll sell both my accounts if my wife or a friend
dosn't want them and cheep too.
