Playing around in GD the other day killing Coldain Tracking Wolves, I
dropped my Coldain faction down a bit, but raised my faction with at
least the frosties in the
zone up to Glares, which I find means I can scoot past giants and
Drakkal wolves
as long as I don't linger.

This got me thinking, can I get both up to non KOS at the same time?  I
think this is impossible thru killing, as everything I kill that boosts
faction on one side lowers it on the other, and I hear that the negative
hits are larger than the positive ones.

But if there are any quests I can do, for example, that raise faction
only with
one side or the other?  OR perhaps I could go kill in Skyshrine, does
that raise
or lower faction with giants and/or dwarves?

I do intend to go kill in Skyshrine, just as I'm enjoying killing those
creepy looking coldain, because my main character made the choice to get
on the good side of both these factions, so there are zones I've been
unable to really enjoy.
