I could be wrong here, so bear with me.  I'm still somewhat of a newbie...

The total maximum cap on intelligence is 255, yes.  But the soft cap is 200.
After 200 points, you get a far less significant amount of mana for each
point of INT than for each point before 200.  So losing those 21 points of
INT while gaining 170 points of mana probably benefited you even in mana,
and even if not, you probably didn't lose too much.  And I'm sure the added
benefits more than make up that difference.

Again, could be wrong, but that's what I think I've been hearing on the
subject.
