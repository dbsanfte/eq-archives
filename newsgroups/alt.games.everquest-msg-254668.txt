Eastern Wastes has loads of them, if I recall correctly.  I was there
a fair while back, and there is a spot where they just amble around,
and I recall seeing around 10 or 12 at any one time.  Didn't bother to
kill any or even con them, as a pal and I were just passing through,
and he showed me the spot out because it was unusual to see so many
mammoth in one spot.  Whether they drop tusks like the mammoth in
Everfrost, I couldn't say...

I think lvl 31 is a bit light for the zone, as there are some tough
mobs in there - you almost certainly know that anyway - and the zone
line can be a long haul!  Might be worth a look though.
