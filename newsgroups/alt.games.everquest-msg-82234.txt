Slightly OT, but is there a switch for the prison room in Sol A. that opens 
the door?  I was down there and the Wizard in the cell aggroed me and came 
out.  I ended up in the cell when the door closed.  -How- embarassing.

My guildies got pictures of me behind bars and had a great laugh, and I got 
out by pushing forward / ducking / jumping, but there must be a switch 
somewhere.  I figured it was in the Torturer's room, but didn't look after 
I got out.  Too busy trying to find and kill Inferno Wizards.
