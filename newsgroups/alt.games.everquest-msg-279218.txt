That's actually not necessarily true. I am not /anon, but at the same 
time I don't have the slightest inclination to respond to /ooc or 
/aution begs, and will actively ignore /shout-ers.

I'm not against buffing someone though. And if someone sends me a tell 
and I'm not really too busy I'll usually agree to buff.

I guess it boils down to /ooc etc doesn't expect or demand a response so 
i ignore it. Once I've been singled out with a tell, though, a response 
is more expected... he's asking *me* ... and unless I'm actually too 
busy I'll probably respond favourably.

Treble the odds of me being willing if they actually took the time to 
actually find me first.

I find many people share this trait, and use it to my advantage to get 
buffs, find groups, and all sorts of things.

It applies in real life too.
