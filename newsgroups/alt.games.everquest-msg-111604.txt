Hello again.I'll try winproxy.Thanks for info
As to the ping on sattlelite it's not bad once you get used to it only place
I'v had trouble was in DL when there were 96 other peeps in zone.
The server I use is Direct PC and I know it's sattlelite cause I don't even
have a phone liner were I live ROFL.
I had to buy a cell phone that I could hook to a PC cause to set up a
sattlelite account you have to dail into there server one time so they can
confirm your account.I thought this was stupid but hell I got internet now
hehehe.
Price per month is 69.95 and like 199.00 for hook up but they run specials
all the time so check net for price
The only thing I can see bad about sattlelite is it is a USB connection to
PC
Oh ya I'm in washington state so from here the dish pionts 27 degrees off
ground,if your in midwest you would be pionting straight up from what i was
told.I don't know if this makes any diffrence on send recive time but it
should.
Just to let you know I play a necro on Stormhammer server and do just fine.I
also play a warrior on karana server and can pulll most of the time so pings
not to bad heheeh.
