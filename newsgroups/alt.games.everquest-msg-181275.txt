I was hunting in FoB with my Iksar SK when a large scorpion popped close 
by. I immediately ran over and popped it one, since I was still getting xp 
from the large ones. As I backed to a safe spot to fight it, I conned 
it...green...crap. I was expecting a short wasted of time while I 
dispatched it when I saw:

"You have gotten better at Defense (40)"

I thought, "Huh. Well, wasn't a total loss then." Can you then believe my 
surprise when a few swings later I saw:

"You have become better at 2H Slashing (43)" 
...followed on the very next swing by
"You have become better at 2H Slashing (44)"

I blinked a time or two and conned it again just to be sure. Yep. Green as 
could be. It is obviously *possible* to get skill-ups from a green (I just 
told you about it happening to me), my question is, is it possible to get 
them from just *any* green mob or does it have to be a sliver below light 
blue?
