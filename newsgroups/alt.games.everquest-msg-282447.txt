Hm, from my one brief look at the new UI, my recollection is that
the new hotbars 3-4 are indeed vertical, but they're a single column
of 10 buttons.  As I said, I do prefer to have the buttons in a clump
in the corner, rather than running along the edge of the screen, even
if that edge is a vertical edge.  It's a matter of area: with the old
UI, I have my hotbar next to my spell bar, and if I look in the general
area of that corner of my screen I can see what any of the hotkeys and
spell gems are.  If the hotbar runs vertically for a full 10 buttons,
that forces me to look up and down the bar sometimes to remind myself
which hotkeys are active.

Sigh, it does sound as though I'm going to have to dive into the custom
UI game, which is something I'd managed to avoid till now.  I assume
it's possible to copy the old 2x5 hotbars in a way similar to your
instructions for copying gem and buff icons?  Guess I'll go have a look
at the eqinterface site and see what I can learn.

I don't have DoD yet (got burned with DoN, which I still haven't used
much other than than guild lobby/hall), so yes, Item XP is not an issue.

The new audio alerts work fine in the old UI (and are a GREAT feature).

Well, ignoring for the moment that I want 2x5 and not 1x10, even in a
vertical hotbar, there's a problem with "start using".  I'm already
using all four hotbars!  That was another wonderful feature they added
recently: instead of having to switch between hotbars to get at buttons
other than my "standard" ten, I can have 40 hotkeys available at all
times.  (I still have some alternate hotkey banks, usually for variations
on the 40 standard buttons.  E.g., when wielding a two-handed weapon, I
switch to a hotbank where my "bash" hotkey is replaced by a "ghetto bash"
hotkey that uses the bandolier to switch to a shield, bash, switch back.)

So no, I can't just switch my keys to have the number keys use bar 3.
I need to be able to have 4 hotbanks available at the same time, and
hopefully keep them in the 2x5 layout.  Like I said, I expect I can
find out how to do this from reading the interface website.

Thanks for the starter tips, I'll see what I can do to take it from
there.

p.s.: I still don't understand why SOE felt the need to change the UI
so much in the first place.  Presumably they could've added the new
features into the existing UI instead.  What's so wonderful about the
new UI, anyway?  (Is there any truth to the rumor that all it really
does it make EQ look more like some other game, such as WoW or EQ2?)
