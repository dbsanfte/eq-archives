This is the kind of preference decision that you will
ultimately have to solve for yourself.

The low 50s is a real testing point for characters who have
trouble finding groups. These levels are considerably harder
than the levels before (as you know), yet the characters
often don't have many new abilities to offer groups.

Personally, I've found that starting over in EQ can be a
really invigorating experience. I imagine it would
especially so on a new server where you don't know anyone
and can't really twink. If you're looking for a class
similar to the Ranger, I would say Bard is the closest class
that will find groups easier to come by. If you want to try
something different, go with Cleric, Enchanter, or Shaman.
If you want to focus on soloing ability instead of group
desirability, maybe Necro.
