The same way a private citizen dressed in a policeman costume and driving a
used police car he bought at auction can threaten motorists he thinks are
speeding.  (Actually happened in a community I lived in...he pulled them
over and issued out "warnings.")

Threatening does not necessarily mean they can carry out that threat.  In
the case of the RL fake policeman, he could threaten to ticket, fine, and
incarcerate people all he wanted, but he had no authority or ability to
really do it.

If some goofball is impersonating a GM, he may not be a threat to anyone's
personal account, but he IS a threat to the stability of the game as a
whole.
