Here's a better way. Buff with SOW (or wolfform), regen (or chloro), skin and
coat.

Find 4 non-caster low-to-medium (low is better if your gear is not so hot)
blues that run exactly the same speed.

Cast a damage shield right before you are ready pull. Pull 3 with ensare
trying to keep them close together. Now stand still and let the closest one
start beating on you and run away as soon as the third joins (with practice
should be able to do this and lose only a couple bubs of health at most. In
fact I would take extra hits to work on defense since regen will have you
almost at full health by the time you're done.). Now find a forth and cast
ensare. Then either run circles around the pack or form a V with you at the
bottom and the three together and one at the ends; slowly ack away keeping
the V angles and soon you will have 4 together. (For some reason only three
mobs will melee you at once--at least for the mobs I've tried this with.)

Now simply run those 4 mobs around casting your level 34 lighting AE spell
until they start to die. You will probably need a DOT spell to finish the
last one off. Can be a little tricky in places like Kunark where MOBS always
"run" even if in a pack. You'll need to DOT them and just run circles around
them while they slowly die. With very good timing you can train the ones
still chasing you into the running ones and hit them all with the same AE
spell.

Now you sit on your behind and med back to full and repeat.
 
Good places I've found to do this are Iceclad, Overthere, SK (usually too
crowded though).
