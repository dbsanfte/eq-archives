    It's all about picking your poison. You can't win no matter what method
you choose.

    People will find a way to be unhappy when they don't get stuff, no
matter what the reason is. All that changes is the specifics of their rants.

    So it's better to create a system that ignores non-raidtime
contributions, the little things that keep a guild moving, instead? Better
hope you can find some suckers to do all the work for no reward, then. And
if you do reward non-raid contributions, you get pointsflation and hoarding,
you get unqualified people demanding to do jobs so they can scoop the
points, you get people faking mini-events to get points.... Like I said
above, pick your poison.

    "What sort of guild are we running here where a paladin can get a BoW
over a warrior?! Don't you losers care about building a strong guild, or is
it all about your Magelo profiles? Paladin - what the hell were you thinking
even ASKING for a BoW when you knew warriors needed them still? Asshole! I
hate you all!"

     Drama knows no bounds. We've picked up a fair number of quality players
recently from the other Quarm guild because of growing hatred for that
guild's points system. In particular, one of our warriors left the other
guild after another warrior asked for, and won, an item that was a 5 HP
upgrade for him. No big boosts to resists, or AC, or any melee foci - it was
5 HPs more than what he had, so he wanted it, and he had the points to get
it. The warrior that got the loot is sitting over 8700 HPs unbuffed, the
warrior that left for us is now at over 7800 unbuffed. Would you say people
leaving your guild qualifies as "drama"? Would you say that allowing total
morons like Mr. 8700 HPs to make loot decisions is good in any way, shape,
or form for the guild?

    I like our system. Points are tracked internally, but only used as a
guideline by officers when awarding loot. So the "faulty memory" problem
just doesn't happen. The officers always have an objective listing of play
time versus rewards obtained to look at when trying to judge who has worked
hardest for the guild.
