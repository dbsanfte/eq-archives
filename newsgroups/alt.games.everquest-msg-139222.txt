Wow awesome.

Finally we got in game maps!

New modification adds map tabs to the actions window
at this site:

http://eqtoolbox.not.net/index.php

1) register. PITA but oh well.

2) Look under Downloads. Then EverQuest New skins (other.)

3) Download UI map and follow the instructions in the readme.txt.

All I can say is: Thanks for the new interface Verant!
And thanks to the EQtoolbox! AWESOME!

Spread the word!

Fuck now I am never going to stop playing this game.
That was one of the last big wishes I wanted for this game.

Now if they fix the pathing and targeting problems I am doomed.
