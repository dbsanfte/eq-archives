A business that sees a customer that cancels out at the slightest
possible setback isn't one they're going to want to retain, since he's
going to be far more trouble than his $15 a month is worth.

He could have complained _before_ canceling.

As if they aren't getting that anyway from anyone who got bored or who
flipped out at the tiniest detail.

And to at least some extent they get that.  Ex-customers who fire off a
parting shot should expect to have it promptly binned.
Especially someone who has quit after less than a week.

Most of those sites tend to get nabbed by the cyber poachers (as soon as
ownership expires) hoping to sell it back to the original owner.
nospam.com used to be owned by a private individual who did not
appreciate getting bombarded by spam due to ignorant 3rd parties using
his domain to munge with.

It's my e-mail address.

Are you seriously suggesting that everyone should hide their address
just because YOU choose to?

Here's a small clue for you, SPAMMERS are the ones at fault.  I'm not
going to cower behind a fake or munged address from spamming scum.

If someone legitimate wants to send me e-mail based from a usenet post I
made, they're welcome to do so.

Hiding from SPAM doesn't reduce the bandwidth wasted by it, and it only
legitimizes the spammers.

Over 90% of all the spam i've ever received has been advertising
American products, usually with a little disclaimer at the bottom,
claiming that they don't support spamming, wouldn't dream of spamming,
but hired a 3rd party bulk mailer that claims only to send to subscribed
addresses so don't blame the product seller if it was a spam.

The only thing that is going to stop it, is the US government making it
illegal to profit from SPAMMING.  Stick it under the RICO laws. 

Then and only then will US businesses stop hiring "bulk e-mailing"
services who bounce the spam through China or Eastern Europe.
