There are.

Warriors, Rogues and Monks got new disciplines, in addition to the ones they
had before.

Warriors got several "taunt" type disciplines for mid and high levels.  Low
stamina use, fast recharge.   Also a discipline at 61 that increases hate
generated from all hits for ~10 seconds, and a "defensive" type discipline
at 65... reduces the melee damage they take but snares them (instead of
reducing damage output like the 55 disc does)

Rogues got a level 61 discipline named "Deadly Precision" 5 mintue reuse
time, "greatly increases your chance to hit" and a level 65 discipline,
Twisted Chance, which "greatly increases your chance to critical hit, dual
wield and double attack"   with a 30 mintue recharge.

(I'm not sure what Monk only disciplines were added.)

All 3 classes got two "healing" type disciplines.   One that is first
available at level 10 and costs almost no stamina.  A small amount of
regeneration, fairly fast recharge.   Second is a higher level version of
the same.   Level 61 or so, much greater stamina use, but returns a decent
amount of regeneration.   Maybe 800 hp or so over one minute.
