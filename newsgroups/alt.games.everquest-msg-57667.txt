Not a rut, just using a naming convention to allow people to see it's the
same person playing all these characters. Of course I started that
convention after I had created Lamanya. It's not that I particularly like
all the varieties on the name Jallarzi, just trying to make it easier for
all my friends to know when I have started a new alt, which happens
frequently. Now they just type "/who all Jall", confident that the result
will almost certainly include me somewhere if I am online.

The same goes for the surname, if you see a "Sallavarian" running around,
chances are it's me. Is it really that unusual? I thought many people use
the same surname, and the first name convention comes from a Japanese friend
of mine when I was on MT.
