Nope. I tested that one once while waiting for the casters to med. Started doing
a /who all on clerics in high ranges. Got an amount that didn't cut off and
displayed the total (less than a dozen.) Did the command with "count" and got a
few more than that. And I doubt three more logged on just in that four or five
seconds between lines of typing, though I suppose it's possible.
