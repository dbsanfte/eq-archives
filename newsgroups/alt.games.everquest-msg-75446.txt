I was very upset when I found out this quest was gone last weekend.  I was
planning on getting my druid's faction up with the quest.  Oddly enough, I was
hunting with my mage last night in Runnyeye and one of the Sporali dropped a
"Bag of bread loaves" that is a lore item, if memory servers right, it is the
same name that the bag Jared Meadowgreen used to give you.  I am not sure if
the graphic was the same, it was been a few months since I ran the bread quest
with another character.  I used to give mine to Innkeeper Morpa (sp) in Ferrot
for Oggok faction (plus Clurg).  I will try sometime this weekend to run my
mage down to Ferrot to see if the quest still works, but if the bread loaves
are only a random drop, then this would be a most time consuming way to run the
quest.  I will repost to this thread next week and let you all know if it
worked.

Later,
John
