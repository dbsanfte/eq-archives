    I've seen the same thing. It's been happening since the game had its
first expansion, though. "Don't you know how to fight in a dungeon like Guk?
Don't you know pathing tricks?" "No, I levelled up GFay - EC - WC - Oasis -
Lake of Ill Omen - Overthere - Dreadlands - Burning Woods - Skyfire".
There's always been a ton of stuff to learn, and corners that could be cut
to get to the top levels of gameplay. That's part of what guilds do - make
sure that someone knows how to deal with a situation, rather than have
everyone know how to overcome a problem.

    Bosses in PoP weren't tuned to require gear from top-end Luclin to beat.
That's the big difference. And as the devs are now finding out, stuff had
big HPs in Luclin because having a long fight that had to be executed
flawlessly WAS the best test of skill. The guilds below us used to complain
about how Emperor was such a long fight, and how one stupid error like a
cleric clicking on someone when picking up a mod would destroy the raid.
That was the point!

    Now shove over, Martin. I need a seat at the EQ Old Timers' Home too.
Want some lemonade? It makes a man bitter!
