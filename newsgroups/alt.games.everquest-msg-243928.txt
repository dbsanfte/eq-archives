You have to talk to a person at the camp where your adventures were.
Every two adventures, you will get new dialogue, and every ten (in the
same camp), you will get an upgrade to the stone.  Just try talking to
the people in each camp who don't have a "function" (recruiter,
merchant, magus), one of them will tell you a little story, and when
you've gotten five stories, you get an upgrade.  Sometimes you get
sent away to some other NPC in another zone, and need to talk to them
for a while.
