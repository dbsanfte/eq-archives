That's why I specified "polite SoW request".

Oh really?

I am a level 60 druid and the recruiting officer and keeper of
priest-class spells in my guild. I get inundated with tells, requests
for help, requests to buy spells, requests to join the guild,
questions about the guild, questions about raids and so on ad nauseum.
My time is almost never my own.

And yet somehow despite all that I manage to sow or soe someone if
they ask nicely. It takes me less than two seconds to target someone
and cast soe. If it bounces I say "sec", mem sow (< 2 secs, hotkeys
are wonderful), and cast it on the person (1 second).

If you can take the time to say NO, and yet will not take a few more
seconds and help out someone who is asking politely, then you are
perpetuating the negative perception associated with druids.

Or, if that's too complicated, how about this:

People think druids are assholes. If you flat-out refuse to spare
between 2 and 10 seconds of your time when someone is asking nicely,
then they're going to keep thinking druids are assholes because you
are BEING an asshole.

I try to compensate for the dr00ds, but I can only do so much.
