Yeah, one of my first sneak/hide deaths earned a /bug report.

Urd wizard was indifferent to me, and I stayed in front of him
while /r to a tell...he DIDN'T have See Invis up, or cast it (or he
would have been scowling)...but after about 4 ticks or so, he
croaked on me and brought the whole room over.  I later found
out from an unnamed developer (*cough* Kendrick *cough*)
that hide was randomly (but often) checked for by mobs against
your skill level.  So your level 14 rogue sneaking to the Assassin
to get a Mask of Deception has a lot higher chance of getting
smacked around than your level 45 guy exp'ing there...
