Level 12 Druid, Grasping Roots (or whatever it's called, can't recall
exactly) was resisted about 30% of the time. Ignite was very consistent
at around 34 DMG to mobs. Ding 13 and Grasping Roots is resisted almost
all the time. Ignite averages 7-9 DMG and to the same mobs as level 12.
Also, bears have always conned Amiable, have never killed any, and today
while medding was attacked by a Black Bear.... They usually walk on by.
Can anyone explain the drastic change? None of my other toons exhibit
any problems just this one, although the others are at much higher
levels.
