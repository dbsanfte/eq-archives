I don't buy that, nor do i buy the people who lie to themselves and
say 'the only reason i still play EQ is the friends'. You can get
social interaction and friends over the net via IRC. At some point the
journey while playing has to be fun, the person wants to advance in
this enviornment, and they have fun playing while they do .

One of the problems most games have is that a change in level is
denoted simply by whether or not you killed X number of mobs for X
amount of experience so that your X level can change by 1. As such,
what has happened is even for a game like Everquest, there is a
massive push to have everyone get that maximum hard-cap level so they
can have their full skill set and to play the latest content. I'd like
to see a game in which there weren't numeric levels and used some type
of ranking system in which you could only go up a rank through the
passing of solo trials after a period of gaining experience through
the killing of mobs or performing quests. Advancement should be
earned, not guaranteed. At the same time I'd like to see it
continually test you over time, and if you say PA'd the char, it would
place the new person at the maximum open rank on your character that
their current knowledge and skills qualify them for. It would try to
actually make the rank or level mean something other than your player
killed X mobs.

Just make the reward worth the risk.
