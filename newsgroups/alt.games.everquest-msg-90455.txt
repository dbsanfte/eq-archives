Well I know Iksar is good  :)

But having such a good time with Iksar monk, dont want Warrior to
intrude.

Was going to do ogre, but am thinking now that troll regen is really
appealing.

Ummm, just checked stats.  Ogre waaay ahead of troll on almost
everything.

So still undecided.  Ogre uber cept that troll has regen.  From my
monk I know that regen is really really nice.

Well maybe it comes down to looks.  My ogre warrior lady sort of cute 
:)
