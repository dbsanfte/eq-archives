Didn't know about the Dex for tailoring, but then haven't done all that much
tailoring.  I always buffed my STR to the max for smithing, my WIS truely
sucks compared to what you two have, 130s I think.  My STR is higher fully
buffed.  I've noticed that my skill ups seem to go in spurts, sometimes I
won't get one for 30 or 40 tries, other times, I'll get 2 or 3 in a row.  If
I'm around when you are tailoring, feel free to bug me for a Dex buff.
