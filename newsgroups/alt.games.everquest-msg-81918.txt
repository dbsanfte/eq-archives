If I recall the series I read had  some appendices inwhich many parts of the
story's history were fleshed out.  In it, it explained that Elrond is
half-elven, and was given a choice to remain immortal and eventually return
to the West, or have a lifespan (albiet one considerably longer than
normal). That is why Arwen's decision is so significant - she chooses a
mortal life.  Of course this is after she has already lived for 2000 years
;)
