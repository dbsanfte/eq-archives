    A lot of the original maps had more than 3 layers,
(maps created in game only have 3 layers, but some on the
net had extra layers for labels and spawn points and so on)
which was causing the client to crash. They patched the client
to stop crashing as soon as they realised, but it still misbehaves
if you have old, >3 layer maps in your maps directory. The
map sites like eqtoolbox rereleased new maps pretty soon
after, but that's why you need to redownload them.
