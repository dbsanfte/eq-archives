I was always in a group when multitasking thought it had to be done that
way. And if your faction isn't high enough all you will get is a Thank You
and they keep the item. Screwed up a Shield of Agsis quest once not sure
after a recent patch if faction isn't high enough they give back the item
saying I don't need this. I assume that would screw up a multiquest also.
