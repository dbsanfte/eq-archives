Note that many of the ideas I have could actually be put in place
in EQ as it stands, perhaps all of them could, in fact.  

Here's another, a minor quibble; items that have a minimum level
to proc should say so when you look at them.  Effects should say
what they are, not "haste" but how much, not "gallenites' minor
destruction" but ID I, so on and so forth.  Forcing us to go to
offline resources to look up what our own spells or items do is
irritating.  If you want to have us research it, put a library in
the game and make us go look it up there!
