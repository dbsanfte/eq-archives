Depends completely on the server, I personally recommend Ayonae Ro, it's a
nice place filled with really nice people, but you will get envious of
people below level 10 with gear it takes a level 60 player to get hehe.

Whatever you do DONT try Sullon Zek until you've been playing the game at
LEAST 6 months and you know where most things are and how to avoid certain
situations, they got rid of the play nice policy which used to protect the
majority of the players from the stupid actions of the few.

This means that running up to a monster, hitting it, and then running around
with several enemies on your tail, then running up to someone fighting
something so that the monsters jump the poor devil whose having a hard
enough time fighting and tear him to shreds. This is known as 'training' and
on your average server it's not allowed and is a punishable offence from a
GM, but on Sullon Zek they got rid of that rule cos it makes the PvP
environment more authentic.

When you buy EverQuest you have a pretty limited set of choices, I'm not
sure exactly what your choices are but if you can order from
Amazon.co.uk/Amazon.com try and find the EverQuest deluxe addition, it has
EverQuest and the 2 addons, as well as a strategy guide (which could have
EASILY been written more accurately by most of the posters in this
newsgroup), a small EQ Statuette of a character (I got an Iksar Necromancer,
he's kinda neat :) ) and a map of the entire game (even tho on my map
Velious is missing *shrug*.

Once you've got it installed you'll need to run the patchers. This leads me
on to your next questions.

> 3. Will I spend the first several hours/days downloading patches?

This all depends on your Internet connection, on my 56k modem it took me 4-5
hours to get all the patches, and that REALLY sucked cos I was excited to
get into the game. If you're on a cable connection I'd expect about 30
minutes to an hour, maybe slightly less or slightly more. If you're on a T1
(which is unusual but not unheard of) then you'll have literally no download
time at all.

I'd advise that you run all of the patchers, they'll all update specific
parts of the game, once this is done press Play Online and then set up your
account. It's all self explanatory so I'll leave you to figure that out.

I've been playing EQ for over a year and a half now, I've seen nearly
everything there is to see in EQ, and with all the constant improvements and
addons the game is still very fresh to me and my 57 Troll Shadow Knight.
Also, this december Verant are releasing a whole new moon to explore,
Luclin, a new playable race, Vah Shir (Kerrans - the Cat People), and a new
class, Beastlord, and this will keep the game fresh for a very very very
long time in my honest opinion.

I definately don't recommend Anarchy Online, I quit it about 3 weeks ago and
from what I gather from friends they've done nothing to improve the game's
stability or remove the bugs, I don't have many high hopes for that game, at
least this year anyway. Maybe 2002 will be an Anarchy filled year, maybe
not, all I know is that AO could have been great but fell way short of my
expectations.

No problem, glad to see some new blood in these old hallowed hallways :)
