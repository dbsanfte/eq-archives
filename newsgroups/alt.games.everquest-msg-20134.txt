GD as well.   If you are on Dwarf / Dragon faction, hunt near the giant fort
in Great Divide.  Frost Giant Bezerkers are excellent experience at this
level, and pretty easy.    Frost Giant Elites are great experience, but much
harder (blue all the way to 59, at least) but can be killed if you have a
higher level group or are good at fear kiting.

Either he killed a load of giants on the way, or he was exadurating.   My
Dwarf started out Apprehensive, just as every other race.

Shawl number 7 is already pretty damn good, to a lot of people.   It has the
effect when worn of Flowing Thought I.   A low level breeze.   And it doesn't
require an Uber Guild to complete it.

Yes.  If you choose to ally with the Giants, sooner or later you're probably
going to want to hunt Dwarves.   Most people in your guild will have to gain
faction to be tolerated in Kael.

Tunare is allied with CoV and the Dwarves.  But really this is probably a
decision where you will perhaps have to go with your guild at the expense of
roleplaying, if your guild plans on doing anything in Velious.   Having a
mixed party where half was KoS to the Giants, and half was KoS to the Dragons
would completely suck.   You wouldn't be able to do anything as a group, with
half the people constantly getting attacked by extra things that should be
neutral or better, and can't really be killed by the main group without
damaging faction.

Good Dragon faction allows for the use of all teleporters, without being eaten
by Wuoshi.    Quite a bit easier to travel, in my (limited) opinion so far.

I love Thurgadin, and have been spending a lot of time there.   It's a full
service town with high level hunting right next door.  And perhaps most
importantly, absolutley no newbie beggars asking for armor or weapons or
platinum or etc, etc, etc.

As would the drakes in Cobalt Scar.
