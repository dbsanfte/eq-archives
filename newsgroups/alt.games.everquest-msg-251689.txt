The lesson to learn from this thread little Timmy, is if you end up
buying platinum.. have the decency to not admit it :>

Does it happen? Ya. Is it 'against the rules'? Sure.. just don't put
the 'KICK ME.. I BOUGHT PLATINUM' sign on your back if you go that
route.

And frankly.. hunt around... if you learn the game.. you won't have a
need to buy. Coming by platinum in this day and age is pretty easy...
and you'll save yourself quite a bit of cash in the process. I've
never had the need and as such never bought.
