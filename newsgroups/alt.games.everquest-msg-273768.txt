Actually I aug things I don't want to accidently sell. ;)
"Be more careful" is all well and fine, but accidents do happen... 
whether it was hitting combine on your sewing kit-cum-backpack and 
*destroying* everything in it, tripping off a cliff, standing where a 
hillgiant is about to spawn. The punishment for an accident should be 
commesurate with the avoidability and severity of misjudgement.

Getting sent 10 zones backwards, 45 minutes of travel, without your 
stuff and docked the better part of a yellow of xp for getting too close 
to a hill giants spawn point is too high a penalty. 


Raiders fighting gods suffer less when they die. (96% xp rezzes, 0 
return travel time,... worst case they fail to take the god out...)

Uh... trolls home city used to be Grobb (now Gukta) in Innothule Swamp. 
But both trolls and ogres have always been reasonably welcome in Neriak.

Extra downtime isn't a challenge. If you upped the difficulty level in 
Doom III and the only difference was that load times were tripled... 
well feeling a little ripped off would be an understatement :)

Sometimes I wonder if you are even reading what I'm writing. I like 
travel. I am not arguing to remove it from the game.

For me, the biggest flaw with slow travel is the deathport. If I die I 
should respawn in a safe spot not more than a zone away, not halfway 
around the world.

If they did that I'd be happy to remove *all* fast travel from the game.

(Of course, if that were to happen, other things would have to change 
too... like more places to sell/bank, some way of gathering for raids, 
etc...)
