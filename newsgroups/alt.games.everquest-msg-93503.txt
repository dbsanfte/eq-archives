Assuming you want one of the many regular rule servers (non-PvP, the Zek
servers and  non-Roleplay, Firiona Vie) it really makes no difference what
server you pick.  The world is PLENTY large to give you lots of space in
which to hunt by yourself.  I'm assuming that by now it may be safe to even
create a Vah Shir & have peace though you may want to wait a couple more
months.

I don't believe there's been a new regular rules server where everyone
started from level 1 (as opposed to split servers to lessen the population
of a couple overcrowded ones) for 18 months or more.
