In the market for a new computer and wondered if anyone has
experience with Dell computers? Are the parts in their computers
proprietary? How is the service?
I have priced a couple of places in my area and I have a tough time
time coming close to what a Dell can offer, but what is the catch?
The system I am considering is as follows.
Any advice on the system would also be appreciated
Thanks for any help
