This thread is awesome.  Put those damn d00d speakers in their place! 
It's funny how pissed off they get in game when you answer their
"d00d, can u give me so pp, plz?" with "Odd, a d00d speaking High Elf
(Ogre, Troll, etc). Sorry, haven't trained that language yet".  And
run off.

Some Dark Elf went off in shout for 10 minutes on me because I
answered his /shout in Shadow Haven ("Where's the kool l33t in
lucLin?") with "Cool is spelled with a C, and l33t isn't a word"

Do you want to put an end to that kind of talk?  When someone in EQ
comes up and asks for a sow, rez, etc. and uses either "plz, thx,
d00d, l33t, etc", immediately /em doesn't understand your gibberish. 
Then wave and run off without doing whatever it was they were begging
for.

I'm not a huge role player in game, but when I'm on as my wood elf
ranger, I act a whole lot differently than when I play my human monk
or ogre shaman.  Try to keep some amount of personality based on the
race/class you chose.  I suppose if a human bard called me d00d, I'd
probably say that human musicians are expected to talk a bit
differently, and may respond a bit more positively.
