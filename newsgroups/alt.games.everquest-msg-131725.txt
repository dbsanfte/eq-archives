Not better than all bards.  Unless you have 1200AC and 2200hp
completely unbuffed, and well over 1300AC and 4250hp buffed, with ATK
over 1400 with raid buffs.  
I was running a Velks Village group last night, pulling all the way to
the sentinals INSIDE the house, and was regularly holding aggro from a
60 War, 59SK, and 57PAL.  I had to work to take it from the 60monk,
but since he was pulling almost constantly (I pulled in-between his
pulls), he didn't want any aggro anyway.  Of course once our senior SK
showed up, he had no problem taking aggro from me.  :)
