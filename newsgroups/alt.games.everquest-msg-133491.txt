}From the tradeskills developer, it said for fletching and Jewelcraft
}INT/WIS/DEX whichever is higher checks agaisnt skill increase. If I find the
}link to their post I will post it here. But it only checks against one of
}them. Fails check agaisnt you JC skill.

I'm not absolutely sure, but I -think- this was a case of one tradeskill 
developer said that, and then another tradeskill developer said it was not 
so.  But either way, what the heck, dex up. :) Ohh... right, here it is on 
the EQtraders forums FAQ.  One guy said Dex was a secondary check, then it 
was somehow deduced that 'secondary check' meant that it would check that 
one if it's higher than int or wis.  Just like you just said.  Ok.  Back 
in my cage... :)
