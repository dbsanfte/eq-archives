I read a lot of the web site's pages on where to hunt for the lvl of class I 
am playing.  Most of them say around 15 - 18 depending on the class that I 
should go to OoT and hunt Sirens on the rocks.  Since these are old and we 
no longer have boats, how do I get to them?  I tried swiming out that way 
with my DRU the other day since he was raising his swimming skills, but I 
get so far and he stops.  I did not swim up and down the whole zone to see 
if there was a break, but I did go quite far and did not find one.
Are these spots still up and if so, are they good places to go in my high 
teens?
TIA
