There was a huge monk dammage problem . Pre kunark monks did about 1 and
half times the dammage of a warrior. To pay for this they also got many and
varieds *severe* restrictions. Kunark took the standard weapons a 50th used
from 8/24 to 9/18 .This was more than a 50% increase in warrior power .
Monks gained no increase at all and still kept the *severe* restrictions.
