Could you give a link to this "discussion"?  I tried the NWN newsgroup
for a while, but it was 90% morons bragging about their various cheats
(why they cheat when it is so easy to "exploit" the holes in the design
I have no idea) and 10% people begging for spoilers for the single-
player campaign.  Other placesI've looked for info on NWN (including
"official" forum) all appeared to be equally devoid of useful content,
and I already spend way too much time on EQ so I gave up on searching
thru the flyshit for the pepper.

"Oh my, we couldn't upset all those pre-adolescent 20-somethings by
having any virtual risks in their virtual adventures now, could we?"
