   And it doesn't matter that I'm a dwarf female with a beard and
only level 2?  Woot!

   Actually, it doesn't seem to slow down at least one guy on
your server (don't have his named memorized yet).  I was in the
PoK, and /ooc that I was new to the server, and asked what
everyone thought Emarr could use more of.  For all I knew, there
might be a glut of clerics.  Most people predictably /ooc'd back
that cleric was a good choice, except for one guy that /ooc'd
words to the effect that I was level 65 and a liar.  I wasn't
anon, and quickly ooc'd with my real age and vocation... level 1
at the time.  Turns out there was a level 65 necro also named
Tea-something.  They guy was very embarrassed, even though I told
him I took no offense and it was an easy mistake to make. Soon,
he cleaned his bank out for some nice items for me (level on and
I'm wearing Rygorr legs!) even though I told him that I knew how
to make money and it wasn't really an issue for me.  This was a
couple days ago... and the next couple of times I've logged on,
he's kept sending me tells.  Seems like a nice enough kid (we've
already established that I'm old enough to be his mother).  He's
just... friendly.  And persistent.

   Figures.  I come over there to stalk _you_, and get a stalker
of my own in less than an hour of play time.  Oh, and some other
guy wants me hit 3O so I can be in his guild.  I had almost
forgotten what it is like on proddie servers.
