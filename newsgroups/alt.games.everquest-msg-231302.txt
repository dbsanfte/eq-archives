What was that penalty?  When I started (much after that, obviously), we
still had the XP loss starting at level five (or six, don't recall which),
and we had to loot our corpse at every level.  I remember losing all my gear
at level 3 somewhere in the backwoods of GFay.  At the time, that included a
rusty longsword, a wooden shield bought with hard-earned copper, and a few
scraps of cloth armor.
