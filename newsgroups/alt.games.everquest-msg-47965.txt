I have the usual - bronze and few pieces of fine steel / plate.

What should I be seeking to upgrade to  enhance my stats but keep good AC?
And are able to be bought, or where do I quest to get a drop?

I recently got Seballite Scale Gloves - that was really nice, but just about
everything else is PLAIN.
