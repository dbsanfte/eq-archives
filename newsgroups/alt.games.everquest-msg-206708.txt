 Kill all mobs on right side of room (on your right when entering). Post 2
chanters on that side: one to mez the 2 robed mobs, the other for the 3
netherbians that spawn there. As mobs pop, keep them mezzed until Itaer Vius
is killed by the rest of your group. Move everyone to center at that point
and kill the mezzed mobs as they break mez and come to center.
Mobs along left wall won't aggro.
