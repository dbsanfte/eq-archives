 The monk epic makes fists into 9/16 equivalent. You would only normally
replace fists if you can find a weapon with a better ratio. For example,
Stave of Shielding is one of the best offhand weapons, pre-Velious, that
a Monk with CFs could use. With Velious and Luclin, there were a lot of
weapons out that are better than using epic fists alone. However, the
good thing about our epic is we can use better weapons and still get the
benefit of the song (ac/atk/haste).
