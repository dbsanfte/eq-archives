IANAL, but I doubt this is the case. SOE has worked very hard to
demonstrate that in-game possessions are not actual property in the
eyes of the law.

As for Yantis having no real assets, he has US$10k to offer for this
arrest. He had US$40k(?) to offer to buy Monkley Business. A single
player on torv who recently got banned detailed on the local server
board how he managed to make US$70k before they caught him. Yantis is
an aggregator. I have no doubt that his take is significantly higher.

More likely, I suspect that he just wants the guy nailed before people
start investigating around him and question the legality of his whole
operation.
