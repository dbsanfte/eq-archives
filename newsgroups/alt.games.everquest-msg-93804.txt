Well theres only 2 sentinels outside (the first door on the right is a room
totally full of them though) but that room seems a waste of time, by the
time you split 1 sentinel you've wasted so much time the dogs have started
to pop again

What does that named drop anyway, and hows he con to a 60?

I've killed Velk a lot, not really done tents much though (maybe 5 times
total), never seen him on any trip through though
