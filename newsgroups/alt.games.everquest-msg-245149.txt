This past sunday on around 11:00am EST our valiant scout team goes forth and
searches the lands for that day's potential raid targets.  Things appear
slim and grim for targets to kill that day.  Ring of Vulak is up (but this
gig in our Raid Leaders mine appears to be only slightly more palatable than
killing Tunare...), so is Yelinak, All Luclin targets are totally missing.
On the PoP side of things there is some potential, Real TZ is up, as is RZ,
but nothing else we have access too including 7th Hammer (this is boggling
since he's such a high priority kill after all...).

So at around 1pm est we gather up our forces in Tactics to go slay the 
vile Tallon Zek.  Easy clearing up to TZ and soon enough he's engaged with
our fav pally as the MT.  Tallon dies with minimal player carnage and the
masses rejoice! :)

Now...we TL out and regroup for another attempt at the Rallos script.  This
has been kinda ugly for us and we've yet to get Rallos spawned.  But our crew
is always up for things that oft lead to wipeouts when there is learning to be
had.  First part of the gig goes really really well, we get the 2 named
Decorins nicely collected and kill them handily in rapid succession.  Now
the fun begins.  Fake TZ pops and off we send the MT to get him nicely
positioned someplace in that hall.  It is nice to dream isn't it?  But,
something goes wonky and TZ gets leashed off to his happy home.  This
causes some undesired agro from god knows where and more than a little bit
of time is spent clearing up this minor horde of critters that come boiling
out to beat on us.  Finally that's over with and time to get TZ again.  
We manage to get him in the hall and not trigger his leashing but quite a bit
of the raid gets ganked during that mess.  But he dies.  All is good.  Time
for the Fake VZ now.  Something vile happened during the VZ pull as once again
we get a horde of big ogres come swarming at us and then about 40 secs later 
out comes VZ with a serious hate on for us.  Chanters drop, then cleric drop
then the tanks are dead.  this is a wipe plain and simple. :)  But a fun
wipe. :)

We didn't do too badly given only 2 chanters and 4 clerics 2 of which were
botted.  I personally think with 1 more chanter and non-botted cleric things
would have gone significantly better.  At least up to the RZ portion.  If we
had actually gotten RZ spawned in the pit I think our skilled kite time could
have held off RZ adds until we'd made a dent or possibly even killed RZ. But
that will be for next time.  I should point out at this point we had maybe
42 folks in raid.

After the fun in Tactics we debate if we should head off to Ferubi to try
the Rondo event, which would have been new and prolly filled with much
carnage.  But one of the local nearly Time alliances is doing that event and
it's hard to tell how it's going for them considering the apparant chain
rezzing that was going on with their members popping up naked and then popping
back out.  So we'll leave that for another day and head off to try one of the
Mistmoore LDON gigs.  This is somewhat amusing, 1200 hitting critters, some
kind of death limit, and maybe some kind of weird semi-uber unslowable thing
spawns when someone dies.  Also the event seems to involve whacking 3
named critters within 5% of each other.  Some folks did get some ok augs from
the trash but still after the fail we chalked that all up as a learning
experience.

Hopefully next weekend will provide us with a different set of targets and
possibly something new to kill or die to!
