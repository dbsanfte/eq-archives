Well, yes and no.
Face it, at 20+ you won't be doing a lot of meelee anymore... just about
none, actually. Although I must admit that I'm still using my Dark Ember at
level 40 to finish off some mobs, once I've got them to snare scare.
Even so, I still feel pretty bad about not maxing out my 1HS when I had the
chance. 2 reasons for this : I could REALLY dig a Bone Handled Scimitar, AND
our epic is a 1HS. Not that we would be using them much, but still...
So, up to you. I regret not maxing out my 1HS.
