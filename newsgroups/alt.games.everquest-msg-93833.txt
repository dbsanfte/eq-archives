Snowfang gnolls are decent enough fisher-folk and will give you quests if 
you have good enough faction with them.

Brother Drash is a reformed gnoll who'll give you faction hits against 
Qeynos Pallies etc if you kill him. That's probably the good gnoll 
encountered in Lake Rathe by the original poster - he spawns there and in 
SK.

Ortallius the Orc in South Ro is on Temple of Sol Ro faction, and needed 
for a couple of quests.
