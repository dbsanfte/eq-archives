I play in the early morning hours so I'm, with the rest of those
outside the USA, SOL. Your lucky if you have a GM for normal game
problems let alone an event.

 Heard from a guildmate how a GM Dragon entered Wc and was swarmed by
players. He told them to back away, they wouldn't listen, POP, he
left. Started the GM event in that zone by locking everybody out of
Kith except those the GM invited.

Then there was a post her to told us the story of how FV herself
appeared in Lesser Fay and the L3wtz d00Ds attempted to kill her
disrupting the whole storyline she was trying to act out.

They need to approach players on the down low and offer them a "secret
mission". Only those participate in ther event know it's going on. I
think that would solve the problem.

Travel. Your a druid, go to all the zones and even go into dungeons.
I've been leveling my low level chanter in WC for the last 4 levels on
assorted camps and MoBs. It amazes me how I see the same high level
faces camping the toll both or rangers day, after day, after day. If
your playing style is to find a single static MoB and  leveling on it
till the exp is gone then you will be bored.

Your only a level 30 druid. I have a level 51 druid and I still have
zones in this game I've not completely explored. The key is not to get
caught up in the "every minute needs to be getting exp" trap. Work on
trade skills, explore, play with the newbies. Focusing solely on
leveling will kill this game for you.
