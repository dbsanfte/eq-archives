I know of one instance where they did change it.  A guildie never 
distributed his extra stat points when he created his character, and 
couldn't figure out why his stats sucked so much compared to the rest of 
the guild.  He petitioned, was able to show that when naked he had the 
starting stats for his race/class, and was able to distribute his as yet 
unused bonus points.  Found it much easier to hit 200 wisdom.
