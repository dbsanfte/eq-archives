EQW was used for some time because it fixed many mouse cursor issues with
the built in window mode.
Then people discovered the application compatibility toolkit, which did a
better job that eqw, so Id say eqw is pretty dead.
Probably the only using it are those that dont know about the tookit.

EQplaynice will die faster since they are charging money for redunant
software.
Its alwasy been possible to startup eq in low priority mode if you cant run
backgroup applications.
You cant *change* the process priority, but you can start it up in low
priority.
