Agreed, that's why I doubt I'll get past 20. I'm a very slow player. I'm 
familiar with mmorpgs (played AC, DAoC, SWG, Horizons (barely), Neocron 
and currently CoH) but what I've been missing since my early days of AC 
is that immersion that I loved when i first played a MMORPG. I'm trying 
to approach EQ that way. I'm taking the time to read everything, I'm not 
using the web to figure out the uber templates or how to level to 20 in 
2 days (after probably 5 hours I'm at level 4).

Even though the graphics for EQ are really dated, it is very easy to get 
into the world for some reason. It's tough to put my finger on it but it 
really has something different from the other newer MMORPGs like SWG. Of 
course, I've only been playing for a couple days so we'll see how I feel 
  at the end of my 30 days. :D

Thanks for all the tips to everyone that replied.

Zach
