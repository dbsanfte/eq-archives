My boys got me into playing recently.  Am I still a newbie after
a month?  Anyway, my question is where should I hunt?  I am a
level 12, (barely), druid wood-elf.  I hunted close to Greater
Faydark until about 10.  Then one son suggested I go to Eastern
Commons.  I returned a 12, and he then took me to Crushbone.
If the baddies didn't attack in such large numbers I might be
all right there.

My boy's advice is to join groups.  That's what he does.  I am
certainly not opposed to that, but I'm just curious as to where
would be the best place to gain experience at this point.

I think it's likely the best answer to this is the one my son has
given me already?  What do you think?  Thanks for any advice.
What a cool game.

Bill
