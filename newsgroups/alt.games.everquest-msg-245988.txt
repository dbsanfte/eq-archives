Does anyone know if you have several wins in LDoN and you remove your
adventure stone from one item and get another and put it some other
item, will your stone update with the proper stats? Or can you redo
the hail to the npc and get it updated?

I chose poorly on what item to put it on and want to move it.. I like
13 wins in EF and 19 wins in NRO and don't want to lose the stats,
meager as they are at that level :)
