I'm far from an expert, but i'll take a guess...

The monk can solo pretty well from what i've seen, but this works
a heck of a lot better with some top end gear and the skills quite
highly developed. Low/mid level they still take so much damage that
their downtime is sizable. I think the advantage (apart from mend)
is that defensive skills can mean total avoidance of some damage.
If things go wrong they're going to get pounded, but at least they
always have FD to fall back on.

The paladin has healing and root which means they can solo. But they
don't deliver all that much damage, which means their mana recovery
downtime (assuming they actually win) is sizable. I've been sitting
beside a L52 paladin who soloed a hill giant (way green to him). He
won, but boy did he take a beating in the process. Soloing undead
is better, but still a slow way to get xp.

I've never seen a high level shadownight soloing. In theory they
should be able to fear-kite to decent effect. They've still got
relatively low damage output and fairly mana inefficient healing
to keep their downtime up.

In most cases gear seems to make the difference. A monk with
epic can deliver insane damage. A fungi tunic, or the paladin
helm, can make healing much more viable. But if your an averagely
equipped melee I don't think i'd bother.

Mind you, i'm a rogue, I will almost certainly lose to a blue
at my level (38) and will have horrendous downtime should I win.
But at least I can use stealth to spend 10+ minutes sitting on
my butt safely :)
