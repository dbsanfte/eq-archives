 Sitting in GFay and asking for a SoW to get to CB 30 seconds faster
and fighting for your life trying to kill Trak are two different 
matters. For me ANY abbreviation on a raid that's understandable is
fine, even encouraged. However, a person sitting at the Orc lift 
asking for the services of another person has plenty of time to ask
politely.

 Exactly my feelings as well.
