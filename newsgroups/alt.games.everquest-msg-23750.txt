Ok, it's not *really* true, classic "sword and sorcery", but if you want
some light reading that's in a magic based world, go get any of the
Terry Pratchett novels about Discworld. You'll laugh your ass off, and a
lot of it often reminds me of EQ.  I have read every one and seriously
enjoyed all of them but one or two. The early ones are very good reads.
But they aren't exactly a "series" as such, so they don't have to be
read in order, though there are many repeating characters. The one
titled "Guards Guards" was particularly good IMO.
