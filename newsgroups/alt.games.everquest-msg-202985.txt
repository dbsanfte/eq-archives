Actually, I was thinking in terms of what ninja means in EQ jargon,
not what it means in other contexts.  So, start with the idiocy of
PP in a non-PK game with restrictions on looting NPC corpses and
tons of "house rules" against any sort of grief play, including
"defrauding" other players of their hard-won pixels.  This gives
you a large fraction of the player base who are very unlikely to
invite an unknown Rogue to group, even if their best damage dealer
is a ghetto Paladin.  Then you name that Rogue some variation of
"ninja", which in EQ jargon translates as "bottom dwelling scum
sucker who steals from his group and guild".

Catch my drift?
