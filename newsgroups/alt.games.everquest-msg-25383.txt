Okay time for more detail.

Yes it does run on Win2k Pro. It better, or it isn't going to run on WinXP
which is just Win2k with some new features that you probably won't use.

My config was....

Athlon 800
512 MB of Ram (less than $100 for that much ram, so why not?)
Geforce2 32MB DDR
Hercules Game Theater XP (any of the Cirrius Logic sound cards will work
just fine for EQ in Win9x or Win2k on an AMD system. SBLive is just asking
for problems seeing has how the last REAL driver update Creative Labs did
was in 1999)
MS Sidewinder Stratigic commander

The primary issue is drivers. If your hardware has DX7 or DX8 drivers,
you'll be fine.

Hopefully the Lucin expasion will fix the persistant sound issues. The only
sound problem I have with the Game Theater is that it isn't reliably
Directional under Win2k Pro. Win9x yes, Win2k no.....

I let that slide for EQ becuase unlike say Half Life:Counter Strike,  sound
coming from a certian direction isn't going to kill you if you are paying
attention.
