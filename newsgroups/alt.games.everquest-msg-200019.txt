    Two factors:

(1) KEI. With more people buying expensive buffs, people get a lot more
upset when they lose all buffs when zoning. "Your jackass system cost me
blah blah blah." Keep the buffs, stop the heat on Customer Service.
(2) Bug as advantage. It's become common practice to advise players dying of
DoTs to zone and strip the DoT. Players that should have died live because
of a "feature" not intended to save them. Whenever players use a piece of
iffy coding to their advantage, the nerf stick goes "THWACK".
