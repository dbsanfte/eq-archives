It's coming up on time for the monthly posting of the FAQ, and I find
I'm not sure how to summarise the new expansion (partly because I haven't
gotten around to buying it myself :-).  Anyone care to take a crack at a
one-paragraph description of the highlights?

For reference, here's what I came up with for DoD (which I also haven't
bought yet):

Commonly called DoD, this adds new, mostly high-level content (for
levels 45+) off Nektulos Forest.  Players with this expansion can also form
groups that, regardless of their character levels, can take on "monster
missions", where they take the role of monsters in an instanced event (such
as a dragon defending its lair); success in these missions yields rewards
for the "real" characters.  Characters can also get "spirit shrouds" that let
them take on "monster" forms with different abilities (e.g., a cleric could
play as a warrior-type monster, or vice versa).  The expansion also added
"evolving items" that become more powerful as their owner gains experience.
