With the exception of the druid, those examples cost more than just mana.  I
have no reason to expect a necro to be carrying around essence emeralds, and
I would expect the Cleric to symbol me if I handed him a dot.  As far as the
druid goes, their ports require them to go where they may not have gone,
possibly re-binding where they may not have wanted to bind.  In other words,
I am costing those classes by putting apon them to do those tasks.  Now, how
am I putting a group cleric out by asking for a rez?  It requires no
component, and he doesn't have to go far, except in the case of a long CR
(possibly due to an evac).

> wants it period? Answer to all is no, Unless you are paying for my EQ

I'm not paying for your EQ account, but I'm inviting you into the group, and
I'm keeping your ass from being pounded on by Mr. Big, Bad Mob.  If you wish
to continue grouping with me, you'll pull your weight.

Don't call me "son," you don't know jack shit about me.

It's a social contract.  I let you group with me, and you enjoy the benefits
of not getting your ass kicked by that red or yellow mob.  I enjoy the
benefits of having my HP replenished faster than they're being lost, and the
benefit of a rez if the cleric can't accomplish the above job.  There may be
no controlling legal authority in the game, but there are things that we
obligate ourselves to, whether they can be enforced or not.

The lack of rules does not mean that there are no obligations or agreements.
