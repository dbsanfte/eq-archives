What time? Takes about 10 seconds to send a petition.

/petition naming rules violation: Fuckhead. Currently in Kithicor
/report Fuckhead

I generally petition all blatant real world reference names, especially
anything to do with vulgarity, profanity, racism, hate generating names.

Names I have petitioned:

Kunnalingus << actually had to explain that one to a guide.
Niggaraper << personally thanked by the GM an hour later.
Hittller << first time I ever saw a GM warp into the zone in 20 seconds.
Battmann

I generally don't petition names that are cute or clever but I do not
begrudge others that do petition them. But I will petition them if
that player pisses me off.
