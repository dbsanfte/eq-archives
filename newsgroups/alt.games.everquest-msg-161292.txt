Why is bard listed as harder then the shadowknight.  Talk about time sinks,
i have a real life friend that made more then 100 trips to the planes to get
just one piece that he needed.  I've looked at the bard one quite thoroughly
and besides the trak fight (which the bard version is a 2 grouper) i don't
think its that hard at all.  I can see some time sinks in the necro but if
you haven't seen the sk epic go take a look at the requirements again.  The
last fight alone is a pain with Llranc.

-Pail.
