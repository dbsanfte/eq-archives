My melee had lagged badly on my shaman, at level 65, I finally rectified 
my piercing and offense situation.  I went to Fungus Grove, and soloed a 
bunch of low dark blue mobs.  Of course, now that I bagged my epic for a 
1hb, I am working on raising that.  It was at 60 when I got the 1hb 
weapon, up to 88 so far just from smacking mobs on a raid.
