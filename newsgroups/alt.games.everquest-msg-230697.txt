Hm i got my first kei on my main, now a 56 cleric when she was 48...i 
was in a ringwar and got kei'ed as part of a generall buffing being done.

I still get it most of the time, but have done raids, LDoN adventures 
and regular hunting sessions without it. It isnt impossible, just takes 
attention to detail and mana control=)

I dont have any problem with playing my alts and not being able to get 
kei on them...it is just lik i started out playing=) I can still 
remember when getting 'mind candy' - int. enhancement and breeze was 
incredible=)
