You can actually get Coca Cola made with Sugar as opposed to Corn
sweeteners... At least in Texas... A lot of the Fiesta Supermarts &
other Mexican shops have Mexican Cokes for sale... They are made of
sugar, and are Oh so tasty! And they mix so well with Rum, that's I
cry when I have to put a regular coke in with it!
