Expensive enough that I'd have to farm cash to fund extensive use of 
them. I have no desire to do that; besides I have the gate hammer. Just 
need to ding once to use it, so why blow the cash; I'll be 50th soon 
enough. And theres lots of other places to go.

Examples?

Doable with a group of 3-5 50ths? Likely to drop within this century at 
the kill rate a half-to-full group of 50ths is likely to be able to 
sustain. (e.g. Camping *near* the Kael arena with 3 49ths (clr, mnk, 
sk), each even or dark blue single pull took a couple minutes to kill, 
completely burned the clr out of mana, and if we screwed up and got an 
add we had to FD/gate/or die)

And you know what they dropped? 3-5pp and frost giant meat. According to 
EQbestiary we weren't even killing mobs that -could- drop something 
worth getting. (Ironically the lower level giants dropped seargent 
swords that were worth some decent pp at least)

I would -love- to see a list of 75k items that a group of untwinked 
50ths could obtain that would likely drop this year given a kill rate of 
6-12 kills per -hour- if there are no adds/deaths.

Once I'm 60th+? Sure I could made a pretty good run through Kael-like 
mobs with a decent group. But at 60th I'm right in range of getting the 
brand new stuff in OoW... so why go to Kael to camp named and their 
ultrarares for a thousand hours when OoW trash mobs drop decent (better) 
stuff.

I don't beleive that. Do you?

More content? Yes. Worthwhile content (given the likely equipment they 
will already have going into it)? No. There is some content... but not 
nearly as much as your making out. And just because good gear drops from 
these zones that doesn't make it worth the time to camp ultra rares; 
even for a casual... hell --especially-- for a casual with limited time.
