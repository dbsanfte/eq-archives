Given the topic of the thread, though, I am clearly interested.

Why?  Because its part of the fun.  Why don't I melee with a rusty
mace?  All in all the difference between that and righteousness
isn't all that much, compared to the difference between two high
end melee weapons in the hands of a 60 monk.

But GIVEN that I'm interested in melee, isn't it... well logical
isn't the word, but clear on an "emotion quotient" level that I'd
be interested in the best pathetic output I can manage?

Both these weapons are no drop.  I already own them both.
Their non-melee stats are nearly identicle, except that they
have completely non-overlapping saves... so I want to keep
both, and which I hold at any given moment doesn't matter
save for melee purposes.

Recall also that I contend that melee damage does not
interfere with medding if I'm sufficiently motivated do
bounce.  Now you need to compare melee output not
to nuke and med, but to medding without meleeing.
Clearly some is more than none at all... perhaps not
noticably more, but since I have other melee messages
off, I only see what I'm doing, and frankly my 40
bard would Love to have this kind of output (closest
thing to a melee I have to compare with)
