In pickup groups I think I have only done high once.  In guildy groups we
usually figure the average level and go high if we decide we are below the
cutoff and a good group.  For us the break is 63 so if we are average 62.5
and we want a 65 adventure we go high.  If we have some non-guildies with us
that we arent sure about we generally go normal.
