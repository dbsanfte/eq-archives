No problem people do that all the time before 10, after ten, you put
everything you own in the bank and have someone duel you.

They beat you, you pop back to your bind point and return to the bank.

Not an exploit, it's a feature. I use it for mules. Bind mule in
freeport bank, run to LZ, get schtuff, run high up a wizzy spire and
jump, or deeper into a dungeon zone. Die and TP to FP bank.
