Very true.  I have yet to actually meet a female that liked this
movie.

I dunno, most of the plot holes I've heard people mention *CAN* be
explained away by the fact that the whole movie is told from Norton's
point of view.  His subconscious skews his perception.  Only real
problem I had was....

Possible Spoilers.  If you haven't seen Fight Club, haven't heard
anything about it and want to see it, you might not want to continue
on.




























I don't really see ANYBODY wanting to join Fight Club after watching
Norton stand around a parking lot kicking the shit out of himself no
matter how slick a talker "Tyler" is.

Other than that, I LOVE the movie.  It was funnier than hell, smart,
and clever.  Big thumbs up all around.
