Well, Tarbul Earthstrider in EK has really bad faction with my guild ... so
we got up my 46 necro, 51 druid, 53 mage, 52 necro and 34 ranger and went to
get revenge. Ranger is traking him and we get to his spot, but no Tarbul.
Hmm .. We thought track was screwed again. Then the mage just drops a AoE
over the ranger and Bang! Tarbul gets hit. He was somewhere under the zone.
So the mage starts dumping mana into him. Tarbul did not hit back tho ..
after a bit the other necro is hit by the giant and he manages to target it
somehow. Hehe ..we all /assist and we start blastig him and doting for
thousands and thousands of damage .. every now and then the giant would
attack one of us. Yes, we petitioned but no GM showed up (gee..thats' new).
After a while we got bored and left .


Hmm .. I cant remember what I did next
