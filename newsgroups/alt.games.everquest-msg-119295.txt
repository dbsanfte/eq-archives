Quack. Biggest aggro getter low mana chain casting tool
in the rangers arsenal:

Flame Lick.

DoT. Debuff. Combined in one.

They dont like it at all, and as a level 9 spell it has a
miniscule cast time and mana cost.

Also set up your own version of the taunt key that does something
like:

Taunt
Kick
Disarm
Flame lick
Snare

You'll find when you need to peel something off your crunchy
lover it works very well ;)
