I just entered the game after loading the last patch and decided to see how
things were doing by porting around the various zones.  BB and WC seemed
fine, but when I entered EC all the mobs and characters there seemed to be
floating in the air, the same was true in the bank zone in FP, but can not
tell if other zones had this problem too as the game crashed when I was
memming gate to check out Ill Omen.  I just installed a Geforce 2 PCI card
so I cannot tell if this is some strange effect from that move or a problem
created by the last patch.  Anyway since I saw a message saying servers
would be down it may well be that what I encountered was a game bug and is
being fixed at this moment.  Unfortunately, I seemed to have entered the
game after the down time was announced and so I cannot tell whether this was
the cause of my having to leave the game or if it was something else.  Any
information on this problem would be appreciated.
