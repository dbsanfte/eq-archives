My enchanter was keeping those stupid pages for quite awhile on Bristlebane.
Worked up research to help others.  Often if I couldn't bother to find the
pages I would just go out and buy them.  I'd buy all pages in the area for
cheap, so I'd often be running to various places just to get pages while
hunting in various places.  like in Unrest, Oasis, or that lizzie cazic
thule hunting zone.  My enchanter has a natural hatred towards all lizzies.
Call him sick, but after killing and being killed by them, he just doesn't
like them.  If they were less "evil", he probably wouldn't have a problem
with them.  After the new kunark came out, he had a hard time adjusting.
took a little bit of time before his natural hatred of them died down.  ROFL
Nothing like running for pages only to get trained by those damn defenders.
Anyhows, if your concerned with money, you can definitely make a profit
(with some effort) with researching skill.  Like any skill, it takes time
and effort, but in the end you will be helping those who don't wanna bother,
and also be able to make a profit.  I'd basically charge like 20 plat for
higher level spells, and when it started to get even higher end, charge 30
plat for research spells.  It got to a point where jewelry crafting was just
more valuable and I didn't need to research any more ( verant decided to
just have critters drop them instead of researching for new luclin spells, I
guess)

Thinking on this, and not playing Luclin much even after I got my new comp,
wondering if the new spells for enchanters are even dropping.  Like I went
to shadow haven to buy the neato 10 % less agro etc, only to find its
dropped by critters only?  I'm sure most here have been playing luclin, and
would appreciate your knowledge on the subject for this backward Enchanter
who has been doing other stuff.  ::sob::

have a 57th enchanter on bristlebane w/ 300 K + plat, 18 blue diamonds, and
other various pieces of tidbits.  250 JC, and master in many skills, almost
a master in all languages e.g.  (for example)
