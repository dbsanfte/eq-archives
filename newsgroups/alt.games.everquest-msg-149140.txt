All of these options are assuming that your gear doesn't suck, or that
you're not a gimpy player.

Siren's Grotto on the WW end or the two ledges just before the waterfall,
charm a servant manatee/walrus/sea elephant and use it to kill enthralled
bulthar/ulthork/molkor.  (seahorses and servant swordfish are immune to
root/snare, see invis, and will agro, but they won't follow you out of the
water; in fact, jumping out of the water will remove you from their agro
unless you have them dotted)

Root/rot Phase Spiders in DN.  Watch out for their shadow step proc, and
don't step on the bones.

Charm a dog in Chardok and use it to kill stuff, then break charm when pet
is low and kill it too.  (btw Cel, no problems single pulling at 56)

If you were one level higher (takes 56 to single pull for sure) you could
solo at the bank in kael, not great exp, but loot is decent, and chance for
some thurg quest armor to drop.  You'll need to be careful though, some
giants have a tendency to break root a lot (and Korakaz summons).

The Hole entrance elementals, highest level ones max hit for 102, lower ones
for less; some will be light blue, but it's a fun change of pace.  They have
ridiculously low hp (2k-2500 or so), but are resistant to root, so I just
regrowth and DS up and porcupine them while they die to DoT and DS I get my
melee skills up a bit.  However, they can take me down to 30% hp in a fight,
of ~1950 hp self buffed, and with me having around 930 AC.

Quad the Eternal Golems around the outside of Ssraeshza temple in the Grey
(really low hp), chance of An Ancient Shissar Servitor spawning that drops
the Golem Jawbone.  Just keep invis and repulse animal up for the inevitable
trains or usnareable worm traps.
