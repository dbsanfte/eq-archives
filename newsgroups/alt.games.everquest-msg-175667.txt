As you're a bard - we'll use one of your songs for the example.

Verses of victory is listed at Caster's Realm as being 30% haste.

That means a 30percent increase in attacks per unit time.

Take for example a 10/20 weapon. 

Without haste, this weapon gets 30 swings per minute
With VoV you get 30 x 1.3 or 39 attacks per minute.

If you want to figure the change to the effective delay
it's (Original Delay) x (100/100 + (Haste Percentage))

Or 20x(100/130) 
or 20 x .77
or 15.4

As a quick double check on my math - 60/15.4 is approximately
39 attacks.
