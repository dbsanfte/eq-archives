The "sense" spells are generally dirt cheap, and easily chain
cast in order to work up your divination skill.  99% of your
life you'll have no use for em for a variety of reasons:

They select -only- the closest mob of the correct type,
unlike track which gives you a list.

They don't tell you jack about whats in between you
and that mob, while track will at least tell you whats
closer than that mob, kind of a heads up.

At least they fixed it so they don't show pets; sense
undead used to be a way to find your buddy the
necromancer, and little else.  Sense animal would,
I imagine, have showed the nearest druid or shaman
more often than not.

Most animal zones are rich in the critters, and have decent
line of sight... you just use the mark one eyeball to
find em.  Similar things happen with sense undead and
sense summoned.

You -can- use sense undead for finding a couple quest mobs
out there, the guy that drops parts for the gold bracers, that
sort of thing.  Possibly there's a similar animal pop in a zone
without a lot of other animals in the way.  Can't think of one,
but then I never got my shaman very far along, too many other
twinks to try.
