Sang,

I believe the concept that Carlo is stating here in comparison is the fact that
the HP that the wizard would be stealing in this case is HP that he/she can get
back them safe. Namely, the Rune style effect on the wizard epic. The Manarobe
would be taking the HP equivalent granted by the epic and converting it to mana.
The epic would then inturn replace the lost HP equivalent. Granted, it is not
exact because of casting times on the Manarobe and wizard epic when compaired to
the insta-cast of the Manastone. But it is pretty darn close and inturn granted
to a class that is just about exclusively DD casting based class with no
alternative method of damage.
