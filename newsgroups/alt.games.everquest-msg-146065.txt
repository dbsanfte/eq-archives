Heh, same here.

Post patch, there are, in theory, no hell levels anymore.  If you thought 56
was bad prepatch, then I suspect you will be unhappy after the patch.  The
XP the the old hell levels has been redistributed such that it takes the
same XP as before to get from 50 to 60, but it is a more even progression
from level to level.  As far as your XP bar, it should look the same pre and
post patch.
