Pickup raids are highly variable in quality...

The healing method should be determined up front on anything but a 
trivial raid.  It might be a heal rotation, it might be fast heals, it 
might be a combination.  If noone is doing this up front, try to take the 
initiative, or find someone who knows the raid, and can do so.

So long as all are in agreement on what the messages are, it's probably 
not that important.  Always be ready to pick up the slack if the one 
before you does not appear to cast for whatever reason.  One reason the 
numbers are better than just a name, is if the named cleric goes oom, or 
dies, or LDs, then it's easier to track by number rather than trying to 
decide if you were after whoever_next_cleric_was.

And this is why I don't lead raids...
