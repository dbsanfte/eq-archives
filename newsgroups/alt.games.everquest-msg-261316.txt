Well annoying people tend to be abundant, but it depends on what you find
annoying.  I have found that when an experienced player comes across a truly
new player, then they are more than willing to help the other out.  As far
as people scamming, you are only as vulnerable as you are naive, but I
haven't heard of anyone being scammed out of anything in a while.  I would
say you're pretty safe in regards to this question.

No, you will not be able to play EQ without deaths.  Death is a part of the
game and it will happen. The death penalty is the loss of about 5-10% of
your current level's experience and you must travel from a "bind" point,
usually withing a city area, back to your body.  These effects can be
mitigated by the use of various in game spells, such as resurrection that
returns you to your body and restores a set percentage of experience.  You
WILL die.  Before level 10 there is no penalty for death, so you can get
used to game mechanics.

EQ is huge.  There are many many places you could go at each level to gain
experience.  There, however, will not always be other people in these zones
if you choose a class that requires a group.  People tend to go to the zone
which allow for the fastest leveling rather than exploring new areas.

If you are in a balanced group, then yes you can.  If you wish to solo, then
differing classes allow for different amounts of downtime.  Generally the
classes that solo the best have the least amount of downtime.

There are certain classes that lend themselves to solo play more than
others.  Druid, necromancer, beast lord, wizard are the foremost examples in
no particular order.

For the most part, no.  Usually a group will want to have no more than a 5
level disparity between the highest level person and the lowest level
person.

There are ingame tactics that involve using various spells to hinder your
enemies.  Use of game geometry to prevent an enemy from reaching you is
considered an exploit.

I would say certainly less hectical.

As far as Internet latency, I have guild members in Spain and France who
have no problems playing on a US server.  There is a server based in Germany
(I want to say Venril Sathir, but I could be mistaken) if you are having
trouble connecting to a US server.  As for server availability there is
usually an announced patch about once a month where the servers will come
down.  If there are major game changes being made (release of a new
expansion, new graphics system) then there are often follow up patches.

As a newbie, you will not miss any content by not owning PoP.  LoY is aimed
at players in the levels 40-60 range.  LDoN, however, is where much of the
grouping occurs these days.  If you only want to solo, then don't worry
about it.  It will, however, probably be where groups want you to go.


> thanks a lot for helping me :-)
Best of luck!  You get a month free, so try out EQ and see if it is the game
for you.  Let us know what you think.
