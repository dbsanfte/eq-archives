Its a bit kludgy at the moment I'll admit, but thats not a case of the 
game not having a usable solution, its a case of someone screwing up a 
usable solution.

For years I quite happily used F8 to select almost every mob I'd kill, 
it was actually quite reliable; it would pick the closest mob in my 
vision arc.  Only when I specifically needed to get other mobs, say to 
lull back mobs or something along those lines would I need to use the 
mouse to target.  Recently its been less reliable... but thats not a 
design issue, its execution.

Which matters to me because?  I use any view other than 1st person about 
once every 6 months!

/tar a-g will do it.  I had no idea, till this thread brought it up, but 
with some experimentation I've found it quite useful.  All you need to 
do is get enough letters in there to be unique within your targeting 
range, so if you've been pulling back away from other mobs and looting 
every kill this will take care of the problem.

Also suggested has been f1 f1 assist; apparantly your pet will target 
the corpse if it hasn't been given a new target.

I'm not keyboard oriented enough to use this instead... but it sounds 
like you would be if it was easy enough, which is where the /tar a-g 
thing might pay off.
