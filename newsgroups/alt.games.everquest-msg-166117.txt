The main problem with PoI is that Sony seems to have intentionally
designed it to stop any form of kiting, be it singles or quadding. The
channels you have to travel in for much of it are simply too narrow, and
the random encounters include too many wanderers who cover large
stretches of these channels. This means there's precious little room to
run. Even if you're trying to run a snared mob back and forth in a tiny
section of a channel, (a technique I have employed to good effect in
tight spots like the gnoll caves in JPF) it's not doable. They are
skinny enough that when you attempt to loop back past the mob, you have
to get in it's aggro range. My one experience with that showed me that
most PoI trash mobs can hit hard enough to burn through my epic skin in
one round, plus put enough hurt on me on top of that to slow me down. As
you say, the graveyard, small as even it is, looks to be the only spot
big enough to do it, and even I'm not enough of an asshole to kite
there.
