Its one buff slot, assuming you have 1250+ AC.  However, if you are pure melee..
well, I did say "for mana using classes".  Virtue is custom made for Warriors and of
interest to rogues and monks and bards (bards are mana using but don't benefit from
mana regen)

Ah, well my post is about the fact that I'm 63 with no spells and am not flagged for
Valor/Storms/HoH.

If I was flagged for those zones, presumably I'd get 63 spells, and I wouldn't be
suffering from the massive drop in exp giving mobs going from 62 to 63.

My point was, stop leveling at 62.99999, go pure AA, and stay there till you get a
flag, because 63 without any 63 spells doesn't mean much, and the exp nerf sure
sucks.
