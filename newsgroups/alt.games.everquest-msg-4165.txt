It has to do with the size of the group and the location.

If you're hunting mobs that consistantly drop 3 - 5 pp in coins, and you're in
a 6 person group  (quite a few mobs are seeming to fall into this range for me
between Level 30 - 40).   In this case, 90% of the time, the looter will get
almost everything.

If you're hunting hill giants, with an average drop of almost 40 pp, in a
group of 4 people....   Every person will be getting around 9, with the looter
getting a max of 12.

It all depends on how much of a percent that extra 3 - 5 pp is.  When it
represents less than 10% of the total loot, it's no big deal.   When it comes
out more like 90%, it can be a big deal when one person is repeatedly looting
everything.
