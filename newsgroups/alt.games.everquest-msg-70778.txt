Which then leads to the question.....

"Why even bother with an Alignment/Religion server at all?"

On the normal EQ servers most people go agnostic (whenever possible)
to have the best faction possible. Replace "agnostic" with "Nuetral"
and you have the FV server.

Doesn't seem like much of a change to me. The only thing the FV server
does is make sure Evils and Goods do not mix. I bet that the nuetrals
outnumber the true evils/goods by several factors.
