What happens after I do? I think my corpse has fallen out of a zone - me and
someone else ran all over the place I thought I died (and I died again in
the process!), summoning my corpse like mad, but nothing happened.
I've done a /petition stating my problem, but I'm wondering how the GMs are
going to get in touch with me. Will I get an email, or will I have to stay
logged on for hours hoping that the GMs read my petition?

Thanks,

Rich
