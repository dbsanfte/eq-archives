As someone out of EQ for a couple years, could someone explain to me
how the barter system works?  Is it like the bazaar system but with
items instead of money?  Yeah I could go look it up but I'm behind a
picky proxy at work :)

Is it available to anyone or was it part of the DoN patch?

Err... what did they look like? :/

It's funny, this alone makes me want to sign up again, just to cruise
around my old stomping grounds, and check out the new views.  The
seasonal changes thing sounds interesting; kinda makes me wonder why
they waited 6 years to implement it, but oh well.

That one sounds funny.  "Hey, that's MY pet you bitch!"  Could
warriors end up with a pet?  (They haven't given pets to warriors yet,
right?  I mean, SOE does have limits I hope?)
