As long as you're careful (since somebody will try to train you) you should
be able to solo wyverns in Cobalt Scar just fine, and single pull everywhere
except maybe the tower and the obelisk.

Average coin, lots of words and meat, uncommon wyvern hide (2pp or so to
vendor in same zone or for tailoring) and uncommon velious armor quest gems
or vendor crap gems (41pp a pop in same zone)

My advice would be to destroy meat, copper, silver, (gold if you really need
to), stockpile words/runes/pages until you're near full up, same for gems
and hides, then sell to the othmir and go bank in skyshrine (one zone away).

Of course if you're kos to skyshrine, uhh... fix that first.  And don't try
to kill drakes or Yvolcarn.

Also you can get a shroom group in Fungus Grove most likely, nice exp,
occasional spell you might get to roll on, nice crap loot for cash (shrieker
flesh etc) and bank/vendors in same zone.  I see people there at all times
farming AA/spells.

Or if you don't mind an obnoxious run to town to buy/sell/bank every couple
hours, the Burning Woods giant fort is good money.
