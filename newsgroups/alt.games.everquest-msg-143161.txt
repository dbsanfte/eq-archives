Stein of Moggok is probably the best ratio you can get in terms of int
gained per plat spent.  On my server, they go for 150 to 250. 
Enchanters can easily farm this after binding in the firepot room now,
so the supply of these has kept the price pretty low (considering it's
a +10 int item).

That's the only item that really stands out for what you are looking
for.  For other int items, it's probably best to use the /bazaar
function and compare prices on various int items.  Try several times
throughout the day before buying.
