I don't agree with anything that resembles a pyramid scheme.  The
refer in the link you posted suggested that *you* get the benefit
while the other try to take advantage of the freebies.

Not only you have to buy something, you also have to get a few more
people to sign up and buy something in your name to earn the free
monitor (or iPod or whatever).  Worse yet, the info is sold to every
mailing list and spam so you get mail box (both postal and email)
stuffed full of spams.
