Someone with too much freetime (gee a common theme these days while
everyone is waiting on SoL), did some log parsing.  Basically 100AC
translates to about 10% damage reduction.

That means a level 60 warrior with 1300AC under defensive takes about
as much damage as a level 60 warrior with 1600AC without
defensive--this was the pattern folks were seeing when they add new
warriors to their guild (the new ones having weaker equipment than the
more senior ones).

The highest non-haste AC belt in the game (ironically enough the top
three all have 40% haste on them) is AC25 the Silvery Girdle of
WeighsWayTheFuckTooMuch (which interestingly enough no meleer wanted
and ended up on my freaking druid?!?).

Against an FBSS, that's a delta of 25 AC.  Which is about 38 total AC.
That's less than 4% more damage the warrior has to take. 

Now check the percentage of the haste of the FBSS.  Now calculate the
added benefit of that haste *AND* the fact that you'll be killing the
mob just that much faster (thus overall reducing the damage you have
to take).
