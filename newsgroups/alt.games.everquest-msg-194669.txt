You've obviously never had a tank wimpering for haste in the middle of
a fight. <g>

You probably need to add pullng to that list. Any camp where I'm the
only healer, odds are I'll be doing the pulling too. It just makes
things go a lot smoother if I can pull with malo and have it slowed by
the time anyone in the group engages. That also lets me root park,
malo and slow any adds on the way back to camp. Even with pullers I
know and trust, we usually seem to do better with me pulling on a
small outdoor 2 or 3 person exp camp.

Before PoP I would've argued the point. Back then a 'classic' CC group
with cleric, chanter, shaman could always get comparable exp to a high
DPS single pulling group. You could hit the cool dungeons (Seb,
Chardok, HS, DN, the Hole. CT) with exp bonuses and kill mobs just as
quickly since you didn't have the wasted time between every kill while
waiting for the next pull. You'd grab 5 to 8 at a time, kill non-stop
for 10 minutes, then grab another train. Just as efficient over time
and a helluva lot more fun. 

Now with PoV/S, anyone that could master pulling in Dreadlands can
have an easy, quick exp road to 65 so that isn't the case any more. On
the bright side, it does leave CoD pretty much empty on Bristlebane.
At least for those times when there's a real tank around,
Unslow/mez/snare/rootable mobs that hit for over 700 tend to put a
damper on casual groups. Plus, CoD even has loot! 

... speaking of CoD loot, if there's any paladin on Bristlebane that
would like a Mace of the Fallen Crusader, drop me a note here (my
hotmail address is fake) or give Thurdar a tell in game. It does have
a recommended level so you probably need to be at least mid 30s to get
a decent ratio out of it.
