Yes, that's why I'm asking.  That's what I thought, but in the Prima guide
there were runes in the Necro area as well.  I'm having trouble locating it
at the moment even though I had the damn thing in my hand this morning, but
it didn mention runes.  I'll post what it says later if I can find the book.
