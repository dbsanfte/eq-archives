I may be a moron, but I know overreacting when I see it.
A few people in this newsgroup have been screaming "the
sky is falling!" every since the changes were announced.
You are one of those people.

Being proud that you recognize the bugs and don't complain
is foolish consumer behavior.  Consumers should bitch --
frequently and loudly -- when things don't work right.  You
are not doing Verant or the users of Verant's products any
favors by advocating silence when things go wrong.

I think my comprehensive skills are pretty good, but you're
free to have your own opinion on the matter.

I'm definately not a powergamer.  None of my characters are
over level 21 (I had one at 24 which I deleted, though).
I've never powered leveled nor been power leveled and I play
the game to enjoy it, not grind exp.

I'd never get from 1-50 in a week because I don't play EQ
that much, and when I do, I spend a lot of that time helping
newbies, chatting with guildmates, etc.  Powergamer?  Me?
Not even remotely close.
