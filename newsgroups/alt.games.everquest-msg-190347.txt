First someone has to go to his or her trainer and train at least one point
in the given language.  Then, she groups with another person and spams him
in the new language.  She can teach him up to one point higher than her
current skill, so if her skill is 1, he can learn up to 2 from her.  Now,
they both need to zone in order to update their language skills.  This
process continues with each person teaching one level higher until a skill
of 100 is reached.

The easiest way to learn the player race languages (Troll, Elven, etc) is to
have a friend make a new character in the desired race and learn all the
languages the new character knows.
