As I recall it, what you write is correct.  The overhaste songs don't
appear in the lineup until levels 50 or higher (as my bard never got
above 40, that was all I ever really needed to know).  Unless the bard
in your group was at least level 50 AND singing specifically an
overhaste song (Ervaj line, etc.), the haste does not stack with other
spell haste.  I have absolutely no idea when, historically, the
overhaste songs were introduced or whether they are even available on
the Progression servers.
