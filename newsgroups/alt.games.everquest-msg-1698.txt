If you'd like to buy and sell, go to the Freeport Rogue's guild, and do
the quests to deliver notes to Janim and Rebby (names probably not
spelled right).  An hour or two of that will get you "amiable" with the
merchants, without hurting any other factions.

Don't get too complacent in Freeport.  There are some NPCs who are
probably KOS to you.  For example, there's a dwarf on the second floor
of the Hogcaller's Inn (or is that Hogtrader's?  Whatever...) who
doesn't like Dark Elves.  He got me outside once.  I don't know if he
rarely takes a stroll through West Freeport, or if he was returning
after chasing someone away.  Anyway, keep on your toes.
