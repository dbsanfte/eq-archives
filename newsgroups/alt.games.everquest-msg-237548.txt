Back when I exp'd in Velks, I would on occasion duo with a paladin
just inside the entrance, off to the right. Every now and then, a tank
(puller) would fall to his death right on top of us. The paladin said
he'd gotten so used to the rain of warriors and rangers that he didn't
even notice them anymore.
