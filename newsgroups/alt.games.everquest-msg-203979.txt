Well i dont know which post to reply to cos theres stuff in all of them.

I've been playing EQ since Feb this year, so I aint an old timer.  But I
too have been sick to death of hearing people whining for KEI on PoK.

My main is a Non-Twink 49 Cleric, i didnt even know what KEI was until
level 25, and when i did find out about it I never /OOCed for it.
Admittedly I'd hang around on PoK and do 30mins of tradeskills or
something but if a group came up I'd just leave and go XP.

In my mind its the soloers who have whined the most about the bug fix...
(no its not a Nerf) because they have been hardest hit.  But do you think
its complete coincidence that the bug fix has been timed to coincide with
the changes to group experience, no, I think not.  Get over it and get a
group so you dont need to use 75% of your mana to get a kill.  And if you
only have 1hr play sessions then just go duo with someone, you can get
going in 10mins.

As for complaints of nerfing grouping... thay havent. They've merely
improved goruping to be on a par with soloing albeit with less danger. But
I'm going off topic now.

So to sum up. Thank you SOE for the bug fix, its certainly made PoK a more
pleasant place.
