Here's an idea: Don't buy the peridots. Tell the tanks that if they
want a symbol, they're going to have to bring their own. I know a LOT
of clerics do that. They carry a stack with them just for certain
situations, but I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect the tanks
to pay their own way for a buff that costs so much money.
