I am sure that is their strategy here. I just hope they are at least 
making some attempt at keeping consistent with what's best for the game 
overall. There are many little annoyances in EQ. Some *should* be fixed 
and some could just use some tweaking. Others should probably be left 
alone, regardless of the number of knuckleheads it might attract to do 
otherwise.

I didn't mean to imply that I'm against their recent attempts at 
improvement. I do enjoy most of them and think they were too long in the 
making. The addition of shared bank slots, just to name one, was awesome. 
I just hope they don't get over-zealous in their efforts.

I think change is good...in moderation.  :)
