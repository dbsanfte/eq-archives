Don't know about the Enchanter, but get yer Druid to Plane of Nightmares, 
and go nuts. I made 56-60 in a weekend. This is no longer quite so easy (
there is a whole other thread about the reasons) but the xp should still 
be the best a Druid can get.

One piece of advice. Since you will be charming, and you will need to 
haste your pets, buy a Sand Eroded Shell... This is a right-click Savage 
Spirit item, and it will save you one spell slot. Don't pay more than 2k 
for it, though.
