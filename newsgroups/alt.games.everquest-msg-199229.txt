You bought the trilogy...no wonder.

get Shadows of Luclin.  you'll see EVERYTHING in a new light.  With luclin
(and the new models), you can choose hair styles and color, facial hair, eye
color and you can buy prismatic dyes (while expensive for a n00b) to change
your clothing color.

way to research the game and give it a chance.

Like I said.  your loss.
