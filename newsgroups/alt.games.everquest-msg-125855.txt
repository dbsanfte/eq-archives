I think it goes up with the levels. On my server (AB) you're cheap if you
offer less then 50pp and more often then not 100pp is offered.

Portguildies of mine make loads of cash by just porting around for an hour
or two. Best so far was 2 blue diamonds for a single person port to CS and
then an evac to WW (5 minutes in total).
