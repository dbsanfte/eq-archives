Fishing has always been profitable, esp for newbies. 
Tailoring is also a good  trade for profit, at least early on, for all classes.
Selling silk swatches and silk threads is very profitable as you only need to
buy a small sewing kit. Spiders and spiderlings supply the rest. :) For the
melee classes there's the added bonus of being able to make your own patchwork
armour. Monks in particular gain much from tailoring as all their armour is
tailored. Having said all that you may find it a little difficult finding
tailors to buy silk swatches as tailoring gets expensive at higher levels when
they're trying to save money for either brewing or smithing.
Of the other trade skills Fletching, Baking and Brewing (provided you can
forage), although not profitable, are good skills for saving money. :)
