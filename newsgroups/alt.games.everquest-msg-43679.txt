I highly reccomend that practice, there are very few uses for your practice
points as a caster anyway.  Your research skill cap goes up five points
each time you level, and you get five "free" practice points...seems like
it was "meant to be"

Froglok eyes drop inside Guk occaisionally, you don't need
froglok tadpole eyes (although that would make sense given
the relative difficulty of mobs that drop the rattles)

Large snake rattles I've seen in Oasis off the asps, I think
also in N Ro off the rattlesnakes... not sure its been so long,
I know some mobs drop "giant" snake rattles and some
"Large"... but can't think which were which.
