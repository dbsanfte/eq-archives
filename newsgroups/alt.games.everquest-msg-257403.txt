i agree - ldon is all about well-shuffled (think cards) mobs...casters
abound

boggle definitely blows

what blur are you talking about?

i use the 49 AE blur and it works very very well

i really like it!

you can see the double "soandso blinks a few times" message for everything,
it's AE, and i have had it resisted/ignored less than probably any other
spell, including harmony (the new one, post-nerf)

try it, you'll like it....the downside is how it's AE, it'll botch aggro for
the mobs that are hitting their correct target...but...better than you
dying, right? =D

uproar is blocked by most STR buffs though, doesn't that annoy you? either
