Okay, I agree with everything above except maxing 2hb. Is there any reason
for a cleric to work on this at all? Is there a 2hb weapon out there that
has such great stats that it is worth giving up both slots for it,
especially considering at 42 you shouldn't be meleeing at all?

I'm not bashing you here, just wondering, as I also have a 42 cleric and
have completely ignored 2hb.

Thanks for any input,
Naphtoe
