Creative snipping does not do away with facts buddy.  I provided you
with an example of past action by the developer which supports the
concept of them not intending for guards to help players gain
experience.  If their intent was other than to prevent such use of
guards the action they took would not have been required, nor taken.  I
noticed you snipped it from your reply earlier and laughed as that is
just what a rule lawyer does, focuses on twisting facts to support his
claims while refusing to acknowledge facts contrary to them. 
Misdirection  is the key, as you well know.  If you can keep folks
focused on your specious points they may not notice the valid
contradictions.  So please do continue to make your prattling insults
rather than points.  I for one find it amusing to watch you dance and
while  I cannot speak for others, to my thinking, an insult from you is
better than a compliment.  Though I have to admit your attempts at
making points are pretty funny too.
