No auto-spellcheck here.  I do NOT use Outlook.  HTML is for webpages.
My outlook (Ha ha) is that if you can't say what you want to say
without plain text, I'm probably not interested in it anyway.

I use Agent for Usenet, and since my needs are simple, for email too.

Just have to remember to hit f7 when you get done typing in a message.
