    I asked Shady Swashbuckler once about carrying metal bits. His eyes went
wide, his wrists twitched uncontrollably, he screamed, and then he accosted
me with a well-balanced scimitar. Apparently even NPCs don't like making
metal bits.

    Several methods of making stuff by the stack without making skilling up
easier have been presented to Yak, hopefully he'll eventually have time and
the desire to implement one.
