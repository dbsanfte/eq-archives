if you are not full mana then have it on, whether in a fight or not.

turn it off when you get down to 1 bubble of health,  whether in a fight or
not. you dont have to, of course, but low health=big taunt. and the mana
cost of recasting is tiny.

when the mob hits you, this spell has a chance to proc one of your low level
lifetaps. (not sure if high dex makes it proc more often).

i didnt really use it, but by all means experiment with it. you should still
be meleeing with mobs to get your defence maxxed.
if it procs on average twice per fight, then it is mana efficient. if it
doesnt , then stick it in page 59 of your spell book and never use it again

throughout your necro career you will be using this spell to keep your
evocation maxxed. whenever you wait for a boat or are /auc in East Commons,
cast a lvl1 pet and cast this spell on him constantly. make sure you kill
the pet before you get on the boat (or you might get left on land as the
boat leaves due to a bug)

i wouldnt bother going to kurns (unless theres a zone Experience Modifier
there) , Najena has a zem and plenty of undead in there. not too sure if
they can be single pulled though. might need a partner or 2.
