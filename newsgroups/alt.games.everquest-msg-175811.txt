Several of us use Xnews, which is the most configurable reader I've ever 
used in Windows.

The feature I like best is the ability to auto-kill crossposts.  
Unfortunately, people think they have to reply to these idiots to show off 
their great store of Wit.  In the process, they "do the right thing" and 
remove the crossposts, so it only goes to the a.g.e newsgroup - causing my 
reader to pick up their stupid-ass replies.  You'd think they would realize 
by now that replying to spam just creates more.

Xnews lets you score the threads and posts and you can make it behave 
differenty to different scores.  Having a grasp of regex really helps for 
this.  When I first started using it, I would kill all the threads that 
were worthless [ about 95% of them after the 3rd reply ], but then the 
reader has to do way too much filtering when you open it.  I still haven't 
figured out a way to do this efficiently.  Maybe ~empty knows.
