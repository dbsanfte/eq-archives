Thats true. I was under the false impression that people would
actually use channels for what they are designed for.

I have already turned off /auctions anyway (The stuff being sold
always seems to be about 100 times more than I can afford anyway, AND
I have spent the last 4 levels asking if anyone has large sized bronze
armour to sell with no luck)

How about changing /auction to allow players to place adverts in the
norath times? or have a catalog of second hand equipment? Maybe
introduce supermarkets, where players could hire a vendor to sell
their gear for them, without needing to clog up East Commonlands?

I played a lot of Ultima Online before EQ. The problem there was that
everyone had to buy a shop. And the whole world became one great
shopping mall. But at least you didn't get upto a thousand players in
one area /auction WTS Uberts widget of +40 to everything 300K or
something.

I have found that if I travel from North Ro to East Commonlands I have
to log out of the game and reboot my PC because the frame rate drops
to 1 or 2 frames per second after I have passed through the tunnel
because of the number of bodies in there.
