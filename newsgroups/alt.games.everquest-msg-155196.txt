    Howdy, Absor! Nice to see you reading a.g.e. :-) Mind you, it wouldn't
be A.G.E. if I didn't attempt a hijack....

    My post is maybe half of the way down - my EZBoard name is "Delores
Mulva", the name of my primary character. I'm not looking for a comment on
this, a "we'll do this" or anything else public. I just want you to read it,
maybe share it with others at the office if you think it warrants it, and
know that I'm going to cancel my account because of the changes coming in
this next patch. One of the members of my guild is a member of the US Navy,
and he made me promise to wait until he gets back from sea October 25th so
he can at least say goodbye properly - but then I go.

    James
