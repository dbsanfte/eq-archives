Actually you are doing the spawn wrong. Their idea is in fact that you
DON'T hang around there for 10 hours with "fuck all" happening. There
idea  is that you do it the way they mean for you to do it, in
passing. The funny thing is this actually works. 

See, the AC is a very rare part of the random spawn roll for that
spot. Ogre, pirate, goblin etc all seem to be equal while the AC is
maybe if 95 to 100 is rolled in a random 0 100. This means that if you
stay for 3 placeholders you are no less or more likely to get the AC
than if you stay for 100. Every time something spawns there its
rolling. If you want to think of it in real world terms, a person is
no more likely to win 20 million in the lottery if they play twice a
week for 12 years as someone is who buys one ticket during the 12
years.

Since figuring this out I have got jboots 3 times, well really there
is nothing to figure out so I should say "since being aware of this." 
One time I was in oot with no one around and killed the placeholders
twice, then the AC spawned (with no one else around still) Another
time I logged out on sister's island and happened to log on right as
the server came up. I was the only person in OOT and the AC was up
as plain as day. A third time was also within a few spawns. The only
times I've gotten the AC was when I was not intending to do so and
just had lucky randoms. I camped the spot for the XP from the "A
cyclops" once for about 2 and a half hours, when bored, and got no AC
that time.

The ac is designed to make Jboots very rare though, so doing that
would make them the way that they used to be. It would be similar to
the way it was when Drez dropped jboots in Najena.

Ahhh.. so you are talking about SRO. Don't even bother trying to get
it to spawn in SRO. Its outrageous luck. As many as 12 people try at
the same time and you still don't see an AC come. Wait until you can
try the spawn in OOT, try to do it casually there instead of "camping"
it for 10 hours (you'll pull your hair out.) What I find good for
camps like OOT is to set a limit ahead of time, " I am going to do
four PH's and if the AC is not one of them I am going to leave." One
hour is more than enough time for the dice to roll in your favor, or
not.

They don't "make" you do anything. In fact this is the precise reason 
why they finally put in Tboots. Ironically you'd be wearing a pair of
tboots right now if you spent the same amount of time killing spiders
for spider silk and selling it in the bazaar. You are not owed a rare
spawn or item by the game, you simply have a chance to aquire it. 
The original designer's intention is that you meander through the area
taking that chance and then move on, rather than sit there for 12
hours (at the oot spawn) Meanwhile, at the sro spawn, their intention
is that many people regularly doing the area at an appropriate level
would eventually cause the AC to spawn and someone high enough who
wandered by or heard about it would kill it. The sro intention does
not work though because no one really does sro.

Things are working as intended, they don't intend everyone
to get jboots.
