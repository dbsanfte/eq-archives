Well, depends on the Vette.  Basically any Vette from 74-82 (no 83
model) was an underpowered piece of shit.  In fact, a new Accord V6
has more HP than those 70s Vettes (200hp vs 190hp).  So, you take a
smaller, lighter, more powerful, and more balanced car and compare it
to something that doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's a penis
substitute, yet some dorks still claim the Vette is a better car.  
The funny thing is that the Accord has never competed with the
Corvette, if anything it's a competitor to the Monte Carlo or whatever
that mid-range piece of vomit is that Chevy sells.  When Honda wants
to compete with the Corvette, they have the NSX or the S2000, both
truly world class sports cars, that just happen to have the same
reliabilaty and relative maintenance costs as the rest of their car
line.  (OK, granted NSXs were tearing through tires, but 270hp in a
3000lb car can do that.)
