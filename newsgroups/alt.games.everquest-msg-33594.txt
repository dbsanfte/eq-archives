How would it be looked upon if on a PvP server your group came and wiped out
the other group (even assuming they were full health/mana)?  Would that be
frowned upon (similar to KSing)?  Or as long as both groups were near same
LV range (or yours was lower) then it would be considered OK?  I've always
thought about this sort of thing on PvP servers.  Especially if you were
rival races (group of Ogres Trolls and Iksars attacks a group of Humans and
other similar races).
