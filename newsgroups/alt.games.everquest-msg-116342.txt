Having finally attained the magical level 14 with my newbie Druid, I was
approached in the Misty Thicket by a Level 13 Cleric.  He ran up to me and
did a /say "SoW Plz?"

My response was to tell him that I didn't understand what he wanted.  He
told me that it was the "Level 14 Druid spell, Spirit of Wolf, could you
just cast the spell, because I am in a hurry."  I suggested to him that I
may understand him better if he said something like, "May I have a Sow
please?"  After ignoring him for a couple of minutes, he went away muttering
something about my being a Jackass.

What is the appropriate response to this type of request?

Kscum; Lvl 14 Druid
Happy to have earned his Cultural Armor in Misty Thicket
