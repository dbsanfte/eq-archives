There is no way to tell. Vendors are not meant to be killed so they
may be green but hit you for 265 damage.

When you kill a vendor, there is no loot, no corpse and no experience
points.. That is to prevent people from killing vendors because it is
purposeless.
I don't think there is even a faction hit but am not positive.

Don't kill vendors, its pointless and play interrupting.
