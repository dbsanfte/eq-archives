All true. I enjoyed the place in my 30s with a cleric.

However you have one more issue, which is getting there. At your level you
can't fight your way through the OOT to the tower, the wandering mobs will
kill you. And there's only the one entrance to the TOFS so be sure and
approach the actual tower from the southeast.

Best advice is what someone else said: add a druid. Druid can port you to
the OOT, and keep everybody safely SOWed for the run to the TOFS, and be the
rooter/snarer both on the way and inside, and help the cleric get back in
there for any rez runs. With a 30s druid I think you could do the 1st and
2nd floors and have a real good time.

And by the way: make sure the cleric collects all the keys (at least the
first key that drops for each floor). So that if things go sour after the
1st floor, the cleric can get back in and up for rezzing. Don't let the
cleric bind anywhere in OOT, it's not safe at lvl 34, the mobs there wander
and will aggro.
