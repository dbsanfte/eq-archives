Sounds like they don't like your credit card number.  Have your parents
enter the information instead...the information must be put in EXACTLY
correct (ALL of it, name, address, expiration date) or else you may get this
weird sequence.

This is just a guess.  I'm thinking that EQ doesn't check your info before
you hit Enter (or OK, or whatever) but by the time you get back to the login
screen the process has finished and you've been rejected.
