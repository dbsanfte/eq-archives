Anyone here know anything about the problems on Bristlebane last night? Came
in at about 2am GMT and server was locked (had left PC's on character
screen) no biggie was only going to log off anyway. Just spoke to someone at
work and he says he's character has lost exp (had just made 16 is now 14
again) was there a roll back of anysort?
Can't really log in at work, tho may have a go at lunchtime now, curiosity
up now.
