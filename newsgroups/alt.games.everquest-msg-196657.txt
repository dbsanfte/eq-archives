I am against anything in the game that is automatically done out of 
preference rather than necessity, yet is not by design. In other words, 
if, when people gear up to hunt, they automatically make it a point to go 
get a KEI fix, the game has been changed outside the developers' intent. 
If it were the developers' intent for people to make getting KEI such a 
priority, they would just up the mana regen rate on everyone. In this 
case, something is obviously broken, either the game or the methods of 
play many people employ. Since people cannot be saved from themselves, I 
say it's the former.
