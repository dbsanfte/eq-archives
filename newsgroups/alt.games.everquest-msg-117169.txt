Where do they drop, and what from?  We're having our first raid
on CT this coming Friday night.

And if anyone has any other suggestions for the best spot/mobs
to kill when we go there, or any good tips on how to prosper
there, I'm all ears.

I know the zone itself like the back of my hand, I spent months
there back before it was upgraded.  But I know very little about
the new mobs and their drops.
