Hm, so you're suggesting that the difference could be which zone the
character is in?  Yes, that's possible.  What zone is the inaccessible
character in, and can other characters go to that zone and still work?
Conversely, can the inaccessible character use the Return Home button
to get to a different zone?

It's also remotely possible that something about the character is
triggering some sort of safety block in the firewall, if the firewall
includes any sort of content checking to protect against viruses or
whatever.  (I remember one company I was at that supplied a Java-based
application, where the application got blocked by one customer's
firewall because one of the Java libraries dealt with something called
"S" expressions, and the Java code therefore included the string "sex".)
