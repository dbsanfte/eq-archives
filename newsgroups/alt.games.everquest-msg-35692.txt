That's not true if you have a heavy weapon like Wurmslayer (15 stone) a
fight will drain sta no matter how high it is, this is the downfall to the
wurmslayer. Once sta is at zero I think you stop swinging and only attack
when sta builds up some like every tick your attacks become very slow. All
haste items and spells become useless and you will no longer double attack.
Invigor is very important if your tanks have heavy weapons, I belive it
actually restores 35 sta per tick for 6 or 7 ticks, for it will completely
restore your sta in most cases.
