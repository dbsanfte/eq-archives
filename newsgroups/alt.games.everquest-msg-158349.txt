Nope.  From what I'm hearing, raid groups not only skip out on the group
bonus (as the patch message said), in addition they take a rather large hit
to the base exp value of the mob.

I forget if it was said that the penalty was 40 or 20 percent *less*
experience than a group of 6 or a soloist would get killing it. (not
counting losing the group exp bonus)... then that total is divided equally
among all the members of the raid.

I haven't done any real research on it though, so this could be wrong.
*shrug*
