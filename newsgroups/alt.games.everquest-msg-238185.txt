I believe the cutoff for such lowbies is level 50.  Any spell past 51
can not be cast on such low players.

As a side note, the reverse situation here is *much* better.  A level
65 Ranger can cast his best (non-group) spells on the Beastlord's pet.
 (Still not on the BL himself of course.)  Pets are fair game for
single target buffs of any level, so most pet classes can be
powerleveled quite well by a Ranger.  (Better yet a Druid, Cleric,
Shaman, BL, etc...)  Of course this just makes the
skills-lagging-behind-the-player's-level problem even worse though.
