Consider an artist who has the talent to write music, has put in the
considerable effort to become proficient in her craft, has committed
to the effort of creating a song, and has jumped through the hoops to
produce and market that song. I can't see anything about that which
gives you, a completely uninvolved third party, the right to a free
copy of it under any circumstances.

If you're morally incapable of understanding how gaining a benefit
from something without the blessing of the person(s) who put in the
effort and expense to produce it is theft, there hardly seems to be
any point in trying to explain it further.

On that I am in agreement with you - however, as you are not the owner
of the material in question, I don't think you are entitled to decide
what avenues the industry should take, nor to take matters into your
own hands merely because you think they are missing the boat.
