does anyone know the truth behind summoning a pet of a decent level?

i heard it was only affected by the caster's conjuration skill - NOT true

i heard it was random - maybe . . .


a necro's level 4 pet spell almost always summons a yellow (lvl 5) pet

enchanter pets 20-40 are all green, but the 44 (sometimes) and 49 (always)
pets are blue

mage pets seem the most consistent, being blue blue blue for a mage's life

(everyone laugh at druid and wizard pets . . . dorks have so much power and
they need pets too? /mock)


so who has research? i'm mega-curious about how random pet summoning is
