Hi all,
I was wondering if it existed a program allowing to save, import 
and export hotkeys configurations... I am quite sure such a prog 
really exists but I can't figure out which one... The one I 
remember could import existing horkey configurations from one 
character to another.

Did I dream during a day or am I right?
