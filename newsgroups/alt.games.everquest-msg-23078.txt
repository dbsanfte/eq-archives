Jump off the spires in DL. Just make sure you have levi, or can get your
corpse easily. My druid was actually *scared* climbing those spires with
levi up lol.
Great place to take a self screenshot for that guild picture.

Some of those peaks in fm can be pretty scary too. Turn back the clip plane
and all you'll see is sky... eek.

Speaking of spires, U can run off the NK spires and over the top of the
tower and onto the bridge for silly things to do.

Freeport is good fun for getting into "illegal" places (up on top of the
walls). In ef, where you zone in from wf, the westernmost zone, with levi
you can just make it to the top of the wall, then yuou can run around onto
the walls and tops of houses. wf is good for this too... theres a place near
the gate where you can get up onto the walls with levi. nf is harder. you
can get into a wall near the grasy area at the north. You have to use a sign
IIRC. Unfortunately, most of the walls are too far away from this wall you
can get onto, so most of nf is just accessible via ground level. There may
be other places, but I dont know them.

Sometime im gonna go there and announce a 100p prize for the first newbie
who finds me. Yes, I know im evil.

kelethin is a good place to have fun with levi. You can get on top of the
bank pretty easily. And you are never locked out of the arena wih levi...
just climb a spire and over the wall. Sitting on top of one of the bird
posts in SK is easy too by just levitating off the main structure. great
tactic for lake rathe with those pesky towers you cant cast harmony on.
