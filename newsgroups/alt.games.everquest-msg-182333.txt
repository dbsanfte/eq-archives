You will eventually get a snare spell, an AoE snare as I recall, that will 
slow down the mobs.  In the meantime, buy Blood of Wolf potions, if you can 
afford to, they will cast Spirit of the Wolf on you which will make you run 
faster.  At your level though, Root and Nuke is a very viable tactic, my 
baby wizard uses it.  The bolt spells can be used from a long distance 
away, giving you plenty of time to root again when root breaks.
