It's my understanding that specialization only gives you a CHANCE to save UP
TO 10% mana on a cast.  I have no idea how accurate my statement is...I do
know that I haven't noticed anything. *shrug*

Once you get Wandering Mind you'll be happier.  Even happier at 51 when you
get TOT, and ...whatever level Scryer's Tresspass is.  Enchanters have to
worry about mana about as often as shaman and necros (not that often) once
they turn 16.  I love caster zones such as Seb and adventures...I RARELY go
OOM because there's almost always something from which to steal mana.  And
when there isn't...chain stun (you should be doing that now anyway :p ) and
never go OOM while saving the day.

And everyone goes OOM during an emergency...it's not an emergency until you
do go OOM so I think that particular point is moot. <g>
