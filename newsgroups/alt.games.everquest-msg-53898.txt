I have a simple rule.  I get cash.  The only 2 exceptions are when I'm
offered something that I actually want (and there are very few such
items), or it's something that I absolutely *know* I'll be able to
sell for at least the cash owed.  (And as I don't know the actual
prices of 90% of the items out there, that's a long shot.)

Oh, second rule.  I *will* get 50% cash in advance.  If I don't, I
don't make the item.  Had a guy show me the cash, but as I told him,
"I don't care what you show me.  Half in advance is the only way I do
business".  I've lost a few full-suit commissions that way.  On the
other hand, some folks understand and simply pay up.  I'm not Anon,
I'm an officer in my guild, and I'd be pretty stupid to try to cheat
someone with all the info showing.

I don't make for free.  For guild members, I charge material costs,
success and failure until the item's done.  However, I will take other
materials I need "in kind", example being making some FP in trade for
stacks of leather backing or Quality pelts.

Interesting.  I've got 59 days on my 40 Paladin (highest character).
And for pretty much the same reason.
