I think you're jumping to conclusions about them not reading it.

}> Sounds like a bad guess to me. *shrug*.
}Why would you say that?

Because it seemed natural to me, on reading your post and the followups, to 
assume the follow-up-ers meant to say, "I can't get you all the way there in 
one shot, but EQW might be a step in the right direction."  None of them said 
that EQW was a complete solution to your problem, just that it might be a 
helpful tool here.  

That's a good way to get solutions to things... Have people suggest things 
that might help, then see how you can lace them all together.  So it's kind 
of counterproductive to lambast people and accuse them of not listening when 
they only provide a partial answer.
