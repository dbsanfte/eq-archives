Never heard of it.  The closest I could think of was "I'm Alive" by Electric
Light Orchestra

I'm alive!
And the world shines for me today.
I'm alive!
Suddenly I am here today.

Suddenly came the dawn (from the night),
Suddenly I was born (into light).
	How can it be real?

I'm alive...


Come to think of it, everyone should have to sing that song everytime a
cleric rezzes them.  =)
