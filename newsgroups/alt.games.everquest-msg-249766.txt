Yesterday on Karana in PoK, there was a short GM event also. A dwarf
roleplaying that he needed drinks for his son's birthday party. 8
Surefall Ranger's Trail Juices got me a 34% haste belt with fairly
nice stats on it, a diamond and 3 other gems.

Maybe it's a sign of other short events that are more than just
'Fishing event in Zona A'. :)
