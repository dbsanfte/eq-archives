I'm being serious here. From what I have seen of you, the style of
socializing in EQ would jar very badly with yours, and you'd be liable
to end up labeled as a troublemaker whether you actually wanted to or
not. Save yourself the game cost and subscription fee.

You asked if you would like EQ and I am giving you the answer: No.
