Are you running the new Luclin models? I get the same type of pause
everytime somebody logs into the zone. I turned off all of the new
models and the pause went away. I am going to try defragging and
deleting the cached texture files. My guess is it has something to do
with textures being fetched from the HDD, or one of the last patches
bugged the grphx engine..

Again this looks like a texture or file glitch of some kind to me. You
could try completely removing the two files it is DL'ing. Maybe they
are not getting overwritten properly. Or since your wife's PC is ok,
get the two files from hers and copy them over to yours.
