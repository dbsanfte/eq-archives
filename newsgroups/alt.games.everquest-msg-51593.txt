You have to register the game with the CD key, so in all likelyhood it would
be useless once you registered it.  But this is the norm for MMOGs.  They
are probably all like that.  I know that EQ, UO, AC are anyway.

However, I recommend not letting that stop you.   The game is fabulous.
Really.

Best Regards
