	Catepillars live a while before becoming a butterfly w/the 
ability to fly.  Its a new ability they gain later in life. 
  There are fish that change gender halfway through their 
lives (all the females are just the older ones, ehhe.  Or 
maybe its the males that are the older ones, I don't 
remember).  Wouldn't that make an interesting mmo character 
and a nice suprise to newbies who didn't realize this would 
happen down the road when they made their character, hehe.

	Could also think of it this way.  These mmo's incorrectly 
call what could only be species selection - racial 
selection.  Its a fantasy world of course, maybe trolls and 
humans and dwarves can all interbreed and they are just 
different races of the same species.  But think of them as 
species selections instead, not racial.  Then think of these 
additional attributes as racial selections, you are still a 
part of the same species, you're still a troll who can mate 
w/any lady troll, you just happen to be a different kind of 
troll who is now reaching an age where the differences are 
starting to develop more.  For some unknown reason these 
racial differences in these species don't show up until 
later in life in the eq2 world, but hey, why not.

	It may seem a little silly to be able to select your race, 
but its no more silly than being able to select your 
species.  Can't do either in real life. So if ya wanna be 
realistic in that sense, everyone should just have to play 
w/a randomly rolled character and make the best out of what 
they happen to get, now wouldn't that be interesting.  Would 
be a fun idea for a server to be setup that way, every paid 
account gets 1 character only on this server and one reroll 
at character creation, otherwise they are stuck and must 
play the role fate had them born to.  Instead of a whole 
server of ideally specced characters, you'd have just the 
opposite, would be fun as a second character to whatever 
your main is on some other server, and for me I'd be tempted 
to make it my main.  But then again, maybe it'd be so 
unpopular that the server would be empty. hehe
