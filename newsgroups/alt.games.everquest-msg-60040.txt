  OK... So the gist is that at the moment I can't play EQ on Linux. At the
moment being the opperative phase. Thats fine by me, I need to learn more
about it (Linux that is).
  I did look at Transgaming and there were several people that thought they
should pick up the pace and seemed to think DX8 would more or less fix the
issue.

Now.... on a different but similar topic as far as Linux being bad at
graphics...

  I could be (and probably am) making vague and untrue assumptions on this
one but read it and let me know. Linux is based on Unix right? I mean that
was the point of it... A free version of Unix that worked.
  Now, as I recall Mac OSX is based on Unix. From what I remeber it's not a
vague resemblance either when you get past all the bells and whistles.
(Anyone see where I'm going with this?)
  Mac are supposed to be THE graphics machine, I can't really understand why
though. I can't ever get the damn things to work right half the time.
  Soooo.... If Macs do Graphics on a Unix version, it seems to me that Linux
does graphics as well. At least it could. Right???
