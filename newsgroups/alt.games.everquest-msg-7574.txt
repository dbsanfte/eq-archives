Those extra two slots really make a big difference, I guess, when it's a
bank full of them. I tend to blow through stuff as soon as I gather it,
through selling or using it in tradeskill or just plain giving it away, so I
guess it never really struck me as that big a deal.

I could see it if there were some in-game benefit that Tailoring had above
other trade skills. I don't see one, but maybe I'm missing something due to
my non-packrat playing style.
