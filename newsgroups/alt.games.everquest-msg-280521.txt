Contrary to the observations of some non-trackers, Hill Giants are in Rathe 
Mountains, in full force.  They center about an orc tent on a plateau in the 
north east area of the zone.  Killing the same old placeholders - liazards,

That incident with the inability to cast, having to log out and rememorize 
the gem set apparently was game wide.  It affected us on Bristlebane also.
