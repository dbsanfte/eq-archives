I know how to auction items, but there is something that has driven me crazy
that i just can;t figure out.

I can figure out how to make a 1 line auction hot-button.  But i see people
who have very long lines with multiple items for sale, and i can not figure
out how to hot-button this.  Is there any way to use a hot-button to extend
the length of the message using multiple hot-button lines?

I hoep this makes sense.
Thanks
Dave
