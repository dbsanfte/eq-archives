I just looked on Sony's web site to see what graphics cards had issues with
EverQuest and it looks like most cards are listed as NO KNOWN ISSUES -- yet
there are lots of issues with these cards, including my ATI Rage Fury Pro
that must have sky disabled or go into an epeliptic fit!

What kind of lame ass support is going on here???

If I buy a $150 G3-ti200 from Best Buy, what kind of tweaking will I need to
do?
