>> Yes. And is making files available via the patch server not electronic
distribution? <<

You missed the point this time, probably intentionally. Let me help you:

 "Umm. Yes, it is.  The copyrights owned by the manufacturer also allow them
to control the distribution.  That is, {{it is solely at the discretion of
the manufacturer whether to allow electronic distribution}} - not the
subscriber or licensee."

The patch files are distributed by the manufacturer, correct? They do it at
their discretion. If you distribute any files, no matter how, the
manufacturer can not control the distribution. So the correct answer is no,
you can not legally send the files electronically. Verant can, you can't.
