[Note: I'm not nearly as perverse as this is going to make me sound.  Blame
www.somethingawful.com.  After reading the Hentai game reviews there, I
started wondering if there was anything like Hentai, but aimed at girls.
That led to Yaoi, which is anime-style drawings featuring males, usually
well-known anime males.  That led to all the marvelously weird stuff I'm
going to say below.]

[Note2: my god, some of those Hentai games are *awful*!  Go read the review
of "Water Closet".  They are not making that up...it is a real game,
although you will have trouble believing it]

[Note3: while at somethingawful, go to the Photoshop Phridays section, and
go find the one where people redid the covers to famous children's book.
You'll die laughing at some of those]

I don't think Mystere wrote any slash fiction.  Slash fiction involves
male/male romance or sex.  It's usually written by women, and usually leans
toward the romantic angle.  The genre started with stories of Kirk and
Spock, which were called K/S stories, and that slash became the generic
name.

Pretty much any popular TV show generates slash fiction.  Hercules/Iolus,
from Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, is popular.  Duncan/Methos, from
Highlander, is popular.  There's even Dr. Quest/Race Bannon slash.  Star
Trek has not been forgotton, either: Chakotay/Paris and Paris/Kim are
popular pairings.

This page has a lot of links:

    http://members.aol.com/ksnicholas/fanfic/slash.html

In particular, it's got a nice set of alphabetical links to slash fiction by
specific show or character.  I can just see in my mind Patty and Selma from
The Simpsons spending an evening in front of the computer reading MacGyver
slash....*shudder*.

Unfortunately, a lot of the links are dead.  Too bad.  I'm actually curious
what "Queer as Folk" slash would be like.  Brian/Michael, perhaps?

Oh, this is amusing: http://www.moonrainstar.com/play/quizzes/fotrpairing/
Answer the questions about what you want to see in a relationship, and it
will give you a Fellowship of the Ring slash pairing.  (It came up with
Frodo/Samwise for me).

Anyway, for EQ slash we'd need a couple of prominent EQ males.  Hmmm...how
about Guard Cheslin and Fippy Darkpaw?  Not only get the slash crowd
involved, but get the furries excited, too.  (If you don't know what a furry
is, don't ask.  They make the slash people seem normal).
