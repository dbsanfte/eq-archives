	"Free will" only means that man can choose to ignore the pain caused by
the absence of god's presence.  It does not mean that man can contravene god's
plan.

|degrade God's work ... and he does it every chance he gets.

	This version of Satan is modern (relatively speaking).  Even in
Revelations, Satan is just another of god's creations doing his job.  The
entire notion of an angelic rebellion and, in fact, the name Lucifer being
applied to Satan came along only a few centuries ago.  (Lucifer, in the Bible,
is a name used to refer to Nebuchadnezzar.)

	I, of course, am an atheist, but if you're going to use religious
fundamentalism as an argument, do it right.
