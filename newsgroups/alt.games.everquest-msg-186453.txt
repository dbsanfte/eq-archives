   Just wondering If I should go to Direct X 9 My system is a Dell
Dimension Desktop at 1.6ghrz  256megs of ram and a 128 ultra rage ATI
16mb Video Card. Next month I am putting in a 128bit Video card and
upgrading the Ram Maybe. Depending I am sort of in the situatuon where
I only have the cash to get A New video Card or More Ram.  If I
upgrade to Direct X 9 now will I see any Noticible improvments in
Everquest in the way my system is right now. With my Pentium 4.
Any suggestions would be appreciated
