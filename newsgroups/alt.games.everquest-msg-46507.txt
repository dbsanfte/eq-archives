Doesn't quite work that way.
There's 13 named mobs after Ikitar and Esharn.
Exclude Vulak for now, since he's an odd ball in that he has 24
entries on his drop table.

From the 12 remaining, each has on average about 2 "good" items.  The
rest are weak.

For example, Sevelak and Cekenar have 8 items combined in their drop
table.  Of the 8, almost every one of them is either situational use
or junk (10/21 1HS anyone?).

The only "exceptions" are Jorl and Zlexak--both have pretty decent
items for the most part (Jorl has the Facemasher which is junk).

As for "godly", I mean items where there isn't a better alternative
which can be obtained with equal or less effort.
