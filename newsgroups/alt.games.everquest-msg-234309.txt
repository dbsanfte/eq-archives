I haven't been reading this whole thread since I'm just
not that computer literate (I can do what I need to do
but if something strange happens, I yell for someone who
does know what's going on.) But...one thing I learned
early was that if Internet Explorer is in 'Work Offline'
mode, EQ will not establish a connection.

This may be something that falls in the category of 'Well,
everyone knows THAT!' so no one has mentioned it, but
thought I would throw it out there anyway.
