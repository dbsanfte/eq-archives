Hey Tom. Stop being a moron and quit the crossposting. If you must answer
ETP do it in your "home" NG. If you hadnt noticed alot of people do not
answer him because they have him killfiled you twit. Doesnt it seem odd to
you that he doesnt respond? That is because he is automated.  Get it? Good.

You're very sad. Rush, Jethro Tull, Iron Maiden and all the other shit. It's
alright for you, Dead Bollocks, because you'd be dead. The rest of us poor
bastards would have to listen to that garbage.

If you want to show homage to some black rap artists, I suggest you go out
and shoot a couple of teenage girls at a party. Seems to be the current
trend from that musical direction.

"Christian songs"??? BWAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!

Who d'you think you are, Harry fucking Seacombe?

Oh, and you should never mention the words "music" and Public Enemy" in the
same post. It's a bit like putting "Michael Barrymore" and "swimming
lessons" together.

Get a grip, preferably before you die, soft lad.

As I said previously, one of my goals would be to create a musical document
that would be here after I am gone in 3.46 years composed of music from the
past so that you would have something else to help guide you.

The main features of the music included will be this

1)Music with lyrics that seem to have some bearing on these end times some
of which were written as many as 30-35 years ago. BOC, Rush, Jethro Tull,
Iron Maiden, Queen, Marillion, etc.

2)An attempt to show homage to black rap artists to give them the respect
they deserve, especially the ones with a more negative, creative, rebellious
attitude. Ice-T, Public Enemy, L.L. Cool J, Mr. Snoop Doggy Dogg, DMX, etc.

3)Will probably mix in some classic Christian songs eventually as that is
the most rebellious thing you can possibly do right now.

Here is the link to the station, it's really rough right now but I suppose I
have 3.46 years to complete it.

I'll be adding some Public Enemy tracks today and posting the lyrics for the
ones I like on here and posting the lyrics for every song I add, it may take
a while as I don't know much about Public Enemy, God seems to have led my
mind in that direction.

About 6 months before the end I will put them in order and create kind of a
countdown of the 500 best ones or something as I like to do.
