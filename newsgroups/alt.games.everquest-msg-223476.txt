I am offended that you use the words Civil Disobedience. This is a
freaking game, this isn't a social injustice. If you want something to
protest, how about you read the Human Stain? There is a real social
injustice.

Back to EQ:

So what is the point? They are fixing in, so why a protest? I mean
really, what is the point? This is somehow going to influence the
management? I know warriors are not balanced, I agree with that, but
if you KNOW the fix is coming, why bother, and have all the unintended
consequences. You are about to screw the rest of us, especially if we
need a GM at that time.

No GM in his right mind would /join
serverwide.bitch_moan_and:complain. It is too easy for them to see the
petition and let it sit on the queue. I guarantee you will clog up an
already broken system with these your precanned petitions. Sit in the
PoK for all I care, but dont screw the rest of us who are trying to
play our own characters, with their own flaws and drawbacks.

We still have people concentrated into a few zones, some places have
low ZEM and some have astronomical ones.

The PoK has make faction an annoyance instaed of a storyline. 

Quests are in need of revamping. 

Customer service is at an all time low. 

Your protest wont mean a woot to any of these, and wont influence SOE
in the least.

I am sure people can bitch about a lot of issues that are global to
everyone. Try taking a boat across OOT when you are an evil. You get
as far as Sister Island now with the translocators. Most everyone has
PoK so it isn't a problem.

A rising tide lifts all boats, and that includes warriors. We need a
lot of quality fixes in EQ, not just for warriors. When that happens,
I tell you now, expect another fee increase, one I will happily pay.
