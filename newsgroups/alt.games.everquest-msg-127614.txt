I encountered this one time in Paludal caverns one time.  I assumed it was a
bug.  I was running back to zone line when all of a sudden I start getting
attacked by two recondite something-or-others from behind I assumed, so I
turn around to target whoever it was (I was level 28 by that point, so no
biggie, I could solo two of them down) and lo and behold, nothing there,
nothing showed up in my target window even though they had dealt damage to
me.  I tried FD a couple times, but the skill was still low at the time
(fixed this since then) and then had to run to zone.  Got griped at later
cause I had trained someone (I gave warning, but he logged on just after I
had given the warning and immediately got trained).  I apologized and tried
to explain what had happened, he just stayed bitchy and called me a noob.  I
laughed and logged off.  Useless to argue with a fool.  Anyway, all that to
say, you probably just experienced a bug of the game.  Glad to hear there
was a 60 cleric there.  Talk about good luck.
