I don't know how grouping works in EQ2.

One thing you have to understand about WoW is there is not an xp grind.
In most games I know (EQ/DAOC) you form groups to kill the same MOBs
1000 times in a row.  This does not happen in WoW so there are not xp
grind groups.  (I will say you can do it and one good reason to do it
is to farm something like hides. However, generally you're better off
moving to an instanced dungeon or finding some quests.)

You must for balanced groups in WoW to do the instanced dungeons.  This
is good xp and the best loot.  When I see someone broadcast looking for
a group, it's usually for a particular instanced dungeon.

The other type of group is quest groups.  These are often temporary
groups and usually don't need to be balanced, anywhere from 10 minutes
to a couple hours to work out some quests.  Some quests are too hard to
do solo.  Some quests are easier grouped. Some quests are harder
grouped.  So it's really not a you must group kind of game, because you
can just skip or delay quests you can't solo, but I think you need to
at least group up occasionally to get the most out of it.

So even though WoW doesn't force you to group, for a lot people it's
just more fun to group especially if it's with RL friends or
guildmates.  WoW does have one nice feature called "share a quests"
which allows you to give a quest to another player *if* they meet all
the requirements for the quest (so really you are just saving them from
having to track down the quest-giver NPC...but it is a huge time saver
in quest groups.)
