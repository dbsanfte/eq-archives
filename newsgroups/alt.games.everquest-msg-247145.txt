Nice, Richard!

I'm enjoying my Controller so far.  I took my first one to level 7 then
restarted her and took a different power set because I didn't like how she
was developing.

If any of you guys want someone to group with that's around level 6, give me
a ring.  I have a friend who is playing a defender and a tanker so if he's
on, we'll have an ever-so-rare meatshield.
