This bug happens occaisionally all over, I first saw it in Eastern Wastes
shortly after velious release, but have seen it in lots of zones in the years
since.

Logging out and back in or zoning often cures it, occaisionally a zone repop is
needed.  I've also seen the bug reported world wide.  Used to be you could get
GM's to customer service rez you and such when something like this happened,
GMs are so hard to get these days that you should probably bet on handling the
rez yourself rather than wait and hope and possibly go over time.
