Great, I'm glad to have someone with real experience help out on this.

I thought that despite their combination of race and class might mean 
some characters would have both the sneak and the hide skills, only 
rogues could combine them so as to allow movement and that total "you 
can't see me" effect.  Doesn't moving, even while successfully sneaking, 
break hide if you aren't a rogue?

I also had the impression that skill level didn't matter insofar as what 
you can sneak/hide from, but rather simply with how hard it is to get 
each skill working (failure rate).  I know I've started a couple 
halfling rogues simply in order to drag bodies out of some relatively 
scary places back in the days before guild lobby corpse summoning...and 
by low level, I mean level one, since they weren't ever going to fight 
anything, I could roll them up, then just walk (ever so slowly) to 
whereever the body was and drag it to where the CR would be easy.

The other ability rogues have vis a vis these skills is that they get a 
success/fail message, while everyone else has to use the old "con 
something that isn't nuetral, and try again till it changes" method.

Yeah, thats what I was referring to with "At high levels, this
 >>ability becomes astonishing," trying to keep the writeup down to as 
short as possible while covering the basics.  I mean, yes, technically 
highlevel rogues don't get this ability, only rogues who buy that AA 
do... but its got to be pretty high on the "hit parade"

Speaking of which, I've noticed that high level rogues don't seem to be 
slowed down at all while doing their hide/sneak thing.  Is that another 
AA or is it a consequence of raising the sneak skill, or just level, or 
am I maybe hallucinating and thats not actually true at all?

If you look a bit further down I do mention " working with feats

large I have the impression this isn't something rogues spend a lot of 
time settling for.

Really?  I had the (obviously mistaken) impression that it took you down 
to below everyone else that was on the list, until you attacked again, 
then restored you to your original aggro level.  Instead you're 
suggesting it just reduces your aggro temporarily by some set (or maybe 
even random) amount, something like Jolt?

I remember duo-ing with my cleric and a rogue, he was main tanking, and 
I was playing melee cleric while healing him from the other side of the 
mob.  Whenever backstab would pop up, he'd evade, the mob would turn to 
hit me, and he'd backstab it and it would turn right around again to 
smack him for it.  I can't imagine my cleric was really producing a 
whole lot of hate (despite my best efforts, he could never melee half as 
well as even a warrior, and of course no Taunt)

Now thats a whole other ball of wax; I really need to include this fact 
as its very different from the whole hide/sneak and evade angles.  I 
assume its on a fairly long timer, as I haven't seen rogues using this 
like monks and necroes use FD?

Well, by "undetectable" I meant by the party; there's no "Bilbo just 
looted the One Ring" message.  By including this paragraph, I wasn't so 
much trying to tell rogues about pickpocketing (which as far as I can 
see is mostly a millstone around the neck of the class) but rather to 
educate the rest of the public about it, hopefully suggesting that it 
isn't a big deal and they shouldn't refuse to invite rogues into their 
parties because of it.  I toyed with just leaving it out entirely but 
figured that there are sufficient rumors about it that putting it in 
might save some trouble rather than create some.

As I recall, at low levels a rogue can get some milage by playing "main 
tank" in a group, and using his pickpocket skills as a sort of 
pseudo-taunt to help irritate the mob and keep its attention.
