Cultural armor seems like a joke, by and large, for ages none of
it was worth a plugged nickle, then they added new layers while
dramatically increasing the difficulty of learning the skill... so that
if you happen to have more money than a God you can afford some
gear good enough to take you to the places where you can earn
more money than a God.

I'm irritated to find that some dwarven women don't have beards.  What
are they doing, trying to fit in as Gnomes?  Maybe they should wear flats,
too.

You take damage almost as well as a warrior, and you get aggro much
faster.  Getting aggro and taking the damage is, in fact, your main function
in life.  A ranger can get aggro faster...and die.  When a warrior MA dies,
though, I don't want a warrior SA, I want a paladin or a SK.  Why? Because
the warrior is going to take forever to get aggro, and people are dying right
and left while he tries.  SK or paladin grab it hard and fast.  THen maybe
if its a really powerful mob a warrior can take the time to get it back... but
usually its better to let the paladin/SK keep aggro and suffer with the less
efficient healing it takes to let him tank it out.

Your buffs are only useless with a cleric in your group.  Clerics are not
a necessary component of groups, despite how much some people make
them out to be.  Admittedly in raid situations they are certainly going to
be there, overwriting your buffs.  Luckily at raid levels you do get at least
one buff of your own, BMB.  And clerics get their buffs overwritten too,
by other clerics.  Only one cleric per raid is really going to be buffing,
unless they all happen to be same level range, in which case still only
one cleric is going to buff each person, they will only split the load out.

Clerics are broken because of CHeal, and particularly because CHeal
comes at such a low level.  If this was the Apex heal, coming at 58 or
60, it would make sense.  As it stands, though, by the time it becomes
interesting (MA over 3K hp) all clerics, even ones significantly lower
level than you, have CHeal available.  THis screws up everything.  Normally
you'd see cleric, shaman, druid, paladin, ranger as a nice clean descending line

in terms of healing efficiency and effectiveness.  But as it stands, a lousy
39 cleric is pretty much the best healer in the game, and this has screwed
things
up so badly that they are now giving comperable heals to druids and shaman
in an effort to rebalance.  This then reveals how crappy clerics are compared
to those two classes, so they upgrade clerics...into paladin territory.  Now
the domino theory demands that they do SOMETHING to upgrade paladins...
which will step on the warrior's toes, who then upgrade into... what?

Grabbing aggro quick and then living.  Its not much, but thats your claim
to fame.  You also are probably the best stunners in the game, and arguably
the best group healers, not that others don't have those spell lines, maybe
better than you... but they are busy doing other things, and don't have the
time, mana, or spell slots to keep those up.  Oh, and can we talk LOH?
Life Saver.  Paladins aren't great healers in a grind, but when the chips
hit the fan, its sure handy to have one there to turn wipe into victory.

WIzards were for a long time the worst class in the game.  Have they been
fixed, or is it just that people figured out how to use what they had available
better?

I'd sooner have a warrior and a paladin in a group or raid than a warrior and
another warrior.  Sooner by a long shot.  If there's a class out there with
reason to complain, its warriors, they are almost as bad at doing damage
as a paladin, their only claim to fame is the ability to Take damage, but
you only really need one to do that, its better to have the other plate melee
classes as your backups.

Despite the recent changes to cleric melee capability, they aren't going
to take over the MA, SA, or even TA slots.  This is because they
are premier healers... so even if they absorbed damage as well
as melee classes, you wouldn't want them doing it because they are
needed as the healers!  They don't absorb damage anywhere near
that well anyway.  MA, SA, and TA aren't there to do damage,
so even if clerics do as much damage as those classes did, you
woulnd't replace them with clerics because thats not the point!  Likewise,
they aren't going to replace rangers, rogues, or monks as damage dealers;
their damage output Might be better than yours (jury is still way way out
on that) but its not serious like a damage dealing class.  All they do,
and frankly all you do if your not actively sponging, is add some free
extra damage in to speed things along.  Perhaps its no longer a joke
amount... but its not putting your job in jeopardy.

Here, if you want to complain, look at rangers, rogues, monks, all
melee classes which can be used in nearly unlimited numbers.  These
classes "scale" while warriors, paladins, SK... and yes, even clerics,
do not.  Clerics certainly are useful in larger numbers than are
the other plate classes... but the more you have the less useful each
new one is.  Adding some damage capability extends that out a bit,
but its still far from flattening out that downward slope.
