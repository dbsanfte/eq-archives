On the face of it, it sounds like your account was hacked, and all
your stuff moved to another char.  A chararcter shouldn't rot after
only 4 days offline, if it's level 6 onwards.
The only glitch was having a guessable password.
Your station name is the default EQ chat room handle (unless you
change it) and could have been seen there if you ever went into one.
