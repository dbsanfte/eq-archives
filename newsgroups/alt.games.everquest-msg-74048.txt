Yikes.  DoT's have gotten my druid in trouble way to much in groups.
For my druid, the best thing I can do in a group is Damage Shield,
backup healing, snaring, and MAYBE a nuke to two to end a fight.

DoT's suck because the keep reminding mobs that they don't like you
every 3 seconds.

Now I dunno about this.  My enchanter sees a appreciable amount of
damage reduction with his crappy little level 12 slow spell.  I don't
see how slowing can EVER be a bad thing.

Granted, I've never played a shammy to any appreciable level.
