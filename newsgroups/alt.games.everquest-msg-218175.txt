I do not particularily like the word 'blame' either. My view is that of
responsibility - who has the most responsibility for the action having
accurred givent hat the single most responsible person is no longer around.
In something like a suicide I do not think this questioned should be asked
either as a matter of course either, until someone starts pointing fingers
that is.

Given the level of responsibility a parent has in the raising of children I
think they should be smacked down with a 3 week old trout repeatedly the
minute they start pointing the fingers at others.

I do see you point now - an error of judgement does not lie specifically in
the outcome of the "genetic lottery" unless the parent has known the deck
was stacked against them and continued regardless. Eviroment-wise I think is
much more clear cut, a parent would normally have a very good idea about
what enviroment they are bringing kids into and I do beleive grave errors in
judgement are made by parents all the time in this regard.
