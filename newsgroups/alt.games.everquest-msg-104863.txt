Could be a lot of things. Wrong items, wrong npc, bad faction, broken quest.

If the quest giver talks to you from a hail and you can get the quest

require at least amiable faction to get the armor molds there.

If you need faction kill shadowed men and turn in derv rings to the named
orc Ortallis in South Ro.
