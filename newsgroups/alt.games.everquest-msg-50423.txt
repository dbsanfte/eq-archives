Antiques are only valuable to a collector. Very hard to get an actual hard
value out of it. One mans trash is another mans treasure. LOL Personally I
am a realist and to me antiques really have no actual value. I will sell you
old stuff at inflated prices if you want to buy it though. That kind of
thinking makes for a very fragile economy that is just asking to crash when
reality catches up to it.
