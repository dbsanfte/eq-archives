Xekl's tailoring guide has the distinction of being the first formal
guide on the net. The Everquest community and sites back then were not
well known, unfortunately, so I didn't know about his until well after
I'd put together similar information myself. Had I found his first, I
most likely would never have set out to make my own.

Xekl used to post here, under his (presumably) real name. When I first
announced my guide here, he responded with several complaints about
the information in it, and put forward his own guide as more complete.
But what he didn't mention anywhere in the exchange was that he was in
fact the author of Xekl's Guide. Lack of full disclosure is kind of
poor form, but being a kinder, gentler Lokari back then I didn't make
an issue of it. 

From that and other comments he made later under the Xekl screen name,
I have the distinct impression that he viewed me (and others) as
competition, and wasn't happy about it. I never looked at it that way
- I figured more information on more sites was a Good Thing.

Unfortunately, Xekl stopped updating his guide ages ago, and from all
appearances has left the EQ community. But as long as the community
exists, he'll be rightly known as the first author of an on-line
tailoring guide.
