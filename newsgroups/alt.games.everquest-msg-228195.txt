As long as he didnt advertise it as ornate, the person the vic did
have opportunity to read what it was, if it was on a vendor no one
made them buy it, it wasnt an OOC where maybe it could have been typed
out and the person thoguht the ornate wasnt typed.. 

It kinda makes me think the vic is pretty dumb, but the fact that your
guild is proud of it is also dumb. Personally Id keep very quiet that
a) I was stupid enough to put such a high price on something so common
and b) that someone else was even more stupid enough to buy it.
