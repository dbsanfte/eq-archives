Confirmed on both of those.  A little while ago a group of us were
introducing a friend to LDoN, and after an adventure we used the
magus to move to a different camp, except it wouldn't work for the
friend.  When we told her to confirm she was still carrying the
stone, she realized that she didn't actually have one; she'd done the
stone quest with a different character.  So, she'd been able to
do the adventure without it, but not use the magus.
