I'm going on the assumption that True Newbies (tm) would be too
busy learning the game and their immediate surroundings to cross
the world frequently.

And, if they're True Newbies (tm), they should be encouraged to
take the long way, which will fill them with awe and wonder and
memories they can cherish forever.

The portal books are fine for experienced players.  I don't think
True Newbies (tm) should have been given such easy access to them.
