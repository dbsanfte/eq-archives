That's very weird. And that's my professional opinion :)

The only thing I can think that might cause it is if your system clock
flaked out for some reason. The timestamps are local to your machine,
and the logging we see as users is all client-side, so receiving
messages from the server out of order shouldn't cause this, IMO.

If it's just an isolated case, you could just edit the file to arrange
things correctly. If it's happening a lot, though, you might take a
look at your system clock to see if it's ok.
