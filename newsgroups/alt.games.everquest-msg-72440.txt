	Swiftwind is not that difficult these days.  Any mid-size guild should be
able to get it for any of their Rangers who wants it bad enough to pull the
all-nighter at VSR.

	Earthcaller is another story.  It took me five months of signing up for
every Hate raid I could, raiding 2-5 times per week, before the emerald
dropped.  Some Rangers I know did twice that work and came up empty.  I've
heard that the drop rate varies wildly from server to server, but at least on
E'ci, trying to get an emerald can be a nightmare.  The Druid epic is much
easier, now that they have the triggered tadpole.

	Based on my guild's experiences, I'd have to say the Shaman epic is easier
too.  Getting the tear is a pain, but it DOES drop every time the golems
spawn.  The Monk epic hasn't seemed all that tough, either.  The other
classes, I agree, are pretty much screwed, either by insane drop rules (dragon
items in Bard, Warrior and Paladin quests), insane chokepoints (Clerics,
Wizards) or insane difficulty (Magicians, Bards).

	With my current equipment
(http://interealms.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=10960) My average DPS, melee,
unhasted, is around 45.  I want a Dark Cloak of the Sky soooooo bad....;-)  If
I'm fearkiting that number will go up a good bit since the mob doesn't get to
parry/dodge/riposte nearly so much.
