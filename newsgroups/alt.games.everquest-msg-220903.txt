Only time I've ever invoked the play-nice-policy was with a 2 boxer
doing the same thing to Jade Reavers in CoM. Not sure how long he was
there but after my 4th trip there when the same person called the camp
I just told him he was gonna share it for a while. 

Not sure why a plat farmer would want to hold scarabs in Seb though.
You can pull maybe 1k an hour out of that camp, is that really worth
it for farming plat?
