    Well, no.  I'm proving that I have different priorities when I play. 
Just because I am not a power gamer and got tired of the grind in no way
means that I have more "mentality" than anyone else.  However, I did play
for four years, and had a lot of fun doing so.  I still think that EQ is a
great game.  It's just one that I got tired of.
