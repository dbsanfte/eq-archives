The internet is not a LAN; by its very nature the connection is
intermittent.  Do you know how many machines (routers) the average
packet must transit to reach your computer?  Do you know how much
traffic these routers are handling at any given moment?  Do you
know many things can and do go haywire with this arrangement?
LOTS!  Lookup tables get munged, cables get accidentally severed,
hardware get pulled for maintenance by service providers when they
think the time is convenient, (just when you've finally gotten your
group together to camp the whatsit), some business dumps a huge load
of data through a portion of the route you are currently using, etc.
The list goes on and on.  Consider it a minor miracle when EQ works
as designed and learn to endure the frustration when it doesn't.

When they screw up game mechanics or foist a badly tested patch on
us, then yes we know where to aim our criticism, but Sony can't control
the internet.  FWIW, since the last series of patches, I almost never
go LD and I play 6-8 hours per night.  Sorry to hear of *your* troubles.

PS:  You don't lose your characters when you quit.  If you sign up
again using the same account name and password you can log in to your
old server and find your characters still there.
