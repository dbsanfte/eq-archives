http://makeashorterlink.com/?U36F323F7 is the posting I was refering to.
Zeralenn did some testing a while ago that is listed in her Economical

personal advice when it comes to tradeskilling is make whatever is easiest
to get the parts for and start with combines that trivial closest to your
current skill level, if you have choices.
