Oh, you mean *later* later.  I thought you meant like "about an hour 
later...". :)  That I can relate to.  One day I'll find the name of the 
first high-level necro & his pet that I saw...  *twitch*  They managed 
to do it again soon after I got Luclin, too - I was playing in DSP for 
the first time, we were pulling to one of the zone lines, and I turn 
around and see a spectre behind me.  There is nothing like the feeling 
of your heart completely ceasing to function for a good 3 seconds.
