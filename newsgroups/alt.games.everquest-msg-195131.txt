  It does work, but they don't "open the gate" by
turning on the login server until all of the servers
are ready to go.  And if anyone thinks that's a bad
way to handle it, try to imagine if they opened up
servers one by one.  Everyone looking for their fix
would pile into whatever server is available, regardless
if they have characters there or not.  Disaster.
