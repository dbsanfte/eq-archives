From the shadows, the mysterious kaev <gaston@nospam.yuck.net> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>I just checked Kaev's gear, and it appears that the Froggies have

>pieces of Brellium (non-imbued Dwarven), Full Mithril (non-imbued
>High Elven), Fine Heraldic (non-imbued Human), and Luminant
>Heraldic (Mith. Marr imbued Human) Plate, all of which list FRG
>as an allowed race (sorry, ain't got no DE Plate so I can't check
>that one).

>Looks like Monual just got himself a big new market, hope he's

>Kaev <--- who probably won't be able to resist the temptation to
