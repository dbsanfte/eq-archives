Do you retract any statements you may have made accidentally in the past
stating that you might need more than 20% mana on a pull, that you might
need less, so on and so forth?

You get stuck on such arbitrary things...  Have you heard the phrase "can't
see the forest for the trees?" Please step out from behind the oak.

Your willingness to pull is dependent on what I pull at?  Not based on your
own cleric's mana?

I give up.  You're so far out in left field with manipulating every aspect
of your little scenario until you're "playing just like me".  I reiterate
for the chronically slow, if you're playing just like me, I'm not telling
you to play different.  :P
