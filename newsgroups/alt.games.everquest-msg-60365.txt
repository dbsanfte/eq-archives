This was posted on the Official Boards. I don't run XP so I cannot verify.
Last sentences are the key:

While trying to play EQ on WinXP, You may come across some issues patching
through the patch server, or logging in, when logged into windows as a USER.
This means that the permissions of Admin aren't applied to the user account,
and while patching you'll receive an error that ACCESS IS DENIED. The reason
why this occurs, is that you aren't holding ADMIN PERMISSIONS, and you won't
be able to write over files, that an ADMIN has ran. For example if a person
who has admin permissions had installed EQ. The user account can't run the
patch, because the patch overwrites files, and USER PERMISSIONS can't
overwrite those files, giving you the associated error message, ACCESS
DENIED.

The way around this problem would be by INSTALLING EVERQUEST as USER. That
way everyone has persmissions, because the ADMIN permissions exceed user
permission, so in this case EVERYONE will have rights. Therefore all users
can play the game.

So in short. Install EQ as a plain user. Not as an ADMIN. If you install as
an ADMIN, make sure that you LOG into WinXP as an ADMIN in order to play EQ.
Thank you."
