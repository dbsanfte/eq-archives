This is a rather old request which people have made of verant a lot.
In fact, I believe they even at one time mentioned the possibilty of a
bank "credit" or something (or maybe a player did. A simple 500 and
1000 credit would be nice, that was stackable (with those of their own
kind) 

As you may will understand though either doing it this way, or making
it a larger coin, would mean totally rebuilding that part of the money
code although it would make it simpler if only bankers recognized it
and cashed them.

For some reason I got the impression that it is one of the things on
the to do list which they never get around to doing.
