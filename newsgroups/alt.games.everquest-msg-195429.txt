I think he was limiting discussion to the continous type 
regens (Clarity, PoTG, SP) and the like.  

At max level for it, Harvest returns 300mana every 100 ticks,
so 3 per tick.

3 charges every 15 minutes - 
+900 mana
-1350 hp
at a mana cost of 400 - spec/scm/focus
 
Most common case - conj speced, no scm aa or mana focus

net mana = (900-360) or 540 mana in 150 ticks or 3.6 mana
per tick.

You have to be able to keep up with the 9hp per tick avg
loss.  Phantasmal protection adds +5hp per tick, add regen
3 and keeping up is easy.

Also, you have to be sure to eat a charge every 5 minutes
exactly (I set a timer that dings every 5 minutes)
