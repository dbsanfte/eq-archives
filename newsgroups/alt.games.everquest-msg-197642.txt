As a human cleric who was completely blind at night, I kept an eye out for
ultravision items.  You know what I found?

Nothing!

Not until I got into Vex Thal, anyway.  There are a couple of All/All items
that drop in Vex Thal that give you ultravision when equipped.  I have an
Eye of Darkness now and my quality of life has gone up signficantly.

Outside of VT items, though, I haven't seen any All/All items that offer
ultravision.
