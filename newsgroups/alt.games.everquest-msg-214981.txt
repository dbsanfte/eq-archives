Upon further reflection of your arguments, I beleive you are right.

Though it remains to be seen whether a judge would in fact hold SOEs 
EULA up in the face of an actual challenge. I do not beleive SOEs EULA 
would stand up; there are a number of clauses that I think infringe on 
our rights.

For example, I am highly skeptical that SOEs can legally prevent a 
guardian from purchase it for his son, but not be allowed to play it 
himself. Or to let both his sons play it on their single home computer, 
or when the first son goes to college or (to be highly cynical) dies in 
a car accident let the 2nd son play it, etc.

The password NDA requirement, comes into play here, as naturally, the 
parent and his kids will all know the password in the various scenarios.
