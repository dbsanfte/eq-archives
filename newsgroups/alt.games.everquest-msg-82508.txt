Are folks just not reading the patch message?

They specifically stated that the "recommended level"
stuff was just another tag...it in no way impairs the
functionality of the item for folks in any way.

Not saying that they might not go that route, but just
that it's NOT that way NOW.  "Recommended level of
60" is just their way of saying "A level 1 could gate with
this, but we feel as developers that nobody should need
a Thurg Gate potion until doing the Coldain quests at
level 60."
