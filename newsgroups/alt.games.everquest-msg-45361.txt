I use pricewatch a -lot- to see what current prices are.  At my last job, I
was in charge of making purchasing decisions for many people, and I also
build / upgrade systems for people.  I hate trying a new "internet store",
as you never know what you will get.

For the last 2.5 years, I have been buying my parts almost exclusively at
Multiwave Direct ( http://www.mwave.com ) and have had no problems at all
with them.  I recommend using them for your parts purchases, assuming their
prices on what you want are pretty close to the next guys'.  I'll pay a
couple of dollars more if I know I'm dealing with a company that hasn't
screwed me after quite a few purchases.
