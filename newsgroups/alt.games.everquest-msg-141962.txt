Ok,I went out and bought a new HARDWARE based modem,a Diamond
Superamax V.92.
Now I've been on a few times and played,it was great, I even zoned way
faster than before. ) Now I have a new prob, as of today I get to load
the Torv server, it loads it and then the screen is supposed to go to
char select,
well it doesnt.The screen goes black and the comp is making noise like
its loading but it is just frozen. I have to turn off the comp to get
off now.
Now what? I checked and my DirectX works,so does the sound and
modem.Just a blank screen with some green little lines across the
top.Frustrating. )
