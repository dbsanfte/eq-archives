I think PvP games tend to inherently draw more bitching than PvE games.  Take
EQ1 Wizards vs. Druids, for example, from pre-Kunark through Luclin.
Generally, during that time, for most situtations, Druids were better than
Wizards, and we Wizards bitched about it, but it was relatively mild
bitching.  In a PvE game, the Druid being "better" than the Wizard meant
they had an easier time getting groups, could kill things easier than us,
and stuff like that.  It's an advantage to them, but we can just shrug, and
go cast our big nukes and lures and stuff like that, so it didn't really
make the game *bad* for us that Druids were better.

If EQ1 had been PvP, and the Druid advantages over Wizards in PvE carried
over, it would have been very different.  Then, one class being noticably
better than another can make the gaming experience very bad for the inferior
class.  I'd sure have been pissed if every time I went out and fought a
Druid, they hit me with their almost-mana-free-and-last-freaking-forever
snare, threw on a DOT, started nuking, and, if I somehow did ever get the
upper hand, used their SOW or better to run away.

So, in an PvP game, any inbalance will draw a lot more fire than it would in
a PvE game.  Second, suppose the company *does* get things balanced...what
happens?  Answer: people still bitch a lot!  In a PvE game, players win the
vast majority of the fights against mobs.  In a balanced PvP game, you'll
run into a lot more fair fights, and on average you'll lose half of them,
and for many people, that sends them to the boards to bitch about their
class.
