Forager has definitely spawned under the world a few times on Drinal. I was
with a tracker trying to get to ythe spawn when we encountered this problem,
right down to pinpointing the area. When petitioned we were informed that
the GMs were aware of the problem and it was being looked into. If you can
track it to a specific location and its not physically there I'd say
probably tyhe best bet would be to petition. I think the forager had to be
respawned on Drinal but I'm not completely sure on that count.

Hope that's of some use
