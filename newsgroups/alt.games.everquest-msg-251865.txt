http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Magician
doesn't list a single target DS for magicians past level 56
No wait, it does, it just doesn't realize it;
http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=2276
which is the details page for Flameshield of Ro clearly states that it 
is a single target spell after all.  Just so happens I never got this 
spell handing in EPs, and didn't see any reason to buy it the one time I 
saw it for sale, since it (I thought) wass a group spell and hardly any 
upgrade to my 60 version.

AH, now thats a helpful suggestion I haven't heard before.  So I was 
right in surmising that pets basically use the mob aggro formula, but 
back off is basically a mem blur?

Difference between the two targets, rather than having one target be 
very very low?  Nuking could be used to create that gap, thats for sure.

Well, if you were using the lower level heals, that doesn't say a lot 
for your logic here, while magician pets aren't great, what you are 
suggesting is like a shaman who hasn't picked up a heal since level 40 
saying that they can't heal at 63.

Lets take a look, though, because I still suspect that you have a very 
good point.

> 
LOY has a pet HOT, heals 80 points per tic for 5 tics, 400 or 480 hp for 
200 mana.  Great when you get it, of increasingly lower use as you level 
up.  By now I should probably have abandoned it, but its still my third 
best heal, and used in rotation with the other two heals is pretty much 
the most healing output I can possibly do, going flat out.

Transon's Elemental Infusion is a 580 point heal for 275 mana at 52nd
Transon's Elemental Renewal is a 900 point heal for 400 mana at 60
the heal I don't have is Planar Renewal, 1250 points for 300 mana at 64

Long recycle times mean its not possible to chain TER flat out, but it 
is possible to chain alternating TER/TEI.  Thats 1480 hp of heals every 
12 seconds more or less, with the normal spell gem repop time up against 
the spiked ring spell haste.  Adding in the Primal Remedy brings that up 
to around 1600 hp per 12 seconds or 300 hp per tic.

Now, thinking about a typical fight:  Mob that double hits for 200 a pop 
once per tic; thats 400 damage per tic.  Pet has roughly 4000hp, so 
he'll live about 10 tics with no healing.  In those 10 tics I can heal 
3000 hp, so he'll live longer, say 6 more tics.  But during those 6 tics 
I can heal another 1800 hp, which is another 4 tics, which is 1200 more 
hp in heals, and so on.  Eventually the mob catches up... but more 
likely I'm OOM first.  Lets see, we're guessing about 1350 mana every 30 
seconds, or 10 tics.  How much mana in a typical pool at 63, 3150? 
Thats about a minute and a half worth of heals.

I don't need to heal anywhere near that much, though, as the pet is 
stopping about a half the incoming damage with stuns and mitigation from 
his primary target.  Thing is, he's not doing that with his second 
target, so it goes from 200 damage per tic down to 600 damage per tic. 
Now he only lives 6 tics the first time thru, only gets 3 tics in added 
life, during which he only gets 1 and a half extra, during which he only 
gets the other half at best.  He has to be able to take out one of the 
attackers in under 11 tics total.

Cycling Planar Renewal with TER would be better... and just casting PR 
without anything else would be better still, since the mana cost is 
lower and the heal level much higher; I bet the cycle time on it is 
pretty long though.

Question is, would it be better to nuke instead?  Say the pet is doing 
quad hits for about 75 each, and is hasted to the point where he's 
getting in about 6 shots in a tic.  Thats around 450 damage per tic.  If 
the mob has 5,000 hp... hmm, how the heck does the pet ever kill 
anything?  It will take him around 11 tics to finish off his target.

If I nuke for 2000, this will shorten the pet portion of the fight to 7 
tics.  Nuke twice and the pet only has to do 3 tics worth of work

Without healing him at all, the pet should be able to take 6 tics from 
two mobs, so if we can eliminate one target in 3 tics, pet should be at 
half health (2000hp) with no heals.  Against the single target he's only 
taking a third what he was before, so he's good for 6 more tics.  This 
means I'll still have to do two nukes to the second mob in order to get 
the kill time down under the 6 tics I have left.

4 Firebolts costs 2000 mana.  Healing flat out for 10 tics will cost 
about 1350 mana, plus I'll still have to heal for the second mob, 
another 800 mana or so if I can get away with nothing but TER's, which 
should be possible.  This means the healing method runs 2150 mana for 
the same result.

Now those are all pretty rough approximations, so I'd expect some 
variation.  But it looks to me as though the two are fairly similar, and 
that healing might actually get the edge with Planar Remedy in some 
circumstances, unless I also get substantially better nukes to go along 
with that.

I'll try a different comparison.

Nukes run about 4 hp per mana at my level, if they do full damage.
My best heal at the moment, TER, is good for 2.25 hp per mana
Planar Renewal will clock in at 4.166666 hp per mana
(none of the above figures include any focus effects)

This would seem to suggest that my current heals are far worse than my 
current nukes... but that PR will be much more competitive.  Heals have 
an advantage in that they are never resisted, not completely, not 
partially.  Mage heals have the disadvantage, though, that they seem to 
have long cast times and recycle times just as long; my HP per mana 
ratio might be good with heals but my HPS rate isn't going to be good at 
all.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky in a relatively narrow passage with two 
angry mobs and a third mob at the far end I don't want to get in aggro 
range of.

I am familiar with mount death; for a critter touted as a way to get 
high speed movement, its amazingly slow "zero to 60" speed makes it an 
amazing impediment.  Its a lot more like a funny shaped Lazy-Boy on 
wheels.  When I think danger is likely, I often dismount and to hecate 
with the mana regen.  But it is a LOT of mana regen, if I can use it 
without worry.

That could be a real edge then in this situation, where I'm stuck with 
two mobs like it or not.  Haven't been in many situations recently where 
there were two unmezzed mobs beating on my group standing close enough 
together for me to hit both with rains.

Well, perhaps what I need is foursomes of Cyan mobs, then, get that 
efficiency way up.  Works for druids doesn't it?

Pet Ch would be sweet.  But just pet heals the same size as the ones 
beastlords get wouldn't be too bad.  Which I guess is what Planar 
Renewal is.  SO stop griping and level up already!

Splendid
