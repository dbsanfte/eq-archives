It depends on what you like.  If you like killing bozos then nothing
beats EQ still.

If you think you may be interested in crafting, VG beats EQ hands
down.  it also has things like harvesting (my personal second favorite
after killing bozos) and diplomacy.  harvesting is akin to bone chip
collecting for necros but on a much grander scale.  All crafters need
raw materials, which are supplied by harvesters.  Wood, metal, stone,
skins, and plants.  You get to pick a primary and secondary, not all
of them.
Actually you don't get to pick all of crafting either. One area of
focus, thats it.  For example, I'm an artificer and cannot be a
blacksmith.  But as an artificer I can do carpentry and stonework as
sub-skills.
VG promotes alot of cooperation, partiulcaly in crafting.  For
instance, to make a boat you need the skills of a carpenter,
blacksmith, and tailor for the boat and mast(s), rigging and
fasteners, and the sails.  It's quite a production in some cases but
in the end it's a sense of accomplishment.

The performance still leaves alot to be desired unless you have a high
end machine.  At 2.8GHz HT, 1GB RAM, and an 8x AGP ATI card (old I
realize but the top end AGP I could get) it drops to 3-4 FPS in some
places.  Usually high particle effect and multiple mob areas but still
brutal.
Supposedly there is a fix on some broken spells that recapture about
15 FPS in those instances so we'll see.

The world is huge and very cool to look at, but high end content is
supposedly  lacking.  Personally it's not an issue as my highest toon
is 31 Adventuring so I've not had an issue finding fun places with
bozos in them.

I would not have left EQ for VG if not for my guild, all RL friends.
Now that I'm there I like it and have adapted to new aspects of play.
I still like EQ and will always feel that it was the greatest computer
game ever made, but that's how I am.
