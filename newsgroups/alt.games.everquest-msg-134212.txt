When the child is capable of extending the discussion, they're probably
able to understand the answers you give. That step may be logical to us
adults, but for a child to understand that 'being born with it' isn't an
answer in itself but implicates that it must've come from the mother,
that in itself, to me, indicates a level of understanding that is more
than sufficient to broach the more complex/adult themes, albeit in a
manner the child can understand. Letting the child tell you it's ready
to understand and absorb by the very act of asking the question, if you
will.

Firstly, AIDS isn't a purely sexual disease (especially in kids), though
I concede that does come into it.

Secondly, at what age would kids come into contact with the idea of sex
and/or homosexuality? From what I've gathered (I'm a euro in a
predominately US based gaming environment) the term 'gay' is bandied
about with gay abandon (excuse the pun) in the US, especially amongst
the younger age groups. I'm sure that as soon as kids are exposed to the
outside world in any means (eg: preschool) they WILL hear that word, and
given their curiosity, ask what it means.

There were 4 girls as young as 10 giving birth to full-term children in
the UK alone last year. Unless you are 110% attentive to what your child
comes into contact with, and censor everything as you see fit, they WILL
see all these things before you dreamt they were 'ready'.

Because it's not SS introducing the ideas of sex, homosexuality and
AIDS. They may be the ones actually tackling the issue head-on (pro-
actively). Like it or not, kids KNOW about these things. Impossible to
prove, but I'd put money on 95% of 'facts of life' talks falling onto
little ears that already knew far more about the subject than you
thought.

I just think it's a little naive to blame SS for introducing the
subject, when what I believe they are doing is simply reacting to a
subject that has already been broached. Not only for South Africa where
the show is being aired, but also in the hypothetical implementation in
western markets.
