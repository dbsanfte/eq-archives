OK, but how about 3rd edition D&D compared to, say EQ1?  I think one of the
things that I liked about NWN as a computer game was that because the rules
were all laid out, I felt like I knew what I was doing when I made
decisions.  In EQ1, and most other MMORPGs, they hide so much that a lot of
times I find I'm making important character decisions and it is a crap
shoot.  Got a choice between a slightly better weapon and slightly better
armor?  In EQ1, unless you can find online where someone has extensively log
parsed and reverse engineered the rules, you have no good way to decide
which is better.  In a D&D rules game, you could tell.

I think pretty much all MMORPGs go to far in hiding things.  They think it
is making the game more "realistic" or "immersive" or something, but what
they are missing is that this information is what the players need to
substitute for what would be years of experience for the character.  E.g., a
Warrior with decades of battle experience would be able to pick up a sword,
and know how well he will do with it, or put on some armor and know from all
that experience what it would do.  Players need numbers for those things.
