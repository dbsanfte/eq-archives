Yep yep, more troll bait.

Bards, whats up with that.  Can't tank, crap melee DPS, lousy DOT
dps, DD DPS a serious joke.  Can they do damage?  Yep, they can
charm something and have it do damage... but they can't buff that
something up with their songs, nor can they buff up any other
pets the group might have, and they don't get charm till mid game
and their charm has a max level so that out of the mid game it
becomes useless again, a discarded strategium (if briefly a
fantasticly effective one).  Mana regen?  Maybe for you but not
for themselves, in fact they are immune to not only their own
mana songs, but every sort of mana buff or transfer system you
might think of; only FT and some AA work to give their mana regen
any kind of boost at all.

Haste, you say?  Well yes but not much of one, at any given level
other haste classes have better hastes, until 50 when they
finally get something unique; a haste that adds to the haste of
regular buff type haste... by 5%.  Need even more levels before
this is actually a useful line, rather than a silly joke.  Slow?
Again, their slow sucks compared to other slowers at any given
level.  Snare?  Yes, they can snare -a- target for 18 seconds at
a time, while otehr classes get snares that last the entire life
span of the target; bards can do that only by keeping the snare
running.

OK resists; thats something bards do head and shoulders over
other classes, and better it stacks.  But how often do you need
resists?  Not many mobs do anything worth resisting, and like
practically everything else bards do, the resists last 18 seconds
unless you sacrifice song output to dedicate to refreshing them.

DS, here too, bards shine, yeilding a good DS that actually
stacks with buff DS and potion DS, and if you are willing to
equip or juggle a drum, the DS really is a very nice one.  Since
the DS works only in group, though, its not useful for PLing
(which is where DS really shines) and so applies only inasmuch as
the mobs are permitted to hit their group mates; slow the mob (as
eventually you must) and the DS damage is reduced by the same
amount, use non contact killing methods and the DS works not at
all.

Why then are bards regarded as the ultimate power class by many,
when any mention them at all (due to ignorance or a justifiable
fear that if the powers that be find out about bards, the nerf
bat can't be far behind?).  Because most of what they can do,
they do without use of mana -or- hit point expenditure.  Never
touch the mobs, because you run faster than them and don't have
to stop to cast, and you don't spend HP on them.  Unless you are
charming or using a last ditch style DD, there's no mana cost, so
the issue of mana regen doesn't come up... and if you are
charming, the actual mana cost is low enough that FT 1 is pretty
much all you need to keep up... an FT 1 item on the bard is the
equivalent of an FT 10 item on any other caster class anyway,
since it gives them such a large jump in mana regen.

That, and that they can do many of those things at the same time;
crappy melee plus crappy DOTs plus crappy slow plus crappy snare
plus crappy resist debuff plus decent DS, all at the same time,
without ever running OOM?  Not too shabby.
