I have done this quest a few times (hoping to get a full set of Bloodforge
armour for twinking purposes).

I read extensively about Zarchoomi and how to get her to spawn and these are
the best theories I came across;

1).Zarchoomi will only spawn if Corflunk is alive for 15 mins.

2).The goblin shaman is a placeholder for Zarchoomi.

Whenever I have killed the goblin shaman (somewhere between the x-roads and
the entrance to Dagnar's Cauldron) Zarchoomi seems to spawn around the DC
entrance, sometimes in north of the hill in front of the entrance.

It hasn't seem to have helped with me, if Corflunk is alive for more than 15
mins or not, but some people swear by it.

It certainly helps if you have access to a character with tracking

Good Luck
