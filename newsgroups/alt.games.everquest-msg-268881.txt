The hair you're splitting here could hardly be finer. Wearing the guild 
tag, in any guild worth its salt, implies some level of commitment, of 
course. Therefore, whereas sure, some may take guild membership lightly 
and flaunt the tag just to boast, your pointing this out does not 
disprove the claim that many display a guild tag out of legitimate pride.

42 criticized the use of guild tags, referring to their use as an 
"asinine herd mentality" and asserted that it was used primarily as some 
meaningless form of personal validation. That was disputed. Let's stay 
focused and not pick every nit that might pop up, shall we?

Mincing words doesn't change anything. Your own words were "You're 
working for the personal satisfaction of knowing that other people know 
you're in that guild." That implies selfish motives, unless by "personal 
satisfaction" you meant that of others, which of course you didn't. 
Selfish means being concerned with one's self, not necessarily to the 
detriment of others.
