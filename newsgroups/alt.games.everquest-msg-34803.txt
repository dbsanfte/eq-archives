Really?  Mine aren't even close. Hell I've effectively soloed for the last
few levels (grouping whenever possible which is about not at all), and while
my Evocation skill is maxed, my Alteration, not only hasn't maxed out "as
quick" ... it isn't maxed out (period).

Again with the corpses...
Nuke things to turn them into corpses... then show some respect, you're a
wizard, dammit.

Oh, don't get me wrong... DO keep an eye on it... DO train evocation... DO
make sure that spec evo hits 51 first... but, if you're doing your job
right, you won't have to sweat this too much...

Unless you figure "why train spec conjure... I never use it" in which case
all of your specializations with hit 50... then you'll realize you error,
train Spec Conjure, and the next time you go invisible you'll become "Dumass
the Diviner."
