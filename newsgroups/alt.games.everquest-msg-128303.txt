Yes, definately. I have calmy told a few people that we have no chance of
fixing the issue with them as angry as they are, suggest they take a 10
minute walk and call back. Then I inform them I am about to end the call and
hang up. That's about as far as you can go, but then, it's about as far as
you need to go.

Of course as soon as I am off the phone everyone else hears about what an
absolute dipshit he was...  ; )
