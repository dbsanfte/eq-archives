FWIW I never got aggro from it but I got it recently. Never heard anyone 
saying they got aggro from it either.

I did exe trial for the first time since I got DvA yesterday and for the 
first heal I used DvA and followed with ethereal elixir without getting 
aggro. Heal aggro is pretty bad in there, supernal would've had the mobs 
  that weren't being tanked on me.
