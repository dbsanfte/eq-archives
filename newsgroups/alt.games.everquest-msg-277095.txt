Just thought I'd let you all know the response I got from SOE CS about the 
change of update / restart times for Splitpaw to match the other Euro 
servers that Moorgard said would happen "soon" after the transfers were 
completed on the forums in this message.

Their reply was :-

"Unfortunately, at the time that Moorgard made that post he was not aware
of the issues with how we handle server updates.

Because Splitpaw and Runnyeye on within our internal network they are
connected to the same branch of hardware, when we push data to the US
servers that same data has to be pushed to Runnyeye and Splitpaw at the
same time.

Our Platform team is working on correcting this however that is
completely out of both Customer Service and Developments hands."


So what they're saying I think is that now it's on the US server update list 
they don't know how to move it to the Euro list and we're stuck with the 
12pm GMT restart times.
