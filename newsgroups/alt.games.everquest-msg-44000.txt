<snipped the same quote we've seen so many times lately>

I've run across this behavior in RL too.  You go to a dance club with a
handful of friends and friends of friends in several cars.  One of them gets
rejected by one girl too many and decides, "This place fucking sucks!"  And
can't seem to go more than ten minutes at a stretch without reminding
everyone he knows that this is still the way he feels.

Well I'll tell you and all the rest of the die-hard bitchers what I tell
them.  If you don't like it, then go.  I do like it, so I'll be staying,
your best efforts notwithstanding.
