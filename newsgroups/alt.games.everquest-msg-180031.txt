I guess a bottle of Depakote isnt lethal?

God commanded me to kill myself last night so I put a rather large amount of
Depakote down my throat and he was there the entire time basically shouting
at me to keep taking more and more until I felt like I was going to throw up
and then he told me to stop and lay down, so I did and then he just kept
telling me not to throw up and my heart would start beating super fast and
he would just keep encouraging me and telling me that I would just go to
sleep and die in my sleep, and that he would have preferred it if I had cut
my wrists to be sure but I was too scared to do that, and he told me that if
I wanted to be a prophet I couldn't be afraid of death. I get the feeling
that the thing that separates apostles and prophets from everyone else is
the possibility of death.

God basically pointed to the thing my selfish heart desires more than
anything and said that I can never have it, and that it is no fault of mine,
it is just the way it is, and I could have just about anything else but
that, and that I needed to choose between him and it, and reminded me of all
the destruction that has occured in my life as a result, and that I had just
tried to kill myself, although he had given me permission to do it and that
is why I am still alive, that I was trying to get to it, and that I
shouldn't feel bad that everyone has something that gets under their skin
and causes them problems and I was no different from anyone else in that
respect and that I had asked to be saved and that is what is happening
