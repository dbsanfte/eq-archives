Group,

I play without any sound at all, and don't feel I'm missing much.
What I like to do, is call my buddy on my cel phone (unlimited nights
and weekends), and talk to him while we play.  I use headphones that I
just don't put on much when playing EQ.  

Since you have to read the text messages anyway, the RED really stands
out when you're geting hit. I prefer to listen to my stereo - either
music, or the BBC when that's on.

Julie
