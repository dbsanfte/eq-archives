I was always paranoid about some very tough mobs i heard that spawned there?
I might have to go there anyway; working on my shawl quests means using
velium hound fur and no-one sells that now, alas. I really hate charm; could
never get into the paranoid aspect of being eaten by a pet... I admire
enchatners but when i play mine it's just so i can cast some spells to
enchant things and go back to being a druid or (my true love) a monk.

GoD just seems crazy; i got chased down by a noc that was proccing for 490
each hit; and it seemed to run at sow speed. And it just shrugged off snare
after snare without the "immune to run speed changes" warning (high mr?). I
died fast.

When my pc's (sic?) were working 2 boxing in velks was easy and not bad xp
but no-one wants to buy the drops now (alas! that made me lot of cash).
