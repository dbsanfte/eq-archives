Did. Most of my friends have left the game already, when they
kept falling through the world every 15 mins and couldnt get a GM
for weeks and weeks. I dont know about your server, but Tarew
Marr is rapidly becomming a "Ghost Server" ...


And Guilds in EQ are a Joke. I have had two guilds self-destruct
because the members couldnt figure out how to work together and
tore apart the guilds with petty internal politics and fighting.
I have no indications that any EQ guild has figured out that they
should be a cooperative, with everyone in the guild both getting
help, and GIVING help. Too much Greed for my tastes.

In actual experiance I am not finding that to be true. The mobs
that are soloable at 65 have much greater hp and take much longer
to kill than those that produced xp at 58 (and are now green at
L65)
