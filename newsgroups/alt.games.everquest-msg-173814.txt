You left out the end of the story, of when the usefulness of the Kurds
was at an end for propoganda purposes, their issues were dropped like
a dirty rag, never to be heard from again, in what was called by some
the "biggest betrayal in American history".

But then, the fellow you're talking to tends to only read the
propoganda, so he may not be aware of that.
