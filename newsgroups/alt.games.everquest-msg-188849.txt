Just wondering where are still good pick-up zones for a non-PoP 56 lvl
cleric.  Velks is a ghost town these days and pretty much a
bring-your-own-group zone after PoP came out.  Maiden Eye is even worse.
Most times ME doesn't have a soul in it.  KC is still viable (though not as
much after PoP) but it's not the greatest XP ... not to mention it's boring
after hunting there so long.  Lately, I've been only playing EQ if when I
get on, there's friends online, and I can join them.

As for why I'm not getting PoP, it is simply that Star Wars Galaxies is
about to come out and I cannot justify the expense since if SWG is really
good, I'll likely be playing that instead of EQ.  Not sure I'll cancel my EQ
account.  Depends how good SWG turns out to be. Having gotten to 56 lvl as a
cleric, I pretty much feel I've won the game ... so to speak.  I don't think
about leveling anymore.  My gear is pretty much the best you can get outside
of ToV gear and does me well in groups and raids.
