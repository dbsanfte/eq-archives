Actually, rather than try to "list" every specific thing, they could
just broaden their categories, which would not make the rules
any longer, but would make them more encompassing.

It's not like exceptions/loopholes turn up every day, they've
already done a pretty good job of revising the "rules" to cover
most of the obnoxious things that players-who-ought-to-be-banned
have managed to come up with to date.

All they need do is issue a rules revision the next time someone
gets a bit more creative than usual and manages to do something
that deserves the boot and doesn't quite fit under the existing
rules (or is enough on the edge to be debatably not covered by
them).

That's why I said that if they changed the disputed "misspellings"
clause to instead read "suggestive variations", they'd have pretty
much all the bases covered.  It's a broader term, which pretty
much catches all manner of "cutesy" name variations.

All Mom has to do is broaden her prohibition to "no harming each
other" instead of "no fighting", and she can cover a lot more ground
with no more breath.
