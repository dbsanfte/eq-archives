You could buy resist gear to raise  "resist disease", but that would
be pretty expensive for your level if you aren't twinked.

3 Casts of the low level spell "Cure Disease" will remove it. So you
could try grouping with a Shaman/Druid/Cleric.

The best option might be to avoid fightinf the Phlargs. Move to the
Hollowshade side of PC and hunt the bugs and mushrooms.
