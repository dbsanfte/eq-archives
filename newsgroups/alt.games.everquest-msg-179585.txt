Same as always, in my experience. I don't claim it is now nor has ever
been *good*...

What do you expect for constantly trying to evolve rickety 5+ year-old
code?

I've seen enough both ways on internal testing, really. Some glaring
bugs get through, but some things can't be caught until they're tested
by thousands of people on thousands of different system
configurations. *shrug* Again, not good, but not that horrid either.

While not rare, I haven't experienced server/zone crashes "all the
time". Lost data would be another effect of rickety old code being
stretched to its limits.

Well, since others are so quick to ask it of me... Cite.

Also been a headache and more high maintenence than any other type of
game. For example. the team working on DiabloII LOD's code, last I
heard, was as few as 3 people presently, and it's not even half as old
as EQ.

Of course, we also have to look at advertising (which has definately
been stepped up), other publicity, production, shipment, etc costs,
not to mention paying their lawyers for people who seem to want to sue
them every time they turn around. ("Everquest killed my son! Nevermind
that he was a suicidal nutcase before he ever heard of Everquest...")

While their profit margins have likely gone up, I'd be surprised to
learn that it's anywhere near as much as you and William seem to
beleive.
