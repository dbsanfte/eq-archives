She's an Erudie, and her name is Devin Traical :-

You say, 'Hail, Devin Traical'
Devin Traical says 'Greetings Skwashie.  I assume you have come to speak to
me about [Shadowrest]?'
You say, 'what about shadowrest?'
Devin Traical says 'Ahh, perhaps not.  Shadowrest is, for lack of better
description, the Realm of the Lost.  In essence, when things leave the
material plane, that is where they go. We only recently learned of its
existence, who knows what other secrets lie waiting in the Great Library,
but I digress.  We have managed to procure an. . . agreement with the Keeper
of Shadowrest.  While the price of the arrangement is not important, the
[reward] may be.'
You say, 'what reward?'
Devin Traical says 'The Keeper has agreed to allow us to recover corpses
lost from the material plane.  This is the extent of the arrangement.  If
your body has left this realm the Keeper may be able to recover it for you.
Would you like to [travel] to Shadowrest?'

I don't have a corpse, so didn't take her up on her offer.
