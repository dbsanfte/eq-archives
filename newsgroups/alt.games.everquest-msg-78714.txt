The newbieness of a new game is always cool.  The real test of on line
games is how long you still play.  When I tried AC it was fun, lasted a
few days, don't even think it was weeks before that wore off.  AO was
great fun (when it worked) for a few weeks because it was so different. 
Still, that lost out in gameplay by mid levels, even if they did have
really nice sunsets.  EQ for  some odd reason seems to work for me, try
though I might to find something new, I still look forward to playing
it.
