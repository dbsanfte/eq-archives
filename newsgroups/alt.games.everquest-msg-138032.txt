I am a lvl 57 Pally. I made the mistake of sticking exclusively to 2HS until I
was lvl 30 because of the greater damage. I decided then (and I am glad I did)
that I ought to put some work into 1hs and acquired a Wurmslayer. Fortunately I
upped my 1hs over the next few levels in High Pass basement with a few
guild-mates who did not mind that I was not as effective as I might have been
with a 2hs weapon.

Now at lvl 57 I have the choice of using a 2hs axe 32dmg/ 37 dly or a 1hs MDS
28dmg/30dly. I opt almost exclusively for the 1hs MDS because I have a 25ac
shield and the extra ac is really useful plus being able to bash is also very
useful.  Also at lvl 49 as a Pally you get the Divine Might spell which gives
you a direct damage 65hp process which will work with any weapon including
bash.
