I think what he was trying to say in so many words was that, *puts on
thinking cap* that constantly saying "thank you" in group chat can get a bit
overbearing and I can see the aspect that everyone has a job in a group.
Though most i know when they first join a group and are buffed or healed say
"thank you" I have never felt it required to say thank you anymore after
that.  Just doing my job.  *grin* of course they don't get lectured for it.
think that was what he was trying to say.

and i agree with ya a group does not need to be constantly SOWed when
camping an area, mainly a puller.  of course it depends on the area being
camped.  think he was using that as an example you silly brent.
