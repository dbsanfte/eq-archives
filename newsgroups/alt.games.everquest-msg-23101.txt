Go to www.practicallynetworked.com - all the info you need is there.

Basically leave his existing card and connection and IP address as it
is. It's probably grabbing its IP address from the cable company using
DHCP anyway. Install a second NIC and ICS, telling the installer which
card to use for the connection and which to share locally. *Don't*
change the NIC the cable modem is going into, it probably has its MAC
address registered for access with the cable company, so if you use a
different one or a router or something for the cable connection, you
need to phone up the cable company and tell them. The installer should
set the new NIC to a local IP address (192.168.0.1 or something I
think). Set all the other PCs to use DHCP for grabbing an address -
they'll get their IP from the built-in DHCP server in ICS. To play EQ
you'll need to open up some ports in ICS. For Win98SE just download ICS
config from the above site, and look on the port mappings page for that
program - theres already a configuration file to download with the port
mappings for EQ (on the second page of downloads I believe). In Win2K,
you can actually configure the ports in Windows rather than using a 3rd
party kludge, just look at that configuration file (or the info on
everquest.station.sony.com) to see what to set them to.

Everyone else then just plugs into the same hub as his 2nd NIC is
plugged into.

You shouldn't have problems actually playing, but you may not all be
able to login at the same moment...
