Everything goes with you.  If you intend to move, just do the /movelog
command when they tell you.  Probably a few weeks later they'll actually do
the split and they'll keep you posted as to when that'll be.

I wouldn't worry too much about making the cut.  They CLAIM that just
because you do a /movelog doesn't mean you WILL move but I can't think of a
recent (in the last year) split that they didn't give everyone another
chance a month later (but not to move back).
