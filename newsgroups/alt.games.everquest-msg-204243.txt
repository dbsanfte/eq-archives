I am really confused (Does not much)  I got a 34 dru Half elf with 670
hp and 115 wis  Was playing today at Darkshroud Peaks and in group.
There was a dru there ( About same lvl)  with 1200 or about hp.  I was
there basically to heal.  Really could not fight due to damage.  

I need inputs on this this issue and suggestions please.  Thanks
