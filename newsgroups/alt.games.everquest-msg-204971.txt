Yeah, I really should've mentioned that, could be a nasty welcome on
the drop. These days he might actually be up for more than a few
hours. 

We used to do a lot of exping in the Hole, down by the dock, and would
not see Yael on track for months at a stretch. Last time we headeded
in (a couple of weeks ago) we actually had to take the long way down
because he was up. 

I do hope they get around to raising the level range there, that zone
has always been a favorite of mine.
