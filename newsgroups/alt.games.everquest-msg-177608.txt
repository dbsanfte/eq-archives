True, but my thinking is that you should wait until just before DA fades 
before backing away. That way you can avoid the situation where you back 
up, the mobs goes with you, you back up again, the mob goes with you - 
all while the tank has to work harder to stay within melee range. 

If after 15 seconds or so, the tank wasn't able to build enough hate to 
surpass what you may have gotten through proximity (after all, they're 
just as close to the mob at this point as you are), then you may as well 
start casting/swinging/biting/scratching because you're probably in the 
mix for the duration.  :)
