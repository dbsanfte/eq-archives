61st mage here, and I agree completely with Rumble.  STAND STILL until
the tank has some time to build some aggro, then step back.  Running
around in a circle makes it harder for them.  Remember, ofthen they have
to come off another mob to save you, and need to be able to target.

OTOH - In my mid 50's I've been able to channel scars through a lot of
hits and finish mobs, but it's not something I'd try in PoP.
