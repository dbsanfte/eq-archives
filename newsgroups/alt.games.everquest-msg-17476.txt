You can move the default position of most windows by clicking in the
little "box" in the upper left of the window, moving the window
around, then clicking again on the little box to nail it down.

That should help a lot, but you can't move the "item info" box
that way because as soon as you move your mouse to try to click
on it, it goes away.  But you can reposition it explicitly by
editing your eqclient.ini file (in your Everquest directory).
Look for the following entries:

    ItemDataWinY=225    <- Y coordinate of upper-left corner
    ItemDataWinX=200    <- X coordinate of upper-left corner
    ItemDataWinH=150    <- Height of window
    ItemDataWinW=400    <- Width of window

There will be three complete sets of these, under the following
groups:

   [Windows640]
   [Windows800]
   [Windows1024]

Each of these applies to one of three different full-screen
screen resolutions.  If you're using 800x600 mode, fiddle with
the "ItemDataWin" settings under the "[Windows800]" category.

You should play with the "X" and "Y" positions, leave the
Height and Width alone.

Unfortunately, there's no way to do this from within the program,
so you'll have to leave Everquest, try some new settings, go
back into Everquest to see how they look, etc.
