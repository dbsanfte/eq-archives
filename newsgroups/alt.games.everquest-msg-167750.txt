Well I've finally gone and gotten a character over 50 and that means I'm
looking for a guild with 50+ players.  Meaning, I am in over my head.  I
talked to another player last night about a guild and she said they were on
CoV faction.  She said I would need to kill Giants to get this faction up.
So I guess that means they want dragons to like them right?  So what is CoV
and why is this faction important?  What places does that allow them to go?
What other guild factions are there?  What guild faction is most common and
why?  What places will this faction mean that I will miss out on? What is
CoV anyway?
