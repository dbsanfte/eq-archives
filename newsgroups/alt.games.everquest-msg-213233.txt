It seems that going over 500 traders was causing some kind of overflow

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.

-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000

by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
