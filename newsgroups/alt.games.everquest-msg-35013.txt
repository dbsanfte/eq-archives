For the guy that logged out lvl 18 and back in at 17 there was not a save
done on your account before you logged. If you /exit or /q you are not saved
before the server logs you out. So whatever has happened since your last
save is not recognized. This can go for LDs also. They do have some
preventative measures to try and keep this from happening, but it is not
foolproof. ALWAYS sit
 and /camp before leaving the game. You can also force a save by trading 1cp
to a PC or NPC.
