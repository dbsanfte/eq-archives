Doh.  Ok.  Thanks.

I did find some skullcap quests, but I can't get the NPC in question
to respond to the key phrase "adept at tailoring" now...  So I'm a bit
stuck...

I'm guessing I have to raise my tailoring skill enough before he'll
respond further.  But I won't be working on tailoring anytime soon.
My iksar necro is terribly, terribly broke.  At level 10 I only have
two of my level 8 spells.  I probably don't know where the 'monkey
maker' mobs are in the area.  Gotta find 'em...
