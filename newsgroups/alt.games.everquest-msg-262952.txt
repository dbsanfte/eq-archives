Seeing as your original words are still shown above, It's absolutely
impossible for me to have misquoted you.

I mentioned an ubertank because it suits the point I wish to make.
Everyones gear level can impact the success of the group.    Yet it's only
the tanks whom people seem to feel it is appropriate to question.     That
is a double standard that is annoying me.   You're esentially telling me
that if I'm not Plane of Time equipped, then I'm not well enough geared to
tank for your (partially elemental) group.
