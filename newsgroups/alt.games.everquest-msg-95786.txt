But wait,  what about being in a group and another member goes dead? 
You need these..

If chargrpmbr=LDCleric or LDWarrior or LDEnchanter all group members ld1

heck maybe even

If pullermisjudged all grpmbr ld1

I mean why should everyone die just because the puller made a boo boo?

or

if toomanyadds all grpmbr ld1

Its  not fair that everyone has to die just because several wanderers
decided to come along.

Why does having an unstable connection deserve more protection than
those who are too stupid to live?  Should be more protection for the
stupid, those with bad connect can do something about it but stupid
folks is stupid for life.

th
math is hard
