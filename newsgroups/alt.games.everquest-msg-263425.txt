  Yeah, it does seem to be one of those slippery terms.  By EQ standards I
was casual player because I never leveled very fast or far, or got very
good gear.  My my friend and family's standards, I was just short of
obsessed with the game.

   Thanks for explaining this.  I'm really curious if I'm going to be a
healer at all, actually.  I rerolled my empathy Defender in CoH (for
reference to others, empathy defenders are the closest things to pure
healers that CoH has) in favor of a Storm Defender (who is more orientated
to debuffing/buffing) because, well, healing got boring.  I think that
might have been part of my problem with EQLive, too.  I really enjoyed the
middle game with my cleric because I could feel so many roles, but as I
moved upwards I was in more and more situations where it was simply best
for me to do one thing pretty much; heal.

   Well, pretty true, but now that I think on it, I do think that there are
hardcore players in CoH also.  Instead of gear, they collect levels and
influence.  However, I think that the lack of gear is going to be a big
factor in Hardcore burnout once they reach the upper limits of the game.

    I do like grouping.  But I have been in so many bad groups, and spent
so much time in EQLive wasting time trying to get in a group or get one
together, that I like to know that soloing is available.  But if groupage
is more easy to reach in EQII, I would say this would make it more casual
player friendly.

   Let me do the very same happy dance I did when I heard that serverwide
chat channels are coming to CoH.  I *love* chat channels!

   Well, maybe that will be introduced later.

   Me too.  But I guess we can't have everything we want at start up. 
Again, hopefully later we will.

   I did read it about five minutes after I wrote this question.  Sorry for
missing it the first time.  Well, I guess we can expect spoiler sites to
spring up then.  Can one at least alt-tab out of the game and check a
website without logging off?

   All in all though, this crafting system sounds very interesting to me,
and I am eager to see it in action.

Tried and true from EQLive.  No surprises there.

Hmmm...  Six slots, say filled with 6-slot bags, added up to 36.  I'm
guessing that things must either stack much more, or else less stuff must
drop than in EQL.  Still, it is nice to know that we won't have to deal
with the old "I'm rocking out there but my bags are full!" problem that I
think most of use have experienced.

/cheer!  Very nice to know.  I remember when it seemed that half my bank
slots were filled with quest items that I didn't know what were for, but
was afraid to destroy in case I needed later.  Very good addition.

   Oooooh.  Sounds a little bit like I was hoping The Sims Online might
turn out to be.  I am SO looking forward to this part.

     Well, that's nice to know, though I'm sure some little sewer rat will
find a way to give into its baser instincts and start dicking things up. 
It does sound like SOE put some serious thought into this issue though,
which to me is a good sign.

Thanks for your reports, Bob.  I don't know that EQII will lure me away
from CoH, but I am definitely interested in trying it.

So... Any idea what server you're going to be on?  Maybe this time I could
actually hook up and play with several of the AGEr's that are going to be
trying this out.
