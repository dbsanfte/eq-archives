Defense only raises when you're being hit.   If you were in a group
with a bard during your 40's, would any reasonably well-played bard
be getting hit enough to get skill increases for defense?

*shrug*   I actively train defense with my cleric.   It's almost maxed.
I'm not worried about the offensive skills, but I most definitely DO
want defense maxed ASAP.   If I didn't try to raise the skill, it would
never raise;  I just don't get hit that often normally.

At any rate, I can't imagine a good reason - given the time to do
it and a safe situation - that any class wouldn't want to train their
defense.   The INT casters have a very difficult time finding a safe
situation.   That shouldn't be true for the priest classes or any hybrid.
