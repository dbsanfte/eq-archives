A druid.

And yes, thats very likely the case... but my point still is that when 
you "find trader" to him, you get to where he ought to be, get the blue 
sparklies, but there's no trader standing there.

Because he's up on the roof.

If you get real close to underneath him, you can still but from him. 
Was a real puzzler the first time though.
