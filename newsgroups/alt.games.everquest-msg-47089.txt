I've played 3 main classes so far in the past 21 months of my EQ experience.
I first attempted a Half Elf Warrior but lost my corpse by falling down that
pit area of Blackburrow and accidentally took the long attempt out because I
didn't have a map at the time, then later lost him at LV6 to bandits in WK.
My first ever serious one was an Ogre Warrior which I made to LV17. Then a
Halfing Druid which I played to 15. Later after buying RoK and SoV together
I tried an Iksar SK to LV12. Then now a Barbarian Warrior to LV19 (almost
20) which is my main.
    I like my Barbarian warrior because I've liked being a warrior class,
and like the stats, abilities, damage, strength, of the larger races, but
Ogres were too big to deal with and faction was an issue I didn't like too
much.
    Today at work I thought about an Iksar monk (don't know why, I wasn't
even thinking about EQ or anything related to EQ, RPG, games, lizards,
monks, or anything that could be related, just suddenly thought I should try
an Iksar monk). I researched some on Caster's Realm and did notice monks are
very similar to warriors, except for the taking damage part, but they've got
some ways around that. Also I like monk's skills.
    My big question is which of the whole 2 races we get to choose from
would be the best?
1) Human...
-- NOT KOS
-- NOT Kill On Sight
-- NOT wanted dead by most.
-- NOT KOS!!!!!
-- Someone can't come up to him and start jerking on his tail.
2) Iksar...
-- Doesn't need to carry food because they can forage.
-- HP Regen
-- Tail attack
-- Comparable STR, and STA with better AGI, DEX, and WIS.
-- More common, therefore likely easier to get input/help on.
-- NOT KOS to Iksars (but being monk, can sneak his way through areas he is
KOS to).
-- KOS to all but Iksars (and those dwarfs in Velious) but he can at least
see where he is going at night so doesn't run into danger (like those night
blinds).
-- Wears a robe and looks more like a monk you'd think of, not a guy in a
suite or slacks and shirt.
-- Moves that he does when you're just standing there look cooler than just
moving your head to look to each side of you.
-- When bored he can chase his tail, while night blind can only run circles
and look stupid.
-- At LV1 can see message "You have become better at Swimming (101)" unlike
splashing around swimming skill (0) night blind.

I'm not really thinking about the KOS part too much, as seeing how most
others don't worry too much since Iksar forage can make up for most food
buying.  Does the advantages of being Iksar really far outweigh the night
blind...I mean...Humans?

(I'm joking so much about the bad night vision because my main character is
night blind (barbarian) and I didn't mention it earlier but I played a Human
Druid to LV1...I deleted it because I couldn't get out of the cave to Qeynos
Hills/Surefal Glade. I've also had to explain to newbies to sit and wait for
me in that same cave while I go get them a fire beetle eye.)


LV1 Iksar or Human Monk
LV19 Barbarian Warrior
LV12 Iksar Shadow Knight
LV15 Halfing Druid
LV17 Ogre Warrior
LV99 Ogre Druid, neg200 WIS, neg200 INT, constantly OOM, 100% fizzle rate,
selling ports to wizard portal of Luclin.
