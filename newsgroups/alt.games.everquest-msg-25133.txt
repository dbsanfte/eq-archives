    Most people that do the quest either use their tradeskill specialization
on Brewing, or have a friend who did that just to be a Ring quest
specialist. He should do it himself - he'll be asked on many raids to
Siren's Grotto if word gets out about his skill. ;-)

    You don't have to do that. Go to High Pass, Kith zone-in. At the first
bridge, cross the bridge, then go into the big wooden building that's on the
lake on the other side. Welcome to Brewing Heaven. If you go right from the
main door, the vendor you see sells all the basic brewing components (yeast,
hops etc.) If you go left, you see the brew cask. The bartender in the room
sells all the basic drinks, bottles, casks etc. Behind him is a staircase
up. At the top is a vendor that sells all the special drinks required to
make Fay Shakers. ;-) The only time you'll EVER need to leave that building
is if you require flasks of water - had you not crossed the bridge, and
instead followed the path towards High Keep, the first building you come to
contains a vendor with flasks of water.

>I think I have the highest tradeskills in my guild.

    I've always loved doing tradeskills. Smithing 179, Pottery 188, Brewing
189, Fletching 102, Jewelcraft 106, Baking 156, Tailoring 149. I'm thinking
of doing the Shawl when I hit 60 - I'd need to raise Fletching and JC. I'm
in the process of capping Tailoring on Wu's anyways - my WAR which camps the
AC in Upper Guk does silk runs now and then. I also want to cap Baking on
chocolate goods - and someone still owes me brownie parts. ;-)
