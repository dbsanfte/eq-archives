Erm? Sorry cant agree with that. The PoK book adds extra zone line to
cross to get to vendors (GD to Thurg is one line; as opposed to GD to PoK
to the nearby Nexus stone to either SH or Bazaar/ or from PoK to
further away stone for town of choice is another one at least on top of
any needed to get to) without the benefit of friendly guards to take the
heat off you while you leg it to the book in the first place. Not to
mention that the zone back in may have plenty of unpleasantness associated
if someone has legged it recently whereas the guards around Thurg will
butcher any train that is incoming.

And the spires is not a place to plonk down and dive to the moon becuase
it fires infrequently compared to crossing a zone line, has no guards and
is in range of a significant amount of mob paths.

All this means a city that you can just nip up to is extremely handy to
have around. Thurg happens to fit the bill for most very very nicely.
