since last patch i experience lots of problems losing sight of large
buildings or objects and players or NPC's too. 
No it has nothing to do with plane clip .. i see distant objects and
dont see closer ones.
As i move closer to items from a long distance they dissapear and
reappear as i get closer to.
When i turn slightly left or right they do the same
dissapear-reappear.
Also in toon selection screen as they rotate screen goes black in a
certain direction with only the light from weapons displayed 
Ialso started suddenly NOT receiving faction hits messages or even
experience messages! and i dont know what else i was (or still i am)
missing. reboot didnt solve this problem.
I tried to turn on/off the filters for all these messages in my main
chat etc but no result .. the messages appeared once or twice and then
i lost them again.. 
Very annoying situation.. can make EQ unplayable.

Does anyone has same problems or can help please?
