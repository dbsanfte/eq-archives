It shouldn't take anything near that much to reach 175 skill here's a repost
of an Ogre skilling to 175 skill in 375 pp

Follows is a very detailed journal of blacksmithing by Toadstomp
Squishgood, Level 30 Ogre Warrior of the Luclin server.

Please note that I made some serious (embarrassingly so) errors in
calculations in my previous version, and have revised pretty much the whole
thing.  This time I am showing all of my work.

The following costs for items I have blacksmithed are obtained by muling
with level 1 enchanters with maxed out charisma.  Ogre charisma -
Toadstomp's is 37 - and faction are simply too low to be purchasing
blacksmithing supplies with.

Cost of each Item purchased from vendors:

small piece of ore: 0.052pp
flask of water: 0.010pp
Lantern Casing Mold: 0.152pp
Bottle: 0.05pp
Skewer Mold: 0.084pp
Pot Mold: 0.367pp
Standing Legs Mold: 0.157pp
Smoker Base Mold: 0.315pp
Smoker Support Mold: 0.105pp
Thimble Mold: 0.189pp
Needle Mold: 0.189pp
Sheet of metal: 1.050pp (cheaper to buy than to make)
Guantlet Mold (for banded): 0.315pp
Cloak Sectional Mold (for banded): 1.260pp

Costs of each attempt to make an item:

Metal bits: 0.114pp
Toolbox: 0.124pp
Lantern: 0.281pp
Skewer: 0.208pp
Pot: 0.648pp
Small sewing kit: 0.502pp
Smoker: 0.752pp
Sheet of metal: 1.150pp (assuming no failures! So just buy them!)
Banded Guantlets: 2.425pp
Banded Cloak: 3.370pp

Following are my smithing attempts.  Note that cost of each step takes into
account materials that were made in previous attempts, so for example step
3 was very cheap because it used the bits made in steps 1 and 2, and all I
had to purchase was water.

The following attempts up to skill level 129 were done with Strength at
155, WIS 67, INT 64.

Metal bit attempt cost: 0.114pp
1. 40 bit attempts = 21 bits and skill to 13.  Cost: 4.560pp
2. 40 bit attempts = 24 bits and skill to 21  Cost: 4.560pp

Metal bits trivialed at 21 in 61 non-trivial attempts for a cost of 9.120pp.

Toolbox attempt minus metal bit cost: 0.010pp
3. 45 toolbox attempts = 18 toolboxes and skill to 30.  Cost: 0.450pp
4. 80 bit attempts = 58 bits.  Cost: 9.120pp
5. 58 toolbox attempts = 32 toolboxes and skill to 35  Cost: 0.580pp
6. 80 bit attempts = 64 bits  Cost: 9.120pp
7. 64 toolbox attempts = 33 toolboxes and skill to 50.  Cost: 0.640pp
8. 80 bit attempts = 78 bits  Cost: 9.120pp
9. 5 toolbox attempts = 4 toolboxes and skill to 51.  Cost: 0.050pp
10.  Sold 87 toolboxes to vendor for 0.100pp each.  Gain: 8.700pp

Toolboxes trivialed at 51 in 172 non-trivial attempts and a cost of 20.38pp.
Total cost of blacksmithing so far: 29.500pp.

Lantern attempt minus metal bit cost: 0.167pp
11. 13 lantern attempts = 7 large lanterns and skill to 56.  Cost: 2.171pp
12. 20 lantern attempts = 8 large lanterns and skill to 59.  Cost: 3.340pp
13. 40 lantern attempts = 23 large lanterns and skill to 67.  Cost: 6.680pp
14. 10 bit attempts = 10 bits.  Cost: 1.140pp
15. 10 lantern attempts = 1 large lantern and skill to 68.  Cost: 1.67pp
16.  Sold 39 lanterns to vendor for 0.238pp each.  Gain: 9.282pp

Lanterns trivialed at 68 in 83 non-trivial attempts and a cost of 5.719pp.
Total cost of blacksmithing so far: 35.219pp

Skewer attempt minus metal bit cost: 0.094pp
Smoker attempt minus metal bit and skewer cost: 0.430pp
Pot attempt minus metal bit cost: 0.534pp
17. 160 bit attempts = 153 bits.  Cost: 18.240pp
18. 64 skewer attempts = 23 skewers, skill to 79.  Cost: 6.016pp
19. 64 skewer attempts = 28 skewers, skill to 89.  Cost: 6.016pp
20. 32 bit attempts = 32 bits.  Cost: 3.648pp
21. 64 skewer attempts = 38 skewers, skill to 101.  Cost: 6.016pp
22. 64 bit attempts = 63 bits.  Cost: 7.296pp
23. 63 skewer attempts = 52 skewers, skill to 114.  Cost: 5.922pp
24. 14 bit attempts = 14 bits.  Cost: 1.596pp
25. Sold 131 skewers to vendor for 0.190pp each.  Gain: 24.890pp
26. 10 smoker attempts = 7 smokers, no skill increase.  Cost: 4.300pp
27. Sold 7 smokers to vendor for 0.695pp each.  Gain: 4.865pp
28. 4 pot attempts = 4 pots, no skill increase.  Cost: 2.136pp
29. Sold 4 pots to vendor for 0.648pp each.  Gain: 2.592pp

Note: I included those smokers and pots at the end because they used up the
last of the metal bits and skewers I made in this step, and it makes the
accounting so much easier.

Skewers almost trivialed at 114 (they trivial at 115) in 269 non-trivial
attempts for a cost of 82.983pp.
Total cost of blacksmithing so far: 118.202pp.

Pot attempt minus metal bit cost: 0.534pp
30. 32 bit attempts = 31 bits.  Cost: 3.648pp
31. 31 pot attempts = 24 pots, skill to 118.  Cost: 16.554pp
32. 32 bit attempts = 30 bits.  Cost: 3.648pp
33. 30 pot attempts = 22 pots and skill to 121.  Cost: 16.020pp
34. Sold 46 pots to vendor for 0.648pp each.  Gain: 29.808pp

Pots trivialed at 121 in 61 non-trivial attempts for a cost of 10.062pp.
Total cost of blacksmithing so far: 128.264pp.

Sewing kit attempt minus metal bit cost: 0.388pp
35. 31 bit attempts = 31 bits.  Cost: 3.534pp
36. 31 sewing kit attempts = 13 sewing kits, skill to 124.  Cost: 12.028pp
37. 32 bit attempts = 32 bits.  Cost: 3.648pp
38. 32 sewing kit attempts = 18 sewing kits, skill to 129.  Cost: 12.416pp
39. Sold 31 sewing kits to vendor for 0.524pp each.  Gain: 16.244pp

At this point Toadstomp took a long sabbatical from smithing.  He got his
East and West Freeport faction up to dubious, so he can now smith there,
though he still cannot actually buy there.  With his CHA at 28, it is best
that he uses the usual enchanter mule for purchasing anyway.

As he worked his way up to level 30, Toadstomp was careful to save
otherwise useless pieces of armor and weapons that gave Strength bonuses
where he normally had none.  With his special smithing suit on, Toadstomp
now has a STR of 182, a WIS of 67, and INT of 64.

40. 60 bit attempts = 55 bits.  Cost: 6.84pp
41. 48 sewing kit attempts = 36 sewing kits, skill to 135.  Cost: 18.624pp
42. Sold 48 sewing kits to vendor for 0.524pp each.  Gain: 25.152pp
43. Sold 7 metal bits to vendor for 0.076pp each.  Gain: 0.532pp

Sewing kits trivialed at 135 in 111 non-trivial attempts for a cost of
18.162pp.
Total cost of blacksmithing so far: 146.426pp.

Banded Guantlets attempt cost: 2.425pp.
44. 8 Guantlet attempts = 7 Guantlets and skill to 136.  Cost: 19.400pp
45. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 9 Guantlets and skill to 138.  Cost: 38.800pp
46. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 8 Guantlets and skill to 142.  Cost: 38.800pp
47. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 11 Guantlets and skill to 143.  Cost: 38.800pp
48. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 13 Guantlets and skill to 145.  Cost: 38.800pp

56. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 13 Guantlets and skill to 163.  Cost: 38.800pp
57. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 14 Guantlets and skill to 164.  Cost: 38.800pp
58. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 14 Guantlets, no skill increase.  Cost: 38.800pp
59. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 16 Guantlets and skill to 165.  Cost: 38.800pp
60. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 11 Guantlets and skill to 166.  Cost: 38.800pp
61. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 15 Guantlets and skill to 167.  Cost: 38.800pp
62. 16 Gauntlet attempts = 15 Guantlets, no skill increase.  Cost: 38.800pp

66. Sold 273 Guantlets to vendor for 2.190pp each.  Gain: 597.87pp

"/auction SELLING 273 medium banded guantlets, 7pp each!"
Didn't sell a single one.  Imagine that.

Banded Guantlets trivialed at 168 in 336 non-trivial attempts for a cost of
216.93pp.
Cost of blacksmithing so far: 363.356pp.

Banded Cloak attempt cost: 3.370pp.
67. 16 Cloak attempts = 12 Cloaks and skill to 170.  Cost: 53.920pp
68. 16 Cloak attempts = 15 Cloaks and skill to 172.  Cost: 53.920pp
69. 16 Cloak attempts = 16 Cloaks and skill to 173.  Cost: 53.920pp
70. 16 Cloak attempts = 15 Cloaks and skill to 174.  Cost: 53.920pp
71. 16 Cloak attempts = 16 Cloaks and skill to 175.  Cost: 53.920pp
72. Sold 72 Cloaks to vendor for 3.429pp each.  Gain: 253.746pp

Banded Cloaks trivialed at 175 in 80 non-trivial attempts for a cost of
15.854pp.
Total cost of blacksmithing from 0 to 175: 379.21pp.

This concludes my report of blacksmithing from 0 to 175.  After this comes
plate armor smithing, and that will be a completely different sort of
report.
