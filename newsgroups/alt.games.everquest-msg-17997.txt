As a druid, you'll be annoyed starting at level 14 by a constant hail
of people you aren't grouped with asking you to cast SOW on them.
This will step up drastically at level 29 when they start asking you
to port them around Norrath.

Clerics, on the other hand, won't have to suffer much  till 39 when
their first EXP restoring res spell comes on line.

And watch for that annoyance factor to skyrocket again when I
hit 49 and get the 90% res instead of the 50% res junior I've been
casting.
