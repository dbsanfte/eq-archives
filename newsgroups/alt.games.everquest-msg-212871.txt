Its a chat channel, but anyone on any server can join it.  Like all "serverwide"
channels, you join by typing serverwide.name:password, in this case the name of the
channel is age, and as with most generic channels, the password is the same as the
name of the channel, age again.

age, if you didn't reason that out, is an acronym for alt.games.everquest

Like all chat channels, you'll be able to see everything anyone says in it once you
join, and can talk to it by starting your lines with /#, where the number is the
number of the chat channel you want to talk to; if its the only one you are in, then
you'll use /1.

So
/join serverwide.age:age
/1 I'm a little teapot short and stout

You can also get a list of everyone in the channel by typing /list, you won't be able
to see their classes or levels, but you will see which server each person is on, if
there's no server name next to someone they are on your server, and a /who all name
will give you more information
