The hammer is going to take longer than a gate potion probably, because
it takes a combat proc, and from what I hear it doesn't proc very often
& it has a huge delay.  It lands you in a boat I understand and usually
you won't be attacked but once in awhile you might.

AFAIK there is no way to raise OT faction.  Bards & Enchanters (maybe
necros) can charm the skelly you get it from, but you can't get it that
way unless you are the charmer.  

You are probably better off just getting your pottery up and making the
thurg gate potions, which are pretty easy.  At least a hell of a lot
cheaper than using shaman gate potions.
