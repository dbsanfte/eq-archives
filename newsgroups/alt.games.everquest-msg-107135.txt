Kickass method and explaination there Arolpin, I set it up last night and
had no problem at all twisting 3 songs whilst fighting mobs solo. Once it
becomes second nature I will try instrument swapping and then finally
grouping ; )

I set the 1-8's up on the second hot key panel, with 1-4 doubled up on the
first one (plus a 5th straight song to use as a <stop> button), that way I
could keep both mellee slots and a backpack on the first hot key panel and
keep the spellbook and persona there at the bottom as well.

Very easy, quite shockingly so after battling with the "pause, hit, short
pause, hit" routine for every single song.

Thanks a heap!
