I don't have the books myself for making the components.  So I could possibly
be wrong, but thats how I understand it.

For my own experiences, I mined tier 1 utnil I got up to 40 skill in all
areas...  50 in half of them, since trapping took longer.  In that time, I
pulled up 140 pieces of tin.   And one piece of copper.

The copper is the rare metal gather for tier 1.  It's the only rare that I got
(that I know of) for any of the materials.  I didn't get the rare gem, or the
rare roots, or the rare wood, even though I gathered just as much.
