Yes and no.  Cannibalize is like Lich as a Nuke is like a DOT.  Both the latter
do damage and give you mana, but in different ways.  Hmm, better, its similar
to the difference between a heal and regen.  Canni is a single shot of damage
that gives you a shot of mana.  Lich is a steady ongoing drain on hp that gives
a steady flow of mana similar to the Clarity line (but generally more mana per
tic than comperable clarities).

Canni has an advantage over Lich in that the degree to which you are using it
can be easily controlled; if you are low on HP or taking a lot of damage from a
mob, you just stop canni-ing so much; if you are particularly LOM you can speed
up canni to boost mana faster.  But Lich is steady and doesn't require any
work, plus its easier to sit and Lich up... a shaman, to be truely effective,
has to be working all the time.

The dance isn't quite as hard as it sounds on first blush, its simple enough to
make a hotkey which stands you up, casts the spell, and sits you back down when
its done, so its only one keystroke every 6 seconds.  If you've ever run a
bard, you'll laugh at the idea that thats a lot of work.  If you've ever run a
cleric, you'll be bemused by how much faster shaman get mana back using this
technique.

Oddly, this stuff about canni apparantly isn't well known.  I was in a odd sort
of group in OT today with my mage, two shaman, two bards, my mage, and a
ranger.  Whenever anyone had to log we replaced them with the same class for
the most part (ranger was a rogue originally...)  So we went thru about 6
shaman over the course of the evening.  One of the six used cannidance, and one
other used canni occaisionally.  Two more, I taught the wonders of
cannidancing, and the other two never did catch on.  It was very noticable
which were which, the ones that had 100% hp and were crying out for mana
breaks, versus the ones that laughed when the ranger would beg for the same.  I
was puller, and I tried to keep at least 4 mobs in camp at all times, 2 bard
pets and 2 being killed, plus me kiting a couple more behind me waiting for
them to peel them off.  We were extremely busy, constantly, for about an hour
at a time... or when we had the non canni shaman, we'd go thru a dozen or two
mobs and then have to sit for several minutes.  When it was a cannidancer and a
more healthy shaman, the cannidancer was doing more of the healing and yet
doing almost all the buffing.
