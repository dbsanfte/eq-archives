Ah, sorry, I meant to specify "quad kiting".  (I tried to do some of
that at 14, but there's no good AE spell for it.  Invoke Lightning
seems too small, and Cascade of Hail is a "rain" spell which means
it tends not to do full damage unless the mobs are stationary.  It's
a fine thing to have memmed when grouping in case of an overpull,
but I've never gotten it to work "on the run".)

I guess I could do kiting on single targets, but it seems to take
forever, and I have trouble judging how far to run before pausing to
nuke it again.  (I should probably get an Extended Range item; I have
Spell Haste but the mob still seems to reach me a bit too often.)  So
I usually end up meleeing while throwing in whatever spells I can get
through the interrupts.

That's when soloing, of course.  Kiting while grouped is a different
kettle of fish!  (My monk grouped once with a druid who did a great
job of kiting mobs in circles so I could stand in place, turning to
stay facing the mob while pounding at it.)

That said, the ability to "catch the tick" for mana regen while
running from even a single mob would be useful.

Hm, so presumably you watch for the bar to move so you know a tick
has just gone by, and that's when you start the 4-count, then sit
for two seconds to catch the tick, and set off again.  Seems like
you'd be running at only 2/3 speed or less, but I suppose with SOW
and Snare that can be enough.

Is there a /run or /autorun text command?  If so, you could put it
all in a hotkey and tune the timing a bit more.

I didn't realise the max damage part, but figured I was an easier
target in some way or other.  (The term "sitting duck" comes to
mind. :-)  No, the way I sometimes try it in melee is when I'm in
a group, if I'm contributing melee DPS, I'd like to step back out
of range and sit for the tick, then step forward again and resume
melee.
