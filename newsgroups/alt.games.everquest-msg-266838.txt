They do make a noticeable difference for me.  Not much of one, but they are 
faster.  An easy test.  Find a straight line that you can run in a safe zone 
and time your run from one end of the zone to another without the Jboots. 
Then time it again with the jboots.  On most zones, you should see the 
difference.

Though it's too late for your character, I'd also advise against redeeming 
the Jboots for any scout character.  The scout pathfinding ability gives a 
bigger speed boost.
