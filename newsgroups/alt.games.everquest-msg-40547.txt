I'm all for knowledgeable CS people.  I personally haven't had any trouble
with the much talked about ignorant EQ CS: in the 2.5 years since launch, I've
/petitioned a total of 3 times with CS related concerns (and was satisfied
each time).  I don't know why some people seem to live in the petition queue.
EQ CS is out of sight, out of mind 99.9999% of the time for me (and most
others).  At any rate, I hope Tweety does well at her new job, I really did
enjoy her rants, but I still can't believe they hired her.  And don't think
for a second that she will learn every intracacy of every aspect of the
game--that cannot be done with games that are this large.

Good humored stuff is entertaining, sure.  Like the Mozilla toy that the
Netscape people put on Microsoft's lawn.  But I'm afraid that Mythic is going
to do stuff that specifically targets EQ, and will ruin their game in the
process.  (Just a fear!  No idea if it'll be true!  The Tweety hiring makes me
uneasy though.)

An example is the no xp loss beyond level.  That, to me, seems to deal
directly with EQ players' complaints that death penalty is too severe.
Several have already pointed out *serious* exploits of this that occur in AO.
The same code would be disastrous in EQ, and it may be disastrous in DAoC.  If
they make the game too easy, IT WILL FAIL.  Look at AC.  Maybe not a total
failure, but pretty damn insignificant compared to EQ.  They better not lose
sight of their own vision in the quest to one-up EQ.

I'm sure you're right.  Ad banners turned out to be little more than an
elaborate pyramid scheme.

Eh, you have a strange definition of "communicate well".  She had some
entertaining rants -- that does not equate to being a good PR person.  She
will *need* to tote the company line, or she will be fired.  She will *need*
to do so in a professional and courteous manner, or she will be flamed
mercilessly *then* fired.  Hopefully their interview process convinced them
that she will be able to fill the job competently, and the decision went
beyond "Let's get this high profile EQ-basher to work for us!  Wahoo!"

Mythic hired Lum also, right?  I see a disturbing pattern emerging.
