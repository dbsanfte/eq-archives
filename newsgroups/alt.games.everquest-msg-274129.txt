Someone who top posts.  :b

When you place your reply above what you are responding to, that is 
topposting, that is frowned upon in this, and many other, newsgroups.

As to the whole argument about selling accounts, not interested in getting 
into it.  At least you do realize you are violating the EULA.  Now you also 
likely understand why it is an iffy propostion for anyone to purchase an 
account, as there is always the possibility of losing that account at any 
time.
