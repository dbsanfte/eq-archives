That's because to prove something illegal merely requires citing a single
law that it violates.  It's much harder to prove that something is legal.

Violating contracts is not illegal.  In fact, one of the reasons that there
are generally no punative damages for breaking contracts is to avoid
discouraging people from breaking contracts in cases where it would be
economically better for the contract to be broken.
