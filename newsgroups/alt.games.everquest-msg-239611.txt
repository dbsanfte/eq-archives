This  is  a  weak analogy, but  Darth Vader DID bring  balance  to the
force... just like he was "prophecied to do" 

And yes, hitler changed things. If it weren't for him, for example,
China would still br a Monarchy. And yes, I'm glad he  ended up dead
in  a bunker. Too bad  it couldn't have happened BEFORE he caused
millions to lose their lives...

And Hitler was  more  charismatic  than intelligent... but I
digress...
