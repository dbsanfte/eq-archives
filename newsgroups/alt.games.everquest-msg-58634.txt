yes, you did the exact right thing. Even when you go link dead if you
are moving forward auto run your character continues to move forward.
Due to that happening, moving forward while losing connection, you
kept running until the game shut your character down and you lived. 

So if you are in a similar situation just start autorunning in a
direction, if you are lucky the server will have caught that you
started running and you will come back alive.
