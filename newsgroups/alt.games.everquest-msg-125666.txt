Ive played in "worlds" where (to use your example) as a druid I would have
to run around charming animals over and over as nauseum. Or enchanters who
do nothing but sit in the one spot casting the same enchant spell over and
over and over.
Progression then is merely a matter of how long you are prepared to sit at
the keyboard.

Oh wait... thats that we have now anyway so maybe its not such a bad idea.
