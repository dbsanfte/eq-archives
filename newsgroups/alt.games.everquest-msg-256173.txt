As a 65 cleric with 108 aa's in a family guild, no it's not required.
I get by quite sufficiently without it.

I can rez a whole group from the mana I have before I rez myself after a
wipe.  Then I use my Divine Rez ability after I've looted my body minus one
item and I'm FH and FM gtg.  HoV the group and I'm 60m-ish and we're away.
No waiting, no medding. Piece of cake.

I'm in exactly the same boat as you and unless you are doing lots of small
guild raids, you don't need your epic.  If by any chance you're the only
cleric left alive, just rez another cleric as your first rez. /shrug.

Never had anyone in my guild complain.  They know how much I hate quests and
tradeskilling and respect that. (As you know, not everyone loves that sort
of thing)  :P

I've had a few offers to help me get my epic mind you and even got Lord
Gimblox's ring when I gave in in a moment of weakness.... however.... can't
see myself ever finishing it. I just don't need it and the camps!! Sheesh.
Helped a fellow guildy camp shards once and if I ever see Skyfire again,
it'll be too soon.
