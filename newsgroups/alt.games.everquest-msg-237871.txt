How do you then explain the randomness inherent in these rules?
Nevermind, I'm guessing "rules we don't understand yet".

And I guess all living things would just be DNA propagating machines,
always eating and drinking and mating and moving in the exact way that
would let them propagate the most, and that there would be only one
such optimal way and it would be blindingly obvious every single time.
If the right choice is that simple and obvious, I guess they don't
need free will and don't need thought processes, either. There'd  be
no evolution either, as every mutation is a non perfect DNA
propagation (unless the mutation were preordained by the Rules of the
Universe, of course)

Your god must be a very busy person, having to make sure nothing EVER
makes a choice of any kind unless he lets it.
