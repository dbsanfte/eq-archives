I stopped buffing my pets after the 3rd griffawn ate me for lunch. 
Sometimes it works to buff them sometimes it doesn't.  You gotta decide 
when it's better not to buff them.

When you were running, the hermit warped to you, sometimes that happens 
if you hesitate before you are out of thier radius.  If you do get far 
enough away, sometimes you can lose them but if you get anywhere near 
them before you zone out or camp and come back they will chomp you with 
no warning.   I've never camped the hermit, so I don't know the strategy 
for killing him.

Better luck next time, at least you survived.
