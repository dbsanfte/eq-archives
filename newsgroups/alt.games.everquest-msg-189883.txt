What a damn minute!  Are you actually complaining that enchanters,
part of the EQ holy trinity, don't add enough to group situations?

Do me a favor and type "/ all enchanter lfg"
Then type "/ all mage lfg"
...or "/ all ranger lfg"
...or "/ all wizard lfg"
...or most other classes

Wow...and I thought we rangers complained too much about not getting
groups.
