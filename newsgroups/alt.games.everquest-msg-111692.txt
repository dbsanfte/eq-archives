I became an officer in an established guild and we do not have a problem
passing out loot.  We have an epic help system based on how many times
you've helped on others epics and it seems to be working.  In standard
raids, we praise the creator of the /random hotkey.  We will assign everyone
who wants it a number /1 guildy1  2/guildy2, etc. and do a /random 1 5 (or
however many) and the number that comes up is the winner.  End of story.
And it is on a "Can and will use" method, if it's for an alt, you're sol.
We don't twink our new members, but you're free to twink your own alts.

I do often have PLENTY of time to do my own thing.  Perhaps it's because
we're just not that huge like some guilds.  I do occasionally get tells
asking for help, because i help often, not necessarily because i'm an
officer.  Again, perhaps it's because I am not a "senior" officer.  They do
seem to be very busy most nights, but I have seen them happily playing their
alts or happily killing stuff on Luclin.

Hm, perhaps it's because the majority of our guild are mature people.
