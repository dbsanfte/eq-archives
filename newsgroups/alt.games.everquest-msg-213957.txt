Edit the file in Notepad.  Insert funny characters.  Save, selecting the
option to save in UTF-8 instead of ASCII.

For the "insert funny characters" part, there's a character map accessory
that will let you pick the funny characters from a palette.  I forget where
this is, since it is in different places on different Windows versions, and
my Windows machine is not booted at the moment.
