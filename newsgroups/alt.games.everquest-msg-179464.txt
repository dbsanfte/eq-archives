Fanboy speak, hmm? How so? Tell me, what insider information do you
have on the costs of running 20+ server FARMS 24/7 and paying salaries
of coders and technical staff, not to mention the other usual expenses
with running a business... Anyone who denies that the cost of running
the game has at LEAST tripled since they started out is a fucking
moron, plain and simple.
