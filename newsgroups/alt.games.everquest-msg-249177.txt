Well I have been reading here for awhile now and thought I would post this
cause I find it very SOE like.

The steps leading up the erudin after the TP pad have had the same 2d rock
wall glitch since I started playing in 2001. Its on the left side of the
stairs going up. When you look up the stairs from the bottom there is a
piece of rock that sticks out at a 45deg angle. Go up to the top and look
down well its gone... Been annoying me for years.


I was wondering if anyone else knows of anymore oddities like that?
