Hi all,

I've been venturing farther and farther to see new parts of Norath,
and yesterday wandered into Upper Guk. There was this wonderfully slow
croc that conned blue to me and I thought about picking it off, but I
was wondering if the Frogloks consider the crocs in their dungeon as
their pets?

Should I attack it, will they go agro on me? So far, they ignore me,
and from what I understand will continue to ignore me no matter where
I wander in Guk, as long as I don't kill a single Froglok.
