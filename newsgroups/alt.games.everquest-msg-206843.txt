The chanter will not get any exp.

Basically for a low-level to earn experience the highest level character
in a group should be no more than (lowest level*3)/2 rounded up. The
rules are more flexible in the low levels but a level 30 SK is well
beyond the point where the lowest*3/2 rule initially applies.

Your chanter wil need to be level 20 or so before grouping with the SK
becomes viable.
