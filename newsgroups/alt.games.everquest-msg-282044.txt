They could code mob AI to make trains less likely or reduce with distance run.
The real reason to go with a discrete-zone implementation is for partitioning
across servers.  Having an explicit load step when your game is handed from
one SoE host machine to another is just easier to code.

There are ways around this as well, and I can only assume SoE didn't want to
spend the engineering time needed to avoid the visibility of zone changes.
The bonus of lazy game design (not having to make better mob AI to deal with a
very large pathable area) I expect is secondary to them.
