I don't think there is a decent analogy out there. The goods they are trying
to sell, only exist as code on a computer. There doesn't seem to be a
victim, inasmuch as the company doesn't seem to have made any financial or
material loss. They have exactly the same control over any item that is
sold, as they did before it was sold.

Someone pointed out earlier in the thread that if someone gives you an item,
that is ok. If you later give him a few bucks for his time, then that is ok.
If you auction the stuff on a website, that is not ok.... so where does the
line get drawn?

Seems to me that the Sony's policy of selling items is unenforceable, and
therefore they make no effort to enforce it, unless it is thrust under their
noses.
