In EQL, you were often left with no choice but to go to a spoiler site, 
as the information provided in the quest is (choose one or more) 
inaccurate, misleading, nonexistant.  I am still withholding judgement on 
EQ2, but so far, I think it's a nice balance on most of the quests.  It 
does not give away everything, but, it does generally give you enough 
information to figure it out.
