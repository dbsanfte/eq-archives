Thanks for posting this, I wasnt aware of this. *makes a note not to buy
SoL*
What the hell is wrong with high levels farming items and selling then to
lower levels... it how I got a lot of my items at lower levels and I was
glad they were for sale. If verant have a problem with too many items
getting on the market and drivin the price down, well maybe if the vendors
bought items at a sensible price, there might be less in circulation. Its a
band aid solution for a problem that should never occur.

I think Verant are kidding themselves about the long term appeal of the
game. If I were them, id be thinking more about the short term, and selling
*this* expansion. EQ is getting dated. In a year or so it will be "old".
Thats just the way things go.
