Ahh the hole.

Best way to deal with the Hole: Go to character creation, make a Haffer
rouge that worships .. oh guys help me out here, starts with a b (been too
long).

you should be able to sneak/hide from the main zone entrance (down by that
pool behind the locked door. You can squeeze through the crack above it with
some work).

His corpse should be gettable without trouble. You will have to kill
yourself at least once to get it out, so make sure someone binds you
outside.

Or get a necro to do it.

There are some serious mean elementals down there so unless you are ready to
do a combat drop with say a DA bard or three, I wouldn't go in that way.
