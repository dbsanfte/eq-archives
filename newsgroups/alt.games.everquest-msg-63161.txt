You will go to one of the wizard spires scattered around the land, and every
45 minutes or so a scripted event will take place and you will get a
confirmation to port to Luclin.

Castable Luclin ports will only work from places inside Luclin, and old world
ports will only work from the old world.  They have said taking an old world
port while in Luclin will take you to the gateway zone, where you have to wait
for the event, then port again once in the old world.
