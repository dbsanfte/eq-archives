They are working correctly as far as I know, but they do need tuning.
I've only tried one task, which sent me into droga to kill goblins that were
dark blue at 66. I could handle it easily as a well geared bard, but a non-
soloing class would have had serious problems killing them. The reward of exp
and coin for completing a task is underwhelming and it is not worth your while
at least at higher levels.
