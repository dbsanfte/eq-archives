Dont know the price level on FV, but on Veeshan i payed 4K for it, and 
im REALLY happy i did.
Im mainly a soloing druid, and for soloing its absolutely useless, and i 
wondered why i ever wasted 4K on the spell.

Then i grouped with some guildied in AC, and found out the spell are 
brilliant in groups. The spells cost 332 mana to cast, so a little more 
than your normal DD (in my case its Scoriae with 688 dmg for 250 mana). 
But its a rain spell, so do 3 waves of 490 dmg, so if none of the waves 
are resisted, were talking 1470 dmg for only 332 mana.

To use the spell effectively you need the following:
Be sure if AoEs are usefull in the area you fight in BEFORE casting. 
This spell paired with places like KK can prove to be deadly to the group.
Mob need to have good aggro on tank in question. Since its rain spell, 
it hit an area, no good if mob charge you after first hit, then th 2 
next waves wont hit. If mob move around, then spell is wasted.
Preferably more than 1 mob, although the dmg/mana ratio are nice on 1 
mob, doing a total of 2940 dmg with 332 mana are a nice feeling.
And last, be SURE youre a good distance from your target before you 
cast. Its a rain spell, so you will take dmg if youre in range of the 
spell. Group members wont get hit.

Can reccomend the spell in AC and Akheva. In AC the grimlings arent that 
resistant to fire, so great there.

In Akheva the centi guys are great targets. Some of them are highly 
magic resistant (hard to snare too), and spells are hard to land. Its a 
waste of time on those, just heal and DS the main tank. But for the 
stupid little centis, this spell are great, hit for full over 90% of the 
time, and half the resists are partial resists. Best is that a good 
group can pull 2 centis at a time and keep them aggroed on tank, so you 
can hit them both with the spell.
