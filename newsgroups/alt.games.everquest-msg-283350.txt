 Play one or two months then take a few off. My ex stopped playing EQ
for the same reason and after 3 months (roughly) got a free 30 days,
TWICE. 5-7 months straight then stopped for 3 months, got the free 30
days, played for like 2 months, stopped for another 3 and got 30 more
days. Stupid me has been playing with less than a 2 month gap
inbetween. If I can just managed to make it to July 4th maybe...

 Thats the addiction. I'll bad mouth the people playing (they deserve
it trust me), Soe's CSR, and the programmers\delevelopers and I still
love the damn game. If I hated it I wouldn't bother even complaining
about it. 

 There is a EQEmulator around. Its looks like a PitA to set up and
maintain, not to mention its against the EULA.
