You are correct in one thing.  It is the thought behind the words.  "Plz" is a
cursory attempt at sounding polite.  Typing out the entire word says to me "I am
inconvinencing you, however, I will also take time out of my day to spell out
what I am asking"

In general, I take at least 5 seconds to formulate a SoW request.  Since that is
the time it takes for the spell to cast.  Here is an example...

"Pardon me good Shaman/Druid/Ranger, but would you please take a moment to imbue
me with a wolf spirit?"

Contrast this to...

"Can I have a Spirit of Wolf plz?"

See the difference?  It isn't being anal retentive.  It is respecting the person
you are asking.
