Which is a one group easy as pie encounter.  I'm talking mostly about the 
General fight, which is a special encounter.  On the other hand, PoA and 
Chardok Royals are raid force encounters in which multiple classes pieces 
drop... so you are more easily able to garner that raid level force to go 
in and do it. My point being, it's a trade off.

I didn't say it was a player only epic... no epic is that I can think of 
off the top of my head.  I said the fight only benefits the rogue (iow, 
only benefits the rogue epic.
