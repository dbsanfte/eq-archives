Ultima Online had that.  You could tell where the server boundaries were,
because mobs got hung up on it in thier wandering, or having been trained
there... so there was usually several sitting at the boundary between two
server sections.

Horizons was seemless.  The only zoning would be if you use the in game
teleporters between the major cities, otherwise you went from section to
section without stops to load.

UO used the "no zoning" approach as well, although I think it may have taken
a few seconds when you walked into a dungeon, it wasn't even close to the
"loading please wait" type of zone.  More like the screeen would freeze up
for 5 seconds or so.  (As I remember... it has been a long time since I
played)
