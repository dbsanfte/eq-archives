Yeah, I knew that, just and assumed you would figure out the gate out 
cast, rezone bit.  If you are just barely missing it, SoE may well work 
for you, in which case, just get that cast on you in PoK before heading 
out, it lasts long enough to not be an issue.  (Assuming you don't have a 
ranger or druid with you that can cast it.)
