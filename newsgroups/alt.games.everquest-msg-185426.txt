"Name police" can't be everywhere and see everyone. There are
characters who have made it to level 65 without ever seeing or talking
to a guide or GM... They *can't* catch them all without the player's
help... Oh, sure, they could sit and hop from zone to zone and do /who
checks, but then they'd never get any of their more important work
done.
