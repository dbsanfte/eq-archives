    It's not just loot. It's quests, too. If so-and-so asks me to kill 
Zabobtik Jones, how "worldly" is it if I get there and Zabobtik Jones is 
already dead with another group in line to kill him? "But, but, the mayor 
told ME to kill him!" "WTF, camped n00b."

    And with that statement, you lose all credibility as someone looking to 
design a MMORPG.

    Now, imagine Unrest with proper use of instancing. You enter the zone, 
open to everyone, same chaos swirling around as people fail to control their 
pulls. But for those brave few that fight their way into the mansion, 
adventure awaits. Behind a secret panel, a staircase leading down to an 
instance portal that takes you to the basement instance, and a fight with 
the dwarven ghost that haunts it. Venture up the stairs far enough, and you 
reach another instance portal, this one leading to the upper levels of 
Unrest and the beasts in the attic. Go down the well outside, and along a 
dank underground tunnel, and you reach a portal to the haunted underbelly of 
Unrest, filled with insects twisted by magic and the disturbed remains 
they've uncovered. Each of these three instances is designed to lead to 
specific boss encounters, for either quests or loot. The people in the main 
part of the zone are doing quests, too, and getting loot, but their loot is 
the "random 1/100 drop" kind and the quests are "collect 12 Death Beetle 
Antennae" types. People gather outside to help combat the vermin of Unrest 
and gain XP, but when the time comes for a band of heroes to combat the true 
terrors of the zone they go into instances where they fight not for XP but 
for quests, for loot, and for glory.

    That is what instancing promises. People meet up in the "general" part 
of the zone to fight and gain experience, and when they feel they can handle 
the challenge they venture in deeper to instances where they prove 
themselves and are rewarded appropriately. You still have the same 
interactivity for the "general" part of the game, yet the special feel that 
named mobs have isn't destroyed with camps or random pops. The Fell Ghoul 
beneath the mansion is in exactly the room someone imagined he would be in, 
with exactly the minions and treasures you'd think he'd have, and fighting 
to him is exactly the adventure one would expect.

    Destroys immersion. See above - I want to fight the Fell Ghoul in his 
lair, not in a_random_place05. What you describe is fine for semi-nameds 
like "A Really Large Death Beetle With Nasty, Sharp, Pointy Mandibles" but 
not for the true villains of the game. And games like this need true 
villains, mobs that players can say "I beat him" and feel a sense of 
accomplishment.
