Actually I'm pretty sure he isn't trying to say that folks who play
Quake shouldn't play EQ.  I think his point was that they shouldn't
approach EQ with a Quake mentality.  If that's not what he meant I'm
sure he will correct me, but if I've got it right it makes sense
actually.  Its not the people that are a problem, its the attitude.  In
Quake ( my god do you have any idea of how many times I've spelled that
Quack since I started this post?) the object is to dominate with your
"leet skillz" and proceed to make sure that everyone else in the arena
is made aware of that fact via the use of text and now sound aided text
macros that explain how much they suck(I am making some assumptions here
since I play UT rather than Quake, shoot me if I am mistaken<g>). 
Playing EQ with someone taking that approach is not only not fun, but
actually makes me want to go play Quake (did it again <EG>), or in my
case UT, even though I suck at those games, but at least I can shoot
them in the head once in a while.
