The two main gods in Freeport are Erolisi Marr, and Mithanial Marr.  I
believe Erolisi is aligned with Tunare, while Mithanial is at least
favorable towards her.  I had no problem bringing my Tunareite Half Elf
Paladin into Freeport.... except the time I accidentally discovered the
Shadow Knight guild.

Initially, they will all be indifferent to you.  If you're a Paladin or a
Cleric (which you aren't, since you're a Wood Elf), then you're bound to
start building bad faction against the Freeport Militia, and good faction
against the Knights of Truth.  Other "netural" classes can manage both
factions quite nicely, and even get warmly or better with both of them.

Paladins can expect to be KOS to the Militia somewhere around level 40, due
to killing Sir Lucan for the Soulfire quest.  Everyone over 40 in my guild
is KOS in East and West Freeport.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
