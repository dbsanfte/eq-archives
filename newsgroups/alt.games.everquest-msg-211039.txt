In the right situation I was soloing level 60 mobs with my Ranger at
59, and 62 mobs with him at 61.  I did it by snaring and arrow kiting
with some archery AA's.  It was really not even dangerous as long as
there was no lag...  But what happens when I try this on a mob that
nukes, snares, summons, roots, or cannot be pulled to an open area
where I will get no adds and can keep a safe distance?

Dead Ranger.

My point is that at some point in the game the differences in class
abilities as well as MOB specifics start affecting which kinds of mobs
you can be effective against.  Even up to level 60+, there are still
cases where a certain class has an ability that allows it to solo or
maybe duo a mob that is one or more levels higher, while other classes
would be worthless without a full group.

Does that mean that a necro that considers a lightcrawler in PoD
should get a different message than a paladin of the same level should
receive?  How would you code such system?
