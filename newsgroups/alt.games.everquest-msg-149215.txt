Nah we've passed up those kind of idiotic ages. I admit in a country
where we should be working on cleaner power sources and reducing waste
and such as well as modernizing our living spaces and commercial areas
half the stupid people would rather get instant messages of their god
damned cell phones than worry about any life improving stuff like
that. Though I have faith all those people will die eventually and
we'll get back to evolving.
