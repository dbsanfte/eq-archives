	No, because damage for bows is wonky and not calculated the same as damage
for other weapons.

	Your bow will show a damage bonus when rclicked, for instance, but as far
as I can tell it's calculated as if the bow were a 1H weapon, and it doesn't
matter anyway 'coz it doesn't seem to be added in.  (When you crit, everyone
sees the crit message with the base damage damage in parentheses.  Warriors
using melee weapons will then see the actual damage they did with the damage
bonus on their weapon.  When you crit with a bow, the two values are
identical.)

|1. AC

|
|5. Wisdom

	Swap WIS and DEX.
