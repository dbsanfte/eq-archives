Because the merchant is in that location on purpose.  Risk
and/or tedium is required to reach the merchant.

I recall finding an innkeeper standing at the entrance of
Befallen way back when I was a newbie; I was so
excited not to have to cross the strip of sand where
the HG roam in order to sell and restock with food
and drink!  Some enterprising soul had clearly attacked
him while under SOW and led him right to the zone
line to make life easier.  Very dissapointing to find
that he wouldn't deal with me.

In retrospect, though, no merchant would ever be
in their right spot if this sort of activity worked;
people would pull them all over the place for their
convenience.

The bug here is that the pulled merchants should
saunter back to their spawn spot instead of spending
hours or days out of position.
