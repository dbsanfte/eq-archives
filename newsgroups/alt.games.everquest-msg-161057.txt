I feel fairly confident in saying that the conversation you had with a
guide about your surname has no causal relationship to the fact that
your character is gone.  If there was a serious problem with either of
your names, they would have simply changed your name (generally after
offering you a chance to suggest a new one if you were online) and/or
removed your surname after offering a similar choice. They don't do
bannings and such generally over names.

Even if you had commited some *SERIOUSLY* heinous crime against
humanity, your fellow players, the GM, exploited, whatever... they
*still* wouldn't have deleted your character. They would have either
warned and blackmarked your account, suspended your account for some
short period of time, or deleted your account (and thereby, *ALL* your
characters and login ability) if it was really awful.

I expect that you are simply the victim of a bug, if one character is
missing. e-mailing Sony was the right thing to do, as long as you were
polite and professional about it. They should be able to restore the
character fairly quickly.
