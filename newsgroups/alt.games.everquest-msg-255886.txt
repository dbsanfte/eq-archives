Its not a bias when you correct your sample set for errors.

Your suggestion essentially says, lets take a group of longtime and 
competent players and compare them to a group composed of a mix of 
competent players, complete newbies, preteens, people who play once a 
month, and their spouses...

-That's- a biased proposition.

I'm suggesting we compare:

1) competent players who raid 

against

2) competent players who do not raid (specifically those who are coming 
up against the blocks imposed by raid requirements).

That's a far more fair comparison, imo.
