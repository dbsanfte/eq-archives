What you are saying does not validate me as full of shit. 
Yes at one time there was 400k+ accounts.
Since then the number of accounts has dropped to almost half that.
And yes , 100K accounts were online a few days ago after a patch, 
and yes the total number of accounts that are usually on has dropped
in the past week. 

So how am I full of shit.

Oh and by the way get ready to update your guide in a month or so.
