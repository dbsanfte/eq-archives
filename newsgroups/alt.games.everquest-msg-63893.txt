Yeah, better replace the crafted than the Indi boots (5ac difference, not
really a priority atm)
Ooh tough one, an FBSS/Haste on those items would make for some nice damage
<short pause as I run the options thru copelands>
OK the Pair you have atm + an FBSS gives a score of 1017!!! (52nd level
180str)
Whereas the Jade Mace and Jagged Long Sword only 894
Of course this is in theory and the next question would be how well you
could hold aggro with the slow Wurmy even with the FBSS's ambigous haste
adjustment it's delay is in the low thirties. Still not convinced by the
FBSS but by the figures copelands gives you'd be hard pushed to match that
damage.

I think the arguement has got to be swing rate over damage there. My
questioning of copelands is how accurate it can predict the swings of your
off hand weapon to then calculate it's effectiveness.
I think the FBSS would be a good choice, in this instance but don't rush out
and buy one just yet, prices are going to fall in a big way soon.

Crystalline Claw dagger and Spider Fang, yes, both piercers.
(I used to use a FS Rapier off hand till about 16th so my Piercing didn't
have to start from zero when I picked the skill up again in the high 40's)
