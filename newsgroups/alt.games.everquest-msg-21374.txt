For some reason, I always play humans, which does place my druid and
enchanter at a distinct disadvantage. I guess that the reason is that I
love traveling, and I don't want to spoil things for myself by creating
all kinds of newbie characters in different starting towns. I got a much
bigger kick out of visiting Grobb and Oggok under illusion than I would
have if I had started a baby Ogre or Troll there.
