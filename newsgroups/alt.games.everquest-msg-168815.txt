It's about as relevent as any other frame of reference.  I've noticed that
people tend to polarize around either the "big governement is our savior"
campfire, or the "government is a neccessary evil, but evil none the less"
campfire.  From there, any one policial mixture in any nation can be similar
to another nation, as long as you accept that the terms may not be the same.

True, but I'm only talking about the statistically insignificant groups that
differ _in the areas of concern_.  If 98% of democrats believe that Pepsi is
better than Coke, then we can assume that Democrats are Pepsi-drinkers
without having to dredge up the 2% that have the good sense to drink Coke.
All that does is distract attention from the point at hand.

Then would the really be considered liberals in America?  Or would they find
themselves siding with the conservatives over here?

No, but that doesn't really make a difference if the viewpoint is labeled
"moderate."

That's all fine and good, as long as you acknowledge what your doing, and
suffer no delusions that you're actually cleaning it up.
