'Tisn't a "notion".  It's my opinion.  YMMV obviously applies.

I can think of only 3 reasons for inspecting someone:

1)	To see what they're wearing.  I believe they should ask before
	doing so.
2)	To see what is on the comment / background block.  If I could
	show that without showing my gear, I'd do it in an instant.
3)	To annoy people.

The only other "reason" would be an accidental inspect, and I realize
that they happen and take no offence.  Before the ability to turn
inspect off was added, I inspected several people while trying to
target the banker.

Accidents happen.  As for curiosity, ask.  I've often shown someone a
piece of equipment that they asked about, *when they didn't inspect me
first*.

You keep on missing the point; there's nothing rude TO YOU about
inspecting.  If done unasked, it *is* TO ME.  Different people find
different things to be rude; there is no logical criteria for what one
person will find rude that another won't.

Small children find farting at the dinner table hilarious; I find it
rude.  That is OPINION, which is what all definitions of rudeness fall
under.  Yes, your societal upbringing affects what you find rude, but
it is still an opinion.

All worlds are virtual for an appropriate value of "real".  Ask an old
Australian Aborigine.

If you inspect me without asking, then yes, you have done me wrong;
you've crossed *my* boundaries of politeness.

Not usually; I simply refuse to buff them.  Of course the fact that
most of them also don't bother asking politely, or use PLZ, makes it
easy to ignore them.

Then be prepared to accept the results.  With me, the results will be
that I find you rude and refuse to aid you.
