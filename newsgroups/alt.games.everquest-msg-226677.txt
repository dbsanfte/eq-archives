Hi ..

I'm hoping that I might find the answer to my problem here. I've just bought
myself a new PC and sadly I'm not able to get the 3D targeting ring to work
now. The option is checked under the options screen, I have added
UseTnL=TRUE (as suggested in an earlier thread on this topic) to my
EQClient.ini file all to no avail. I even tried UseTnL=1, no luck though.

My PC has an ATI Radeon 9200 graphics card, the latest drivers have been
applied via Windows update as has DirectX version 9.0b

Any ideas anyone?

Many thanks in advance,

Stevie.
