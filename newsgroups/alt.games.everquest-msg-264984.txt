I thought you had a volunteer on the hook there for a bit, too, someone 
who found it odd that you are maintaining it when you don't play, and 
thought he could do a better job, something like that?  Maybe you could 
look a bit more incompetant, you know, like a husband claiming to be 
unable to seperate clothes for the dishwasher?   Works for us!  Don't 
tell Lenny I told you, though.

Lance's Top Ten Winebago Down Sides list

10) they cost more than my house.

9) ever drive one in the wind?  The sense of horror would be my own.

8) Gas milage about 3mpg, gas prices > $2 a gallon

7) Have to also have a vehicle to drive around when "home" is parked... 
but I need hauling capacity of F150 or better.  Hard to tow one of those 
behind the motor home

6) If I can have satelite internet in an RV I can have one in the 
various booths I live in now.  Thus far it doesn't seem viable though, I 
keep talking to friends who are trying it, eventually I think it may 
start to make sense.  Don't need an RV for that, though.

5) Two adults, two pre teens, two cats... -you- stuff them all in an RV 
and see how happy they are.  Its one thing when its just a few months in 
cramped quarters and there's a house out there waiting.  Sell the house 
and its -forever- in that little space.

4) Both adults and both kids are very kibble oriented, packrat types 
all.  We'd need a second RV just for the books, and then there's toys to 
consider.

3) I need a workshop to make swords in; my detached two car garage 
(which will never again see a car inside) works fine since we're zoned 
industrial.  Give up owning property and I'd have to lease work space 
somewhere... probably cost me more than the mortgage payments

2) while I'd be able to park on festival grounds during the season when 
fairs are open, that would still leave roughly 4 months a year when I'd 
have to pay to park somewhere with hookups

1) I'd no longer be able to mock my friends who tried it (you knew I'd 
get to the real reason eventually)
