As far as I can tell my soul is on the borderline between heaven and hell.

The main thing I have learned is that sloth is my deadly sin. I also have
learned that I need to get away from my mother who is now openly worshipping
Satan, and actually could be Satan. I think if I did that then my life might
actually start albeit at a late age, it is never too late to change, I can
tell that the time for change is short, but still quite long, certainly long
enough for anyone to change, actually you may just need to realize that you
are living your life in an unrighteous manner and seek out God and pray for
forgiveness and resolve to change your life and that may be all you need to
do but I doubt it somehow.

Yeah, I need to move out as soon as possible and work on not being slothful
and that would push me into the going to Heaven zone.

My life is really wierd, maybe I do have schizophrenia, I can't help but
feeling that occured due to a moral defect in my character and that I am
being judged for something my parents did and that for a while even if I do
end up in hell someone may come to see if I have changed yet.
