I'm beinging to see more of a patteren here.  I've been doing some testing
with other sound cards. I tested a SB 512PCI, an SB Live, Turtle Beach
Aureal vortex1(8020), vortex value(8010), and a yamaha DS-XG under
Windows2000.  What I have noticed that they all skip or other problems.
What I've noticed is that the PCI cards in my system share IRQ 11.  This
is due to ACPI, which untill 2000 and supossedly ME wasn't fully supported.

I've dissabled ACPI in the past and it helps, but you loss some power
management fetures.  What will happen is that the PCI cards will spread out
among IRQs.  SBs get IRQ 5 most of the time.  Some power saving modes
and the ablitly of the PC to turn itself off will dissapear.  I'm currently
testing
this on my machine with EQ.

Machine is a Pentium III 550
440BX chipset
