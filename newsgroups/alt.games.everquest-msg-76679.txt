Oh man there are a lot of drinks in the game. A LOT.
Almost every city has their own named drinks. Like Vasty Deep Ale
and Felwith's Finest and Lendel's Lager, Underfoot Triple Bock, etc.
Plus, I have seen almost all the cities on the moon carry out the same
tradition.

I'm thinking its a girl, she's probably got expensive tastes, gotta be champagne.
There is a vendor in Freeport that sells Champagne.

Faction may also be a factor, don't forget, do a few quests in Shadow haven.
Also what race is she? Maybe if she is for instance an elf she might miss some drink
from her old hometown maybe.
