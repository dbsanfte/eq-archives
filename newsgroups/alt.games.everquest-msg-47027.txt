Yeah, whatever, you warrior :P

...because DS damage counts as coming from the DSed character, thus 
increasing the odds in a small group that the pet is going to be munching 
experience. Lets add to the fact that keepin an eye on someone else's pets 
health in the thick of battle is damn near impossible. I have to change my 
/assist key every time the pet dies. A taunting pet will keep attacking the 
add that your enchanter is desperately trying to mez. Pets are only 
expendable if you have an unlimited amount of bone chips or malachite. The 
list goes on.

You're right, it does keep the tank alive... until the mob eats the pet and 
runs in to munch the cleric.

Duh.

Try again.

At level 25 mine costs 20 mana (IE 75%) what the mages does. Both do 9 
damage. The mages is fire-based, the Thorns line is not (IE no high mob 
resists). Admittedly, the mages fire shield comes with a +15 save vs fire, 
but in most instances you are paying 20 mana for an effect you aren't using 
at all. Now, at 29 this situation will change, but not knowing my level you 
made a silly blanket statement.

My mana is best spent buffing snaring doting etc, unless I am head healer. 
The mages is better spent petbuffing pethealing and burning.

Have I gained your acceptance now, Oh Great One? May I pass beneath the 
glorious arches of your grace?
