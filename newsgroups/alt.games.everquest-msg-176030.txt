The difficulty of (1) becoming a Jedi, and (2) playing a Jedi is intended to
discourage power-gamers.  A powergamer who constantly finds himself dead
every time he steps away from his keyboard for two minutes is going to find
that very annoying.  Whereas someone who really wants to RP a Jedi and
understands and accepts the difficulties inherent in the class will be able
to live with that (I think).
