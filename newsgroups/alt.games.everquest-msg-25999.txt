For those not familiar, this is the "Ghost of Unrest" who lives in the
very bottom of the basement.  He drops the ever popular Jagged Bands and
Dwarven Work Boots.
  (And before you ask what a 43 warrior was doing down there and start
in with the comments about "farmer" and "bottom feeder", etc. a sister
guild of ours was having a raid there this weekend, and a few of us were
asked along as train derailers. We got there early to check things out,
got bored, and this was about the only mob in the zone that would give
me xp, plus my rings sucked.)
  So my question is, can this guy be rooted?  He's supposedly level 35,
and we had a 39 shammy and 39 cleric hitting him with root *repeatedly*
every time he spawned for a couple hours, and he never once rooted. Or
are all ghosts or all undead immune to root and I just never noticed?
  Oh, by the way, we got several JB's but never saw the boots once. ;-p
