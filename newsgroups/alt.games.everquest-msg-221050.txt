My original character back in 1999 had been a paladin that I took to the mid
30's.   I didn't really enjoy it, so I didn't want to start him up again.
And the rogue that I wanted to play wouldn't have made as good a partner
with the druid I was playing with.    Warrior was the least objectionable
alternative.

If you're running out of mana with KEI on, then you're doing something
wrong.  Since I've been playing my rogue, I've had knight tanks extremely
often, and not a single one has had this problem.   Even the clueless twits
seem to manage.   As another poster said, try casting your lower level
spells, since they still build a large amount of hate.

So add a rogue to the group and stop wasting a third of your mana bar on
pulling.

To the game for your specific class, maybe.  Maybe.

Aggro control, which was the only real skill to combat for most people.
