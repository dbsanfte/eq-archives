Problem with him is spawn time.  Something like 8 hrs.  And, as soon as he
pops, he dies.  There are 3 other mobs there that will aggro you at levels
up to about 19 (iirc).

Go invis and camp at his spawn point just before a patch.  Log in as soon as
the patch is completed and he will be there.  He drops quick and the others
don't hit too hard.  You should be able to take him and get to the guards at
level 16, below that, bring friends.
