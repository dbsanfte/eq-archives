Do a search for Linksys on this newsgroup.  You have to update
your router's bios and then make a few settings changes and
enable some specific ports.  It's simple to do.  If you get
confused then just call Linksys support -- they know about the
problem and have the fix in their script system.  They helped me
just fine.
