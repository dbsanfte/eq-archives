Actually its this "gotta have the "Uba ClAsSes" which is sadly too
popular. I 've been a better mezzer with my necro then several
chanters I have grouped with, better healer with my druid then several
clerics I have grouped with. My Shaman has had much better experiences
with Shadowknights as MAs then I have warriors.

Frankly groups that can't get past the vanilla Warrior, cleric,
chanter, shaman paradigm isn't worth being in half the time. The
beauty of a successful hybrid players are that they are very
resourceful and careful players.

Sloppy play with a hybrid is hazardous.
