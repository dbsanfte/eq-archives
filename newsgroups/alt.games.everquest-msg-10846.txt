    If they're on Bertox faction, then any dwarf that hasn't messed that
faction up (like by killing those NPCs or doing the cleric greaves quest a
few dozen times) should be able to walk up to them and pull the corpse out
without any problems. The more places I visit in the old world, the more I'm
amazed at what great starting faction dwarves have.
