I see that some of the more upscale places to live in Qeynos are in
zones like Qeynos Harbor and South Qeynos. I'm not so sure about
North Qeynos. My question is, why would anyone want to live in these
zones? Only Qeynos Harbor has a mariner's bell and the zones are so
detailed that they take significantly longer to zone into or out of.

It seems to me that I'm in the perfect situation living in Willow
Wood where the bank, the Inn, the Tradeskill instance, and the
mariner's bell are all in close proximity. Why would I want to pay a
platinum piece to buy a house in a zone that would be more
inconvenient?
