Tax laws in the USA and corporate taxes. Indirect expenses like building
mantainance, health insurance, vacation pay, and property taxes are added to
overhead on every employee. What looks like and may in fact be a job being
done by a $20/hour employee is actually represented on the books at
$120-$140/hour. Not unreasonable to assume the logging of the purchase
order, billing, and transfer takes 10-20 minutes and is done at near cost.
