Dear Sirs,

            As I am sure you have been informed I will be off work, as
holiday, for 3 days from Thursday 12th June. I would like to make it clear
to you that, as it is currently the summer, I intend on playing NO Everquest
during this period until, maybe, the evening and will be spending the time
far away from my PC as possible. Please do not feel the need to emergency
patch on these days, in light of my oppotunity to get some play time in off
peak.

Regards

Fully aware that as this is a UK summer I will likely be indoors listening
to the monsoon like rain outside....cursing the EQ servers being down :ï¿½)
