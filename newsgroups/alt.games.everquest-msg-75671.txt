I have always heard people refer to everquest as a "chat room with a twist."
D2 on the other hand is very quiet and secluded unless you have a local
group of friends who play with you.
My buddy at work and a friend of his and me all started out playing EQ
together at the same time but they both are loners and hate having to group
to get ahead so they both went to D2. I am still playing because of all the
friends I have made on Bertox.
I too have D2 and the expansion and it is a very different style of play
nothing to be compared to everquest. If I want to go hack at something and
just get in for a quickie then D2 is the program I start. As for the jerks
in game well several times I have considered leaving everquest because of
the actions of a jerk and Verant's shrugging of responsibility of enforcing
the fair gaming rules and that comes from the fact that there is only a gm
on our server less than 8 hours a week.

I am not bashing VI but I think at $10 bucks a month and over 3000 accounts
on my server, means that for the $30,000 a month they are raking in, they
should have a full time staff of GMs for the game not just poor souls who
use there precious play time to do VI's work.

oops sorry to get off track Everquest is still much better than D2 for
friends.
