well yes, that is the other issue, the main one (i feel)

i'm claiming that because i paid for a copy of the game, i'm allowed
to play the game in a different way

kind of like if you buy monopoly and decide to put $ from community
chest and chance under free parking ... did you violate parker
brothers' copyright by playing the game differently? what if it was
written on the box that you weren't allowed to change the rules?

or yeah, what if you photoshopped the rules to monopoly to allow free
parking (point of fact: it isn't in the rules, and if you play with
anyone younger than 10, they'll want free parking in the game) ...
would your edited version of the rules be a violation of copyright?

i mean, you copied the rules and the rules were copyrighted (assuming
they were, anyway), but then you changed it, so surely you've broken
the law! especially since sony says you did, and they're such a
company of integrity

i prefer the example of fan fiction ... ever stumble upon the millions
of web pages filled with alternate endings and different scenarios
from copyrighted books? are those uses of copyrighted characters a
violation of copyright?

my answer is absolutely not BECAUSE you haven't violated the actual
law that grants rights under copyright ... the blurb i posted 90
million years ago (ie, yesterday), saying that only the copyright
holder can distribute, make copies, etc

making "derivative works" is on that list, and i don't that's what
this is, but if i'm wrong then that's probably why


(i don't know the difference between a "derivative work" and "the
thing i paid to own [the game and the right to use the copyrighted
stuff within] being used differently" ... again, ask a lawyer, i only
wanted to know if anyone thought the idea was cool)
