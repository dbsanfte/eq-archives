I base this on the fact that when hunting Spirocs a while back, i would
routinely (deliberately) pull at least 7 instead of the usual 4.  The reason
was i had enough mana to take down the 4 and then continue to take down the
remaining 3....after they were all rounded up i never once snared more than
4, this was with a tight bunch of 7 mobs.  Also the spell description states
it snares upto 4 targets.  Im not sure how you have managed to make it snare
more.  But i have never met another wizard who has been able to....if u have
to great i would like to hear more about it.  from the spell description BoF
is like a pillar spell hits maximum of 4 targets within range.
