Sorry Ben, but you're wrong.  His very first statement is, not to put
too fine a point on it, a lie:
/quote Furor
The warrior community, up until a month ago, was getting ZERO support
from the Hybrid Knight community in what is obviously a growing problem
in class balance.
/quote
Paladins have been talking about this issue and expressing support for
Warriors in the very Forum he posted this troll for at least six months.

> You got his back up early by misunderstanding his first post.

I misunderstood nothing.  He was all bluster and arrogance.  The opening
lie set the tone and the following insults continued it.  And the BS 
about "knights overstepping their bounds", what a total crock of shit.
Here's a clue:  Knights CAN'T overstep their bounds, SOE sets the rules
for everybody, I can't do a damned thing with my Paladin unless SOE
permits it.  Is that clear enough?

Now, let me make a suggestion.  Go and read the Paladin and Warrior
class descriptions at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp
Note how Paladins are intended to "go head to head with their enemies"
which is a pretty direct description of tanking, SOE intends Paladins
to tank most of the time (unless "occasionally falling back to heal"
means "haha! just kiding, we actually meant staying away from the fierce
claws and jaws of the evil monsters".  Then check out the last sentence
of the middle paragraph of the Warrior class description. After you're
done laughing give them some (hopefully coherent and non-inflammatory)
feedback.  In fact, everybody here ought to go and do that, especially
the non-Warriors.  What's needed is for SOE to give Warriors the ability
to fulfill their class description.  Calling for a knight nerf is a
pathetic act of frustration, not an intelligent response to the fact
that Warriors have been left behind by every class with a manabar.
