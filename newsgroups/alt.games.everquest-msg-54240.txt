I found some interesting quest take place in Stoneburt Mountain, however, I
cannot get enough information about this zone, can anyone give me some idea
how I can go that zone? I try EQAtlas but still confused, it seem it is a
new zone added and cannot find those detail in most site. Also I wonder
should a level 17 ranger live long in this zone. Many thanks.
