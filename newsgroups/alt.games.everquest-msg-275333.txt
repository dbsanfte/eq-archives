Yes it is. But it makes no frigging sense.

Cinderella did not grow up in an Ivory Tower. She grew up in squalor, 
neglected and used by her step-family.

Why would you accuse someone of growing up in an ivory tower and then 
compare them to Cinderella? Hello! Now if you'd gone with Snow White... 
maybe it would work... but Cinderella??
