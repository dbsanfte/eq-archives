 Vox raids are notorious for ending badly. If you really only have a
limited amount of time and the raid is about to start, I'd probably
leave. Nothing like having to log out and having a 2 hour corpse
recovery effort beginning. If you want to see Vox just take a look at
Gorenaire in Dreadlands.  


>Are Vox and Nagafen the easiest of all the dragons?

 I'd say probably not. A few in WW are probably easier. The gimpiest
probably being Yeldema who has been soloed by a Shaman before. And an
Enchanter as well I think. Hechaeva is fairly easy I think I've seen a
warrior/shaman combo kill her.
