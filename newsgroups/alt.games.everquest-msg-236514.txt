I think you can turn it on right at the beginning. 

My sk alt was 17, and is getting leadership xp. 

To contribute progress reports he has done 90% of his leveling as the
leader in 3 person groups... now at 19th he's got almost 3 leadership
yellows.

Thats about 10 yellows of progress, with another 3 yellows of 'deaths'
not represented (Died maybe 8 or 9 times in that period -- engaging
the king in the warrens in a 3 person group at 17th is ...
challenging. :)

That works out to about 20% of my exp in leadership.

I wonder if leadership xp is literally 20% of your 'pixel' progress
through your xp bar and is not looking at the raw amount of xp at all.

So that would make it beneficial to get your leadership on early on.
Not *that* big a deal though... 60 levels is only 300 yellows (no
deaths)... which is a whopping 60 leadership yellows... or 12
leadership points. Enought to buy a couple abilities. And that would
require you to lead every group all the way to 60... 

Note that you only get xp in groups 3 or larger, and I haven't been in
larger groups (4,5,6) and there is supposedly a modifier for more
people... that could change the situation dramatically.

Thoughts?
