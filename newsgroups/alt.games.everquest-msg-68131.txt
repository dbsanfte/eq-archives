You're incorrect. The vast majority, including myself, is playing SoL
just fine.  If it is so important to you that you would start a
petition, I would think  you would be willing to spring a few bucks to
get your system up to date.

Do you think that no other software is released with bugs?  Can you
say Microsoft? Some 50000+ known bugs in Win2k at the time of it's
release last I heard.
