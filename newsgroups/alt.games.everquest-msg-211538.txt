Everything you say is true -- Very low gear dependence also means
very low ability to improve through gear.  Yet, I typically manage
150-175 DPS on mob after mob.(*)

The biggest problem I have is getting anywhere near my potential
burst DPS: With no way to shed aggro I have to be VERY careful lest
I pull aggro and die nearly instantly.  The named giants in PoS
were a prime example of this - got just a tad to itchy on the nukes,
the "tumultous storms" came and knocked me down, then I was summoned
and annihilated.

2 groups, mostly NToV gear, except the tank who had worse, unslowable
mobs, one wizard - but we took them  :)

Ask high level mages what they most want and you'll see either (a) a
means to keep a pet alive against PoP mobs or (b) a means of shedding
aggro.

* Positioning is everything though.  40-45 of my DPS comes from
the proper positioning of my water pet and the ability to use my
BWS (same restrictions as a bow).
