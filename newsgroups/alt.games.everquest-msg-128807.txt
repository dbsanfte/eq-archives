This is interesting. I thought this number either told the server or 
client how frequently to send updates during the game.

Is there any way to tell the server to send updates less frequently, or 
something else to the effect of setting the amount of data sent to/from 
the client, in order to reduce lag while in the middle of a large battle 
scene?
