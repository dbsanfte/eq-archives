I would assume that every item has a unique identifier code even if
identical to other itmes of the same kind (its how it was done in the
exploration code for a multiplayer game I know of). Also it assumes that
saving of the character is the only tim any information is recorded....I
dont think that is the case, as there will be log etc of trades and where
things are kept in 'soft saves' so the server knows at any given time
whats where.....just the save is going to th e backup and recovery files
and that must be the master...it was Diablos fall down that so much info
was mastered at client side and that would have been spotted..
