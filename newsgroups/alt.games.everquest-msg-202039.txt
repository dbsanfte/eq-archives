That is a major problem, that guilds do not keep their guild pages up to
date. The problem with "talking" to people is that it is slow,
inefficent, patchy and not very reliable. You might score the guild
clown/fruit cake or the guild pedantic. Also takes up a lot of game
time. 

In my opinion, if a guild recruits just by talking to people, then it is
always going to be a small guild and unable to be active enough for my
interests (just being able to do stuff).

I take the view that if a guild is active and open, then it will be
reflected in it's web pages. Things like maintaining a full and up
todate calendar of events, plus a clear statement of what the guild is
about and how to apply for membership make a difference.
