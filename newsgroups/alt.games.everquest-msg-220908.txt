Actually Lance, I was talking about the other direction.  Mob riposte
of player attacks.  Tell me Lance, does it make sense to you that it
should decrease a players defense (in effect) to have his attacks
hasted?  (Haste me and the mob does more damage.)  Independently of
that question, does it make sense for my effective defense to get
noticeably worse (i.e. I take more damage) if I switch from using a
rusty Halberd to a sword and _shield_!  Yes, a melee takes more
damage as a reward for equipping a shield (due to the increase in
riposte damage from using a faster 1h weapon).

Why not?  I'm serious.  EQ is not a combat simulator, it's not even
close.  If you feel the need for a rationale, it's not hard to invent
one (the riposter takes some time to "get the feel" of the rispotee's
attack pattern, the ripostee adjusts when the riposter gets an extra
attack in, rinse-repeat).  For that matter, in real melee does Joe
Twohander get more attacks when his opponent switches to a lighter
(faster) weapon?  Or does he get fewer because he's more frequently
dodging/parrying his opponent's attacks?  Or does it all wash out, he
loses some attacks to defending himself and gains others because his
opponent is making himself vulnerable more often?  The current system
doesn't make any sense, and on top of that it breaks weapon + shield
and weapon + weapon as viable choices.

I am not arguing whether it is "right".  What I'm saying is that as
far as I can tell it does not reflect the player population.  It
looks to me as if more than one-sixth of the player population is
primarily a Warrior or Knight (I could be wrong, I don't have any
way to conduct a valid survey).  Certainly from the flawed viewpoint
of (just to pick an example) Ornate armor molds/patterns the fact
that plate molds cost more than 5x as much as silk patterns and
3x chain and leather suggests an imbalance (yes, I know there are
two non-tank classes that wear plate, even so...).  And I do see a
disproportionate number of tanks when I use the LFG tool.

I'm not experienced in the raid game, and not interested in commenting
on it except for this:  There are two principles that guide me in-game,
each as important as the other, (1) have fun, and (2) don't wreck the
fun of others.  Furor has made it quite clear that (2) is of no concern
to him, and many of his followers are apparently unaware that it could
even be a consideration (in game or IRL AFAICT).  It would be total 
bullshit to wreck the casual knight's game because of issues with the
raid game (the reverse is also true).
