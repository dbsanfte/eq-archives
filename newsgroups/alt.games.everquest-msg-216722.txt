These aren't ordinary LD's, they are LD while zoning.. so I can't
see how I could possibly have an "active character" which is
normally, as you suggest here, a PC standing there doing nothing,
possibly because they have aggro of some kind.

Am I not actually zoning?  Or finishing zoning and then just
standing there on the far side?  Maybe I need a witness.

I'm running a 1.8gig Pentium 4 with 768m memory, using a 56k
modem dial up.  Nothing at all changed about the system, which
worked fine right up to the patch where LDoN went live.  Its
funny that the problem it caused is a minor annoyance as long as
I'm not trying to do an LDoN mission, though.
