I started as a newbie just recently on a blue server (Cazic-Thule)
but quickly moved to Tallon Zek when friends of mine said they'd like me
to join with their group at some point when my character's up to snuff.

My experience so far is that most people there are not there to kill for
no reason.  There are a few that just seem to enjoy playing a very thin
character, e.g. "I'm a gnome, and gnomes hate elves, so I will kill every
elf I can on sight".  I suppose that's ok (and have been PK'd that way
about 5 times so far), but it doesn't interest me.  I'd rather
play a character that seems to have some moral code... like you said... you
don't kill till someone pisses you off.  Or perhaps, you hate elves, but you
arrange to kill them in more subtle ways... trickery, cons, deception,
etc.  Otherwise, it just turns into a video game.

And yes, it's much harder to level when you have to worry about people
attacking you while you are fighting off a mob (or are recovering from
having just fought one off).  So what that tends to make me do is avoid
the areas where the PKers are and seek out other hunting grounds.  So
in some ways it forces me to be a bit more adventurous.

Another side effect is that you don't ever want to carry any kind of money
around because of the looting after you are PK'd.  This makes for frequent
trips to the bank.  When I have to travel through a hostile area, I empty
my pockets at the bank first.  For fun, sometimes I'll leave like 2 copper
in my pocket so that I can get the "oh gee, I got two cents off this stupid
druid" reaction :-)

One final thing is that the PKers I've run into so far have been very
generous about letting me get my corpse back.  So far, I haven't experienced
any corpse camping.  Indeed, on one corpse run, the guy that PK'd me gave
me several buffs when I saw him again!  So there is hope for mankind.
