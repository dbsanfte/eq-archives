I've seen some pretty impressive performance out of machines with dated 
CPU's but plenty of RAM and a great video card. The differences in hard 
drive performance are rarely that noticable. RAID is good if you 
configure for performance rather than fault tolerance and go with a SCSI 
controller. Say what you want about the lower cost of IDE RAID solutions, 
but the fact is they don't offer much in the way of performance boost. 
SCSI is not much better, but it is better. 

For my money, I'd probably just stick with a single 10k RPM IDE drive, 
though a 7200 RPM would likely more than suffice.

Since you already increased your RAM to 1GB - a very good decision, btw - 
I would next concern myself with making sure I've got a great video card. 
The new line of Radeons from ATI look very good for the money.
