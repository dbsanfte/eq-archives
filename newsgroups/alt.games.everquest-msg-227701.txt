That review didn't particularly strike me as SoE fanboy fluff like you're 
insinuating. If you've played the demo, you'd recognize it as a decent

Let's all hop off the anti-SoE bandwagon and try to keep it objective here. 
I do still boggle at the number of people so against SoE yet continue to 
pay them regularly for their product. ;)
