For example, Increase Strength, a low level necro spell: I lose 10 str and
my target gains 10 str.  Why is this good?  Well, I don't really need
str much as a necro, while you presumably could use some more.  Not
that 10 points is a big deal, but maybe we get higher level ones later.

As a side note, the debuff I recieved when casting this, the one that
took 10 str from me, used to be removeable without taking down
the 10 point buff you got, now it is not.  Not that it ever should have
been removable, but there you have it.

Another example is the cleric str buff line, reckless strength et al.  This
buffs your str way up (say 30 points) but then gradually declines until
it becomes a debuff, lowering your str and falling still further until it
runs out (in this case reaching neg 30.)  Not removable when cast
on others, not even while it is still positive.  Used to be removable when
cast on yourself, haven't checked since the patch.  Why would this
be good though?  Well, if you are doing pull, med, pull, work, then
you have the massive str buff to kill with and med up while you are
under the penalty... ok, so it isn't used much.
