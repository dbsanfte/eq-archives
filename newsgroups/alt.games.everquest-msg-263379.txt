Damn...hope that is just a peculiarity of those cities.  One of the most fun
things for me in EQ1 was trying to figure out ways to kill things that I
could not kill the normal way.  For example, as a Wizard, trying to kite
multiple wyverns in Cobalt Scar, I wanted to do the ones around the thingy
you click to zone to Skyshrine.  That room is pretty small, and it can be
hard to run down the twisty ramp out of that with a wyvern on your ass
without getting killed.  The wyverns are spaced just a little too far for an
AE to hit more than one, so no AE snaring them.  What I finally came up with
that worked well was to go in, stun one, stun another, then step back out
the window while levitating, and quckly zap one or two more with my Staff of
Temperate Flux, then turn and run.  They would follow me out the window,
fall to the water, the stunned ones wake up and follow, and I could then
bring them to shore, run them around to get them close enough for AE, and
use my AE snare.

Similar in DAoC.  Gotta kill some guy for a quest who is about an even con
to my mid 20's Healer.  He is in the middle of a big camp.  I've been trying
to figure out a way to do this solo, basically using mezzes and stuns to
split the camp, at least long enough to get far enough in the fight so that
I'll win to advance the quest, even if I then die to a horde of blues and
greens.  I've come close a few times, but never quite got it.  I think there
is some balance between clearing part of the camp first (those that are far
enough away from their friends that I can get them alone), and then trying
to mez the rest, but I haven't found it yet.  Trying to find it is fun.

Wait a second.  When I died, it gave me a dialog saying the were four
penalties for dying:

    1. Experience debt.

    2. Res illness that reduces stats for a while.

    3. Equipment suffers wear upon death.

    4. Something else I don't remember.

I later wanted to check this out again, and the online help section on death
said there were three penalities.  I forget which of the 4 above was missing
from the help (I reported this inconsistancy as a bug).
