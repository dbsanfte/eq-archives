Its important that your cleric get himself beat on a lot.  I know, a
talented player can avoid it.... but you'll suffer later.

Clerics are a Plate class for a reason.  Sometimes aggro is
unavoidable, or even desirable, as a cleric.  When this
happens, you want AC in order to not take the smackdown
like a wizard.  AC has three components, the AC of your
equipment (you can get pretty good stuff, really) your
agility (which doesn't matter much as long as its over 75)
and (drum roll) defense.

Don't get beat on, and your defense doesn't go up.  Bergh
is not my first cleric, so when I leveled him up I was
quite familiar with the techniques of aggro avoidance... and
I discovered at level 30 that I'd almost completely neglected
defense!  Had my offense and 2hb skills and my various
casting skills maxed out for my level, mind you, but defense
was under 50.  It was a hard 10 levels before I managed
to get my defense up to the level limit, but it increased my
AC by about a third!

Longer root coming up soon, Enstill, by the way.
