my two favorte zones for brewing were west freeport and south qeynos

get yourself a list of recipes, sorted by trivials if possible, printed out
and just start brewing

make friends with a couple of druids/rangers/iksars/anyone else that can
forage, cuz later on almost every single recipe will need foraged items

and i do mean stack upon stack of fruit, berries, amd most of all vegies
