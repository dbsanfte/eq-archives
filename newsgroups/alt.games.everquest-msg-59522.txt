It's relatively easy: If it walks on four legs and its amiable to me (I
mostly play a Druid), I don't kill it. If it walks on two legs and it's
indifferent to me, I don't kill it either... That goes for Dervishes,
Frogs, Aviaks, Centaurs, Tizmaks, Ulthork, Kerrans, and probably a few
others I'm forgetting.

But the golden rule is: If it looks like I'm going to feel guilty for
killing it, I don't.
