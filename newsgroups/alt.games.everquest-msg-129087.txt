It seems to be a level thing. I remember not being able to mezz the giants
in burning wood, but then later at a higher level I had no trouble.
Personally I think hunting at the giant fort sucks big time anyway.... Ive
hunted there a lot so I know. You get overpulls much too frequently, the
giants are faster than normal mobs, they cant mezz, they have a lot of hp.
I went to the OT at level 25 with my enchanter and DL at 35, and skipped FM
completely. Id go to DL... you wont have trouble getting a group even if you
are still too low to mez things, just for the clarity and haste. By 40,
things will mez ok anyway.
