You don't need him.  All he does when you give him the gems is
to tell you the information you need to know to complete the
quest.  But if you've read about the quest on Allakhazam,
you should already know that information.

If you have all four rings, all you need to do is go
down into the Qeynos Catacombs and find Vin Moltor,
then give him 3 bottles of Kalish and a Rat Meat Pie.
(The Rat Meat Pie can be acquired by giving Rat Ears
to the enchanter who hangs out on the lake in the NW
portion of Qeynos Hills, he'll tell you how to make one.)
Vin Moltor will then give you the Paw Container (make sure you 
have an open main inventory slot to receive it in).  Then just 
put the four rings in it and hit "combine", and you're done.

Alternately, you can just kill Vin Moltor and he drops
the Paw Container when he dies.  He gives large, but not
enormous, faction hits when you kill him.

Vin Moltor can be found around the area marked "1"
on this map: http://www.eqatlas.com/qeynoscatacombsmap.html
He's not always up.  If not, just kill stuff in that
whole area, until he spawns.  He looks like a beggar.
