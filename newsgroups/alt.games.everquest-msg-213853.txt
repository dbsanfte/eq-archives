I seem to recall that for LDON purposes, all toons were supposed to be
within 10 levels of each other.  I don't know if that was for beta or if
it's a feature of LDON.  Most folks created the strongest toons possible for
the dungeon levels we were supposed to be testing, so I can't say with any
certainty that it changed the instance to the levels.
