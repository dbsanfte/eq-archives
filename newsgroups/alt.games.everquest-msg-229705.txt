Well, if the slow start was at all related to hard drive contention,
it would help a lot.  But.. it doesn't appear that's the case.

Ah.  Well, I did try running from two directories (and drives) and
noticed no improvement.  I guess one option would be more to put the
second copy on the old models    (/shudder  hehe) Somehow I suspect
that will speed up the startup.

Ah, good tip.

I should do that for the second instance.  Maybe.  Kinda nice to hear
when the cleric gets smacked though  ;-)

Is it the old create a text file named "nosound.txt" or some such
thing?

Yeah.  Figured as much.
Last night, the windowed mode gamma seemed a bit low, so I'd full
screen when I'd go out and pull, then toggle back to windowed when I
was back at the fight spot.  Seemed to work well enough and served my
purposes.
