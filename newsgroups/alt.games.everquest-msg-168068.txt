I agree.  A friend of mine's guild has helped him power level to 48 in an
incredibly short amount of time.  He's a druid.  He's never played in Iceclad. 
Or Eastern Wastes.  Or the Overthere.  He's never seen Stonebrunt for cryin out
loud.  Any time he plays with him we have to give him directions - he has no
idea where anything is!!  So much of the game is lost if you spend FORTY FIVE
LEVELS on an experience grind.  
But he seems really happy with his lot in life and he says it's important to
his guild so I always just congratulate him on his newest level....
Me on the other hand?  I want to see the world!  My wizard friend and my ranger
have explored almost every zone within our levels.  It's our "Saturday thing to
do".  Pick a place, print the map, and go check it out.  We don't always get
alot of experience but we always have fun.
