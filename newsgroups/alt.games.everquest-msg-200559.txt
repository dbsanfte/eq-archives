My primary point was that he is above the softcap for non-pop
xp mobs.  He's more than capable of tanking them unslowed without
the cleric having KEI and still maintaining a very fast pull
rate.  If the PoP zones ZEM were reduced to that of pre-PoP zones,
why would we fight to find a slower to kill there, when we 
can just run off to an old world zone without one and bring 
anyone one we darn well want in the last 2 slots? (usually 4
of us that form the core of a group - 65 ranger, 65 druid,
me (63 mage) and a 65 cleric 'bot)  Yeah, we lose a chunk of
xp per kill because we'd be pulling streams of 55+ mobs instead
of 61/62 mobs - but our increased kill rate on lower hp mobs
would balance that pretty well, and not having to deal with
finding a slower/true tank to handle those 500 hitter level
62 mobs would balance the rest out.  Had a couple of groups
today that were flat flying through the xp (3 blue an hour in
62) for an hour at a time - then pulls came to a sudden STOP
because we lost our slower and had trouble finding one flagged
for PoV.  Losing 30minutes to 45minutes at a time because of
losing *1* person was just frustrating as hell, and brought
my true xp gain down to 1.5 blue and hour for the day.
