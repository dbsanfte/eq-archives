I count that as the best thing they could do to the druid epic. 
Following reasons:

Now work on unsnareable mobs.
If resisted, all was resisted, so a LOT better chance of landing it now.
Can now use a normal snare instead, so you can have a snared mob for 
OVER 3 min without having to land the dot again.
Causes less aggro due to no snare, and can now actually be used on ToV 
raids at the start of a fight without automatically becoming a death 
sentence.
Can now be used as extra dmg while quadding. Impossible before, since 
epic snare had different slow than normal snares.
Can be used while kiting mobs around (IE, Ice Burrowers, Renux for rogue 
epic), because it make less aggro, and dont screw up snare (try an 
unsnared ice burrower and having to land a 9 sec cast time dot on it).

A few druids from guild complained too, and after talking to them and

pointing out the advantages, the ONLY complaint were that one of the

druids liked to start his kiting in Grey with epic, have to use a normal 
snare first now.

Read these good points, and rejoice over a much better epic that it was 
before.
