}Pronouncability is a KEY feature of a "unit of language". An
}abbreviation isn't a "unit of language", it is a shortening of a "unit
}of language" and isn't actually proper grammar...

Respectfully, /disagree.  Pronouncability is a key feature of a unit of 
_spoken_ language, but language may also be written.  If you are 
discussing written language, pronouncability is no longer a key feature.  
A shortening of a unit of language generates a shorter unit of language.  
Proper grammar is a function of usage.  That's why it changes as usage 
changes.  Sometimes, it lags a few decades behind, but that's just the 
way it is.

JMHO.
