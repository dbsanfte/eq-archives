Yea, my monk Dominic recently got the gi, pants and wristbands in cured silk
and now he looks like Phin the trainer in Qeynos. I love the look. I bought
a raw silk robe but didn't wear, kept using the netted shirt cause I thought
the orange robes look weird. Now I only need three more pieces to have cured
silk everywhere and as soon I can catch the person who tailored for me, I'm
getting the rest.
