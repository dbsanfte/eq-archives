Ones that save me a lot of time and page flipping is
to organize my spell book into categories and then use the /book command
to get to those areas in my spell book fast.

Main - main buffs and most used spells, Sow, snare, root, healing, regen, dots, skin, DS

Utility - spells used on a situational basis: camo, Enduring Breath, Levitate, Invigor,
Cancel magic

Resist - Resists and cures , more spells used on a situational basis.

Rings - Self ports

Circles - group ports

Animal - charms, fear, pet buffs, sense animal


I also have 2 buttons to turn on and off tracking players ( wish this was a toggle)

My forage button is ties to my left turn key so that everytime I turn
left I forage. Note: keep this button blank or forage or sense heading on
all the hotkey bank pages, so you don't accidentally hit something bad with
an npc guard/merchant targeted.

One tip I teach every new druid I tutor is to ALWAYS have snare/ensnare
memorized this is one of the most useful spells in the game and can save
your ass like no other one. Being able to out run monsters is a good thing.
Most other spells you can switch out as needed, have a gem reserved for
snare and keep it the same.
