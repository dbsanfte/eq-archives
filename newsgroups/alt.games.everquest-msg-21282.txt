Master smith, master baker, master fletcher, tailor pretty well too. Been
playing off and on since May '99. "plenty", "Plenty?", "PLENTY!!!???".
Selling to other players?

Ha ha ha! That's the best laugh I have had all day. I think I have to go
auction a rat sandwich somewhere.

You know, every rat I have ever killed has two ears on it. Ditto for things
like beetles having at least two eyes.<edible goo if you don't see where I
am going with this>

Bats have two wings, all mamals have meat, skins, etcetera. Reptiles too
when you think about it. Never seen a spider w/o legs.

Only Verant would have the gall to have all these death, blind, and
otherwise handicapped vermin walking around missing various body parts and
then claim to be ~a trade skill friendly environment.

I think this same thing came up about 2 years ago when Brad tried to justify
heal potions that cost 30 pt "because someone bought *one*". Sure, somebody
probably made a profit in trade skills, maybe 5 or 6 people per shard.
