I've had the same thing happen in Unrest when helping out some guildies.
I'd be sitting by the back wall in Greater Wolf Form, with guildie all
buffed up killing tormented dead.  Guildie sitting there at full health,
MoBs just over half, and this finger wiggler comes up and AoEs em all and
kills em.  No XP for Guildie.  About the fourth time that happened (and
guildie getting noticably upset), I sent the guy a polite tell, asking him
to pleas stop KSing my friend.

I got a response back "WTF d00d, I was just helping and keeping him from
getting killed"...hmmm, he and I must have different thoughts on the matter,
so I informed him that I was more than capable of doing that without
stealing XP.

Would have been nice if he would have asked if we needed help, rather than
just assumed and wasted our mana and stolen the XP, but oh well...live and
learn.
