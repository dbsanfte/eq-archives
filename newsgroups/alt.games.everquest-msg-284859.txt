The order in which you get onto the rampage list sets the fixed rampage
list, and changes in the hate list order do not modify that, OTHER than the
person at the top of the hate list is never rampaged.

As the mob notices you (i.e. you get onto the hate list) you are added to
the rampage list.  When the mob rampages it checks the first person on the
rampage list, if they are a) out of range or b) top of the hate list, it
picks the next person and checks again.

Being FD temporarily removes you from the rampage list but not permanently,
once you stand up you regain your position.

So you don't need to 'draw aggro', you can just tag the mob with a single
arrow.  Setting rampage is a key raid tactic, and basically involves the
raid being patient while tanks tag the mob with arrows first, so that
healers are way down the rampage list.

AE Rampage is different, but then it doesn't turn up until PoP so not on
the progression servers yet.

Finally, people report some mobs add you to the hate list by just seeing
you (LoS aggro) which means you must be careful while they're being pulled
to get tanks on the rampage list quickly before the healers / casters are
in sight.  Vindi does this.
