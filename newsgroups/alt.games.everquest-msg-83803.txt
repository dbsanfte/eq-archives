That would probably be a bad hunting area choice for me at level 47, I
haven't actually been there though, so I could be wrong.  The drop rate
claimed at Allakhazam's was around 1 out of 15 mobs.  You need 3 to get the
EB item.  OK, 2 hours is probably not out of line for dropping 45 blue mobs
with a decent group.
