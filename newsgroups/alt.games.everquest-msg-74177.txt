Funniest picking on newbies I ever saw was a guy who tricked the newbie into
hitting slash D.  He didn't immediately smear but hid in the area after
giving him an item justifying the slash D.  The newbie was fighting orcs at
EC and the guy hid out and shot him with arrows during the battle and being
a LVL 50 got quite a few crits and hits with the spectral bow.  It took the
newbie several minutes to figure out what was going on and the guy never
really killed him just made it really interesting.  I watched over the LVL
50 's shoulder and it was a riot.  He 'd shoot and move and the guy was
clueless sending tells for help and the like.  The LVL 50 did later hand
down most his old gear to the guy which put him in twinkdom really quick.  A
LVL 9 with a treeweave go figure so it paid off to amuse the LVL 50!
