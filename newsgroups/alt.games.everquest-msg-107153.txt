I believe many people agree with you. Granted I am not sure but IMO I do think
they agree with you. I think that the existance of the ability to twink
characters is what has granted EverQuest such a long life. May people state that
one of the things that EverQuest has is its "replay-ability". I think the
ability to twink is what helps create this "replay-ability" and allows EverQuest
to have stayed around for 3+ years. There are so many people I knew at the start
of my character that no longer play their starting character by play the 2nd or
3rd alternate character done the road from that first. They chose to do so
initially because of their ability to twink allowed to break some of the
monotous nature of the beginning aspects of the game.
