Doh! Oh yeah, I guess I'd heard of that.  Sure, sounds like a drive thru 
curch to me, albeit a bit special purpose.  And here I thought it was such 
an original concept. :) I guess what really made it seem special to me was 
that it was qute obviously not -really- a drive thru church, but they just 
hadn't taken down the old sign.
