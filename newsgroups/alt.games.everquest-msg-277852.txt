That was the first thing I noticed when I read the release, that Smed
justified the decision by saying that the "vast majority" either
supported it or didn't care. I felt that dishonest by lumping those two
positions together to create the vast majority that Smed claims
justifies this new service.  He never once indicated how many people
actually supported the prospect of such a service and how many checked
that they didn't care.  You know the former itself isn't above fifty
percent, and probably isn't even close, otherwise Smed wouldn't have
had to include the "I don't care"s to create his "vast majority", and
if it was close to half the playerbase, he could have used the point
that more people approved of it than disapproved and threw out the "I
don't care" vote altogether.  I'm thinking they used the "I don't care"
vote to bolster whatever position on this issue they had wanted.  If
they had wanted to quash such a service, SOE could just have easily
said that the "I don't care" votes support maintaining the status quo.
After all, "I don't care" isn't advocating either position.

'Cause you know the "I don't care"s were the actual vast majority in
that poll.  When you've been playing a game for five years and seen
SOE's palpable apathy toward enforcing their EULA, and probably
encountered and become friends with people who have either bought or
sold items or characters, there's not a whole lot of incentive to give
a shit.  If SOE doesn't care, why should you?
