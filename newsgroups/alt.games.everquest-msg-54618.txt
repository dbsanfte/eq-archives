Patch day is when they keep you from playing so they can fix
problems that should have been caught during testing.  I
think they should find a better way to do it.  I mean, come on!
Six to Eight hours to patch. What are they thinking!  I pay my
10 bucks a month and should be able to play whenever I want.
I think I should get a refund for my down time.
