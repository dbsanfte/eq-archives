I'm sure they saw it coming, who didn't - what do you expect them to do?  
Increase their pipe or add additional servers for the patch?  Not gonna 
happen.  They know everyone and their dog are going to be hitting it at the 
same time and complaining about the time, but they don't care because they 
know you will stick it out and get real excited about the new expansion 
when you finally get to play and forget about the horrible download.

I'm sure they are getting a kick out this NG, too, and have been all day.  
I sure would if I worked there.
