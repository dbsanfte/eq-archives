I'm an ex-player and I've continued to come here, read posts and post my own 
messages for a long time after leaving. Mostly because it's a mature, 
intelligent community and I like keeping track of what's happening in the 
game world that was such a huge part of my gaming life for a long time. It's 
mostly a positive thing, I don't see a lot of the whiners who've left stick 
around very long.
