HQ cats you may be lucky..depends on the server, the newer the server
often the higher the price (assuming its not so young as to e highly
restricted for money). Torvonnilous they sell for about 2pp each pelt so a
stack makes 40. On Antonoius its higher (5pp per pelt I have seen making
the 100pp per stack, but usually its less).

if somoene is seriously tailoring then yes. A stack would be useful.

Othe HQ pelts, bears sell at a higher price as they are rarer. Wolf pelts
also sell well in areas away from source. In source areas then they do
worse than cat pelts as there is less demand and the mob is lower so the
low levellers can harvest them and wills ettle for less.

If you aint tailoring stacks of spider silk sell for a bundle, spiderling
silks for less, though its better for you to convert them to stacks of
thread or cord yourself.

Zombie skins sells to poisoners in stacks, and last the traditional stacks
of bone chips sell well.
