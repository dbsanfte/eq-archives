NOT just the MT!!!  I've been in groups where the chanter was AFK *way* too
much - and it only takes once to have a wipe.  Where the beastlord or mage kept
*forgetting* to send his pet in.  Or the slower had to be reminded to slow. 
Etcetera and so on.  
But I notice they are always right there eager to /ran on the loot.  
I am far more offended by support classes doing a crappy job than I am the MT
because no one ever has the nerve to say anything to *them*.
