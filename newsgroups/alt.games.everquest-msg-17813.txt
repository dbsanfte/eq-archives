Post patch we went to Fear. Fright was humping my leg like his life
depended on it and I knew the CH wasn't going to land in time. Fired off
auto-rip and he didn't budge. CH landed, and he was still stuck to me
like glue. Given this evidence, I would say melee disciplines like
autoriposte are uneffected. Haven't had a chance to try fortitude
(warrior DA) yet though

PGT proc is more akin to a rune, which I doubt they'd mess with in this
way. Imagine runing an entire raid....
Sontalak shouts, 'DAMNIT!!! They're all runed, so I won't hit any of
them. I'll just stand here while they kill me I guess...'


What WILL be interesting is seeing whether DA removes you from the hate
list completely, or just shields you for the duration of the spell.
Obviously, the latter is more sensible, but also requires more tricky
programming...
