been away for a year and during a quiet spell decided to load eq again..
mm things look v nice - new downloadable eq interfaces, shared bank slots,
frogs, mp3 player and more.
i still have nice equipment just not sure where to go hunting now. never had
problems finding groups.
i havent got planes or later expansions so any suggestions for zones?
