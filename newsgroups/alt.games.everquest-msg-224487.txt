First time someone comes to me for help (newbie or otherwise), I help--heal,
root, mez, whatever is needed, but I try not to take the kill.

Second time, unless it's a couple hours later or a genuinely bad pull
something--not them trying to PL off of me--the kill is mine.  I mem blur
and nuke.  (I never keep charm up for some reason.)  Or if I'm on my druid,
I snare it and tell them to run for the zone.  They're on their own after
that. ;P
