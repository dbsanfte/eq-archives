Level 60 or better?
Erm...you can go higher than level 60? At the moment verant won't allow
leveling past 60 because at them moment if you were to get to 61 you
instantly become a Merchant ;�)

Seriously, what level is the AC then? A level 52 warrior can solo Slate who
is 42nd and hits in the 100+ mark constantly.

Unless you were thinking like me about the AC in Sth Ro and warrior could
never solo him because as soon as he spawns, he's nuked :�)
