   Okay, here's my take on this.  Lokari is a farmer, and
raises
several pigs for slaughter, and a few for the country fair
circuit.  If she were to suddenly get a large influx of
shiny 
pennies, she would be able to afford to slaughter fewer
pigs, 
and have more being trundled off to various country fairs
being
fed corn-dogs and cotten-candy by giggling 7 year olds.   
This would drastically improve the moral on her pig ranch,
of
course.  

Annie <--- Has cats, but they're already spoiled silly and
           no amount of pennies is going to change that.
