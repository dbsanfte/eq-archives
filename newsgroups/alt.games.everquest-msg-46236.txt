Eh? It's a known fact, I thought you were an EXPERT. After all you know
everything right? You should know that WNV is active and spreading... If
it's news to you then I certainly can't give credence to anything else you
have said. Resorting to the conspiracy argument is not only weak, it shows
you are no longer debating but simply debunking. Sad sad sad...

You are so right, there have never been any cases of small pox, it's a myth,
it simply has never existed... Do you have any idea how stupid you sound?

SMALL POX, highly contageous, bane of the world for many decades, killer of
many, and ripe for relase in our current society. What do you not
understand?

That's the point, it is known to be not under control but defeated in North
America. I can't comment on your cow related liasons.

Let's just say after reading many of your posts I have understood you to

You are simply repeating a ground ero event over and over without taking

Why should I make your case for you, you have failed to do it for yourself.
unfortunately I do not resort to pretending to know it all, telling people
they have no hope, and continue to preach doom and destruction. I took a
healthy approach to what the average guy could do for his family, and you
have turned it into a no win scenario. Hope you are very proud of yourself.

I go by medical personel who are trained to some extent for this as well as
military people I know. I could pretend I am some lab wiz who plays with
deadly diseases but I prefer to be genuine.

Sorry you have job stress, is that my fault? You seem to make everything my
fault. Have any vacation time?

Wow you posted before how it was a fantasy that vaccines were available. Try
harder to be concise and factual. Hint, less emotion, more facts.

Nuclear events at a power plant can be provoked. What's so silly about that?

True, but your advice is to do nothing. To simply roll over and die if you
are in an area that this occurs.

You are the one telling people, do nothing, don't prepare, ignore Falsa...
DIE DIE DIE is your motto. Just hope it doesn't happen is your only advice.
If that's NOT your advice which you have been spending reems of virtual
paper typing, go ahead Mr. Expert, tell everyone what they CAN do!

There is no such thing as fasle peace of mind. You either have it or your
don't. Your world there seems to be no such thing. The world I know of,
according to my contacts, there is.
