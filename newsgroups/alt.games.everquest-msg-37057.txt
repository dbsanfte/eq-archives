I've made the run many times without SOW. SOW is not "desperately
needed" or even non-desperately "needed". It's a convenience that
makes the run easier, but it certainly can be done without it.

By the way, only some of the DRACHNIDS (There are no "Driders" in EQ,
I don't care how similar Drachnids are) see through invis.
