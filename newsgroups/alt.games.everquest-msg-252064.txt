Nonsense, if That is the definition, then anyone can effectively solo. 
If you can kill two out of three, then you only need a bit more work to 
figure out how to get that last one.

IF you defined it as something on the order of "makes more exp per hour 
soloing than he would in 2/3rds of random pickup groups" you'd have a 
point.  IN the case of the rogue, if you defined it as "gets more exp 
per hour than a druid ten levels lower than him does hunting the same 
mob" you'd have a point.  But your definition isn't class based, its 
merely a question of the players' ability to play consistently.

I can easily find you druids who die one out of every three quads, bards 
who die one out of every three swarms of ten... its not the class that's 
at fault there, nor the gear, its the guy pulling the strings from 
behind the curtain!

Splendid (who has never soloed a rogue and only soloed a warrior to 
level 30, so is clearly talking out of his hat, er, I mean in a 
theoretical philosophical sense)
