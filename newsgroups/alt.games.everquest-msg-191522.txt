In the SE corner of  The Overthere is a 2 spawn of Sarnak in a round tower.
They are good xp and a fairly fast spawn rate.  When you get ready to move
on, there is a ruined structure west of the Iksar vendor at the mudhole with
6 or so spawns.  There is also a PoK book at the outpost that is safe to
port in and out of.  Just went from 42-46 there the last couple of days.
