You mustn't have had good GMs. Good GMs make the adventure follow the
players around. If my players wanted to sit in the tavern all night instead
of exploring the catacombs I spent all last week designing for them, I'd
have to make something else happen. But you can't expect EQ to come up with
that stuff on the fly. If you want to spend all weekend in a tavern, it lets
you, it's your time.
