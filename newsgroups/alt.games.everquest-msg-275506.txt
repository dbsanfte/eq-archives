I have a 36 Dirge that is my main, and so far I haven't had alot of
complaints about the patch,
I haven't really gotten into Crafting that much, so the Crafting patch
didn't affect me as much as others.
I prefer Questing for my gear, so buying it doesn't affect me as much.
I don't really sell alot of stuff in Merchant mode, and when I do, I
find that Harvested stuff seems to sell much quicker than any other
items.
I've tended to sell to Merchants before, mostly because I have no
patience for the Merchant Selling.
Since I'm a Dirge, I run everywhere, (even before the patch I could run
faster than Pally/SK or seemed to) so the Horse thing doesn't bother
me.

And I like the new Con system.. much prettier..

/pizza is an awesome new idea

Overall. I'm not unhappy with the patch, but I see only one problem so
far.
There were people who already had large caches of money, these people
will now be the Nobility , as it were, and Upgrading to new houses,
with their prohibitive costs, will be near impossible.

There has to be some money in the economy, Inflation is a part of life,
What they are trying to implement seems to be closer to a Communist
state, maybe they should hire and economist to explain to them how a
money based system is supposed to work.
