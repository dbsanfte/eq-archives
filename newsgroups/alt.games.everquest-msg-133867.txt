Well, personally, I don't mind if a cleric nukes IF there's backup 
healing and they're okay on mana, and I don't mind if a cleric melees IF 
they're any good at keeping an eye at what's going on.  I've had clerics 
melee and heal just fine, I've had others throw nukes and start meleeing 
*mezzed adds* while group members are screaming at him to leave the 
!@#$ing add alone and heal already *g*  I just hit 30 tonight and right 
now (fighting in HHK) if we have any adds, I prefer the cleric to keep 
on his or her butt and heal as necessary, leaving the damage dealing and 
crowd control to someone else.  But one mob at a time?  No problem.
