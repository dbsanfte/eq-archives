If your having problems that early in VT, your going to have massive
problems deeper in.

What exact problems were you having, that was causing repeated wipes?

Upto DXV (where you were headed) is what I'd call the last of the "trivial"
parts of VT.. and traps become more common.. mobs become tougher.. dps
drops, and mob numbers increases massively.

Theres not much in PoP that beats ssra/VT loot (yet).. so the difference
isnt as huge as you'd imagine.
The only real difference is, as a bigger guild, James has been farming
Emp/VT a lot longer.. so whilst they still have (majority) the same stuff..
they have LOTS more of it.

Furor, the best geared warrior in the game, has something like 9800 HP - my
guild has 2 warriors with about 9200HP, the #1 guild on my server does too.
Im sure yours and James do, CiH.. everybody does.. thats a small difference,
compared to what FoH does compared to other guilds in EQ
