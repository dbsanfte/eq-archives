Those people are idiots.

The level 56 res costs *600* mana.  That puts a severe limit on how fast a
Cleric can res a bunch of people.  An epic Cleric, on the other hand, is
only limited by the casting time of the epic, which is a hell of a lot
shorter than the time it take to med 600 mana.

This makes a *huge* difference on raids when there is a wipe out.  Without
epic Clerics, it is often not possible to res the party fast enough to
handle repops, and the raid has to resort to dragging/summoning back to some
safe spot for resing, basically starting over.  With an epic Cleric or two,
there's a much better chance of having time to res in place and get
recovered and ready before the repops.
