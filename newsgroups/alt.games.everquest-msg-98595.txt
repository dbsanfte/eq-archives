I wish they would make the auction command work only in certain area's like
market places etc... and in the market places you would have a item portal.

For example:

you do an auction to sell something.
the only people that hear this are people in the market places all over
norath.
if someone wants to buy it they place the item/money in the portal
idicaticating what player it is for and a normal trade window pops up. So
you can sell items easy that way and also make use of the dead zone areas
that can be come market areas.
Of course if a player is in the same zone you just trade as normal ;)
