To me there's little difference between "good" and "entertaining"
movies (RHPS being one of the obvious exceptions).  All of the 4
Kurosawa movies I mentioned are very good and very entertaining.

When I want entertainment in music, I generally listen to AC/DC and
Bach.  (I never seem to listen to music for enlightenment.)

Possibly.  I'm Canadian, so my knowledge base is somewhat skewed from
the US "standard".
