That list, unfortunatley doesn't mention any of the hindraces (take druisd
for example - a lot of their spells are outdoor only, and their dots/dd's
are inferior to other classes, as well as their healing ability from about
40 on up until the get their version of CHeal.)

Rogue, you can add lockpicking to the list - there are some places that
require a rogue with 200 lockpicking skill to get into, but your list a is
decent generalization - just have to realize that along with it, there are
also downsides.
