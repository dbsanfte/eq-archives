I was checking out my lvl 22 rogue's skills last night, and realized that 
my wonderful soloing of Balanof had allowed me to max offense and defense, 
but my backstabbing was a paltry 75 or so.

Here's the question:  How can I raise this skill the fastest (reletively)?  
I had read somewhere that there are certain mobs you can use - such as a 
soulbinder - and that you can duel another player.  Any other way?

Thanks

----
Balanof 22 Rogue of E'ci
