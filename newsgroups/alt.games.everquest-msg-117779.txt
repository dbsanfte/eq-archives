Necromancers can also both locate and track a corpse.  Obviously they don't
have tracking as an ability, but they do get a spell for it.  I'm curious,
what's the work-around for not having the person as a target when you cast
the spell?  I have actually been in a situation where I needed to find
someone's corpse, to bring to a cleric, when the person was bound on another
continent.  Also, is the work-around for bards only, or for necro and SK
locate corpse as well?
