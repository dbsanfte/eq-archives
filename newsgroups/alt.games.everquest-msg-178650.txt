Paludal is THE place to go up until level 21 or 22.  You can stretch it out
a little farther, but the two camps that are good past then are hotly
contested and a continuing source of drama in /ooc and /shout.  Find a good
place in the tunnels and kill mushrooms, burrowers, and shiknars.

How good is the XP there?  This weekend, I took a twink SK and cleric in
there for powerleveling with wife's 44 druid.  Got them from 12 to 21.

Around 19 or so, the spot I was at started to turn light blue, so I decided
to try something else.  I went to Netherbian Lair and attacked some trogs. 
I killed one red trog and two yellows, but it was a very near thing, even
with the druid babysitting - they hit hard, and druid machine was a few
steps away.  

So I went back to Paludal, but in a different spot.  I got more XP killing
three blue mobs there than I did killing the red and two yellows.  Noticably
more.  I'd say 1/4 blue more.

Is it just me or is there something wrong with that?
