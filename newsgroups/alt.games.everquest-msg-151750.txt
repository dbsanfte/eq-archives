Summon?  Forage!

All classes can melee quite effectively at lower levels.  As you move
up, the lower multiple on the skill cap (5 for melee and hybrid, 4 for
priests, 3 for wizards) and the addition of more and more melee
skills for the melee classes seperates this out.  Druids can melee
effectively longer than wizards can... but never all that well.  After all,
they aren't clerics.

Compared to a wizard?  If you were going to allow comparison, then
you'd have to put this in the Pros column, as they do have access to
better armor than wizards.  On the other hand, you are discussing the
difference between a two ply and a one ply tissue paper in the face
of mobs that require half inch steel plate.

Actually, a 10 druid on an account with a 35 wizard could get
some great armor... for his level, that and a nice for his level
weapon would make him into a meleeing machine for a while.

But if you want a melee character really, then make a monk,
who can sponge damage close to a warrior and deal damage
close to a rogue.
