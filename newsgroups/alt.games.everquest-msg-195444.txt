That's an excellent point.  Back when there was a lot of argument
about what value a Wizard did or did not bring to a group there
were a lot of calculations about DPS and etc.  But I cannot recall
a single case of somebody parsing xp/time with and without a Wizard
in a group.  I didn't get to group with Wizards very often, but I
sure noticed that everything went lots smoother in groups with
skilled Wizards.  Same for all casters really, but only the Cleric's
healing and Enchanter's crowd control seemed to be recognized by
other players as being responsible for group success.  And since
pets were presumed to break mez routinely (sure looked rare to me)
and nukes were considered a "poor use of mana", Magicians, Wizards,
and Necros were considered bad grouping casters, while Druids were
considered weak because they had neither CHeal nor Slow.
