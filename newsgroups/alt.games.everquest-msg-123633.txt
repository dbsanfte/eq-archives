I've yet to see any controlled reproducible experiments to either support 
or disprove the theory that Cha affects charming or fearing.  There seems 
to be much anecdotal evidence on both sides of the issue.  Personally, I 
really doubt it makes a difference, but I have 255 Cha most of the time 
anyway, so anyone in my group that believes it has an effect can feel all 
comfy and safe. :)

I'd -really- like to see some concrete testing done.  If there is an 
effect, even a very minor one, it'd be really cool to know if there's any 
soft caps or whatnot, points where more Cha stops making a difference...

So somebody go do that for me, would ya? :) Really, I'd do it myself, but 
I'm late for the raid... :)
