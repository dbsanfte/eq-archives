And I still stand by my original statement (not included in your response) that
even if you kill everything and nothing trains, you just wiped out a bunch of
mobs that others could have gotten experience off of. From the 14th level ranger
to you, people seem to be saying that AoE's don't start trains there. Well,
you've been really lucky. With my wizard I cast an AoE there on one of my first
ventures in, standing over near the doorway to head downstairs, and brought up
the train from hell.  I was promptly chastized by many in the zone. It can and
does happen. YMMV.
