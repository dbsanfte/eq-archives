Oooooooh, ok.  Clever joke but way over our heads...we're computer geeks,
not fishing geeks. :p

I don't think I'm alone in either not assigning a meaning other than the
word "troll" to a troll post, thinking about EQ trolls for some reason (but
trolls are usually dumbasses, like EQ trolls so I guess it fits) or Tolkien
trolls (nasty stupid creatures).  I RARELY think of the mariner definition.
