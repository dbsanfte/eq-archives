>If i am not anon I get tells from every zone of Norrath and Luclin begging.

Fortunately for me most newbies don't know about the buffing abilities of
shamans, but I am starting to get some of that myself and it really sucks!
Most of the people that beg simply have no common sense or courtesy at all.
I have had people run right up to me in the middle of a tough fight and ask
for a sow.  The other night I was helping a friend in Paludal and this
stupid monk kept begging for buffs.  I buffed him a little and then sat down
to med.  The moron then pulled two MOBs right on top of us and nearly got us
all killed because I was low health/mana.  He did get killed (losing the
buffs I just gave him) and when he got back says to me "ok just need AGI and
I'll be gtg"

That's what made me think about all this KEI stuff.  It just seems to have
gotten way out of control and seems much worse than sow/gate/rezz tells.
