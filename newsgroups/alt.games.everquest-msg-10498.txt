Okay... firstly... DON'T PLAY YOUR NEXT CHARACTER AS A HUMAN

You'd be amazed how much better it is playing a race that has infravision
(and the first time you either play a Dark Elf or get someone to cast
Serpent Sight on you, you'll wonder how you EVER got by without Ultravision
*grin*)

If you want to experiment a bit before settling on a class you really want
to ADVANCE with (as opposed to just getting the hang of different
combinations), then can I suggest one or more of the following...

Dwarven Cleric... can solo to around 20, but you should never HAVE to solo
with a cleric

Troll Shadowknight... will level VERY SLOWLY, but it's a blast to be able to
weild a 2-hander and STILL Slam/Bash... and Regen and a pet aren't too
shabby, either

Erud or High Elf Magician or Wizard... Mages can solo to 50, Wizards need to
group after 4... but both classes NEED higher Intelligence than a human can
ever supply

Dark Elf or Gnome Necromancer... Necros can solo AND group... and they're
pretty easy to level early on. Gnomes have better faction, but DEs are just
cooler.

Halfling or Barbarian Rogue... Misty Thicket is a great place to get a new
character started... or playing a catburglar that can benchpress 300lbs

Half Elf Bard... a tricky class to play, but will start in an area you're
familiar with (Qeynos or Freeport)

Iksar Monk or Shaman (if you have Kunark)... Verant seem to have taken a lot
of trouble over the newbie areas for Iksar... plenty of cash early on, and
lots of newbie quests (some of which even work!) *grin*

I'd give warriors, palladins and rangers a miss for now... you can always
come back and try them later on. Enchanters should be saved until you've
tried other pure casters (High Elves have the best combination of Int and
Charisma). Druids... hmmm... only advice I could give here is to avoid
trying to be a human druid... kiting in the dark when you can't see is NOT a
good idea.
