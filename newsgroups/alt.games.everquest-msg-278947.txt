I went to Nek castle last night on Lavastorm and we had this problem
too. We couldnt open the doors and we couldnt get the locket quest
again. I guess it is just  abug that needs to be fixed. 

I wish it wasnt bugged though, we would have finished 5 heritage quest
with the death of Lord Everling and our guild would have reached level
15 :(
