Ok, to my understanding, you need to approach some named drake in
Skyshrine and either do his quest (involving getting into Kael
etc which sounds hairy), or just kill him. I guess the latter
option is what people normally do, or is the Kael quest doable
without faction (i.e. sneak in with invis to the mob and start
talking at destination to some indiff mob). If killing is the
better option, what do you need for it (hard to get to?). Is
a group of 6 balanced players enough?
