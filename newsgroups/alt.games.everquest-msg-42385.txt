I realize that as a top poster you are more interested in what you have
to say rather than following a discussion and joining in appropriately,
but take a moment to go back and follow this part of the thread. 
Someone named Thomas is discussing his feeling that envy is the root of
the problem and if those lower level characters could just get over
theirs higher level people wouldn't have any issue with taking what they
pleased.  I pointed out that his argument could just as easily be used
to support the concept of higher level characters getting over their
envy.  Then you seem to have made this leap.... "So if say a 51 warrior
who cannot really solo wanted to gain a item he would..."  I am really
curious what this "So" is doing in there.  Did you think that I said
something about this theoretical lvl 51 char?  I didn't.  I was pointing
out that envy cuts both ways and that those of any level who would point
fingers at others should look within as well.  I also think that folks
would be happier if more people cared less about stupid things like
their lvl 51 warrior not having some silly trinket.  Of course I also
think folks would be happier if less folks top posted so what ya gonna
do?
