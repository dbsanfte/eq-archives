Xanthus [8/31/2001-3:22:59 PM]  Comments[45] 

Seattle Times recently posted a story about Federal agents seizing 10 
computers from a local teen suspected of Hacking in EverQuest. Here 
is a snipplet from the article: 

The hacking provided the intruder with information that allowed him 
to surreptitiously access the home computers of McQuaid � an icon 
among Internet gaming enthusiasts and the producer of "EverQuest,"
considered the most popular online role-playing game ever � and two 
Sony "game masters," responsible for the operation of "EverQuest," 
the affidavit says.

In McQuaid's computer, the hacker copied a voluminous file containing 
the blueprint for the release of the game's next version, "EverQuest2," 
scheduled for release next year. Other personal and proprietary
information was also accessed.

Head over to Seattle Times for the rest of the article.

Hacking of Web game EverQuest linked to local teen 

By Mike Carter
Seattle Times staff reporter

Federal agents have seized 10 computers and other computer gear from
the home of a Snoqualmie teen suspected of hacking into Sony's
extremely popular online game "EverQuest." 

The hacking would have given him access to personal information on
hundreds of thousands of players and Sony employees. 

Agents also say the hacker, who was 17 at the time, was able to access the
home computer of the company's vice president of product development,
Brad McQuaid, and downloaded documents for an as-yet-unreleased
version of the popular role-playing fantasy game. 

Sony, which declined comment on the investigation, says the game is
played by as many as 400,000 people worldwide and reaps more than $50
million a year in revenue. 

No arrests have been made, and no charges have been filed, said Deborah
Hartman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego,
where Sony Online is based. 

A search warrant filed recently in U.S. District Court in Seattle shows that
FBI computer-crime agents seized 10 computers and dozens of computer
drives and disks from the home two weeks ago. Agents are also
investigating a Mobile, Ala., man over the intrusions. 

The warrant says the U.S. Attorney's Office suspects the men of crimes
that could put them in federal prison for up to five years. 

Last October, authorities say, the men broke into one of the 40 servers
Sony Online uses to operate the game and gained access to a powerful
"superuser" account. 

Through that account, they gained access to the private accounts of Sony
employees, a password-protected messaging board and "all other
customer accounts." 

"Access to these accounts gives the superuser an individual's name, date
of birth, work and home telephone numbers, Internet protocol address
and other information," including home addresses, according to an affidavit
filed with the warrant. 

Moreover, superuser status also "enables the user to have complete
administrative controls over the game, including the suspension, banning
and unbanning of accounts." 

Sony Online officials told agents several accounts were tampered with
during this time period, including one belonging to the Alabama suspect. 

The hacking provided the intruder with information that allowed him to
surreptitiously access the home computers of McQuaid � an icon among
Internet gaming enthusiasts and the producer of "EverQuest," considered
the most popular online role-playing game ever � and two Sony "game
masters," responsible for the operation of "EverQuest," the affidavit says. 

In McQuaid's computer, the hacker copied a voluminous file containing the
blueprint for the release of the game's next version, "EverQuest2,"
scheduled for release next year. Other personal and proprietary
information was also accessed. 

For reasons unexplained, the hacker sent all of the proprietary files that
were hacked to a Sony executive, "making it evident that (he) had illegally
obtained the files." Until then, Sony Online Entertainment was unaware of
the extent of the intrusion. 

Sony Online had experienced a series of security problems they now
attribute to the two suspects. 

A private, password-protected "guide board," used by "EverQuest"
operators to communicate with one another, was posted on HackerQuest,
an Internet bulletin board frequented by game players. 

Later, a Sony game master, Alan Crosby, was contacted anonymously
through a private e-mail system by one of the hackers. 

Sony Online officials were able to trace the contact to the teenager in
Snoqualmie.
