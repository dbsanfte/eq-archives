I notice that Xornn's is starting to show its age in small, but
appreciable ways. There's no mention of spells 51+ in the "spell
lines" section. And, the statement that "AE mez can not be overwritten
by single mez" hasn't been true for a while. I suspect that it hasn't
been updated since Kunark went live, but for all that, it's remarkably
useful.
