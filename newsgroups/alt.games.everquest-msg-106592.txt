I should have known better than to followup on a bizbee post in
fullflow with a differing viewpoint, I guess. My take on this is
that the usage of OOC for out of character chat is as in line with
its purpose as the use of auction for auction; the point was that
simple.

Yes yes, I can see you disagree but wait till you've read to the
end of the post before posting the vitriolic rebuttal. You always
seem to post as you read, and it can mean you miss some of the
points as they're built.

Seems is used here as shorthand for "seems to me", used , of course,
to make it absolutely clear that this is opinion - you'll note I
didnt claim VI had stated this at all, although your particular
straw man seems to... oh wait, here's a useful quote...

Strange. You appear to be doing just that yourself.

And with no definition for overuse, which is a subjective term, all
we can do is say what that would seem (that horrible vague word
again, I know) to mean to us.... but...

Ahh, I see you anticipated me. Of course, this clarifies nothing;
the point of diminishing returns, or the definitions of its synonyms
are all just as subject to interpretation. With no definition of
what is "too often" we are left to judge that ourselves; and here,
it would appear, our judgements differ.

Why bizbee, you old VAK, you. Actually no, I'm not convinced they
would.  Theres a very useful thing about terms that require
interpretation, and thats that they can be interpreted as required
at the point of enforcement, by the person called upon to enforce
the rules in question.

That I can agree should go to tells; but in fact, the example that
started this "conversation" we're having was of somebody asking a
question that developed into a zonewide discussion with input from
multiple interested parties. Seems appropriate to me.

Of course, thats not what I said. Again.

Well, I'm bright enough not to med at the zoneline while low on
health, and my personal opinion is that a train warning is the ideal
oppurtunity for shout rather than auction or ooc or any of the other
channels (guild chat perhaps? ;) )... but yeah, trains happen.
Sometimes I dont see a shout because of combat spam, soemtimes
because Im not looking, sometimes because I have channels turnd
off.

Do I bitch and whine? Not really. I think its polite to give a
warning of a train, sure, and I do it myself, but there are times
I have little sympathy for people caught in them.

I'm really trying hard not to caveat everything I say here with
huge and long treaty-style definitions of what I mean as this is
just an informal newsgroup so please dont start telling me I've
just promoted training everyone as AOK and a responsible thing to
do ;)

One of the reasons I have no problem with it is I always feel free
to turn it off if I want the peace and quiet... and honestly, I
cant recall the last time I saw a zonewide chat session so prolific
I felt it qualified as "abuse", or that even lasted beyond 5 minutes
exchange.

I play a fair amount right now, so I dont think its just that I'm
"sheltered", although as I said, I avoid LOIO and Velketors like
the plague.

Well sure, for one use of OOC, or ignorance of the rules, or wilful
misinterpretation of them (I know, I know, you're going to tell me
I'm wilfully misinterpreting them, but swear to whatever god you
believe in, this is my honest take. Guess that makes me a fool.) -
I meet a fair share of idiots too, but hey, its a multiplayer game.
That means multiple players, not all of whom I get on with... kind
of off the point of this particular conversation I guess.

Anyway.... Not a conversation that seems to be going anywhere. We
interpret a section of the rules differently, and I remain unconvinced
by your helpful quoting of, to me, unenlightening dictionary
definitions, as, I'm sure, you remain unconvinced by my position.

Boohoo. I'm sure we'll both lose sleep over it ;)
