Last night, I was having several issues. Not the least of which was I
crashed 4-5 times last night alone, and each time, it was raining. No rain =
no crash. But I also had problems targeting/right clicking on corpses. Had
to climb inside cyclops corpses in OOT in order to loot them, and in once
case, I couldn't loot at all, had to get my pet...er, I mean, my character's
brother, the warrior...to loot. Occasionally I had trouble targeting the
living cyclopses (cyclopsi?) as well.
