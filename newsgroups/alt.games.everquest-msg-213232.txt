True. The point is that it's rather disturbing that the man who is
supposed to be the leader and a shining example of our Constitution
has such flagrant disregard for it when it comes to anything outside
of his own religion.

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.

-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 

(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
