Yeah, if you are already bored at 10, get out.
You only get more bored later. Some people say they 
don't have fun until level 60 or something, in that case why play
forever leveling up to 60 while not having fun? Some game that is!

It is better around 19 or 20, though. Overall the game is fairly
boring. You kind of do the same things over and over again. Quests are
usually based on rare mobs with rare drops, with the double rare
difficulty making the quest suck (its not even real "difficulty" but
rather is just a test of your patience) 

Tradeskills are the thing that is the worst in that regard, you have
to skill up randomly on crap in order to then find very rare
drops/spend lots of money getting rare drops to probably fail on
things actually worth making. Games coming out, such as WOW, are doing
this in better ways by having you get skill points when you level that
you can put into areas like tradeskill. Then you simply either have
enough skill or don't. Your goal if you don't have enough skill is
much more clear, its level to get more skill points rather than stand
there and make lanterns. 

In spite of recent improvements, I'd call the entire game design
"tedious." It seems really outdated today.
