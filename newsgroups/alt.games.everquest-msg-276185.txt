In WoW, if you don't get your corpse, one way or another...you don't play. 
It's much more realistic, to me, to be a ghost having to return to your 
body, than to be perfectly sound and fleshed out while your corpse is lying 
around somewhere. True, you can get the big ghost lady to rez you, but at a 
big cost...75% damage to all your armor and weapons, whether worn or in your 
bags. This can cost quite a bit of coinage to fix. Getting back to your 
corpse is rarely a problem in WoW, but rezzing around your corpse can 
be...especially if you died in the middle of a bunch of mobs that will aggro 
on you as soon as you rez. In which case you'll most likely die again...and 
have to do the whole thing over once more, hopefully having gotten far 
enough away for it to 'stick' this time.

However, I'm confused when you say you 'lose some experience in WoW'...I've 
never lost experience, that I've noticed, from dying. As far as I know, 
there is no experience loss in WoW, just durability loss on your items.

And then there's the best thing about WoW of all...no zoning! Seemless 
transitioning from one zone to another (the only exception being 
continent-to-continent travel or going into an instanced zone).

I still love EQ1, don't get me wrong, but...I have cancelled my 
subscription, since WoW is just, to me, a much better overall experience.
