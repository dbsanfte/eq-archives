    Actually not being a paladin my options do not include either stuns or
root. As an SK my options are:

    a) obtain agro (eight thousand points of it)

    OR

    b) fear mez the mob. Resistable and fraught with danger.

    Neither option comes anywhere near close to 100% success, and in the
case of an 8 thousand point deficit I'd say nine times out of ten that
wizard is paste. The pallies options are just as resistable, but probably
more likely to save the wizard's life. OTOH the SK will do slightly more
damage to the mob once agro is regained.

    As I said before, I don't play a warrior, I don't know what they need,
but I can tell you that 100% success taunt is absolutely off the wall, and
suggesting that knights have any sort of 100% ability is just as nuts.

    Bullshit. They're the best for most groups, they're the best for raids,
and they do more damage. The problem, methinks, is being slightly blown out
of proportion. I'll freely agree that pure casters are overpowered compared
to melees, we all see evidence of that every day - but the suggestion that
warriors need to be the best raid tank and the best group tank in EVERY
situation is an absolute load. If knights are better in a few situations,
well, it's a bout time.

    And more hitpoints, dual weild, more dps, better mitigation, warrior
equipment focuses more on AC and less on magic than sk/pally gear
generally... I must stress I don't WANT these things, I'm happy with an SK -
but I'm not happy if warriors end up with the only thing that we're better
than them at for groups.

    Why does warriors soloing keep coming up? We're talking about grouping
aren't we? If warriors are going to be viable soloists, improving their
taunt isn't going to help whatsoever.

    The cleric will have to heal others more often - true - which is why
pallies and sk's make better main tanks for those groups where casters NEED
to cast on resisty mobs that do a stupendous amount of damage but are still
doable by a group. Where are these mobs? PoP. Are warriors more accepted as
a group main tank in just about every pre-pop situation? Or am I imagining
that?

    So MT with a knight, or use a knight to gain agro and let the warrior
taunt it off him.

    Nope, I don't understand why soloing keeps coming up. So far as I can
see it has no relevance to agro holding abilities whatsoever.

    Yah its a silly situation but an unavoidable one. If the game
prioritises so much on grouping I think it needs to make grouping more
rewarding (for the AVERAGE group not the best group you ever had or the best
thing an uber guild can stick together). On the other hand if grouping were
more rewarding without any change to how it actually worked I'd probably
still solo. Maybe I just need to find some people its more fun to group with
hmmm

    Well, a solution to that would be an improved warrior bind wounds skill,
to bring them closer to knight self healing levels. (SK's are actually crap
at self healing, but they do get fear (that eventually becomes a nice spell
to use at 49))

    I think saying "warriors can't group" is a very silly over the top
statement. A more realistic statement, correct me if I'm wrong here, might
be "Warriors are having more trouble than they used to finding groups at the
top end of the game because knights are a better tank overall for pop groups
because their superior agro holding abilities puts them ahead in that
particular theatre"

    I still have to see I see SK's and pallies repeating their '/ooc lfg' a
lot more often than I see warriors doing it - yes I'm not in the planes, but
that's my point. Everywhere else they're generally still preferred.

    A warrior's main method of building agro is actually their DPS, which by
the end of any fight is bound to add up to a hell of a lot more than
taunt-jumps and procs got them.

    A more correct statement would be "If warriors are to resume their
predominance over knights in pop groups, they need another way of generating
agro". If they're not going to squish us out again, they don't need another
way of generating agro.

    Well raiding isn't the point of the game for me at the moment, because
my guild doesn't raid that often, but for most people it does seem to be the
end goal, and if a class is vastly more desired for a raid than another
class, it follows that that class should have some balancing disadvantages,
lest everybody be a warrior.

    Hang on a second here.... are you comitting the "too uber to judge"
error? When's the last time you played a level 30 cleric?

    In pop groups, or in situations where casters lack agro management
skills.

    No, that's toning it down too much. I'm not concerned that warriors will
be "better competition" for the knight classes, I'm concerned that they will
once again rise above us to the point where a group with a warrior generally
wont bother with a knight (if they know their business).

    Substantially less useful in pop groups. Rare indeed is the pre-pop
group that will choose a knight over a warrior. This might only be because
people have yet to join the dots and see the pony, but there we are.

    I think warriors would be a lot more fun to play if they could solo
more, and a simple bind wound fix would help that a lot. I don't agree that
they need to be better than knights in EVERY grouping situation.
