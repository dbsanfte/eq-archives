My L5 Wood Elf Ranger just started fletching.  At first I was 
disappointed because I was getting no success, but after some practice I 
can make the easiest arrows most of the time.  I use them to draw 
critters to me so I won't have to leave the trails and get turned around 
in the woods at night, and to shoot at Orcs when I'm too beat up to join 
the melee hand-to-hand.  Plus your Archery skill increases just by 
shooting them off, so there's a perfectly good excuse to go out murdering 
helpless Black Wolves and Giant Wasp Drones and stuff.  The cheap arrows 
are 9c each and I can make 5 for 24c, so if I use about six million of 
them I'll have made up the cost of the fletching kit!  But anyway, 
fletching is cool, and any Wood Elf worth his salt should be a master of 
all things related to Archery, sez I. ^_^  

And who knows, maybe it will pay off later.

Have fun...
