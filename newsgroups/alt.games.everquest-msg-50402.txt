I mentioned this topic a couple days ago...   I was noticing a lot of
selling and little buying in NFP and Kal and Kelethin, etc...   Anyways, I
have an idea that would make the prices skyrocket....  Why don't you all
"Destroy" your uber items.  Then the suplly will drop drasticly and thus the
price on the street will go up...  it may take a little longer for the price
to go up than the supply to go down but hey, you have just increased the
demand above the supply   :)
