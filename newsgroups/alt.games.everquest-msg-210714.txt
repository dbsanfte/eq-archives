Actually they can, but there's a wierd cutoff. If the mob is below 20% (I
think, could be 10%) and the wave would kill it, the wave is resisted
automatically.  If the mob is above the cutoff, there's no autoresist
check. You could verify this out by using your L34 Lavastorm in the Qeynos
newbie gardens and see that it does in fact kill bats and snakes and stuff.
