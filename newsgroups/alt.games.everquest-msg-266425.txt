Why? Because I really don't have at my disposal better 'real world' 
examples of other definitions of human beings that have been used.

I could move this to the hypothetical but the 'real world' examples, 
while extreme, are adequate, and make the point satisfyingly  visceral.

(As an aside, the definition of murder includes the necessity of intent, 
which is virtually impossible to establish. For a word with a very 
specific meaning, its really hard to nail it down.)

There was no factual incorrectness in his statement.

To simplify:

p = 'human beings' includes 'fetuses'
q = 'terminating fetuses' is 'murder'

The op effectively stated:
if p then q

And you countered:
~p therefore ~q

First off your argument is a fallacious argument form (denying the 
antecedent), and second it doesn't even argue the point. 

The real point of contention is the definition of human beings! (That's 
what makes it a semantic argument.) I'm sure you are quite prepared to 
agree with his claim that if fetuses were human beings then terminating 
them would be murder.

And it should go without saying that you can't resolve a dispute on what 
the definition -should- be (ie what a human being -is-), by invoking the 
-current definition-.

Obviously doing that leads to the absurdities of logic and dogma that 
Faned and I pointed out with respect to Blacks and Jews.

It wasn't a case of getting at what you meant vs what you said. You 
approached a semantic argument wrongly. It was absurd.

So you can't go and 'disprove' someones statement by invoking 
definitions when the definitions are themselves not agreed upon.

It was a long post, with a great deal of rhetoric. In truth I'd have 
come down on your side as often as I came down on the OPs. But it was 
much too broad, with far to many subtopics to make it a coherent 
discussion.

Point conceded. However, I actually followed up to Faned's post. At 
which point the 'one weak point' was the -entire context-.

As to calling you a twit, I think your reading to much into that. It was 
a foolish mistake you made. Faned, and then myself, reduced it to 
absurdity, and at that point is seemed fitting to describe someone still 
clinging to it as a twit. (Based on your reply to Faned I'd say you've 
distanced yourself from the argument so its rather moot.)
