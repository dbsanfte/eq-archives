Me too.

Yes, I do get critical update notifications on W2k every couple of weeks or
so, but the OS has been rock solid.  I have never had it crash on my setup.

I also use MS Office, for the same reasons that many others have stated
here, at the time I was looking for a spreadsheet and word processor, it was
superior to the competition, or at least the ones I tried.  Since then, I
continue to use it, because it does everything I need it to do, and I don't
really feel like learning a new product, because it might be better in some
way.
