I just bought the most expensive one I could find, cost me a
whopping 6 adventure points, turns out its +5 int in my charm
slot when inside an LDoN.  Figured I might as well put something
there and charms are hard to come by, plus now I can put my
adventurer's stone on it as well.

When I get up into my 60s and get some POP flags I'll ditch it in
favor of the POP charm, but till then a no stats one doesn't hurt
and it -does- at least have a little bit of stat to it when on a
mission.
