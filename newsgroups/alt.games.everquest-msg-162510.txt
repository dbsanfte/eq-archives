I have. I have played 60+ druids and rangers both, a lot.

You're clearly insane if you think that ranger bow soloing is in any sense
of the word overpowered. Compared to other techniques available to other
classes or even the fear kiting available to rangers, its ludicrously
bad going. It just about covers the LFG time in plane of valor and is useful
because pitiful XP is better than no XP while waiting around, but trust
me here - comparing number of mobs killed to just about any other
viable soloing technique isnt going to show a soloing ranger with EQ and
AM3 shining as an XP machine.

Quadding is everything its cracked up to be. Maybe you are doing something
wrong. Even root rotting, which you seem to regard as inefficient, is awesome
on places like the halls of honour. What, we're not talking about the high
end game? Quadding in cobalt scar in the mid 40-s early 50-s again, took
about half a mana pool and resulted in insanely good experience by comparison
to any alternative levelling means.

I agree the root nerf isnt that big of a deal; but equally, I think trying
to justify it on the basis that 'root archery rangers are overpowered' is
absurd when compared to the established soloing mechanisms.

Absolute tosh. You ARE doing something wrong if you can only quad low
blues.

I agree that the root thing is a storm in a teacup. I disagree with the
idea quadding isnt by far the best method of soloing available, or that
root/archery even remotely comes near competing with it.

To be honest, you're talking like somebody, to borrow your means of argument,
who has never actually root/archeried and has spoken to someone pleased
with their own achievements once or twice. The fact you play a druid and
dont think quadding is as effective as all that just blows my mind. Have
you played another class and tried to solo?
