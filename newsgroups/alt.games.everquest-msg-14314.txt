While running through on my way back from banking in Grobb I ran into some real
ones that had been trained (or kited..... what's the difference in Oasis? LOL!)
and I happened to con them. To my great surprise, one was yellow and one was
BLUE. So........ wanna get a few more folks together and gank a couple? I've
been waiting for revenge on those bastards for some time now. I wonder if my
time has come?
