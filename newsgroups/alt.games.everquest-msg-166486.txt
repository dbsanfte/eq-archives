A number of years back I had a problem where my left eye (eyelid?) would
twitch suddenly at irregular intervals. After a couple of months I went
to see the doctor about it. Doctor said to get more sleep. I got more
sleep, twitching stopped.

This was before EQ even existed. Basically it starts happening if I start
averaging less than about 6.5 hours/night.

However, this problem sounds like something else - it's a twitch behind
the eye rather than of the eye, or eyelid, itself. Could be related though.
Or it could simply be the ergonomics of his gaming system - the monitor is
too close or at the wrong angle, something like that...

IANAD (I Am Not A Doctor), so take this for what it's worth.
