Have not yet come across an old world mob that my ranger has problems
tanking (within a reasonable level range).

FR + some hp buffs = win...the dot (3 waves  of 1000 or so I think) isnt
that bad with a single healer, but you are better off taking a group as you
have to get the guy to spawn in the first place (assuming he is not already
up), and dont want to mess up on the tear hand in (plane of fear...is pretty
nasty).

Of course a 65 (anything) could probably tank the guy, considering when he
was put into the game and how far people have come since.  Considering how
easy it is to get to 65 now, I cant see how any of the epics will really be
epic anymore (which of course, cannot  be helped in a game of this nature,
unless they updated the epics / rewards with each expansion, which we all
know is never likely to happen).
