    It used to take your position as the mob whose eyes you were looking
out, roughly. So you could "bind sight hop" all the way deep into a dungeon,
assuming the mobs co-operated. Then the guild that did this to locate the
entry to PoM mentioned how they did it. BOOM, nerfed ASAP. Now your position
is your real position, so the limited range on Bind Sight doesn't allow you
to hop your way deep into a dungeon.
