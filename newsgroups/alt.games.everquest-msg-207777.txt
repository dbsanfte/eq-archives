You can do any of the scouts in any order. if by some chance you lose the
seal at any time you just go back to Shar Vahl and talk to the animist who
gave you the seal and ask for another.

The fight in permafrost is the worst, BUT be careful not to fall into the
traps in the floor on your way there or you will have 6 bears aggroing on
you at the same time.

The willowisp in stonebrunt spawns on top of the mountain above the
waterfall, so since it is hard to get up that slippery slope you might want
to have your help  stationed up there before you do the handin.

The others are pretty easy can do with 1 good group. Should have a druid or
ranger to track the spirits after turn in. The Scout in Emerald jungle is in
a spot with lots of wandering mobs nearby.
