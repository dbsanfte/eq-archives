I admit it.. I'm one of those idiot higher levels that farms Hill
Giants in Rathe.  No great joy do I get in depriving people of
experience, but I can make 500 PP an hour easily with Dogdog doing
most of the killing, 4-5 at a time.  Not much uber equip here, still
holding onto my JBB though for greenies.

There must be a better way to make cash for a solo, unflagged shaman,
is there not?  Seeing how I still can't afford my level 60 spells
(Torpor + Malo = 120K on my server), I can't bear the thought of
having to kill this many Hill Giants.

Get me out of Hill Giant Hell, please!  Email me or respond here if ya
like.
