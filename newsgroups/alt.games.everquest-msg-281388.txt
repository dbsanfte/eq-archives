Not really. How many players do you think can play 24x7 (or organize 
shifts to cover a spawn 24x7? How many players do you think have an idle 
p4 they could dedicate to the task of botting?

Its a matter of scale. Rampant botting would be able to tie up for more 
of the game than no-lifers will ever be able to.

When you go to a major movie release and have to stand in line, you have 
to concede the first positions to the dorks who camped overnight, or all 
week. Big deal... now if everyone in the city could 'bot that line 
grabbing you'd be forced to bot because now instead of being 30th in 
line... you'd be 25,000th. See the difference?

So your solution to the problem is out-jerk them? Good job.

Because cheating isn't terribly prevalent in EQ. There aren't scores of 
bots running around grinding xp 24x7.

No.

Just as being 5th in line because the 4 people ahead of you got their 
first feels quite different than being 5th in line because the 4 people 
ahead of you just cut-in.
