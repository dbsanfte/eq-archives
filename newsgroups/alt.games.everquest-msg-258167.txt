Yeah, I can understand them wanting to save space on their servers
by not saving all that stuff, and frankly it's sometimes handy that
I can edit my macros and screen layout by changing files on my box.
But it can be killer using someone else's box.  Literally.  I was at
a friend's house and was doing some faction-quest turn-ins, when I
decided to check my current faction with various NPCs.  Turned out
the key I use for "select nearest NPC", namely backquote (`), was
the key he uses for turning on autoattack (from the days when the
default was "a").

Fortunately I managed to feign death before either killing something
and messing up the factions I'd been working on, or getting killed
myself.
