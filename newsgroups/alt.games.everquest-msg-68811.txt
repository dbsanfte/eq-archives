Eh, 'twas the TLC that drove me away. TLC on a roleplay
server is dumb beyond words... 'You easily beat this
monster, so you won't get the quest item you killed it
for'. Oh yeah, that makes sense!

Oh, I guess the language restrictions would get
honorable mention, too... Not being able to
communicate with others in a multiplayer game is too
much.

Lore items I don't mind so much, they can be explained
with roleplaying. Although a lot of rather mundane items
are lore in the current setup, so cutting down on them
would make sense. No drop? The epics, for sure, and some
other quest items (and ONLY quest items). And the message
would be changed when you tried to drop them, too, it'd
say something like "Try as you might, you can't make
yourself give the Sword of Uberness away" or something...

But you live near them! You could sneak in, ninja-style,
and change FV to your liking! Yeah!

And while you're in their HQ, give yourself a pony too!
Problem solved!

Hey! What happened to the previous Teacure? Coulda sworn
she was higher level?
