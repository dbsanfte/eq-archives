If you insist on quadding check out eqdruids.com lots of suggestions.
Quadding Hill giants is like herding pigs lol do it once to say ya did
then forget it.

The problem with quading in the mid 40s is your aoe is a bit weak to
take the mobs down before you run outa manna. To be honest quading has
only a few perfect level bands 39-43 , 49-52, 57-60 with some dead
spots in between. Notice this has to do with when you get a new aoe
and which mobs are dark blue at those levels. Also has to do with the
lay of the land, room to quad without adds for instance. Sure theres
mobs and zones that are quadable at these dead spots but not really
worth the effort to some of us. Root/Dot isnt all that bad youve done
it before, you will do it again. If you think its too slow start a
necro lol I did, no quadding but man what a kill rate and not near as
much fun.
For now snag an Ice giant camp in Everfrost and see how you fare. If
your wis or equipment isnt up to snuff they will show it. Moneys ok
too.
