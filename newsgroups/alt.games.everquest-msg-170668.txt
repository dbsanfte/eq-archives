Divine Arbitration;  its a POP era AA ability for clerics (perhaps paladins
too?)

Take all damage within the group, and redistribute it so everyone is down
by the same amount.

This results in a heal for the highly wounded.. and new damage for the
uninjured.

Works in around a second (there is a cast time, but its very short) and you
don't need a target, so its great for emergencies, expecially surprises
(like OMG chanter's being eaten by add and the MA will drop dead without a
massive heal)

Better still, there's absolutely no aggro for doing it (doesn't even put
you on the hate list if you aren't there already) which means in some POP
encounters, which can be deadly to healers due to some massive heal aggro
issues, its a godsend (so to speak)

But its important to note that if the MA is down 6000 hp, you are about to
be down 1000 each.  If there are more injured, it can be worse.  In the
incedent I was referring to in the original post, we were all down almost
2K hp after arbitration... not terrible for those of us buffed up over the
4K mark, but for an unbuffed wizard... I'd say his HP before arb was around
2500 and after... he looked like a handy snack!
