No, the corpse lasts 7 RL days, regardless of whether your are in the game
or out.  This was changed quite some time ago.  For levels 1 to 9, the
corpse lasts a short time, but, you respawn at bind with all equipment
during those levels.  For level 10+, the corpse lasts 7 days.  RL days, not
game days.
