I had a 4000 and did a significant amount of graphics programming for
it (only a 500MB drive though - I was so excited to get it for $550
or so).  When C= went out of business I started to really second guess
my choice of platforms.  At the time, the 68040 processorsin the 
Amiga A4000 was superior to the 486's, but there was no guarantee that
Motorola was going to continue that line (ended with the '060) or
that anyone would implement a processor upgrade using them.  So I 
waited while the value of my 4k climbed (as the only platform for 
the improved Video Toaster - used A4k's climbed back up to their 
original sale price) and sold it for a bit more than I payed. 

That machine was way ahead of it's time - a 25mhz/32bit/auto-configure
bus that predated PCI by several years (IIRC it had a burst mode where
the address lines were used to transfer data - memory on an expansion
card was just as fast as memory on the main bus); the 68040 was a superior
CPU (in FP performance and to write assembler too); A pre-emptive 
multitasking OS that wasn't bloated; True 32bit programming model (I
was appalled when I switched to coding Windows that I still had to
worry about near/far pointers and the like); and accelerated graphics
and sound hardware.

What I didn't like about it was the rabidly pro-Amiga anti-everything-
else attitude among the zealots - I've always been hardwar/OS/dev tool
agnostic, and I feel that sort of zealotry reflected badly on the
entire community.  That's a shame, because there was a tremendous open
source movement in that community..
