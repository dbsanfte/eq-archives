Experience for turning in items or cash.  Maybe Verant could expand it
to some common items, like paladin guildmasters wanting bone chips or
something.  :-)   
Actually, that's something that I miss with higher level characters.
Many of the lower level quests don't require multiple zones to
complete.  Most of the mid-level and high-level quests seem to involve
a lot of travel.  Compare the Mammoth calf hide quest with the Gem
Encrusted Gauntlets quest.  I'd be nice if I could turn in items from
tough monsters from only one zone like Giant toes.  Why is it gnoll
pup scalps and gnoll scalps are wanted, but not Ry'gorr scalps?  The
Colddain in CC seem to hate the Ry'gorr but the stingy dwarves there
won't pay a bounty in coin, exp, or faction.
