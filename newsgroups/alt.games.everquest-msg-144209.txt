Mages can do a form of this - Summon an MSII pet (no root but
as many HP as 49 earth - important for getting your mana back)
pull, let the pet beat it to within an inch of it's life, reclaim.
I did that for my cleric (he just nuked the last hp off) and
slowly gained mana over the course of the day.  Big thing is to
have a ready supply of mobs, and to make sure not to pull something
more than 6 levels above the PL'ee.  Nothing worse than following
a mob around wacking it's heals because you can't land a nuke on
it.

Since my buddy sort of co-opted the cleric (he's our regular 
group's MA and a RL friend, and doesn't trust me to keep him 
alive.  Something about that CH that hit him at 0% health the 
other day - Hey, just being efficient :-P) I decided to PL an 
enchanter with them, on his 2nd account.  Between gear and 
buffs he had 1k hp, so the 'chanter just summoned a pet and cast 
shallow breath + Mage DS.  23 in 7.5 hours :)  Now I have to
figure a good spot to switch to from PC - things are going light
blue there.

(of course, somewhere before 30 I have to go get a single needlite
in echo and let it beat on me for a while - Defense got a little
behind, 40 at 23.  Nice thing about them is how fast they hit.
if it weren't for the fact that there are only 7 of them on a 19
minute timer they'd be awesome to 31).

If any one can suggest a place with the kind of rapid spawn that
PC has, with mobs 22ish to 29ish, I'm all ears.  I can either DS,
tank and let pet finish as it runs, or when the cleric isn't available,
let a mage pet beat it silly, shallow breath and get hit with the
'chanter (to get the pet in, and do some damage) and reclaim when
it turns to run.

Any other bets I'm missing with that combo (mage+cleric to PL an
enchanter) I'd love to hear that too.
