It all sounds kinda like when KEI was available for all levels. It got
to the point where groups would grind to a halt while the cleric or
other casters ran to get KEI. Even as low as Paludal levels, I saw
groups refuse to take casters who had no KEI.

Even now, post 50 LDoN groups, I've seen a lot that won't go anywhere
until every mana user has KEI. On the up side, someone either has a
bot/friend who will do it for free or will pay for the group. I
honestly see a problem with any buff that is considered so essential
for a group to run. But, that's just me, I guess...
