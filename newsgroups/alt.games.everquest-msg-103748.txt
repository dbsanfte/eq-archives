It used to be amusing.

Beggar puts on tunic.
Beggar dies.
Beggar thinks "WTF hit me???"
Beggar loots corpse.
At this point, either the beggar realizes what happened, or:
Stupid beggar puts on tunic.
Stupid beggar dies.....

Now, it's hilarious:

Beggar puts on tunic.
Beggar dies.
Beggar respawns at bind point fully equipped.
Beggar dies.
Beggar respawns at bind point fully equipped.
Beggar dies.
.
.
.

You get the picture I'm sure.

I'm tempted to create a level 1 character just to verify this happens.
