Ok, just to clarify, I actually have to get HIT for a defense skill up
chance?  Misses or dodges don't count?

As an aside, my riposte and dodge are maxed.  I have tanked alot in
the past though the warrior has made strides in keeping aggro lately.
I've been hesistant to try and pull it from him just because I'm such
a wuss.  But if I need to actually get HIT (A mob001 hits you for 200
damage) then damnitall I'll take aggro!
