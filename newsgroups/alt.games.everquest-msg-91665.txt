Well, of course I would expect you to "defend" your awakening of him. Fair
enough.
But this is NOT about fighting some generic dragon model. This is NOT (only)
about getting hands on a few phat items. This is about seeing ST in all its
might and glory. Seeing the sleeping Sleeper (duh). And I do realize there's
something great about being able to say "I woke the Sleeper", but you DO
know he's unkillable, right? Then WHY DO IT?!

Now, you don't know me; I'm pretty sure about that. So how can you possibly
know what I'm working towards? And what makes you think that your "uber
guild" is the only one to ever visit ST on Zeb? I know there's a fair chance
I won't get there, but that certainly doesn't mean I'm not hoping to!
As far as I'm concerned, ST is THE ultimate "goal" of the game at its
present state, and why not strive for that?
Well, thanks to your "uber guild", that last �% is definitely missing in my
game now. I know : plenty of other dragons, plenty of this, plenty of that.
But if ST IS in fact oh, so trivial, then why did YOUR guild strive to go
there?! Surely, a zone THAT "common" in design and looks are not worth
spending so much time gathering keys for?

Let me reverse this : we all KNOW Sleeper can't be killed, then why wake him
at all?! Seems utterly foolish to me. So, basically, what I'm missing out on
is a chance to ever experience ST in its "virginial" state. A wide awake
Kerafyrm is NOT my cup of tea. I know he prolly won't be welcoming me right
there at the zone, but still...
And one last question for you : how would YOU feel if you hadn't been the
one awakening him? Like "Oh, that's cool. We'll just go kill some dragons.
They're all the same"?
