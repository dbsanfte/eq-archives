. But should anyone should be
> paid more than 60pp for clicking a button?

Its not just clicking a button.
I payed 60k for KEI. I spent lots of time levelling up my enchanter, and i
get asked a TON for KEI.
I have to stop, and spend my time finding, targetting the person, and
casting KEI, and medding the mana back.
 If i bufed every person who asked I would spend  90% of my EQ time medding.

60-100pp is an appropriate donation for KEI. This is what i pay clerics for
rezzes, and druids for POTC/POT9. It represents the time they took to aquire
the spell/levels, and the time they are taking to buff you .

Some of the potters on my server charge up to 2k/combine and its worth every
platinum.
Your not just paying for a button click. You are paying for the time it took
them to combine, the time it took them to become a grandmaster potter, and
your paying for the rareness of a grandmaster potter who can combine your
untrivial at 250 items. This is how it is with KEI as well.
