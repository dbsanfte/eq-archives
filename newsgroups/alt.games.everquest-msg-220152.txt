My point wasn't one or the other, it was indeed both; if bard
skill is sufficient then rogues have 100 pointless points, if
rogue skill is needed then bards are useless (the latter is the
situation with pick locks).  Its a catch 22 when skills either
work nearly always or fail always depending on your level, what
you need are weaker and stronger results based on skill, instead
of a required threshold.  Also, such a Huge disparity in cap
means that even the "well at 100 you have a decent chance but if
your skill was higher it would get even better" approach is
doomed to failure.

Compare this to Track, which caps a bit higher for druids than
for bards, and much higher for rangers (plus added utility) than
for either.  Yet bard track -is- still useful in many situations,
and in most of them a druid would be a bit better and a ranger
much better.

Tie the skill to your left and right turn arrows and forget about
it, thats all the pointless button mashing you'll ever need, and
Brell, you don't even have to keep sense heading there anymore
since they are about to give it to us for free (or face armed
insurrection if they give it ONLY to new characters)
