I have the Ti4600 128 Meg ram card. The game run very nice with this card.
bazaar is a little slow.. bu then again I don't think any video card would
make it run fast.....

I would have liked to bought the ATI Radeon 9700 Pro, but that's in the
$300-$400 range. If you get the nVidia Ti4600 you won't be let down.


Good Luck.
