After level 20 or so, most casting classes really start to lack in fighting
abilities. I'm not sure about druids, but I doubt you'll have the stats to
survive a few battles against blues by actually meleeing them. You might get
your fighting skills up by grouping and just swing a few blows when fm but
soloing is out of the question afaik.
Just make sure you spell levels stay maxed and you'll be fine.

I remember reading of a good one, but have the specifics somewhere stored at
home (I'm now at work). I don't think I myself would do it often to gain
more then 1 level or so. I prefer to go out hunting and grouping with
others. It's all about the fun :)
