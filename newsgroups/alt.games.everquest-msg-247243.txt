AFAIK the stun kick at 55+ is only for large races, and its a common
misconception. I never knew a kick that stunned as a smaller race.
Bash with shield was the option we had.

And as a gnome warrior.. if kick stunned a mob she never would have
ghetto bashed. 99% of the purpose of a ghetto bash is to stun the mob
whenever possible.. the only other use is as a damage weapon.. and in
that kick works well enough.
