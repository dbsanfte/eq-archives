Yes, and I have no idea how I managed to type that lol I did a /who and 
he was the only one in BB, and he was anon, so I asked him *if* he could 
bind and offered 15 plat.  And he turned me down.  Saw him running 
around later pretty damn un-twinked and thought "wtf? 15 plat doesn't go 
far anymore, or what?"

Ryou
