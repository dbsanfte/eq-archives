I hate to break it to ya, but to a large portion of people over the age of
30 and/or from the entire east coast/southeast of the U.S., he did indeed
just come across as a racist.  I would have let it slide, because it is my
personal belief that everyone has the right to hate whoever they damn well
feel like hating.  Regardless, that's how it came across to me.

Hardly.  John Lennon was making a direct analogy between oppressed classes. 
Bizbee was, at best and assuming no actual racism, comparing the plight of a
druid asked to port with the oppression of a race of people.  That's not the
same manner, that's obscene.   =P

See above.  I respect your right to hate.  Who you hate, even if it includes
me, doesn't bother me in the slightest.  But I don't respect trying to claim
a racist comment to be anything other than what it is.

I have a huge ego.  I rarely claim to be humble, and when I do I claim to be
the *most* humble.   =)
