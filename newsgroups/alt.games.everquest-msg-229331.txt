I've seen some  wonderful stories in this newgroup; stories of frustration,
and fun.  When the post expired, they faded to nothing...if they had been
blogged, they'd stay on the internet forever.  Or maybe not forever, but for
longer than newsgroups hold them.

As for not explaining blogging...perhaps the author figured if you didn't
know what it was, you probably didn't do it. :-).
