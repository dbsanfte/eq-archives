The trouble is... anyone who buys OoW/DoN can get to the 'new' 1-
groupable top content. But if you arent raid geared... well.. then its 
still ok... unless you also happen to be a tank.  :/

Any schmoe magician (sorry mages, nothing personal) can group nigh 
anywhere he wants to because by and large if he's remotely competent it 
really won't matter how many hitpoints he has or what his dps actually 
is, especially if he also discriminates against his own 'class' of 
tanks. Sure raid groups won't particular want him, but a pickup group 
has no issues filling slots out with any dps class, regarless of his 
gear-class/hp/whatever.

Ok... I'll agree with all that.

I'd be surprised to see a significant number of raiders missing any 
expansion. Even Ykesha, had enough toys for raiders (charm slot, bank 
space, maps) to suck them in, even if there wasn't really much (if any, 
depending on just where they were) content for them.

Fair enough. I think there's enough of them to warrant a little more 
developer time. I wouldn't be surprised if their is enough of them to 
rival the raiders in sheer numbers of accounts. But, yeah, they are 
fragmented, unscheduled and disorganized and scattered into off-peak 
time as well.

Timezone being equivalent to off-peak... sure... although I'd add the 
parents with young kids to that list. Hell... I know several of them 
that -were- raiders until the baby was born. :)

Your right. EQ has evolved.

While I conceded EQ has evolved, I don't think that it was necessarily a 
requirement to leave the 1-group game 'behind' to the extent that it has 
been. (The various bones they've thrown to the 1-group crowd 
notwithstanding... 1 groupers are struggling for lack of well thought 
out, interesting, and rewarding content... not simple 'lack of content', 
or because we 'needed' elixirs and dumb crap like that.

There's a ton of 1-groupable content... little of it is worth doing, and 
the little that is tends to be particularly monotonous. (ie ... the oft 
mentioned Creators)

Heh. I think to -some- there is an elitism thing going on. Not to all of 
course. :)

And that's the crux of it. I'm not sure if you really disagreed with me. 
The elitist shot aside... do you beleive the 'loot whores' are so 
critical to maintaining that critical mass that the raid game would 
completely disintegrate if raid progression was left to raiders that 
actually raided 'for the love of raid progession' itself?

If so... what if we had (near) equipment parity, and the servers were 
merged down to 1 with load balancing like EQ2's instancing of busy 
zones?? 

Then even if half your raider population consisted of loot whores and 
vanished on you you'd be able to build raid forces out of the combined 
current server population, securing your critical mass of like minded 
people better even than the current system allows.

Seems like one of those win-wins to me...
