The software on my first wireless keyboard and mouse wouldn't load (bad CD),
so I replaced it with the same thing (Microsoft Wireless Desktop).  Played
last night.  Fully installed, the mouse worked great the entire session.
Anyone else have one of these?  How often do you have to change batteries in
the keyboard and mouse?

Cheers,
Eric
