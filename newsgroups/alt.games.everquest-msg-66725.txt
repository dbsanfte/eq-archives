  I think the way castersrealm.com gets the majority of its spell data is by
pulling it from some file stored on your hard drive... this file sometimes
has incorrect information to throw off people who use software to read EQ
system files like that.

  The only difference I can see that would justify casting Tangling Weeds
over Snare is that it apparently casts a quarter of a second faster.  Not
really a big deal in my opinion.
