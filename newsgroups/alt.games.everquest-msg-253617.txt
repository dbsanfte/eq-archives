I meet and feel in love with my wife of 9 years in a chat room on aol
back when it was 2.95hr after your 10 "free" hours.
We flirted on line a few nights, I called her one night, as we talked
all night long. Before we hung up I asked to marry me, YES without
ever seeing her.

Three weeks later We meet in person Sept 16,1995, got married Sept 19
and I moved to Ca Sept 25.

You can fall in love with a pixel and the person.

I meet met my life mate and am glad.
Love is what love is.
