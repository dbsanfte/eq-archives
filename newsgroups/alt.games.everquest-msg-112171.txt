IIRC, at 51 it's 90%, and it scales up to about 106% at level 60.  This is 
a rather fuzzy recollection of the studies I read, and incidently can't 
find links for. :/

At one time, hastes stacking of items and spells were horribly broken, 
such that any haste item plus any haste spell took you to the cap.  That's 
why, at one time, people always used augment.  But that's been a good year 
and a half since that was true.
