I have to agree.  For example, my druid has his old skin spells on page 50,
starting with Wood, Rock, Steel, etc with the latest one up front.  When
that gets replaced then it will go to the back of the book with the others.
My first couple of pages consist of the spells I use the most.  My
ports/evacs are seperate my group and solo, with the most common ones
towards the front of the book.
