Loved it on test ... most likely love it live. Only thing is learning 
all the new spell gems. I'd take the 'it may make it faster' with a 
grain of salt though.

Well on Drinal, bazaar seems to be the new NFP trading zone. I've zoned 
in and unless I stay near the SH zoneline I can barely move (mouse or 
character). I sincerely HOPE they're aware of the lagfest and will fix 
it ... otherwise the bazaar will be unusable for me.

Nice. Anything to use less memory is a "good thing". I just hope they're 
not as dopey as the old ogre scratching his butt models.

Awww now that really hurts. :( I thought of them as "ghetto crits". 
Bummer....

How bout removing them entirely.. it was dumb at level 1 and is still 
dumb at 35.

Hmm a patented Verant "well that went over well lets wait a while and 
change it back" maneuver. I remember when I stopped playing my druid. 
Yep, it was right after the "we HATE kiting" nerf. Can I bring him out 
of retirement now? Nah, I've learned to group. 50+ druids will be 
happier.... "Heh, don't want me in your lousy group??? Screw it I'll go 
back to quadding".

Hmm why not put the spell back in the game? I'm sure the people that 
already have the spell are pleased.. but what about the ones who never 
got it?

Wohooo!! No longer going througha stack of malachite looking for an even

Someone listens to Furor I guess.

Hmm ... how long do the auctions on playerauctions.com usually last? 30 
days maybe??

Not that it's anything but a horrendous timesink now. We're rewarding 
our players by not making it all but impossible. Does that sound about 
right?

Wow.. shoulda been done two years ago though. A minor inconvenience but 
i've had several ML not rejoin after the leader goes.

All in all I'd say some nice things in this patch. Might be worth it to 
dust off my mage for a bit.
