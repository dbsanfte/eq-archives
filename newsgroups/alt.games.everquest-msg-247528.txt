    A valid point, but it certainly detracted from the game to me. The
'feel' went downhill rapidly.

    Well, I don't see that as a good reason for EQ to have done it. Nearly
every game of the 80's and 90's that could came out with a linear,
"missions" based plot - and that's the worst format for a game.

    Yeah, once given, why take it away?

    Although if I remember rightly, if you hit the plane of fire in Moebius,
your maps burned, or something, and it was cool. Dim memories.
