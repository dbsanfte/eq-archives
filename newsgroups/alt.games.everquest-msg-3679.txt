Aw, but we still love you :)

Anyway, this thread reminds me of the time I got flamed by a webTV
users for commenting -nicely- on her less-than-perfect site (think
crashing, no working links if read with a regular browser, having
directly copied images from my website and passing them off as hers
etc). She got her panties in a bunch and in her reply informed me that
her site worked great on her webTV, that my computer obviously sucked
and suggested that I upgrade (from unix? :) ) to a webTV so I could
view websites properly.
