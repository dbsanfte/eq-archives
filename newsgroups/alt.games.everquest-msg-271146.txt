Well Clydefrog, just like in RL people always want you to be how they 
want you to be. I wish I remember it now but Bob Dylan wrote a great 
line about that in one of his songs, knowing him he probably wrote about 
that in more than one of his songs. I ought to know as I have them all 
but I cannot remember.

I learned a long time ago that I will never be able to please everyone 
and I learned that trying is a complete waste of time. So I just do as I 
please and try to be a nice guy and if that ain't good enough well too 
bad. They'll get over it.
