The really sad part of lull pulling is that it went to classes that never
pulled without it.   As such, they have *much* less of an idea of thier
aggro range and mob assist range than my warrior does.

That statement should really read "- and when do you need to lull more than
2 or 3 mobs to do a pull anyways?"  I've yet to see an LDoN room that would
require more than two lulls to break (although I'll grant that there may be
some that need 3) ... Yet it seems somtimes that all the clerics, bards,
enchanters and such will sit around and cast lull on every mob, even the
ones *waaaay* back by the door to the next room before pulling.  7 or 8
lulls per room. Each with a chance of resist pulling the entire lot of them.
