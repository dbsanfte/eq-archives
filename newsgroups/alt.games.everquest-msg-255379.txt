There is no single group encounter possible that can match the
complexity and difficulty of a raid. Firstly, because a raid requires
more people to know what they're doing (the better raids anyways).
Secondly because of the aforementioned balance problems - making a
single group encounter anything more than a certain level causes major
class welcome problems - we saw this in GoD bigtime.

Not necessarily envious of *me* of course. But reading all the
complaints here, every time it seems the people are comparing
themselves to the raiders. They want the raiders' gear, they want to
kill ldons in 20 minutes like the raiders do, blah blah blah. Why do
they want this? Because they envy the raiders' power.

They don't have to worry about it now. No one is forced to raid. If
they want the best stuff they have to raid; if that is a problem,
Horizons is right down the corridor, three doors down. Or if you
prefer a game where the developer isn't bankrupt, Anarchy Online and
SWG are both soloers paradises, maybe CoH too.

But EQ is the way it is, and some of us like it this way and would
prefer it to NOT change. Too many changes have already gone in for
these so called casuals as it is and they've consistently ended up
dumbing the game down.

I fail to see the problem with any of the things you seem to want to
get rid of. And I like using my raid gear in normal grouping. So
thumbs down.

This simply isn't true for the bare fact you could *get* to the end of
advancement. Through velious it wasn't even particularly hard. But
when you can get to the max level, have a set of gear that made you
more or less equal to anyone else on the server, etc... advancement
was not "everything". Most the evil powergamers I associated with
actually wanted their *guild* to advance, not themselves except by
proxy, and at the high end this still holds true to some extent.

But now, advancement is such a long process and the mudflation has
extended it so far the casuals can see they'll never be able to hit
that end. And in sets the jealousy. Cue "I have a life, I resent the
no lifers who sit on their computer all day" whines here.....
