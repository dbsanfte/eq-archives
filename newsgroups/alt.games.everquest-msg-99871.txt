I've got a DE Wizard and he's not all that KOS (mainly Dwarves and Elves..)
Just don't choose Inny for a god. From what I can remember (as agnostic DE)
Im ok in FP, Qeynos, Erudin, Paineel, HH, Haven't tried Halas yet, but if
those fishing barbarians in No Ro are any indication I am ok there too
(actually buying and selling is a different story, but faction can be
fixed), and of course you have the overthere. I can't remember why I chose a
DE originally but I have to say having the natural hide ability is rather
nice when afk etc...not having to worry about dropping invis.
