I REALLY wish I liked the game and I'm sure it has it's good points but I
just can't get past interface, when I look at a button or a shortcut I want
to know immediately what it is, I want a lot of information but I don't want
the screen crowded,  when I'm walking around I want to see something other
than pitch black sky.....I couldn't even tell you if I was indoors or out
for god sakes!  No map?  No radar?  Camera that won't follow from behind
your avatar?  The only thing I could kill by myself were grubs?slugs?

If I'm way off base I'd be glad to hear about it, I didn't spend $30 just to
get a pretty box.(and it is pretty btw)....so much so that I expected a lot
more from the game.  The game reminds me of a MMORGP played with E&B
spacestation avatars.
