There is actually a fair bit of info on the game out there that is not on
the website, in particular the article recently put out in Computer Gaming
Monthly.  Had a lot of detail about features/etc for the game, although
nothing in regards to specs/schedule/beta.  A lot of "ooh ahh", and I have
to say that the tradeskilling system sounds...neat.  Not just
click-click-click... something much more exciting.  For example, if you
were making a sword...it would take a while for it to be made, and while
you were sitting there, a warning might flash such as "impurity in metal",
and you have a set amount of time to react to that and correct the
problem.  More complicated than that, but it gives you an idea.  Much more
interactive. If I had the danged magazine here at work I'd describe it,
but my verbal skills are limited this morning.  If anyone is really
interested, I can find it later today.

There's also the classic "multiple versions of an encounter" sort of
deal.  Two folks could be camping the same mob, but each in their own
"bubble".  A way to get around camp-bickering, I suppose.

Ohh, man, I'm coherant today.  If anyone is curious, I think the article
was summarized on safehouse, although I don't recall the tradeskill
explanation in that summary.
