All right, what characters do you play?? I want to remember it so that I 
never pass you an awaken or heal you by accident.

Don't go all the way down the slippery slope and be reasonable. I don't
know what version of CoH you are playing, but I have never had that
happen. When fighting in PP, I have had people from PCSAR fly by, give a
quick healing and then move on, but I have never had a high-level healer
sitting behind me and helping me.

So you are in favor of throwing out a system that allows for more
immersion in the spirit of superheroness because there are a people who
choose to misuse it. Gotcha.

He gets nothing in reward. However, it is very much irrelevant to the KS
discussion at hand. You (I believe it was you) brought up other MMORPGs
as a way of showing how KSing is handled in their game. Those game
systems make it impossible to do something like that. The fact that in
CoH, if you are fighting a tough battle, someone can come and give you a
helpful buff/debuff is something that is essential to the spirit of a
superhero game.
