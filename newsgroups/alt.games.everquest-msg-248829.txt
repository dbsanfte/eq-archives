I know. I have no idea why the United States can't compete with Europe's 90%
density for Broadband (some smaller countries can offer broadband to 98% of
the population) and Asia with their superspeed DSL lines and citywide
glassfibernetworks.

The U.S. is limping behind somewhere on the broadband front.... Probably the
only Western nation left that still has TV commercials for DIAL-UP Internet
:)
