Hail, All-

I am a level 13 human lady necro.  I like playing the chars other people
don't play.  I followed the thread about the other person with a baby necro
wanting to explore new areas with interest.  Personally, at 12, my necro
couldn't handle Najena or Befallen.  The spider's poison in Erud's crossing
gave me no end of problems.  She is untwinked in all respects, though she
has a decent amount of plat earned from helping out players she has met in
her travels.  Getting keys to Paineel definitely helped her financially.
She paid her dues in the Qeynos sewers to net her some int gear.  Lots of
time spent in Everfrost and Karana zone boosting tailoring skill.  Large
tailored bags sell ok, even with everyone being a twink.  I have had very
little luck selling raw silk or studded leather.  Hopefully the HQ skins I
am saving will make me money when I start making backpacks.  Currently
exploring Paineel and the Warrens.  I have also had some success in a group
in Kerra Isle.  Great exp, but little loot besides always-welcome food.
I am looking for more suggestions on where to send my wandering Necro next.
Preferably on quests that leads to necro-usable gear, INT items especially.
(Human necros take it in the shorts compared to Erudites in the brain
category.)
I am hoping to avoid the zones that resemble shopping malls the day after
Thanksgiving(US).
I am also looking for suggestions on obtaining a decent necro weapon.
Paineel quests give out Erud only gear, so that is out.  I had to make a
mule to get the Servant Staff from Erudin, which is a very ho-hum weapon at
best.  It doesn't even beat the cracked staff I have been lugging around
since level 4 or so, but at least it is a quest item.

So, any suggestions on my lady necro's immediate future?  All replies
welcome.
