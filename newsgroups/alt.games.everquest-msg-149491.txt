Did that, the newest one for my old asus board is 8/5/02 now, not bad
;)
I installed xp before and had no problem, then installed SuSE 8.0
linux and lilo, still no problem. Then I installed beta drivers of the
new nvidia driver, that hosed XP. I don't get why going back to the
previous save thing doesn't work right either, that was of no help.
So I deleted and actually reformatted the partition XP was on, then
had lots of trouble trying to install still.

I did the fdisk /mbr thing, did not seem to help. I even got xp
installed to the point where I could use recovery console without a
password (in xp home before full installation boot it prompts you for
a password though there is none, and won't run) Then I did the boot
sector and mbr rewrite commands there, still no help.

Yeah it overwrote it, but no help, then I even did the stuff above.
As I said having no trouble in 98 all this time so its something odd
about xp. At this point backing up stuff and low level
formatting/formatting seems like the best choice.

Yeah I know, in theory XP is better with protected memory space and
such.. but this does you no good when you have constant blue screens
and trouble with it.. if you manage to get it installed at all.
Meanwhile I have zero errors in 98, zero problems playing games, etc.
Its kind of a "if its not broken don't fix it.." thing I guess.

I think this time I'll just make several linux floppy boot discs
instead.. or use the bootable CD rom from this suse thing then
start the linux hard drive with it.
