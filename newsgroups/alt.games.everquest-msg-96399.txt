You can start on several parts of your Armor of
Ro quests now.  That should keep you busy until
about level 33.


>Decent levels/dungeons (apart form unrest) to get decent Xp/loot??

At 22 I hopped the boat to Kunark and hung out in the
northern end of the Overthere.  When that started to 
green out, I moved into the Dalnir "brute tunnels" and
spent time in Dalnir (when I could find a group) or
in the brute tunnels when I couldn't.  I don't think
that's the optimum place to be, but I had fun and stayed
there until level 30.


>PS I have Alloy Bastard Sword is this about right for my level??

I wish I had had a sword that nice at that level.

See the world.  If you've been around the Kaladim area for
22 levels, it's *really* time to start traveling.  I moved
over to Antonica (basing myself in Freeport) at level 16,
and I should have done it sooner.

The Armor of Ro quests will make you travel as well.
