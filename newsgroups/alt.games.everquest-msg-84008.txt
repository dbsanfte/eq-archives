More than one person told me that they noticed a definite improvement
upgrading to 768.  It'd be nothing like the improvement from 128 to 512
though. :)

And, of course, you have to make note of what OS you're using.  I keep
hearing different stories but I don't think I'd bother putting more than 512
in a Win98/Me machine.

Tell me about the expensive memory...my computer has Rambus (800MHz) in it.
Cheapest pricewatch price for name-brand memory (Simple) that I could find
all the info about was $255 for the 512MB kit (2 sticks). :p
