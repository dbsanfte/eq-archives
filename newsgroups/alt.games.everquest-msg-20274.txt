So you are assuming they won't learn about PvP?  That seems unwise.

You also seem to be forgetting about the lack of rules.  Unless you
are so much better than everyone else that you will never get killed,
and you plan to stay that way, that too could be unwise.  When some
evils do manage to kill you, and then camp your corpse or your bind
point, you might wish there were some goods or neutrals that you
hadn't pissed off.
