Besides other items that have been suggested in this thread, there are
some that make caster characters a lot more powerful:

FT items.  Unless you are very lucky, this will consist of a solstice
earring, odds of any other purchasable FT items with a budget of only
40Kpp are very low.  Flowing Thought is mana regen, it works standing
sitting running whatever, you regen 1 extra mana every tic, which doesn't
sound like much but its half again your mana regen for any situation
except sitting.  Solstice Earring will have pertty poor stats until you
level up quite a bit, but the FT will be worth it, and you'll gradually
get a better and better earring without any further investment.  Should be
able to do this for about 3010 PP (3000 for the various items you'll need,
plus 10pp for an invis potion so you can make it thru Echo Caverns to the
hand in in Fungusgrove

A Horse.  Irritating animals, but they give you movement speed like JBoots
and you get mana back like you are sitting when you are standing, casting,
clicking on various items for effects.  Can be a lot more mana regen added
than a Solstice Earring.

HP regen item.  Fungi Tunic is the classic, but out of your price range.
There's an Iksar something item that's regen too I think, and Zlandicars'
Heart for pure casters.  Sitting around waiting for HP to heal up means
down time.  Either of those might be in your range.


The reason I mention those three is that they reduce what is to me the
most annoying thing about EQ, the "down time" where you are sitting on
your butt waiting for enough mana or HP to go again.  They aren't
overpowering enough to make a huge difference in a fight, so they
shouldn't spoil you too much, but they should mean a lot less time wasted
between fights.  Of course if you like to kill a mob, then sit down and go
do the dishes before returning to kill again, this won't be so nice.

In addition to this, there's Focus items.  These tend to make you about
10% more efficient, which is the same as increasing your mana pool 10%
-and- your regen rate 10%; there are quite a variety of these, of varying
effectiveness, one nice one that doesn't affect your pool at all is the
extended range line.  Prices vary wildly, but getting a set of these is
the equivalent of getting your melee a weapon with a better damage:delay
ratio.  They don't tend to really change the game since the effect is
fairly small, but they are a bit harder core twinking than the three items
above.  Funny thing is, you can probably get a full set for under 500pp
for any starting character; you need only get the "focus effect I" items.
IF it turns out you like the character you'll eventually want to spring
for effect II items which work on spells over level 20, or even III items
which work on spells over (44?), but the first 20 levels wouldn't get any
more effect out of those higher level items than they will out of the
focus I items.

Of these items, only the HP regen one would work for bards, by the way,
which is a special class left out of these fun little balancing gimmicks.
Get him a really nice drum and don't worry much about anything else.
