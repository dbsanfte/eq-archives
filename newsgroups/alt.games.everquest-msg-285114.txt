You emphasise ERUDITE as though you think that matters?  If you were
to create an Erudite character today, you would have the option of
starting in either Erudin or Crescent Reach.  ALL races are allowed
to start in Crescent Reach.

Apparently, though, many EXISTING characters somehow got screwed up
and their starting cities were CHANGED to be Crescent Reach.  Which
is awkward if you really don't want to go there, and downright fatal
if you haven't downloaded the expansion.  If you /petition, though,
you can get a GM to change your home city back to where it was.

I'm of two minds about it myself.  I downloaded the files just to get
it over with, but I haven't actually bought the expansion yet.  My
halfling's starting city got changed to CR as described above.  So
now, if I Return Home (don't have Origin AA), I can go to CR, but if
I try to enter Blightfire from there or from PoK I get told I can't
because I haven't bought the expansion.  (I haven't tried camping in
CR to see if anything bad happens when I simply "enter world" there.)

The reason I'm of two minds is, well, I'd rather be able to Return
Home to Rivervale.  It's much less laggy, I know where everything is,
etc.  I haven't yet seen any reason I would want to go to Crescent
Reach.  But if I ask a GM to fix my home city, I'll no longer be able
to go to CR unless I give in and buy TSS, which so far I've seen no
reason to do.  And I just KNOW as soon as I change it, I'll find out
about something in CR that I want!
