I started in January 2000. Played an Ogre Warrior up to less than a bubble
under LV17 by that October. Got better and played a Halfling Druid up to
LV15 by early-mid March 2001. I bought Kunark and Velious together online,
and as luck would have it, that same weekend I started it was the weekend
that my department was nearly dropped, and any of us making more than almost
nothing were gone. I spent the next 7 weeks not only doing massive job
search (for a few hours a day), but playing EverQuest for 8-12 (and
sometimes 16) hours a day.  I learned how to play an Iksar, and a Shadow
Knight, leveled up to LV12 (then to 13, then to 12, 13, 12, 13, 12, 13,
12.....got too adventurous too early). I then researched and played a
Barbarian Warrior up to LV15. I started him and in 2 weeks (really only
played 10-12 of those days) I had 100+ hours on him.  I then got a job, and
have since (this was start of the 3rd week of May, about May 13) leveled him
to LV17 (within half a bubble of 18).
    Yeah, employment has its drawbacks.  At this job we don't have full
browsing abilities, unmonitored e-mail (and newsgroup) access.  So I read a
lot less newsgroups too (sit and do that during the day).  This company
claims they don't allow Internet access for security reasons (which
perfectly explains why a computer in the break room and in an area
completely out of sight of the cameras, was left open with full admin
privileges for Windows NT with access to the network drives ("My Computer"
window was left open showing this), anything anyone wanted to do,
unmonitored, and full abilities too).

LV17 Ogre-butt scratching Warrior (Cazik Thule)
LV15 Halfling-complained that alcohol tolerance skill is level capped for
some STUPID reason, Druid (NOT a k3wl d00d) (Solsik Ro)
LV12 Iksar cant find my pet because he got tired of me begging to him Shadow
Knight
LV17 (almost 18 and looking for bronze) Barbarian Warrior.
LV21 Human (we think, but DNA has never been tested for proof) Computer
Technician (who at one time was made drunk, for the first time, by 2 friends
at one point and although barely able to walk/talk/write/type, still knew
some basic HTML, number conversion to hex, alphabet from Z-A, and 2 digit
times 2 digit number multiplication, and therefore determined that something
is obviously NOT right here.)
