I just started one and its not "hard" just very different.Its a class that
needs to group to take full advantage of its ability.The fact that you cant
cast every buff you have on your self or others (the most at any time is
said to be 4 but I'm just getting used to twisting 2) forces you to choose
your "spells" or "songs" wisely.Give it a shot ,wont kill ya to experiment
on any class/race combo until you find the one you like best.
