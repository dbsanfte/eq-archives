Huh.  We must think alike.  My druid made 24 today, so I ported back
to Surefall to check in.  Nothing new there. :-)

I decided to practice wolf form, so I did a run over to BlackBurrow.
Discovered about zoning/poof goes the wolf form quickly.  While
running around in BB, I encountered a really nice newby, level 9
shadow knight.  He asked if I'd help him level to ten.  All I needed
to do was buff him a bit and heal him.

He said he wanted to go kill snakes.  Makes sense.  They don't aggro
too easily, and he can control the situation.  He gets bored after two
snakes, and decides to up on the bridge and start whacking on gnolls.
Well, next thing you know, he's got a full train going.  I cast SoW on
him, heal him up and tell him to get the heck out.

I probably need to explain better next time that getting buffed and
healed doesn't make you superman.   It was still fun helping him out,
though.

Bill
