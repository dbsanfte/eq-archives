*shrug* It's the truth. When you post stuff like you just did, it
gives the impression that you are talking out of your ass.

Perhaps you are confused with the difference between "the universe has
always existed" and "the universe has always existed as it is right
now". The problem is the post you replied to made no such distinction,
therefore the error is yours.

It may not make sense to people used to only thinking up to Newtonian
Physics but when it comes to early cosmology it is in fact possible to
have both a beginning and an "always existed" at the same time.

At which point you are no longer referring to any form of "time" at
all, and are actually indulging in the very sort of "assumption
without evidence" that plagues religion as well.

"There may be", "or something more exotic"... those are not phrases
that lend much support to a viewpoint. I hope you are not a scientist;
you definately come off as an amateur, not a professional. You
actually sound more like a lawyer.

It is useless, especially since you're using it to back a completely
incorrect statement.

Another incorrect statement. The one thing that, according to our
observations, that makes the universe universal is that there are no
"outside" forces or other physical laws acting on it. Whether or not
there are others becomes irrevelent if they can neither affect nor be
observed in any manner from ours.

I also can't help but conclude you're attempting to deflect attention
away from your original statement by bogging the post down in
theoretical (and questionable at that) cosmology.

You tell me. You're the one who posted: 

>Its the best place from which to stimulate thought.

Though for the most part all you've posted is the same claptrap
creationist babble one constantly sees on talk.origins or other like
places. Especially the baloney about creation being a "miracle". Not
exactly stimulating. In the end it's a semantic game to try to prop up
a belief system against the evidence provided.

And what is your basis for support of this? Who are you to declare the
work of thousands of physicists "very shaky"? The only one who's on
"very shaky ground" would be the person who has needed to do exactly
what David Navarro pointed out a few posts back - invent additional
variables into the equation rather than go for the simplest answer.

Could it be it is because you yourself lack the understanding they do?

A singularly poor suggestion. You argue that if the turtles are
invisible and undetectable the world could be sitting on an infinately
high stack of turtles... and then argue that this is as valid an
argument as any other regardless of evidence.
