After winning 2 adventures in a theme, go talk to the individual who
gives out adventurer's stones.

There used to be a database site - it moved.  I don't know the new 
address (been too busy for LDoN recently.  Got to get my kitty to 
58 so he can go with us, then live in Tak.  Both mage and BL desperately
want a DPoC)
