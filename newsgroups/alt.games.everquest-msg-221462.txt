1) LIE.  Say yeah, sure, whatever, then when split time comes give the
cleric about one fair split's worth, then disband her and do the normal
split (explaining that you've given her the 20% bonus, and you don't want to
give her yet another full split).  Or, simply do the normal /split and
ignore her complaints.

2) Say Yes, then run the adventure.  If *anyone* dies, disband her just
before /split.  When she bitches, explain that "you didn't hold up your end,
someone died.  We don't pay incompetent clerics.  You get diddly".  To make
this one more possible, tell her she gets 50% if she heals someone from
unconscious.  Don't tell her she gets squat if she mis-times it.

You should reimburse for 'dots, though, before doing the /split.
