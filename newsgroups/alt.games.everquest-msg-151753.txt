At 42, rarely port. Guess too many times I've been hunting and get a tell from
someone pestering me to "Buy a port to _______" I finish whatever I'm doing,
meet the person, group, fire the port off. Upon landing read, "_____ has been
removed from the group" They run off. I have never ever done any advertising to
port and never will. Although when I'm  bored, i watch the ooc's and someone on
a cr is asking for a port, I take them, buff and offer food and drink. Just to
meet nice folks. Too easy to get bitter in Norrath. It can happen if you let
it. Regards all. =)
