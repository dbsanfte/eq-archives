However you aren't sorry, don't care that your spam isn't welcome here, 
and I bet you even plan to include it again in this very reply.(see 
below) You go girl!

Your ability to grasp a metaphor is only slightly less than your ability 
to grasp the degree to which your post was welcome in the first place.

Its sore enough to most, violates the EQ EULA, as well as the anti-spam 
stance that has been established by convention here. In the likelihood 
that you still hadn't grasped it yet the stance is "No spam here." Its 
pretty standard really.

That what all the penis elargers and get rich quick schemers say too. 
And yes, you've been lumped into the same category as they are.

Congratulations: "It takes a special kind of jerk..."

>  Those that are not interested are not forced to view this post.

Where are you going with this? Should I be thankful to you that you have 
deigned to allow me not to view everything that comes out of your 
screwed up little brain? Do you normally force people to view the 
various things you excrete?

(*) Oh yeah... there it is... or there it would have been, at least.
