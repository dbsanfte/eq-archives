Yea, that is overstating the case. BSTs are a _good_ DPS class, but not
among the very best. (Of course I'm speaking in general here -- YMMV
depending on weapons, etc.). BSTs aren't the very elite at anything, our
value is being usefully good at lots of things all at once, moreso than any
other single class.
