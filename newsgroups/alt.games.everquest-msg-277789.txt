Ostensibly, the reasons some items are marked lore include:
-It is a unique item in the storyline; you could logically only loot
one of these items.
-It is something that was carried by a unique character (mob) and thus
two could not exist.

The real reasons are that they only want you to have one of them are
varied.  Perhaps having two would be unbalancing.  Perhaps having two
would let you exploit.  Perhaps they don't want people hoarding the
items.  Perhaps they just wanted to make sure that you knew you would
only need one drop to complete the quest.  Perhaps they screwed up.
Perhaps they wanted to insert more time sinks.

And you can't put lore items in your shared bank?  You can't put
no-rent and no-drop stuff in there, but since when is lore excluded?
