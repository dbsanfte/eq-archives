The name "Kitty cat" has been used frequently to describe full grown
: cats. Look up "kitty" in any dictionary and show me where it is
: defined as an adjective. No matter how you take it, Merriam-Webster
: doesn't agree with you, and that's what counts.

tool" to define words
or parts of speech so we have to show him some other way.....

Makes sense to me (??).
