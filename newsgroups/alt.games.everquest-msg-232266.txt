Do you do a lot of LDoN's?  I bet I have destroyed *five* augments as I've
upgraded gear.  Now for my lower level characters I don't even USE the
augments, I put them in the bank because my low level gear is crap and I don't
want to *waste* good augments at level 25 or 30.

You can't do 1000s of level 20 adventures because you would then be level 56.
So lets say I've done a hundred, I've earned enough for Uber Earring but it
says "recommended 65".  Not Fair.
Theoretically you *could* park your level 5 at the uber spawn site and then
bring him on and get Uber Gear from non-LDON places.  *That* would be wrong,
the level 5 didn't earn the gear, but he could certainly get it.
I've *earned* the points to buy Uber Earring MYSELF.  It's all no drop and
there's no way to *cheat* the system.
