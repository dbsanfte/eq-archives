Best event I ever heard of was in Nektolus where various high level items
(at the time) were given as reward for pieces of general crap found in the
surrounding areas, no raids were needed, no 55+ characters required. The
final reward was a PSC in return for a full suit of cloth armour. The zone
was full, as usual and no one attacked the Quest giver but then it was a PC
quitting for DAoC and not a GM :ï¿½)
