I'm curious.  Considering how important faction is in EQ, why didn't the
faction reporting bug merit an emergency patch?  I can understand that
they didn't want to bring the servers down so soon after a spate of
problems...but waiting nearly two weeks to deal with the problem seems
way out of line.
