In a group, make sure there is a designated leader. They are the one who
call run. Once you hear him/her say "RUN", you are well within your rights
to leave by whatever means possible.
Problems generally occur when no one is sure who is leading, so people
shout when they dont need to, and stay when they should run.  :)
