I don't think a bard would be a good character for any beginner,
especially with Veeshan as deity. (I don't know if that'd influence
faction in different cities). Tell her about the dragon worshippers,
by all means, but don't let her start playing as one before she's
gotten the hang of the game and stuff like grouping. Bards are not an
easy class to play either intellectually or manually, and with their
usual group dependency it'd help if she knew more before trying.
