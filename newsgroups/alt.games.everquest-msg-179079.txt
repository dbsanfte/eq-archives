    Now, I don't know what the economy is like on Karana so if some of my
suggestions are too expensive, my apologies. I'm used to having higher
spending limits. ;-) To me, it looks like you could use HPs, mana, CHA, and
resists, with resists being lowest on the totem pole right now.

    First, I'll suggest some "day raids", places you could go to upgrade
stuff. Then I'll make a few sugestions about specific upgrades.

    Day Raid 1: Sol B. The Efreeti area would be all blue to your group, is
more than doable at that level, and you could get Golden Efreeti Boots to
upgrade your feet (melees could get the Djarn's Ring). That would be a big
boost, and since the boots are the common drop you should get a pair. IF
they were up, you could also try a raid on the fire giant castle. It would
be good experience with unmezzable mobs, and should prove to be a solid
challenge. You could come out of that with a Tranix crown (AC 13 CHA 15 MR
20) or a Rokyl's Channeling Crystal (secondary, AC 10 HP/MANA 50 Extended
Enhancement III). The crystal is a very nice item for a buff class like
yours, and would last you a very long time. Rokyl's other drop is an INT 7
mask with Improved Damage II (works on Discordant Mind), so either way you
could come out ahead.

    Day Raid 2: The Hole. The Hole has absolutely fabulous XP, and drops
Loam armour in addition to other items. Loam is INT/CHA gear - right up your
alley.

    Day Raid 3: Velketor's Lab, the "upper spiders" camp: this camp would be
solid blue to you and your group, and there's a number of named mobs that
pop in it. Your melee friends will love coming here as a number of neat toys
drop for them, like haste gloves and good weapons. You can come away with a
AC 8 WIS/INT 3 HP/MANA 35 mask or a Ring of the Frost Spider, INT/WIS 2
HP/MANA 25 PR 10. Even if you decide against going here, the ring should be
within your price range and would make a nice replacement for the Ring of
the Goblin Lords or the GM event ring. There's also some random rare drops
on spiders in the area, like Spider Fur-Lined Boots (AC 6 CHA 5 HP 45) and
Spider Fur Gloves (AC ? INT 3 MANA 35 CR 2) which would look very nice on
you.

    Guild raid: Hate. There's still items in Hate worth getting for folks of
your level. In particular, Insidious armour from hate has excellent stats
for you. Go to Allakhazam's and look up the hat - how would you like one of
those? =)

    Three more items I'd like to recommend, based on what I saw as your weak
points (head, ear, finger, hands, feet). The Platinum Tiara is usually
priced low in The Bazaar, and the HP 35 MANA 50 beats out your current hat
by a country mile. I didn't suggest camping it because I'm not sure about
the XP in that part of Lower Guk for characters of your level. For your ear
slot, you can usually pick up an Inlaid Jade Hoop (AC 2 CHA 3 HP/MANA 35
right-click High Elf Illusion) for a few hundred pp because of how common
they are. This would be much better for you than your Batskull Earring.
Finally, a quest for another ring to replace the Goblin Lord ring:

    http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2193

    All the items are easy to collect, and many are found on vendors near
the area where they drop. The stats are nice (HP 30 MANA 20), and Mana
Preservation II should still work on spells you cast on a regular basis (up
to level 44 spells). 10% off Tashania, Shiftless Deeds, Arch Shielding,
Brilliance/Enlightenment, your AoE Stuns except Color Slant, and Discordant
Mind sounds good, no? =)

    So good luck on your quest for better stuff. There's a lot of
suggestions there, so you should be very busy for some time to come!

    James
