More likely...
Has a life and cannot devote 3-6 hours a day to leveling.  Maybe plays 3-5
hours a week like I do.

I still haven't figured out why people care.  It's a game function.  Privacy
is not being invaded (it's not like stopping you on the street and checking
underwear tags).  I turned off the message because I just don't care.  Look
all you want.  I have nothing to hide.  It seems that most of the people
that do object are players with twinks and are embarrassed by it.
