Wow, everybody here was so helpful with my request for weapons options for
my Shaman, that I thought I would ask your help again (I did some of the
quests suggested BTW - Thanks - I am now outfitted with new shiny weapons)

My adventuring partner, a 7th lvl warrior, is travelling with me and is
proficient with 2h and 1h slashing weapons.

What a feasable weapons for her to use, she has a rusty 2h sword at the
moment... Quest suggestions would be good, I really enjoy the quests.

(We are killing skeletons and bears en-masse, hoping to gather HQ Pelts and
piles of bone, but dare I say it, this is kind of boring)

Advice welcome.

Later
 Stephen
