Speaking as such a cleric (lvl 57, never guilded) I for one have done
the quest up to Ragefire and have accepted the fact that this is where
my epic ends.  There is no chance in hell of me being able to gather my
forces in time to compete with guilds over the spawn, so no point in
camping it or expecting to ever complete the quest.  Pity, useful item
and all, but that is what happens when you refuse to subject yourself to
the horrors of being in an uber guild.  Of course I retain my free will
which is something no man or dwarf should ever be without.  So I med
after I rez, but at least I get to pick who I play with instead of
putting up with leet assholes in order to gather phat lewt.

Hmmm, guess I don't have to worry about declining guild invites after
that outburst <G>.
