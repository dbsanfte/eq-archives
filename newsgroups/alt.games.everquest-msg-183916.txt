    Yeah Ben when I think about it, we've been having completely two
different arguments here and it's my fault. I should have gone and looked up
the spells you were talking about (yes DT you were right :P) and made sure I
had the right level range in mind. I apologise for dragging you into this
senseless argument and to anyone who actually forced themself to read it.

    My actual position is that KEI is utterly innapropriate for use in 20's
and probably 30's. If the level cap which I understand is supposed to be 46
was effectively enforced I think the effect on the game would be positive.

    Although in the situation where two haste spells are in contention, and
one is far more expensive and slightly more powerful, if the numbers support
it I advocate doing whatever is necessary manawise to be casting that spell,
BUT if those measures require a 20's or even 30's enchanter to go and get C3
I find my own position unsupportable. Mathematically it's still correct but
C3 at that level is almost an exploit, to my view.

    With regards to you not having kei and this having a detrimental effect
on your group, I regret being so aggressive in my phrasing - I actually
thought you were advocating using augmentation on 40's melees. If you can
try and see things from that angle my foaming at the mouth attitude makes a
little less nonsense <g>

    How I should phrase my position on this issue is this: If you are a
competant or gifted enchanter you can without doubt perform admirably and
even exceptionally without KEI. Indeed the difference between having KEI and
not having KEI drops a lot for enchanters as they level up because they have
C1 and C2 - of course. BUT... on top of everything else you do, the extra
mana KEI gives you obviously lets you do more for a group. Be it extra
nuking or allowing you to pull an even more insane maneuver with charming or
group mezzing AE stunning or what have you. And by comparison, and only by
comparison to this, not having KEI is a disadvantage to your group. I should
not have, and did not mean to imply that your presence in the group had a
net negative effect for not having KEI. That's a ludicrous position and if I
appear to have taken it, I regret it.

    As a further explanation of why C3 is so important to *my* grouping,
please understand that in a chain pulling group or if I am puller of any
group, I get zero medding time. C3 ups my mana regen (which in an hour or
two of near unbroken pulling is the only mana I have, my hybrid manapool
gets gobbled up very quickly) from practically zero to almost the level I
would attain constantly medding. If I'm grouped with an enchanter (Which is
only about 40% of the time) this effect is proportionately less. Without any
mana regen my casting, over time, becomes restricted to one or two spells
each pull. Usually one 5-mana strength tap to initially gain agro and one
taunt spell to hold it to protect casters and DPS melees. With even low
level clarity that extends to an AC tap which helps the group a decent
amount if I'm tanking (very often am) and the occasional nuke, snare or
debuff. C3 extends my casting into constant nuking, dotting, debuffing,
snaring and as much agro as anyone in the group needs to do as they please
with the mob. With c3 a wizard grouping with me need only wait for me to
land 3 spells on a mob before slamming it with an ice comet, that's a huge
boost and lets that godlike artillery piece shorten otherwise regular
battles to a point of triviality. These are the reasons I like c3 for
grouping. Not only does it vastly increase my value to the group but it
allows me to apply a larger number of tactics and simply do more and
different things, which makes the long grind more interesting than simply
hitting the attack button on or off. If you can picture an enchanter with 85
int who isn't allowed to med 95% of the time and when he can med has his
skill capped at 180, that's a bit closer to my viewpoint <g>

    I can solo any single mob I've ever soloed just as effectively with c3
or without. Takes a bubble or two of my mana, depending on the mob. But as a
fear kiter (sk's have terrible self healing abilities) I do most of my
damage standing up and chasing a mob, swinging. That means that without a
mana regen spell of any kind, I must med a significant period of time to
compensate for every point I spend during a fight. Having c3 simply means I
can reduce that medding time to zero or almost zero. I don't think having c3
reduces the tactics and coordination required for me to solo. I probably
devote more time to balancing mana output vs mana input because the two CAN
be brought into balance. C3 simply reduces the amount of time I sit on my
evil hate-worshipping ass and watch mobs wander around.

    I hope thats cleared things up a bit - those *are* my experiences and
perhaps you can see that they are simply different to yours for a good
reason, and not necessarily inferior. And once again I apologise for
dragging you into this completely pointless debate. I think I've gotten
overused to meeting people with my fangs in here instead of my braincells. I
hope you and others who might have read this thread do not write me off as a
complete idiot because of that mistake.

James
