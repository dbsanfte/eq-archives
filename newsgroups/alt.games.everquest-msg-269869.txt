Does anyone analyzing this kind of thing take into account things like
downtime?  For example, suppose you had 1000 HP and 0 AC, fighting a mob
that does ~1000 points of damage to you in the time you can kill it, and you
want to be able to take two of these back to back.  Suppose you could raise
HP to 2000 HP, or raise AC high enough to reduce the damage you take to 500.
Both would let you on average take two of the mobs back to back.

However, the "raise HP" approach would leave you with more downtime, as you
have 2000 HP to get back, or would require more mana from the healers.  The
"raise AC" approach would leave you only needing to regen or be healed for
1000 HP.

On the other hand, the 2000 HP would be a lot nicer when you run into a
caster mob whose attack doesn't give a damn about your AC, and dying
certainly adds a lot of downtime. :-)

Anyway, I suspect to really figure out which is more important requires log
parsing over a variety of encounters over a long time.
