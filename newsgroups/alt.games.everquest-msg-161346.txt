Bard needs Red Dragon Scales off Nagafen/Talendor/Ragefire AND White Dragon
Scales off Vox/Gorenaire, And they need the spine off Phinny, and the
various guts (Kill Eldrig the Old to get the Chromodrac Guts. Kill
Nezekezena to get the Red Wurm Guts. Kill Blackwing to get the Hudge Oynx
Drake Guts. ) And you need an Amy tendril from Fear.  Then you can kill a
slightly wussified version of Trakanon.

For SK, the hardest part might be Lhranc, but most of the rest can be done
with 1 group. 2-3 groups for getting Soul Leech, 1 group can do the Blade of
Abrogation. 1 group that doesn't suck can do the Decrepit hide. 1 or 2
groups can do the Hole part.  And other than the 1000pp cough medicine,
there's no money sinks like bards have with possibly having to buy their red
or white scales.

Bard Epic is harder as a whole than the SK epic.  Possibly it seems easier
to you because it's actually useful, and guilds will go out of their way to
get their bards epics, whereas getting an SK epic isn't that big of a deal,
and comparable or better weapons are fairly easy to get anyways now, not so
for bards, their epic is IRREPLACEABLE because of the song modifiers.
