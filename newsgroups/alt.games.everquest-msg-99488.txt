The problem I've had with ZoneAlarm and EQ is that EQ gets patched so
often, prompting ZA to ask you to verify the new version each time - I
used to be able to get this verification stuff to pop up where I could
actually see it and click Yes, but not any longer.

No doubt some component in my system has drifted. Windows is like
that.

But, if you can get it past the point of asking if EQ is allowed to
access the network, my experience was that EQ ran behind ZA with no
problem.

Personally, when playing EQ, I want as much of the CPU to be dedicated
to the game as possible, so I shut off ZA regardless (since I also
have a hardware firewall in place).
