Thank you Dan.  I knew if I looked long enough for this someone would
answer it.  

My mom just got her first computer (she is terrified of it) and it
came with XP Home.  My Sis works for a company with many fringes tied
to Microsoft and she uses XP Pro on her Laptop and Desktop and is
going to upgrade Mom to Pro for the Remote Desktop if nothing else so
she can help her if she has a problem.

She said she would get me a version of Home or Pro for nothing if I
wanted it but I wanted to check if there were any known issues with it
relating to my system.  Currently Running the following:

MSI MS6167 v1 Motherboard
AMD Athlon (Classic) 550 (will upgrade to 1gig Tbird when $ is there)
320megs PC100 SDRAM (as soon as that stupid 256 gets here!)
VisionTek Xtasy 5564 GeForce 2 MX400 64meg Video Card
AWE64 Soundblaster

Any problems forseen?  Or any issues I should be aware of relating to
EQ and XP?  Or XP and any of the equipment above?

Thanks all!
