I used to get heaps of these from the grimlings of grimling forest, but they
now drop nothing, and I have had nasty experiences with acrylia caverns.
Whilst acrylia does drop from sambata tribesmen, often it is in the form of
blocks rather than bricks, and (probably because they have so many hits?) i
get far fewer bricks per hour than i use to. I am also sick to death of the
constant trains of people in DSP who run about sowed towing mushrooms and
worse.

Got hit by two trains at once a few days ago and went through all my mana
but just barely survived to zone.

 I'm trying to raise tailoring and need stacks and stacks of the acrylia
boning. Is there anywhere outside acrylia caverns where a 55 druid could
farm these?
