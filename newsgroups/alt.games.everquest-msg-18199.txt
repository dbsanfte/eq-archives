How to simulate what it is like to become a master at any tradeskill in
EQ. Let's use real money so it hurts more. Get $1000 out of the bank.
Make sure it's all in ones. Put a stack of ones on the back of the
toilet. Peel one off the stack and toss in the toilet bowl. Now
carefully flush the toilet. Repeat, until you run out of money.
Occassionally, the toilet may back up and give you some of your money
back. This means you had a paying customer for that portion of the
proceeds. Once that money dries off, flush it down again, one dollar at
a time.

While you can make money on tradeskills by selling the occassional
piece, not every piece is going to be sold to another player. And even
if you never poof, you cannot sell finished products to a merchant for
enough to cover the costs, except perhaps for baking and fishing.
