Lvl 23 Ranger here. I noticed that you don't have FlameLick memmed..

I FL every MOB I fight. The AC reduction is probably worth the mana, and you
get a few DOT points as well.

Is FL a spell that you've never used? Did you just recently quit using it ?

I'm just curious, as I'm always trying to figure out a way to be more
effective & mana efficient.
Just realized last night that I could Panic Crocs, and beat on 'em while
they try to flee.... DOH!

My memmed spells look like:

1) Flame Lick
2) Snare
3) Ignite
4) Root/Invoke Lightning
5) Camo/Thistle Skin/Endure Fire/Panic Animal
6) Skin Like Rock/Feet Like Cat
7) Firefist
8) Light Healing

(5,& 6 are whatever buff is needed. I also tend to cast FLC, and SLR on
others quite frequenly as well. )

I've been practicing my Conjuration some, but probalby not enough...
