Can someone please educate me on how to block any post from End Times
Prophet?  I am so incredibly tired of having to scroll thru half a dozen
posts that are completely fookin unrelated to EQ.  I cannot take anymore of
the Jack Handy meets Senile Grandpa posts.

I am using Microsoft Outlook Express Version 6.

Thanks in advance for the help.
