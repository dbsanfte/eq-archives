	Well, bearing in mind that I'm not uber :-) ...

	In a group a druid is support.  While you *can* fill a starring
role - main healer or main nuker - it can be a stretch.  But given a slot
where you can heal the casters when they draw aggro, chain nuke the 
CH'ing mob, DOT the ones that take 90 seconds to kill, root park adds, 
and so on, you can add an awful lot.  (Speaking as an under 58 druid
I dont think my best role is main healer or main nuker...)  

	Think of a druid as soy sauce.  Would you make a main dish out of
soy sauce?  Of course not.  But it's very handy to make things taste better.
