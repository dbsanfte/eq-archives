All the actual game info is held on the server side.  If you format you will
lose your logs, friends/ignore list, hotkeys and options setup.  The only
big deal is log files and hotkeys, b/c remaking hotkeys is a bit of a pain.
Dunno what files you need to backup for this stuff, but if you are just
concerned about the "health" of your character you'll be fine.
