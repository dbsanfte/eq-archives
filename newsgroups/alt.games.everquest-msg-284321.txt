Heh, whereas based on one of your previous posts my SK decided to
get a bow to have as an alternative pulling tool, especially when
soloing.  But I agree that (some) spells seem to be more effective
if all I want is aggro.

But I'm wondering about using Terror vs Darkness.  Of course, I'm
not on a Progression server, so my SK can usually find KEI, which
means mana isn't as much of an issue.  And my regular group is just
me, a bard, and a cleric (walking into a bar?), so my contribute to
total damage matters more.  Our usual mode is the bard pulling, me
using Dooming Darkness to take aggro, then Blood of Pain as a pure
damage DOT.  Plus of course taunt etc.  (In addition to mashing it
often on its own, I also have Taunt as part of my hotkey for sending
in the pet.)

Anyway, I've occasionally looked at the Terror line, but Lucy's
data is awkward so I can't see the actual effect (they all say
"increase hate by 1"), and the DOT seems to work fine and has extra
benefits, and with KEI I don't mind that it's 3 times the mana of
the comparable-level Terror.  But I guess I'm wondering if it might
be worth using Terror to cover the cases where the bard has been
mezzing/charming for CC and the DOT sometimes isn't enough to take
aggro right away.

Part of my problem is finding room in my spell gems, of course.
What do you normally keep loaded?  Me, I have the Spear line, a
lifetap, three debuff-taps (str, ac, and atk), FD, a regular DOT,
and the snare DOT.  Again, because mana isn't usually a problem,
and the debuffs are fairly short-lived, I like to keep them loaded
for frequent refreshes.  I occasionally swap out a spell for things
like Scream of Death (buff that adds lifetap proc), and I keep
eyeing Harmshield, but there are a lot of spells I just can't see
making room for.  (The aggro multiplier buff with a 9-minute
refresh timer, for one.)  My guess is you don't use the debuffs
as often so you cycle them in as needed?
