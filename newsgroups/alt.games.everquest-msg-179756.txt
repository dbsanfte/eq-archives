What's so bad about SOE making money anyway? You guys are all paying 
them, why don't you just stop if you're not happy then? It's not like 
you are forced to pay them.. and please don't bring me the "addicted to 
EQ" lame excuse, that would just show how weak you are in your mind.
Anyway, most of the people complaining would do the same if they 
could... if not all.
