What I've done is looked at all my girls with Luclin graphics, fixed
their eyes and hair, found out how plate/chain/leather/robes look on
them, and taken measures to only dress them in stuff that looks
acceptable in both old and new graphics. Luclin made my wood elf druid
give her gatorscale leggings to my high elf cleric, and made my dark
elf shadow knight replace her rygorr sleeves with darkforge sleeves to
match her darkforge BP.

Change your eyes and hair all you want and your old face stays the
same. If you change the face, your old face changes. What you need to
do is find the new face that corresponds to your old face and change
back to that.

As for the thing I hate the most about EQ: The stupid people that
cross my way on occasion.
