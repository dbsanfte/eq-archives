To add...

If you ask a stranger to do it be aware that Wolf Form goes when you zone so
it must be cast on you while in Sth Qeynos (you need to be grouped to
receive the spell but remember to disband on the hand ins or you will get
know Exp while grouped with a 39+ druid) also be aware that some hand ins,
like the Bandit Sash one, will treat your faction raises as totally seperate
while in Wolf Form, for example my Iksar is now "Warmly" to Paladins in Wolf
Form but still "Scowls" as an Iksar. The gnoll fang hand in isn't affected
by this, from memory.

Incidently, I have also managed to hand in fangs while invis'd. This is
possibly a bug as a NPC's should not respond to you while invis or invis
should drop when you attempt a trade with an NPC.
