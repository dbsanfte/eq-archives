You're right, it wouldn't work. If you share one IP address you'd need
something to do NAT (network address translation) to route stuff to the
right PC (either a hardware router or a software package like ICS,
Wingate, Sygate, etc). You would end up with one external IP address and
a different local IP address for each machine on your LAN (but the
outside world justs sees your network as one IP). If you do NAT with
something like Windows ICS (internet connection sharing), you'd need to
plug the cable modem into whichever PC is acting as your ICS server, so
you'd need an additional network card in this PC to connect it out to
the hub too. The ICS server PC would thus have 2 IP addresses, one for
each card.

Alternatively, just buy a cable modem router with a built in hub, like a
Linksys router or something - pretty much plug and play then, you just
plug all your PCs and your cable modem into it.
