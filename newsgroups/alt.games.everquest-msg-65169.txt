: Just no attack animation. The pets themselves are fine, but they have no 
: attack motion. It's kind of annoying, but they are attacking.

Had the same with an SK. I do not own SoL, yet. I assumed downloading
all the new complete animation frames woul dhave been too big, so
they settled for just the Graphics of it walking and standing.
According to the SK (who owns SoL), the pet was attacking and
also showing that in animation.
