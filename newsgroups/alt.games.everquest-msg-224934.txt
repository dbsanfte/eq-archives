I'm no graphic designer either, but I know lots of them, and I've been 
on related arts for going on fifteen years now, so I'll risk a bit of 
friendly advice. :)

If you ever decide to re-design it, pay attention to the outline of the 
logo; ideally, it should be recognizable even if it's just a filled 
shape. Maybe just tilting the box more to the left or right so that you 
can see some teeth silhouetted would be enough. This would also help 
break the inherent symmetry of the design (although the pose is fairly 
dynamic already).

Apologies if you weren't actually requesting comments. :)
