Either you are misunderstanding them, or they are smoking something.

Back a few years ago when Plane of Fear was added, Cazic Thule the god was
put in.  His special ability was death touch, he shouts your name and does
20,000 damage to you.   Reuses it every 30ish seconds.

A while back Fear was revamped.   Cazic Thule was upgraded to more godly
stats... 20 times more hit points, hits for 3 times as much, snares and
knockbacks... but he no longer Death Touches.

Three new mobs were added to fear.  Golems named Fright, Dread and Terror.
Fright and Dread are like the old "un-upgraded" Cazic Thule.  They dont'
have much life or hit very hard, but they do death touch.

Most likely the monks were talking about getting death touched by Fright and
Dread.     The other option is that a "LOT" of the monks at Monkly business
are braindead idiots.   (which, given the current state of the monk class,
and the chat that goes on in serverwide.monklybusiness... isn't that hard to
believe)
