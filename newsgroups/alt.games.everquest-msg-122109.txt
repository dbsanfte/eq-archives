Dan reported this recently indicating his friend had their high level
character replaced with a low level.

It MAY be a duplication. It may be that two characters are now logging
the same one. It may be that you've been swapped.

As you cant know I would suggest you please please please harass the GM's
and do NOT strip or get this character killed. If its anything other than
a dupe its possible its the only record the GM's have left of a character
someones worked very hard to build - if you strip it and get it killed
they may only get it back in the state you return it... its possible if
you dont petition the GM's wont even find it, depending on how their
data is stored at the VI place... somethings obviously gone horribly
wrong somewhere.

Y'know... you just dont know what the person who raised that character up
has right now. If you really absolutely must play go destroy crushbone
or something for the feeling of power, or farm greens for items for your
characters but dont strip its current possessions and dont get it killed.

Keep petitioning so the GM's cant ban you for "stealing" it (if they dont
know what went wrong and cant find hard evidence it was their fault they
have a tendency to assume its the players), and actually if you keep it
logged in you may find yourself getting a tell from a friend of the real
owner, from which you could work out if they still have access, and if
what you do affects them.
