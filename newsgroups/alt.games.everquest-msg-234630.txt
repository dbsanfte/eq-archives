From what I recall reading *somewhere* is that a mitigating mob can only be
slowed to a certain %.

Example, fighting a mob which mitigates, you cast your best slow (75%), you
get the partially / mostly successful message. The mob is slowed to a
certain %.  Cast your 50% slow on the same mob, and get only the normal
'yawns' message.  That mob can only be slowed 50%.

One of the reasons why some shaman think beastlords are overpowered, in some
zones. If what is above is true, they may have a point, as shaman should be
the best slowers (personally I think shaman should be less affected by the
mitigation than the 'lesser' slowing class's).
