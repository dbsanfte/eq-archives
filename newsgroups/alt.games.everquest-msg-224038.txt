One of the biggest disappointments for me in PoP was a lack of a MS4 pet
that would be to the 65 earth what MS2 is to 49 earth.

What a moron - but really no loss.  Any mid to low 50's character with
a couple of grey cells should realize that he's essentially being PL'd
when that happens.

FM, handing out rods and a fully buffed/equipped pet before the rez effects
wear off - welcome to the world of pet-canni.  I just got elemental pact
today, so from now on I don't have to carry around a full backpack of 
malachite to feed my habit :)

I lost the bid on a range item with summoning haste IV on it Tuesday night,
that would have allowed me to trade my fetid flesh belt in on a dusty 
girdle :/

BTW - fyi, reanimation haste III works on mage pets too - with it my 49 
earth is a 7 second cast.

We have a druid who cash camps that spot with a DC rat - very nice money.
