I solo most of the time. Mostly because I can only play for an hour or less
at a time, and a lot of people don't want to bother grouping if you can't
stay the duration. That's ok, I like solo.

For many levels I've hung around the Karanas. They suit my purpose, ie.,
there are lots of solo mobs, straggler Aviaks of all levels, The Hermit,
Bandits, etc. I need to hunt where I can move and not get agroed by a whole
village, so most dungeons are tough for me. Many of my spells won't cast
there anyway.

Now at 30, I can port a lot of places. I'm bored with the Karanas, and I'm
looking for new scenery, foes, exp, and loot.

I have all the expansions through Luclin. Where do I go, and what do I kill
when I get there?
