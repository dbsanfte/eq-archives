I think you've basically got 2 ways of doing it, but both involve the
shaman staying in melee range. First would be to bring up an earth pet
and use root to determine agro. Shaman stands at about half of maximum
melee range, the rogue slides in to tank while backstab is cycling
then slides out to max range to backstab. Only works while the mob is
rooted but I've used it to pretty good effect in a rogue/shaman duo.
You just have to stay away from proccing weapons so root lasts a
while. 

Second way is to have the shaman load up her cheapest spell in the
cripple line (disempower?). It's cheap to cast and one cast is almost
always enough to turn the mob to the shaman. 

I never let the shaman pull when duoing with my rogue, a 40s lvl
shaman is gonna need some time to cannidance back mana in betweeen
battles.
