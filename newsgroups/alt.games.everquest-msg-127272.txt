Most of the time, this is my lineup

1) Selos
2) Hymn
3) Celerity
4) Chains
5) Fufil's
6) Bellow
7) Amplification
8) Solon's

My standard twist meleeing is 2 3 4 with amp
refreshed when it drops

Sometimes I switch to 3 4 5, if I"m having trouble
sticking chains the MR debuff seems to help, and if
I'm grouped it helps other casters stick magic based
lines as well as slapping the DOT damage in.

If I'm kiting I run 56665666 and refresh Amp, keeping
MR down, DOT on, and amped bellows does 30 per
click (which is faster than per tic) which isn't bad, although
the range and labor involved mean I am looking forward to
chant of flame...

Charm kiting, I do 8, switch targets and send pet, 5 2, back
to pet and repeat.  This is sloppily arranged, I suppose, should
work on it, but the rest of the song list has evolved slowly as
I play and although charm is now my bread and butter I hate
to have to relearn where everything goes.

I recently got TBoots, but Selos is still better for going out to find
mobs and best kept loaded for running away anyway.  I note
I no longer use it in any standard twist though.

My main swap out slots are 1) escape songs, generally for indoors
where I can't selo, and 6) bellows, which changes to clarity if
with casters, levitation or clouding for travel purposes, or other odds
and ends depending on the situation.
