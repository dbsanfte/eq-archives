I still pay for a port when I'm in a hurry to get somewhere, wizard or 
druid, makes no difference, never did.  As for buffs, druids do often 
buff 9 for cash in PoK.

Almost everywhere I xp, druids and clerics are used interchangably.  When 
the druid is not needed for healing, the druid can contribute some DPS as 
well as some useful buffs.  There are raid encounters where the extra 
FR/CR that a druid can contribute is essential, not many true.  Most 
raids, druids and clerics are used for healing together.  For most 
encounters shaman slow is far from essential, and shaman buffs are 
certainly not essential either.  Both are nice to have, but not required.

Realistically, there are very few xp group settings where it is essential 
to have one specific class, you just need one each from a few types of 
classes, and even that is not necessary, there have been many very odd 
groups that have worked quite well.
