Moulin can't tank in PoP for squat. She has tanked for XP in places
like Old Sebilis, Howling Stones, and on one memorable occasion,
Dragon Necropolis. But, in order to do so, she generally needs a
shaman in group and slowable MObs.

Currently, I'm leveling up a shaman in order to let her tank in more
places. Still, she'll be a ways off from tanking in PoP. I know only
two rogues on all of Torv who could with any consistency.
