    Old data but I found DL grouped to be the worst experience I've ever had
in the game.

    I used to frequently tell sub 40 people looking for group there to go
back to OT simply because the experience there is FASTER.

    DL solo on the other hand, was excellent experience right up until 52,
when the last of the ragers went light blue.

    Regarding high keep: It's the combination of overcrowding and incredibly
long waits for spawns. Quite frankly you can usually find at least 3
complete dickheads in any half popular zone, but in high keep they tend to
annoy one another and each spawn is so amazingly precious that they're worth
arguing with someone in a computer game about. IMO, badly designed zone.
Everquest is for dickheads too.

    You probably get a lot of /ooc fights in dreadlands because it is so
amazingly boring if you're grouped. Experience crawls and its safer than a
nerf ball.

Cheers,
James
