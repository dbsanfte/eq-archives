I'm trying to think if we have one 50+ ranger in our guild. I'm coming
up blank, though there may be. I know one is thinking of applying, but I
don't think we have any........
Note: This is *not* a comment on their usefullness, etc. It's just odd.
My old, mid-level guild was VERY ranger heavy. But I really think my
current guild which has a nice spread of 50+ folks has none.
