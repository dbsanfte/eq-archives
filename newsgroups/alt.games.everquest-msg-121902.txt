Hmm...I recently had my bards surname removed by a GM, which I accepted, as
I had given him the name through a fog of highly-scented smoke ;), and had
groaned when I saw it the next day. But now I have to petition if I want to
give him a new one. I read the revised naming policy on www.everquest.com
and petitioned to have my name changed to Didju Evah. This name is not
offensive, and does not break any of the naming policy rules and I didnt
think it would annoy anyone but the worst name-nazis. But when I petitioned,
I was told that the name was illegal and that I couldnt have it. When I
pointed out that it wasnt against the rules, I was told that the
words/phrase used are out of place in the EQ universe which would violate
rule 6. Hmm.
Who the hell are these people? Why the hell do they worry so much about what
I am called? Is it because they think that when other players see my name,
their suspension of disbelief will drop and they will come flooding back to
RL never to return? Is it because they think that other players' enjoyment
of the game will be reduced in some way?
Well....did you ever!
