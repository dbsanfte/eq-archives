i didnt come here to impress u from the standpoint of a gender

i dont cling to women, nor point to them, or anyone, to validate myself...

i dont think intellect has a thing to do with sex... unless ur doing tantric
LoL

u will adapt to me in time, or u will KF me... either is of no concern to me

peaceout, princess

ps - remember sex on tv is great ! as long as u dont fall off !  (wanted to
match that old school chewing bubble gum and walking joke at its own level)
;)



if u dont like my style darlin... what is the cutsey term for u guys... then
PLONK me
