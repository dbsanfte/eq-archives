I figured that the 3500 posts I've made to this group, not a one of
which was in d00dspeak, would at least mean that the long time readers
would recognize that I'm not a DAoC troll.

Actually, I think in some ways it would do Mythic good to become a bit
more like Verant.  I think DAoC would be better right now if Mythic
had adopted the "you're in our world now" attitude of Verant, and not
made as many adjustments as they did in response to whiners.

However, it would do Verant good to get some of Mythic's attitude
toward customer service.
