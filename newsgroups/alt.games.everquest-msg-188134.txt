Once upon a time, necro pets grew with age. They reverted in size, 
perhaps at 24 (I don't remember), and turned to a brownish red color, 
and then grew again as the level of pet grew. Then one got to the 60 
pet, which was a lovely spectre (note: all post 60s are spectres too). 
With the addition of SOL, the graphics were changed so they would be 
more uniform. I'v always hated that change, and thought it was boring to 
have identical skelly pets.

You may have encountered a bug with size difference still visible.
