I pair with a Ranger regularly. She and I fear kite. She snares and
puctures them with arrows, and I fear and mez for crowd control. I
breeze her, and she SoWs me. In an outdoors zone, she does more. In an
indoor zone, I do more. I like having a meat shield when I work, and
the Ranger gets the benefits of my spells.

For a druid, the back up root and the mezzing still help. I have done
things with a druid pairing, and after I tash the druid never has a
problem landing anything. Chain stuns, Whirls, my (stupid, stupid) pet
and enchanter debuffs make up for weaker (than a ranger) combat
ability of a druid IMHO.

I have not tried quad kiting wth a druid, so there I may not add much
because I try and prevent good quadding conditions. For a druid quads
are a kite; for a bard, those are a pull; for anyone else, it's a
train.
