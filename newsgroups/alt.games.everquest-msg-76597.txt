Hi!  I was wondering what happens if you want to quit your account for
awhile?  Lets say, as in my case, I want to play, but will be moving and
wouldn't be able to play for awhile.  Can you restart the account or how
does it work?

Also, what is the newest `normal` server?  I used to play on Veeshan, but Id
rather start on something where people are slightly lower in levels, or more
lower level people.

-Dak
