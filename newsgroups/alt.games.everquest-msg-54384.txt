Verant has tried the casino/money sink idea before in a much simpler
fashion a LONG time ago.  Where?  Lynuga's Gem Collection quest in
Innothule Swamp.  This quest involves turning in a Ruby to an evil
aligned NPC who gives you either nothing (rarely), one of two newbie
weapons (both common) or Ivandyr's Hoop (rarely) in return.  Each Ruby
costs something in the region of 135pp and it's quite possible to turn
in 50 and NOT get the earring as it appears to be completely random.

Add in another half dozen similar quests, make the key reward NO DROP
this time (the Hoop isn't) and you'll most likely attract a lot of
people willing to try their luck.
