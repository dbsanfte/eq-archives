    Good question, I think.  I would have to guess that the answer is that SOE
doesn't think there are that many newbies, and there are newbie zones that are
still unaffected, so it doesn't really matter.

   I do agree that the skelly placement is a bit foolish.  Butcherblock is
overrun with the things every night.  I'm bound at the Wayfarer camp in BB.  So
these days, when I die I find myself being beating on by some stupid green
skellys when I blink back in.  Of course at level 52 they don't really do much
damage even to a naked cleric.  But people of all ages past 20 hang out there. 
Often for extended periods of time while they wait for a group to form.  Why did
the skellys get put there?  I can only assume that SOE wanted to show off their
cleverness in having a highly aggressive army of greenies (to me at 52) annoy as
many people as possible.  Short of having he PoK and Bazaar over run, then the
zones of the Wayfarers are the next best choice.

   Anyone know if all the Wayfarer zones are afflicted, or just the most popular
one of BB?
