They have never wiped a character, even the level 1 purge that was supposed
to happen long ago never did.  To take a break, just go into the account
screen and stop payment.  When you're ready to come back, just sign in
and give it new payment info when it asks.

The tutorial is gone.

They took out the numbers many moons ago.  You can order the servers by
number of people on.  You want to be careful choosing a server this way
though, as the PvP servers are the lowest populated (any servers with
Zek in the name is a PvP server)

It's the newest server, therefore the least messed up economy.  However,
it has been up long enough for the truly dedicated to get characters to
65.

It may be that the name was simply taken by someone else.  It could also
be that it contained words, or misspellings of words that the filter looks
for.  For instance, it refused me the last name of Snapdragon (a flower
and also the name of a firework) because of the "dragon" in it.

You can assign keys to each camera view, you can also cycle through them
with the f9 key.  I'm a fan of 3rd person anyway, but I find it 
particularly helpful with small races.  Tap F9 2 times - then hit the
home key and the delete key a few times.  The result of this will be a
camera that is back from you a bit, at about head level but looking 
slightly down through your chest.  It allows you to see everything around
your feet, and only blocks things directly in front of you.  

You can mouselook to look around (hold the right mouse button to use it
to look up and down and turn)

Personally, I've left it WASD and just use my pinky to hit CTRL so I can
strafe.  EQ messed up the controls from the get go, and it's one of the 
things they haven't fixed.
