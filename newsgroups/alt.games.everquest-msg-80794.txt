Greetings all,

    I have a perplexing video problem that I could use assistance with
please.  When I zone in to a new zone, open certain bags, or open my spell
book the video gets very choppy.  Mouse movement slows incredibly.  My
system is a 400mhz celeron 256k ram & over 10mb still free on hard drive.
My graphics card is an ATI that came standard w/ the HP 6475 I have . pretty
low end if I remember correctly.  Are there any remedies short of upgrading
memory(my ram is maxed to my knowledge) and a new graphics card. My drivers
were updated w/ the release of luclin. Also I'm running the game in the old
graphics mode because of my less than sterling computer stats.  Any help is
appreciated!!
