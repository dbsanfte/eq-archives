	This is question that has been asked indirectly or only portions of it 
have been questioned and asked.  I want to play a beastlord, it's as 
simple as that.  My level 59 enchanter is too dull for my taste these 
days and I feel it is time to go melee.  Well not full melee...yet hehe, 
but I would be uncomfortable without any spells at this stage lol.  I 
have played an Iksar Beastlord up to level 18 on my usual server (Fennin 
Ro) and I have leveled up to 15 with an Ogre BL on Rallos.

	I want to become serious though with a BL character.  I want to know 
which race is best suited for the Beastlord class at low and high 
levels.  This goes along with carrying out a wortwhile role in groups 
and soloing throughout all the levels, with the exception of the 53+ 
monsters because thats when you usually need at least a partner to kill 
mobs that high (unless your well equipped and skilled).

	It does seem a little silly that I'm asking this after playing 2 BL's up 
a bit.  The situation is I don't know what the high level part of EQ 
would hold in store for them.  I believe the race will actually have an 
effect on a large portion of the game in terms of the BL playstyle.  If 
you play a BL as well please just briefly post the race, level, and 
playstyle of your character.  If you recommend a race for me pls specify 
where I should spend the creation points.  Finally, I'm terrible at 
twinking so any suggestions would be welcome.

Thank you,
Mafsto Clarifyre of The Fennin Ro server
