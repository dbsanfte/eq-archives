    Aye, but a lot of things don't stick out. And the invisible slots can be
anything - AC/HP gear on a tank, or "prom queen" gear.

    And the "no inspect" crowd wishes that you had to ask if you wanted to
know. Again, I can only guess at why, but that's what they want. There's
been a few threads about folks trying to disguise what they are to avoid
beggars by putting on odd graphic visible gear, so someone must care about
this.
