Hi,

I tried contacting SoE customer service regarding this, but they gave
me absolutely no straight answer.  I thought maybe the intelligent
people here could shed some light :)

Last year's 5th Anniversary of Everquest offered a 12 month
subscription to All Access Pass (i.e, EQ. EQ2, SWG, etc)..this year for
their 6th anniversary they did not offer this (only 12 month $99
Everquest-only).

My 12 month All Access subscription is up, and my account remains
active now with the old "5th Anniversary" promo listed as my next
subscription.  Nothing has been charged, and it lists next billing date
as several weeks ago.

I guess my question is if anyone knows if the All Access promo plan is
renewable.  My other accounts have the 12-month 5th anniversary promo
(EQ only) and they renewed no problem....but I suspect because there is
a similar 6th anniversary 12 month promo available.

Any ideas?

Thanks

Kadi
