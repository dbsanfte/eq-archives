I have a character with a running death count in the description box,
updated after every death.  A ranger.  :)

My level 60 monk has racked up 10 *unrezzed* deaths in 60 since Luclin came
out (most of those in the first couple weeks while exploring).  I still have
yet to lose 60, but it's a damn good thing I know how to grind quickly.  :)

As a raid puller, I long ago lost count of my deaths.  But I've gone through
10 corpses in a night many times.
