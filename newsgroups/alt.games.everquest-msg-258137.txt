Nah... more spam isn't a good thing.  Tanks that call assist on everything
are almost as bad as healers that call every single heal.   Which are only
slightly above anyone with a "assisting main tank" hotkey.    I don't think
I've called assist in the regular course of an exp group in about 15 levels.

The only exceptions being when it actually is needed.   When multiple mobs
arrive at camp, and the enchanter needs to know which one not to mez.   And
anytime the fight requires a switch in the main target.    Other than that,
you should already be assisting me, and often.

Calling assist all the time tends to dilute the power of the message.   Spam
fades into the background and gets ignored.   An assist message that you
only see hit a few times a night though... thats much more noticable.
