Last night, after patching, after entering my password, Everquest would crash.

I went into chat, looking for help. (Ha!)

One guy suggested changing the videobitsperpixel from 16 to 32. Mine was already at 32.

Another suggested disabling Kunark models. I didn't understand why I didn't need to before but did now, but tried doing that anyway.
Still crashed. When I reopened the ini file, the values I had changed were changed back.

Finally someone else suggested deleting the eqclient.ini file. I figured the program would probably make another one and, if not, I
could still recover it from my recycle bin. Deleted the file and finally was able to play.
