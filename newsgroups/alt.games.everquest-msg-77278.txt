>>> As a thought experiment could one the more experienced gamers imagine
themselves as being a hired consultant for a raid. <<<

Here is a suggestion on that end ...

On Prexus, one of the raid capable guilds had a "raid class" for their new
and lower level guildees (I don't remember which guild it was). They held it
in Mistmoore, and was basically teaching as they were raiding, explaining
what they should look for, be aware of, things of that nature.

Maybe you could hire an experienced raider to take your guild to a lower
level, generally unused dungeon (Mistmoore, Najena, Runnyeye) and teach you
the mechanics of a raid first. That way, if something does go wrong, it's
not a total wipeout with a headache CR.

Remember that you can enter the planes at level 46, and the old school
dragons (Vox, Naggy, etc) could help teach you about dragon raids.
