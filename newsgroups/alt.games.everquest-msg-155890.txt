/applaud

I was helping out a raid the other day. They asked if I had a main so after
my enchanter tashed the boss I could log him in and be useful.
I decided they could go to hell.
I probably wouldn't have pissed them off so much if I hadn't pillaged my
group before gating.
They petitioned me.
The guide told me: That was sweet, but I wouldn't do it again... some of the
guides are anal and might have put a warning on your account. Have a nice
day.
I play what I play because he is what I want to play. If you don't like it,
shutup or don't ask for anything from me.
