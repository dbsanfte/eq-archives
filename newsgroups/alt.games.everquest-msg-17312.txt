This may be slightly tangential, but regardless of how balanced the
classes in fact are, the reality is that being accepted into a group is
based on the *perceived* balance/utility of the classes. I was in EC
yesterday, and noticed that a 49 ogre SK from whom I had made some
purchases earlier in my career was auctioning off his best equipment
(Noc blade specifically). When I asked him why the heck he would sell
such a thing, he responded that he was quitting his 49 SK because he
could never get into a group. Seems he was always told to take a hike
since he wasn't a warrior or rogue. Now, I hope that most people
wouldn't really be so narrowminded, but I can see that happening
frequently enough to really discourage some people.
