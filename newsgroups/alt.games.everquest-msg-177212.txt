> How is Role Playing ??

I play almost exclusively on Firiona Vie now. RP is not necessarily 
widespread, but it is much more accepted when you choose to do so than on 
some other servers. I've found that often people will join in with you.
 
> Is it worse wth kewl dudes and so on?? Or have things relaxed ??

You still have power gamers around. I don't find them to be a huge 
problem though.

That hasn't changed much.

My highest character is a 38 and I have never camped *anything* for more 
than 20 minutes or so.

Never heard of anyone getting smacked that hard without a GM helping em 
out some afterwards.

Yes, but now clerics and paladins get rezzes much earlier for at least 
partial xp. I don't normally have too much trouble getting at least half 
my xp back.
