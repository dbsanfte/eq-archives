I posted a few days ago to sell my mule account.

I've been reading a lot of the posts and am thinking about starting back
into EQ.  I quit playing last February.   I started playing a week after EQ
came live out of beta.  I played on a PVP server and then went to the
Nameless server less than an hour after it opened up.  I played there for a
couple years.

I had on my main accounts,  a 60 bard and a 54 cleric, and had been given an
account with a 51 chanter on it by a friend that had quit. (read 4 accounts,
3 played and one mule account).   I finally got really tired of all the
raids and demanding guild schedule.  I was in one of the leading guilds in
EQ.  We were among the first couple guilds to dominate the "new" Kunark
zones across all servers,  and same with Velious.   The first wizard best of
the best was won by a wizard in my guild at lvl 59.  He was the first non
lvl 60 to win a BOTB.   It got to the point where EQ had overpowered my
family.   I finally quit playing on the Nameless when some people in my
guild got mad because we were short on bards for a raid and I needed to log
off to do something with my daughter.  I never played on the Nameless again
except to log on and say hi to some friends there off and on.   I started a
bard on Brell server and really enjoyed playing again,  untwinked,  working
up my skills and not in a raiding guild or anything.  I made it to lvl 51 in
less than 2 months and without putting as much time as you would think into
it.  Well,  about lvl 51 it got to the point where you either raid and get
bored spending ungodly amounts of time on EQ or you just don't advance much
at all.    I finally just gave it up completely.

I am thinking about starting a new character on a totally new server again.
There is so much out that is new now since I have played.  I have friends
that want me to come out of retirement with my 60 bard,  but it would end up
being for raids and stuff again,  so no way.

What are the newest servers now?  and are there any servers that are mainly
just role play servers?
