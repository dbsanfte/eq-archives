One of the reasons they changed to a 'smart' patcher is so people cannot just
download the patcher executable and have the patch program download all the
Luclin/retextured zones.

The new patch program is hardcoded to not download more than 100MB of files. 
If you try to download the SoL/retextured zones without having installed them
from CD, it will give you a message about the size being exceeded.

Of course, there's other methods to download the files.  ;)  Also, if you want
to use the retextured zones, you don't need to be SoL registered for that.
