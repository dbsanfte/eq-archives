I decided it's time I made another level...been 52 for most of the year, it
seems.
So, remembering how much Jazz raves about the place and how empty it's meant
to be, I try The Hole.

The entrance to the Hole I found was ideal, easy to control, fast exp.
Unfortunately, if this is taken, I don't seem to be able to go further
in...this is mainly due to the fact that the party there already seem to
over do it every other pull and zone, I'm left with fight or flight and when
I did stay and fight the other party returned to break my Mez'd Crusader and
Warrior...flight then.
Assuming I am stuck behind a competent group, one day, is there anywhere
further in to The Hole suitable for 3 Boxing, Warrior, Druid and Enchanter
(all 52) or should I leave it unless I can have the entrance.
