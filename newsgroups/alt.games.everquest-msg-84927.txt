Nonsense. This newsgroup has many highly credible posters in it, and
all of them are effectively anonymous.

They are not credible by virtue of being 'accountable', they are
credible because they've demonstrated themselves to be so during their
posting history.

The topic gets that way every time some whelp gets upset over the idea
that some people play by the rules, and expect everyone else to also.
