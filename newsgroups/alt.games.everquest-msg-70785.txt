Well............ yes.
They're our clerics. They rez us, they symbol us, they rez us, they
Shield us, they rez us, they......
I'm sure you get the point.
If I get a fair roll at any high value stuff, or armor/weapons usable by
my class, if the cleric walks out with a couple KPP worth of lower value
gems... I say /cheer cleric_01

Kind of surprised you don't. High level clerics are rare enough.
Anything you or your guild can do to keep them happy is pretty much ok
in my book if some chump change is all it's costing you.
