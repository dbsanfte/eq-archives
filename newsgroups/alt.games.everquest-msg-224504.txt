You need to spend 6 points in general, I did 3 in Run Speed, and 3 in 
Innate Regeneration.  3/tick hp extra regen is not huge, but it does add 
up over time.  Another possibility, is if you have a horse or drogmor, 
then enhanced metabolism is worthwhile to get.

General wisdom is to level first, AA later, it's much easier to get the 
AA points, and level counts for so much as far as spell resists and such.

Each AA point is equivalent to leveling from 51 to 52, or is it 50 to 51?  
Anyway, it is equivalent to getting one regular xp level at somewhere 
around there.  That is why it becomes so much easier to get AA at higher 
levels.  As a 65 shaman, I can easily solo mobs that give me 5 to 6% of 
an AA point per kill.  I'm a lot slower at it than the really good 
soloing classes, but, it gets the job done.  In the high 50s, I could 
solo in PoN and get about 1.5% AA per kill.
