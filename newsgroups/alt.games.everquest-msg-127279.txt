Perfectly understandable. However, the point is that instead of telling him
where to look in the future, he got griped at.

It's not hard to say, "Hey, next time look on http://eq.castersrealm.com for
all the news you need."

Now rather than becoming his crutch and source of information forever, he
will know where to look in order to find out what he needs. That was
basically my original point.

you feed him for a lifetime."
