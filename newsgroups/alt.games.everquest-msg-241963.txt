You aren't going to get  skill ups often from light blues.

Find a group taking evens or yellows and ask if you can whack on them
for weapon skillups. (I'd stick to creatures  right around your
level... they seem to work best for skillups.)

It sounds like  you are a caster so their is no chance you will KS
them and they should be fine with it. (but don't be an ass about it if
they aren't... find another group.)

If you happen to be a knight and there is a chance you can KS, or
'threaten to KS' offer to hold back until the mob is less than 75%.

And in these situations your on your own for healing, buffing, etc
(which if you are careful you won't need). Don't expect the group to
take care of you, don't loot, don't get in the way, don't taunt, etc.
Try to be as unobtrusive about it as possible.

You might want to arrange to get your stats buffed, to help with
skillup frequency.

Other than that, look for places where full groups chain single pull
pure melee mobs to a single spot.
