Here's another fun lunar fact that is not well known.  If you calculate
the force on the Moon from Earth's gravity, and then calculate the force
on the Moon from the Sun's gravity, you'd find that the Sun's is stronger.
If you were to trace out the Moon's path for a year, so you get a curve
going around the Sun, you'd find that curve to be everywhere convex.

Basically, the Moon isn't really going around the Earth.  A more
accurate description is that the Earth and the Moon are both going
around the Sun, each alternatively cutting inside the orbit of the other
12 times per lap.  The Moon is the only moon in the solar system that
does this, and considering how big it is relative to the Earth (way
bigger than any other moon), the Earth/Moon are really two planets in
similar orbits, rather than a planet and its moon.
