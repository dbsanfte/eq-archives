Well, I don't want to get into who's the better soloer, Monk or Druid, but I
do see this "oh Druids can quad" crap all the time.

Yes, druids "can" quad. But where? Especially at higher levels? Quadding
requires non-resitant, low HP, social mobs, all within decent proximity of
each other in an area with decent visiblity and little chance of adds. Areas
like this are usually full of other campers who scream a blue storm when a
Druid or Wiz tries to quad. There are just a handful of zones in the game
where this is really practical and many of the MOBs that are quaddable have
no loot.

A blown quad  - adds, someone interferes, lag, excessive resists - can lead
to 20 minutes downtime medding without a single kill. In order for quadding
to be efficient, you MUST succeed with 4 MOBs almost every time.

I do quad from time to time, and it IS a great source of exp (and fun to do
as well), but its always in out of the way places (IC, TD), or very late at
night when zones are empty.
