Ummm... I need to get this lingo down. I undestood a very small percentage
of the above. LOL!

Where do you suggest for a level 21 beastlord, other than PC. I really need
to find someplace else to take this character. I'm so burnt out on PC. Is
South Karana still a good place to go? What/where is LoIO? Keep in mind, I'm
one of those poor characters that doesn't have top notch weapons and armor.

Thanks for the tips here. Is Splitpaw a zone or someplace in a zone? I might
have to take my warrior there. He's a level 13 right now and he's got a
level 14 shammy buddy that usually groups with him. This could be a good
place to hunt. It's something different!
