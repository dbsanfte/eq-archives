I had a similar issue a while back, only, it was *clothing* that wasn't
being drawn!!!  That was really weird... (ever zone into Rivervale, and
every single halfling was NUDE???  *deletes the mental images*)  Turns out
it was because I was playing around and did the /dopropertinting thing...  I
couldn't even turn it *off* after that... had to manually edit the
eqclient.ini to take out the DoProperTinting = TRUE line...  Gah.. :)
