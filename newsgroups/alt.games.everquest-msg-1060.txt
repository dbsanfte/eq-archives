Be warned, though.  Unless this has been changed (which I've not heard of
happening), the mend skill in the 90's is a horror!  For some reason, you will
fail more often in 90's than since you were back in 20's.  And you will also
hurt yourself more often.  But once you hit 100, no more failures.  Oh, and it
heals/hurts 25%, not 30 as someone said.  Watch the numbers.  Use a calculator
(unless they changed this without notice, also)...
