I don't have an iksar necro so I don't know for sure.  But I haven't seen 
anyone with a human pet.  Does this happen to everyone?  If not it might be 
related to the problem of wolves looking strange a while back.  Try 
deleting the .txc files from your everquest directory to see if the 
problems goes away.
