Because for the first 2.5 years of EQ, Rangers were piss-poor with no 
reson d'etra. They couldn't do anything that really made them a good 
group player and couldn't solo all that well either. So SOE balanced it 
by giving them higher DPS so that they would be wanted in groups.

It really is balanced fairly well. I don't know why there are warriors 
whining in this thread, because they are still the most coveted melee 
class at high levels. Without a good warrior to tank the MOBs in raid 
encounters, your raid is over.
