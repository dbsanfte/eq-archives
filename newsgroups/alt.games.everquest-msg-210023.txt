7th level? Fighting a dragon? D&D must have changed over the last
twenty odd years. Are you sure you weren't fighting a chicken? Or
maybe a little girl?

I have a 54th level Cleric. Never taken him on a raid yet. Been MA on
a few Vox, Naggy raids with my Warrior, but that's pretty much the
extent of my raiding experience.

I'm familiar with the concept of the CH chain, but have never seen one
or been in one. At 54, I suppose I should probably start learning
about it.

Would you mind giving some particulars on the CH chain? Do all the
Clerics join the same group? Is it as simple as knowing the order of
the chain, seeing who goes before me cast and then counting "one
mississippi, two mississippi, three mississippi, x mississippi", then
"I am now CHing %t!"? Obvioulsy, watching for "skip" or "oom" and
knowing the complete order of the chain sounds like a necessity. As
well as throwing in occasional spot heals.

Anyways, if you could tell me whatever you told those Clerics in
Veksar, that would be great.

thanks,
