Did I miss something?  Last I heard, only the murder conviction was
overturned, and she is subject to being prosecuted again on that charge.
She, and her husband were both convicted of 2 lesser charges, and last I
knew, those held up.  I do agree that the prosecuters should probably have
included some lesser manslaughter charges as well, and, they can probably do
so, if they choose to prosecute again.
