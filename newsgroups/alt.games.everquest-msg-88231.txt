Ok let me start this out by saying no harsh words were exchanged,
quite the opposite, I met a really nice fellow player.

Now I do understand, it's sometimes hard to tell when to help out a
player and when to mind your own bees wax. When I screw up I say I'm
sorry and explain I thought they were in trouble. The majority of the
time I was right and get a hearty thank you, or at least I tried and
didn't get the kill before they went down or in one case I went down.
But hey it was my choice. The more I play the easier it is to tell
when to step in and when to stay out.

Then there is the player you see running like a bat outa hell. only to
find they are pulling. Now this isn't queit as easy to tell unless you
see the others in the party or something else a long this line. Again
an "I'm sorry" works pretty well.

I was on a tour of places I had never been, which is most every where
and was enjoying myself for the most part. I got to Freeport and
figured out how to get around and find the important things. Headed
towards the comman lands. and picked up a couple Deathfist belts. Well
I knew from the Crushbone belts that these probably were a turn in
item so figured it out and faction went up, ahhh how cool, need a
bunch of these I said to myself. Headed back to the orc camps and
found a good one only it was camped big time, must have been at least
half a dozen players there. But to my surprise the orcs were spawned
and in their camp and no one was doing anything. Weird I thought. So I
snare the big guy outa the orcs and they all come running towards me,
no biggie. Well the players suddenly all get active and start bashing
on the orcs also, that's cool I thought, at least I'll get a few which
I thought I had done. When it was over I got one, that was it, I had
wailed big time on at least two others I had thought. Well I headed
off, way over camped and as far as I was concerned and it felt like it
was kill stealing on their part. I was prepared to take out the whole
orc camp or die in the attempt. So I get this tell from a guy that was
camped there, seems they were waiting for their healers to get their
mana back and I was the one that was being looked at in the kill
stealing light. Now first of all I'm not a mind reader, second of all
they out numbered the orcs big time, although the one orc probably
conned pretty high to some of them, thirdly no one offered to let me
group. Now this is bull shit. What the fuck are others suppose to do
while they're sitting on their asses? Read them bed time stories while
they med? Don't get me wrong I think you've got to share and share
alike when you've got only so many bad guys to go around. Don't they
know when they spawn they've spawned, time for action. It doesn't take
that friggin long to med. But this left me with such a sour taste I
left the area that took me almost a full night to get to. Maybe I'm
all wrong on how I see this and am curious as to how others here feel
about it.
