I've heard that, if your skill is in a "higher range" than your
trophy, the trophy evolves faster.  So if I get my skill to 200,
with my trophy (gotten at 188) evolved only about 25% of the way
to the next level, it'll start evolving faster if I continue to
do non-trivial combines.  Of course, if my goal were just to get
to 200, that's still scant compensation, unless it evolves a LOT
faster.
