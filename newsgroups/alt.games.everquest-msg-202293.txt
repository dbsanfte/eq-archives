...when they get close enough that the only reason to be there is to
camp SF or hunt the cougars in the immediate area.  It is a bit
ridiculous to send a tell to anyone who enters the zone.  That's the
point.  You can simply keep checking track and anyone who gets close
enough, start tracking and go /con them.  If they /con too low to camp
SF, then they are hunting cougars, thus commence buffing.  If they
/con high enough to camp SF, politely send a tell.

...and if they con high enough to camp SF, look like they could
outdamage, and either respond with a nasty "SF is FFA, go screw
yourself" then start sending tells to friends.  <g>
