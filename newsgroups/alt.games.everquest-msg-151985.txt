The quests an absolute pita

Getting the faction in the first place is a real shitty job, I've done about
10 hours of ae'ing and running a bot to kill there, and im at threatening
(handed in about 8 stacks of salts and skins so far)

Getting Drus is even more insane.  On Prexus she's massively contested
(she's dead within 30mins of server up / popping) and the urn is super rare.

But you do get some absolutely superb arms, which as well as the 100hp, have
AoB (which stacks), you also get a ring thats likely to be better than 1 of
the rings your currently using.  The DS on the ring lasts about 25(?) mins
too
