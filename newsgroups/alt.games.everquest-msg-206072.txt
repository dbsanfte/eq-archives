The normal damage that a weapon will do most frequently is dmg x 2 + 1.  
I would expect to see a lot of hits for 27 plus or minus a few, with a 
few hits for the maximum damage, don't recall what that works out to.  
Depending on the mobs you are fighting, you may also see numerous hits 
for 1 point and other low numbers.  For melee classes, the magic number 
(most frequent hit amount) is dmg x 2 + 1 + damage bonus when using a 2 
hander or for a one hander in the primary hand, for the off hand, it is 
the same as for non melee classes dmg x 2 + 1.
