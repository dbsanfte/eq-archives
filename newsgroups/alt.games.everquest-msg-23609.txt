---Large sob story about the goods snipped---
    Ok,
First off, Goods and Neuts are in the same boat in Sullon Zek.  Both teams are
outnumbered, outleveled, out-cashed by the evils.  Not only that, both teams put
together are outnumbered, outleveled, and out-cashed by the evils. And I think
the main problem is the victim mentality that most goods have.  Halas and
Everfrost are not Neut zones.  Last I heard, the tundra was heavily guarded by
goods.  The neuts were being told to leave or be PK'ed.  I was actually told by
a wondering PC to promise to get a bind in queynos or he'd pk me.  And the neuts
are the same way for the most part.  Verant wants us to stick to our newbie
zones.  The goods and newts have the best newbie zones outside of the Iksar.
You can level to at least 35 in EF.  There's Blackburrow and EF for all players
starting in Halas, Qeynos, and Erudin. And no, Erudites won't have a problem
coming over because their isn't an evil presence in between Odus and Qeynos.
Also, Dwarves have Butcherblock, Wood and High Elves have orc hil, albeit not
great but at least it balances the DF slashed belt quest that the evils have in
EC.  And Halfling have Mistythicket and HH right there as well.  Honestly, what
does a barbarian really need to get the Faydark for?  If goods and neuts would
just stop acting victimized and biting the closest person to them out of fear,
we'd all be in much bettter condition.
