 Who knows if he'll come back. However, on servers that have woken him,
he is no longer around. The Warders have been replaced with Ancients or
whatever. Same thing basically just a different name. A little meaner
probably but I never fought the old Warders so I can't say for sure.

 For servers that haven't woken him yet, if any exist, I think he's
still there along with the Warders. That's just me guessing though.
Someone on one of those servers can confirm or deny!
