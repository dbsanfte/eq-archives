Monster missions are just like LDoN adventures, except your group is turned
into monsters, with corresponding abilities.  Open up the AA window when you
start one and it should be pretty self explanatory.  They are all group
missions as far as I can tell.  I was hoping I could be Naggy solo, but no
such luck.  They start in various locations, some in old world like
Butcherblock and Lavastorm, and some in the new DoD zones.

Shrouds just turn you into a monster out in the regular world, with
corresponding abilities (again, AA window).

My best hints, and ones I wish someone had told me, is to turn off guild
tribute before using a monster mission or a shroud, save your hotkey set
before using a monster mission or a shroud, and save your hotkey setup for
every monster mission or shroud.  Doing those things will eliminate much
frustration.
