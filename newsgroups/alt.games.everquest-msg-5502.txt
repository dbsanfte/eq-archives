Tell you what, you offer your thoughts about what Zeppo did, then I'll
consider replying. Meanwhile, if you don't like how someone is
posting, you have the same options we all do.

When someone manages to do something to maintain the quality of the
newsgroup, I do consider that a victory.

It doesn't require justification. Zeppo broke the rules of his service
provider, and he broke the unwritten rules of social conduct that make
a newsgroup useful. He now has experienced the consequences of his
behavior.

Odd. I've read the entire thread, and I don't recall seeing DT post
anything that would equate to that. Maybe it was your straw man who
said those things?
