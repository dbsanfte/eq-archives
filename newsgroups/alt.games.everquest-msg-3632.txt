I've certainly noticed this and must agree that those bars
are mere estimates in the short term.  Still, the -overall- effect
seems to work...

I didn't suggest timing thing, just that -on average- I was mostly
sitting on the cycle.  If its gradual and the "cycle" is a server/client
illusion, then I was still getting the benefits of sitting most of the
time, in fact we can discard the off chance that I might somehow
get in sync with the cycle such that I'd happen to be standing
-every- time it hit instead of only occaisionally.

This happens due to the "discount" you get for specialization
in that spell type: the system checks to see if you can pay
the full price, even though in practice you may almost never
have to do so.  Thus, (long before I took up the bounce practice)
I used to try to pop off a SHeal, get that message, sit for only
a couple seconds, just enough to see a mana spurt, stand, cast,
and have almost a full bub of mana left over.
