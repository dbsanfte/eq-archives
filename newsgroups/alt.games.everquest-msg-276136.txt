I've never played EQ1 and EQ2 is my first ever MMORPG (Loving it so far). 
I'm just a bit annoyed that I have spent all this time crafting with my 
carpenter and done very well with sales and have nothing to spend my money 
on :(

I do have a horse which I totally love, but apart from that there doesnt 
seem much else I can buy.
