You will not evade me, foamyis@home.com (foamy):


>Druid / Monk   a lot of people think this is terrific

It is.

>Druid / Enchanter
>Druid / Wiz
>Druid / Ranger

The ranger is a bit too much alike the druid to be a really efficient
duo - mind you, it can be done.

>Druid / Shaman
>Druid / SK

Fear kite with a tank.

>I don't want to play a Monk or a SK. I'd love to play an Iksar Shaman
>but would it be a problem teaming up with a non-hated character ?

No more than you'd normally have grouping with good characters or
playing in zones where the guards hate you.

>What about druid / druid ...would they be redundant and therefore 
>not a good choice ?

If you root dot, you'd be redundant since your dots don't stack, a
druid/necro team would be better in that respect and could also fear
kite with pet as tank.

>For a wiz, I guess the best choice would be an Erodite ?

There's no such thing as 'best choice' within a race, especially for
int casters. The slightly smaller base mana pool of another race means
you spend a few less ticks medding back to full mana and might have to
buy a few more items to hit 200 int, nothing else. The best race is
the one you enjoy playing - I have a friend who plays a human wizard,
for instance.

My new favorite duo other than druid/monk is druid/mage. Pet tanks,
both of us nuke as appropriate, I heal and dot as appropriate. I've
also been in several great triads with wizards and mages.
