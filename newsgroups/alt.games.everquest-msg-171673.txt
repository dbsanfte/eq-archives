I can understand giving up.  Research is a real pain.  I have a level 29
necro who's kind of stalled out right now and my sons stalled at 24 because
of research.  I have 4 BP's FULL of words in the bank and yet it seems I
NEVER have the ones I need.  On the important spells I got a higher level
necro to combine for me, meaning I didn't get any skill increases from
trying, but I just couldn't risk missing out on the spell. So it wouldn't
bother me a bit to buy the spells and skillup research on duplicates.

I think you have a sound business plan.
