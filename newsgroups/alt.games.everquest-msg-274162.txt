yeah ok, so you've never used it and I've heard it.

In case you just happened to jump in late, I'm talking specifically about
the term "pussy" as used to describe a coward.

If you're not jumping in late you know this and chosing to ignore it.  In
which case don't bother reading on.

yes and if you bother to read we are discussing specifically "pussy" being
used for wimp.  In that case it most certainly is short for pussy cat.

Now in case you also think cats are only used in a fearless or aggressive
sense, think of what kids say about cats and cowardice all the
time -"scaredy cat", "'fraidy cat", "scat cat" (and the last is used for
scatter), let's stem that one fast enough.


> And no it's not extremely sexist as it is not alluding to females."

I am saying "pussy" for wimp does not allude to females.  It has nothing to
do with any part of the female anatomy used this way hence it can not be
sexist.

If you think that they are the same, then provide your citations.




Should I start snipping part of your posts so that things are taken out of
context and thus say that things which you are specifically referring to are
things you're making generalisations about?

sure they lied.  Taking something out of context to give it a different
meaning is lying.  You'll notice I do not label people as such until they
repeatedly do so in case it was simply a mistake.

I can only recall claiming Palindrome to be a liar.  And he went on to
demonstarte himself to be a bald faced liar.  If I didn't call Lokari a
liar, she is deserving of the label.

Are you always this terribly fond of making generalisations out of specifics
in order to attempt making a point?

Just this one person, and it was pointed out already by someone else - she
slipped up early.  This is yet another inaccurate generalisation by
yourself.

Further, s/he says she finds no offence with the actual term but can
understand that others can which is why s/he is arguing.  However, when
pointed out this is exactly what s/he is doing and setting out to do in
his/her sig, s/he heightens the level of insult, showing her/himself to be a
hypocrite.
