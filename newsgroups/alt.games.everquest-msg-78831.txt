No, you'll find that I had no complaint about them changing
the Soulbinders to be level 1 NPCs in order to "do what they can
to prevent people from 'cheating' the system".  It was an
elegant solution and it resolved the issue entirely.

What I did find ridiculous was sending the Soulbinder Police(tm)
out to watch for nefarious players doing such dastardly things
as getting a few easy weapon skill ups for a few days out of
the year+ life of their character.  Big whoop-de-fucking-do.

Especially when, if Guides/GMs are going to sit somewhere
and "babysit", they'd be able to spend their time far more
productively hanging out at, say, South Ro to watch all the
people blatantly killstealing each other in order to
try to get JBoots (for just one example of many).  *That*
sort of behavior (to which the Guides always say, "nothing
we can do unless we actually see it happen") does far
more damage to the player community than a few people
getting some giggles whacking on an NPC that doesn't
fight back until it gets fixed in the next patch
(and which has such a huge number of HP that it's useless
for getting exp from).

I repeat -- PRIORITIES.  A few weapon skill-ups is
*way* down on the list of things that can screw up the game
or the player community.  If I were running the Guide/GM
department, I'd have told them to wish the Soulbinder
smackers Merry Christmas and enjoy the silly NPCs while they
last because they'll be tweaked soon.  Call it an unintentional
GM event and go find some more important exploiters to
try to catch in the act of doing more damaging exploiting.

Let's face it, it's not that hard/dangerous/long to crank
up your weapon skills the "old fashioned way" even if
you've neglected them a while.  So temporarily being able 
to crank them up in town instead of "out in the field" just 
ain't that big of a deal.  I fail to see how it's any
more "dangerous" to the game than the way people can
put their characters on autorun while in the water, stick
them nose-first into a corner with their heads barely
above water, and get 45 swimming skill increases while
they go out for a pizza (as opposed to doing it the
"intended" way of steering your character around and
around in the water manually.

You clearly have a different view of the matter, but
this is mine.

Me too, but my point, which you seem to have missed, is
that there are bigger things they could be policing with the
limited time and manpower that they have.  This issue is
about as trivial as it can be.
