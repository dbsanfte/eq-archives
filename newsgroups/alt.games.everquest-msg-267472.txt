I don't believe it is a money sink in this game.
There are items you can make and sell back to the vendor at at profit. 
The profit is small and it takes time to make an item so you're not 
going to get rich like this but nether are you going to lose money if 
you carefully choose ehat to make.

And of course it's possible to make items people want like spells, 
skills, bags,some armour and weapons after only a few tradeskill levels.

At the moment spells and skills that can be made at tradeskill level 9 
or below seem to sell as fast as I can make them for 4-5 sp each so I've 
made a few hundred silver and skilled up making them.
