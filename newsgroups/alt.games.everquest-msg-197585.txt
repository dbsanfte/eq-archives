It was a comment about your English looking very French. Don't worry,
it is understandable English :)

"Ideally" wizards put everything they can into INT. When you wrote you
used them randomly, that could have meant you had done something like
put points into WIS, which is useless for a wizard. However, your
choices should work pretty well for you :)

As you progress, you can also get lightstones, or if you have the
planes of power expansion, you can do a quest in plane of knowledge:
you deliver items between numerous NPC and receive an item with 1 ac
and 2 cha which fits in your range slot and is a light source. This
quest is described at:
