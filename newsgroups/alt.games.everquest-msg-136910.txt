I think you have nothing to worry about. Is *every* uberguild on Drinal
on that list? Do they have *every* one of their cleric alt/bots who
doesn't have the epic yet signed up? 

No?

Then I give your list a month at best.

A big guild will come in and take Rage again when they need to, outrage
will happen, and harsh words will fly across server message boards
(which will be exact reruns of the same flame wars that happen every few
months on every server). Somebody will declare they are sick of it and
jump the next Ragefire pop with a full raid force. The list disolves
into mayhem, and you get your epic the next time *you* can have a dragon
level raid force there waiting when he pops.

In the end, I'm afraid Ragefire will always be a First-in-Force
encounter. The best way to improve your chances for a smaller guild
cleric (ours is too, and we are close to our second click stick now) is
to get in a coallition with a few clerics from other small, allied
guilds. If just the few of you agree to not only take turns, but to have
your guilds help each other, you could keep a raid force onsite pretty
much all the time. Then, when it pops, you engage before anybody else
has time to port in a raid force.

It's a nice part of Skyfire where folks can get xp all the way up to
level sixty, and some nice spells drop there, along with other odds and
ends. Also, Talendor pops every once in a while, and if you already have
a raid force there anyway, he's got a pretty nice loot table. (Dupe of
Naggy's, isn't it? Or close to it anyway.)
