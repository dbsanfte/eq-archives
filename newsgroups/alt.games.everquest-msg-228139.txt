We had an incident last night with a guildy that I would like to put
forward to AGE for opinion.

One of our guild members boasted in /gu that he had sold a Plate
(*not* ornate) Greaves Mold for 25k. His exact quote was "I can't
believe they fell for it".

Our guild is one of the "good" ones, made up of people who have
integrity and even play by the "play nice" policy when being
steamrolled or are otherwise subjected to bad behavior of other
guilds.

This incident caused a lengthy debate in the officer channel, with
about half of the respondents saying it was the victims fault for not
paying attention, while the other half shared the opinion that the
seller nothing wrong since he did not "adverstise" or mislead buyers
into "thinking" it was actually an ornate mold, not one that could be
purchased for a nominal cost from NPC vendors.

While I find this action reprehensible, the guildy's vendor is not in
the guild, nor do we have a victim. I tried unsuccessfully to track
down the vic.

For what it's worth, it reveals to me that at least one of our members
will stoop to unethical behavior, and further, that he is stupid
enough to brag of his scam. I feel sorry for the poor soul who lost a
great deal of possibly hard-earned money, perhaps from a simple
oversight, but clearly to someone with no conscience.

Offered for your consideration, thanks for your time.
