}> I can affirm that Innoruuk-lovin' DE wizzies are dubious, and that DE SKs

}Seems to be dubious in most places in Qeynos.  There are so many 
}flipping places in there, it seems like.  Or maybe it's just me.  
}Anyway, I ran around to *most* places and conned people once I was 
}bound, and nobody kicked my ass, at least...

/em adds data to his secret faction database.

}I'm still curious about the sewers, but as I still can't manage down 
}there even *with* a map, and I don't exactly feel like sneak/hiding my 
}way into complete "where the fuck am I?"ness, it may be awhile before I 
}can confirm down there *g*

My wizard was also dubious to Bloodsabres, as I recall.  It's been a while 
tho.

}(Oh, plus I mistakenly turned in 2 rabid pelts and a couple dozen gnoll 
}teeth before remembering, oops, I may NEED that faction...)

Yeap. :) luckily, I'm pretty sure those faction hits are small.  You need 
Bloodsaber faction to get the enchanter epic quest started.  Here's a link 
to my post on eqbeastiary on the subject, should you end up needing to 
repair it without messing any other factions up.

Wow.  It didn't wrap.  Thanks Illia!

}(PS - is Innoruk-lovin' legal?)

Only in certain states, with a permit.
