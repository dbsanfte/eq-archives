I don't think moving that box is possible.  If you find out differently,
PLEASE post it...it bugs me too.

As for going pre-Velious you could rename your EQ folder then reinstall EQ
and RoK...but you wouldn't be able to get into Velious.  You wouldn't be
able to get into Velious without reinstalling that expansion and clicking on
the Velious Patch button...and your new folder would look remarkably like
your old one.

If you can't figure out how to move it, the only way to almost get what you
want would be to be in windowed view all the time.
