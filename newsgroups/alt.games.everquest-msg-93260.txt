I've got a piece of paper somewhere certifying my IQ as 186. A group of
us at University to the tests with MENSA for a laugh. Proper, timed,
written, sitdown test, watched over by MENSA 'officials'. 186 was very
high even in MENSA. 174 I believe is the top 99.9 percentile (1 in
1000). 

Have I ever made use of the things tested? Of course not. It's mainly
logic, lateral thinking, and manipulation of mathematical problems, with
a chunk of vocabulary and language thrown in. If your brain is suited to
that type of thing, you get a high score. Mine was, and I did.

The most important part of IQ, is the 'Q'. It stands for Quotient, and
your age is a divisor. Take the test when you're young, and you get high
scores much easier. The 'sweet spot' is early teens (13/14) I believe,
quite clearly proving the ridiculousness of using it as a boast.

It's like my experiences with Bingo.

I've only ever been to Bingo once in my life. I won 200UKP (300 US) from
a 10UKP (15 US) stake. I've never been back since. Does that mean Bingo
is a 2000% investment strategy? Of course not. 

I do an IQ test and get a ridiculously high score of 186. Am I gonna
have it tested again? Hell no. It's only a bit of fun. Even if it was
confirmed repeatedly by 20 tests to be in the 180-190 range, who the
hell cares anyway. IQ tests are just a bit of fun, and 'after dinner'
conversation.
