The named mobs are usually tougher than their normal brethren, you might 
have trouble at 43.  It is easily possible to xp up to 60 in SD, just 
depends where you go in the zone.  Without a tracker, you will have a 
really difficult time locating the named mobs, as at least some of them are 
roamers.  I would check the bazaar first for any of the items you need.  
After that, Shadowhaven and bazaar merchants.
