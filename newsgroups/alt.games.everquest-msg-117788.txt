Were you swinging and missing or not swinging at all?  A couple months ago I
had a bug where I would hit autoattack but I wouldn't swing at the mob.
Apparently the game engine thought I was in the middle of casting a spell.
Sometimes it would recover on its own, but camping and coming back always
solved the problem.  Haven't had that problem for awhile now.
