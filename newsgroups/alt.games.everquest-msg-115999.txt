Success breeds contempt.

Bill Gates has given away a staggering amount of money to charity. He
(and his company) have done more for personal computing than anyone
else. The "standaradization" that Windows has forced upon the industry
has brought about the quantum leaps in technology and software we have
today. No other industry has advanced as far and as fast as personal
computing in the last 2 decades, and most of that can be attributed to
the success of Microsoft. The fact that you can build a state of the
art PC for under $2000.00 is testament to that fact. 

MS is a big business, and they have all of the faults of a big
business. Why does this make them more (or BG) "evil" than everyone
else. They are much kinder and benevolent than the oil companies who
raise pump prices when an Arab sneezes in the middle-east, and ALWAYS
post profits no matter what the overall US economy is doing. They do
not cover-up dangerous tire problems to protect thier sales of SUVs.
No one has ever been killed by a PC crashing.

The constant bashing of Bill Gates is getting old. He is the ultimate
example of the American dream, and the power of a capatalistic system.
All of the bashing is driven by jealousy.
