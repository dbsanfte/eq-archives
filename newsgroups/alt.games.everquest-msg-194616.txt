      As long as any of your Specialize skills are still 0, the rest
are capped at 50.  As soon as your skill in each of them is above 0,
they all unlock until one of them reaches 51.  Then the rest get
locked at 50 again, forever, and the one that went over first can go
up to 200 (or maybe it's 250).
