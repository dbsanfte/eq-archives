1. A SoW is Spirit of Wolf.  It makes you run faster and most people are 
addicted to it.  Never never EVER beg for it (or anything else, for that 
matter).

2. A better idea than approaching people individually would to send out a 
couple of shouts a few minutes apart explaining what happened and asking 
if anyone could drag your body away from the bandits.  They won't aggro 
on anything too high-level for them so the person could walk in and bring 
your body farther away so you could loot it safely.  Just type /consent 
<person> when they agree to help you.  

3. What zone was the bandit camp in?  If it was a higher level zone I 
know some people who won't help newbies because lots of them are twinks 
who get abusive when they get in over their heads and expect high levels 
to drop everything and help them out.  Then again, you could have run 
into 3 jerks in a row. :)
