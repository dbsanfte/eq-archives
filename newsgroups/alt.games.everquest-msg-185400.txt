On my server you can sell silks for about 1 pp ea before you finish
typing "spider silks for sale 1pp ea"  so that's 20 pp a stack instant
profit.  I've seen them go for as much as 5 pp a silk, which is more
likely the more pre-tailoring you do on them, 2 silks = 1 thread, 2
threads = 1 patch, etc (IIRC, I don't do tailoring myself).  So if you
are willing to set up in the bazaar, do the low end tailoring to make
them more usefull and wait a couple weeks (afk) you could sell a stack
for 100 pp...  If you are really willing to take the time you can set up
in the bazaar and buy low (silks) sell high (make em into padding IIRC)
on them and make a fortune in a hurry, or better yet go hunt them and
buy reall low off of all your competition and make a real killing.  I
don't have the patience for that however, I like kill'n stuff.
