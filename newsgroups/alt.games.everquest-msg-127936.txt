Last night, I was playing Diablo 2 on-line with some friends.
Everything was fine for about two hours, but then my connection 
started having major problems.  I lost my connection half a dozen
times (the modem physically lost carrier), and when I did manage  
to stay connected, I often experienced huge lag.  (At least, I'm 
assuming it was lag.  My character could still move around the 
screen, but anything requring a server response -- monster movements,
picking up items, NPC interaction -- came to a halt.)  Usually the   
lag would clear up after thirty seconds or so.  During these times,
the send/receive lights on the modem were almost completely dark,
with just a few brief flickers.   
 
After half an hour or so of this, I got the hint and quit playing
Diablo 2.  Out of curiosity, I then started playing Everquest, and 
everything was fine!  I stayed connected the whole time.  Well, I   
wasn't really *playing* -- my character just sat there while I 
worked out my frustrations with some housecleaning.  So I guess
there wasn't nearly as much data traffic as there had been while I
was playing Diablo 2.  But I'd glance at the screen every so often,
and all seemed to be well.
 
What could be the difference?  Does D2 use a different kind of
connection than Everquest does?  Is EQ more tolerant of a bad
connection?  Or was it just the low level of data traffic while I
was "playing" EQ?

My system is an Athlon 1800+, 512 MB RAM, and a USR 56k modem.
I dial in to a local ISP.
