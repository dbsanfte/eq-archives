Well, caught the 3:45 flight to the Nexus and finally set foot in the
bazaar.  Impressions:

1) It's a buyer's market.  Bought a Netherbain Chitin, 2 Acrylia Studded
Wristbands, a Spider Fang Collar, and Tribal War Mask for my SK ... spent
about 230p.

2) It's a bad time to be a jeweler ... seems like lots of folks are emptying
their vaults of old rings.

3) Do folks just have to have pets/familiars/warders in the Bazaar? As if
the framerate isn't bad enough ....

4) Heaven forbid you actually need to find someone.  I had a hard time
finding specific vendors ... and that was using track.  There has to be an
easier way, I just don't know what it is.
