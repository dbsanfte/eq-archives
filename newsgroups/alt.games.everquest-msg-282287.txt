Lost something as far as I'm concerned.

I used to solo my cleric a lot, back in the day, because I was playing 
EQ while playing "house husband", and downtime meant I could go do a 
chore of one sort or another (load half the dishwasher, move clothes 
from washer to dryer, etc.) and come back just as I reached FM (or 
shortly after, no biggie if I was sitting full for a little bit, after 
all) and repeat.

Stretch out my kills while keeping the same "kills per hour", but no 
down time, and I'd kill that ability.

More, since my "play" time had no downtime (during the downtimes I 
wasn't playing), I had twice as many kills per hour played as someone 
who was killing slower!

In groups, downtime meant chatting time.  Playing a MMOG (and EQ was my 
first) meant actually having people playing with me... like back in my 
PnP days, as opposed to the standard single player CRGs I ended up 
playing because getting a tabletop group together that could work around 
my crazy life as a business owner and home schooling father.  A "good 
group" where everyone is flatout busy all the time isn't nearly as 
conducive to chatter as one where we kill a few, then sit and rest back 
up, then go again.

So, solo -or- grouped, I liked downtime.  Now I do think the original EQ 
had a bit too much downtime, particularly as you leveled up, but I also 
think they went too far in the opposite direction, and further that the 
fetish players developed against downtime exacerbated this effect.
