And while I've never played a pet class, might I pitch in a request for TB to
add the answers to this question to the FAQ? (Or is it already in there? I
haven't read it in a while myself.) Over the relatively short seven or so
months I've been reading this group, I dare say I see this one asked (and
answered) more than almost any other.
(Well, aside from Druids Suck/Druids Rule questions/threads/flame wars that
is.)
