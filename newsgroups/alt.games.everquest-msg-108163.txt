Ahh, a current appie/guide or ex-appie/guide.  Nice to see you.  However,
lets get back to the topic at hand here.  The actions you speak of are that
of the P-E-R-S-O-N.  NOT, the Fungi.  You speak of the Fungi Tunic as being
some demonic outfit, that once placed upon a person they turn into Satan.

Now, I wont even TRY to say those P-E-O-P-L-E (hence, NOT Fungi Tunic) that
you speak aren't morons, they ARE.  More so the comment (and unfortunate
reality due to stupid P-E-O-P-L-E) concerning taking on too high of mobs.  I
for one and MANY people I know DONT do that stupid non-productive (not to
mention it sorta DEFEATS the purpose) behavior.  Again though Ben, its the
PEOPLE.  Stop blaming the item, why punish us RESPONSIBLE persons for idiots
actions?  Is it because you dont own a Fungi yourself? <shrug> Who knows, I
honestly dont care, because, afterall, an item a person has is NO MEASURE of
the TYPE of person they are.... however, the fact you wish for the Fungi to
be nerfed because of what some idiots have done who just so happened to have
a fungi (I've seen my fair share WITHOUT a Fungi let alone ANY twinkage)
puts you in a similiar category as those people that will train newbies,
monopolizing, etc.  Think about it.

Errm, no.  Now you wish to throw names around.  Open an ear Benny boy, I
will break it down big bird style for ya.

Most of the times I have died with a Fungi were due to adds, adds USUALLY
brought to me by idiots like YOU, whom are jealous that I can SOLO or just
by newbies who dont know how to pull PERIOD.  I didnt just get in a king
group, get my fungi and NOT know how to play the game.  Walk a mile in my
shoes then judge me as a PERSON.  But, dont stoop down to the level of
blaming an item within the game.

Great, you have different goals and what I wrote which is quoted above
doesnt apply.  Again, you enjoy the game the way YOU want to, its YOUR
money.  See the problem is here you assume, which makes you an ass, plain
and simple.  Just because I own a Fungi doesnt mean I or my guild KS'es
Ragefire or "mafiaing" ANYONE.   Just because someone doesnt own a level 60
character doesnt make them any less of a person.  The pure fact that you
would insinuate that I was implying such a thing makes you even more an ass.
In my three years I have probably given out more advice that I can think of
and given atleast 100k in NEWBIE items (though which would still "twink" the
receiver a bit, as far as that single item is concerned) if not more.  As
for the mindless leveling.... errm, who's to say I didnt level aside of some
people that I can call great friends to this day?   You dont think I just
made level 60 and got invited by total strangers to do things like King do
ya?

Besides, if the only thing that matters to you (if I understand your above
statement correctly) is having fun and growing friendships, then perhaps you
could stop being one of those that want to shit on other peoples parades.
Just a thought. <shrug>

Um, ahh huh.  See, Benny, I have will power, perhaps you will over time
yourself.  Its just a simple fact that when the day comes, after ALL this
time, that they DO nerf the Fungi, it will have become much more apparent
that VI/SOE cares not of their loyal and long running subscribers and rather
those whining twits who usually leave within a year.  I assure you, there
will be no petition sent.

I obviously struck a nerve with my post.  It's also obvious that you took it
personal because the plain facts that I have aforementioned apply to you.
Sad :(
