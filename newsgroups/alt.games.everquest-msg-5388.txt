LOL

This is rich.

Let me get this straight, folks.  Someone comes into the newsgroup and
pisses you off, so you run to his ISP and have his service revoked?  This is
<too> fucking funny.  I hear so much about "maturity" here, but at the same
time, something as childish as "go tell his mom" is running rampant.

I can hear it now.

"*sniff*  Excuse me, Mr. ISP, but your paying customer, Joe_Dickhead posted
some mean words on a public newsgroup.  See, I don't have a life, so I'm
forced to spend every waking moment there, and the last thing I want to see
is a bunch of stuff that's going to get my blood pressure rising.  The last
thing I read by Joe_Dickhead got me so worked up that my asthma kicked in,
but I didn't realize I had run out of inhalant, so I had to hyperventilate
into a paper bag.  I'd like it if you could see your way clear to tell your
customer that he's a bad person, take the account he pays for away and
confine him to his room for the night without supper.

Thank you,

Neo_Maxi_Zoon_Dweebie"

You people should quit running around like a bunch of 9-year old prisses and
grow some skin.  This is a make-believe world.  And as much as I hate to
take the air out of your little red balloons, it was mommy and daddy who put
the money under your pillows, and not the Tooth Fairy.
