If you have gone in to the game and created your characters, your
license is non transferable.  You cannot legally sell your account to
another party.  This is the whole point of the End User License
agreement (EULA) you click ok on each time you start EQ.  There ARE
ways to transfer your account to another player but they are not
technically legal.  Do so at your own peril.

If you havent registered yet, you are more than free to return the
game to where you bought it if they will accept returns or sell the
whole kit and kaboodle to another potential player, who must register
before they can play.
