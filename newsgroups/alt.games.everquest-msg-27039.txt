This is true.
Greater Heal from druid/shaman is 270, cleric is 300.  Clerics
maintain this advantage for all their shared healing lines.

>Third, you will get much better healing spells in the long run.  

Yeah, complete heal.
Hard for a level 60 druid to compete with a level 39 cleric when the
target of your heals is a 5900hps ogre warrior...or a 10,000+hps
charmed giant.
