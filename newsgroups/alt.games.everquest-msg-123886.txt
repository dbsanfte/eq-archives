Hehe, my enchanter gets that one all the time when I run around in wolf
form.. Or better yet, on Tarew Marr I was known as the 'Moving Tree' in
Oasis for a couple months back in the day.  Would go tree form on my chanter
and just run around casting clarity (yes, you can actually run around as a
tree, but only chanters, and only if you can have someone sow you at the
right time).  My shaman gets asked for ports a lot, I can't even begin to
fathom why, he's a barbarian..
