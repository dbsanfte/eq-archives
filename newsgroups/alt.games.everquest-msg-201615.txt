I'm afraid I can't help you, except to say that what you write is how I've
heard it described to me.  I intend to try to camp that bugger to get
myself a belt as well, so I'll be VERY interested to hear what others say.

Did you fight your way to the spawn area, or were you able to do the "move
fast and camp to lose aggro at one point" trick? Some say that works after
pathing changes, some say it doesn't any more.
