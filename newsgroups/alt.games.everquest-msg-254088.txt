It's unlikely you can keep more than 2 weapon skills at/near max
until your 30s, so don't worry about it as long as you have a 1H
and a 2H (and don't worry about the 2H until level 10 when you
get past the first damage cap).

Bash is a very important skill, it does only tiny damage, but it
can interrupt spellcasting and also briefly stun your opponent.
The stun effect is most likely to work from behind, which can be
helpful when chasing a fleeing opponent.

Sometime before level 12 or so you want to acquire a magic weapon
and a magic shield.  Willowisps (good source of lowbie loot) and
many undead (as well as lots of other monsters) cannot be hit
except by magic weapons (magic shield to Bash them).

Bows used to be useful to Paladins for pulling until L30, but since
the Luclin expansion, where we got a low mana cost level 9 stun
spell (Cease) they've been pretty near useless.  Your Archery skill
is capped at 75, the level cap at L14, and can never increase beyond
that.  Paladin archery is meaningless for damage beyond L20, and it
isn't worth much before then.  By the time you're 50 you can't even
hit anything worth fighting with a bow once in twenty shots.  There
are some very nice and very cheap items you can place in your range
slot rather than a bow, the Goranga Idol, for instance is easily
available to you through the bazaar at a price you can afford by the
time you're in your teens, if not much earlier.

An excellent resource for starting Paladins is at:

Good luck, good hunting, and don't take any guff from the dorfs!
(beer, OTOH, is always good)
