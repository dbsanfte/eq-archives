Yeah, but the trouble is that prison life is getting downright cushy.  It
costs more to maintain a single prisoner for a year than I make in that
year.  They've got cable TV, weight rooms, good food, etc.  Conditions in
jail are often better than outside.  Hell, you could even say the key to
easy street is to get sent up for life.
