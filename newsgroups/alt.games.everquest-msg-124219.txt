Urm, I did answer you that ;) Thats what the thread was about. Trouble
reading?

I didn't take the small bus to school though. I never went to school. I
learnt to type while being beaten by a small tribe of burmese monks
(Actually wandering chimpanzees in monk robes, but nevermind).

How do you brag dumbass? I'm so confused....

Love and Hugs,
