New drug could help treat MS and Crohn's

A new type of experimental drug appears promising for treating two =
devastating illnesses caused by the immune system attacking parts of the =
body: multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease.

The drug, called Antegren, significantly reduced the number of new brain =
lesions and relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis, and improved =
the conditions of patients with Crohn's, an intestinal disease, =
according to two new studies published together today.

Probably has more of a chance of causing these diseases than a placebo.

MASSACHUSETTS

Lab accused of coverup in missile-defense studies

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is looking into accusations =
that its premier laboratory lied to cover up serious problems with the =
technology at the heart of the administration's proposed missile-defense =
system.

The university was prodded to act by Theodore Postol, a tenured MIT =
physicist in security studies and a critic of the anti-missile plan.

In letters to Congress, he has said MIT appeared to be hiding evidence =
of serious flaws in the nation's main anti-missile weapon, a =
ground-based rocket meant to destroy enemy warheads by impact.

What a noble act of truth and honesty, oh let's give him the nobel =
prize.=20

WEST VIRGINIA

Surgeons protesting high cost of insurance

Almost all surgeries were canceled at four West Virginia hospitals, =
beginning Wednesday, as more than two dozen surgeons began a protest of =
the high cost of malpractice insurance.

The West Virginia surgeons complain that their state has done too little =
to address their rising insurance costs. Their protest was in the form =
of leaves of absence.

What is the hippocratic oath? Something to set your decanter of fine =
brandy upon as you sit in the yacht club with your luciferian order and =
laugh at all the people who died because they didn't get some piddling =
operation?

FLORIDA

Tennessee Sen. Frist aids victims after car rollover

Incoming Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist stopped minutes after a car =
accident on a Florida highway Wednesday, helping tend to the four =
survivors until paramedics arrived.

Frist, a surgeon, was about 35 miles from Miami and heading to a family =
vacation home when a sport-utility vehicle rolled over, throwing out all =
six passengers. The senator helped paramedics stabilize the victims.

What a hero! That is exceptional behavior, usually someone will try to =
run down the people who have been in an accident. I guess I'll vote for =
whatever he is running for next election. We need an ethical take-action =
kind of guy like that.
