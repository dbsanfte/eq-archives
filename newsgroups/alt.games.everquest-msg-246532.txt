The places we all already know. 

But you'll have to knock $800 off of the price, idiot. ;)
65 druids with 438 AA are only at around $200 plus. You got in some
crazy time machine and went back to everquest prices of a few years
ago. You don't have anywhere near that 438 aa either. Plus thts
character is on a pvp server, HA.

Its pretty sad really, the average price for a 65 with lots of AA
seems to be 100 bucks. So it roughly translates to you having earned
about 20 cents an hour for the time spent in game.

I'm only seeing a few characters above 200 bucks and they look like
people have purposefully bid them up, who have 0 or -2 feedback, to
mess up the auctions.
Looks like you might have to get a job to pay your rent and debt after
all, HA!
