Um, OK, odd question here.  How is there a 'stereotypical' legends person 
where there aren't any legends people at all?  The two or three people 
I've seen posting that they are switching over have seemed like pretty 
decent types to me.  It's all the people frothing at the mouth about the 
nerve of Verant to try such a thing that worry me.
