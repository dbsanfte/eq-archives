I was just wondering how level on the test server as I have played on other
test servers (other games) but not on the EQ one. Is it just standard old
leveling as per normal servers, increased experience per kill or are there
text commands/NPCs that set you level or what have you?

I have a level 10 Wizard and a Level 10 Enchatnter on Stormhammer and I
wanted to decide which one to concentrate on and continue leveling. If I
could have a "test drive" of these characters at say level 20 - 30 or so it
would healp a real lot as I often get stuck in a rut on characters
approaching 30 or just after. Is it this possible to use test this way or is
it just as difficult to level on test as regular servers?

I want to keep going with my bard too so don't want to spend all my time
levelling up both characters just to see which one suits my playstyle the
best.
