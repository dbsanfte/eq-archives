Yes, but the DMCA makes it illegal to even try to circumvent the copy 
protections. Previously, one could get around copy protection (burn a 
second copy of a piece of software, for example) and be protected under 
Fair Use. Now, the DMCA effectively neuters Fair Use, which certainly was 
not what it was intended to do.
