You are right of course. Grouping beats soloing for experience
gaining. The classes are set up so that the weaknesses of one
class are set off by the strengths of another class.
However, you need 2 things when in a group to really crank.

1. You need a 'good' group.
2. You need the 'right' place with the 'right' mobs.

'Good' is subjective but we all have been in both good and
bad groups.

The 'right' place can mean you are in a dungeon with lots
of dangerous mobs to fight, if something goes wrong many
deaths and time wasted to recover the corpses may occur.

The main thing a group does is concentrate the efforts of
6 people on 1 mob. This kills the mob fast and makes for
very little downtime so that more mobs can be killed faster.
