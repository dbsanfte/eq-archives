Considering some of the bugs EQ has, I'd not be surprised.  Things like
"Gee...that's not a gating mob...why did it just disappear?" and "I died in
this room...why isn't my corpse here?" are a lot less annoying when someone
in the group has ShowEQ. :-)

I sure could have used it in Kurn's Tower the other day, so I could have
avoided standing on the spots on the first floor that were right over
Burynai in the basement...those buggers can aggro through floor, and then
they warp up right on top of you when you are in the middle of fighting the
first floor mobs you were pulling.  I would have loved to have someone tell
me "don't stand there...it's right over a Burynai".
