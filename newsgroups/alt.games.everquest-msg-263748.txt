You know the item that gates you to OT.  Well not sure if this would work on
a blue server but I got stuck in PoTime fooling around one day and after
thinking for a bit i had no way out.  After yelling to guild and a few
friends one told me to get to the graveyard which i did.  Then he told me to
click on a dead body and get into melee range, which i did.  Then he said
"hammer away".  I did and in about 10 seconds I zoned into OT.  Was
interestingly funny.  Well hope it helps someone that didn't know about it.
Take care
