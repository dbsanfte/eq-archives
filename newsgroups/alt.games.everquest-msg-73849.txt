There already exists a "direct relationship...between accomplishment
and access to equipment".

Every "Fungi Tunic" being worn by a low level twink was aquired by
higher level characters taking a risk and reaping that reward (ie
killing the mob and looting the item)

All of the "Uber Items" in the game were aquired by people strong
enough to claim them. What they do with those items is up to them. We
all pay our monthly fee, and we all have a right to play the way we
want as long as it doesn't violate any rules or policies.

Cheers
