So it is a faction issue then? I wasn't so sure as someone in my guild
came up with the idea it could be based on level difference. Though I
don't know why a mob should not aggro on a green pet when one of its
buddies is pulled.

I'm trying to make my point more clear. If I remember correctly pets are
set on beta neutral faction. This was deliberatily done to avoid trouble
when pets were going all over the zone due to bad pathing. So now they
can run everywhere and don't aggro anything.
If I'm still right to assume that exactly this faction issue is what
avoids the social aggro then I'm thinking this could be interpreted as
an exploit.
The thing that bothers me with this pulling method is that it defies 
scripted events which rely on adds.
It's just a whim of me to fight honorable. :) And just circumvent aggro
rules strikes me as not so honorable. Or to name it - as an exploit.
