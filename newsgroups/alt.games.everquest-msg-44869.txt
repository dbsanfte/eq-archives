With most skills, it is very hard to raise them prior to level 9 or
10, then they start shooting up quickly.  Keep going toe to toe with
those low level blues and you should see your skill go up fairly soon.
 With any melee class, your melee skills will get to the max (based on
your level) with little problem.  Deleting your character and
restarting will only cause you to go thru the same issues again.

One last thing, you have put at least one or two points in each skill
you are trying to raise, right?

As a side note, melee have an easy time raising these melee skills. 
Think how hard it is for the casters to keep defense up.  I have a
level 39 druid that I want to get my defense maxed out because each
skillup in defense equals 2.5AC.  I am currently at 160ish in defense,
so bringing it to 200 would add approximately 100AC...  WOW!  This is
something that casters often forget about, but can be the difference
between life and death.
