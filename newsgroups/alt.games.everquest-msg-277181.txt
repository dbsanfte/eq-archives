For soloing nongreens, it is pretty useless.  For doing an AOE group it 
is invaluable.  For certain raid targets, that type of spell is 
invaluable.  As I recall, you are primarilly a soloer, in which case, 
about the only use this type of spell will have for you in the long run 
is for farming green mobs.
