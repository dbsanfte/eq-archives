A common problem among big guilds . Big guilds need clerics . No one really
wants to play the cleric. If you are a cleric you will be guildinvited and
rewarded as a valuable member even if you would not be particularly valuable
playing any other class.

They wanted your cleric nothing else. You want something else other than
your cleric. Dosent sound like that could have had a reconcillation of any
type.Probably best that you left them . They will most likely hold it
against you forever :)
