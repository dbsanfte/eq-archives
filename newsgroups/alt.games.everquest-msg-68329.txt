	Maybe Warriors in munchkin-guild gear, but I was getting smacked around
decently.  I could solo a Timeless Golem with nominal downtime, or a Shissar
Stalker if I rotted it a bit first.  The undead Iksar were hitting for around
150, way too quickly.

	The AE groups had to be stopped but from all reports they went way
overboard.  Reports are that all mobs are immune to movement changes, all mobs
run at SoW speed or higher, increased resists, increased HP, increased attack
speed and increased damage.  All they really needed was to make the mobs
unstunnable and maybe increase resists.

|    AoE groups are very high-risk.

	Oh, no they're not.  If you're making more EP than you lose on average,
it's not high-risk.

|    Now look at the changes to The Grey. The changes specifically made the
|zone near-unsoloable by any INT caster due to the massive resists on the
|mobs now, in the name of promoting "balanced groups" - the exact group
|composition that the solo INT casters cannot get into because they aren't
|"good enough" compared with a melee. VI took one of the few zones where
|these folks felt powerful and useful, and destroyed it for them.

	They destroyed it for everyone.  I don't expect to be able to fight there
any more myself.
