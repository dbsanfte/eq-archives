You give ring first, then he gives gold and rapier (btw, plat works also).
Although there is the odd chance that someone was being an ass and gave
hasten the gold and/or rapier and you will end up with the boots, but
there's really not a lot you can do about that, just accept that it is a
possibility unless you are waiting there for hasten to spawn.
