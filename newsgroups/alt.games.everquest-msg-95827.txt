I post this to all groups because I don't know where this thread came from;
followup-to poster.

You're also naive about Usenet inner workings :)

rgcm is not a moderated group. 

On moderated groups, posts are first sent to a moderator by email, and he
can decide whether to post it or not. In that case what you propose is
possible, pretty common (although rejected posts are almost always checked
by humans) and called robomoderation. Moderation is always a bit
controversial, robomoderation doubly so.

Actually, your proposal is far too strong, removing posts if they *don't*
have the right keywords. It's very easy to write a good on-topic post
without mentioning any of them, unless you include so many keywords as to
make the list useless. For a good system, you *never* want to throw away
legitimate posts as it's worse than the gain.

But that doesn't matter because the chess groups aren't moderated.

On non-moderated groups, there is no central point of insertion. All you
could do is cancel them after they were posted. That's only allowed with
"official spam", and only if you follow some more rules. Something is spam
if it is posted too often (exactly the same post). Do a Google search for
"Breidbart Index". Basically, post something 20 times or more and it's spam.

See http://www.cybernothing.org/faqs/net-abuse-faq.html

None of the things you want to fight are spam. You want to cancel by
content, based on what the posts are about. That is abuse, and will get you
disconnected by your ISP pretty quickly. Only a few recognized spamkillers
should cancel posts whose BI is too high, and otherwise people should only
ever cancel their own posts.

Also, Usenet is not the Internet :-). There are still people who are on
Usenet but not on the Internet; it's just true that most of the Usenet
traffic is nowadays done via the Internet.
