Episodes of "Sesame Street" may soon be brought to you by the letters
H, I and V. Sesame Workshop, the organization that produces the
long-running children's show, says it will introduce an HIV-positive
Muppet character to the cast of its South African program this fall
and is discussing a similar move in the United States. The South
African character hasn't been named or designed yet, but it likely
will be a 5-year-old female and a "monster

And you expect them to comprehend that??

Please don't take this the wrong way, but have you ever been a
parent??  I remember back when my kids were 2..

Well, that answers my above question.  My wife has been a teacher for
going on 15 years now.  Her reaction to the news was similiar to
mine..

There are many many things that are more important to teach kids.

And, even if they could understand the concept of tolerance, there are
MUCH better ways to teach it then to expose them to the sexual
activity that is sometimes responsible for HIV and AIDs

ANY situation?

Why stop there??  

So, you would advocate explaining to them about terrorism, 9/11,
sexual intercourse, sexual predators, etc etc etc...

Why not just let them be kids for a while??

So, why pick HIV and AIDS??

Why not pick something else that has a LOT less controversial
baggage??
