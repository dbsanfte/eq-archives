	War is not a zero-sum game.  Where did you get that from?  It is entirely
possible to have tactical scenarios in which killing any number of the enemy
does not noticeably improve your strategic position (example: Viet Nam), or
wars with ambiguous outcomes (example: World War I, Korea), or wars in which
all sides suffer total defeat (example: any hypothetical nuclear exchange).

	That's the PROBLEM.
