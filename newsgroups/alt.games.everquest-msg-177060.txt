I've been helping out the poor farmers in WK where the bandits have
taken over their farm. There's usually 4 of them there, I can take two
at once so I root one, then strafe run off a fair way, root another,
run off a fair way, then turn and take on the two that are still on
me. Then I wander back and  clean up the remaining two.

I've been doing it quite a lot the last few days, but just now upon
returning to the farm one of the farmers came running at me. I thought
it was a bandit at first, but it was the farmer whom i've been helping
rid of bandits.

Why did he attack me ? Did one of the casters cast something on him
that made him into their allies ?
