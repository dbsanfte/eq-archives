Your group member was correct.  Below level 10, there is a 5 level limit
between high and low levels in a group.  Anyone below that limit will not
get exp.  Starting at level 10, add 50% to the lowest group members level
and round up.  That is the highest level that they can group with and still
gain exp.  So, a level 1 could group with a level 6, 2 with 7... until 9
with 14.  From level 10 the progression is 10/15, 11/17, 12/18, 13/20,
14/21, etc.
