Like  EQ is the REAL world right? A dragon would be the ultimate tank and add a
great deal of class to any group or raid.  Like an ORC is what did yo9u say?
*practical/* How many  orc cities are there anyway?  LOL

And what's so bad about limiting a newbie zone to the races for which it was
designed?  Ever start out a WE druid or  ranger and have to put up with all the
BLs and Dwarfs and Barbs etc   farming Crushbone?

No city?  no big deal. The entire zone can be be consired the *city zone* with
merchants, guildmasters  spread throughout it. It would fit the  dragon
mystique so to speak.

To my mind the game is all about having fun and not being linear- literal. I
mean I get enough of the later in real life don;t you?. LOL.
