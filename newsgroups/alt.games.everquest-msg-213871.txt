It seems to have one hell of a drop out rate.

Ran a human druid up to 36 there over the last month or so. I think I added
about 10 people to my friends list in that time.

Checking them now I get maybe one person on my friends list who plays
occasionally. Most drop out before they hit 10. Some rushed to ~25 with PC,
then drop.

Occasionally you see something cute that makes it worth it. i.e. Was killing
sand giants and spectres in Oasis. This level 19 female halfling druid
starts running up and melee'n the rooted SG, backs off, heals, and goes back
in. Eventually root breaks and she runs up and starts trying to smack it
from behind as it flees. After it drops she bends down<simulated looting?>,
stands back up, says "Your kill".

I thought it was kind of funny. Made me glad I wasn't a typical "MINE!" jerk
anyway so the thing could play out.
