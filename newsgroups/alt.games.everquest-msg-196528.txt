Bards were balanced around twisting (from J.M. Capozzi, early
beta tester - later on production staff for one of the expansions.
He used to post on eq-bards mailing list).  

Also, anyone who uses a mouse to twist is nuts (IMHO) - even
before we got pauses and /cast for social, you were much better
off hotkeying your songs.  It allows you to twist in higher lag
conditions and while blind (among other things).

By making a social for each song slot along the lines of -
/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast #

You end up having to press one button every 3.3 seconds to
twist your songs.

In the early days the song message was that incredibly 
hard to read dark blue, and there was not casting bar for songs.
As a result, you developed a sense of timing for the twist.  I
just left my left hand resting on the top row (where my hot keys
were) and wove with them, which allowed me to move with the
mouse or with the num-pad.  Even after several hours I didn't
get as much fatigue in left hand as I do after several hours
of programming.

The only problem with that setup was that strafe running or circle
strafing was hard to do while twisting.
