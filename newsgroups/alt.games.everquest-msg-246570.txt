	Thanks to the wonder of the Sidekick feature, no you won't!

	Anyone level 11 or over can make a character five levels or more below him 
his Sidekick.  As long as the Sidekick and Mentor stay close, the Sidekick 
will fight as though at a level close to the Mentor's.  You don't suddenly get 
new powers, but you get a boost in hit points and accuracy, and your powers 
function as though you were at the new level.

	If you're both on at once you'll need to find two AGE'ers to group with, one 
to Sidekick each of you, but you can group with higher-level folk just fine.
