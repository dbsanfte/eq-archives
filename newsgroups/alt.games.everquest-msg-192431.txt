No patience for pointless whining? That's a bad thing? Rather than
asking if anyone else has had the issue pop (back?) up, he immediately
takes fire with bitching. I was serious, I haven't had problems with
the Bazaar. He didn't explain if it was a simple LD or boot to
desktop. In the latter case, it's entirely possible that the issue is
partially due to something on his system (Note: Partially). Rather
than asking if anyone knew a solution, he bitches. Hence, I call him a
whiner. Whining is unproductive complaining rather than trying to find
a course of action that might be available to help with the problem.
