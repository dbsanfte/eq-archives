Exactly. (Although, my son did bring up an interesting
visual of ogres and trolls coming to visit me one day
as I stood in the trader stalls to 'persuade' me to go
along with it. LOL )

I didn't relate the specifics as to why I asked the question
in the original post, so I will now. I've been selling an item
that is a tradeskill item for 2 or 3 months now. Everything
needed is available on vendors. The trivials needed to make
it are not in the 200-250 range, but much lower. In the 80-
120 range, IIRC, but it's been quite a while since I've had
to worry about it so I don't remember exactly. There are three
things that make this item more than just a slight inconven-
ience to make. One is that two of the required ingredients
can only be found in one place and it's a little off the
beaten path. Not especially dangerous to get to, more of
an inconvenience than anything else. Two is that it takes
3 combines to make one item. Not a big deal when you're
only talking about making them for your own use. But when
you're talking about making them for sale and you're doing
a hundred or two or three at a time, tripling the combines
becomes a little time-consuming. The third is that the cost
of the ingredients is not trivial. To buy the ingredients
for 100 items, it's approximately 3000plat. Trivial to
some, maybe, but not trivial to a lot of players.

So, here I am. It took me about a month before I was able
to work up enough platinum to keep myself supplied in the
items and also have extra to spend on toys. For the last
month, month and a half, I've been cruising along, selling
the items at the price I'm comfortable with (in terms of
not feeling like I'm gouging folks and in terms of turnover
rate), buying things with the profit and generally very
happy with things.

Yesterday, I logged my trader on, went AFK immediately.
After about half an hour or so, checked back and found
numerous tells from someone who had just started trading
in the item a few days before that (I keep an eye on
who's trading in it and how much they're charging.) The
crux of the tells were that, if I would just start charging
X amount of plat, then everyone selling in the item would
be selling theirs and we all would win. I checked and, other
than a couple of people who have had their items priced
outrageously (IMO) forever and ever and never have changed
them, everyone else had theirs marked at the price mentioned
(which was only 5plat higher than my price, BTW.) I answered
the tells and politely said No, sorry, I'm keeping my price
where it's at. I'm satisfied with the profit and the rate
that it sells. Their reply said that they thought I would
'be cool with it, but, ok then.... Nothing more was said
and, within five minutes, everyone was back to the regular
way of pricing. I.e., one or two pricing at a plat or two
below the price I had it at.

 >I don't talk to anyone about what I should charge, and the

I almost said 'Hey, if you want it at that price, come and
buy the rest of mine (I had about 30 left at that point)
and you can sell them for whatever you want.' But that wouldn't
have been nice because I have about 290 ready for that last
combine and would have been back in the bazaar later on that
night, pricing them at what I always do. Hehe )

I'm in the bazaar a lot and I leave my trader up all night
long. But, I share your 'maximum turnover, not maximum
profit' view of things.

Really? Aw, man, we have it *easy* now. :P
