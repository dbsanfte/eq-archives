Ah yes, heat. To the OP, if you're overclocking...stop. :p That, or
make sure all your cooling fans, etc are good and maybe even grab some
of the CPU cooling utilities out there. (Not sure how good they work
since I don't overclock, but they supposedly lighten the load on the
CPU so it doesn't run so hot)
