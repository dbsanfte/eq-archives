First log was apparently pre-nerf hammer.

Personal experience was with a L56 Cleric, and she had one "lucky
run with procs" after another.  I saw an "... is smashed by the
Hand of the Gods!" message every few seconds she was fighting, and
with the bit of direct melee damage she was doing plus the damage
her pet was doing she was producing consistent substantial damage.
That "nerfed level 56 hammer" procs far FAR more often than any
weapon I have ever seen.  Maybe one fight out of 10 I'll have a
string of procs comparable to that, for part of the fight, the
Cleric hammer was proc'ing like mad all fight long every fight.
I just scanned thru my log of that night, and I could not find a
single gap of more than 11 seconds between procs that didn't
involve her casting or the mob dying.  Typical was 3 to 5 seconds
between procs, the only way "lucky run" makes sense in that context
would be something on the order of 9 procs in 10 blows, which is
gonna do better thann "decent" damage.  [aside:  that proc has got
to have incredibly low agro, if I had a weapon proc'ing like that
you couldn't peel the mob off me with a belt sander.]
