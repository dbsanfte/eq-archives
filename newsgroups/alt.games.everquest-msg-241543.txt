When was that?  I learned that trick doing Fletching in late '99,
IIRC (and man was it an improvement over the alternative).  I
learned it from another player (back in the good old days when you
had conversations with other people in town rather than racing off
to some place where you can bitch about the puller going too slow),
I do not recall it being in a patch message or being talked about
as a patch.  Seemed like just a piece of arcana you had to stumble
on or be told (like many other things back then, spoilers were rare
and very poor in quality).
