It's a nice idea, but probably wouldn't work.  As I understand it,
Verant/Sony is paying for the bandwidth they might use, even when it
isn't being used.  In other words, they are paying to reserve (for
example, this is a much smaller number than they would have) the
bandwidth of 12 T3 lines.  They pay for that regardless of it being
used, they are just paying to have the bandwidth.

Now, add Star Wars.  That game is going to need as much or more BW
than EQ.  They pay for that, even when it isn't being used, plus the
BW for EQ, even if it isn't being used.  Double the cost, basically.
Same income.  Not a good business plan, they'd not see near the
profits they would want.  They almost have to charge an additional 10
a month for Star Wars, as I see it.
