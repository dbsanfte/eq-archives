Three people already answered your question so I'll just add this.

When you go shopping for spells, all the icons look identical...all the
spells LOOK identical.   You can do what one person suggested and
right-click and HOLD down the right button to get a full description (this
works for any item in the game and you'll be doing it quite often during
your life in EQ) or you can simply hold down the ALT key on your keyboard
and the spell NAMES will show.

Before going back & buying your spells I'd recommend you print out your
spell list from one of the many EQ sites that list spells.  My favorite is
http://eq.castersrealm.com.
