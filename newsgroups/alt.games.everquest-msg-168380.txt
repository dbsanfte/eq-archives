Beastlords have stacking mana regen, are excellent damage producers, and can
tank mez two mobs at once.  I'd rather have one beastlord in a group (and even
more so on a raid) than a second member of pretty much any class other than
cleric.  While there are plenty of classes I'd rather have one of than one
beastlord, I think we already have almost every other class represented.

Again, you had the "one of each" mentality I'm suggesting.  One beastlord is
much better than none.  Second beastlord... well its still a pretty good damage
class, if you are keying melee they should be on the list.

Statue of Rallos Zek.  And I'm glad, I've seen some of those talismans and its a
shame to turn them in for mere keys!  Since my item was a useless piece of
statless no drop, there was nothing to be done but turn it into a key.

Aye, we have some people with that key I think.  But its a euro guild, they
stayed up late to try AOW and even later for the CR... while it was mid evening
for me, it was the wee small hours of the night for most of them.  I, on the
other hand, am not one to wait with something half done, I'd have hired a rogue
if necessary!... lucky I didn't, because this rogue was the one that suggested
the growth potion.

I asked before going and was told no danger as long as I didn't pass the first
door.  Figured I'd test the key out, and more importantly get it on my keyring,
which means I don't have to carry it around and there's only half as much chance
something will go wrong and I'll lose it.

Aye, it said Kerafyn's Lair when I did a who in zone.  Still, since there's no
other ST currently available, ST strikes me as the shortest way to refer to the
place in the present tense.  I guess we could say KL, but never seen anyone do
that.
