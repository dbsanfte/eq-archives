I play both a Dwarf paladin and cleric, and if you want a good fighter, you
should probably put your points
into Strength and either int or wis. You will need the boost for skills or
they will take FOREVER to go up.
My paladin was pumped up in str and sta and I left the int and wis at their
defaults, and when I took up fletching,
it takes me almost twice as long to go up as the other fletchers I know. I
have a human enchanter that took up
fletching to support my paladin and he seemed to fly up the skill levels,
until he got bored sitting around making
arrows for a dwarf! hehe ;-)
