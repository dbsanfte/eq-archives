I agree a monk should NOT be a tank if verant wants to put an end to Monk
tanking put a cap on how much agro the generate. Who in their right mind
would want a Tank that loses agro the minute you buff or heal the Tank.
Problem would be solved Cleric cast minor healing on Monk mob attacks
Cleric. Monk unable to regain agro Cleric dies. The only problem is that if
the Tank dies and the mob isn't close to death there is a chance of a dead
group. As a Monk I am a puller I bring a mob to the group FD Tank claims
Agro I get up an Fight mob turns on me I FD again. Healer only has to heal
the Tank.
