My opinion is that corpse decays shouldn't take your equipment
with it.  It's too harsh a penalty to pay for failing to loot
your corpse.  Too many things can happen (many out-of-game) that
would prevent you from looting your corpse in time.

A possible solution would be instead of your corpse decaying
after X hours, you and your corpse would be teleported to the
same safe location.  At that point you could safely loot your
corpse.

People would be motivated to avoid this way of recovering
equipment from their corpse since you would have to wait a long
time for your corpse timer to expire.  You could make the penalty
even more severe by doubling the experience loss by allowing your
corpse timer to expire.  Other negative reinforcements to allowing
your corpse timer to expire could be devised to ensure a lack of
abuse.

In a nutshell losing all your equipment due to a decayed corpse
is bad design.
