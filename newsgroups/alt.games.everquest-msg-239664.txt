I've been taking friends through GoD sewer trials lately and I suddenly find
that I have 5 leadership points and really no idea what to spend them on.
Looking at each of the descriptions is interesting, but I'd like to get
insights from those of you that have actually used some of these skills.

Enhanced HP sounds like a no-brainer, everyone wants more hp, right? Well I
heard someone suggest that the amount of boost was laughable and not worth
the cost. Thoughts?

I can see the utility of some of the other utility skills, but again, it's
hard to evaluate the relative values without having had the experience.

Any insights on what are some of the more useful leadership skills in
practice?

Thanks!
