I think that there  was a difference between the event werewolves and
regular ones. My level 8 Shammy could not really participate in the event,
but before I knew what was going on I had her out walking around on the
Tundra and saw several of these werewolves but they did not aggro on me.
Now every other werewolf I have ever encountered (and I have encountered
more than I would ever like to) aggroed me immediately and from very far
away.  Also, during the event, the skellies in the area conned red to me.
Normally they are dark blue.

When I was at 13th level I was attacked by a werewolf in WCommons (I think)
anyway I had been buffed by a high level cleric and had over a thousand hit
points.  I was fighting in a group of three, who were all beating on it and
I was being healed as I went.  The thing still almost killed me until
finally a higher level player stepped in and saved me from certain death.

So anyway, I'm kinda thinking that at 20th level that werewolf will eat you
for lunch.  But then Rangers have a few tricks up their sleeves that I
don't.

Good Luck
