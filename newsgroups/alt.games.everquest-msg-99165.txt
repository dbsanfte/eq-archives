At this point, I don't think it's so much a matter of whether or not it
*bothers* anyone as it is an analysis of how much the game has or hasn't
changed, and how much it may have been simplified. ("dumbed down" if you
will). Plus the difference between effort to make 50 pre and post patch.

Initially all of the VI defenders were pointing out that the only change
would be pre level eleven, and then, only the time for CR's would be
saved. Then we found out that there was *zero* xp loss until 11. But ok,
fine. As has been rightly noted, the total xp to get to level 10 is
miniscule beyond measurement compared to getting to fifty.

But now we see that it's not just to 11. At least if you are doing any
dungeon fighting, it's looking like it's going to take *significantly*
less work to get _at least_ to thirty than everyone who's already done
it. And the total amount of work to get to 30 does begin to comprise a
reasonably noticable percentage of the work to get to fifty.

Now to this we add the question of the hell level "smoothing". If VI was
going to (as the defenders claimed was the case) "keep the amount
required to get to fifty the same, but just smooth it across all
levels", then fine and dandy. But you'd think that *all the levels*
except the hell levels, would then require *more* xp to make up for the
now adjusted hell levels, yes? Not less.

Arolpin's point seems even more valid now. VI has yet to say that it
will take the same amount of work (i.e. kills) to get to fifty. Just
that it will take the same amount of XP. If the adjustment was made by
simply giving you some huge ass modifier in the hell levels for each
kill, then that's a horrid way to "fix" the problem. Between drastically
shortening the curve to get to 30, then massively shortening it in 30,
35, 40, and 45, you have effectively dumbed the game down by a huge
amount. And thus, a lot of the high difficulty challenge that makes EQ
so addictively and continually successful has been downgraded.

Will people keep playing? Surely so. But it's a rip-off to everyone
who's already been down that road, and the newcomers won't find it quite
the high effort curve entertainment they'd been told about either.

Of course, the changes are in place, and not likely to go away no matter
what protests come from the player community. But that doesn't mean it's
not a valid topic for discussion in this forum, not to mention being
some good mile markers to watch for further "enhancements" from VI down
the road that may truly turn it into PacMan for PC someday.
