	You must be misremembering.  I don't think necromancers get any
kind of a heal until 45 or 46, and then it's like a 200 point life
transfer kind of thing...  They can heal themselves pretty well of course.

	I've never duoed my necro with a warrior but I've duoed my warrior
with a necro.  The warrior plays pet: sets up for dps, then follows the
kited mob around and smacks it.  I even had a hot button to say "attacking
a %t master"...  The warrior didn't need heals anymore than any pet would...
