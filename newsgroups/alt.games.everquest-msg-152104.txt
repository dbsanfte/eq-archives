    If his server is like mine, it's the hallway between your UZO and Disco
area. Everything past that little bridge, until you get to the doorway into
the Disco area. It used to be a fair camp for weaker groups back in the day,
and these days the same level of group or a strong duo will sometimes claim
it.

    For us the "traditional" division over on that side was Chef, Arm/Bar,
and Nec Jail (the area with the Iksar Necromancers in cells). These days
Chef usually takes Bar as well, and Nec Jail will take Arm. Our server never
really had a lot of people camping UZO (they're regarded as weenies), so
there's usually a good deal of overflow room for camps like NG and NJ to
pull from.

    I'd assume that the Jail (or as we call it, IJ for "Ilis Jail") group
sets up where they come out of the water, and pull frogs. The UGP group
would set up in the portal room, and pull mostly shrooms. On my server the
tradition is to set up in the little room that's kinda across from the
portal room, and pull all frogs and the odd shroom as time permits.

    I've seen people in the past call Tola/Prot and Juggs as separate camps.
Today because of the XP usually one uberguild group will set up and clean
all of Juggs, but in the past the group at the front of Juggs also did some
Shrooms to pick up the slack.
