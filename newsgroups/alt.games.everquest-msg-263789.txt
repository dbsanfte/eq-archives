I can't speak about Julie's intent, and neither can you:  only she
can.  

I can, however, say that my perception of it differs from yours, and
that the AGE regulars are making asses of themselves over a very minor

Get over yourselves.  That's not a command, just a suggestion, but
it's one I hope you'll listen to.  You're not normally an ass, and I
doubt Foxeye or Annie are either.
