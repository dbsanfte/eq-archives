You said that a low level grouping with a higher level caused him
to get slower xp because the high level was taking too much - I
simply demonstrated that you were wrong - with concrete examples.

A 40 grouping with a 48 (Your numbers) is getting the better of
the deal in terms of progress toward the next level per kill - PERIOD.

The examples were simply to double check on the math.

When we used to live in the Hole in our mid-50's, a core group
of 3 of us used to pick up guildies in their 40's and pull
non-stop - This included talented Necros and Druids, and when
asked if they'd rather be out soloing, they were adamant that
this was better XP.  Why?  Because they were getting a High
ZEM, and were seeing the slaughter of many high blue to yellow
mobs per cycle.

The math says characters are better off in groups of higher
levels, and so does my experience.
