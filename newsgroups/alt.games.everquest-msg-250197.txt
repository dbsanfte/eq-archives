How about a better implemented mail quest system? We all know about
deliverying bags of mail for the Anatonican Bard League from major
city to major city for some xp, faction, and some coin.

How about having a mail quest that, say starts in Qeynos, delivers
mail to the merchants in Qeynos Hills, then mail to Surefall Glade,
then to the northern village in West Karanas, then a message to the
Millers, then a message to the guards at the North Karanas bridge to
South Karanas, then a packet to the Centaurs, then mail to the
village(s) in East Karanas then mail to High Keep (as final
destination)? The mail quests can be shortcircuited with the PoK
books, but then the xp reward is much lower.

The xp reward for doing all that running should be fairly substantial
for a low-level (<10) character (half a yellow bubble? more?). Might
be incremental with the largest portion when the circuit if completed.
To make it easy(?) for character races that might be KOS, the mail bag
(no drop, lore, container) serves as a faction adjustment to make them
dubious (assuming they haven't done things to worsen their faction too
much). Upon final delivery the character gets a no rent lore no drop
talisman which gives them dubious faction, assuming they are KOS, so
they can get out.

For low-mid characters (11-20/30), the mail quest can be delivery of
goods and boxes for good but not necessarily super xp.
