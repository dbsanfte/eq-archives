As a ranger I simply camo up and run in under the camo and /corpse the
body out to safety...any ranger of 15th+ will be able to cast it on you if
you can group up with them...I dont know if druids get the spell but I
assume so and at a lower level.

This is the most effective method I know of recovering a body solo. No
good against undead..you need a necro base character for that.
