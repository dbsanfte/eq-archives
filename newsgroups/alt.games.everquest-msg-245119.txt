I think monkly-business was the first board he bought, its certainly when
his name became known to me and other players (people i interface with i
mean). After that he bought the Luclin and Prexus boards, which as my home
server, bought the situation home at an early time.  Amusingly enough, after
he bought the Prexus board, the people left en-mass. He was left with a dead
board as people flocked to the new board.  Even people with no grievance
against Ebay took the stance, it got really stupid. He was deleting threads
talking against the deal, banning the "instigators", even added the new
boards website to the "swear filter" so it turned into http://6$^%(*(^$^""ï¿½W

Sony dropped their links and endorsements of it after Yantis bought it.. but
in recent times, things have changed =/

> What good sites for monks are still out there then?

None..

The other board I talked about is a high end only board (which is currently
closed for new admittance atm too)

Theres a few reasons why.. class boards and channels are notorious for
noobs. Some noobs are really new, friendly and polite. Some are braindead
motherfuckers who ignore the 15 other posts with the same title, and make a
new thread called "Are iksars or Humans better for monks???"

After a while you tire of that shit.. I never read MB back in the day that
no other options existed, just too much shit to wade though and things that
annoy me.   Now we have our more private board.. its more like a retirement
home for (mostly) hardened veterans who want to chat on a flame free, idiot
free board and channel.
