I don't know about anyone else here, but I'm not going to decide not to play
today because of the number of people online.  I'm not going to hang around
watching the number waiting for it to hit some magical value before I play.
I play on one server, so, guess what, no matter how many people are on, I'm
going to play on that server.  That's where all my friends play.
