I'm sure you would have said the same thing about horses 2 years ago...how
can you say it will never happen...are you on the dev team?

I think it will happen, in fact I'll even go so far to say that I know it
will happen eventually...they will have to add new content to keep the
player base...the MMORPG market will be getting ferocious in the next year
and a half and I would actually be surprised if they don't...a seperate zone
for houses...why not?  We have vendors now (oh wait they don't really work
yet) or will soon....why not houses?
