Ok, I like to solo a lot and at 49 as a Beastlord I find EJ to be one
of the best places around, most mobs are blue to light blue, except
this "Spectral Soldier" that I have bumped into a few times there.
This soldier cons YELLOW to me and he hits (140 - 167 that I saw) a
tad less than a guard in Cabilis would, and he is LOADED with HPs, I
am not kidding. I had a Guildie Ranger 48 with me and we both medded
and had full health as we were tracking this soldier. I had my pet
fully buffed and sent him in to start the melee, then we jumped in.
After healing the pet about 4 times, we made a beeline to the zone as
the Soldier was barely 3/4 health. Thankfully he was root-able as my
friend and I ran to the zone. I mention this because I see no mention
of him on some of the major websites (everlore none, small on eqatlas
only in forums).

The Iksar camps there are a breeze even for 2 ppl, they conned light
blue to me though, blue to my friend. I imagine this being nice XP for
a group in the 30's. Drops in EJ are horrble. I think I got 4 no drop
items from one skele once (fine steel ulak, shiny emerald, and other
junk), not sure if any of these are quest items, anyone know?

Besides that Soldier, I recommend the area to people. The mobs are
high aggro, but some areas seem so sparely populated it makes for easy
hunting. Don't ever think you are safe even near zone areas, but as
long as you keep the perspective view (f9 a few times) on it will
help.

I now port to EJ instead of DL because a lot closer to Cabilis, and
easier to run through this zone to FoB then DL-FM-LOIO, etc. Of course
LEVITATION helps and will cut the run to zone down, as you wont need
to cross the great staircase.

Hope this helps fellow iksars that like to travel or looking for a
place to solo.
