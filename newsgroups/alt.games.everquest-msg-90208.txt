Geforce or any nvidia card really. Nvidia comes out with new drivers
constantly and they still support riva 128, vanta, tnt (i still use a
tnt 16 meg apg in eq.. compare that to what 3dfx or ati people can
still use and play WELL) and every other nvidia card and apparently
will for all time. They even make their own 3d accelerated linux
drivers which come out nearly as often as the reference ones, if you
ever want to multiboot to lilnux. No one comes close to nvidia.

To me performance comes second to rock solid support (even on a card
several years old) but if you get a geforce 3 ti 500 or a geforce 4
4200 or up you'll also perform about as well as any similar cards.

Most people using geforce or tnt or whatever nvidia card in EQ now are
using either the 22.80 drivers or the 21.83 drivers. These are
reference drivers from nvidia but no longer offered on their site in
particular (I think verant has links to the 22.80 from an EQ page and
other older ones can be had from www.guru3d.com)  After they patched
several graphics drivers many nvidia card owners were having trouble
with the newest nvidia drivers at the nvidia site, the 23.11. 

You really can't go wrong very much with a geforce. Personally I'd get
the $199 geforce 4  4200 card which is the baseline GOOD (non mx) one.
Two other ones are higher quality, details are on the nvidia site and
benchmarks are at www.tomshardware.com.

I have no issues in eq currently on a p2 400, tnt 16 meg agp, nvidia
drivers 21.83, all luclin models enabled, 576 meg ram. If you look at
the tech board some people are having trouble who have geforces and
AMD chips but overall people with ATI cards seem to be having the most
problems. Most of these problems seem to be with touchy everquest
graphic drivers and the fact that with 2 different main chips and a
myriad of different motherboards there is now just so much that can
possibly go wrong.
