I'm going to have to apologize for several rude mistakes that Fawnii
has brought upon this newsgroup with their message.  She/He/It isn't
very liked nor appreciated much around the Emarr board community.  The
bugger has retired and quit many times over and all we at Emarr really
have to say is "Can you stop posting, too?"

By the way, I'm serious.  ><
