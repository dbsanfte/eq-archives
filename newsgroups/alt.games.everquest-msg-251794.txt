To the Original Poster:
Go watch TV

 I quit EQ years ago and check it out now and again when they say my
account is free for a month.
Its a great game or was a great game. To big now and no one to group
with. I would keep my account open if it were possible to find a group
now and again.  I played the first 3 years and had a lot of fun
playing. 
What I used to tell people that would say how can you sit there and
play a game for 6 hours. (after work of course)
I would respond how can you sit and watch TV for 8.
The average american watchs 8 hours of TV a day. Personally I find
online gaming far more social and mentally stimulating than friends
reruns or survivor. I always managed to keep up on the news stay
involved with friends and family. Ofcourse I was never in an uberguild
either. Those people would be herione adicts if they were not playing
EQ.
However one interesting fact a friend of mine pointed out to me was
that not only can you play EQ and watch TV at the same time, you can
listen to music, read a book and have sex with your spouse all while
playing EQ.
There have been many a wonderful sex act with the wife while waiting
in the buff line for a naggy raid or breaking into fear. Raid wipe
outs were common back then :). Just dont tell people you werent
taunting  because your wife was under the desk. Hell We even had EQ
parties where the 4 or 5 RL friends I had that played would all be
online and we would group together go fight stuff and do shots. 5 RL
drunk people can make for some serious LGuK trainage. Not to mention
the trouble recovering corpses from a hallway that no one remembers
running down.
 I have quit playing but I still dont like to watch Survivor or
Friends. And everyones and a while (like Now) I hear the game calling
to me and consider playing again. I think i will wait for EQ II.
