Just generic damage.

When not grouped, whoever does the most damage gets all the xp.  (there 
are some exceptions with spells that can erase a mobs memory of who it 
was mad at).

Whoever gets the xp gest looting rights.

There are a lot of factors in all of this, and I don't pretend to know 
them all.

I believe it is your skill in Offense and the weapon in question vs the 
AC of the mob you are hitting.

The amount of xp is based on the level of the mob you kill in general, 
with zone modifiers.  There are also modifiers for being grouped, race, 
and some class bonuses.  In addition, there is a bonus for killing mobs 
that are close in level to you or higher, but, I think that bonus only 
applies at high levels, not sure.  Even in the case of the same mob, 
there can be level variation, and thus, xp variation.
