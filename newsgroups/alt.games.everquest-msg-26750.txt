It's all about your level.  Druids and shaman catch up at
29, with greater healing, however you get a new heal at 34,
and they don't.  There is another similar plateau at a lower
level IIRC as well.  from 29-34 Any healer will do
basically.  but after 34, Clerics Shoot way ahead in the
healing arena.
