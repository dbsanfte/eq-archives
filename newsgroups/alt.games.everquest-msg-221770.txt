Yep, sometimes I will shout a check, but its purely for my
convenience.  And sometimes if I see a check I'll answer it, but
thats purely to save the other guy a long walk; I have the camp
because I have the camp, and if I don't say so and he shows up,
its still mine.  Unless he doesn't want to obey the player
consensus rule and respect that, in which case he can evoke the
SOE "play nice" policy and share the spawn, or can get even
meaner and declare it open season on the camp, with whoever first
damages any given mob getting it, or can get meaner still and
engage any mob he desires and use the hard coded "whoever damages
it more gets the kill" rule.  GM's being an average of 4 hours
away, its mainly social mores that cause any of this, although I
like to think that eventually the bell curve on that average will
get a GM in quick enough to actually witness bad behavior one of
these days for the habitual assholes.
