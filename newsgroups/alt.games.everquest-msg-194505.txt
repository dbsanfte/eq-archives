Lance believes that those forums are worthless and full of people that have 
no clue of what they are talking about (as he has noted here before), so I 
doubt he will bother to go there.

As to the discussion, I too believe that Run would best be taken before 
Regen, but the argument is there that there is good benefit to taking 
Regen, especially if you are the type of player that almost exclusively 
kites outdoors.
