When I tested the Cancel magic line I found a definite preference for
the buffs nearer the top, as if it's checking them in order and stopping
if/when it scores a hit (or enough hits, in the case of the higher level
spells in that line).  So there is still some advantage to getting your
most important buffs last, and to using junk buffs at the top in hopes
of "using up" the dispel before it reaches the good stuff.
