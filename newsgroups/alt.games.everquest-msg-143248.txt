Nonsense.

You're talking about different laws because someone robs you for money
and another robs you for your Rolex.  After all, their motive is
different, if related.  That's hardly the same as comparing an accidental
death and an intentional one.  One, after all, lacks motive at all.

Any non-biased "hate law" automatically extends to class, correct?
After all, class, even if not something most people care to think
about, is another distinguishing characteristic.  How do you
distinguish a "non-biased" hate crime law from normal, run-of-the-mill,
street crime largely based on class?
