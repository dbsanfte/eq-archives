basically hunting in pog makes u KOS to:

1. all high elven paladin NPCs
2. all high elven cleric NPCs
3. most druid and ranger NPCs that are involved with their epics
4. all mobs on PoG itself

1. and 2. are representatives of tunare herself. so it is understandable
that u get KOS to them when hunting their god and her minions. (i think you
only dont get KOS to all tunare druids when hunting in PoG, since the druid
port system was really important till pop)
3. are basically PoG mobs sent out by tunare to give her followers their
ultimate quest.
4 doesnt need explanation i guess )

all those factions NOT on PoG can be fixed wit the "muffin"-quest. i dont
know of a way to fix your faction ON PoG after you messed it up.
