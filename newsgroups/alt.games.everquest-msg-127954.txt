So I spent a fair amount of time pharming silks in EK
last week, and I was constantly annoyed by a hill
giant trapped under the world.  Unlike the more
standard "under the world" complaint, this guy wasn't
beating on me while being immune to my attacks... no
this was more subtle.

How, you may ask, do I know he was there since he
wasn't attacking?  Well I'd recently finally reached Track
level, and there he was.  Hmm, Two hill giants on track,
both blue to me... time for an EXP break from all these
darn greenie spiders!

Thing is there was no position from which he could be
seen.  And he'd move around on track a bit.  Never targetable.
I can't solo a hill giant, but I -can- solo two... this was pretty
frustrating.

Then later there was a crag spider under there.  OK, the
hills were easy enough to ignore, just give up on exp after
all.  But crags were what I was there for... this rendered
the hard won Track skill almost useless!
