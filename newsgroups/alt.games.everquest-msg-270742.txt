That's not surprising seeing what they did with SWG. SOE has their
deadlines and the *don't* budge an inch. Especially when it comes to beta

listen for a while but during the last few weeks they put their hands over
their ears and do the "La la la la I'm not listening to you" act.

Oh, you hate your job? Why didn't you say so? There's a support group for
that. It's called EVERYBODY, and they meet at the bar.
