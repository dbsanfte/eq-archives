The flaw in your reasoning is that you don't have to "subscribe" to protect
your items. Just cancel your account and sit back and forget about it. If
you decide some time in the future to start playing again, simply activate
your account and you're back in business. I de-activated my EQ account
twice, once for 2 years and once for 8 months. Both times, when I
re-activated everything was just as I left it. As long as that possibility
remains, that someone like me will come back, they will keep my data around.
