I had the same problem which was solved by going back to driver 2.7.4.2. It
was a lag like there was 100 %packet loss but only for an instant. Still it
made me go link dead a lot... nothing like the joy of delevelling because of
some obscure technical incompatibility. Same problem with geforce 2 was
resolved.
