    Only been to the Plane of Hate once before,  with about 30 people.
We had a ton of trouble breaking in,and even after the break-in we had
several whipes from overpulls..

    Last night I was doing some grinding in Plane of Innovation, and got
invited to a Plane of Hate raid.
It turns out, only 6 people were going. 65 war, 62 wizard, 60 druid, 58
rogue, 55 enchanter (me), and 54 cleric.
To me, after my past experiences with hate, I KNOW this is suicide, but
can't resist an adventure..

    Well, we port in, and run to safespot without incident, onlly aggroing a
banshee which is easily dealth with. Then the warrior begins to pull. I
target the warrior with AE memblue before he gets to camp, and we end up
pulling about 3-4 at a time. The warrior shields me while we lock everything
down, and we just mow through the monsters. Its suprisingly easy, stuff is
dropping really fast. Its really hard to put a sizeable dent in that
warrior, and anything not on the warrior is quickly rooted or mezzed.

    At this point, we are getting a little cocky and decide to go after the
Maestro.  We creep close, pacify or lull all his cleric guardians, run back
to safepoint, and the warrior pulled him.. By the time he gets back to camp
hes at 20% health, but only got one add, a loathing lich. Cleric cheals
warrior, catches aggro from maestro and is killed almost instanltly. This is
NOT looking good. I lock down the loathing lich, and start using it as a
mana battery with TOT. The druid seems to be handling heals nicely, I start
to chain rune5 the warrior to protect from lifetap, and try to land a slow,
but it wont stick.

    Maestro at about 33% health and druid calls OOM. Wizard begins chain
nuking, gets summoned and killed. Rogue, low on health from AE lifetap,
catches aggro and begins to get beat on.. I rune5 him and am summoned and
start getting beat on. Mez on lich wears off and starts beting on me as
well. My only thought was "we are all going to die". All of a sudden there
it was, "you gain party experience". With a nice doublebackstab, the maestro
was dead, the lich was remezzed and we won the battle.

    Having never had the pleaseure to go on many raids, and never having
killed any boss monsters but Trakanon, this was the most exciting moment of
my EQ career, accomplishing with one group something I had failed before
with 5.
