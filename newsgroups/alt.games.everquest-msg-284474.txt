OK, now granted its been YEARS since I retired from EQ but unless
they've changed something, or I'm missreading what you mean, that's not
true.

Mezz song has a certain number of "ticks" it lasts, when that is up you
HAVE to remez.  You can reapply mez before the song runs out to keep
things mezzed constantly but you do have to keep applying mez by
selecting the mob and letting the song pulse, switch to a new target,
let song pulse, etc.  Mezzing for bards is a click fest that I always
hated.  :\

Pulling I enjoyed as a bard, I hated acting as CC though.
