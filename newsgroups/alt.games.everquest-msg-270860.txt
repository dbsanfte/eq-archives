I have noticed a serious drop in free buffs in pok the past two
weeks. One guy was insulted I only had 2 plat for a temp buff and
refused to give it. I found someone else later on who would buff
temp for 2 plat. Most want 10-20 plat to cast a temp. My 'toons
rarely have 5 plat all at the same time. I guess my 12th warrior
will have to farm wandering greenbloods so my lower level toons can
afford to get a buff.
