I would say it depends on whether you can get flagged for PoS/PoV or
not and whether you could solo/get groups once in Tier 2.  If you are
in a friendly non raiding guild then I'd reckon flagging will be
utter pickup hell.  Spell wise I like Earthen Roots very much indeed
as it parks stuff I wasn't able to reliably before and for longer
when it does stick, not sure if this applies quite as much to Druids.

PoN yard trash is good through 62 although starts to tail off
seriously at 63, plenty of stuff dark blue all the way to 65 if you
move deeper in however.
