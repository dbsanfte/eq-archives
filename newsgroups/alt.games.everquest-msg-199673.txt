are you trying to say that if one chanter will start bitching if
another chanter dares to sell C3 in "his" zone? if so then fuck em, if
they cant handle free market competition in a video game then they are
ill equipped to handle life itself. they arent the kind of person who
would own their own business. also, some people pay over 100pp for C3,
other pay 14gp. its not really like the free market i guess if you
sell a car for either $25,000 or $1,200 whichever the buyer decides to
give you. or free if the buyer just clicks disband group and drives
off the lot.
