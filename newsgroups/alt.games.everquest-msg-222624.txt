No longer true.  All controlled through the Options gui.

I've had zero problems with 9.0.  /shrug.  It's worth mentioning that 9.0 is
the maximum you can set this to, and may improve performance.

This is a little confusing.  /r will return a tell to the person giving you
a tell.  /rt will target the last person to send you a tell.

Just as an aside, this doesn't always work for me.  I can stop, turn ninety
degrees, cast, and still get an interrupt.  Still a useful tip, though.

Other than those quibbles, good stuff.
