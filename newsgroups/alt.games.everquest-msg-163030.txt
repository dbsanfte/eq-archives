You WILL need your resist gear when your guild are able to kill other 
dragons (ragefire, voushi and so on).
And if you ever wanna go into ToV, you better have good resist gear too. 
No idea how the resist gear affect game on the planes, havent been up 
there much, but for a LOT of places in Norrath and Luclin resist gear 
are VERY needed. In every fight where you cant hide from the AE behind 
something, resist gear play a very big deal.
