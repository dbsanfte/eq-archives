No lawyer would want to argue that in open court, at least no lawyer
that isn't smoking crack. In order to work for money you have to have
the "meeting of the minds". You can't claim that you are to be paid
for time working on someone else's property. That principle is
fundimental to contract law.

You mean besides a pre-paid-legal-services lawyer or something? Name
one greatest legal mind please? Just one who spent billable hours on
this.

There is a caveat. They have to have passed the Bar, in some state, in
the US, and not have been disbarred for getting paid in packets of
glue or free massage coupons at the local asain "stress" therepy
center.

I don't expect to get one serious citation, so it is that easy. One.
Make sure I can check cause you know I will.

Doesn't matter they can pick the state to sue you in. Thats if they
really care about you, they would more care about the houses providing
this cheat, like IGE or Yantis.

Of course they can just kick you off EQ and let you get your crack
team of pre-paid-legal-services lawyers on the case, I know those
guys, fresh from the bottom of the class at the Law School of
Northwestern South Dakota.

Can't work on someone else's property, with the software they own, and
expect renumeration if the contract you have to license that software
forbids it explicitly. It isn't like you are giving up a civil right.

 HAHA thanks for playing.
