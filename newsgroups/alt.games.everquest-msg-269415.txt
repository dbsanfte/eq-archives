Eh, I don't buy that. It may be a metagame but that's not what I (or a
significant amount of others in my opinion) signed on for. It just smacks
of boring and taking the whack-a-mole gameplay to the extreme. Where is the
challenge of going from plains berry bush to sandwashed rock formation?
Granted, if there are baddies nearby you might have a challenge but isn't
that what the killing is for? In my opinion if you're falling back to this
excuse for a game you might as well wrap it up and hit cancel now. JMO
