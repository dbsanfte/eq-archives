I've heard reports from a guy who claims similar problems from trying to 
cancel SWG, but then he was such a brilliant individual he couldn't even 
determine how to recover his lost password. (Which is why he canceled. 
When he called them they wouldn't just say 'oh, mr. smith, here's your 
account name and password, have a nice day. Over the phone they wanted 
the original credit card number and the cd key, both of which he 
couldn't produce. He considers this poor customer service. I consider it 
'Thank you for not handing out my password willy nilly'. This is the 
other reason to never, ever buy an account from someone. All they have 
to do is call Sony with the password and account keys and get it back.)
Personally, if I felt I had done all the cancel things properly, I'd 
call the credit card company and dispute the charge.
