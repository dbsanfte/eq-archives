Again reading this -probably wrong- Prima guide, it says that
collection items are to be found in the chests as well as on
mobs.  If thats true then we might finally have a case where
opening chests up during the run would be worthwhile; I've seen
people complain that they went thru the entire dungeon, killed
every mob and still came up short.  If there are another 5 or 6
of the item scattered about in the chests that nobody opens that
would explain that...
