I haven't had any problems soloing in Kurn's with the two alts I
created.  However none of this matters, since Kurn's pretty much sucks
ass for a level 18 or higher Pally trying to solo.  There may be some
high enough mobs in there to get experience but since they are deep
inside and will usually come with 2 or more adds once you get down in
there...
