Atkins is going great for me so far.
things I noticed recently:

I have this one chair in my house I used to use for
my computer chair but I stopped using it because my
fat rolls would rub against the arm rests and it got really
annoying. Today I sat in that chair to get some files from the
desk it was in front of. OMG my sides didn't rub the arms!!!

I had to toss my favorite pair of elastic shorts, They kept
falling down! :-) Woot!

My umm libido seems to have gotten a boost as well.
Probably from the better eating and exercise. I actually had
to hide an erection from some women I was talking with.
I haven't had to do that in probably 15 years! Hell I would have
started this diet/WOE sooner if I had known this earlier. LOL!
