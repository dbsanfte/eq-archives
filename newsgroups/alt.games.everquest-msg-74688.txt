  I know one thing about shadowed men: they are wicked.  Lots of them
are casters and they run really fast, in addition to just being mean
overall.  Around level 28 with my druid, I was in a group with an
enchanter and a necromancer, and we decided we'd give a shot at the
ones in Lesser Faydark.  I know how to use Harmony and used it to the
very best of my abilities but somehow I still pulled the entire camp
and we got our clocks cleaned (I think it was the pets marching back
and forth that prevented Harmony from doing what it was supposed to,
but I'm not sure).

  That said, maybe if you're careful you could manage to kill the ones
in South Karana.  Maybe it was just the layout of the L. Faydark camp
that gave us difficulties.  I personally wouldn't bother though.  At
level 24 you can solo forest giants in Warsliks for very decent loot
and good experience.

  The sad fact about the Ward Summoned line of spells for druids is
the fact that there really are very few places where they are
practical.  As nice as it would be to get some use out of that
otherwise awesome line of spells, it probably isn't worth it to try
shadowed men.
