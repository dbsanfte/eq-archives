    Just wondering how many people out there left on the old graphics models
for Ogres and Trolls.  I still enjoy the butt scratching comical Ogres.  No
one talks in Ogre-speak anymore.  Guess all those 14 yr. olds out there
don't want to be seen as big ol' belching, farting, armpit smelling Ogres.
They would rather have that pro wrestler look.  It is more appealing to
their mature minds.  And who don't miss those pear-shaped bodied, butt
cracks waving in the breeze trolls.  I still crack up every time one waddles
by.

      So I am curious to what old models everyone left on.  On one of my
computers I left on the old gnomes .  I like the old Mr. Miyagi look (come
on, you know you noticed the likeness).  I still have problems with the new
eraser-heads on the Erudites so I leave them off too.  So does anyone out
there still leave on some of the old models just for atheistic reasons?
