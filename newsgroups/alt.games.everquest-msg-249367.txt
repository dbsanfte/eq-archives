MGB is a luclin era aa. Any ranger who was getting aas that long ago
is likely to have it. Also rangers run out of useful aas at about the
200 mark including GoD aas, therefore any elemental ranger will
probably have picked it up.

The best exp I know of for a soloing ranger in PoP is at tables in
PoF. A kill is 14% of an aa or so. It takes me about eight to nine
minutes to kill one and be ready for the next if I have vallons,
longer if I don't (or thereabouts, I've never timed it exactly, I
should do that tonight). That's about a little over an hour an aa, and
thats under optimal conditions including enchanter haste (not to
mention the ranger has to use alternate means to get OUT of there,
like gate potion, gate hammer, gate neck, two of which take pp to
maintain and the other requiring going to melee range on a mob, just
for the record).

A normal group fighting in PoE can get an aa in about 30-45 minutes
depending on their dps.

Now there may be faster places in GoD for a ranger to solo (if so
someone please tell me!) but under normal circumstances, rangers
simply don't belong in the group you just mentioned. A bard can get 4
aa an hour easy in PoV if the spawns are there. It's no contest.
