I don't know how you can expect the same standard of service from a game 
that cost at most $50. when it was newly released and can probably be 
had for $10. now in the bargain bin vs. a game that cost the same when 
newly released and costs an additional thirteen dollars a month to play. 
The folks who maintain EQ have a steady revenue stream to support 
continued development efforts, the folks at Blizzard don't.

But I know you could argue that it should still work well and I probably 
wouldn't disagree with you. On the other hand, you and I do not have any 
intimate knowledge of what level of effort has been applied to 
Battlenet's problems. I think you are confusing effort with results. 
What you seem to be saying is that you want the cheating gone, period.

This stuff gets to be pretty hard to quantify. Recently when EQ ran a 
special server called Discord for PvP play as a contest the cheating was 
rampant and well known. So Blizzard is not the only one having problems 
and yet SOE has a much larger development budget to operate with to work 
on these sorts of issues.

It's easy from the outside to be critical when you don't have any real 
knowledge of the software engineering problems at hand or the amount of 
work and expense it takes to address them. And again, nobody has 
actually been able to fully address them. In all probability the issues 
at Battlenet are not an easily fixed problem that Blizzard isn't bothing 
with out of disregard for their customers. In all likelihood the 
problems are a lot more complicated than they seem to be or they would 
already have been fixed.

Blizzard puts a lot of effort and time into producing quality 
entertainment. I doubt very much that they then deliberately drop the 
ball after shipping their games out of disregard or scorn for their 
customers. Software engineering problems are a lot more complex and 
expensive to deal with than many people realize.

In the end, I am not saying that the complaints about games that have 
cheating in them are not valid. I am not saying that the companies 
producing online games where cheating exists have no responsibility to 
try and address these problems and improve the play experience for their 
customers either. But what I am saying is that these are highly complex 
and difficult problems to solve and that as such they are quite 
expensive to resolve as well. And I am also saying that usually gamers 
really have no idea what level of effort has been applied to solving 
these problems. They only look at results. And I don't blame people for 
wanting the best possible experience. I do too. But frankly, as of today 
that isn't even possible with online games. The technology has a long 
way to go.
