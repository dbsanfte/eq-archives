Haven't looked at EC since the change.  My prediction come true?
There are sure more people in Bazaar zone constantly than I
ever saw in EC at one time even at its zenith.

Put a bunch of junk on a friends selling bot, logged back
on about four hours later, 3Kpp richer.  From junk.  We
used search to set prices, discarded bottom two prices for
each item and set there, at the low but not bottom price
range for each item we could find already out there.  Other
items I quite arbitrarily priced at 200pp each.  Bargain?
Ripoff?  No idea, these are items that have been sitting on
alts just in case I get something -worth- auctioning and could
throw them in at the same time.  Dunno fair price nor do
I care.  Surprise, most of em sold.

If I'd really believed this day were coming, I'd probably have
10kpp in junk that I"ve sold to vendors despite knowing
what a ripoff that is.

I do think prices might start going up just because everyone is
going to rapidly get a lot more cash (at the high end, anyway) by
selling off lots of junk they wouldn't have bothered with in
the past.  More money in the economy, means less pressure
to sell good items, and that means higher prices (again, on the
good items, that is... the sub 50 gear may stabilize lower because
there will be lots more competition selling it for a set demand
level.)
