 It's part of the Whistling Fist quest. I think Glox is still where he
always is, it's just a clone that you get ported with. A weaker clone
that is since the real Glox isn't exactly soloable. I think anyone can
trigger it if you know the phrase. They should probably level-limit that
somehow.

 Easiest thing to do is probably have a sk/necro summon the corpse.
Either that or try petitioning. Some guides/gms seem to have a weak spot
for that sort of thing.
