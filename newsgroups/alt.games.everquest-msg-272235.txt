You're one of the lucky ones then.  There are several threads on the main 
message boards complaining about this.  Post-big patch, the settings still 
don't save for many (including all 4 of my character slots).  Even worse, 
they've added a NEW bug in to the mix such that if you now create a new chat 
window, the window itself disappears (as in gone, not just invisible) after 
camping.
