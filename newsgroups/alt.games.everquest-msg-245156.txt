Get your stats elsewhere.  Weapons are for hitting.  A lot of monks switch
weapons when they're pulling simply because their fighting weapons don't
give them as much hp.

Knuckle Dusters or Jade Mace (my preference) / Stave of Shielding.  I used
two stave of shielding for a while back when it was a 30k item just because
I fought in Chardok a lot and looted them.  The goranga club is free, but
not nearly as easy to get as it used to be since that zone is often nearly
empty these days.  There are a few other decent options, but probably none
as cheap.

That's about the best damage you're gonna get without dropping a serious
chunk of change.

Might want to look at a tranquil staff after you hit 50.
