You mean like PoP progression? Or maybe GoD progression? If you aren't 
in a fairly heavy raiding guild you are not going do that, period.

There are casual players in raiding guilds that might eventually use 
this content. But there are -tons- of casual players who will -never- be 
able flag the various encounters until they are one groupable or 
soloable because that happens to be the way they regularly play.

Many non-raiding casual players have eaten pretty much all the non-raid 
content they can (or at least all the non-raid content they can reach 
without a raid!) They are just as interested in new expansions as the 
raiders because while its true there is tons of content they haven't 
done, they can't do it, so it might as well not exist for them.
