You're probably talking about the earring of the solstice.  I believe it

I really haven't studied the mage focus effects in much depth, alas.  But 
some of them do stack with other effects and some don't, I hear. :)

I haven't personally tested it.  I believe it's only DoTs that last a 
minimum of 36 seconds... Some have suggested that it will work with slows 
or other debuffs though.

You can look the effect up directly at:
