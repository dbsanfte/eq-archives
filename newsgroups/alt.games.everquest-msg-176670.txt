Hello all,

Well, this is probably not going to be the most popular topic in this
group, but I want some advice on selling Everquest Gold.  My fiancee's
father got us this for Christmas, and we gave it the old college try,
but we just don't have the time to play it, when we vastly prefer
single player games.  So I would like to sell the game to a used game
store.  I contacted Sony Station or whatever to ask them about if
someone else could use the game after I deactivated my account, and
they said, no, my CD-Key was irrevocably bound to me until the end of
time.  Now, this basically implies that if I were to just cancel my
account, keep the game, perhaps move to a new city, change my credit
card, etc., that I then couldn't reactivate my account if I did feel
like playing the game later with the same CDs.

So obviously this seems totally ludicrous to me.  Perhaps I shouldn't
have asked Sony, but in case the store was reluctant to buy the game
off me I wanted to have some official assurance that the next
purchaser could set up a new account.  So I ask this group: is Sony
lying to me?  I see many used copies of Everquest on eBay, so I assume
it must be able to be done (with a game this popular, eBay would know
if selling a used copy was impossible), but perhaps I need to be able
to transfer my account over to someone?  In which case I should
probably just sell it on eBay, but it would be more convenient to just
drive 2 blocks to the video game store.

To boil down the question to its bare essence: if I deactivate my
account, and totally uninstall Everquest from my computer, can I sell
the game to someone else and not have them run into problems with the
CD-keys?  Or are the CD-keys forever tied to my account, and can never
be used again?

Thanks in advance,

The Oneiromancer
