Instead of buying a 7300GS i would try and get a 6600 second hand, as you 
can probably get them for about the same price and the benchmarks ive seen 
for doom3/farcry show it to be about 3-6 times faster.  I havent played EQ2 
for over a year, but there should be the possibilty to join the free isle to 
play before you purchase another month (if you do decide to get the graphics 
card), at least you get to test it out first.
