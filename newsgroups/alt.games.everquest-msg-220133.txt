I have no idea who it was that came up with the idea that "playing God" is 
bad somehow.  But it obviously wasn't an Enchanter. 

Try Hubris!  First one's free. :)

It sucks about your cat dying.  Complications in neutering are rare, but 
they happen, true.  So you gotta figure the odds.  Are bad consequences 
more likely to result from neutering or not neutering?  My money's on not, 
generally speaking.  But it'll always be a wager.  And no amount of 
responsibility is enough to make Life Not Happen.
