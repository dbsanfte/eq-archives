Interesting how when you said something completely incorrect in
another thread, rather than admit it you start a new thread.

For those who may have missed it...

Daylight Savings Time began on March 31, 1918.
FDR became president in 1933 - that's 15 years later, in case you need
a math lesson.

DST as we more-or-less observe it today was enacted in 1966 by LBJ.
That's about 21 years after FDR left office, in case you need another
math lesson.
