  Exactly, that is part of my worry.  I hope the philosophy they are taking
isn't "Oh, well, memory is so cheap and most people have so much of it, we
can go absolutely crazy with our textures and polygon counts and not have to
worry so much about efficiency and optimization."

  RAM may be cheap, but RAM is more like a commodity than your typical
technology item.  Though prices do generally follow a downward trend, my
understanding is the reason RAM is so cheap these days is because the memory
companies have overproduced and now are suffering from an overstocked
inventory.  As they scale down their production so it's more in line with
demand, prices will be back on the rise again.

  I'm not an economics major though, so my analysis might be completely off.
