Never mind not beleiving a level 5 shaman can't bind, how about
getting cursed out because someone doesn't beleive me when I tell them
that my DARK ELF necromancer can't SOW... Or that my VAH SHIR
Beastlord can't port. *sighgrumble* I mean, the level 5 thing at least
requires a /who. It's kinda hard NOT to know someone's a Dark Elf or a
Vah Shir, and by level 40+, one should know that the former doesn't
have any SOWing classes and the latter doesn't have any porters...
