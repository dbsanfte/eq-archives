Or, how about a trade skill or general skill enhancement?

After casting it on myself, I got 2 advances in Sense Heading in the
next 5 clicks.  Of course, that is certainly within the realm of random
chance.  And, I didn't notice a lot of advances in other areas that
could have advanced.

But, Luclin did add items that give bonuses to trade skills (jewelry
making, smithing, etc.).  So, there might be a precedent.
