Learn to read - I said they are "sometimes funny - like monkeys" ...
And I'm sorry, but watching these guys bean themselves in the head
with their own rocks is just fuckin funny, no matter *who* they are,
white, black, Jew, etc.  They do funny things.

But beaning themelves in the head is an effective stragity? Ca-mon
man, your argument is simply a cop-out.  Why *don't* they have an
army ?  There are many crafty ideas to wage battle against the enemy.
Are you *completly* un aware of the Viet Nam war, and the "VC" ???

Nor did the VC in Viet Nam, Italians, Poles, France, or any OTHER
of the access forces that were able to fight Hitler in WWII.

Well, YOU tell ME!  They can't even throw a rock much let alone
defeat an enemy in their own back yard!!  Maybe they need to go
on a field trip to Viet Nam and other places to learn how to be
"crafty" enough to be a formatable force.  Jets? hell, they'd
be crashing into each other (if they actually managed to get them
off the ground).


> have you spoken to each of them and sized them up?

I see what they do as a collective whole - easy to see how they
are individually.


> misled?  by an oppressed arafat or the oppressive forces of isreal?

What does "oppressed" have to do with being crafty, smart, witty,
and able to improvise a formatable offence? (outside of being a cop-out)
Look, there were access power military generals and leaders in WWII
that were out of their element, on foriegn soil, under horable conditions
but YET smart/crafty enough to come up with complex stragities to defeat
the enemy, but yet these Pali's, in thier own homes, on their familiar
soil who can't even throw a rock at the enemy. You *really* think they
stand a chance ??  Hell, they don't ven want to stay alive !! Meanwhile,
military personal in any of the access powers #1 goal was to stay alive
*first*, then work in concert with themselves to wage war against the
enemy.  Whats that tell you about the mentality of the Pali people ??



> the only funny thing here is the bullshit you speak.

That and that Pali beaning himself in the head with his own rock!

All of which are not illegal.  Hey, we deserve it. We work hard (WWII),
and play hard (Western riches).  Advance to some craftyness, and you
too may be afforded the benifits of a more developed race. Its not hard.

You think huh?  Well, sometimes its a dog-eat-dog world.  The Pali's
*know* this, yet they continue to tie pork chops around their necks
to attract the enemy even more!

I have done *all* of the above.  Instead of the slams, why not just
ILLISTRATE some examples of how these Pali's are such a supperior,
crafy, and usefull people??  Show us examples that would lead us to
believe that they are capable of admiring life, rising up to the
challanges of life, and war, and then we may change our mind.

They probably ain't even smart enough to *know* what a land mine
is, much let alone actually effectively *use* them.  Hell, they'd
probably step right on them to tamp down the soil after laying them.

Your sloppy emotions do not go unnoticed.  However, its useless in
your efforts to convince people of your position. Facts talk, BS walks.
