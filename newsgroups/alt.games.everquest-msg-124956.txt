I think there will always be black and white and gray areas in many
arguments. Some in this one, but not many. But let's press on.

Nope. In my opinion, *purely* white. You could equally well (as a good
character) choose to always run back and med in the Monk's guild in
Freeport. Totally safe. Totally not an exploit. I med in non pathing
area's all the time. Not totally safe. If somebody is running for their
fucking lives and pulls a train over me while I'm afk, or the train
paths back over me, my bad. Not theirs.  I hunted in EW near the coldain
outpost until last level. Medded near the Ulthork tree. But on a couple
occasions people trained to the IC bridge zone and the returning mobs
ran over me. I was at keyboard and either killed them or ran away. Not
an exploit. White.

Good strategy. I don't play a fear kiter, but I'd certainly do that as
well. Fight in unpopulated areas. Good tactics.

Nope. Black. Sorry. Bzzzzzzzzzzt.

Mobs never intentionally run into a wall/zone and get stuck there. It's
a bug. Most famous one is the entry to ToFS. If you get caught doing it,
your account spends a few days cooling it's heels on ice. End of story.
Using bugged mob pathing to do damage while taking no risk because of
that bugged pathing is an exploit. Clearly explained by VI on the dev
boards and numerous other places more times than I could mention.

Nope. Also black. Equaly so. Same reason. Exploit.

*sigh*
As VI has maintained all along, the mobs get more of a leg up than any
RL situation because you are fighting with a human brain against FAR
from perfect AI.  This has been covered.

But let's go over the ancient *CLASSIC* example again, Chimp. Why can
mobs ignore the Z-axis? Why can they attack through walls? Because you
are smarter than them. Otherwise you could stand on the bridge over the
gates in Highpass and nuke the guards to level 52. Because otherwise you
could position a non-aggro barbarian in the door of a hut and have your
wizard nuke mobs from inside while they tried in vain to get through the
Barbarian to hit you. You can't exploit a pathing bug to "stick" a mob,
fleeing or otherwise, while you kill them. Fleeing is part of their
opportunity. To run into friends who might aggro and help them. Not
saying it's right. But VI has and they own the game.

For RL it would be a MUCH lower bar for the black/white line. For the
limited AI of the mobs, it's raise in their favor because of the reasons
above.

And if you get reported for getting free xp from exploting a pathing
bug, you should buy several cases and chill out by the pool until your
account is reinstated.
