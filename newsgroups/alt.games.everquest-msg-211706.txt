    I don't think someone should be framing a response in terms of
absolutes, though. Whenever someone asks me if a given mob is "tough", I
always frame the response in terms of the expected force going after the
target. For example, is Criare Sunmane, a named mob in Plane of Fire, tough?
Well, it hits in the 1000's per hit, and has an unresistable charm effect
that goes off every so often, so in absolute terms it's a killer. But most
raid groups that get to the Plane of Fire will kill him on their first
attempt, and he can easily be killed by raids that are too undermanned to go
after other elemental mobs. So if someone asked me if he was tough, I'd say
"no, he's pretty easy." I think the same thing is going on here. The person
answering is framing his answer in terms of the assumed power level of those
going after him.
