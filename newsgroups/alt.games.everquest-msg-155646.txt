You also need to beware of level restricted quests.

 I recently was collecting swirling shadow for a run of shadowscream armor.
Killing the skellies in shadeweavers I collected a bunch of Darkened
Jawbones.  I gave these to a level 3 and told him about the quest.  When he
turned them in Spiritist Katarina ate them and made a remark about how
someone like him couldn't have collected them.

Not a big loss but I have heard other quests, particularly epics have been
level restricted.
