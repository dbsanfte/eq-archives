>Lodi shield is more like <8k now (prexus/venril) >>

Screwed again by my impatience. LOL. Saw on Morell Thule in the Bazaar that
Bone Handled Scimitars are going for circa 4K. That's more than half  of what
they were selling for  three months ago.

So get a Lodi Shield AND a Bone Handled Scimitar. You should have enough left
over to buy the quest items for the Ring of Solstice or the PoTC.
