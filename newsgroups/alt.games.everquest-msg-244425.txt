 EQGraphicsDX9.DLL and EQGame.EXE were also downloaded..... that tells me
they did SOME fixes, because I doubt those files are required for Boat
Gnomes. Adding or removing NPCs can be done live if they choose to. I have
actually seen them do it with a merchant that was bugged in Kelethin.

They have put the Boat Gnomes in before without any downtime, except to the
ZONES INVOLVED, for a short period of time. Total server downtime means they
fixed something else!
