The Casino is located in Shandling's Roost in Shadow Haven. You enter
the place and it is in the next room farther inside. Although I have
never tried the place, I believe you are supposed to buy a token from
one of the female attendants and hand them to one of the guys behind
the counter. If you run out of plat on hand, there is a guy standing
in a corner who is a banker (just like an ATM in a casino).
