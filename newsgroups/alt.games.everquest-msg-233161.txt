Yeah, it can get to be a lot of fun.  Yesterday I did my first hard 
adventure, 65 shaman, 65 enchanter, 65 paladin, 65 rogue, 65 ranger, 64 
cleric.  We finished the collect 30 with about 15 minutes to spare, and 
one death, the cleric, while we had 4 mobs in the camp.  Talk about an 
intense few minutes there.
