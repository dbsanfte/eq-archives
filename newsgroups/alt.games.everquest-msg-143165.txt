Not that a disagree on the technical value, however - just like
McDonald's jingles, these groups produce intellectual property.  Stop
laughing.  

Whether it's PeeWee Herman or Mary Jane Girls, it's still intellectual
property.  It's not the CD or the DVD that counts - it's the contents.
Deplorable as the contents may be, it's still someone's property.

It's no different than Winona Ryder giving herself a discount at
Filenes or giving herself a discount at K-Mart.

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
