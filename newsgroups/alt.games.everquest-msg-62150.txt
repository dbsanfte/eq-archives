Well yes, you would block out part of your view - but you do in windowed 
mode too! You just don't have the option in windowed mode of what to block 
out. If you changed to fullscreen mode and made all your moveable windows 
completely opaque and sized them so they completely covered the border of 
your screen, you'd be acheiving something like the windowed mode and the 
bit in the middle where you could see the environment would still be 
bigger, higher resolution and show more then the little tunnel-vision box 
in windowed mode.

The command you are looking for is /wincolor <windowname> <R> <G> <B> 
<Transparency>

Windownames are CHAT, SPELL, PLAYER, PARTY, TARGET, BUFF, DATA, MAIN, INV, 
TRACK, or HOTBOX

R, G, and B are RGB values (no!) from 0 to 255
Transparency is 0 (off, i.e. completely see-through), 1 (25%), 2 (50%), 3 
(75%), 4 (100%, i.e. completely opaque)

So to make your chat window box solid black in fullscreen mode you would 
type:

/wincolor CHAT 0 0 0 4

To make it the same yucky cream colour as it is in windowed mode, it would 
be something like:

/wincolor CHAT 184 166 133 4

(that is from taking a screenshot, blurring out the texture and sampling 
the colour in Photoshop, should be pretty close)

Alternatively, you could manually edit the colours in the eqclient.ini 
file, so for a solid black chat box, you'd need the following lines in the 
[WindowColors] section:

ChatWinRed=0
ChatWinGreen=0
ChatWinBlue=0
ChatWinTrans=4

Changing the actual text colours for the stuff scrolling through the box is 
probably best done with a good ini file editor like EQu or Pasketti's
