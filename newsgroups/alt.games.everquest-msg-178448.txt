Basically, they are usually quite fertile between the ages of 18 and 28,
then at the magic age of 29 if they have spent their entire lives soley
pursuing their careers which most women have, then an alarm goes off in
their head which basically says something to the effect of, "Like, I kind of
need to like get pregnant right now or I'm going to die". So then I guess
they look around for all the millionaire guys over 6"2' around their age
that are supposed to be there and I suppose there aren't very many. There
probably aren't any guys their age around actually, why would there be?
There certainly aren't going to be a surplus of college educated guys since
the majority of people who graduate from college are women. 54-46 majority I
believe.
