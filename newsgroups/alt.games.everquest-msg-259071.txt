Ahh, but there is a subtle difference. When I get a new game, I read the 
manual so I have a cllue of what is going on. (I may not read it well, but 
I read enough to get an idea).

When I get a new electronic toy or whatnot, the first thing that you have 
to do is to try to figure it out without the manual. It is the right way to 
do it. Then you go to the manual, althoughthis step is ideally done when 
no-one is around...
