From the Nexus, go into Shadow Haven. Along the left wall there is a
small opening that leads across a stone bridge.  Go over the bridge
and keep going all the way back in the building.  At the back is a
split staircase.  Go up the right side.  There is a room entrance on
that side that is full of bookshelves.  Look for Goesl Sealsonich.
He's toward the back left side of the room.  He has several wiz
spells.  As of the latest patch he has the Nexus gate, portal, and
translocate spells as well as the minor and lesser familiars,
Garison's Mighty manna shock, and Enrick's Entombment of Ice.  level
50+ spells are being obtained in the Fungus cave that is off the Echo
Caverns.  Hope this helps.
