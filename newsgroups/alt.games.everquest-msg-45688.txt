3 suggestions:

Did you turn off the TV today?  =D

Pop the case and manually degauss. (or have a qualified repair technician do
it for you, *snicker*)

Get a new monitor, one that degausses.

Generally you shouldn't have 2 monitor/TVs within a few feet of each other,
but I do it too, I've got 3 monitors within 5 feet of each other, used to
have a TV there too but lightning took it out, and an old 14.4 modem that
was still hooked up, lol.
