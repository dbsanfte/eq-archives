Pretty fair summation, I reckon.

The downside from grinding the MM's (and this double XP event) is that
we now have lots of high-level characters who are REALLY feeble in
skills now - worse than if power-levelled in some cases, because at
least if you are being power-levelled you get the chance of *some*
skill-ups in melee/spellcasting.

Of course, this sneakily means more people will be wanting to play in
the higher-level areas in the latest expansions that Sony is
pimping...  What a coincidence, eh?  Maybe I'm too cynical.
