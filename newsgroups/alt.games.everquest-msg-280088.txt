Read that link.  Back when I was 65 I did it, mostly "solo" (2-boxing,
cleric was there to loot obviously), in less than two weeks, without giving
up my regular raiding schedule.  As far as time sinks go in this game, it's
on the minor end of the spectrum.

Nobody got rezzed?  Otherwise, cleric epic would have made a difference. 
I'm guessing it *did* make a difference, it was just one of the other
clerics who was holding it.  =)

Clerics essentially aren't needed for Chardok at the 65+ range.  Avoiding
unnecessary faction hits shouldn't be difficult.  One faction hit from the
king won't turn you KOS.
