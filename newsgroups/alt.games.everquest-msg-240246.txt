I greatly recommend playing as a newbie, gathering ingredients like spider
silks and bone chips and low quality hides and even eggs, and selling them
in the bazaar. You will be able to make enough money to buy ridiculously
good gear cheaply, then  go bash critters until about 20 when LDON is
supposed to take over (haven't tried it yet, but have heard many good
things).

There is a giant amount of quests if you are interested, many dungeons that
are barely touched upon now (take a group) and much fun to be had simply
wandering about looking at things. Until level 10 you are basically
indestructible, and so if you can pay for a sow and an invis, it can be fun
to wander around a dungeon that a level 65 might be worried about soloing
because death is just a teleport to your bind spot.

My level 1 halfling rogue has wandered (very slowly, using sneak/hide)
through many dungeons such as the Hole, and so long as you don't hit a trap
or fall, you seem to be invisible to all the mobs in most of the old world
dungeons (sol a seems to see through all invis), and if he dies, it's just a
run back from the bind spot.
