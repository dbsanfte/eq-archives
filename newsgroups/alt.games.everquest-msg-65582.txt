EQ doesn't change anyone. EQ is merely something that an already
addictive person grabs on to.

Everquest doesn't ruin marriages - EQ is just what some people are
playing while they ruin their marriage themselves.


Back in the heyday of AD&D, various religious groups and therapists
(and the media) tried to blame that game for all kinds of problems,
and usually could pull up one or two anecdotal examples of kids who
had been 'damaged' by playing the game. Further investigation always
revealed a kid who already had all kinds of problems, long before he
ever started to play the game.

Games don't cause problems - they manifest problems that already
existed.
