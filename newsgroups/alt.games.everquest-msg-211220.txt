Hi All;

I'm a fairly new EQ player that has chosen to be a Cleric. I quit meleeing
around level 20 or so. Now I'm about to get YaulpV and Hammer of Judgment.
I've been reading a little about how some clerics will solo using this
combination for farming or even in XP groups. I don't intend to melee in XP
groups and miss healing someone, however, I would like to be able to solo
farm for plat.  My gear overall is blah (that's why I need to learn to farm)
so I have a couple of questions to ask other clerics:

1.  Where would a mediocre equipped 56 cleric be able to melee solo for
plat/loot? I have only grouped since about level 20, so soloing is basically
new to me.   I have all expansions.

2.  How in the world will I be able to raise my crappy 1hb skills without
constant death?

3. I read somewhere that I could use someone's pet to raise my 1hb skills.
I have a 55 chanty friend. Would his pet work for raising my 1hb skill, and
if so, how do we do it?

Thank you all in advance for your time and suggestions.  Any and all
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
