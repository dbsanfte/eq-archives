Did you attend to all the reports in the compatibility report issued by
WinXp when upgrading? such as drivers etc?

I had a small fault when I upgraded. The directory in which EQ was installed
was given a write protect default by WinXp. Right click on the EQ dir and
see if the write protect tab is ticked, If ti is click it off and apply to
whole directory content.
