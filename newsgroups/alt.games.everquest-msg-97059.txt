Not at all. I've read them, I just disagree.

The implication is that the combination of first and last names into a 
single word is itself against the rules, even if it's not especifically 
spelled out. Spirit of the law versus letter of the law and all that.

What I'm arguing is that the fact that a GM changed it should give you an 
indication that the name was against the rules, even if it's not 
especifically written down in any particular clause. The names the GMs 
haven't changed yet, but are obviously against the rules can be explained 
by the general lassitude exhibited by the GMs when it comes to the naming 
convention. I wish they were a bit more aggressive in this matter.
