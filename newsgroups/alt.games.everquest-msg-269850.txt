If you fix the magelo (put your skills in so it shows correct AC)
it's a lot easier judge your gear overall with the correct AC total.

At your level I found the 10:1 hp:ac equivalancy worked pretty well
as a rule of thumb, but really "it depends" is the name of the game.
If your AC is high enough that the mobs you're fighting don't get
too many max hits then it's cool to work on hp.  If you hp are high
enough that you don't die to damage spikes before a heal lands, then
it's good to work up your AC to make those damage spikes rarer.

You might try posting your query to the Equipment forum at

(be a good idea to fix your magelo first)
