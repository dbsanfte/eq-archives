I am a level 14 bard who got tired of Crushbone and the BBM, so I decided to
go to Erudin to pick up my level 14 song. I figured once I get selo's going,
I'd just stick to the road and I should be able to make it across the
continent to queynos fairly easily. A boat trip to Erudin and it would just
be a nice long trip. Now as I start to read some of the guides, it looks a
little dicier than I thought. I don't really *need* the song, I just figured
travelling to new places is always good in the game. So am I foolish to try
to do this solo? I sure don't want to have to retrieve my stuff a half a
continent away, especially when I'm not familiar with the area. It also
seems to me that most of the people on my server are in and around Gfay.
I've been to every zone in Faydwer and to the OOT, EC and all of FP. I've
never seen more than a handful of players in amy of these zones. I work
nights, so I'm usually on late when there are fewer people on. Should I jsut
wait til I level up more? Matbe work my way across the zones slowly? Any
advice whether on the whole trip or individual zones would be helpful.

Thanks,
Curtis
