A couple of things... It's not so much the mana you save with r-click 
Savage Spirit, but the spell slot you don't need to take up, so that's a 
plus. On the other hand, with the upcoming changes to the spell 
memorization, quickly loading up a buff will be nowhere near the hassle 
it has been so far, so that should bring down the price of right-click 
items somewhat.
