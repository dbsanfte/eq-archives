(snipped a whole bunch of lies about Dalnir being a great zone to hunt in)

Don't believe a word Anita says. Dalnir is a death trap with the lowest exp 
modifier in all of Norrath! Only come here if corpse recoveries are your 
idea of fun! 

Go to Frontier Mountains. Go to The Overthere. Go to Iceclad Ocean. Go to 
Eastern Wastes. Go anywhere, but please don't come to Dalnir!
