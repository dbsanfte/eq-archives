Ah, foolish grasshopper. You are confusing what's good for the goose
with what is good for the gander. Saving time is good for *anyone*.
Saving time by "skpping over content" is good for players, but against
the 2002 release of "The Vision" (TM). Come to think of it, it's always
been against the Vision.  VI doesnt' want you skipping over a dungeon
that's supposed to take you hours to crawl through to get to the big
prize by just popping fifty folks to the bottom in one minute.
