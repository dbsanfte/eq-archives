No. But in the context of their game world, Blizzard most certainly
does. Why are you still having trouble with that concept?


>You're not a blizzard customer.

Correct. Though their willingness to punish idiots makes me seriously
tempted to give them a try. I like a company that cares about the
quality of the game experience for the customers that aren't drooling
fools.


>You use "ass" in your sig.

Thank you, but we'd already established that your problem is
comprehension, not reading. You really didn't have to go to all the
trouble of finding a three-letter word to demonstrate your mastery of
basic reading skills.


>You make a poke at christians in your sig.

No, I make a poke at people who would use some dusty old tome as a
justification for limiting the rights of people who don't share their
views.

You draw some remarkable, and highly incorrect, conclusions based on a
few Usenet posts.

>connotations which you are terribly offended by. 

You're mistaken again - I'm not offended by it. Unlike you, however, I
understand why it is offensive to many.
