The easiest to obtain items with a reasonable mana regen rate:

1.  High level enchanter
2.  Mage who can summon Mod Rods plus any item with mana free healing

There are items in game with Flowing Thought effect that raise your mana
regen rate, but they are not anywhere near as effective as the above two
methods.
