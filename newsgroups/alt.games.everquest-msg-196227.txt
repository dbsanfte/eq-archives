Since this point keeps getting pounded on and isn't really the one I
made, I thought I would reiterate what i said:

If your husband (and I mean the royal "you," not you specifically)
found something significant different from you sexy, you are probably
the first person he would lie to about it if he were going to lie at
all. Wives are notoriously unreliable as reporters of their husbands'
pecadillos.

That does not mean I assume your husband is lying. It means that, if I
had any interest in your husband's kinks, you are not the person I
would ask about them.

I made the mistake of telling my girlfriend early on that I had a
particular attraction to Japanese women. To this day (eight years
later,) I still deal with the reprecussions of that statement every
time I am called upon in a social situation to interact with anyone
who is both Asian and female. As a result, I have never mentioned my
things for redheads, Sephardic women, petite women, zaftig women, or
any other category into which my tall, beautiful, blonde girlfriend to
whom I have cleaved faithfully these eight years, forsaking all others
because I do not want to stomp on any more of her insecurities. I am
more comfortable telling an entire forum of more or less total
strangers this than I am about telling her, much in the way that I
would be more comfortable sitting in an overstuffed chair as opposed
to say, having my fingernails pulled out with pliers while Michael
Bolton covers of Led Zeppelin songs were piped in through the
speakers.

/g incoming Neanderthal attitudes.

If you are that rarest of creatures, a woman without body
insecurities, I tip my hat to you and envy your boyfriend. Don't
bother telling me you are, though. Women are even less reliable
supporters of their own body issues than they are of their husbands'
preferences. I have never met a woman who doesn't have one or more
particular types of women by whom they are deeply intimidated, but
I've met plenty who claimed so.

If your husband (again the royal you) enjoys any of the physical types
that he believes you are intimidated by and has any consideration for
your feelings (or love of sleep,) you would not be able to get an
admission of that attraction out of him with a straight-edged razor
and a box of rock salt.

This is my experience. You may see it as wrong-headed, but I am
extremely unlikely to be swayed from my position on it.

Getting back to the subject in the most circuitous way possible, I
can't understand why anyone would prefer the old models to the new
other than because the old models left more of what your character
actually looked like to the imagination. Everything was SQUARE, a
function of the lower polygon count of old models. Does anyone really
fetishize legs, breasts, and faces that look like they're built from
children's blocks?

The new models are still unrealistic, but significantly less so. Three
of my four favorite characters use the male ogre and female dark elf
model. How stupid my ogre looked contributed significantly to why I
did not play another one when I switched servers from Bertox to Torv.

For the DE females, I consider the new model to have two huge
advantages--getting rid of the thong and looking like they could
actually swing a sword without having their arms fall off or their
waist snap in half. Oh, yeah. I also like that they can now have black
hair.

I find the new face on DE females to be somewhat more angular and
patrician than I care for IRL, but it's a step up from old square
face.
