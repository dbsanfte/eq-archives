Remembering that some folks missed the scheduled downtime message for the
previous patch or two, I wanted to post this real quick...

Scheduled Downtime Tuesday, March 19th Wednesday, March 13 2002 14:57 PST

On Tuesday, March 19th, at 12AM PST, (8AM GMT), all servers will be brought
down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 8 hours.

Ok folks...  For those that were boggled last time this happened, (and I was
one of them that was taken off guard, I admit...  hehe)  If you've been
paying attention to what everyone here is talking about with the changes,
you'll understand why there is an 8 hour patch coming up.  Also people,
remember that Verant does the patch of the patch immediately afterwards as
well...  ;op

Basically, Tuesday is a good day to visit relatives and friends you haven't
seen in awhile...  Go outside and let the sun touch your face...  Catch up
on some reading you've been meaning to do...  LOL

See you all later!
