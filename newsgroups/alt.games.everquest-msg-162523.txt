Hehe well, I guess its hard to backup what you claim on here because
somebody is always going to disagree with you.

Me personally?  I dont profess to know much about rangers on a day-in
day-out basis, I know what their buffs are, which ones are good and which
ones fuck up my epic, I leveled one from 59-60 and had a chance to "play"
with it, and a 63 guildie ranger is one of the people I group/talk to pretty
much every day.

Id say he knows his class very well and I trust what he says.

Oh im not refering to soloing at all in my "well archery IS just a little
too nice.."

You mean people actually stick to topic threads?!?!?!  What are you man,
