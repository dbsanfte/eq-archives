Oh yeah, C2 is totally addicting. Had a C2 caster on a Fear raid last week.
I could non-stop nuke the pulls and med up to 90% before the next pull came
in. Being lvl 48, with a 6 second cast nuke I never got aggro but was
helping quite a lot.

btw. Had a Hate raid last Saturday. Total party wipeout at entrance, wipeout
just before we could do a break-in (coming down from the wall) and at least
2 times after that at which we had to let clerics camp. Had 2 more personal
deaths later on. Is Hate always that bad or were we just damn unlucky? We
had 5 groups with 28 persons total. 4 clerics, 3 enchanters.
