Certainly glad they shut down the game for 7 hours for such a dopey,
sniggling, queer little brain fart...

Thankfully, the patch had more to it that that.

If it were just that non-sensical PvP request, it would be the equivalent of
shutting down the world's phones cause a handful of people want to be able
to use helium-voices while talking...

Who are these monster wanna-bes and why don't they discover...say...stamp
collecting? I can't believe EQ honored that request and wasted precious time
programming it. Wow. The miracles never end.

I'd like my character to be able to switch nose ends, you know plaid,
stripes, polka dots, etc.  Can someone waste some time programming that for
me?

Appreciate it. Sorry for the next long shut down, guys.... just gotta role
play different nose ends.
