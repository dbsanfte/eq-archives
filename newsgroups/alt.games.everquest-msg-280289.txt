How is that different?  The only difference is that you authorized Sony
to automatically charge your card any money that you owe them rather
than you sending them a check every month.

They got your permission to charge you what you owe them.  They just
charged the wrong amount and then fixed the mistake.

Ignoring this particular example, assuming we are just talking about
stealing in general, would it be ethical to steal from a corporation?
Is the only thing keeping you from stealing from, say, Microsoft the
fact that you might get caught?

You authorized it.

It is.

"Upon your acceptance of these terms, we have the right to
automatically charge your credit card the Account fee plus any
applicable taxes we are required to collect, and you authorize us to do
so."

You agreed to pay 'em a certain amount of money.  You agreed to let 'em
charge you that fee automatically.  The only mistake was that they
charged part of the fee--that you agree to pay--a little later than
usual.  They felt oblidged to point this out to you.
