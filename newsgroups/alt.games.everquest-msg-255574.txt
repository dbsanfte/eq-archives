The key to getting rich is to save a good part of what you make and invest
it wisely. Actual income matters very little. It is possible to get rich as
a plumber and to be bankrupt as a assembley language programmer.

Most of our economy comes from small buisnesses (70%) . Most of the people
who make extremely larrge incomes do so as owners of small buisnesses. Not
sure how you relate that to soloing though since customers are far more
demanding than any guild leader or petticoat guild officer ever could be.
