I think that would be fine, since most are under the impression that
assassinations are harder than slaughter.  (What's the old Verant line
we always hear.. risk vs. reward?  Slighter risk of failing the
mission, but a crack at an item)


Other missions usually have at least a named that does drop items. 
Seems reasonable to me that a named target of an assassination should
also drop an item.  Maybe there's something in the code where the boss
pops halfway thru the kills that prevents it.
