That kind of depends on how you look at it, really :-)

No doubt every item in the game is assigned some base price, in whole
number units of copper pieces. All the math for that would be easy.

The problem comes in when you hit that copper value with a multiplier
to handle the impact of faction and charisma. When Verant does the
math for buying stacks, they're (apparently) grabbing the base number
that exists behind the scenes rather than the value that is displayed
to the user.
