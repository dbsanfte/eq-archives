That isn't being "Evil", it is being an ass.

Most people would not know how to role-play "evil" if they tried.
Thank god people are "nice" by nature in EQ. Who wants to play a game
where most people are intentionally mean or abusive.

RP'ing evil does not require the player to be a jerk. It just requires
a little more creativity. An evil cleric could heal a good character
and then inform them that thier evil god has marked them, and that
their soul is stained. (This may cause a good character to return to
their home city or temple and pray for forgiveness.) . An evil
character could save a good character from a train and then mock the
good characters weakness. Laugh at them and show them how powerful
thier evil god has made them.

You can swap both above cases (good helping evil). The most important
thing is that players are still helping each other. Adding the GvE RP
makes the game more immersive and fun for all.

>Third, I've only seen players who try to role-play their character as an

Verant has created a world where players are forced to group and help
each other. A "Good" cleric can RP rez'ing and "Evil" character quite
easily. The cleric could charge more, or demand that the evil
character renounce their god to the whole zone before casting the
spell. The "Good" cleric could cast the spell in the hope that the
experience will turn the evil character to the "light".

Evils grouping with goods is just an oppurtunity to corrupt and
convert them. (and vice-versa)

You get out of RP what you put in. Use your brain and have a little
fun with it.

Cheers
