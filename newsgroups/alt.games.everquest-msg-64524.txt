personally i dont cheat i know it can be done and i have seen it done but to
me its just nice to use winamp by actually use winamp look up a map on eq
atlas or an item on alakhazamn or read a epic guide while doing an epic ay i
see it if you wanted to cheat you can sheat without this program there are
ways to tab out to me it lets me use my computer how it was meant to be used
without games crashing and shit overall its an awsome program and i totally
reject the idea that its a utility for cheating as to me any game is
cheatable but thats not my reason for useing it and it is an awsome prog end
of story
