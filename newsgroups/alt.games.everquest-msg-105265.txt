A Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick is one of the BEST backstabbing weapons a
rogue can get at lower levels.  It is not magic so it sells for less than a
comparable magic weapon (around 200pp).  Granted that is more than you have
right now, but be on the lookout for one as soon as you can afford it.  They
drop in Luclin (I forget which zone) and are fairly common so if you have
Luclin you might be able to get one there a little cheaper than in Freeport
or East commons.

You should also be able to get a Velium Spear.  They sell for around 10-20
pp.  They are cheap because the stats are not very good, but they are magic.
They proc with velium shards at level 25, but hopefully by then you will
have a better weapon.

Another decent weapon for a rogue (not piercing though) is a gnoll hide
lariat.  This weapon is low damage, but is very fast.  It would make a good
off hand weapon when you get dual wield.  These sell for around 10pp.  They
drop in South Karana, and you may be able to pick one up there by paying
more than a merchant would pay to a player that has looted one.

Good Luck
