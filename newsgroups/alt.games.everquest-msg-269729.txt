I hope while they're at it they also put the recipes in the right books.
That's a major reason why people are doing this; the recipes are screwed up.

There's no reason in the world that Outfitters can make every piece of
ironmongery in the game *except* iron buckles and iron studs.  Similarly,
why is it that Craftsmen make Burlap Patterns?  I can understand and would
accept that an Outfitter would have to go to a Craftsman to get the paper
for the pattern, but the pattern itself should be made by the tailor (the
aspiring Outfitter).  That's one of the things tailors do, they make
clothing patterns.  They don't go kyoodling off to a cabinetmaker (or a
papermaker) for a finished pattern.

Now that I've specialized in Armoursmith, I'd expect to go to a Tailor to
get my patterns, no more making patterns for me.  Similarly, I'd expect to
get my more advanced paddings from him.  But why do I have to get studs from
an Alchemist or Jeweler (dunno which one will be making them)?

An Outfitter should go to Scholars for inks and stinks, and to Craftsmen for
woods and goods, and they should come to us for the rusty bits.
