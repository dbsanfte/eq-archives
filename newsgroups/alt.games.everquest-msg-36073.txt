The other day I was playing with my level 3 cleric, killing snakes and what
not. Then this level 1 twinked warrior KSes me. I get no experience,
obviously, I'm somewhat ticked off. He says "I'm sorry" and then I say
"Don't do it again."

I run off and try to kill some more stuff. Here's the conversation that
followed over /tell

Him: "You know, you're very rude"

Me: Um, no. You KSed me.

Him: It was an accident

Me: I still have a reason for being angry. Being mad at someone who KSes you
doesn't make you rude. KSing someone, on the other hand, does.

Then he proceeds to ask me if I can cas lev on him or if I have any warrior
gear for trade...so I whip out the ol' /ignore. When will the idiots STOP!?
