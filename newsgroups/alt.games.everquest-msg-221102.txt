It should be difficult for the class with the most defensive ability to 
maintain aggro, just as it is difficult for the classes with the most 
offensive ability to avoid it.  Hybrids are too close to warriors in 
terms of defence to be allowed that kind of aggro.  One or the other 
needs to change.

Wouldn't the simple solution be to downgrade AC and HP on hybrids just 
enough to make the better defensive capabilities of the warrior balance 
equally against the better aggro of the hybrid "in a normal xp group 
situation"?

The alternative, to avoid nerfing, could be to upgrade the damage dealt 
by mobs and also increase the AC/HP of a warrior to the same effect?  
This involves a lot more effort however.

Either of these should only be done to the extent that a warrior's 
superior defence equally balances with the benefit of better aggro of 
the hybrid allowing fuller DPS and earlier slowing.

I think if this was done, the choice between a hybrid or a warrior as a 
tank would be based more on the ability of the player and the situation 
rather than always leaning towards the aggro control.
