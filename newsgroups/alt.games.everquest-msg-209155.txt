DarkTyger, I agree with what you're saying (I think they'll move the shared
bank slots over to Live without being part of the new expansion) but.....

Prior to LoY release if you had a character on the Test server prior to
some-such date they released the bank slots, Froglok characters and I
*believe* the cartography system to Test Server members with a
non-disclosure agreement deal.  Of course to get that you had to answer an
email and sign up, etc, but still just wanted to point out that they have
before released some stuff to the Test Server that was for an expansion
only.

I know, knitpicking, but still, been a rough night of work, so what do you
expect, eh?  :)
