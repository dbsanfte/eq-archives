The blue line is a percentage of how close  _one_  yellow bubble is to
filling up. So if the blue line is 25% long across the bar, then you
will also notice that the current bubble that is starting to fill in
as yellow, will be 25% filled. The reason for the existence of the
blue line is to allow you to more accurately gauge how much EXP you
are earning per kill.
