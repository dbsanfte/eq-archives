I have gotten both the Giant laceless sandal and the string from
Tiny. He is an extremely rare spawn in NK. If you are not a tracker
forget it.

Why did you want that string anyway? If you want a waist item for
a caster go get a twilight cloth cord from Twilight sea it drops off
named shadows there. Much much easier to get than the string.
