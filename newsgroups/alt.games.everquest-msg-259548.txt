I don't know. I smoked for 17 years. I always knew that it was a stupid 
thing to do and that quitting all boiled down to my making a conscious and 
dedicated decision to simply not light another one. The eventual decision 
was easy. The execution was very difficult. Luckily, my doctor was thrilled 
to help me out, so the money I had been spending on smokes started going 
toward my welbutrin (sp?) prescription and the Nicoderm CQ patch.

There's no shame in needing help, only in needing it and never seeking it.
