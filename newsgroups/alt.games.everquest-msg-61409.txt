Because the entire backbone of EQ is built around mana regeneration?

Face it, increase the rate at which one melee character does damage,
and you have a marginal increase in your group's kill per hour rate.
Increase the rate at which your cleric regenerates mana, though,
and you see the down time for the entire group plummet.

Looking at the Luclin skills coming up, its the mana regeneration
ones I intend to concentrate on first, far easier than a rare drop
off a boss mob that takes a dozen casters to kill, or learning
a dozen otherwise useless skills up to grand master level, I can just
forgo leveling for a while and continue to work for normal exp.

hoping to make 54 before Luclin, cause I'm sure not leveling
for quite a while after that!
