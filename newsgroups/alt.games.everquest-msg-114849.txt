Yes, you can do most, if not all, of the epics a bit at a time.  When you
can start the epic depends on which one it is, for druids, you can do things
such as gather up some of the foraged items as soon as your foraging is high
enough.  Some of the NPCs you have to talk to will not respond to you until
you are a certain level, for at least some of the epics.  I started my
shaman epic at around level 26, and have completed bits and pieces of it
over time since then.
