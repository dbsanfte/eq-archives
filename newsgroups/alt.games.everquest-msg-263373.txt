I've read the WoW beta boards, (not with a microscope and pad to tick 
off positive and negative comments mind you), and I've seen the same 
reactionary knee jerk 'this game sucks and blizzard is wringing all the 
fun out of what is there with all the nerfs' posts I've seen in every 
other game I've beta'd. perhaps not as many, but then I see more 
responses along the line of 'Blizzard can do no bad, SC was the greatest 
game evah! Diablo II was the greatest expansion ever made! etc...' than 
I typically see on a beta board.. so there's certainly some fanboi 
action going on there.

For those that are interested, I just read this:
http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2004/10/everquest-ii-my-opinion.html

Which summarizes a few things.

For the record, I'm an EQ player of 5 years (retired), did a beta and 
release stint in Galaxies (and they asked me back into the JTL beta way 
early, but I turned em down), and am currently playing FFXI with no 
plans to jump on either incoming Boat. (I stress test beta'd WoW and 
technically got in it's beta a few days later, apparently on the 
strength of some of my beta feedback or dumb luck, but got fed up after 
trying to download it's frickin bit torrent download for 5 days, and 
transferred it (actual legitamate transfer, they have a proceedure...) 
to the drooling blizzard fanboi that's a friend of mine... he's got 4 
35th level characters so far. I do have this to say, if they are going 
Bittorrent for their patcher when it goes live, they better have a way 
to turn off uploads; my buddy got his cable cut off for three days for 
'excessive outbound bandwith usage', it uploaded something like 14 times 
the data it downloaded.)

My current plan is, if everyone abandons me in Final Fantasy, I will
a) See if I can hook up with a static party in FF, if not I may quit as 
getting a party is a pita when you are a monk. (I outdamage every other 
class I've ever grouped with save one, but my numbers don't LOOK that 
impressive; I'm spamming lots of little hits, instead of big numbers 
every 5 seconds +)
b) Failing that, I'll check back into the Hotel Eqfornia.
c) Or, I may just look at getting more sleep and having more money by 
quitting all of them. Maybe work on my stories some. I dunno.

Oh, was just checking out the EQ2players.station.sony.com page... No 
navigation past the top banner works in my browser. Too bad so sad.
