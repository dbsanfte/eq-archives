In case you ever wondered about these high priced items in the bazaar I saw
this on Player Auction:

30,000 Platinum Pieces

Delivered to the Bazaar or most major banks within 1 day of payment.

Bid with confidence! All transactions are completely confidential!

For faster delivery (suggested, but not required): Once you send payment
(see below) set up a trader with a batwing or similar cheap item for sale
for the amount purchased, and we will log in and purchase that item!

hmmmm wonder if I could snag someone elses plat this way????
