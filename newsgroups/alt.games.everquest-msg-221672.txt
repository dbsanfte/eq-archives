    Hmm well being an SK if you get into trouble the procedure is to find a
spot out of agro range on any spawn and feign...

    Nobles/remains is my favorite camp there, because you can hold down so
many placeholders from the one spot. It's also (for some odd reason)
apparently quite unpopular. I can't recall a time when we've zoned into
veksar and someone else had been camping it.

    It's not really an issue anyway, I rarely have trouble due to invis
dropping and when I do its easily dealt with. I've never died on my way
through veksar although people I've been trying to escort have. The IVU I
can cast on others is a random timer pita type.

    I have *no* idea how you could single pull any named that was up to
highborns. Aside from the few available at that camp, I can't think of one
that wouldn't bring a couple of adds.....
