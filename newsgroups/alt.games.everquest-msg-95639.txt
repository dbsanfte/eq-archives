For an exp-giving mob?  About 3-4 minutes.  Most level 45ish mobs have 
between 4500-6000hp, and if I'm kiting, I make sure to do so in a place 
where the mobs don't resist much.  Once I get my DoTs on, the resist the 
targeted resist by 45 points too, so it's easy to keep them applied.
Not quite as nice as it was at level 50 though, where I was doing 1200ish 
and fighting mobs with 2500-3000hp.
