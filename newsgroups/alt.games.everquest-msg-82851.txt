Generally a VERY bad idea to play PK on normal servers. You can only 
kill other PK players (think i seen 4 in the year i played), you can not 
get teleports, buffs, or any kind of spells cast on you by non-pvp 
players. So if you go PK on a normal server, youre basically screwed. 
Know 2 people who made that mistake, one restarted char at level 13, the 
other at level 9 (gave me the items to transfer, deleted their char, 
started it again with same name, and started playing from level 1 again)
