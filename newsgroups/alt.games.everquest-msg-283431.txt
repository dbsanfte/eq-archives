Well I did use focus items under 50 and found them pretty effective, 
mostly, as you say, in terms of the regen, but also they literally 
boosted the level of the pet a bit, which meant more hits, fewer 
resists, and so on.

It does sound insane at first glance, because we'd be talking about 
loaning out an item that runs in the 100s of Kpps.  But then again, I've 
been in guilds where such things would be done as a matter of course, 
and with friends.  Trouble is, since its been roughly a year and a half 
since I've played this character, I have neither guild nor friends at 
the moment.

Asking strangers, no, I've seen too many scams, and would rather not 
look as though I was trying one.  You're thinking "SOE would have a 
record and could force them to give it back and ban them" which is 
right, they could.  But I've literally seen them say "we don't enforce 
that, you knew you were risking the item when you gave it to them"

You could also have someone around the right level look at your pet to 
see what level it is; find out what level your pet normally is, find 
someone that level, and if your focussed pet is yellow to them, bingo.

Again, similar to your plan of just borrowing a focus item, you can 
arrange for someone who has unlocked the right LDoN to buy it for you, 
giving them sufficient LDoN purchased augments, which they trade in for 
refund points, buy the item, then give it to you.  You hope.  At least 
here its a case of me trusting them, instead of trying to convince them 
to trust me:)
