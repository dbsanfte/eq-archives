Here, let me help you out...
/quote "Tom"

I play a level 60 Enchanter & level 50 Druid as my main characters.  I
can definately relate to your concerns over looting.  Casters always
get the short end of the stick...

rofl.  And you've grouped with me in EQ how many times?  You have
precisely zero actual knowledge and experience of my game-play, and

_your_ gaming style differs significantly from the "judgemental
asshole" posting style you're engaging in here.
