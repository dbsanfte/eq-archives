It is all/all, and anyone without the ability to lev themselves
has good reason to want one.  Sadly it -is- part of the
mage epic, and rare drop off a rare pop mob, so its
worth 50 to 100 Kpp to MQ; since its not really -that-
nice to be able to levitate yourself, most people don't
have one.

Would sure be nice if the mage epic used  Quillmane's legs
drop, which are relatively useless, instead of the cloak,
which seems to be unique in its ability to allow clerics,
warriors, etc, to levitate themselves.  Either that or put
another levitate item in the game!
