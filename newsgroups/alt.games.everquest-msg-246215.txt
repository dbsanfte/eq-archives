Started a Warrior and a friendly passer by gave me some junk he could not 
sell.  One item was a 2H Piercing weapon.  I checked out the Skills window on 
my warrior and it does not list 2H Piercing.  The weapon I got specifically 
states that a War can use it though along with a paladin, cleric, and 
something else too.  Does 2H Pierce just go along with the Piercing skill?  Or 
do warriors not get 2H Pierce?
