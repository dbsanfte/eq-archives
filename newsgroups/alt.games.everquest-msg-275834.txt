True, those who would rather solo should be allowed to follow their needs,
but then what about those of us who'd rather group?  I mean, we've all
played in eq (or maybe even eq2) with that one guy who has solo'd up into
his mid 20's or early 30's and now has no idea how to function in a group.
Do we want someone like that in all our groups?  Of course, many people have
friends and guildies that they group with frequently and that work well with
them, but there will always be new people that you group with and if they
have solo'd their way up to where they are they will have no idea how to
function as part of the group.

I guess what I'm saying is that you can't have a game that pleases everyone.
If a game is advertised as group oriented then it should be group oriented.
There's enough options out there that everyone should be able to find what
is most fun for them.  If EQ doesn't float your boat, try something else.
