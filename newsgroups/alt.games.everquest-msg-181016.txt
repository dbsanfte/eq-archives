A mage is a class with its future ahead of him, a wizard has only his past
to brag about. After all nerfs and addon releases, there should be no reason
to make a wizard these days. Every other class has got what a wizard can do,
and teleports arent an issue anymore. If you manage to level your wizard,
you will most likely be LFG the rest of the game.

Your mage will nuke nearly as good, and your spells are alot easier to
aqquire, and you get an uber pet. Why anyone would want to make a wizard
these days is beyond me. As a wizard, you just aint useful to anyone, except
for someone wanting a quick port to CS or EJ, but thats not gonna get you
into an XP group, but it might give you 20plat.

Teleports are not an issue anymore with PoP. Wizards have become a GIMP MAGE
in every aspect after PoP. The only thing a wizard can do is.. uh.. <enter
class advantage here>, i don't really know. We can quadkite better than
everyone else, but VI has been so damn strict on wizards that they didn't
release any new AoE spells in PoP, and that changed just about everything we
where uber at in Kunark and Velious.
If you time our quadkites with a necro, you will actually see the necro kill
single mobs faster than a wizard can quadkite after 1 pull and progressivly
get ahead of the wizard. The DPS of the wizard has been nerfed into such a
state, that it really stinks. I think out of all offensive classes, the
wizard has the lowest DPS of them all according to parsed logs on
graffe.com.

Generally, the wizard scene is pretty passive, they never complain about
broken abilities, nerfed spells or broken spells. So you prolly wont see any
fixes or new abitilities worth getting like you saw the revamp mages got.
Wizards are generally stupid and are happy their shocks do 25 more damage
than a mage at level 44 for the same mana, even though a mage has an uber
pet up his sleeve to boost. The "we are uber nukers" motto is just a false
attitude that once was true, but these days it isn't.

If VI continues to nerf the wizards into being just able to go into trader
mode in the bazaar, i doubt you will ever see them complain about it. They
will say... "oh i'm still happy, i can still type on my keyboard". They are
a bunch of retards mostly. There are a few wizards trying to get the class
going again, but we are let down by these passive wizards who know nothing
about design, balance or justice. VI wont be listening to 5 wizards, but
will listen to 934324534 druids.

There is a reason for those numbers... trust them :-)
