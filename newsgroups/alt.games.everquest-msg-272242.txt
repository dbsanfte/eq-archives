But is that a reasonable assumption?

I joined my tradeskill specific society, The Seven Smiths Society in
Graystone Yard, this weekend, and I'm already ranked 2 out of 2-300 members
after completing 6 orders; number one has 900 pts. I don't think there's 30
ppl there who have done more than one order. 

I know why this is. There's little or no incitement to do society orders. I
bet most ppl don't even realize the benefits of a higher-level society, and
society orders are generally such poor business, that you feel an idiot
doing them.

You can hardly blame people for finding their coin numbers more interesting
than obscure concepts like society level and status points. The worst thing
is that there's no easy way to mobilize the necessary team spirit.

When I look at how little progress my society has done towards level two
this weekend, despite my own intense efforts, I doubt that I can keep up the
spirit for very long. After all, who's thanking me for it? More or less
alone I'll never be able to make a difference.

Speaking of ignorance, are there any side-effects of a high personal society
status or is it just there for the glory of those of us silly enough to put
a tremendous amount of effort into the society for the benefit of a large
number of lazy egoists :-)
