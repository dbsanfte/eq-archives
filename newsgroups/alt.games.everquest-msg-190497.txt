    See above. I agree that in PoP (the 61+ game), there's not enough stuff
for people. Part of that is flags, part of that is just plain old bad
design. I see a ton of places where people could get XP in upper tier zones,
but not many people can get there and the ones that can prefer to slum and
get the easiest/best XP they can find.

    Between gathering mobs, killing mobs, and medding back up, your average
quadder is killing four mobs every ten minutes. If your full group can't
beat that pace, you've got bigger issues than the quadder. And that's
assuming the quadder and the group want to kill the same mobs - most
quadders go places nobody else wants to hunt, like Raptors in TD.

    AE groups are massively destructive. No argument there, either.
