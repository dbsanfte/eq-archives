I recently joined a Time-flagged guild on FV and on my first day with the
guild we raided in Air. It was the first time I'd ever set foot in one of
the elemental zones and before it was over we had killed Xegony without
breaking a sweat. I was thrilled. For some reason that I didn't understand
at the time we were summoning the 85'ers to the three camps where we would
form up for the fight. The RL called for each class one at a time to run out
from the zone-in and die, after which they would be summoned. So the Clerics
were told "Run from the zone-in and die!", as were the Paladins, and the
Shamans, and then when he got to the Rangers, he shouted "Ok RANGERS, do
what you do BEST!"
