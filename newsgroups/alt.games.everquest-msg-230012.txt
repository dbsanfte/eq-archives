Keep piercing maxed before all else.  If you're soloing at low levels,
before dual wield, if your piercing is maxed then it's ok to switch out to a
1hs or 1hb after the first backstab.

It would be much faster to just get hit 17 for dual wield and then stick a
low delay 1hs or 1hb in the secondary.  Dump some training points into the
skills if you're impatient.

The skills will max eventually, especially between 39-50 when your skills
have hit the pre-51 cap.

By high levels, you will just be using 2 piercers anyway, but is nice to
have the other skills maxed along the way, as weapon upgrades can come when
you don't expect, and getting a nice new 1hb when your skill is 2 is kinda
annoying.
