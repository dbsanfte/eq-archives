You might create a social macro with the lines:
/tar a
/pause 3
/loot

And call that macro like "Loot" and hotkey it. The first line will
target most any non-named corpse (e.g. an orc warrior), pause for 0.3
seconds (adjust for lag) to let EQ target the corpse, and then bring up
the loot window. It will work even if the corpse fell inside something
and you can't mouse click on it, you just have to be close enough. I
use it all the time.

For named or any odd npc, you could type, for example, /tar gor (to
target Gornit either the mob, though it's unlikely you'd need to, or
it's corpse).

With the Loot macro, you can stay in OOB view and loot up. The only
time it may fail is when you don't fully loot a corpse or if there is a
live npc very close by.

For targetting, you can use the F8 key (maybe set to cycle through
npcs) and use the targetting ring. I didn't think much of the
targetting ring when it was first introduced (what me need a visible
ring on the ground around the npc??!!) but I swear by it now. There are
times when that won't work too well, but then you'd have problems
anyway and should be in first person view.

Good Luck.
