Here's a question: why the hell are you dying in LOIO? Your target is
snared, and if not, you are SOWed. If you get into trouble, why are you
expecting some group to help you? If you are soloing, then zone when you
get into trouble.

If you are in the game for the interaction, then join a group. In LOIO,
as a druid, you could pretty much form a group with any other class and
hunt. I had great success duoing my druid with my friend's rogue there,
fear kiting sabretooths and using the old DS for anything I couldn't
fear. Pretty easy exp, actually. 

I'm not sure why so many people have problems in LOIO; I never do, even
when it's at peak capacity in the 120's. I have a feeling it has to do
with people crowding around the 4 pillar area and not getting out to the
rest of the zone.
