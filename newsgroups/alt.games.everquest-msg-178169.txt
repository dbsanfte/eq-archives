Giving that single counter example does NOT contradict the previous
poster's claim (rarely != never).  To go further, anybody with broad
experience in developing, delivering, or deploying large software
systems, or managing any of these processes, will know that the
statement you replied to is in fact true, and your assertion that
it is "Not true" is itself false.  Having seen this in a glance, the
only purpose I could infer from your claim that your counter example
proved your "Not true" assertion was that system you mention in your
counter example is equivalent to the system that is EQ.  I responded
to this by debunking it.

Perhaps.  But your post and the follow-up I'm replying to here are
still idiotic.  Given your apparent native intelligence I have to
assume that you are an idiot by choice, and in my book that makes
you well and truely deserving of rudeness until and unless you
abandon your idiocy.  If you were a colleague I had to work with or
for I would confine myself to mentioning your idiocy to one or two
trusted friends (who work elsewhere), but since we're arguing semi-
anonymously in a public forum about a game I'm more than pleased to
confront you with it.

Please tell me, exactly what value does SOE place on it?  In dollars
and cents, and more importantly, relative to all of the other expenses
associated with providing the service.  What's that?  You haven't the
first clue?  I thought so.
