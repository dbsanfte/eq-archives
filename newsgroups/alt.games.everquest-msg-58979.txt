I kind of do feel superior to the bottom-posters.

I actually remember the content of the post I read 3 seconds earlier. If I
forget something, I scroll down and reread the original post (if it was a
short post - hopefully no one is quoting a 3K rant). I will occasionally
<snip>, but I'm afraid that sometimes <snip>ing can be used to take the
original quote out of context.

I was taught to read from top-to-bottom. I want the newest information to be
read first, so I look at the top of the post.

Most (if not all) websites that have updated news pages place the newest
information at the top (like Alakhazam).

When I reply to a personal e-mail I place my content at the top, so the
recipient sees it first.

Some of the groups I use where top-posting is the norm, and always has been:

alt.music.ween
rec.toys.action-figures
alt.music.roger-waters

The computer NGs I read have a mixture of top and bottom posters.

However, I'm all for folks doing what they feel comfortable with. I feel
that trying to change relatively inconsequential behavior traits to be a
waste of time (and it annoys the pig).

Finally, OE is an excellent basic newsreading app. It doesn't have a lot of
bells and whistles, but I read NGs for information and OE displays that
information quite nicely.
