I don't see any (over) excitement, Sue posted a link and explained what it
was.
She does this often, I read all the posts and as the posts are a brief
synopsis I choose whether or not I want to read the article.
Your previous comment made little sense to me, I saw no attempt to start a
gender discussion. Just a post with a link to public news on the game we
play.
