Thats a sound approach to the "wayfarer's spread out over 6 zones" solution,
although not one I'll be trying anytime soon, since the patch I'm LD about
75% of the time on zoning.  Still, that usually gets fixed fairly quickly
when it happens, after which, zoning around to advertise to all waiting
groups makes some sense.  Of course the LFG flag or better the LFG/P tool
would be even better... if people adopt it for the purpose.

I also didn't do this because I was interested in just what an LFG flag would
actually get me, my time was short enough that I was soon unable to actually
group if anyone did ask, so I didn't want to be very active in advertising
that I was LFG.
