How can it not be at the expense of the entire group. If a suboptimal 
tank is tanking, its to the expense of the entire group, almost by 
definition.

And it leads to the question, what if you have a 44th cleric without kei 
in the group, and he's doing his best, but there is downtime, and a 46th 
cleric with kei starts ooc-lfg... do you drop your existing clr and pick 
up the new one? If you don't its at the expense of everyone in the group 
(except the displaced cleric).

What if both clerics are 46th, and one is a crack addict, and the other 
prefers to play with the tools available within the group, without 
relying on picking up hilev buffs every couple hours. Or if your warrior 
is questing his way up, and only has looted/quested weapons vs bazaar 
junk. These personal choices are all ultimately 'at the expense of the 
entire group' too... at least from the perspective of maximizing efficiency.

An extreme application of that logic leads us to decide that nobody 
should group with new players, who are underskilled and undereqipped -- 
unless they patronize a plat seller and gear up in the bazaar, otherwise 
their under performance will be at the expense of the entire group... is 
that really the road we want to take?

Its nearly to the point where EQ is like fishing with dynamite, and if 
anyone on your boat pulls out a rod and bait and says, "hey, lets just 
fish with this and drink beer for a while!" you kick him off the boat in 
favour of someone else ready to go with a case of dynamite.

And once somebody figures out how to just drain the lake, and use a 
bulldozer to collect the fish even the dynamite fishermen won't be welcome.
