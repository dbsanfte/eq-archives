In the case of the Iceclad boat, as stated elsewhere in this thread, they
have a mighty boat wizard who will just tp you to the Iceclad dock from the
NRo dock, he is the new NPC near Frankel in NRo.  His counterpart is on the
Iceclad dock, and he will tp you to the NRo dock.  I would assume that this
is due to the current Helloween stuff going on, not sure.  So, until it is
changed back, don't wait for the boat, just say "I want a ride" to the new
Gnome NPC.
