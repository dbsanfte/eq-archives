Well, since nobody took up my suggestion and started a genuine FLAME post...
I'm going to do so and never read this post again.  I'm also going to point
some things out that the flamers (Dark Tyger specifically) might fnd
enlightening (as far as their subconscious hopes and dreams) in the course
of the flame war that I'm sure will rapidly ensue from the following post :)

I'm using Dark Tyger as an example since he seems to be the worst, but this
applies to all flamers here and, DT, I really don't have anything against
you specifically except that you're damn annoying.

You know... when I first read some of your posts I thought that, although
they tended to be stupid, people were kind of blowing the whole thing out of
proportion.  I actually felt some sort of sympathy for you, in the way that
one might feel sympathy for the local retarded kid.  And you'd get so upset
when people would reply and say nasty things that for a little while I
wondered why everyone was so cruel to you, and didn't simply ignore you, as
I have up to this point.

But I've since concluded that deep down, you feel that being universally
hated is preferable to being universally ignored.  In the words of Neil
Gaiman (one of my personal heroes), "Notoriety is not as good as fame, but
it's a long shot better than obscurity!"

...

Your posts imply a simple lack of understanding of the things that upset NG
posters.  They do this so effectively that the casual observer might
actually believe that the cause is, in fact, a lack of this understanding.
However, a more consistent observer will notice that although a certain type
of post causes reactions, and although those reactions appear to be quite
offensive and incomprehensible to you, you repeat the mistake, not once, not
twice, nor even three, four, or five times, but so many times that if this
hypothetical observer were to try to count these repeated 'blunders', he
would run out of named numbers.  One might simply assume that the basic
learning faculty posessed by most humans is absent in your case, but your
ability to refer to past events would not bear out this theory on closer
examination.

The only conclusion is that although pain is unpleasant, you would prefer
that others slowly mutilate and torture you than that they not realize you
exist.  Perhaps you're actually a masochist, finding pain pleasant and
titillating.

... takes a deep breath, winds down slowly, and falls flat on his face...

Ya.  So.  The point is, I hate flamers.  I really hate Dark Tyger.  The only
people I don't hate are people who have something other than cabbage between
their ears.  But hey, everyone has a right to have fun, so... have fun!
I'll just pretend stupidity doesn't exist... and if there's anything to
solipsism, maybe that will make all the stupid people keel over and die.
One hopes.
