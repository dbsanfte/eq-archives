Are there certain races that flourish (experience-wise) in certain zones?
For instance, I have a 7 Barb Shaman that gets loads of xp in Everfrost even
at times from green /cons, but after moving to BlackBurrow most blues don't
seem to be giving xp. Does this seem logical? I am looking at takeing him to
CB or Mistmore to see how things go there. Also, bored on Antonica, my
Halfling Rogue is considering making the trip to LoIO. Any opinions or ideas
on this? I'm not trying to power level or anything, but I would like to get
a decent level of xp for the effort put forth in battle. Also looking for a
change of scenery.

Thanks in advance.
