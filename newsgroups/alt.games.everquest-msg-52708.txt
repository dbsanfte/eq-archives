Theres a big difference between losing GEBs and your epic, as happened
to Ferkl on Cazic when he had a sword is his hand and tried to loot
his (no drop of course) epic when his inventory was full.  When your
inventory is full and you try to loot a no drop item from your own
corpse it poofs.  Bad coding, gms just say tough.
