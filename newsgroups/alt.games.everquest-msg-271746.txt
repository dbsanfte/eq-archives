Get yourself a copy of a program called Nano Nanny....it helps you plan out
your implants and even lets your print out a list of 'clusters' you need to
buy if making your implants from scratch.

If you are making a set of implants for yourself, start familiarising
yourself with all the AO help sites. Several of them have guides on getting
implants far above your level in, so that at level 25 you can wear level
50ish implants.
