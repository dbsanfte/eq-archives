Greetings, all.

Now, I know these probably aren't hugely important in the vast scheme of
things, but they're things I've been wondering about.

Since signing back onto EQ the other week I've played about three sessions
so far and I've noticed some changes have been made aside from the very
groovy cosmetic updates.

Firstly - what do the Priests of Discord do now?  Since I didn't start with
a Tome of Order & Discord (or whatever it was called), yet they still ask me
to hand it to them.  I wasn't planning on doing so - but it just highlighted
the fact that I haven't seen any red names knocking around, either.  Are
there no player killers on non-PK servers now?

Secondly - have the noticeboards in pubs and inns and such places been taken
out?  I used to like reading through those and they were sometimes handy for
leaving messages for my friends.  I can't seem to find any any more...

Finally - I'm now seventh level.  (Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to
me, etc...)   But I've noticed that when I die, I seem to respawn at my bind
point with all my equipment and weapons and money, and when I wander back to
my corpse (as much for curiosity as anything else) I find it's lying there
butt nekkid (ish) with nothing to benefit me from looting it.  What's the
drill with corpses these days?  Given my innate skills at sneakery, I used
to be able to make some use of myself doing corpse runs into dangerous
places - am I redundant on this score now?

Sorry about all that.  Norrath's a whole new world and I'm still finding my
feet.  Any help would be appreciated, ta.
