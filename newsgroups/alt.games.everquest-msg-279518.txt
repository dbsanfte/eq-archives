Not sure if you can all help me, but why not?

I am moving to Europe (Britain) in the next couple of months.  I am
looking at high end raiding guilds on Antonius Bayle should I decide to
leave my current server.  I'm in a high end guild there that raids PST
3 days a week, but I doubt I can raid their times once I move.  I am
going to try like hell to raid with them, though, after the move.
However, if I find raiding difficult, I know I will have to move.  As
it stands, I'm just putting out feelers about Antonius Bayle high end
guilds.

I'm a bit up in the air about server transferring.  I do love my guild,
am absolutely loyal to them, but I also like to raid.  It's a huge
decision for me as I've been with my current guild for more than 3
years.

For Antonius Bayle, I've come across Darkwind, Raging Fury and Tide as
high end guilds.  Well, at least from looking at EQ Rankings.  However,
when I went to check their sites they all raid at least 5 days a week.
Is there a guild that is high end on Antonius Bayle that doesn't raid 5
days a week?  Should I decide to server transfer and any of them need
my class, I am curious about the culture of the 3 guilds.  What are
personalities like, are they mellow, which guild has the best rep on
the server, etc.  I wonder if that makes sense?  :)  Furthermore, how
would one describe the personality of the average AB player?

FWIW, I'm a level 70 cleric and am flagged all the way up to Anguish.
I've got 1060 AAs and my epic 2.0.

I hope I didn't bore you all to death.

Thanks for reading this far.
