In that situation I am guessing that the beastlord is producing around 40- 
50% of the damage it is capable of.  I would guess that a shaman pet 
combined with shaman DOTs
and DD spells would prove more effective, not to mention
the superior buffs and heals.

To maximise the DPS of a Beastlord you need to melee,
position yourself and your pet properly, keep your pet buffed, slow, 
debuff, and use DD spells.

If you play half the class, why not play a pure caster?
