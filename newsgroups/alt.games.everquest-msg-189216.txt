As much as people will complain about the costs of smithing, to be honest it
isn't that bad.  Check out eqtraders.com for everything tradeskill.  If you
farm your own leather paddings, you only lose money on failures for making
fine plate.  After that Shadowscream is the cheapest way to go.  It involves
hours upon hours of farming, but is very cheap to make.  The downside to
acrylia armor is windstones, they are neither cheap to buy nor easy to farm
in quantity.  I recommend checking out Monual's guide on the eqtraders
message board.
