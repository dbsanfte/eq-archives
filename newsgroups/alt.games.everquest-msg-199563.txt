Graeme, as much as I enjoy your posts - please stop feeding the trolls.  I
play a wizard as well as an enchanter, and Uber is embarassing me.
I've just hit 63 with my wizard and have none of the PoP 63 spells yet - but
my bread-and-butter nuke, Draught of Ro, is far preferable to my 60 nukes
(Ice Spear and Sunstrike) in both casting time and mana efficiency - and
that's with an ID III item.

If I could offer two pieces of advice to a new wizard - visit the Graffe
message boards, and killfile UberNuke until you learn what's true in his
posts and what is sheer entertainment.
