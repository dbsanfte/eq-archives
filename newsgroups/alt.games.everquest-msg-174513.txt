Five song twists are doable in Old, Kunark, and Vel. Have little luck
with them in Luc or PoP. The effects drop about 1 or 2 seconds before
it reapplies but this ok if that fifth song is really needed. Four
song twists are standard in lower lag zones and reaching in higher lag
areas. If you cant do 3 dont expect much success as a bard in any zone
raids being a possible exception.

Post 30 you will want to use amp to get that kick it gives Singing.
Many songs are near useless without the instrument bonus. Learn to
swap instruments it must be in your slot when the song ENDS not at the
begining so you have 3-4 seconds to do this.
