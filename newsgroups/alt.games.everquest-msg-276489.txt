We've done things like races (by any means possible, until I used evac - that
loophole was closed fairly quickly!), hunts for specific drops from monsters,
and ball games using scarecrows (two opposing teams try to drag a scarecrow to
their side of the field without killing it - mentoring would be quite useful
here to make sure that things like taunts are equivalent, or maybe disallow
taunts). And the usual things like quest groups and heritage groups.
