I sort of agree...but then again, other posters pointed out the cost of
bandwidth, etc., and how high they must be. Which I agree with.

Somebody has to host the content, don't they? It may as well be well arranged

>Actually eventually it just won't be around to use

I agree here, too. Somebody made a comment about how it was "Killing itself
