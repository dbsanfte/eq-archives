First off....Welcome!

All of the files/updates you need to play the game are downloaded when
you login.

Essentials....

1. You have to use at least one training point when you acquire a new
skill (for example at level 3 monks get Safe Fall...You will not be
able to use/improve the skill until you go to a monk trainer and spend
at least 1 point training it.) Some skills do not require a training
point, but your safest bet is to train 1 point in each one till you
know more about the game.

2. Don't beg for items or money! Other players hate and loathe
beggars. It is almost always ok to ask people questions and for help.
Let them know that you are new to the game, so that they don't make
any assumptions about your knowledge level.

3. Take your time and enjoy the journey. EQ has been around for almost
4 years now. You won't be able to learn/know everything right away.
Don't be overly anxious to level or acquire gear. It all takes time,
and it's not a race. You are playing against the game environment not
other people. It's ok to be a "newbie" we all were once :) 

Here is a list of Internet web sites that you will find EXTREMELY
useful.

www.eqatlas.com (maps for almost every zone in the game with landmarks
and information on hunting)

www.monkly-business.com (THE monk site for EQ)

http://eq.castersrealm.com (news, information for all classes)
