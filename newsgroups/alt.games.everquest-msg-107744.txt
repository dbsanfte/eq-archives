Nor would it be fair to hold the fact that you don't get powerleveled
against those of us who don't.

I can't think of a way to say this without it sounding harsh, so please
understand that I don't mean it that way....

The fact that you don't take advantage of the benefits of your class, and
use them to your advantage does not entitle you to additional benefits.  If
a warrior complained about the lack of soloing ability, he'd be told to play
a bard instead.  It's not our fault that you choose not to solo, even though
your class is one of the best at it (despite what hughes thinks).

As I said in a different post, a little tweaking may be in order, but I
think druids are better off than most classes, as a whole.  Oh, and my guild
has three druid mains, and only one cleric main.  I'd love to see druids
made better healers, but I don't think it's appropriate.
