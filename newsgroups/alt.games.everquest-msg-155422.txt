Actually, 60% can be too high if the nukers don't have aggro control spells.
In Halls of Testing, against the pit mobs, I found that if I nuked full out
at 50% (level 55 Wizard), I could get enough aggro to get summoned.  I
wasn't throwing in Concussion because I thought that there would be no way
that I could get aggro if I waited that long.

(And since it was an AoE mob, so the melees had pushed it up into the
corner, so casters could hide around the corner when not casting, so as to
not get torn up by the AE, when it summoned me, it put me behind that damn
firepot, so I needed to be CoH'ed out after fight.  Normally, that would be
funny...except that earlier, before anyone told me that you get stuck if you
go behind the firepots, I had went back there between fights, and had had to
be CoH'ed out, so everyone made extra fun of me the second time).
