Bard haste in the target group will not stack with enchanter haste.

Normal bard haste is the same as spell haste.  While you may see the icons
stack, this is because the bard haste songs also include various stat boosts,
which remain active.  Only the best haste % will be used however.

At level 50, bards get the song Melody of Evadj (or something along those
lines) which does give a haste which stacks on top of chanter haste... or for
that matter on top of their own haste line.  This is, however a whopping 5%
haste.  Oh, and if you have somehow managed to get equipment haste plus spell
haste that gets your haste capped out, this haste is immune to that cap, so you
get the full (although miniscule) effect.

It isn't until 52 that bards get a special haste worth singing, Battlecry of
the Vah Shir, which is just like melody, only its 15% extra bonus (and non
capped) haste. Much to my surprise (wasn't paying attention) this song also
seems to have a duration of a minute or two, so if you can spare the song slot
for it, it won't really degrade your ability to put up other song functions
