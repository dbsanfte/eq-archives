Thinking of making a second character just to play around with
occasionally.  I have heard that Iskar are a lot of fun and would like
to find out for myself.  

My playing style is 'casual'.  A couple hours a night at best.  My
only char at present is a 40ish Barb Shaman who I will probably spend
most of my time playing.  99% of the time I'm a soloer and like to
roleplay, tradeskill every bit as much if not more than hunt.  I
refuse to twink, if I make another character, he will be buying
equipment with money he earned.

I realize there is no 'best' but would like opinions on pros and cons
of the differrent Iskar classes.
