So giving it another whirl and I still find the same things disturbing.

People just die and /release and go elsewhere. I was grouped with some
people and it ticked me off. The penalty for death is way too trivial.

The interface - sucks - no where near as customisable as EQ's
Heres a good example of a custom EQ skin, you need to know XML so I wont be
making any.

Still no food ingame, I want food/drinks that add to my stats

Linear zoning still buggy. With 512 ram and under Windows XP on a 1300 Duron
with Geforce3 Ti200 this thing still chugs. It works fine when your in one
area but as you move around and the engine loads other parts of the worlds
it was not pretty. Either that or my hdd is fragmented something bad.

People fucking with my mobs. This pissed me to know end. Little gimps coming
to my mob, hitting it a bit then sitting down to get the xp that I worked
for.

Oh and EnB blows goats, I can't believe I wasted 1 gig on beta on that game
:)
