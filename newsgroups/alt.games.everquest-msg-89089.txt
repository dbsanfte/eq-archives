I would think a warrior-shammy-druid combo would be great,  2 healers, nukers,
sow. speed (awesome), ports, all races that are not evil for maximum travel
possibilities.  and if you ever want to add a forth member to the group you
have a PL team to die for, shammy and druid.  Shammy adds pets too for melee.

I would also think that if you are 3  then start off with chars that you can
use later to PL some alts to use depending on situation.  You will have 3
accounts, using 3-4 slots each dedicated to your group, you could cover just
about anything and maximize playing enjoyment.
