With the zoning pets, mage pets are likely to be at least as well buffed 
as shaman pets, and start out significantly superior.  Mage pets are also 
more likely to have mage pet toys.  I do buy the toys, when they are 
available, which is not always, when I plan on seriously using my pet.  I 
just know that I've watched both mage and necro pets tank mobs that my 
pet would not stand up to for more than a very few rounds at best.  The 
OOW SK pet will outtank the OOW shaman pet, given equivalent gear and 
buffs, quite handily.

No question, the shaman pet is useful, I use mine a lot for xping, not 
farming.
