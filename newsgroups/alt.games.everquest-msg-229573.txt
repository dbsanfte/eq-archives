AS can I, But if you read what I was saying, In this group before the patch
I could hold agro with nothing more than taunt and a Darkness to pull.  My
cleric through a heal on me at 25% mob health as he normaly does. By that
time I am normaly the only thing that the mob cares about.  Since I had been
able to hold agro so well in the area that we were fighting without the
Terror line, I didn't have any of it up.

One thing I can do is hold agro.  I am the primary agro machine for my
guild.  When anyone else is MA the Nukers wait till 40 - 50 % health on the
mob.  When I am the MA they go at it at it when I call for Melle assist.
Only once In a large battle did I loose agro, and that was because that
berson NUked before I called assist. I know how to use my Agro spell line
efectivly, if not Mana waistfully. =)

:  Now that you get a message telling you when it works and when it
:  doesn't, you are more aware of how rarely it does, and you can add some
:  interesting insight if it is as dependant on the level of the target as
:  it seems... but you'll want to do some rigorous experimenting and log
:  file parsing to back this observation up.

YOu are corect we now get a message when it DOESN'T work, but we always got
one when it did.  Ie. "You taunt {Trash} to ignore others and attack you!"
I have a macro that Tuants, Begs, and Disarms.  I have parsed the file
before to look for fail's by looking for when the Taunt sucsessful message
was before the beg /disarm message, and when it wasn't.  90% was a little
optimistic.  In reality it was a lot closser to 80%. ( 82.4 i think, but
memory is failing me right now)

My point in this is that just using Taunt, agro control has been diminished.
IS taunt the primary taunt for Knites.   No, but it used to help.

Here is some evidance for you.  Same mob that is alwais the same level.
Vraptin in WW. always level 53.  First fight i was lvl 51, second fight i am
lvl 54.

First fight lasts 2minutes 37 seconds. I sucsessfully taunted Vraptin 19
times and failed 4.  This was on December 5th of this year.

Second fight lasted 2 minutes 33 seconds. I sucsessfuly taunted Vraptin 3
times, failed 17 times.  This was December 21st
