Simple, there's a canned message you get when you try to log in, AFTER 
you've downloaded any patch messages.  Why not, when patch is complete, 
put a downloadable file in that changes what that generic message is. 
Put one in immediately when the patch begins, saying "patch is in 
session" (none of this "it might be" crap), then when finished, put a 
second one in that says "patch for 7/17 complete, any problem you 
experience logging in is not due to a patch in session"

AND I can easily connect to the SOE site at any time during a patch... 
but they don't post the information there when a patch is complete either.

Well, I dunno about that, but the SOE website (or maybe it was Verant 
back then) used to tell you how many people were on for each server.  If 
it was more than 10, you knew the server was up, under that, it was 
probably a DEV testing the patch out (hard as it is to believe anyone 
actually does that)
