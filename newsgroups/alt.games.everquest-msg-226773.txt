Heehee
You'd better get used to it!

I have had a rash of deaths lately when my heal laned 1/10th of a second too
late - event to the point I was releaved it went off but it infact did not
hit in time.

I have found at higher levels that a smoothly running group with steady
predictable heals can go bad at any time.....The most common cause of this
is Virtue fading mid battle and the tank not telling me (I need to know if
they have 1k less hp).....next is slow not hitting when it has been every
other time and the slower not indicating they are having resists.......then
just plain bad luck - the mobs have a string of quad that hit each time mid
CH and the tank goes down too quick.

I have to admit there have been a handful (no more than 5) deaths that have
been soley my fault....one of which we got a new group member with almost an
idential name to the MT and slotted into the same function-key spot the MT
was previously in, I could not figure out why my heals were not affecting
him.

And sometimes in a bad situation you have to be brutal and descide who is
going to die (usually the ranger or the wiz who got agro) if you have to
keep the MT alive or the chater for crowd control. I have done this a few
times and the group was greatful that the tank and the chater lived so we
didnt have to do a corpse run.
