Heh....well, probably thats the class I played before :) BUT it has
been about a year and well, I guess I could try something else. Real
reason is, that when I had my necro, I tried several times to start a
alt of a different class but to be honest, I dident like any class as

I will probably experam,ent till I find one I like...but back to my
origional questions.....
