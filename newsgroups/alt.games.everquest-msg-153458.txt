I took this from one of the boards a few months back.....good story.



I was invisible and running through the Karanas one day when I noticed a
young gnome near the gypsy camp. He was fighting a lion and though it looked
like he would win the battle, being a fellow gnome, I decided to help the
guy out.

I targeted the lion, clicked on my mesmerize spell, then *started* to type:
"I'm mesmerizing the lion for you." I got as far as: "I'm " when I
remembered that I had replaced my mesmerize spell with an Area of Effect
mesmerize spell... and that I was standing next to an NPC enchantress. Gulp.

My movement keys are mapped to "w a s d" so I frantically stabbed at my
keyboard, trying to MOVE and interrupt the spell.

I forgot that I was in typing mode.

The gypsy enchantress didn't like my attempt to mezz her so she promptly
charmed me and made me go after the gnome I had been trying to *save*. I
watched in horror as my peace-loving character, knife flailing like a crazed
sushi chef, chased the little guy down and stabbed him to death.

I found my victim later and apologized profusely... I even gave him a nice
weapon and a piece of armor. He was great about it, and laughed when I told
him what happened.

He said he didn't know WHAT was going on. One minute he was fighting a lion,
the next minute a strange gnome appeared out of NOWHERE, announced: "I'm
wwwaaaddd", then sliced him up like Freddy Krueger.
