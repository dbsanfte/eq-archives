You can download the file and play it on your desktop.  Here's the URL to
the 30 second commercial:

http://everquestonlineadventures.station.sony.com/media/EQOA_ad_30.mov

I found this by clicking on the link to go to the page that tries to play it
as an embedded movie, and then simply selected "view source" in my browser
(well, actually, I clicked the mouse button and moved the mouse left, down,
right, down, left, since I have a browser that supports mouse gestures).

Only the commercial require this.  The page that plays the wipeout movie has
a link to download it, and the two other non-commercials are links to the
movie files.
