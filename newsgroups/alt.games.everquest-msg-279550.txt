	The very fact I'm unhappy with is Everquest is *two* games with two 
separate groups of players. So far your arguments for supporting this 
phenomena have ranged from "because it is" through "but naked people can 
kill level 35 giants" to "DoN gear is equal to Elemental and Time Gear 
so it's ok".

	I still don't think it's ok that there's such a gulf between raiders 
and single-groupers. I think it's fine that there is a gap in gear 
between the two, but it shouldn't prevent the two groups from 
interacting as much as it does. I have no idea why you support it. Are 
you totally unaware that it's a problem? Do you think it's not a 
problem? Or do you think its a problem that can't be fixed? I don't know 
what you think because you've taken all three viewpoints at different times.

	Yes, I'm not competing with guys in Anguish gear. I don't see them. I 
still have the same habit of seeking pickup groups when my guild don't 
have a spot for me, and I see the same people doing it, only now I have 
an unfair advantage over most of them.

	This debate was about the gap between raider and non raider gear, not 
the gap between Time and Anguish gear.

	A lazy weekend? Any Schmoe? That there is 18 creators. My record for a 
weekend is 12, and believe me that wasn't a lazy weekend for me, and 
really, I'm not 'any schmoe' either. What's yours?

	It isn't anywhere close to time gear. It takes two augs to catch up in 
HP and is left behind in every other area.

	It isn't anywhere close to Elemental gear. It can overtake Ele gear 
with hitpoints if you add two pure-hp augs to it and only one to the EP 
piece, but the EP piece still has almost twice the AC, better resists 
and an effect.

	Your assumption is not correct, at least for this tank.

	KT and Yxxta, whether it suits your argument or not, are still areas 
where raiders might go to single group, but single groupers do not.

	MPG has a few single groupers in it, but not the trials. Pickup MPG 
trials generally just don't happen (I've yet to see one)

	I bet if I had my old group of bezerker maniacs around I could grind 
out a few Fear trials and get the crimson choker. I don't :) I've only 
heard of one group in my guild doing MPG trials, and they're the group 
of raid leaders and so forth who don't include me in their various 
single-group exploits.

	Yxxta eh. Want to do an experiment? Go anon so your guild tag is 
hidden, stand in PoK and /ooc "taking a group to Yxxta to get my neck 
piece" and see how many takers you get. For extra points, let them know 
that your tank has uber DoN gear. For 1000 points, explain to those who 
laugh at that how DoN gear is better than Elemental and that they should 
think of your DoN tank as an EP or perhaps Time tank.

	Rotfl! Do you have any comprehension how RARE that item is? You do not 
go to WoS _planning_ to get one of the 'trash' rares. I got myself a 
couple of levels and probably 50AA's in that place, and I have yet to 
see the Blue Flame Necklace anywhere but Alla.

	That are technically but not really acquirable with a pre elemental 
tank, and easily acquirable with an Anguish geared tank.

	Or, in the case of the Blue Flame Necklace, a little too rare to count on.

	And there you're not factoring in the EP gear upgrades during the 
'months' leading up to the three hours, all of which help trivialise DoN's.

	Yes, my point was that your point, if one is discernable to anyone in 
the 'naked monks in rathe' side-trip, was a red herring.

	I do believe that statement, its why they don't let you transfer from a 
blue server to a PvP server.

	So he's actually a Time tank, his enchanter does most of the work, but 
he can 3-box Vxed and Tipt so this... establishes that anyone can do it? 
I'm still trying to guess at your point.

	We all know that.

	The problem is that I can't discern any meaning once you add the 
brackets bit, because it de-quantifies everything. Anything you can 
two-box, regardless of your gear level (so anything you can two-box in 
storebought leather armour) should be doable by a group that has a clue, 
no matter their gear level. Totally agree with that.

	Now then, you add '(within reason, again understanding the concept of 
"place")'. This introduces two nebulous undefined facets to your 
statement, one being what Faned regards as "within reason" and the other 
being Faned's concept of "place".

	It may've been over the top and overly broad, but as far as I saw, it 
wiped out the iksar monk twink phenomena at my level (at the time) 
literally overnight, and that was a good thing. From what you're saying 
above, it probably wasn't aimed at raid-level monks since you say they 
weren't actually tanking at the raid level.

	I _am_ saving my DKP for something worth spending it on, having spent a 
third of it on that neck piece, and given that I'm unlikely to be 
convincing a group of my guildies to grind trials of fear until I get a 
crimson choker, the Time piece (which is still the better piece) was the 
right thing to buy :)
