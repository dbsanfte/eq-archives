I've made a macro for assisting the tank but it stops working and when I
look at it has changed.
The macro is as follows:

/g Assisting %t
/assist %t

But after a while ,mainly if I switch tanks, it stops working so I'll open
it up and the macro will look like this:

/g Assisting %t
/assist Gordox

Gordox being a tank I had been assisting.
So what gives?

Thanks for any help.
