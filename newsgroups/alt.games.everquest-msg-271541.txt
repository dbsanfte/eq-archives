While I have no stake in your play style, I really must encourage you to 
play the game into the 50s at least. Trust me: 50 is as far from 70 as 1 
is from 50. But at the 50s all the classes are well defined and the 
range of places you can go and things you can do are substantial.

If you've played DiabloII imagine playing characters to 25 and then 
remaking them... the characters simply don't come into their own until 
around 35 or 40... EQ is similiar in that regard.

*AS A WARRIOR*

Several other classes... Bard, Enchanter, Druid, Necro all can do very 
well solo, some even get better at it as they level up. And several 
other classes can do it in a pinch. Warrior is probably the 2nd worst 
solo class in the game.

Honestly... shoot for the 50's game.

Yes. Some missed it. But many have seen it before.

And your right Warriors are simple. Unfortunately in EQ a warrior is 
good at one thing: Taking Damage. They do it better than any other 
class. That makes them very valuable in groups and especially valuable 
in raids, but utterly painful to solo. Because, while they are so 
excellent at taking damage, they are dismal at healing it afterwards, 
and quite mediocre at dealing it. They also have no utility. And its 
utility that enables classes to solo.

A jack of all trades but master of none is better suited for soling than 
a master of a single one.

True. However, if I may ask a pointed question: So what? What have you 
got to lose by engaging a steeper learning curve?

That was ultimately caused by your own lack of knowledge of the player 
conventions.

You say that now. Perhaps once you have seen more of the game for 
yourself you'll think differently.

Tear any warrior in half. *Any* warrior.

I don't think you've grasped just how limited you will be with respect 
to viable hunting areas. Its not like there are 10 zones and you'll be 
able to pick 4 of them.

All dungeons beyond the first couple mobs will be out of the question, 
and that's only if the first couple mobs are singles that don't run. 
Most outdoor zones will limit you to only a couple places where you'll 
be able find a mob you can single pull, and kill without risk of adds.

Then why the outburst about downtime. Whats more relaxing than watching 
the Norrathian flowers grow while you wait for 1000s of hit points to 
regenerate. :p

I'm basing it more on EQ knowledge gleaned than absolute time. There is 
*very* little about EQ that one can learn soloing warriors to their 
teens.

/boggle

What do you mean except no taunt? What do you need taunt for? Taunt is 
useful exclusively in a group situation. It has no solo use at all.

It caps around 50 at 9th. You're barely halfway there. At skill level 20 
it only heals 5hp per bandage. At 50 its 12.
