What if you 'save' the player after the pet is dead?  
Then the mage or necro is just sitting safely.  You can take the
spawns or leave them for others.  No player death involved.  You could
even offer to replace the components so the player could recast the
pet.  Not your fault if they won't/can't accept the trade while AFK.
