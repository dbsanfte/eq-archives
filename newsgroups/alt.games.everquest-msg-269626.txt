What if the challenge can be overcome by simply walking around it? Do 
you -often- fight difficult risky mobs you can trivially skip? Once 
maybe, sure... but -often-?

Precisely... with a 96% rez in the package people will do anything... 
because the death penalty has been effectively mitigated. So -who- does 
does the death penalty punish?

1) The endgame raider? No. They may die a lot while learning the latest 
encounter, but the 96% rez is always just around the corner. 

2) The Powergamer in PL guilds, in PL camps and in PL zones? No. They 
simply virtually never die. And if they do they either have a cleric 
handy or are getting xp back so fast it simply doesn't matter to have 
the -odd- death.

3) The single group player, at high level, doing high level content? Not 
really, most people at this stage have a high level cleric bot or friend 
if one doesn't happen to be in the group... and if they -don't- they 
simply won't do anything -that- challenging.

4) The new player, at midgame, doing single group content outside of PL 
zones? Yes... the death penalty hits him hardest. He doesn't have a high 
level cleric bot, and even a cleric in group only offers a 30-50% rez, 
and if he's fighting in non PL zones even a 50% rez might amount to a 
loss of an hour+ of play, and an unrezzed death might cost them their 
entire evening. Multiple unrezzed deaths could set them back a week. And 
you really can't buy a rez in Dalnir, or Infected Paw, or ToFS...

Why on earth would you want to put a serious 'death penalty' in a gmae 
that only effects newer players doing something challenging?
