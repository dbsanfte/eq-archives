What sort of class is best for a character who just wants to adventure
around the world, exploring but taking part in combat and being able to
survive on his lonesome. I know Everquest is lanted towards group play, but
I bet theres one or two classes that really have the edge on solo play?

I cant see my 9th level warrior/human even getting close to being able to
solo explore around the world. He needs some sort of healing backup. Maybe
Im wrong though?
