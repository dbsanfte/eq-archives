Well yes, but I have all these caveats; is it capturing all their damage 
as well as it is mine?  If I looked at their parse of the same fight, 
maybe they'd only show a fraction of my DPS and all of their own.

OK , AOW fight (which we wiped at 37% on)

Assuming the top mage also had the top pet, I still came in fourth*. 
Without regard to pets, I still came in eighth, and one of our other Sk 
came in twelfth and probably significantly higher if I could figure out 
which pet belonged to him.

My pet alone out DPS'd the warriors (who, I have to note, suffered from 
being in front of the mob, and from each only being alive 3/5ths the fight)

I don't bring this up to crow (I do that in guild chat thanks) but 
rather to say that its apparent that much of what I've been lead to 
believe about the SK class is incorrect; we are capable of contributing 
significantly as a DPS class.  I haven't focused on DPS AA, believing 
the popular wisdom that my DPS wasn't significant and 10% more of not 
much wasn't something to worry about; looks like that might be a mistake.

And the pet is a good portion of that DPS.  My pet wasn't even well 
geared or buffed here,  I'd lost one in a previous fight, and this one 
was fresh summoned with only my own haste as a buff, and no gear.

So if I'm not boasting, why post this?  Well, its a heads up; if we're a 
DPS class then we should start acting like one; bid on those haste 
items, look for attack and strength on your gear, look for your highest 
DPS ratio weapon, so on and so forth.

And the pet is a significant one, so do summon him, do get him geared 
up, do get him DPS buffs if you can talk buffers into it, at least focus 
(which has a long duration) and your own haste buff...but to do any of 
this, you MUST get the pet discipline AA and use the pet hold command, 
this is a guild rule for all pets on all raids.  My pet was nearly a 
third of my DPS on this run, thats got to be the best 6AA I've spent ever.

* note that log parsers are often inaccurate and tend to favor the 
person keeping the log; you can miss a portion of other people's hits 
while capturing all of your own.  Therefore, don't take this list as an 
absolute... but its interesting to note that the other 65 SK present 
didn't come up that much lower than I did, leading me to believe that my 
general conclusions are in the right area
