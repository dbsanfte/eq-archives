For soloing with my BL it's about being able to take a few more 
shots from 500+ hitters while Tigger is getting aggro, without
getting low health aggro myself.  HP matters when I solo, at least
as much as when I group.

In groups they matter because my Cleric buddy has SCRM, and his
SE does 3500 HP worth of healing.  I need the extra HP so he doesn't
have to heal me until he will get maximum bang for his buck.
