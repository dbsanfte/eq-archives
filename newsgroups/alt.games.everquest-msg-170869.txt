That statement is a true lie.  If an author devoted as many words to
down-time as he did to action, measured as words vs. time elapsed,
nobody would read his books.  Uninteresting time intervals are glossed
over in literature, weeks and months passing in a couple of paragraphs
or even just part of a sentence is not uncommon.  A night's sleep rarely
merits mention at all.  So your "common element of fantasy literature"
comment is really just a load of crap.  OTOH, the "not fun" comment is
relevent, and has obviously influenced the game developers.
