Depends on your class.  If you are not a puller, or a kiter, then get Run 
1, go back to XPing to about 60, then load up on some AA.  I have found 
that at level 61, I am not at all hindered in getting AAXP yet, 62 would 
probably be ok as well, but much beyond that, without tier 2 planes 
flagging, would get very limiting.
