Sorry missed the original post so replying off georg's lol, there is another
cleric guild in echo caverns (the hidden entry) when you zone in turn right
and it looks like a dead end, click the rock and it opens with several
trainers inside, this is where my de cleric trains. Georg mentioned the wine
quest, do that to build the guard factions (and a few others) then go
slaughter the halflings in nek forest and gather the necklaces (and the
master's head just for a fun clicky halfling illusion mask which is part of
the symbol quests), another way which requires some running is to go to
ogguk or grobb and find the de in the shammie guild area's, she asks you to
deliver a note to Perrin which is a faction quest for the cleric guild (so
the ogre and troll shaman's who worship Inny can do the symbol quests, very
helpfull quest in fixing faction) you may get killed a few times handing the
items in since in most cases invis breaks soon as you open a trade window
but if you do it quickly enough you should be ok. Otherwise, train in echo
caverns (the entry is hidden within a building where #17 is on this map,
turn right when you zone in and you will find the dead end with the clicky
wall)  http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/shadowhavenmap.html
Sorry, no paragraph's come from this computer =p
