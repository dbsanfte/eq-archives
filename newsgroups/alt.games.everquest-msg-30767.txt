Nahh, you'll be fine.
Generally the AoE he uses is that stupid stun AoE or fear.  Once he
tears the KoS person to shreds you'll be find after the fear/stun
wears off.

Of course, the big problem is getting fear *INTO* some giants.  Since
you're non-KOS to CoV, you might be non-KOS to Kromrifs (doubtful) but
you're most likely to be KOS to Kromzek (opposing faction of CoV).
