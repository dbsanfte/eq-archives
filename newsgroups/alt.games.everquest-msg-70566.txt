Verant is supposed to always comment on stuff like this on their message
board.  I think they commented on this particular thing, but I'm running
into the same thing you are...I MAY be zoning faster after caching, but it's
not by more than 20%, and when an average zone time takes 30 seconds on the
Old World and 60 seconds on any of the expansions, I just can't seem to
NOTICE any change unless I get my stopwatch out.

You're AMD too, aren't you?  Verant's too busy "optimizing" EQ for P4 that
we'll have to wait a while. :p
