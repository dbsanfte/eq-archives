    LDoN is worth buying, Jazz. It's a hamster wheel, but it's a fun hamster
wheel. And it's aimed squarely at casual players.

    Gates of Discord is going to be the next big raid expansion. As such,
were I a casual player I'd hold off on buying it until you see exactly what
it offers you. The new class likely won't be worth the cost of the
expansion. What interests me is the promise of 10 new instanced zones. We're
already seeing a radical change in the way EQ works with just Time and LDoN
instanced - an expansion filled with instanced content is wild stuff!
