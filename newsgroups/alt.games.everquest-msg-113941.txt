My two main characters are a wizard and a bard.  I've never
seen a more GENEROUS class than bards.  More senior bards
have given me so much stuff (for no apparent reason) and I've
done the same to more junior bards many, many times.

I do believe that there is a lot of difference between young
bards and more elder bards.  The line of demarcation seems to
be around level 40 to me.
