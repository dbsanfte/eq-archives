I think you were completely in the right, AND were doing him a favor.   You
tried to handle the situation without crying to the babysitters and getting
him in trouble. I'm a brand new newbie, only lvl 10, and even I have the
sense (and awareness on the PN policies) not to train thru other people's
camps. I also agree with the guy who expressed suspicion about the validity
of the GM.  Based on my understanding of the rules, his response doesn't
sound reasonable at all.  I dunno what the policy is on challenging GM's,
but I think in your position I might seek to discuss this with another one.
Or I might just let it go, and stay away from Twinkle-toes.  At any rate,
hope that's the last you see of him!
