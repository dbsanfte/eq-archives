As well it should when you do a patch that, for *everybody* causes you to
disconnect every time you zone, and then fix that with a patch that, for
*everybody* causes you to not even be able to enter the world.

If you were lucky enough to miss that, great.  I give them credit for at
least fixing it quickly.  Fact remains, it took them three tries to get the
game working after the last patch and the stuff that was broken was stuff
that should not have been a problem, would not have been a problem had *one*
person tested it.
