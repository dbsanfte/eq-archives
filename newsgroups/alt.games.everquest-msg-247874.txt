The AAXP bar moves at the same rate as normal XP going from 51 to 52. 
So in that respect, any mob you kill gives you the same experience you
would get at level 51 killing it.  However, I am pretty sure that you
get the experience penalty from killing a light blue mob even if it
would be dark blue to a level 51 character.  So in that respect, there
are some locations where you can get better AAXP at a lower level than
higher.  I believe Fungus Grove is an example, where at 62 all (or
almost) all of the mushrooms are dark blue, but as soon as you level
they start becoming light blue, and it's no longer worth hunting
there.

To me, this is all beside the point, since I prefer the Levels before
AA progression.

In any case, to answer the OP's question, I really like the deep part
of Torgiran Mines (near the Nadox zoneline) for AAXP.  As a Beastlord
it's great, since almost every pull is a single, there are very few
casters (none if you avoid certain areas and know how to get past a
one-way wall without aggroing the mob inside), the runners can't get
too far, and there are several named mobs that can pop.  The normal
mobs give 1-1.5% AAXP per, and the nameds and "mini-named" that can
spawn give 3-4% per.  I'd say about 1 AA/2 hours, but that is
increased by the time it takes to get there and breaks to sell the
vendor trash you pick up.  Maybe not totally fast, but I find it to be
a very nice balance between loot and experience.  For a Beastlord at
least, like I said, dunno how well a wizard will do (although I have
seen a wizard camp one of the named spawns, so obviously he feels he
can do it).

Game on,
