It is possible to have a level 1 running around with an epic weapon
but it would take a fanatic with a great deal of time to waste to do
this and other than show off the weapon, it would be foolish.  This
can be accomplished as follows: You must first get a character up to
the normal epic range(normally 46+) and complete your epic quest. You
then put your epic weapon and all other equipment into your bank
account. Then log out of EQ to the character select screen.  At this
point you must delete the character that has the epic and IMMEDIATELY
(sometimes takes a few minutes for server to release the name) create
a new character with the SAME race and class and the EXACT SAME name.
When your new level 1 character logs on, he will have the same bank
account as the deleted character with all items still in it. Before
trying this with an epic level toon, you can verify it by creating a
toon, getting it to level 2 and trying it.
