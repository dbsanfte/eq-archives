I can only echo other comments.  The dracs will dispell and their DoT means
they don't have to close to melee range to hurt you.  I'd avoid them, but if
you really want to try one out you can usually find several within shouting
distance of the zoneline to the Overthere.  Here's a link to Allakhazam's
entry for the Chromodracs and comments from players:

One nice thing is that given you are prepared to be dispelled by them, once
they land Boil Blood on you you can dispell yourself to get rid of it.
