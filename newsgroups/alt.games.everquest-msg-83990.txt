You're asking us to read your mind...you may not know that, but you are.

Pros & Cons...one is fun, the other isn't quite as fun.

I don't know why you think that necros are considered "soloing gods" when
quite a few classes can solo about as well.  If you want to know what each
class is capable of I really think you should do your own research (ie, read
spell lists) and not ask us to think for you.

If you come back with more specific questions I'll be happy to help.
