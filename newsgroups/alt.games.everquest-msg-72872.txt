Here was the odd thing- none of the files copied from the cds were read
only- perhaps because they were from a fat 32 system and loaded onto a ntfs
system I guess- I am not sure though. But yes I learned that one the other
day while updating my PC at the office with eq files from home. Thank you
for your help though -  it is very appreciated. It is no fun to sit here in
front of a new monster computer and not be able to use it for EQ.
