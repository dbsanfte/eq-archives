True indeed. This is EXACTLY how I started EQ...

Ok... not EXACTLY, after all. 1) We didn't live that far apart in RL. 2) 
We didn't give 2 shits what the others were going to do, and figured 
(rightly enough) that as long as we didn't all create the same thing 
we'd be ok... we ended up with an Enchanter, a Ranger, a Rogue, a 
Warrior, and a Wizard. Desperately light on healing, but still more than 
viable in those lowbie levels.

Almost. It was night time, I couldn't see shit, even after equiping my 
starter torch. Still... day must be soon right? :)

Obviously slightly different in my case... but same idea.

Let me guess your response: "GASP. Oh No! Its not fair... WAHHHHHH!"

We on the other hand had our first epiphany... EQs newbie area's were 
separated by race, there were large distances and dangerous creatures in 
the intervening spaces, and my Dark Elf enchanter was decidely unwelcome 
in my High Elf Wizard friends home city and vice versa.

We promptly shelved those characters and rolled up a crew of freeport 
humans. Clearly, for us noobies, if we wanted to play together we would 
have to start in same area on at least compatible factions, at least 
until we learned enough to work around the faction and other obstacles.

(Within a week we'd pulled out our original characters and were happily 
attempting the various treks accross the deserts of ro, through the 
karanas and commons to unite in Befallen.

Oh... so you did have the epiphany too. You just didn't -get- it.

In the original game your choice of starting race had profound 
consequences in terms of what you could realistically or efficiently do 
right away. This was a very cool idea. You got to hangout in your home 
city for a while, meeting and grouping with other ogres or maybe a brave 
troll. Being an ogre meant humans didn't generally like you, elves 
REALLY didn't like you. You were an OGRE!!

You, apparently thought choosing a race was on par with with selecting a 
hair style. Me, I like a little more depth in my games.

More like pretty stupid. Why didn't they get a bind? If they couldn't 
get a bind WHY did they engage risky targets so far from home?

And? So?

That happens all the time even now. I'm doing a DoN...be an hour. I'm 
doing an LDoN be an hour. I'm raiding... be an hour. I'm deep into 
Akheva Ruins with another group... be an hour. I'm in an RSS group... be 
a least an hour.

What exactly is bad about a game world was so large your choices are 
actually affected by it. Somebody on another continent is literally so 
far away you can't play with them in 5 minutes. You really develop an 
appreciation of scale...here I'm in Crushbone... and you're half a world 
away... simply getting to you is an adventure unto itself. Talk about 
immersion!! I'm hooked...

Oh wait... you were too busy having a temper tantrum because you weren't 
being instantly gratified. 

/sigh

> How many counter examples do you need?

Examples where you show just how immersive the game world was, in terms 
of raw size and the number obstacles in it hardly proves your case. 

Even if it did make you cry, those very features are what made EQ so 
interesting. It wasn't Quake. It wasn't Diablo. It was a world. My 
friends were in it... but just like in the real world if they took off 
to Europe... I wasn't likely going to hook up with them for 20 minutes 
on my lunch break.

(For what its worth, I don't object to fast travel in the game. As you 
get higher level you *do* legitimately need faster travel. Crossing the 
Karanas at 70th is not an adventure anymore, its not a challenge... and 
I'd be happy to give characters options to travels faster as they level 
up. PoK, on the other hand eliminated travel for everybody starting at 
level 1.... way overkill.

> It's a game.  It's about having fun. 

We actually *were* having fun. Sure it sucked to die, but that just made 
not dying all the more satisfying an accomplishment.

Of course, according to you, because dying isn't FUN it should be 
eliminated. So they should remove dying, make you invincible, and thus 
allow you to have more FUN. Without being worried about pesky hitpoints, 
or corpse recoveries, or having to worry about always having a healer 
around. Does that sound like FUN?

Of course, you aren't that draconian... you said it yourself... its 
about CHOICE! So we should be able to die if we want to play that way, 
but when it starts getting old we should be able to type IDGODMODE and 
increase our FUN.
