Good secondary tanks will hit the second and third MOBS a few times to
generate some hate before assisting (as long as they're not breaking mez).

The casters should be rooting (or charming, fearing, whatever makes most
sense) anything that breaks the front line.

Sounds like just inexperienced groups.
