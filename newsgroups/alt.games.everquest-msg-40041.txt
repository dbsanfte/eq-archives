    It doesn't, except for the numbers issue (more lower-level people
required to camp item = less chance you get the item when it drops = longer
time spent at camp). The difference is choice. A farmer has made the
decision that their time can best be spent farming greens. Under TCC, if you
want the item you camp it.

    I've heard this comment a bunch of times, and I still don't get it. Does
this somehow imply that unless the farmer is maximizing his reward/unit time
that he's in the wrong? I could make the argument that most boss mobs were
intended to be attacked by large groups to whom the majority of the dungeon
was XP-bearing, and for whom the boss mob would be a serious challenge. So
why is it still OK to kill boss mobs when they're low blues and the dungeon
is green, according to the "I get XP" group? You can't be arguing that
you're doing things "as intended" just based on XP status, so what ARE you
saying?

    That's one of the issues, though. There isn't a clean continuum of gear
for all needs. Easy examples are INT/WIS gear, and resist gear. Most of the
short-race players killing Vox or Nagafen are wearing Crushbone Tunics. If
you want to go to Kedge and are serious about living through LDs and
dispel-casting mermaids, you get a Fishbone Earring because the alternatives
drop in places like Siren's Grotto, or off Lodizal. We've already beaten the
Gator gear point into the ground. ;-)

    I feel that a TCC world would, in the end, have a lower supply of items.
Fewer farmers would be capable of farming TCC items, and people that were
level appropriate would have to group in greater numbers at a given camp
then if those camps were being farmed by a few people. More people at fewer
camps means less items.

    SoL has already been referred to as "EQ1.5". It is the testing ground
for EQ2 technology and concepts. If that Seattle Times article was correct
about EQ2 being on the horizon, then now is the time to be heard.

    True. Unless the goal is "I'd really like to play a little bit more
TODAY, instead of waiting for player X to get from Thurgadain to Lake of Ill
Omen where he died".

    Not everyone can survive it. If you've ever had to wait for a GM when
you've died, you know how frustrating a process it is. And for whatever
reason I've found that GMs seem to believe a high-level player more so than
a low level player, and a player describing something that does not have a
material stake in something (GM res) versus someone that does. And that
believability goes a long way towards determining if the issue will ever be
addressed.

    True. But less immersive environments discourage people from even
trying. Why bother, when you have to ignore the information the game gives
you? It's always more fun to roleplay with EQ rather than despite EQ.

    Then you've opened a HUGE kettle of fish. EQ used to have just this
coding, but then people rightly pointed out that quests aren't just done for
the material reward. They're done for faction. Right now, there's a few
race/class combinations out there that start Dubious or less to the
Kejekans. There's apparently no NPCs that can be killed to raise that
faction. That leaves you with.... quests. Is it appropriate that a low-level
Teir'Dal could, with a LOT of work, sell at the Kejekan Village but a
higher-level could never do so? There's what looks like zone connection
areas off of Stonebrunt, so this isn't a trivial concern.

    There's also concerns about multi-level quests. In the old world,
Soulfire was the classic example - if you didn't start the Soulfire quest
within your first few levels (when you likely didn't know about it), you got
locked out of the early steps and thus from the quest as a whole. In
Stonebrunt, the Freeing the Spirits quest is currently set up in a similar
fashion. Some of the spirits one needs to kill for quest components are
quite low in level (and under the TCC), while others are *much* higher in
level. So what level range should the quest giver mention the quest under?
When you're of level to take the top spirits, and cannot complete the quest?
At lower level, when you have a snowball's chance in hell of killing the top
spirits? Part of this particular quest will be changed - I imagine the
levels of the spirits will be changed to a more narrow range. But that isn't
some "quick fix" you're proposing to the quest system - it has implications
as to what sorts of quests can and cannot be done.
