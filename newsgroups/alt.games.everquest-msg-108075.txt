"I had the opportunity of not using the Internet for a large portion of
 the previous night. This turned out to be an intensely positive
 experience, as it allowed me to sit back and count the number of ways
 the Internet has corrupted me and exposed me to a world of stupidity
 and filth that I previously never knew existed."
