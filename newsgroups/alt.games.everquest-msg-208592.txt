I couldn't pull more than one even while sitting in the lap of one.  I
started getting really silly towards the end of my time camping there,
-trying- to make them be social.  No dice.  Also, no faction hits... Same
with the Aviaks I started pulling recently; see I'd been warned that they
would start out indifferent but faction hits from killing them would make
them hate me and that would be trouble.  As it turns out, no faction hit, so
I needn't have worried!

Its vaguely possible that its different on FV than on other servers, since
once the mobs go green there's not a thing you can do but hope someone lower
level farms the drop but doesn't need it.

Or perhaps not.  Some items I've needed have dropped from green to me mobs,
other items haven't, I think its to do with whether the item in question is
flagged Magic Item or not.

It would be nice to believe someone figured out that a drop rate so rare
that mobs go green before you are halfway thru collecting them just isn't
good design... but I wouldn't put it past them to correct only for one
peculiar server's particular problems.
