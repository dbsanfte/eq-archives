Good advice, but the cleric needs to chill out too, especially if he's a
guild mate. After all, anyone can hand in a parchement or rune to the
appropriate turn in npc for a spell, so it easily could have been rolled
after it was looted and handed in to the winner's spell npc.

Better yet, have evac loaded when you group and learn when it's time to
get out of dodge. Nothing annoys me more than a wizard who doesn't have
evac up in group situation, and I'm sure most people probably feel the
same way.

At 56 I'd think you'd need a ringer group to have much hope of getting
through the trials unless you're very well geared. The trials were hard
for non vt guilds early in pop even at 60 except with carefully formed
groups. Now they're a cakewalk for elemental level players but unless
you have a couple of well geared 65's I have my doubts of you getting
through without a lot of work.

On the other hand, if you're working on getting the flags for guild
progression you really need to do a bit more homework so you at least
know what zone's you're flagging for.
