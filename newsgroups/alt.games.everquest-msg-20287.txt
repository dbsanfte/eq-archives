My ranger is level 39 now. Dual weild is a nice skill that increases your
damage rate quite a bit. You can now train in two melee skills at the same
time if you want. I chose to stick with one hand slashing for both hands but
will really be in a bind if I get a good blunt or piercing weapon.You will
lose the AC from the shield but there are weapons out there that have AC. To
find a list you will have to go to the equipment list first. Then list
primaryhand or secondary hand and sort by AC

This is a good place to research for your ranger.

Hope you have as much fun play your ranger as I do.    Eelu on Chazic Thule
