That would be good option as I agree that it's a little too easy.  Another
good move would have been some sort of token that you have to get in the
zone before you can use the portal to get there so you have to have
travelled to the zone at least once through more difficult means.

I can't complain too much though because I really love the ease of travel.
I remember spending hours just running my little rogue from Qeynos to
HighKeep, HighKeep to Freeport over and over again.  BLEH!  Not to mention
what a pain it was to go get my shaman spells in Halas.  Either get a druid
to gate to Surefall, or take the nearest spire to North Karana and run
through North Karana, West Karana (the worst), Qeynos Hills and Blackburrow.

What I do miss though is seeing the other cities and locations populated
with people gathering for raids, or stopping in after a group/raid to bank
etc...  There was more often a mix of levels in a variety of zones.  Now the
only place you really see this is in POK, SH, Nexus and the Bazaar.  All the
other cities are just newbie cities, even Freeport, which used to be a very
entertaining place and for a newbie really had the feel of going to the big
city for the first time.
