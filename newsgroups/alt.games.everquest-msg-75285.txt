  Is there any quest I can do, or mob I can kill at level 24 to become
non-KOS in Ogguk?  Right now they're scowling at my erudite shadow
knight pretty hard and it would be nice to have somewhere relatively
near Guk and the Temple of Cazic-Thule to get bound in.  As it is,
Arena's the closest, and that's not really what I'd call "close".  The
trolls of Grobb don't take any more kindly to me, and from what I've
heard, it's basically impossible to improve Grobb faction if you're
not already well-liked.  I suppose I can wait until level 30 when I
can make myself invisible and get bound that way, but I'd still like
to have at least some town in southern Antonica that I can make my
"base of operations."

  So, if there is a reasonably "doable" quest or mob to kill to get
liked in Ogguk, I'd like to hear it.  Searched the web on the subject,
but I wasn't able to turn up much.  Thanks.
