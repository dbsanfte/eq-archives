I'm playing EQ as I type this (two computers -- aaah) and my
/petition about the broken boat from FV to BBM got answered by
Guide Ellishae again (DOH).

Anyway, he/she/it absolutely *insists* I'm wrong about the boat
being broken (I've taken this damned ride 1000 times, I think I
can figure out when something is wrong).

Anyway, now he/she/it is ignoring me, without even the slightest
attempt to fix the problem.  Is there anywhere we can lodge
complaints about Guides?  This Ellishae character is just too
much of an incompetent boob to NOT complain, if such a thing is
possible.

P.S. Guide Ellishae, if you're reading this: YOU'RE A FUCKING
MORON!  I feel better now.  :)
