Then color me arrogant, but considering what some people do in the name of 
their religion, saying that they take it much too seriously is putting it 
very mildly indeed.

Something that hold such a high place in a person's life is *not* off limits 
when the problem is not so much the thing itself, but the fact that it does 
hold such a high place. I'm all for religion if it makes you happy, but if 
you hold your religion in such a high place that it makes you miserable, and 
it makes you make others miserable (burkas, anyone?), then, I'm sorry, but 
I'm all against it.
