I have a Nvidia Ti 4200 128 MB,AMD 1.33 Ghz,512 MB ram.It runs EQ 1
nicely with most graphic gimmicks turned off and 1280 * 1024
resolution,for most other games I play occasionly,Internet Browsing,
terrestrial digital TV,video recording and cutting, and MP3 this
mashine is already insanely overpowered.
Does Sony really expect I buy a new PC just for EQ2 while there is
another MMPORPG out now,which runs smoother than EQ1 on my PC ?

All I can say,just another nail in the coffin for EQ2.
Really I cant stop laughing about all those weird decisions they made
with EQ2.
