The DPoC is, indeed, worthwhile all the way to 65.   I haven't logged in for
awhile, but from memory I would say the big four post 60 are (excluding
Firebolt of Tallon, which is vendor purchaseable):

1. Ward of Xegony (61 air pet)
2. Black Steel (63 nuke)
3. Summon Sapphire Bracelet (unless you have an ID 4 item).
4. Summon Glowing Bauble (mana reduction on nukes, a little better than a
regular mana reduction 4 item).

That's a bread and butter pet, a bread and butter nuke, and bread and butter
summoned items.

Next level - maybe not bread and butter, but they tend to be so cheap you
might as well:

Servant of Marr - 62 water pet, best DPS when positioned from behind.  If
you group, this is a valuable pet.
Flameshield of Ro - A 45 point DS probably really isn't much more valuable
than the pre-60 33 pointer in the grand scheme of things, but you might as
well have the best DS available.

Tough decisions for the cash strapped mage - pet items, pet heal, mana regen
Belt of Magi'Kot - pet-only 250hp, +10 to a lot of stats
Girdle of Magi'Kot -  pet-only 500 hp, +15 to a lot of stats
Blade of Somebody (61) - pet weapon
Fist of Ixiblat (62) - pet weapon
Blade of Walnan (63) - pet weapon
Transons Something or Other (64) - pet heal, 1200 hp for 300 mana
Xegony's Phantasmal Guard - 8 mana/tic regen, plus hp regen.

The weapons are all very similar spells, they summon weapons you can give to
a pet.  The weapons have about 50 hps and proc that can hit for 140 points
(I think).  The big difference is the resist - magic for the 61 Blade, Fire
for Ixiblat, and Cold for Walnan.  If money's tight, pick one and use your
money towards other spells.  I like Blade of Walnan because I think that
cold is the best resist to work against, but since we don't see the actual
damage from these weapon procs there's no way to be sure.

I would probably rank them:
1. Girdle - if you're leveling to 65 and have limited cash, wait to buy the
Girdle instead of the Belt.
2. One of the pet weapons
3. XPG
4. Pet heal

The pet weapons are really not that useful, not for mage pets (they don't
proc that often, even with chanter or shammy dex buffs), but I didn't want
to seem like derelict when pickup groupmates asked for pet kits.  If you
solo, the weapons aren't that important.  I might go with the pet heal in
slot #1 or 2 in that case.  XPG is nice, but you can get 6 mana/tic with the
Transon's Phantasmal Protection, so you're not hurt too much by not having
it.

If you want to solo, Rathe's Son (65 earth) is supposed to be the best tank
with the recent mitigation changes, but it tends to be very expensive.  If
you like to solo, have the money and see this spell on sale, get it.

Sun Vortex - has a higher max damage and slightly better damage/mana ratio
than Black Steel.  Nice to have, but it tends to be rare and expensive.

There are a couple of rains in there between 61 and 65.  I haven't been big
on rains since I was in my 40's, but others swear by them.  I think there's
one at 62(?) and one at 64, so if you're leveling to 65 you might as well
wait and get the level 64 spell.

The level 63 summoned-only mez spell (Elemental Silence) tends to be more of
a toy than anything.  I found it moderately useful in regular Tak LDoN's,
but since it has a level cap of 59 it was pretty hit and miss in terms of it
working.

I have the level 65 charm.  I've heard it's useful in BoT and there's a mob
in Tak normal that I think can be charmed with it.  All I've really used it
for was having fun in Lavastorm.



I haven't logged my mage in for quite awhile, so hopefully I didn't forget
anything too important. :=)
