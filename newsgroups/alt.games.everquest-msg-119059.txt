Hmmm, for some reason EQ doesn't work behind my Linksys Cable Modem Router.
Which is doing NATing, although I did set this PC up as the DMZ and
everything else I've run goes through.  I don't know if this router is
hosing the UDP or something.  It works fine if I just plug it in (but then
the other computer isn't on the net...)

Wacky.  It surprises me to hear that people have it working natted with no
problem.  Because that means that I have a 'real problem' and not a 'problem
that's supposed to happen'.  (And I don't like having to deal with them when
I'm at home!  That's for work!)
