What i do, even if it isn't the most effective, is to place the hotkeys
closer to each other... as example

y = me, g, h, j, k, l = groupmembers

x = sit

c = hotkey 1 which is complete heal
q = hotkey 2, a quick heal
` = 3, area
e = 4, celestial

so it's x - g - e - x for sit up, cast celestial on groupmember 1, sit down.
This way you don't need variables with adding one more key.

My 2 copper ;)
