OK, now I'm starting to worry.  This is the type of change that I can see 
being a HUGE mistake.  The hell levels exist because the basic exp 
required multiplier didn't scale smoothly.  I can several ways that they 
can fix this, but the best way would actually punish most people by making 
it so that all non-hell levels from 31 on require MORE exp to complete.  
I certainly hope they're not going to just lower the total EXP required 
and boost everyone a level or two.
