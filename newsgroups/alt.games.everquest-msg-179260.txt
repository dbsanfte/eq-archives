Doesn't need to be 60+ for the reavers, doesn't even need a full group.
This from the perspective of a far from uberly equipped person.  I have been
there to take down Neh'Ashiir with one group, I was 57 at the time.  I
believe the group was 57 shaman, 61 Ranger, 60 Cleric, 59 Paladin, 55 Rogue,
56 mage.  Only person that was equipped in better than old Planar plus a
smattering of Thurgadin is the Ranger who has VT quality equipment.
