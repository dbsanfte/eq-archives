There is a really easy piece you can get in Netherbian.  It drops off the
Swarm Leader which you will find if you camp near the pillar and pull from
the caverns there.  The stats for the item are +20AC  +2STR +10 Fire.  It
called a Netherbian Chitin if you want to get more information about it. It
drops quite often. I spent about one level there and it dropped 3 times.
