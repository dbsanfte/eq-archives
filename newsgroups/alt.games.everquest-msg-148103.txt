A great deal of EQers don't have access to the broadband thing you
need to have to play it. I doubt it will be worth playing though.
Would you really want to play eq without a mouse and keyboard? And
if you did happen to get a PS2 mouse and keyboard plus hook your PS2
up to the internet with a really fast connection why don't you just
play the damn thing on a computer in the first place? :p So this is
one EQer who won't be playing it at least. Knowing verent in a year or
two after it's release we'll be seeing the PC version of PS2's
everquest, you know them being retarded and all.
