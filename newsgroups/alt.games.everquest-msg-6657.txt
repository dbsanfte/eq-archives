Depends. if you are a New Zealander then the pets follow all the standard
commands plus the following extra commands:

/missionary: standard attack with small defensive bonus but pet becomes
susceptible to sleep spells.
/threesome: the pet always tries to get between you and the mob making it
harder to hit you.
/taint: pet gains backstabb ability when equipped with piercing weapon but
side effect is -30 SV disease.
/avenger: pet gains 'enduring breath' and +30 SV 'choke'.


/squeallikeapig: has a fear-like effect combined with limited mobility as
the mob refuses to turn it's back to you whislt fleeing.
