I saw a post here some time ago about a dark elf, about level 40, whose
player got bored of EQ.  Instead of doing the eternal /camp, he dicided to
make as big a nuisance of himself as possible until the GMs banned him.
This spell, Sentinel, a couple of obscene last names (he chose another as
soon as the GM removed the one he had), and a few 8 spectre trains to the
Oasis docks were all involved.

As another poster already said, this spell's primary value seems to be for
those who wish to annoy others.
