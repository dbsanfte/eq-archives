    These items are good enough that you won't see them on twinks any time
soon. People need them for mains, and the dungeon itself is tough enough
that you don't see folks casually pulling nameds to zone. Although with our
guild leader's sense of humour I could see him rolling up a level 1 rogue
and draping him with raid loot from the bank. It's bad enough we were
awarding Peerless stuff from WW to Vah Shir twinks the other night.
