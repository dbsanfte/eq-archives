In all of my time playing, I have seen Grimfeather all of once, and
that after I dinged 46... nice, blue, and dead.  And have been beating
on HG's, to varying degrees of success, for the last 15-16 levels...
now it is a simple root and rot.

I was very put off by the tone of the message to begin with, with the
open admission of cussing out another player, later admitted ignorance
excepted.  I don't particularly think someone should be killing guards
in newbie areas for the sheer pleasure of it.  But when there is a
reason (quest, faction, KoS attack) they are just another mob... 

And maybe the fact that I weaned off of guards early has something to
do with my attitude about it as well.

While guards may indeed be a valid escape method, they should not be
the main, or only, one.
