More skillful in the sense that because you actually practiced the 
skill, you reduced fizzles during a fight. Nothing is more annoying 
than seeing a member of a pickup group fizzle time and again because 
they never practiced a skill.

I find EQ2 has a distinct lack of spells. In EQLive, I have many 
spellsets based on the type of fight I'm going into. In EQ2, so far 
that is, I have few spells, and use one only once due to it often 
getting interrupted due to it's lengthy casting time. Other than the 
buff spells, I have very few offensive spells, so it's almost 
impossible not to reduce combat to a formula. Root, cast 1, cast 2, 
root breaks, cast 3, cast 3, cast 3, cast 3 etc. If the heroic 
whatever comes up, then it requires only a minor change to get the 
bonus. 7 times out of 10, no change, as spell 3 is required time and 
again.

Only have Goblin Mastery so far, but my playing time is ever 
dwindling, so I don't expect to get any of the others.

To this point, I have never seen a rare, but I see how they can/will 
make a difference. What I can also see is that if you are of the lucky 
sort, and there are people born with the proverbial horseshoe up the 
wazoo, then improvements will depend more on luck than on skill. Like 
you describe above, I am one who maxes all skills possible after 
leveling. I know many who never bother. In EQ2 this attention to 
detail seems to mean nothing and I would be dependent on the luck of 
drops, which I never seem to get, in EQ2 or in EQLive. My personal 
experience has been a distinct lack of luck which I try to counter by 
trying to be as skillful as I possibly can. I don't see that so far, 
and I emphasize the so far part. At 22 I've barely scratched at the 
surface of this game, but with no evidence to the contrary, I see not 
much reason to continue leveling any further. By 22 in EQLive, I knew 
it was a game I wanted to pursue. Heck I knew it at 10.

I might try going over to the other side, and join Freeport. Anyone 
done that quest yet? How involved is it?
