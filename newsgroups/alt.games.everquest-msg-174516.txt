So far I've only dealt with yard trash, but my 51 cleric was not
experiencing particularly extraordinary aggro in PoJ or PoI a week
or two ago. I wasn't CHealing too much (except in PoI, where damage
levels were *insane...) but given what I had heard, and my level, I
was expecting aggro to be much worse than it was.

There was a note in one of the patches a couple of weeks ago that
they had modified healing aggro on some Planes - I expect you're seeing
the same thing I was, with a level advantage to make it even more
bearable.

Basically healing aggro levels currently seem not much worse than
I've seen elsewhere.
