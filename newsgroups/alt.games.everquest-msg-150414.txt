Oh, they're as common as dirt in the bazaar... or would be, if dirt were 
10pp a shot ;p  Stick to vendor mining, what with the increased amount 
of items you can view it's VERY easy to find words you need.  Heck even 
checking vendors way the heck deep into Neriak has found me words I 
needed.

Also, when you're grouping, try and keep an eye on what people are 
looting.  Ask if you can have the words, lots of times the looter will 
say yes because the words are useless to them and don't sell to vendors 
for enough to squabble over.  And if you pick up words for another 
class, ask that class if they need them.  If that class isn't around, 
keep them and try /oocing in busy zones your level that you're trading 
words/pages/runes/whatever for words.
