>Are there any rules against selling characters here??

This is a newsgroup, there are no rules except against off topic posts
or spam. No matter what anyone says selling characters would be on
topic but is frowned upon by many posters here. This group really has
no "official" faq so is more or less just comes under common usenet
etiquette. Someone does post a faq which I'd wager probably also says
its frowned upon.

If you want to sell characters, there are already places to do that
such as www.playerauctions.com and it would be best if you went there.
