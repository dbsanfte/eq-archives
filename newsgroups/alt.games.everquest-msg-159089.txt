I don't think anybody phrased it quite concisely enough for you, so I
will try to do so. 

If a 54 warrior and a 55 shaman actually make it to the Arena entrance
alive, you will be smashed into pudding suitable for stuffing halflings
with. The giants there see invis, and you have no way of splitting them.
Even slowed, they dish out more damage than the two of you are prepared
to absorb, and have more HP than you could dish out in five solid
minutes of fighting. I seriously doubt you could take *one* of them, and
you will get at least two, if not four when you pull.

I think I've seen an armor piece drop off those entry guards *once*
since we started raiding Kael well over a year ago.

Your plan needs more work. You need a lot more people, and to push on
into the Arena itself if you seriously want a shot at some armor. And
your tank should be beefed up a bit.

Later on you can do it with a lot less. (We go in there now to fix
dragon faction and camp the arena with one group of 55 to 60 and can
clear as far as the PoZ.) But two players at your level who, from the
sound of it, are not in any sort of uber gear, are not going to live
very long around there.
