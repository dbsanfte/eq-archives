I ask again, what the fuck does their income from other
services/sources have to do with the amount you pay monthly? You are
getting EXACTLY what you are paying for.

And you payed jack shit to SOE or VI for them to come out and delete
files from your computer to fix a graphics glitch. Comparing that to
replacing a car engine is asanine, too. It takes a lot more work and
technical know-how to replace a car engine than it does to highlight a
few files and hit delete.

Actually, it doesn't require much intelligence. Everything is
"scripted" out. Part of the reason I left was I got sick of being
punished for breaking the script when I knew the damn thing was wrong.
Apparently, they don't WANT their service reps to be smart...
