Almost, but not quite.  Scientists don't get to decide what's "real" 
science.  They have to write grants, and convince various funding agencies 
that what they choose to study is "real" science.  

I took one of my undergraduate Biochemistry lab courses from Dr. Peter 
Deusberg at UC Berkeley.  He has a terrible time getting fuding for any 
research.  He's a virologist, and he's convinced that AIDS is not caused 
by HIV.  If you actually follow back the chain of evidence, the hypothesis 
that AIDS is caused by HIV is actually fairly tenuous, and the person who 
started that chain of evidence with a single article released from the 
Center for Disease Control that cited no sources and was not refereed, is 
now very, very, rich from sale of his patented HIV test kits.

Then you consider that there are cases where HIV is detected and AIDS 
doesn't develop, and similarly cases where AIDS develops and no HIV is 
detected.  Sure, there's tons of epidemiological evidence to show that the 
presence of HIV and development of AIDS are -very- closely related, but 
there is still no proven demonstration of a mechanism for how exactly an 
HIV infestation depresses the immune system.  There's some hypotheses, of 
course, but none that are clearly the answer.

So I'm left to wonder.  Why exactly can't Dr. D get funding to check out 
some alternate explanations?  Hmm.

Politics is amusing to the point of scary when people call it science.

[PS: I haven't really looked into this whole stuation in any detail for a 
couple years now.  It's possible they figured out such a mechanism, or 
something.  Personally, I don't think that would diminish the value of my 
point much.  But as you will.]

}> Why is it the people that believe in this stuff,
}> cannot find any proof?

Possibly because they lack the tools to do the research.

}Your "skeptics" do a good job at controlling the reins of science by writing
}everyone who doesn't agree with them off as "loonies."  You guys ever think
}of starting a church?

It's called CSICOP.  Committee For Scientific Investigation into Claims of 
the Paranormal.  They're a fun bunch. :)

}> I heard a creationist scientist (an astronomist),

Not willing to allow the poor fellow even the proper title of astronomer?
