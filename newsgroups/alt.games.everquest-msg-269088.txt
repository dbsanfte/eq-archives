After grinding out like 10 writs last night I will be happy.  Worst thing
is when I had to kill young kodiaks but had to kill a bunch of wolves to
get them to spawn only to have a large group come up and take it away from
me.  I did a tell to them advising them to kill wolves but they said they
just wanted the bears and too bad for me.  People are stupid.
