Dunno.  Maybe they're too stupid to check what the groups actually talk
about.  Maybe they think we're all impressionable juveniles.  Or maybe they
think that the fact that some of us spend three-plus hours a day pretending
to blow up critters that never existed makes us more prone to random acts
of sensless violence than other people.  Personally, my money is on the
first option.
