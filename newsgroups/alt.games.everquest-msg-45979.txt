    My husband and I just read the features of the 
new role-playing server, FV.  We've decided we'd 
like to dynamic duo it.  So, any thoughts as to
what would be the best to start out as?
   On Drinal, we've had lots of fun, so far, with
Woodelf Ranger and Gnome Wizard.  I'm leaning 
towards this with the roleplaying server. Tracking
is hard to live without once you get used to it, 
and with a wizard we get ports later on.  The
main problem is the lack of healing power, as far
as I can see.  Oh, and this way we can teach each 
other a new language as we fight, while being able
to call voice (we live in different states while
he is deployed) when things get hairy.  
    
   Annie  <--- Kinda looking forward to this going 
               live.
