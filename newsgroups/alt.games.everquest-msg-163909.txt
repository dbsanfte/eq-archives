I doubt it would do any good.   It's not like an escort quest where the
prisoner is an NPC walking around, and it just dies.

It's more that when the Executioner reaches the appointed spot, he begins
the script counting down to death, then at the end of that the prisoner dies
and you are given the failure message, in an areawide emote type thing.

Whether the prisoner is just a level 1 that dies in one hit, or if he just
despawns as soon as the script runs out... who could say?  My money is on
him just despawning at the end of the script though.
