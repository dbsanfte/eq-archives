*snip all content - Nothing really to comment on in a discussion of "the
reasons why NBG doesn't make sense" when I don't agree with the basic
premise.  NBG does make sense.*

You know, I find it a bit odd that everyone here keeps saying how everything
should be /random to everyone...  yet I've never actually encountered this
attitude in game.  I can't think of a single time someone has objected when
NBG was suggested.   And as far as I can remember, only once was it
mentioned in guildchat that a person's pickup group was doing this.  (In
reference to how the group leader was applying it unfairly.  Making Kunark
class armor open roll, but spell drops strictly NBG.  Back in mid-Velious
days when both were big deals.)

Kind of makes me wonder if you're really the majority that you claim.

Or perhaps E'ci is just a better server in this reguard.   If so, I'm glad
I'm there.
