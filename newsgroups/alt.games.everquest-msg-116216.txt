Actually, as figured as a percentage of income, Gates and family don't rate
very well. I read an extensive article that said that among the incredibly
wealthy, it's customary to donate 10% of gross income to charities. Last I
read Gates was giving around half a percent.

The article went on to say that when the hubbub started about this,
Microsoft went on a big campaign releasing press releases about how they
have donated millions of dollars to charities and schools. The article
quickly debunked this pointing out that Microsoft was donating software and
claiming the full retail cost of their software (a cost no one ever pays in
Reality) while comparable companies (like IBM, SUN, etc.) only claimed the
"production cost" of the software... a figure 10 to 20 times lower... and
they were STILL giving away more than Microsoft.
