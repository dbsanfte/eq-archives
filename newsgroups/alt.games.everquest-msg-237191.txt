Vampires were just an example.  Highlander...  Pretty much any form of 
fiction dealing with immortality, if it goes on long enough, eventually 
deals with the problem somehow, that nobody who's sane would really want 
to live -forever-.  The first few hundred years is good, sure.  But 
eventually, nobody even remembers the favorite music you grew up with, the 
town you grew up in becomes a ghost town, all your relatives and childhood 
friends die, society's values head off in some direction that contrast too 
strongly with your own, your favorite sun goes supernova, the species 
you started out as a member of goes extinct, and the universe degenerates 
into heat death and gets really dull.  Do you want to stick around for 
that?  Thought not.  Fear of eternal boredom, ugh.

}I'd go out like Spike.

He was alive and kicking in last night's episode... Sure, he was a ghost 
for a while there...  But no end to his existence in sight yet...
