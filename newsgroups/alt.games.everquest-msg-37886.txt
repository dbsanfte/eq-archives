I am dead set against trivial loot code . I have also never farmed a single
item off of any green mob .

A good definition of farmed would be - The continual camping and killing of
a specific type of mob with the intent to sell or trade that mobs drop
multiple times.

I am also as uber as they get and thus not supposed to be effected by the
tcc but it just rubs me so wrong its not funny . Eq has lost several
thousand of its most loyal customers in the last couple of weeks and that is
just the beginning . Those of us just holding out hope that someone wakes up
or gets fired real soon at verant are no longer trickling but gushing away.
