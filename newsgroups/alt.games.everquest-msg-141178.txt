Hi all, I play eq fine with luclin models off, but when I turn them on i get
occasional 1/2 second pauses, slower framerate and sometimes get dropped to
desktop.  Question is I can afford to either replace my video card or get
more ram, what would help more?

Current system
Celeron 1.3(Tualatin)
Shuttle AV18E MB
Geforce 2 MX400 64MB SDRAM AGP
256MB SDRAM

Problem is my ram is 128x64x64=256 and I only have 3 memory slots.  So
basically in order to get 512 I would have to replace both 64's and get
another 128 and a 256, but that would also be about the same price as a
single 512 which I would probably do.  Thanks for any advice on the upgrade
and the Video card I am looking at is the 4200 or the 4400
