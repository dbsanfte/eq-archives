I've always objected to the phrase "trivial" to denote this, since it
implies that once you can no longer get a skill-up on the item, it should be
easy to make.  In fact, you can still get lots of failures on items that are
supposed to be "trivial".  For me, Blue Diamond Powder in Pottery was
"trivial" when my skill was 103, but I still failed a lot until I spent some
time raising my skill.  Losing a Blue Diamond on a "trivial" combine
*hurts*.  =(  Still, "trivial" is the commonly accepted term in the
tradeskill community, so get used to it.

There are very few items that have a minimum required skill to attempt.
Very few.  Most combines you can attempt no matter what your skill is.  Mind
you, if you attempt a Heraldic armor combine with a smithing skill of 21,
you're gonna fail 999 times out of a thousand.  :)

There almost certainly is, but SOE is keeping it secret from us.  People
have devised theories - a common one is that with every skill-up, your
chance to successfully combine an item increases by 1%.  Clearly that
doesn't apply to attempting an item with a 255 trivial when your skill is
44, but it's a "rule of thumb" that's as good as any.

Ah, that's a different question.  You chance of a getting a skill-up is
another secret formula kept by SOE.  It's directly based on your stats.  For
example, the chance of getting a skill-up in smithing is based on the
highest of your WIS, INT, or STR stats.

Whether or not the trivial level of the item you're attempting affects your
chance of getting a skill-up is a topic of some mild debate.  Some people
feel you get a better skill-up rate if you're within 20 skill points of the
trivial.  I don't buy that; I think your skill-up rate is completely
independent of the trivial.

When I was doing smithing, I was using Shadowscream Bracelets (trivial 238)
to get skill-ups when my skill was 188.  Worked well for me.  I think you're
doing the right thing in attempting something with a 240 trivial to get your
own skill to go up.

Hope this makes sense.  =)  As others have said, eqtraders.com is a good
source of info.
