The activity of this fun conveniently undefined. It will still reset
to exactly the same thing I just said. Unless all you're doing is
socializing, of course... but then, that can be done while travelling,
too....

The "a smart company caters to what the playerbase wants" qualifies
nicely. The playerbase is constant and inconsistent; it wants
different things. You seem unwilling to accept the idea a successful
game can be made on the concept of a world, rather than on maximizing
efficient use of time.

I am not surprised at all. The mindset of the developers moved towards
your own. Obviously you will like something that is catering to you
more than something that's not.

Not everyone is you, however.

It's worth noting here that, while more people play EQ than any other
mmorpg, the majority of people who play mmorpgs DON'T play EQ, from
the last numbers I saw. That sneaky playerbase is getting slipperier
in their appetites all the time, isn't it?

So, you believe because you can't find immersion in any crpg, no one
should even try, because the playerbase obviously doesn't want it?
