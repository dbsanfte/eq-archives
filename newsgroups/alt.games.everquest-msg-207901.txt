    You didn't look hard enough, then. Solusek Ro's Tower is dripping with
Ornate molds, to the point that everyone assumes there has to be a nerf. One
raid netted **55** molds clearing one mini boss. Over the weekend the place
was crawling with XP groups cashing in on the stupidly high drop rate. You
know it's broken when, instead of clearing any elemental content, the local
guild that is flagged for Time runs right to Solusek Ro's Tower to clear as
much as they can after the patch.
