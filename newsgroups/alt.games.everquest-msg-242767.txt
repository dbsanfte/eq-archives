Yes.  That's what you posted.  What you posted is incorrect.   What part of
this are you not understanding?

And you're calling other people idiots?


Fine... I'll explain the difference once more.   And I'll use small words so
there might be a chance you can follow it.

Unlocking items is based on what you have earned, not what you have
purchased.  Saying it is based on what you have purchased is incorrect.

Example 1.   A person earns 500 points at Mistmoore, and 1000 points at
other camps.     They buy a 500 point item at Mistmoore.  They then earn 300
more points in Mistmoore.    They are now able to purchase any item in the
Mistmoore camp that costs less than 800, because that is the total they have
earned in that camp.

According to you, they could only purchase an item at Mistmoore that goes up
to 500, since that is the highest they have purchased there previously.
If it was based on purchases, that would mean they would have to earn and
then spend 800 points after their 500 purchase, before they're able to
unlock 800 point items.


Example 2.  A person earns 500 points at Mistmoore caverns, and 1000 points
at Tak.    They buy two items from Tak, one for 900 points, and one for 500
points.  The person then earns 500 points at Everfrost.     They can use
those 500 points earned in Everfrost to buy any item up to 500 points at
Mistmoore, since they previously earned 500 in Mistmoore.

According to you, they would not be able to purchase from Mistmoore, since
they did not buy an item with their Mistmoore points, but instead spent them
elsewhere.  No purchased items, no items unlocked.


You may now apologize, slink off quietly or continue to make an ass of
yourself, as you see fit.
