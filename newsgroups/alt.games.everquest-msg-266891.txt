And YOU are ignoring the fact that the core engine of the game can
only be expanded so far. To use your TV analogy, it would be as if one
staton continued to broadcast only in black and white, so as not to
alienate their existing customers.

You are also focusing too heavily on said existing customers. A game
cannot survive without new blood. You note a character represents and
investment. True enough. But for a new player, with no investment,
which he will choose? A game based on an engine which began
development circa 1996, and which is an agglomeration of patches (and
where the culture is heavily weighted towards "uber" players, with
most of the content only becoming accessible at high levels), or a new
game, competitive with the others, without such a dominant culture?

Old players always quit, sooner or later. If the rate of new players
coming in doesn't equal or exceed the old players going out, the game
slowly dies. It may remain barely profitable...but investors don't
care about "barely", and Sony is one of the largest -- and thus, most
investor-conscious -- companies on the planet.

EQ1, like UO, will be a long, long, time dying...so don't worry about
it. I am sure it will still be running 5 years from now, as the costs
of simply keeping the servers up will be low, and the cash will keep
trickling in, enough to justify it for both financial and PR reasons.
Wouldn't do to pull the plug on the companies flagship product so long
as it's operating even a little bit in the black.

Or, of course, you can wait until the Glorious People's Socialist
Revolution happens. Please be sure to email me when it occurs, since I
understand it won't be televised. (This then begs the question of who
really "needs" an MMORPG, and a society where resources are allocated
according to "need" would most likely have no such entertainments. If
you have free time to play games, you are clearly not working up to
your ability, leech on the proletariat! To the re-education camps with
you, Comrade!)
