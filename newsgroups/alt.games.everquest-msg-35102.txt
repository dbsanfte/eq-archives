An amazingly good comparison...

Very much like Nostradamus... write enough (educated) lines, sooner or later
something will happen that resembles one (or more) of them...

Like how I predicted the Chinese Missile Program, and the Indian Nuclear
Weapon tests.

Of course, if I'm a prophet, then I eagerly await the day when the magic
fairies return, and teach sorcery at Harvard...

(Okay, little in joke... I guess you have to be at least passingly familiar
with the million or so unpublished short stories I've written in the last
few decades to fully appreciate it).
