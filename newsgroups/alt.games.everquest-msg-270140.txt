Well, 216/24 is 9, and there are 9 races, so a natural conclusion is
that he's looking at race * class for unique combinations.

However, a good many of the classes can apparantly be either good or 
evil aligned... and I think the rest can switch via betrayal.  This 
implies there are 532 combinations possible.  But you can also vary the 
starting stats quite a bit, bringing it up to thousands of combinations 
per class, and then there are choices as to what artisan path you 
follow... I'm guessing our Ken is going to need a couple hundred 
thousand character slots if he wants to fully explore the possibilities.

This doesn't include gear choices, since after all, he can have a 
character take off a piece of gear and put a different one on.

How about quest paths though?  I know there are non repeatable quests in 
EQ2, are there any where completing quest A makes it impossible to do 
quest B, and vice versa?  We could easily push the number of characters 
needed to explore every possible option up into the millions if this is 
true.

To be more serious, I do think 4 characters total is harsh, particularly 
after EQ1 where you could have 8 per server, I forget how many servers 
there were but thats what, 101 characters more or less?  (the 1 part 
because Firiona Vie only allows one slot per account)

Having played on FV, I can appreciate the idea of limiting people to 
fewer than 8 per server, I guess 4 is a compromise to allow -some- 
alt/twinking.  I can't see the sense of not allowing 4 per server, 
though, there's no interaction between servers, so you aren't changing 
the dynamic on any given server.  I guess the idea is to make people 
more committed to their characters and to their servers; thats what 
seemed to happen with the FV restriction anyway (the character part, it 
made them -less- committed to the server, since to play an alt they had 
to leave it.  Thats not the same situation as in EQ2 though)
