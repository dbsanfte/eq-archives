A great deal of that depends on your race/class, but from your statement on
camo, I would assume you are a ranger/druid or some such thing and therefore
can't travel safely through Cabilis.  But can give you one bit of advice:

Don't port to the DL.  Evac to Emerald Jungle instead.  Head straight west
until you hit wall, follow that north until you see a huge staircase, go up
staircase and go south from there until you can zone west to Field of Bone.
Much safer route of travel, trust me the DL is for very high levels and
scares the crap out of me personally.  Once you are in FoB head northwest
around the pit and zone into Warsliks Woods.  From there go straight West
until you hit the zone wall and go south till you can zone into The
OverThere.  Follow the wall left (south) until you reach the corner then go
west until you reach "the ledge" which will be obvious when you get there.
That's the place most people will pull to.

As to where to bind, I've only ever been there with my Iksar Monk and I bind
in Cabilis, other than that, ask around, I honestly have no idea.

Hope that helps.  Here are some maps on EQAtlas that might help give you a
visual as well:

Oh and a a few tips about OT.  If you here any shouts about the goons (Dark
Elf Dragoons) being anywhere CLOSE to where you are, being to worry and
think about zoning.  They can kill you in about 6 or 7 hits or less
sometimes.  And they are of course KOS to all but evil races.  55+ mobs and
one of them is a bard and has Selo's and there is NO hope of outrunning his
evil ass.  Also avoid the pit in the center and any enormous evil looking
scropions that someone riles up and pisses off.

Have fun, great zone for xp as well as loot.  Cocatrice Beaks sell for a
little over a plat and the money drop is pretty decent as well.
