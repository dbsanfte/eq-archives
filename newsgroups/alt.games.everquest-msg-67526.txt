All depends on the aggro situation of the particular group.  Snare is a good
way for an mediocre druid to get himself killed.  Same for a ranger, once
you're 50 plus.    If there is a chance of pulling aggro from it, I'd much
rather the ranger be the one tanking for a round or two while the MT gets it
back.  He at least has a bit of armor class.
