TM has nice some nice drops if you hunt the right things. The Coterie
General stuff is pretty nice and the grimling mines are easy cash. Large
block of acrylia around 30 pp, large brick around 10 pp and the small bricks
and pieces are for the acrylia tailoring (very nice items). The runes and
gems are a nice cash camp price range from couple silver to over 100 pp
each.
