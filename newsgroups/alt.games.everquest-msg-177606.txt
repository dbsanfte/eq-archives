Getting to Kirn the fast way.

Grab a few paladins and clerics.  They DA/DB, jump into the hole from
Paineel.  Clear out the mobs that are there.  Everyone else jumps in, almost
all die to 20k fall, a few manage to not die.  Everyone rezzed.  Fight to
the courtyard in front of the undead tower where Kirn is.  Everyone invis to
undead, run up to the room with the enchanter epic mob in it.  If you get
aggro, stop and die.  Retrieve corpses.  Rez the dead.  Kill the aggro mobs
in the enchanter epic room.  Pull the mobs from Kirns room, leaving Kirn
there.  Shaman turns in, Kirn agros, pull Kirn to the enchanter epic mob
room, kill Kirn.  Shaman loots ring.  Everyone ports/gates out.  This can
save an hour or two of fighting to the tower from the entrance to the hole.
The invis to undead works quite nicely, but usually you get one or two
deaths during that part due to invis dropping.  Be sure to bring a rogue or
monk to drag the corpses to be rezzed.

Last time we did it this way, we were in and out in 45 minutes.
