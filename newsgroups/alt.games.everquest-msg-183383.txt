Well, as a SK i'm biased, but it seems that since late Luclin/early PoP
other classes are finally beginning to realise that tank hybrids are more
desiable than warriors in xp groups strictly because of their much superior
aggro control. Obviously, some weapons (enraging blow et al) modify this,
but not every warrior has these.

Going from 'Taunt is highest aggro plus one'. (I think. Somebody correct me
if I'm wrong). So, a couple of scenarios (using Warrior & SK, but paladins
have decent aggro gain with their stuns, etc)

Scenario A
Warrior taunts, gains aggro but still has to be careful about not
button-mashing taunt, etc. as he's barely about the next person on the hate
list.
SK taunts, gains aggro and drops some sort spell (terror line, clinging
darkness, whatever) and is a few hundred points about the next person on the
hate list.

Scenario B
Warrior taunts. Taunt fails, and warrior has to either wait for taunt to
refresh or (if he has weapons with a decent proc) hope that his weapons do
proc and that does create enough aggro to drag the mob back to him.
SK taunts. Taunt fails. SK unloads two very fast casting DD spells, a fast
casting snare/dot and a fast casting aggro increaser. He also has the chance
of his self-buff proc firing, and any proc on his weapon working as well.


Aggro control is what SKs (and paladins, to a lesser extent) do. They get
*two* entire spells lines devoted to it, plus quite a few spells that have
high aggro just because of their design (I'm thinking darkness line here,
mainly). It's all about the margin of error, and tank hybrids widen that
quite a bit.

And the warriors aren't happy about it, btw. There's been more than one
thread on the warrior class messageboards asking for SK agrro to be nerfed
because warriors are getting turned down for groups because there's a SK or
Paladin LFG as well. OTOH, shaman and enchanters love us. =)
