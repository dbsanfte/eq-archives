The populations problems seems to have been alleviated a bit with
the server mergers. Before the merger, I could go to CS and hunt
for weeks and never have another soul come into the zone. Now, it's
pretty rare that I can go to the zone and have it all to myself and
people are pretty consistently passing through on their way to SG
or WW. Other zones that I would pretty much have the whole run of
myself are the same way.
