The only real negative to Rangers is they will almost always be overlooked
as a PRIMARY tank.  The problem is they simply don't have the hit points to
take on that role.  This fact becomes very apparent at the high levels where
the only efficient way to heal your primary tank is through complete heals.
A ranger's relatively low Hit Points make them a bad meat shield.

On the positive side, Rangers are great melee additions to any group.  Only
problem here is that people tend to overlook Rangers for higher damage
output classes like monks or rogues (oh wait I am supposed to say the
positive here).  OK, rangers can deal out good damage, have awesome tracking
and good line of spells.  Tracking and SoW makes them great for hunting rare
spawns and completing quests.

I guess it come down to what you want.  If you want a powerful class or a
class that has an easy time finding a group, I don't suggest a Ranger.  If
you like the abilities and idea of being a Ranger, I say go for it.
