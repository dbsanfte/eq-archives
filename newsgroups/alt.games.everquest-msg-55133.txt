Bah. We may have lower INT, but we're the best-looking Necros by far.

My own baby necro is 12 right now, doing in mummies in North Ro. When he's 
old enough, I'll probably move to South Ro. Plenty of undead there, and 
I've always wanted to see the Terrorantula... After soloing my first Hill 
Giant yesterday, and seeing Gorenaire a few days ago, my "to do" list in EQ 
is getting shorter. :)
