    Closest currently would be the 1492 point LDoN crap, and some GoD stuff
if you're stark raving mad. (A few of my non-uberguild friends have managed
to collect so much high LDoN stuff and millions of dollars of bazaar junk
and actually get somewhere in GoD without a group)

    So yes, single-group content is spectacularly far behind, and soloing
you can pretty much forget gear.
