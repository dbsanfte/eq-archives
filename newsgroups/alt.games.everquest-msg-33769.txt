And? I regularly get a group together somewhere like karnors and
port out to the hole, or kael or the like depending on whether folk
want faction, xp, loot, etc. These zones *are* overcrowded and there
*are* viable alternatives, its just that going there for a pickup
group is a vicious circle. 

Nobody goes there because they cant pick up a group because nobody
goes there. Places like the hole make this especially true as its
a "linear" entrance that isnt conducive to multiple groups (karnors,
seb, etc, you can fan out pretty quickly and not be getting on each
others toes).

A lot of it is just folk not having the time or energy to rol there
own but there are plenty of decent XP areas for the mid 50 game other
than sebilis; you just have to be a little motivated.

Thats my experience anyway. It might not be the "most efficient xp
modifier" zone, but then neither is being in a +2 billion percent xp
zone sitting at the zoneline getting +2 billion percent of zero xp.

Sirens is Ok now. DN is fun. Howling stones is also good, although
this one I admit you probably dont want a pickup group for - people
who already work well together can do pretty good though.

In karnors "suboptimal" groups of skilled players are just fine. I've
regularly run pickup groups through to the hands or other less busy areas
and survived all night without a death.

Karnors is a pretty easy zone if you can deal with the inept monk FD pull
trains and the like. It being outdoors and harmonyable means a hell of a lot
more viable puller/break classes than usual too.

Hell I put together a VSR raid with a pickup group basis and called in 
some friends to pad it out.

I've also found that if you walk up to groups and say "Hallo could you
let me know when you have a space?" to their faces and are friendly and
have demonstrated your ability to get there and back without slaughtering
everything and everyone enroute people are far more responsive than
if you're just another ooc'ing group seeker.

>Arena, but they generally dont' go too well.  BYOG.

BYOG doesnt mean you cant bring a pickup group though.

I can relate to that ;) Hopefully Luclins "single group" focus will alleviate
some of these issues though ;) We will see ;)

You know, LOTS of people are as fed up of the three zones you mention. try
just getting together an adequate group and going somewhere less "perfect".

You'll have more fun, and generally get better xp than waiting around and
competing with 60 other players all looking for the perfect group for that
extra 5% xp modifier. Killing at your groups speed with no concerns about
pull conflicts or externally imposed downtime can massively increase your
efficiency.
