Does anyone have a copy of a story from
http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/f orums/showthread.php?s=&thread id=17683
?

Was a really funny story called something like looking for love in
norrath.

Some qoutes

" Now on to magicians, well I know that magicians seem so mysterious
and alluring and they seem so handsome, well I am sorry to burst
another bubble girls but you must remember that they are THE pet class,
they can summon so many different pets and they have a pet for each
task. Well, when they have wined you and dined you and escorted you
home and been invited in for a 'cup of coffee'. You decide now is
the time and place and you scoot off to the bedroom to swap your
pulling gear for a few ounces of silk that cost more than the pulling
gear. Quick spray of perfume on the neck boobs and crotch. Pouty look
firmly in place and slow motion slink into the living room, and what do
you see? The horned beast elemental standing rampant next to your date.
You see girls, they have a pet to do everything for them!!! Was it any
good? Well, I suppose as rampant horny pets go it was quite good yes.
But afterwards it just poofed - no afterglow cuddle girls. Yes just
like most men really hehe."

"All the HEf-males I know walk around with their head in the clouds;
they have no time for romance at all. When we do get down to it, you
know what I mean; you can almost hear them checking the tick boxes on
the list. I mean, they are all casters - where is the magic?"
