Don't bother :).

Just spent a couple of hours trawling round Oxford Street and various places
(my poor feet, where's a druid when you want one), no-one has a copy. Only
place I discovered for certain actually stocks it is Electronics Boutique,
and they've sold out with no idea on when they are getting new stock in.

I may have to resort to ordering from Amazon and hoping those useless gits
at the Post Office manage to actually deliver on time for once...
