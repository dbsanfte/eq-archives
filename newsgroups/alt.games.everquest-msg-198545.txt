Finally got around to trying this. I had my sk cast vampiric embrace over 
and over.

On a normally regenerated mana bar:
Times cast    	19
Fizzled    	2
Mana left over  1%

I then pumped the mana song until the mana bar was full and tried it 
again:
Times cast    	19
Fizzled    	1
Mana left over  3%

From that, it seems the concensus, as I understood it, to be false. There 
didn't seem to be any phantom mana in evidence there.

I did one more test. I measured the time it took to regen a full bar of 
mana with and without mana pumping.

Mana pumping - 4 minutes, 40 seconds
Just letting the mana song play - 4 minutes 45 seconds

From that, it seems that the second piece as I understood it was correct. 
You only benefit from one mana song pulse per tick per bard. I *do* 
believe that multiple bards' mana songs effects will stack, but I have 
not been able to arrange that test.
