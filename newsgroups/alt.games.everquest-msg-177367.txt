Just idle curiosity, but it's interesting to imagine what kinds of monsters
he could solo if he were inclined to do it.  Gorenaire maybe?  Maybe not.
She's got 3 times his HP, but I'm thinking her AoE would be pretty useless
against his resists.  I just wonder how her teeth and claws would do against
that AC.  Being a wizard, I cannot remember the last time I was medding
close enough to a good fight to see all the battle spam -- it's been a
while.  The POD planes stuff, for example, has hit me for about 250 per
attack (and can do it twice), and those are the lightweights in there.  But
I have no clue what they hit well equipped warriors for because I am sitting
on my butt 50 feet away.

Anyway, as far as the imaginary battle between Furor and one of the old boss
monsters, once I saw how a few rounds went, it shouldn't be hard to guess
the winner.  Oh well, it's all just speculation at this point.  I couldn't
imagine how a fight like that would look, but I'd go far out of my way to
watch it.
