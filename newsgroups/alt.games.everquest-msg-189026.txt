My experience in Tox is minimal, but visit Misty Thicket sometime! Those
little KS'ers seem to actually follow you around waiting for you to get
the mob down to a sliver of health, then jump right in. Very
frustrating, but I imagine they are there for a reason, as in forcing
mobs to spawn when PC's are killing only one type of mob. Don't really
know for sure.
