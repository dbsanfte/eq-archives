*shrug* then I'll modify my statement a little bit.

What I said:
"As it is, the only classes that MUST be there to raid are warriors and
clerics.  Root works pretty danged well as a crowd control technique, and
clerics get that spell."

Modified:
As it is, for almost every raid all you need are lots of warriors, lots of
clerics and ONE shaman, ONE enchanter and maybe ONE monk.  The instances
where this is NOT true are the exceptions.

Hell, I don't like the facts any more than anyone who plays any of the other
classes, and thankfully it looks like Verant may make it less of a fact in
Luclin.  I don't know nearly enough about Luclin to have an opinion on it.
