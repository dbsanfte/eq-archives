I have a question or two. 

1. Was the bouncing aggro occuring on all pulls or mainly on the
multiple pulls?

2. When aggro was pulled from you, was it the one you fighting or one
of the others which was beating on you (as MT)?

It would appear to my inexpert eye that you, the other ranger, and the
bard tended to build up aggro at about the same rate. Hence, when one
got a bit ahead of the other, aggro shifted to that one and extra
effort from the others would shift it again, etc.

The cleric got pulled in possibly from the pacify activity before and
when supporting you by healing, maybe even over healing or other
casting.

Another thought: If the others were /Assisting you (as I understand is
the preferred method), then the other mobs were not necessarily
building up hate for you (or the other melees) at the same rate since
only the primary target was getting smacked, casted upon, and taunted,
so when a bard song (snare?) hit them or a cleric heal hit you, their
hate switched off you to a different target.

In a recent experience in Splitpaw, I have seen where several gnolls
get on the MT and the rest of us are beating on them (often as not
trying to /assist the MT) so not every gnoll is neccessarily getting
hit, then the shaman casts a spell and one of the gnolls (probably one
not getting hit) splits off the MT (and us) and runs at the shaman.


I think that the other ranger should have taken the time to work up
some hate from the other mobs by using snare and flame lick and
tangling weeds (as needed) before /assisting you. If aggro gets pulled
from one of the non/assist mobs, the other ranger grabs aggro from
whoever isn't supposed to have it and off-tanks until you, the monk,
and bard deal with the others.

Have no idea about the casters. What you went through sounded very
tough. Hate fighting casters.

My 2 coppers.
