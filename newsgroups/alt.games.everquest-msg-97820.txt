Well stated, Paul.  I quit EQ to try DAoC when it was first
released because I was sooo tired of the med 90%/fight 10%
grind.  I really wanted to love DAoC at the time since I
was bored with EQ.

However, I came-back to EQ simply due to the content.  Like
you said, EQ has a rich world with a mind-boggling array
of items and monsters, especially when compared to DAoC.

I know a couple friends who tried EQ even though they only
had a few hours per week to play, and they both quit simply
because the "grind" got to be so tedious (and they were not
even in hell levels yet!)

As we've seen, many people are quick to blame any posts about
"the time it takes to level" as "you're racing to 60 -- that's
not the game!"  Well, lemme say this:  fighting "a fire beetle"
or "a giant bat" a thousand times is not fun -- you must level
to be able to explore and try new things.  The game is fundamentally
about leveling.  Period.  Yeah, there is chatting, tradeskills,
and other things, but really, how much of the game (percentage)
could you explore and experience at level 5 or even 10?  You
must level.

So, while I'm not a lightweight gamer or a power gamer (I spend
maybe 20 hours per week playing), I'm all for the upcoming
changes simply because it will hopefully make the game slightly
less tedious (or, at least *seem* less tedious -- I have my
theory about how they're "fixing" the hell levels) for EVERYONE.

Mike
