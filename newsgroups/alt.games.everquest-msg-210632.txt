Which is, by definition, ironic. Rp players should embrace it because
it is what WOULD happen in such an adventuring-boom-town society.
It also DOES happen. You won't be selling bonechips for 20 plat each,
but you will easily sell them for 2 gold each (which equals 4 plat per
stack.) This is the role you'd have in such a trickle down, real
adventuring boom town society. It isn't charity at all, it is simply
supply and demand. This is a very real role.
