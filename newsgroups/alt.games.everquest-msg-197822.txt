Two (similarly anecdotal) arguments against that:

(1) Years back when Lanys T'Vyl opened, there were over 250 people in
GFay, so many that the video lag made it look more like a slide show
than animation.  So much going on that you literally could not tell if
you were KSing somebody or vice versa until after the mob was dead.
Yet there was no effect that I could see on mob spawn times.

(2) They obviously got their hardware planning right this time around,
Stromm has been at the top of the population ranking every time I've
logged on since it opened.  Zones with decent under-20 content have
been full of players 24x7.  Yet I've not seen mobs be slow to pop
anywhere, not even in North Qeynos where there are often 100+ mob
corpses litterring the landscape (I've no idea why so many are left
laying there, only zone I've seen it in).
