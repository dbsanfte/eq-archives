OK martin, you've said what you think the most useless are, but what are
your mose useful? For me, it would depend on what you want to use them for,
but I assume you're talking in the grander scheme of things (not just raid
use, but a mix of all the things we do in EQ).

I have to admit that I don't know all my epics that well. On the "useful"
side, two that I see as pretty darn useful are:

Cleric: OK, usually no biggie, but manaless rezzes make a huge difference in
a wipeout situation. Even in a non-wipe out, they can be big when you
realize that a rez takes up about 20% of the mana pool of my guild's top
cleric (a 57 - we would probably be considered lower end of middle tier on
raid power). If you're in a place that has little to know down time, then
allowing individual rezzes while having the cleric still up for the "normal"
responsibilities in a big one.
Bard: At least through the 50's, there is a possitively massive difference
between an epic'd versus a non-epic'd Bard IMHO. The Bard epic allows the
bard to become a much more viable secondary melee without a huge lost in
their other output (chants, mana, group heal over time/stamina, mana, etc.,
etc., etc,). They take the loss on extra instrument bonus from good
instruments, but still get the basic instrument bonus. Then theirs the proc
of the extremely nice group haste, which, if they play Katta's, will be
procing quite regularly. Just me, but I think an epic'd part jumps his/her
"effective level" buy probably 5 levels or more at least through 60. Very
much changes the character of groups the bard is in too.
Ranger: Really, I see this as the "pair" being useful. One or the other of
them has something to offer just about all the time.

Note that I'm still pretty much a newb in this crowd at a scant 48, but
those are the couple that I notice.
