    We have one former member of our guild that just likes to have fun. He's
the one that, after we'd killed Cursed, would train all the iksar on us
while shouting "ARMY OF NINDAIL, TO VICTORY!"

    Last night, because nothing was up, we did a ring war for a warrior.
After about the third time of explaining to folks that all the mobs in the
zone would depop, we see the shout "ARMY OF NINDAIL, TO VICTORY!" Next thing
we see is a little purple gnome wizard running at us with what looked like
every frost giant in the zone, and maybe eight giant-factioned wolves as
well. That was one way to depop the zone! The best part was when we'd killed
most of them, and he shouted "ARMY OF NINDAIL, RETREAT!"
