You may want to check out doing the Thurgadin shawl quest
up to the 3rd part to get the Seal of Thoridain for the ranged slot.
Damn nice item and you just need high baking skill.

http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=4565

> Jarsath Scale Guants

Get some Gauntlets of the Black. Easy to get.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3837

> Girdle of Dilligent

Nice.

> Gatorscale Leggings

Do the Kromrif Military leggs quest.

> 2x forest loop
> Chrysoberyl Talisman

Do the Badge quest in Qeynos. The 3rd and 4th badges are damn nice.

http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/qsearch.html?zone=4

> Kobold Hide Boots

Get some Golden Efreeti Boots.

> Cloak of Rygor Oracles

Get a mammoth hide cloak or if you know a high skill
tailor see if you can get a Cobalt drake cloak.

> Bloodstained Tunic

I think you must worship Tunare, so you can wear Imbued cultural chain armor.
If you know or can find a high skill elf smith.

Imbued Elven Chainmail Tunic 14     +5 wis  +5 int   +2 cha    +2 magic    1.5wt

> Plat Ruby Veil

Might as well go to Velium here.

> Guardian Helmet

Very nice.

> Adamantite Eqaulets

> Bone Armplates

Those suck bad. Yes they add +5 str but they weigh 5.0 as well so you
are not really gaining anything. Get Ulthork hide arms here at least.

> Runed Mythral Bracer

I'd have the Bracers of the Reverant here because the AC is
higher but I understand that the high-elf may need the STR bonus.

> Sentry Bracers

> Plat Jasper Ring
> Spiked Goblin Ring

Decent rings but I'd opt for either Velium Jasper Rings or
Velium Jade Rings. Unless you need the strength.
