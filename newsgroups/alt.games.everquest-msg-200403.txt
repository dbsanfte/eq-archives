What you're describing could very well be the case, but if it is, it is
inconsistant with all of the other flags.

If you use the 85% rule to skip the 3 trials (allow access to Mith Marr) and
kill Mith Marr, you're still not considered to have killed him for the
purposes of moving beyond, until you go back and catch up the 3
pre-requisites you're missing.


It's the "(toss in whatever if any other flags required here)" part.   In
every other PoP flagging situation, the Sol Ro Mini (prerequisite) flags
would be incuded in that catagory.  In this situation it's looking like they
might not be, for some reason.
