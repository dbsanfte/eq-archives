Anyone else noticed nasty lag in LDoN's lately? Well, it acts like lag, 
only worse, and I only mention LDoN's, because I haven't seen it anywhere 
else.

Mobs will flat out warp around the room - not merely casters, but *any* 
mobs. They just disappear from in front of me and I have to spin around to 
find them, not necessarily on someone else, just in a different location.

I frequently find myself just turned in a different direction. This often 
happens when moving straight forward, I'll suddenly be spun around 180 
degrees. It's a real pain when you tag a mob and start leading it back to 
the group, only to be spun around to face it and run right back into it. It 
also happens when stationary, wailing on a mob. I'll just be spun varying 
degrees from my current perspective.

I'm aware of situations where one might begin turning before standing up 
completely and therefore the turn happens all at once when you get up and 
things like that, but this isn't like that. If I push my forward button, it 
shouldn't spin me to the opposite direction under any circumstances.
