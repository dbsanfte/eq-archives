... until I created my first one this week.  I was fine as long as I roamed
around Paineel, but as soon as I left town I realized that NOBODY in Erudin
liked me, so I hopped on the boat and went to Queynos.  As soon as I stepped
off the boat, the guards killed me.  LOL!

So, all of you experienced Necros out there, is this just the way life is
going to be for me from now on?  Or is there some faction-improving that I
can do to prevent my sudden death?  Do I need to avoid towns alltogether?

My current plan is to buy "Gather Shadows" and make myself invisible before
I try to return to Queynos.  Perhaps I can sneak underground and be accepted
there.
