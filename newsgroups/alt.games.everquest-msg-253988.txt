So after years of playing every other MMORPG out there, I finally 
decided to give EQ a whirl because of the free 30-day trial. So far, it 
is much more fun than I expected it to be, but, I feel so lost due tot 
he sheer depth of the content.

My question is, can someone give me a quick rundown of all the various 
expansions? Also, do any of the expansions upgrade the graphics?

Thanks,
Zach
