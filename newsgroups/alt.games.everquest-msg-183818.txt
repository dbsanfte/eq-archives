Is Play Vashaaa server or what ever it is called and its seem like every 10
minutes the Bazaar is crashing if not the entire sever. This just start
since they did the patch this afternoon, ever since I log in and I drop to
hte desk top with in 10 minutes.


 When I log back in there is only like 100 people so I am presuming this
happening to other people.

Is anyone else experiencing this? Any Ideas what is going on?
