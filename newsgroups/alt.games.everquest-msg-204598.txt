You seem to think that "dynamic content" equals "magically fresh and 
interesting every time" content. This is not the case. People will catch 
up on the vagaries of the RNG that generates the "dynamic" content so 
fast that it will feel just as the static content pretty soon. If you 
don't believe me, just play the first level of Diablo a few times, and 
tell me if it doesn't feel samey after a while.

I think EQ has *exactly* the right approach... Hand-crafted content, 
refreshed every few months. I only wish they would do zone revamps to *
all* zones, and a bit more often... Even turning high-level areas into 
low or medium level areas, and keep people migrating around.
