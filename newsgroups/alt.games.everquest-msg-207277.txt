I find my self being the agro spung in caster heavy groups all the time.
  I normaly have my spell bar set up like this.

Life Draw                        -   63 Mana  - Mild Agro
Engulfing Darkness        -   60 Mana  - High Agro   - only if no slower in
group
or
Clinging Darkness          -   20 Mana  - High Agro   - Slower lets me get
it off first
                                             and when i dee the dot damage
end i know that they have
                                             slowed the mob.
Siphon Strength              -     5 Mana  - Good Agro  -  All debufs are
good to high agro.
                                             The stronger the debuf the more
agro.
Despair                           -    12 Mana  - Mild - Good Agro - See
above
Wave Of Enfeeblement -    40 Mana  - Good - High Agro - See above
Heat Blood                    -     72 Mana  - Mild Agro -  Rairly get to
use it. By the time I get
                                             a chance the mob is at 20-40 %
health and it would be a waist.
Shadow Step                  -    10 Mana - Escape Tool
Feign Death                   -    60 Mana - Escape Tool

I always pull with siphon strength, if I get more than one I can Feign and
not worry about there being a dot on the mob. If only one cones I cast
Darkness and go back to the group. While beating on the mob I am Dashing,
and Supper Taunting (taunt macro with a beg added in there).  Normaly we can
down a mob before i loose agro, but once in a while i will  see the mob run
after a nuker ( bad nuker, bad ) and will cast Wave of enfeeblement. It only
has like a 15 foot radius so make sure no other non rooted mobs are around.
When it hits the mob it jumps right back on me. (yes Enfeeblement and Siphon
stack...  Love it in PvP- Siphon, Enfeeblement, darkness and Heat blood.
step back and re aply heat blood as necisary. most players let them selfs
get to there max weight limit, and when you take 25 strength from them they
will be encumbered.---  Well acording to lucy they don't, but I duled a
member of my guild to find out if they stacked and he said his strength went
down 25 points.  Maybe it is a Zek thing)
