Personally I applaud the new expansions.  It means that I can explore
the old Norrath in peace and quiet.

I am still running characters at about the level 20 mark as there is
still so much to see and do.   Now that everyone has vanished off to
the Planes a lot of the other areas becomes more interesting.

For the last few days my level 13 mage has been wrestling with the
wildlife on Erud's Island (okay, visiting the Soulbinder more times
than intended) and often I am the only one in the whole zone for days.

Even the Karanas have become interesting since PoP was released.  The
creatures are all fully popped and it now an interesting challenge to
cross these lands with a low level character.  Before everything was
killed and now it's a fun sprint, take shelter and hide between
sightings of griffons.   The uber-port mechanism of PoP has made
places like the Karanas into more of a backwater which means that we
get areas which seem harder to reach.  Which, of course, they are not;
it's just that other areas have become far too easy to come to.

On the flip side of the coin I took my level 38 rogue (my main) into
the Dreadlands.   As a playing experience it was awful.  Characters
were lined up on 'the ledge' and pulling and slaying; it was the role
playing equivilent of pheasant shooting.  Some people may say that
Dreadlands is (pardon me as I move into juvenile-speak) "kewl and
offers lewt" but that, to me, isn't what the game is about.

I expect that there will be more and more expansions (there are
already rumours of 'Lost Dungeons of Norrath') and these will be for
more and more high levels who want instant gratification.  Which is
great as it means that those of us who want to enjoy the colour and
texture of Norrath and Luclin will be able to do so.
