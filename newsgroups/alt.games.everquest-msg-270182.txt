There is a "Betrayal quest" which you can do in your mid-teens (but
which must be done before 17, I think) which will change your
allegience to that of the opposing city, at which point, you are not
welcome in your original home. This is required for some race/class
combinations -- troll paladin, for example, or halfling necromancer. 

There is definitely faction-raising in the game; you get messages
about it all the time. The effect of this are not known to me at this
time, but that may be because I haven't changed it enough to matter.
(Gnolls hate me -- big whup. The Far Seas Trading Company loves me,
but they haven't given me any quests they don't give to others.)
