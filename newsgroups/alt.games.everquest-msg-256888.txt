    I'll talk to our officers, see if we can't plug this leak. ;-)

    Drat. They're casters, so sometimes they cast instead of meleeing. I
love it when they do that!

    When we were doing Zun, we didn't bother with any mobs along the way.
The area in front of the big door to the Zun room is a safe spot, so if we
went back that would be our likely drag point.

    Yeah, that. We tried it one day, never really got the progress we
wanted, decided nothing the event could drop would make it worthwhile, and
never came back. Well, not quite true - we used the room as a safe room once
on a day where the server crashed and that room hadn't repopped yet.

    We've got the first big boss in Tacvii down to where we've seen all her
tricks, and have an implementable strat in response. Just need to actually
get the people online to finish her, and get me the mask I've been drooling
over all week!
