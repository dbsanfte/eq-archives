I'm not sure of that. It seems to me that the question marks are a bit
seperate from the resource nodes. I've gone into areas and cleared the
resources several times without spawning any question marks. Spent 3
or 4 hours harvesting one day in TS and no question marks spawned in
the area I was harvesting. I've seen them in that area at other times
but if I cleared them and they didn't spawn in a few minutes they were
gone until cleared in another area.
