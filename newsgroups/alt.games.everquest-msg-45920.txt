Where does it drop you in EJ? If it's the same spot, you've been
insanely lucky. I hosted a raid to CoM and had to escort a bunch of
folks from the Druid drop point in EJ to the CoM zone. In one afternoon
we got jumped at least four times at the zone in. Usually a trakoraptor
(sp?) but I think one of the ape species as well.
