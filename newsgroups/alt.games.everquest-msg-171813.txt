Two are based on DPS...  if your not a DPS intensive group then look at the
other trials...  they aren't really any tougher.

When I do the trial (monk+shaman) my shaman is generally the tank..  MA
picks mob, shaman casts tigers (ae slow) then happily "tanks" the mobs while
the cleric heals, and the melees pick 1 off at a time.
