I'm just wondering, can you tell me how you were able to raise your OT
outpost faction to amiable?  From what I understand, that is the
Venril Sathir faction and the only way to raise that faction, besides
killing some certain high-level dragon type mobs, is to do the Sarnak
Warbraid quest with Captain Rottgrime, which you can't do if you're
KOS.  I thought Iksars started off KOS at outpost and so would never
be able to be non-KOS?
