Crystal Caverns is good if you can get a group.  Lots of good-for-plat velium weapons drop
there, as well as the occasional frozen long sword and robes and foreman's skull cap.
XP is good since it is a dungeon and you get some bonus (I think).  Another cool thing, is
if you can manage to fight your way to
the bottom, there is a bank and several merchants you can sell to (but have to use
Charimatic Carrillion to avoid being dubious to them).  You can also invis your way down
quite safely with sonorous clouding.

The group's casters will love her there... Amp + 8x Chorus of Clarity is better than C3!
