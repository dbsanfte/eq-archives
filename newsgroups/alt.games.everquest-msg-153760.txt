Farm or buy a couple of BPs full of Crushbone belts, transfer them to your
gnome and do the quest in BB.  I did this with a gnome wizard I made.  I was
really curious to see how far I could get her on CB belts.  I think I had
around 24 belts and 4 Lego pads.  I turned them all in at 1st level and the
experience from the quest took her all the way to 6th level. 6th!-now THATS
a hell level!!!!
