433,000? But wait that can't be right, we have our own 'reliable'
'inside' news source that says EQ is less than half of 400,000.

Heh heh. No shit. Can you say 'cash cow?' Sure I knew you could.

Wow. Huge potential for growth. The mind staggers at the money to be made.

No shit. Half the people in my guild are over 30 with kids.

Aint that the truth. But then again the same thing happens in bars.
The bars just provide the place and the booze.

LOL. I wonder if the real reason the market crashed was people
pulling out their cash to play games. =)

Wait. No no no. EQ is dying. Didn't you hear?

Holy fuck. Wow $1 million just from moving a few files from one
computer to another. Nice work if you can get it. Gives new
meaning to the phrase "Money for Nothing." Hey Smed do you
get your chicks for free as well?

Wait how can EQ fund other projects if its dying? Hmmm starting
to think our EQ 'insider' may be full of shit.

Hmm. Think this might keep EQ going for a while? Nah, I keep forgetting
its dying.

True. But Everquest brings it in month after month. Steady cash flow
is a good thing. Not bad for just keeping a bunch of computers turned on
and the ISP bill paid.

Man can't wait to see what's next.

EQ will be dead some day but it aint going to be tomorrow.
