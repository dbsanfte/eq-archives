Exp groups where I am the only healer? Exp groups where the cleric
doesn't have aego? Exp groups where insert-class-here doesn't have its
own mana regen yet? If three people in the group want it, PotG is
cheaper, and if the mage and cleric want to cry about it, one cast of
PotC costs significantly more mana than their self buffs + heroism.

Yes, the single target is handy for all those other cases.
