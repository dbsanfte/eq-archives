I have a beastlord as well and this is one problem I have not run into yet with
my pet.  Probably the ONLY problem I haven't had.  It could be a pathing problem
where your pet gets "lost" when it loses sight of you, but I doubt it.   I
usually dismiss my warder in towns anyway and don't re summon until I am about
to enter a battle.
