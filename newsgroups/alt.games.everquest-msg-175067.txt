What exactly are the windstones for?  For Acrylia armor you need acrylia and
superb rockhopper hides to get to 188 with studded, then flawless hides to
get to 242.  Windstones are for smithing.

Personally, I would go with whichever you find easier to gather components
for.  Velious armor will give you skillups, even at 177, and the hides are
quite farmable.
