Well, they don't advertise it, true.  Temp is the buff of coice for levels 
1-44, Virtue is the choice for 48-65.  Those other three levels aren't a 
large enough target audicence to warrant their own ad.  Many of them may 
have aego if you ask... Although the small target audience also leads many 
to not bother even getting the spell. :)

Thanks for that, I didn't even realize SLN had HP regen. :)

Replenishment doesn't last all that long, but 20 mins at 40 HP/tic is 
nothing to sneeze at.

Someone else mentioned VQ/Speed of Vallon, at 42 minutes... dunno if those 
will stick at 45 for sure.  But Visions of Grandeur should stick, and has 
the same duration.

Yes, very long.  After raids, when I sit somewhere, that cute pink heart 
is still around an hour after everything else. :)

Spirit of the Predator might be good, if you find a ranger.
