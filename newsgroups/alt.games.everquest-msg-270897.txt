You have a point but it is not a realistic one. SOE is not going to 
change. Therefore, while they should do things to address what is 
happening on the servers now, we both know they are not going to do that 
any time soon enough to deal with this guy's problem.

And so, no it isn't ridiculous if it is worth it to him personally and 
that question can only be answered by the original poster, not you or I. 
I simply suggested that it could be worthwhile. If it was me in that 
position I would do it and pay the fee because I really enjoy the game. 
The guy has something like eight toons, all into at least their 40's if 
I recall with some higher level ones. That's a lot of time invested, 
particularly if you really like playing them and want to carry on with them.

Sure, you can argue about whether the fee should exist or not but that 
isn't the issue here. It does exist and if he wants to keep those toons 
and play this game, that's a way to do it. Bitching about the fee being 
ridiculous or telling him to go play another game doesn't help the guy 
solve his problem.

I'm sure it's already occured to him that there are a dozen other games 
on the MMORPG market he could leave EQ for and start over again with. 
But it sounded to me like he was lamenting the fact that he couldn't 
play EQ anymore on his server for lack of groups. A character transfer 
solves that problem. Moving to WoW or some other game does not. Well, it 
could I suppose as long as he didn't care about leaving EQ behind.

By the way, I agree with you that it should not cost a player money to 
transfer to another server or to rename his toons for that matter. 
Particularly when the problem is because the player population is 
shrinking. Given how much we pay to play and the profit being made on 
this game, I think they could offer such services for free too. After 
all, how hard is it to copy some files from one server to another and 
perhaps modify a configuration file that keeps all the names on the 
server or whatever. And how difficult would it be to make that procedure 
a painless automated one?

In fact, I think they ought to roll out the Legends server functionality 
to all the EQ servers and they ought to make Station Players available 
for EQ1 too. It would cost them next to nothing to do this I would think 
as most of the work has already been done and it would enhance EQ1 a 
good deal.

But I wouldn't hold my breath for any of that.

Oh, and while we are discussing the ridiculous. It pisses me off they 
are charging $2.99 for the Station Players package to be complete. Not 
that they care or it will change. I don't like the way SOE nickels and 
dimes their customers either.

Just my two coppers.
