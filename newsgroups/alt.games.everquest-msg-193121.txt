Not if they won some contest.  People win contests all the time, I dont hold
it against them.  Plus I am sure there are people getting free cable because
the know someone at the cable company, or free channels, whatever.  If you
let that kind of thing bother you, you'd be up all night.  Someone is always
getting a better deal than you, somewhere.

I agree all customers should be treated equally, and I think that they were
here, assuming everyone who went to Fan Faire could have participated in
whatever it was this guy did to win.
