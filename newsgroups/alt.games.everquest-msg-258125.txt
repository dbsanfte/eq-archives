And that's what may not be true for much longer. The abominable
Launchpad addition that was on Test (briefly) uses the registry for
identifying paths. Without it, it doesn't run. As it was, it was
running from the same folder even if you had more than one, which was
a problem.

They've removed it due to major problems though. I expect it'll come
back... advertising and all. Going to make patching that much suckier
(and you have to log in *before* patching).
