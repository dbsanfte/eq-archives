The curve plateaus out, not sure at what point as yet, but the person with 
1200 AA will still end up moving through the higher volume of AA sooner than 
the person playing catch up. With the number and spectrum of classes 
changing as some players go into semi-retirement, this will allow the 
remaining people to group more effectively whether it be with new mains or 
support alts.

Not such a bad idea if SOE want to stabilise the player base and content 
access.
