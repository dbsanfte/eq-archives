Zek servers mean you can be PKed (player killed) by idiots.  All non-Zek
servers are PvE (player versus environment...critters) only.

Of the non-Zek servers, if you have real life friends that play ask them
where they are.  If not, it really doesn't matter much.

www.allakhazam.com
http://eq.castersrealm.com

Both of those sites have player creation guides.  Don't ask us what you
should be...only you and your psychic can answer that question for you.
