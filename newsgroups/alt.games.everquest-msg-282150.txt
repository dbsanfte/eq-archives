Me either....with the dupes etc around, a minority buying plat makes no
difference anyway, and really, helps keep EQ alive no matter how holy people
try and act about it.

If I was starting from zero, with empty newbie zones, I may want to buy plat
/ characters to get a leg up.

Then again, I am having fun playing SoD as a total noob, so maybe not.

People buying plat et all helps eq more than it hurts it though, in its
current state.
