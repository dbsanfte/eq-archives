That is not doable. Even if you did not have server lag because of
that you'd have too many people wanting to do the same stuff. Anarchy
Online tried to do the same thing and rapidly found that just the
players being overcrowded in the same zone lagged them incredibly.

I really don't put much stock in an mmorpg maker who has not even
figured that out yet.

"How can everyone play on a single server, when others games have many
servers? 
As a next generation game, Boundless Adventures will be unlike any of
the other online games. Due to the way that the game world is
constructed, and maintained, the world will be large enough to support
several hundred thousand players on at once"

Sure, until they all decide that they want to be in Omni 1 at the same
time... I guess it works well on paper though. A good base for mmorpg
design should be that players are never going to do what you want them
to do and are going to do exactly what you don't want them to do.


>Will be interesting to see if this becomes reality someday.

Would be more interesting if they were actually beyond the terrain
engine stage. Really you know who does this "we have an mmorpg!" thing
right? The only company I've ever seen it done right with was
blizzard. Blizzard comes out saying "we have an mmorpg announcement,
oh and here is its websites and here is some IN GAME shots of the
various player types fighting creatures oh and here is an in game
movie of some orc players en masse, etc and so on."

AHAH just found the concept art which looks kind of like it was drawn
by a 14 year old with some colored pencils during study hall:

I'm getting a Dawn kind of vibe. Everyone says they have the next
generation thing which is so great but then they come out with DAOC or
perhaps something much worse. I'm really not sure if some of these
"companies" have taken a look at the Worlds of Warcraft or Star Wars
Galaxies sites; EQ, DAOC and UO are not going to be the competition of
new MMORPGS being announced now so being "next generation" is moot.
Its all next generation now.
