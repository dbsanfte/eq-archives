I am sure this has been beat to death but it came up in a group last night
and I didn't have an answer. We know Verant in their infinate wisdom Nerfed
the Exp off of lower level mobs post 50. Group consists of 1 60 Warrior 1 60
Monk 1 54 Shaman 1 52 Druid and a 49 Cleric. We are in The Grey killing mobs
50-55 (I guess). The Cleric asks that being he is grouped with 60s is his
exp been cut down (due to the Nerf)beside the normal share % loss (higher
the level the bigger the exp share)
