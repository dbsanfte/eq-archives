Root parking in Veksar last night.  Actually, I was casting Marks on
the mob, the shaman was rooting it.  Whichever one of us did it last
got chain summoned until the melee types had their mob done.  Nothing
we cast actually caused damage to the mob.

So, I don't think doing any damage is a pre-req to get summoned.
Seems to all be aggro list.
