}>one by one the charges against David Koresh

}by the way, could we get a cite on this?
}that would be from a <responsible source>....

Most of my opinions on the matter were formed by watching a movie called 
Waco: The Rules of Engagement.  Normally, one would cite facts.  I don't 
think, in this case, that there is more than opinion left after both sides 
have hidden evidence and told lies.  But the PBS site I referred to in the 
other post was quite informative.  Do a bit of research, form your own 
opinion, but don't ask me for facts, I doubt they'll ever be found.

There's quite a few interesting links here:

Heh.  There are no facts left, only FAQs. :)

This one was particularly interesting:
