Yes this is a more and more popular way to powerlevel a twink. I see eight
bearskin potion bags full of greater lightstones for sale at auctions all
the time. Average price is around $300.00 cold hard cash.
Or, you could just twink over eight bags of rat ears and level the cheap way
in Qeynos Hills at the lake. Hand over one at a time to be grilled by
Rapyhl(spelling?) and hand the grilled rat ear back to him for a low level
spell or fish scales. This is a two-for-one exp and cash gainer. There is no
easier and SAFER way to powerlevel a character up to level 5. Even with the
druid damage shields and buffs you can overpull or have a nasty griffon
spawn right on top of you. No amount of armor or buffs will save you from
him.
