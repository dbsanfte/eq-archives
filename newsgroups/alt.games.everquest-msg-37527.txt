I was playing in the Lake of ill omen,and I was groupd with a lizard monk .
I am 19 level and he was 17..I am human monk.
As we were fighting the MOBS I really noticed that he was  very fast.. he
even had more moves or so it seemed.
I was slow and by the way it seems I am getting slower..
the last 2 levels... (could be my imagination.)
I ask him how it was that he was soo fast and he said"wu's Pants and
guantlets and tunic..
Well I have Wu's Guantlets and pure silk ge and leather
pants....and I know I need to get Wu's gear.. But is that the reason I am so
much slower than him???
I did notice he was taking alot more damage than myself.
thank you all... and to every one a safe week-end.
