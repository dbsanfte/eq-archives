Your character was not looking up high enough...

When your stamina bar runs out and your STA stat is under 100 you
will slow down a bit.  When you are in water you slowly sink, to
counter this you must be swimming upwards.  When you slow down the
up part of your movement vector is reduced proportionately along
with the horizontal part, so if you were barely moving up enough
to keep you head out of water before your stamina ran out you will
start to sink.  You will get same effect by losing a movement speed
buff (SoW wearing off) or adding encumbrance (taking heavy item(s)
out of weight reducing containers, don't think this matters until
your weight exceeds your STR).  So, if you don't want to sink and
you may slow down, either look way up or sit there until you slow
down and adjust as necessary (I used to wait until my stamina bar
ran out and I was sure I was staying afloat before risking an AFK
while swimming).
