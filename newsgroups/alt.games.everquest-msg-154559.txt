Taellaar's an agnostic DE rogue, Ryou is an Innoruuk worshipping DE
necro.  I can't remember the factions, but it was a one-faction drop
for each of them - I made them both get their own robes :).  So no,
you wouldn't want to do this too many times with the same character.
:)  Remember not to bother doing it for a character that the robe
won't show up on - had a level 2 cat begging me to kill her again for
him and I told him no way jose - don't mind them looking at me askance
but that's as far as I'm going for now.  Of course then, after looking
at the item which clearly said 'no drop' on it, and which I'd just
mentioned coming all the way there to kill, he asked if I needed the
one I had on... 9_9

I've found the best place to hunt this little girl is by going into
the castle and immediately turning right, and going down towards the
BL trainers - there's a big open room with three sellers on one side
and three sellers on another, and just before that quite a few stairs
- I sit at the bottom of the stairs and keep an eye on the screen
while reading a book.  She's a fairly fast pop, don't think I waited
more'n ten or fifteen minutes for her either time.  There's some
argument as to whether the guards will aggro if you attack her, so I
just played it safe and waited until she was alone.  She only takes
about 2 seconds to kill.
