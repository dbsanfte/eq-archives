That wouldn't have done any good - They have no proof she
KS'd.  The only way a GM can determine if they're doing it
is to show up and observe them in the act.  Obviously she
won't need to do it again - you only need one cloak for the
epic.  That could be why she acted as she did after they
accused her of KS'ing - that way there is no evidence to 
/report.
