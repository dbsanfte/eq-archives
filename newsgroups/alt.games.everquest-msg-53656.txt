Yes! He's right!! You should give up EQ right this minute!  Particularly
if you are one of those bastards who's constantly camping in Seb and
Velks so nobody else can get a decent spot! Save yourselves now, quit,
and go do something else!!!!! 
(well.... at least until I get all the gems for my vellious armor
anyway.)

A poor troll. Weak structure, unoriginal, and unlikely to draw even a
half dozen bait-takers.
