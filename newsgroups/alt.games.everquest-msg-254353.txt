I know its been beat to death, but I still have a hard time figuring out 
  how to compare weapons.

I've been using a 22/44 two hander, at level 29 that gives  me a 4 
damage bonus

I picked up an Exectioner's Axe, which is 25/50, at level 29 a 7 damage 
bonus.

Now the formula I've seen mentioned many times is [(damage * 
2)+bonus]/delay.

If that's accurate, then the claidmore is at a 1.09 while the Axe is at 
1.14, even though you'd think the two were more or less identical based 
solely on the ratio.

All things being equal, I like the axe, as I think its more fitting for 
a berserk than some sword, plus it procs a haste buff (duration all of 3 
tics, sadly) fairly frequently which should help a bit when soloing 
unbuffed, or grouped with no haster.

I understand that the slower the weapon the harder it is to skill up 
with, but since the only weapon skill I'm using is 2hs, thats really not 
much of a problem, both 2hs and Offense are always capped by the time I 
level, so I've only got to clear 5 a level in each.  Double attack is a 
bit more problematic, but its been going up faster than 5 points a level 
and I expect will catch up soon.

Another plus with the bigger slower weapon is that it will do more 
damage on a riposte... at level 30 I just got Riposte, so it should be 
fun to see that start to work.  For a class thats' not designed as MT 
material, I seem to spend an awful lot of my time being "IT" for the mobs.
