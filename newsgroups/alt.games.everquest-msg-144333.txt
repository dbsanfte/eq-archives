Wolfie, you are so hung up on the word "hate" that you can't see the 
forest for the trees. A crime is considered a "hate" crime when, even 
though it's carried out against one particular individual, it's 
considered to have targeted an entire social group. As such, these 
crimes are deemed to be more damaging to the fabric of society that 
ordinary crimes, and they are dealt with accordingly.

Not all crimes where the victim belongs to a particular ethnic group, 
religion or sexual orientation are hate crimes, and in fact, I believe 
the standards of what it's considered a "hate" crime are extremely 
strict. A person wouldn't be automatically convicted of a hate crime 
even if they happen to indeed *hate* the victim.

A parallel can be drawn with terrorism... Murder is murder, but a murder 
can be classified as terrorism (and be dealt with accordingly) if, while 
the victim is one given individual, the intended target is the 
destabilization of the State or society as a whole.
