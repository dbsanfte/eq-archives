Halfling druid, right?

Druids don't have quest armor until velious, and not much in the way
of questable gear otherwise. Your best bets are the testament of
vanear quest (Qeynos/Highpass) and the shakey's stuffing quest
(Qeynos/Rivervale/West Karana/Feerrott) which has two different
rewards, both good for a halfling druid. You might also want to look
up the acolyte's anklet quest in Rivervale for a foot slot item.

You're a tailor, so lay off the store-brought stuff. Stockpile ruined
wolf pelts and cat pelts and buy patterns. Use the ruined cat pelts to
skill up making patchwork armor, and use ruined wolf pelts to make
your own armor. Much cheaper than storebought leather, and just as
good for your needs. The first upgrade you should be able to afford is
a pair of splitpaw gloves - if you stick your nose into South Karana
and auction, you might be able to get gloves for maybe 15 pp and tunic
for 5 or 10 (it's better than patchwork)

I'd add latest heal spell to that lineup, and possibly gate. I
wouldn't waste a spell slot on keeping the thistlecoat spell
memorized, I've always swapped that in as needed. The only time I have
buffs memmed constantly is if I am in a group where I am buffing and
don't have anything more constructive to do with a spell slot - the
only exception being spirit of wolf, which I have memmed ALL the time
and sometimes even forget to swap out in dungeons where I can't cast
it :) Heal and sow are the lifesavers, the others aren't.

Bear in mind that you might have to get creative with healing at this
low level - I always put damage shields on melees so I'd have to heal
them less, and keep the mobs snared so they can be outrun if need be.
Remember you are not a wizard: nuke, but don't limit yourself to that.

There is a trainer at the North Karana druid ring as well, Briana with
the bear pet IIRC.

A level 20 tailor wants ruined pelts. Go after cats, bears, wolves and
make armor of their pelts - you'll be able to wear the stuff made from
wolf pelt. Be careful killing bears and wolves near surefall, and do
not kill anything inside surefall.

Cheap alternatives include runed totem staff (2hb, available in
blackburrow and south karana) and darkwood staff (1hb, quested with a
lambent stone from rathe mountains, quest in temple of sol ro). You
can also use velium morning stars and velium staffs.
