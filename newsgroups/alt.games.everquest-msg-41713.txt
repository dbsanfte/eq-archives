i took my half elf ranger (15th) over to the warrens recently, checked
stonebrunt but needed a full group out there most red to me

went right between the guards in the newbie area of paineel on the first and
every subsequent time, no camo or anything

conned as kos but never agroed them once, nor the other necro out there
either, after a toatl of maybe 5 hours in the warrens i am now dubious to
said heretics
