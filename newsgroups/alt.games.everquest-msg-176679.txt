You did hear that right, although why fearkiting needed to be specifically
broken on 54+ mobs while other soloing spells and abilities aren't is a
mystery.
SK, if soloing after fear becomes unusable tend to revert to 'mundane'
kiting with a pet up. Most of the time, it's easier to get a group -
especially now that people are beginning to realise that both the Knight
hybrids are better at aggro control in xp groups than a lot of warriors.
