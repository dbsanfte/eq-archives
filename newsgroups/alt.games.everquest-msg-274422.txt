Irrelevant to the topic at hand? Sure -- since you've changed the topic
at hand and then applied my comments out of context to this new topic.
This is now the 2nd time you've misrepresented my arguments, and then
condescendingly called them irrelvant.  If you're not going to deal
with my posts as they were originally written, in their original
context, then please don't respond.

Here is a paraphrase of my original argument in one sentence:

If Blizzard billed Dennis for a month of service but deliberately
witheld service for 72 hours of that month by claiming a TOS violation,
and Dennis can prove that he did not actually violate the TOS, then he
may be entitled to a prorated refund of that time.

Sure that comes to maybe $1.50 but the point was in answer to the slew
of people saying he had no recourse *no matter what*.  I just think he
might have, if the suspension can be proven to be unjustified.

If you want to argue against that, be my guest.  But please stop
misquoting me.  Suspension is not termination and I've never said a
word about account banning or termination.
