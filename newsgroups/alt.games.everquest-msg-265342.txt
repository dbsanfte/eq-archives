OK, so Clinton's boom was Reagan's doing, Bush's crash is Clinton's 
doing, but Carter's malaise was... Carter's doing?

No, I don't think Carter's 4 years were great, but I thought he was an 
acceptable president; I never felt embarassed to have him as president, 
he always struck me as a decent guy, but he couldn't get much done 
because he wasn't good at manipulating the hardcore partisan politicians 
he was up against in congress.

Clinton, on the other hand, was scum, and it was embarassing to have him 
as president, I voted against him the first time.  But he did a great 
job, manipulated the hell out of everyone, and only an outlandishly 
hardcore hellfire spitting core managed to stick any dirt to him at 
all... even that eventually washed out having wasted tons of time and 
megatons of cash.  I voted for him the second time, I still feel a 
little slimy for having done so because he was still scum... but 
effective scum.

The Ideal is a man who can lead decisively - in a positive direction.  I 
don't care how decisive you are if you're leading me off a cliff, I'm 
turning before we take that plunge.  Clinton's economy was far better 
than Reagans as far as I can see, Bush II's, however, frankly sucks; 
he's keeping a steady course all right, right into the shoals.

Flapping is a nice insult, but its a reflexive noun... an old game I 
play from time to time, lets try it here: I'm flexible, you're 
uncertain, he's a flip flopper.

Or lets look at Bush II: I'm decisive, you're stubborn, he's a hard 
headed ignorant ass.

Either is only a virtue when you like what the results are... and only a 
vice when the results are ones you disagree with.

Personally, I'd vote Flexible over Hard Headed... but I can see why you 
prefer Decisive to Flip Flop.  Both of us are being uncertain and 
stubborn about it though.

If Big Money wins, how the hell does Kerry get elected?  Unless big 
money is a code name for his wife?  It sure isn't a code name for the 
Oil industry, the Energy industry, the Military-industrial complex, the 
pharmecutical industry, the insurance industry, the... well, this could 
go on for a long time.

Maybe you mean people who are wealthy but have no income, so that they 
aren't benefiting from year after year of tax cuts targetted in their 
favor?  But thats not "Big Money", its "Old Money"... and I don't see 
how Kerry helps even that segment of the rich all that much, other than 
by a "rising tide lifts all the boats" sense.
