As I feel somewhat responsible for this line of thought, I'll jump in.

My rules to begin with were basically that you could only buy items off
NPC vendors that were part of their regular stock. No extravagant gifting
from friends, alts, etc. That was pretty much it. So, lockpicks, bandages,
cloth armor, food, spells, HQ ore, shuriken, etc. For what it's worth,
I don't consider Tribute buffs to be twinking.

I did a bunch of quests, I camped mobs that dropped gear I wanted, it was
a blast. It helped quite a bit that I had a steady duoing partner who was
always willing to put up with whatever annoyingly rare camp I needed. I
suspect it also helped somewhat that I'm a lizard monk, and level-appropriate
monk gear is actually pretty lame until the end game :) Gear I really
enjoyed picking up along the way: Forest Loop, Fist of Bone, Iksar Berserker
Club, the Ykesha haste item (my first *ever* non-purchased haste item in
EQ!), Polished Steel Ulaks, and lastly, the amazingly uber Goblin Foreman's
Tunic!

The one place where this philosophy didn't work for me was tradeskilling.
I love tradeskilling. I don't sell much, or make much money, but I just
like making stuff. I know, however, from past experience, that getting to
high (or even medium!) levels of skill takes *ages* unless your INT or WIS
is minimally 150+. I had no intention of waiting until I was a level 50+
monk to get level-appropriate gear that would give me so much wisdom before
I even considered tradeskilling. So fairly early on, I bought a WIS suit
in the bazaar, eventually getting up to ~175 WIS by my mid 40's, which
made tailoring (and other skills) improve in a time frame that was acceptable.
Many of my WIS suit items were significantly better than my "regular" gear:
I just didn't worry about how much AC/HP/status I lost when I was done
tradeskilling.

As I did more tradeskilling, I also relaxed somewhat my strict vendor
policy. I figured I'd killed enough spiders that it really wasn't that
unreasonable to buy spider/spiderling silk off vendors when I found them.
Same for various pelts. My exception here was that if I could hunt the
critters that dropped the items, it wasn't that unreasonable to buy them
either. It wasn't an issue for me as a monk, but I'd hate to have had to
farm all the zillions of spell pages myself if I was an INT caster. Bleagh!

Another hole in the concept of "level-appropriate gear" has to do with
tradeskilled gear. For gear made from critter drops (black panther armor)
it seemed reasonable that if you can kill the critter, the gear must be
reasonable. For stuff made from vendor parts, it's a much tougher call.
I don't know what level velium diamond rings and robes of abrogation
are appropriate for, but I think 1 isn't it.

Anyway, my lizard monk is now my highest character ever (46), and I hope
to someday pick him back up when I return to the EQ1 world.

Food for thought!
