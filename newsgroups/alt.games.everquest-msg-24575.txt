Illusions don't drop like invis does...you don't have to worry about it.
Illusions last a good long time (it's got to be at least a half hour but I'm
too lazy to look it up).  I do suggest you have a map ready when you hit
Oggok though.

Oh, and be invis as you zone in...since illusions, of course, don't stick
through a zone line and - although highly unlikely - there may be an ogre on
the other side.

But yeah, it doesn't hurt to be invis right up to the instance you meet
Clurg.  Being cautious in a zone where doing a CR may be difficult is a GOOD
thing. :)
