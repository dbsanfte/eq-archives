If someone merges in front of you, do you suggest:

A) Slowing up to let them get up to  speed.
B) Merging left if possible so you don't have to slow down but still 
don't hit them
C) Continuing at full speed, knowing you are right even if it means 
slamming into their rear end

It sounds to me like you are advocating C...

Personally, if I'm being tailgated, I slow down.  If they get closer, I 
slow more.  Only once have I actually come to full stop in the middle of 
the road following this practice, normally people either back off or go 
around, once it becomes clear whats happening.  Never has someone rear 
ended me as a result... but if they do, as long as I'm doing it on a 
road with no minimum speed, I'm pretty sure they are going to end up "at 
fault" for the incedent, as they are (illegally) following too close and 
I am (legally) driving slower than the posted maximum.

If I slammed on my breaks suddenly, I suspect the same would apply, but 
its possible that in some states this wouldn't be true.  I do think 
though that from a practical standpoint I'd be at fault, even though the 
tailgater would also be culpable, you should always drive at a distance 
sufficicient to avoid hitting the guy ahead of you if he ends up 
stopping dead (say his poorly reparied transmission seizes up, or he 
hits a hippo in the road)

It -is- the fault of the person who turned instead of yeilding. 
However, if you were the driver of the car proceeding legally thru the 
green light and slammed into that guy who turned illegally, its going to 
be cold comfort to you when you wake up in the hospital three months 
later to be told you missed the funeral of your spouse, who died in the 
seat next to you.

You were right.  Spouse is still dead, and you're still wracked up in 
that hospital bed, probably over the maximum payout from what insurance 
(if any, he's already doing one illegal thing) allows. Maybe you should 
have followed the law of the Jungle instead of the law of California, 
and covered your ass by watching for idiots doing something illegal.

Yep, the two are different things... but if I had to pick one, I'd go 
with common practice, very often such things are much safer than 
following a rigid set of codes and hoping for the best.
