I look at Harvest this way.  Every 10 minutes or so, you can give yourself
half a bubble of mana back IF it's safe for  you to be out of the action for
20 seconds - 10 seconds casting and 10 seconds stunned.  (Yes, you can duck
out of the first half.)  Or you can think of it as one free nuke every 10
minutes.

If your mana regen is keeping up with the Joneses, either nuke a little
harder (aggro permitting) or sit on it for emergencies.  There's some
security in knowing you can blow the whole manabar on an unexpected
situation and then 20 seconds later having at least a little to contribute.
