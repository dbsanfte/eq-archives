	Replies to random stuff above that I missed earlier:

|Swiftblade of Zek?

	Yes.

|Is that a good or high end bow? Friend with bow of storm(? from seru) does
|absolutely sick damage with his EQ/AM3

	Twisted is a 32+2/38 from Nightmare, drops in Poxbourne's maze.  It is one
of the best tradeable bows in the game (only the fletched elemental bows are
better, AFAIK, and the parts for those are too rare), and probably the best
bow most Rangers will ever see.

	Bow of Storms has a ratio over 1.0.

|And also, what zone?   my 220 dps in HoH is more like 80 on 3rd floor
|ssra... and 30dps versus xtc!

	1st tier planar mobs.  I've found yard trash in Storms once now but didn't
have the parser running at the time.  The Trueshot numbers are against red-con
raid targets; I don't Trueshot blues.  I've hit level 62 since but haven't had
a chance to parse, and don't expect any real improvement anyway.

|Im not a ranger so don't know all the bows and arrows... those arrows sound
|pretty good, the bow though.. well primal is nice and all, but its nowhere
|near endgame (rant coming up)

	Primal/prismatic is an endgame bow.  Most Rangers will probably never have
anything like it.  I rather imagine that in most guilds capable of getting
one, any Ranger who did would be passed over for a Luclin or PoP one because
the primal can't be handed down.

|A monk with the 2 best SoL weapons, V3 and AoBx2 + Avater parsed out below a
|ranger using the top (or second) best bow in Velious...

	The Ranger averaged lower than you. She spiked higher than your average,
but then, by definition, so did you.  Your /discs reset much, much faster than
ours as well; Trueshot is still less frequent than once per hour at 62.

	Muir says:

|Bow of Storms is ok as an upgrade to Bow of Doom or something but
|absolutely miles away from endgame gear itself

	EHHH???  What counts as "endgame", Plane of Time?  Longbow of the
Stormcaller has a *slightly* better ratio and no proc....

	Who gives a rat's ass, when a Dire Charmed pet does 50% more damage than
both of us put together?

	Only because you don't have to deal with the situational requirements.  (I
gave up trying to get people to stop stepping in front of me.  At least in
experience groups, I now use my Vial of Shrieker Essence to shrink anyone who
does.)
