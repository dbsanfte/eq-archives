I played DAoC too, and I don't agree that item wear was that bad.
Player crafted gear was easily of good enough quality to use every
day, and very easily replaced.  The reason the really good gear in
EQ is such a pain to get is that they try to limit the rate of 
introduction, since there is no way to take the item out of the
economy.  In an economy where things wear out, those artificial
constraints on introduction rate can be loosened, thereby making
nice items easier to get.
