Avoid Jewelcraft the only class that can realisticly do jewelcraft for
money is Enchanter.  to make stat jewelery you need enchanted metals,
only enchanters can enchant the metal.  Tailoring is a good skill to
start early as all items but patterns basically are dropped by mobs, and
you might as well hunt for exp as well as tailoring drops as long as
possible.
