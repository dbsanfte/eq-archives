I have made a bit of a killing on, what I am guessing to be a lag issue.
People are forgetting to get *all* the zeros on things.  For instance, I got
a Velium Blue Diamond Bracelet for 150pp, I am guessing they were trying for
1500pp.  It is a pain to list things when the lag is really bad, even facing
the wall (with clip down, and Luclin characters off).

Peace,
Xytrex
