Proved when doing JBoot turnins and Hasten isn't up. We'd always set
up at the 4-way and killing the PH till he pops. I've spawned him
probably half a dozen times that way. Never took more than 3 or 4
kills to spawn Hasten so I think he's pretty common.  I've never
actually spawned any of the other named that way but the info I got a
long time ago about spawning Hasten was correct so I'm assuming the
list of named mobs on the cycle was also correct.
