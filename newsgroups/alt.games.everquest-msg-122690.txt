I've spent all my time hunting and earning money / xp that I never really
devoted any time to this.  I initially thought I would do jewelry but I read
that requires a Enchanter to enchant the metal for you.  Is this a hassle?
What craft would you think best for an Eru Wiz of 36th level to start and
try to master?  Thanks!

Rom
