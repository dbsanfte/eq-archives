Well, school started recently.  Parents tend to motivate kids to study over
play early in the school year.

It's suddenly gotten a lot easier to sell a "top level most wanted class"
since character transfers are now a reality.  Want to make a quick $500?
Buy a 2nd account.  Get your 56 cleric transfered to that account.  Now sell
that account. Voila.   Supply & demand...the potential supply (especially
when considering that EVERY DAY there are more & more top level characters)
has HORRENDOUSLY increased therefore the prices are lower.

See the part of the quote you left intact...it's explained there.

Ditto.

People play for 2+ years.  They get high level.  They get bored.  They start
looking for reasons to quit that they can blame on others instead of the
simple fact that it's THEIR problem (eh, not necessarily a bad thing, so
"problem" is probably the wrong word) they're bored, not Verant's.
