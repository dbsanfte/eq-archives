For my SK - Holly Windstalker, several wandering barbarians, and Guard 
Nash are going to DIE.  Eventually.  REALLY eventually.  But trust me, 
they will die.  I'd prefer it if the game somehow let you lock them in a 
small box where you could neither stand nor sit nor lay back, and then 
threw away the key... but unfortunately, SOME people just don't have 
enough fun in their souls to think of such things.

For my mage - I've already started taking revenge - I got very bitter 
against orcs when fighting as a low-level in GFay.  The day I could solo 
a couple or more orc cents I took my pet to orc hill and started creaming 
them all, cackling in front of my computer (tried to make sure I wasn't 
hogging the spawns of course, and actually, was quite often alone up 
there at night - which would have made me wet myself a couple levels 
earlier).  I also made my family worry quite a bit.

My ranger hasn't made any enemies yet (well, except for some low-level 
mage that kept getting madmen on her butt and dragging them into the 
newbie zone of N. Ro, where I WAS RECOVERING THANKS - and how come guards 
don't attack them? I could SWEAR they attacked one the one time I had to 
drag one through), she just enjoys killing things that view her amiably, 
like wolves and coyotes.  Don't ask me why.
