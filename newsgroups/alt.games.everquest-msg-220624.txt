I use it all the time. Very very handy thing.  I'm bound by one of the
LDoN camps, so I put on /lfg, place a comment that I want and LDoN
group, then I go solo Storms or Mischief or shop in the bazaar or work
on tradeskills and eventually the tell will come.  No more having to
sit on your butt in one zone with a /ooc 65 Druid LFG hotkey going off
every few minutes.  The "tool" has made /lfg not so bad anymore...
now, to get groups to take a druid.. ;)
