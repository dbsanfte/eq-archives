I used to play UO. The game was so full of exploits and dupe tricks that
there were entire sites dedicated to finding the latest bug that gave
advantage to the player. Having played EQ for a few months now, it seems
like a hugely more stable environment (thankfully).
There was an old bug in UO; The server saved every 3 hours. You could put a
huge amount of gold in your bank for 3 hours (so it saved) and then give the
gold to a friend. By running to a server zone you could spam the command to
jump between the 2 realms on seperate servers until the boudary became
flooded and dumped your charachter out of the game. It would then recall a
previously saved version of the charachter with the gold still in the bank
and in your friends possesion.

There were also similar things where you could duplicate horses and increase
skills at astonishing rates.

What I want to know is if there are people that do this in EQ, just I havent
heard about them?
Are there duped items out there and how can I tell them apart?
