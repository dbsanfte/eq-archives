If there are any Ayonae Ro server users who use this board please contact me
in game. Toon name is Winamyen and I am in guild Soldiers of Valor at the
present time. Lots going on which I WILL NOT discuss with anyone outside the
guild but I want to know about other guilds and problems they may have.
