DOH!  I don't know why I do this.  I never make this mistake when I'm
seriously writing... only when dashing off a post or an email reply.

I blame in on the fact that I'm a programmer and we use double and single
quotes all over the place... and I usually reply from work, so I'm in
screwy-quote mode...

(That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it!!)
