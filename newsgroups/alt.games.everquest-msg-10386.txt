And I quote, from earlier in the thread:

"If you want a specific suggestion tell me what class, level, and
where
you're bound. I made 5k+ by level 15 or so but what I did may not work
for you.

Avenger."

Implying that you would share with him your incredible plat-making
wisdom.  Which, of course, you didn't.  Because you can never back up
your arguements.  Because, as usual, you're talking out your ass.

Tell ya what, rocketrider, why don't  you go ahead and apply for one
of those "EQ Guides" that srwagner was selling, maybe then you'd
actually sound like you know what the fuck your talking about when
you're trying to bullshit everyone here.
