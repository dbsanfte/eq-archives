I joined a group today trying to use AOEs.  We failed pretty miserably.  Our
group was a SK pulling, chanter, 2 clerics, 2 wizards.
Has anyone gotten this to work?  
Of course it doesn't help that the drop rate sucked.  The casters kept getting
agro and healing was a nightmare.  Chanter ended up dead twice, SK once, me
once before we gave up...
And we were doing a EC LDON ....
