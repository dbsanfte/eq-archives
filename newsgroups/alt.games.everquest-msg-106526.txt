  Well, for one, the offending text doesn't have to be visible... depending
on how you have your window and font sizes set, you can do a /report and
text that may not be visible on your screen may be sent to the server for
authentication anyway.  The reason they ask you to scroll up so the
offending text is within 10 lines from the bottom line, is so the server
only has to authenticate 10 lines, instead of doing a /report and having the
server authenticate every line of text you have in your chat buffer, which
could be hundreds of lines.

  There's no reason for that sort of data to be stored as any kind of
graphic.  You're reporting text, and text is much easier to store and search
than graphics are.
