I stipulate every one of your points

But Run 3 is better than JBoots in the way that a volvo is better than a corvette;
its a trifle slower but far more reliable; you'll never ever lose run 3 due to being
dispelled, never see it run out because you forgot to refresh it, it won't run out
indoors...

Similarly, SOW is like a Lamborgini compared to that pokey old 'Vette; its worlds
faster and more reliable... unless it breaks down, thats when you'll want your
Corvette.  Selos is like a Funny Car compared to either, far faster still... but boy
does it run out of gas fast!

Once you have run 3 the only use for JBoots is as a dispell preventer.
