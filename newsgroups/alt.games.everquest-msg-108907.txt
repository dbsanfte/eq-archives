But really what can be called evil? Emmanuel Kant describes evil as being
what one percieves. That if person_01 doesn't see something as evil or
doesn't think evil exists, then it doesn't exist. If person_02 thinks evil
exists, well for that person evil exists.

Then what it really boils down to is that the existence of evil is an
opinion. And everyone is entitled to their opinion, but does it make them
right? /ponder
