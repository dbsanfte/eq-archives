With MDK 8, you are most likely using IPTables, I would think.  I always do
an Expert install with High security.  If you did a more automated install,
it may have installed some other firewall software ( don't know, I've never
done it that way ).

As suggested, you will probably want to post your /etc/sysconfig/iptables
file.  Also, I had to modify my /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables script to make it
work.  It sounds to me like Gary is pretty proficient and would be able to
help you.  I can toss some comments out if you give us more info, but I bet
he can get you up and going.

I believe there are 2 ports you need to make available to your intranet, but
don't know them offhand ( 9000, 9001 ? ).

If you -do- post your /etc/sysconfig/iptables, then change your IP address
in the file to something like xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx so that the hacking morons
don't get your IP.  Then again, if you are posting from this same
connection, it's too late...
