J-boots are campable by a 44 mage (in OOT) as is Gornit
to put the cash together for T-boots.  So, yes, it takes
a while.  In the meantime, choose mobs that don't run
fast, and perfect the art of strafe running back to your
pet on the pull.

This was the source of 90% of my deaths soloing as a mage.
I was so against having to zone and resummon (particularly
if I had a good pet - thank heavens for summoning at max
level now :) I'd stick out really iffy fights.

I've channelled gate through losing 3 bubbles of health in
the 5 seconds it (used to) take.  (4.3 now :)
