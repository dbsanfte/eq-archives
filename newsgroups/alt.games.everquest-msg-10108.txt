Making money by supplying others with things they dont have is the basis for
all businesses today. Why any different here?
I used to make up to $1000 a month playing ultima online and it was a great
source of secondary income.

Perhaps Verant Could find other solutions to the problem, like restricting
the ability to hold more than one of any rare item?

If people didnt buy the items in the first place. who would want to sell
them. The buyers are just as much to blame.
