I wasn't extrapolating anything. I stated how many *are* being used to
run the worlds, that's all.

Entirely apart from that, I noted the kinds of things that an EQ
server must do which differ from the mail and news servers they keep
getting compared to.

Seven percent load on your 7000-user server? Sure, not a problem, as
long as those users are all humans who aren't each putting a
*continuous* load on the machine. It works for the same reason that a
shared pipeline works - most of those users are idle at any given
moment.

An EQ zone server calculates *constantly* for *every* moving object in
the hosted zones, and every action any object takes. There is no idle
time.
