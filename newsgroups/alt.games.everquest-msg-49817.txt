Hello there players.

I am a New Bee in this MMORPG universe

I am interested in starting to play either EverQuest or Ultima.
But before buying one of these games I would very much like if any of you
could tell me why I should choose EQ over UO.
Is it only a question of graphics what you prefer or is there a lot more to
it?    -  I have a hunch that there is more to :o)

Would any of you please line up some of the pro's and con's, just what you
think are the major differences and makes EQ better than UO.
(I asume you all like EQ better since this is an EQ newsgroup)

Thank you very much.
