Nope.

Got my copy, installed, and pulled a CRC error in Disk 3 (of 10).
Second time around, I copied the stuff to a second directory as it was
installing.  When it failed (and erased the install!) I copied my
"spare" back into the EQ2 directory, then double-clicked on EQ2.EXE.
Had to use my account code, do the whole set-up-payment rigamarole,
then it proceeded to download.  5 hours or so on Shaw Cable.
