Shrug.. is this uber to you?

Its pretty uptodate too (mith crown instead of square helm, and he's level
61-62, it varies..)

Each time Ive gone against the executioner and been the shaman as well as
monk, I've slowed him off the bat and ended up tanking it half the fight on
my shaman (as well as tanking every wave of mobs other than the current
target, thanks ae slow!)

If my slow wasnt actually having any effect, then a 4.2ish k char was
tanking an unslowed executioner for about 50% of his hp - and i *know* you
have a lot more hp/ac/tanking abilities than my shaman.

I've seen groups pass the trials from guilds who can't kill Vindi outside of
their allies.. thats what i based my trivial opinion on :/
