No reason to fear OEM video cards. They're not made for a specific system. 
They're made to be used by, but not tailored to, third tier PC builders in 
their systems (such as ABS - a quality online PC builder). I have heard of 
infrequent cases of OEM versions being mildly crippled for a more 
attractive price tag, but most generally all you are giving up is the 
retail packaging and bundled software/cables. There is also often a 
difference in the support options in that scenario, but I've never had to 
utilize it, so it's a non-factor for me.

The only thing I would concern myself with when checking out the prices on 
PriceWatch.com is the actual merchants themselves. Check their ratings.
