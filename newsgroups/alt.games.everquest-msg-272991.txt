I'm Paladin, level 60 + 12aa and growing.

I've found Root and Instill to be unreliable at best, particularly with mobs at level 50
and above.  My Alteration skill is at the cap of 235.

At 60, it's difficult enough to earn XP on my server - hard enough so that I don't want to
assume the risk of death in a now-unpopular zone where it would be very difficult to get a
Resurrection.
