    I read this whole paragraph wondering "Um, didn't she know about
duck?"  I have to admit, thought, that I found out about ducking on
accident.  As those of you who frequent serverwide.age:age know, I often
carry on multiple conversations, and only occasionally type the right
thing in the right place.  Many times it happened that I was fighting
and chattering at the same time, without actually being in chat mode. 
After several times of coming to word with a "d" in it, and having to
abruptly recast whatever I had in the works, I made the connection, all
by myself!
