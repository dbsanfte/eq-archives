If you don't want to reveal to her the identity of your alt, and don't want
to appear to just 'randomly' boot her from the guild for no reason, then
here's a possibility....

Tell her that a friend of yours from outside the guild has questioned her
reputation (if you roleplay, you could say your alt was your main's friend).
Let her know you must test her to prove her character, as your guild's
reputation is very important.

Create some sort of in-guild quest (or series of tests) for her to complete.
Make it something that would be a test of her loyalty to the guild and it's
values.  Maybe part of the testings might risk a bad faction hit that would
bother her (if she proves worthy, make it something that your guild could
help her repair later on).

If you're a good or generous guild, as part of the quest, you could have her
find some newbie who's working hard and not begging, and have her give her
most valuable item to him.  See which she values more... possessions, or
reputation.

If you wanted to be nice to her about it, the newbie could be a mule played
by a fellow guildie without her knowledge.  Upon successful completion of
her tests/quests, *surprise!* she gets her item back.

The idea behind this is to prove if she's worthy to wear your guild's name
tag....if she is unworthy, she will most likely give up and  /guildremove
herself.
