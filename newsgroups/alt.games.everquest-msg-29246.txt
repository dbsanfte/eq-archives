So? Did you attack anything while you had the pet? Now *that* would have been
interesting and a good test of the bug you experienced.  If it joined in and
attacked on your behalf, you could have just attempted to stay logged on for
days. Go sit in the middle of an area with some dangerous roamers and go afk for
a nice sandwich and a cold beer. Come back after the wurm has gotten you a few
levels of xp.
(Yes, I know, "exploit". But it would sure look funny.)
