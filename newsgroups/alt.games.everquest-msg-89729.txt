Going through the tunnels from Shadeweaver's Thicket to Paludal Caverns,
shorlty before the Paludal zone there is a spot where the tunnel widens
out a bit. At this point there is a torch stuck in the ground on each
side. Clicking on those torches makes them twist about 90 degrees and
there is a door-opening sound. Clicking them again does same except
they twist back to the original position.

If there really is something opening, I couldn't find it.
