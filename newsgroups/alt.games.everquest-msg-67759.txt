I wouldn't have minded so much if he had just posted his stupid petition
link here, but he also culled email addresses from the newsgroup, and
emailed the same post, that I do mind.

As for the rest of your post, I agree, Sony did foist upon us something that
obviously needed a lot more testing, and fixing.  If I tried to get
something that worked as poorly as that shipped out the door, I'd probably
get fired.  I am not happy about it, although, overall, it works fairly well
for me.  I have friends that are now unable to play despite meeting and/or
exceeding the recommended requirements.
