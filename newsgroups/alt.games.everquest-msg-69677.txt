I had problems like that in EQ and DAOC while using DirectX 8.1. When I ran
them with the latest Nvidia drivers (I use a GeForce 3 Ti-500/P4-1.7/512k)
and DX 8.0a I had no problems. So I removed DX altogether (there is a nice
DX remover utility since 8.1 cannot be removed manually unless you really
want to mess with your system registry etc) and reinstalled 8.0a. Daoc works
fine again and I "got rid of" my EQ account so I don't care about DX8.1...
All I can suggest since you need DX8.1 is to download the latest drivers
from www.nvidea.com and see what happends. Personally I think DX8.1 is
screwed up. It slows down my gaming FPS compared to 8.0a. Or the dev team
just didn't fully test 8.1 with GF3's. Others have had the same problem. Now
I find this odd because the X-Box uses the Nvidia chipset for it's video
display...go figure! And before someone jumps on me, don't tell me about how
the X-Box does not use DirectX..we all know that it has no O/S obviously
(ala ROM based).
