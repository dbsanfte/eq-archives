Donaldson is a very "adult" writer.  Most of his character aren't very
nice people.  I just finished the gap cycle.  I keep meaning to read the
mirror series.  But the people he writes about aren't nice,  But they
are very much real, and well rounded.  You can understand their motives
and reasons.

BTW Angus Thermopyle makes Thomas Covenant look like a saint.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
