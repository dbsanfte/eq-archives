We have been discussing that at length, so far, the consensus seems to be
that people don't want to rock the boat, depsite the general feeling that
the current system is totally unfair.  I don't have an issue with the
rotation per se, just with the fact that it excludes an alliance of guilds
from participating.  It is not so much an issue for The Appointed as such,
as we provide 80 to 90% of the people on any given raid, and could probably
take down either one on our own.  I am going to continue to push for us to
work out a way to go after them, preferably without causing problems with a
lot of other guilds.
