Hello,

Interesting. I have been playing LDoN since release.  I have had the
following experience with getting groups:

1)Logged in and within 30 secs was invited into a full group ready
togo (Luck I guess)

2)Sat around OOCing and got into a group within 20 - 30 min

3)Actually used the /lfg toolbox and put together a group in 20 - 60
min

4)Just SAT there with lfg on and did nothing.  Tells start comming in
anywhere from 5 - 30min asking if I want a group in this or that zone

5)Sat in Everfrost for about 2-3 hours with no groups/players  for
LDON in that zone.  Did get a few tells from other zones, but didn't
want to do MMC or Tak.

Now the above results are from the Stormhammer server.  The server
population there is quite low compaired to other servers.

Also, I have noticed that some people don't want to work at forming
groups.  They are lazy F*CKS who just want to leech off other people's
time and work ... sortta like real life huh?  I don't beg people.  I
just /tell <name> Want a Everfrost group?  I do it only once.  If a
person is motivated to play, within 15 secs I get a reply, 'SURE
OMW!!!'.  After 15 secs I send a tell to another LFG person.  Here are
some useful tips on getting groups:

1)Use the /lfg toolbox
2)Put yourself on lfg even if you are in a group.  This is so others
who are looking for people with send you a tell.  The more hooks you
have in the water, the better your chances of catching a fish!
3)use /who all cleric,sham,war,... 65 to find out if people are in the
PoK, BoT, ect. and wish to join a LDON group but have NOT placed
themselves on the lfg roster.  I used 65 as just a lvl example.  Alot
of people 60+ may be in PoJ or PoV only because they could not find a
LDON group.  Once you alert them that a group is available they will
dump the PoV and come down to your LDON group.

Ok these should get you going.
