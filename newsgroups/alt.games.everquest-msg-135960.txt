Thanks for the explanation. It's too bad it causes such slowdown. With all 
of the improvements in video cards over the years it just surprises me 
that this is something that has persisted. My cards are as follows: 
Riva128 ZX (8) > TNT2 Ultra (32) > GeForce2 Ultra (64) > GeForce4 Ti4600 
(128).

My system right now is:
Asus A7V333
AMD AthlonXP 1900+ (1.6GHz)
512MB PC2100
SB Live! Platinum 5.1 (sent for RMA currently)
GeForce4 Ti4600 128MB

How's the performance gain on the DDR333 (PC2700) RAM? Does it matter what 
brand? Looking on PriceWatch it looks like I could get a 512MB stick of 
that for about $120. My system can go up to 3GB, but only with three 1GB 
chips. Where can I buy 1GB memory chips?
