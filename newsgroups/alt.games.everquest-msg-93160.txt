Even if that is true, though another poster says it is not, it would
only mean that druids melee really incredibly and completely totally
sucks ass while your melee would suck ass a little bit more. When a
druid's melee totally and completely sucks ass, as does a shaman's,
does it really matter that your's might be slightly worse?

I play a 55 druid. When I'm hitting something with a weapon I am
either doing it because it is an orc pawn or because I feel like being
particularly foolish that day. The only other reason I might be
hitting something is because I'm FM and bored and think its funny to
see If I can hit vindi for 2 points of damage.
