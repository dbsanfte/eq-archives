Read the patch...  It says you can port from Norrath.

Thing is... It will NEVER negate the need for scions.  Why?  Porters will
never always be available all the time, and while it lessens the need for
waiting, it does not, however, make scions obsolete.  Example:
FV/Overthere.  Obviously, the more easier way to get there is by Boat than
to get a port and try running a bunch of zones to get to certain places in
Kunark.  Just as taking a Scion from Gfay to get to NK...  In the time I
yell for a port with one of my non-porting characters, I could have ridden
the scion up and down before I get a port.
