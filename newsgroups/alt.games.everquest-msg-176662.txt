Um, well, you might try the humble thing once in a while :P

Here's a slightly better solution that gives you 5 tries:

/pause n, /doability X
/pause n, /doability x
/pause n, /doability x
/pause n, /doability x
/doability x


Note that only the /pause command can be put on the same line with
another command, AND the pause happens *after* the command that
follows it, despite the opposite syntactic ordering.  So there are
only two forms of commands that work in macros:

/xxxx

or

/pause n, /xxxx
