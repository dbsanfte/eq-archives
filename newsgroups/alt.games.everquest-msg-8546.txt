Of course, I know that one should definitely not cast a DD spell on a
mezzed mob as that will break mez.  However, I think I recall reading
how some people cast DoT spells on a mezzed mob.  The only DoT spell
my shaman currently has (Sicken) does do a small amount of damage when
casted (I think between 4-8 points).  Is that going to be enough to
break mez?  Are there other types of DoTs, such as a necro's DoTs,
that won't break mez?  

I probably will play it safe if I am grouped with an enchanter and
just not cast ANY spells on a mezzed mob, unless I know there are some
spells that can be safely cast on them without breaking mez.  What
spells, if any, are there that would fit in that category?

Thanks in advance.
