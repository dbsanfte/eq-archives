Afflack? (sp?)

With all the references to going crazy, epic, and even the drug reference,
surprised no one has brought up another common one (had some funny
commercials...though never understood if there was some sick meaning to the

they're laying there after doing the deed, the duck is laying between
them...hmm...what did they do to that duck!?).
