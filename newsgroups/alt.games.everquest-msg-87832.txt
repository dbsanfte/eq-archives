ok, thanks.

But are there any guilds on E Marr based in the UK that will accept
characters under level 40 who know what they are doing and dont beg?

The 'bleh' was because i cant get into the guild, not being high enough
level on this server. It wasnt because of their policies. I  have characters
in  their 50's on other servers that went through probation, that i dont
have a problem with.
As you rightly said, it protects the guild from 'newbie' level 60 characters
and those that dont enter into the spirit of being a member of a guild.
