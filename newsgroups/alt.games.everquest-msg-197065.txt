I recently started a froggie cleric alt and was amazed I didn't lose
everything upon dieing. The lvl 10 keep-your-gear rule is only in effect for
a couple of months now AFAIK.

I still don't like it. It's supposed to make it friendlier for newbies, but
all it does is teaching them that dieing is just a fast way of getting your
hp back up and an easy gate to bind point. It also means that most newbies
totally neglect the value of sense heading, knowing where you are going and
simple things like con things from a distance and whatch where you're going.
