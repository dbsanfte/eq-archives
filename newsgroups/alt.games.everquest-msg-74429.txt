  I'm afraid the point went over YOUR head, sir.  The point being made
was this: It's more difficult to read and understand messages that
don't have something that approaches proper spelling and grammar.  A
person's nickname (spelled or misspelled) has no bearing on how easy
or difficult is to understand someone's point if the rest of their
message is legible (as just about every message posted by "Tyger" is).

  Now do you have a comment that's relevant to THIS point, or were you
just looking for an opportunity to flame?
