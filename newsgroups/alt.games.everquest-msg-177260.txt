Its not the size of the world that makes running across the world hard, but
the stupid zone connections. So many of them were boats which involved
waiting up to 30 mins. Then they had scions which were still waiting but not
as bad. Velious was another awful place to get around. Supposedly one
continent, but for some reason I have to work my way through a giant fort to
get from one outside area to another? Then the same to cross from WL to CS,
and then again from CS to WW. Its not the time to run, its all the other BS.
