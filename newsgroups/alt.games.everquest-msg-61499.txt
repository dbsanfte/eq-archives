Win98 has no probs addressing upto 512mb with it's default settings (over
that and you will likely get errors but this can be solved fairly easily)
and I certainly haven't noticed any loss in performance, although I haven't
seen any improvement over 256 (noticed a lot of diff from 128 - 256)

Only  reason I still have a win98 partition is for games...I find poor
support on XP and 2000, they maybe minor annoyances, like mouse accel in XP,
it always appears to be on but they are there and I don't want to suffer
them.
