If you don't finish zoning by about 4x your usual zoning time (if it takes
you 30 seconds to zone normally, give it 120 seconds) that means the game is
locked up.  If you have Win2k/XP you can hit Alt-Ctrl-Del and cancel EQ...if
you're using something else, I've almost always found it necessary to hit
the Reset button on my computer.

The problem you're having is that Verant can't freaking write zoning
code...I've been having trouble getting into most Velious zones (if I can
zone 10 times in a row...well, I can't finish that sentence, I've never
zoned more than 6 times in a row), and certainly Shadowhaven.  I think
that's the only zone in THIS expansion that regularly trashes me.
