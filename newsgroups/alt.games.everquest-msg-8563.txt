yes,

i know this now. if it happens again i will let the guy have the camp (but
think he's a bit of a tosser, but wont tell him)
I wont offer to share but if they ask to share i will either share it with
them or let them have it (if it's not worth sharing).

remember i did let the guy have the camp the 2nd time because i wasn't "up"
on my camping etiquette.
i came here to get advice. i got the advice i needed.
i will know how to handle the situation the next time it happens, as i'm
sure it will.
