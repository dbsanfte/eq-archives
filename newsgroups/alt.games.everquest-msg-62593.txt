Make sure you use the 21.83 drivers from Nvidias sites, I installed the beta
ones 22.81? and had troubles. with 21.83 the majority of problems went away.
I use a Gforece 2 GTS 32mb DDR. Only glitcches I have now are the awful
clipping distance with fragementation on drawing the landscape at clipping
line, flames in torches etc are shown as three flat bitplanes with the flame
graphics on them and a bizarre fault making mobs appear above the ground
until you get closer to tehm
