Thus it is supposed to be said if 2+ people are hitting on it, and it
changes targets through taunt.  Thus by hitting it, you are actually
interfering with its plan to kill someone else.

Of course if you are the only one hitting it, it makes no sense.   ;-)
Or... maybe it WAS sleeping and by hitting it, you interfered with its nap.

Another thing, when they say "Jakugg, you have ruined your own lands, you'll
not ruin mine"   JUST HOW did you ruin your own lands.   ;-)   Since it is
totally impossible to modify the environment.... it doesn't make sense.
