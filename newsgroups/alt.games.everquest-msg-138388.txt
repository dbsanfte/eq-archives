I guess it sounds like what you're saying is that 'no, not having needs 
met is not a valid excuse for antisocial acts, so we should transfer the 
responsibilty for providing for those needs to society as a whole'?

Hmmm... this sounds suspiciously lke one of those good, well-intentioned 
ideas that's likely to get one lynched for being a pinko liberal PC commie 
socialist... Oh yeah, and unamerican.

Doesn't make it wrong, of course.  But it does look like that'd require a 
major restructuring of American society to implement.  Or am I 
misunderstanding The Vision (tm)?
