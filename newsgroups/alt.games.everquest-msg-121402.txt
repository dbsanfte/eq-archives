Provided there arnt 30 other people there with the same idea. Usually theres
only 1 or 2 giants on track, and they are in the process of being killed.
There are some good spawns to camp around the place (somewhere!) that drop
vendor items where you can make similar money to RM. A lot of these need
tracking tho.
