That's easy.  The developers.

No, seriously.

The people who are creating the game tend to have some sort of an idea
what they want to accomplish.  Very few things make it through the
design phase without having a purpose behind them.  In the end, you make
the product and hope that enough people think your vision of what the
game should be is compelling and worth playing and paying for.  But the
vision is still the developers, not the players.

That's not to say you don't listen to the players feedback.  After all,
you want players to enjoy the game.  But you have to filter it through
the lens of your vision for the game, and make the decisions about what
features are worth implementing, and which are not.  The moment you stop
filtering decisions through that lens, you lose control over your
destiny and end up with a shambles.

As Bill Cosby once remarked, "I don't know the key to success, but the
key to failure is to try and please everybody."  The developers are
there because they have something they want to produce, and it's their
ideas and vision that ultimate will prove its success or failure.  All
of us are just along for the ride.
