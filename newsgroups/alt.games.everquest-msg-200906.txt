These also tend to be the same people you see at 5 pct health within seconds
of dying and have 4 mobs beating on them, but as soon as you come to their
aid and kill 3 of the 4 adds you will be told to stop Killstealing.

Reminds me of a time my beastlord was hunting batwings in G.Fay, I was
around 45 at the time and I saw a level 2 ranger being smacked about by 2
orcs, so I ran up and knocked one on the head, in the end I had to put the
guy on ignore you can only put up with the same guy threating to petition
you for Killstealing for so long before it gets boring, I mean he could have
gone up 2 or 3 levels rather than sitting around and annoying me.

You just cant help some people.
