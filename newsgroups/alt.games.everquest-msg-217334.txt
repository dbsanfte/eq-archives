    It speaks to how easy it is to get folks to the elementals, sadly for
the game. However, that isn't meant as a knock against you. Being a  raid
guild leader at any level is tough - cudos to you for pulling it off. A few
questions, since I looked up a few things about your guild:

(1) Did you do most of your AA's solo/two-boxing, or was the focus on
tanking AA's because of the role you've taken as guild leader? At first I
thought it was a "puller over DPS" profile, but the double riposte and
return kick over critical mend just have me baffled if that's the case.
(2) I see a fair number of Rings of the Shissar in guild profiles, but no VT
loot. Giving VT a pass, or just a project put on hold while other things
were done (or did I just miss it)?
(3) I see a ton of ornate armour on members. Is this stuff that's been
farmed and/or obtained doing XP, or is most of it Bazaar-purchased? For a
raid guild your membership has a very, very high percentage of droppable or
once-droppable (like Ornate) gear, and I'm wondering if this is what modern
up-and-coming raid guilds will look like or if it was done as part of
gearing up the guild.
(4) What level of competition is there on RN in the elementals? How hard is
it for you to find mobs up? What's it like in tier II and III?
(5) I noticed you've killed Arch Mage Al at least once in Air (he's great
RvR). Other than Air mini-minis and XP nameds, what other targets have you
been able to hit up in your three weeks in Elemental planes? Have your
members been able to XP in Fire/Earth, or would you even know with LDoN
sucking everyone in?

    www.lotuscult.org for those that don't know. ;-)

    I like the background colour on the front page, and your editorial style
is refreshing. Any plans for a standard "guild roster" section with attached
Magelo profiles? And are the avatars on the boards really supposed to be
that big, or is that some adjustable thing that I just missed?
