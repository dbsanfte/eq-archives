All day today I've had a very strange lag.  My connection meter shows 0 0.0%
0.0% 1000, but I still am lagging.  If I click on a clickable piece of
equipment the spell doesn't start for 3 seconds and if I cast a regular
spell I can't sit down for 3 seconds after the spell finishes.  When I
looted my corpse, every item took from 3-5 seconds to loot.  I tried
rebooting my computer, modem, and dsl signal amplifier (whatever thats
called) and no help.  Is anyone else having this problem or have been
through this before and know what to do about it?
