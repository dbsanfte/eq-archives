   No, I'm the one that thought it odd that I was still maintaining it, and
thought/thinks that an active player would be inherently better at it.  And
the volunteer... um.. *lowers voice to a stage whisper* we've been
communicating.

  AGE FAQ, my new version.

Question 1  What is Everquest?

Answer:  A game I no longer play.

The End.

   You mean sorta like that?

    But they *give* so much more in return!

   So you get the thrill of a roller coaster and offroading in one big boxy
package.  Perfection.

   If you don't waste gas, the terrorists win.  *Cue patriotic music*

   This is silly.  Drive the 'bego everywhere!  Need to go the 7'll for
bubblegum?  'Bego time!  Want grab a burger at a drive thru?  'Bego time! 
And maybe you can tear the roofs off a few Burger Kings.

   You don't need an RV for that.  But it wouldn't hurt any.

   You'd be just a camera crew away from having the next Big Hit on Fox.  I
know I'd watch.

   Easily solved.  CIHYS?

   I'm pretty sure RV's have roof.  Do your sword banging thing up there. 
Sure, things might be a little cramped compared to what you are used to,
but you'd get a nice view, and plenty of fresh air.

   No no no.  Don't park at all those four months.  Drive around seeing the
grandeur that is America/Canada/Mexico/South America.  Then, when you do go
the fairs, you feel like you've come home, instead of the other way around.

    A true friend would be able to find something else to mock them about. 
That's what friendship is all about.

   Now you begin to get it!
