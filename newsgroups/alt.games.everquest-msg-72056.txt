Sure...my level 60 and my level 49 rogue can regularly
clear Crushbone with no trouble solo.
;-)

Actually, rogues CAN solo...they just have a hard time
soloing efficiently for exp.  With decent gear (not including
a fungi tunic or Velious chest) a rogue can usually kill
even high blues without dying...the trouble comes from
bandaging up to half and sitting on your butt for 8 minutes
to get all your hps back.

With a Fungi or even a Velious chestpiece (or Myrlo BP
post 45) soloing can become more viable.  You'll never
quad-kite or take on evens and yellows, but once you
kill a critter, you can self-heal back up to full and start
again.

Again, nowhere near as efficient as grouping, but not
too long ago my alt rogue was grouping with her guild
and the level 55 rogue was tanking over the 52 SK. Why?
With his Myrlo BP (and higher level relative to the mobs)
he could self heal, and we didn't have any healing for almost
3 hours besides his Invigor (self only), the SK's Lifetaps,
and me getting the hell out of the way if something aggro'd.
