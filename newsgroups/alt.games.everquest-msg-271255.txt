I'd want to go back to the old spell sets, level limits, etc.  And the
old people.  I know it sounds strange, but people started to change
after Velious.  In a bad way, I mean.  SOE started selling expansions
not just as expansions, but also selling things like "easy travel"
expansions.  I think the whole game itself would need to be rolled
back, not just the geography/zones, in order to get those old style
people back, and thus, the whole old style feel.
