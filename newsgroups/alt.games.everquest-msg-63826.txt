60k plat? not quite.  If your main is lvl 20 and you have 60k you have
either hacked someones acct or spent 3 months straight combining fish
patties to sell back to vendors.

I have seen some of the plat guids. imho, they are a joke. they
usually consist of spending 10pp or so to get your baking skill over
100 and making a crap load of fish and selling it back for a few gold
profit... so you end up making about 90pp per hour, but my god your
fingers & eyes will be sore to no end from baking for hours on end.
from what i understand, they (verant) nerf this stuff when they see
too many ppl doing it.  they nerfed the fish cakes one about 6 months
ago.  ive seen guides recommending getting a bard to lvl 5 (speed
song) and go hang out at rathe mtns and loot the fine steel weps that
ppl usually leave or drop (they go for ~5pp each).  I tried a lot of
this stuff when i was a noob.  I'm a 54 cleric now and my advice to
getting good pp & loot is this:

1.  Screw the scams, just level. When you get into the high 30s-40s
you'll see the first taste off *decent* loot in SolB & LGuk that sells
from 100pp-1k which is usually all rolled on... if anyone claims NBG
(need before greed) this low, somethings wrong, find another group...

2.  Be an EC farmer =)  I met someone and since they told me their
story, I do it too on my 2nd puter while im playing my cleric on my
main puter.  EC farming is sitting in the trading tunnel in EC.  Find
a good deal, someone desperate and selling something much cheaper than
normal (fairly common, i do it a lot when i want to get rid of crap
fast like selling ssoys for 500 or blue diamnds for 500).  Then turn
around and sell them for market value.  The guy I mentioned before got
Velium Round Shield for 50pp then sold it for 200pp, bought a pair of
cougar earrings for 200, sold them for 350, etc... Sounds petty, but
when you get higher lvl you can make 5k profit easy.  I recently
bought a PSC for 25k and sold it for 32k the next day.

3. Start a druid and get him to 29 real quick (2 weeks time if you
know where to hunt, without PL'n of course).  Screw the 10pp ports. 
Run to Iceclad, GD or OT.  Or if you're willing to take a risk, sit
outside the seb orb in traks tooth (you will get smoked at 29 if you
get caught by an npc, but sow and careful navigation will avoid most
probs).  I see people paying 50pp-100pp all the time for a port out to
WC.  Hell, I pay 100pp all the time to get outta seb.

4. Cleric & Chanters, in the long run, make a lot of money... much
more than porters in high lvl game.  A cleric in seb will spend at
most 1k in dots for symbols in maybe a 10 hour block.  In return, the
cleric gets all the cash gems to comepensate.  After selling them, I
walk out with about 3-5k profit a night... not counting the items &
rare drops I win on rolls.  Some clerics make a killing on rez'es
after they hit lvl 49.  Lots of ppl will pay 100pp for a rez. I
personally rez free unless they are druids which I religiously charge
a min of 100pp, but that is just roleplaying (i'm a dark elf cleric
;^) ) and I know they have cash from porting.  Chanters make googoo
cash thru jewel crafting.  High level ppl pay 20k+ easy for a full set
of BD resist gear... It takes my wifes chanter 8k maybe to make it
all.  The catch to that is you gotta have high jc skill... took my
wife about 15k to become a 250 jc'er.

5. If you don't have the time, buy your pp for real cash.  While I
don't agree with this, you can go to playerauctions.com or ebay and
buy 10kpp for $100 USD.  Great if you have extra cash and just want
quick twink gear.  Myself, I value the stuff I earn much more than
stuff just given to me... but everyone is different.
