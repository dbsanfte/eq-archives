Gotta pay for the free handouts for the people who produce nothing
over there. I am consistantly amazed by the nations of the EU and
thier support for people who won't/can't/dunwanna work. At least in
the US we make them live under bridges. (Yes, thats sarcasm in there,
a little anyway)

It is shocking the scope of support in the Netherlands for people who
won't work, and the burden (Europe wide) on the taxpayers. In the US,
we would be going nuts, there would be a massive voter backlash, and
the appropriate knee jerk reaction.

Europe needs a Rush Limbaugh. I listen to my European friends, who are
thoughtful people, and a number of them get fed up with the European
system of Tax and Spend. The problem is instead of changing it, many
move to the US. I guess that concentrates the leftists who stay in
Europe, and makes the taxes higher for those who stay there and
produce.

I hear Brigitte Bardot has been moving right, she was quite the hottie
in her prime.
