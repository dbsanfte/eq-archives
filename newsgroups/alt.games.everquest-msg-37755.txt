This is specifically about what (I think) a Bard song did to my Ranger, but
it may apply to AoE spells as well!

I had just finished a fear-kiting session in Iceclad, and was about to camp
on the dock. A player runs by yelling, that he had lag and couldn't deal
with a cougar. I selected the cougar and started attacking it, following
them both around the dock. All is well.

I cast fear on the cougar when I reached the snow-end of the dock again,
fear takes, player starts hitting cougar again, I stand next to Masurk (sp?)
watching, waiting to re-cast fear if necessary. All is still well.

A Bard decides to help as well. At this point the cougar is where the dock
meets the snow, the player is just up the hill, the bard is further up the
hill, I am just on the dock next to the Gnome. Nobody is grouped, I have the
cougar selected but I am out of melee range. The Bard plays, I think, an AoE
song. The next thing I know the Gnome has agroed on me and I am dead.

The Bard camped very quickly, the player I was helping finished his kill and
survives, is thankful, and sorry that I died. He wonders why I attacked the
gnome (!). We piece together what happened and come to the conclusion that
it must have been the Bard's fault.

Can anyone make sense of this? Is this a peculiar effect of Bard songs? If a
caster had used an AoE spell, would the same happened? Does this mean a Bard
can get me killed by playing an AoE song on my target as I pass a guard?

My guess on this was that the only things in the agro range of the Gnome
were the Cougar (target of the AoE) and me (auto-attacking and casting on
the cougar), the Gnome "assumed" I had caused the AoE.

I was very confused by this, let alone angry because I lost a whole yellow
bubble of 36 and it took me to within two blues of un-dinging!
