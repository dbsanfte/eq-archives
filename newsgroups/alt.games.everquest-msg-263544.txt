Someone in this thread repeated the media spin that says Kerry thinks 
terrorism is a nuisance.

Kerry didn't say terrorism IS a nuisance. He said he'd like to reduce it 
to a nuisance, where it used to be.

Terrorism is a tool, like a gun or an embargo; it can be used by all 
sorts of people to attempt all sorts of results. You can't stop 
terrorism cold, no matter how much you might like to, any more than you 
can stop speeding or drug abuse or murder.

The best you can do is to respond aggressively and decisively to 
terrorism in a way designed to discourage its use.

Spain was wrong in allowing terrorist attacks to affect the change they 
wanted. Israel has been wrong when its tried to accomodate Hamas. The 
many americans who support the IRA have been wrong.

Going after Osama was right. Backing off from the hunt was wrong. 
Attacking terrorist training camps back in the Clinton administration 
was right, stopping after getting the press off your back about 
Monicagate was wrong.

Attacking Sadaam is -not- an appropriate response to terrorism: it may 
have been a good thing to do, but it had nothing to do with the specific 
attacks or group we were supposedly going after, and it distracted us 
from the job we were supposed to be doing.

Telling americans to go back to living their lives, to shopping, was right.

Passing the Patriot Act restricting the freedoms of Americans, and 
constantly ramping up the Alert Level, is wrong: the particular 
terrorists we are fighting loath freedom and -want- us scared: now they 
don't have to actually do anything to terrorize us, just drop a few 
hints and Ridge will do the terror part for them.

I'd love to see a day when terror has been defeated, not as if there 
were some nation of terrorism that might surrender, but when terror was 
discarded as a useless tool that never achieves its aims.

I think, on the whole, that this is impossible, that Kerry is right, the 
best you can do is reduce it to nuisance levels... but I also think even 
this is extremely difficult, and that it requires getting the whole 
world to think in these terms; as long as terror can be used 
successfully as a tool to achieve ends, new terrorists will be born 
wherever there's a cause and desperate men willing to stoop to that level.
