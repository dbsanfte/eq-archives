<snip common problem report>

Sorry if I can't be more helpful, but working with a lot of folks for whom I
do computer support, I invariably see a lot of problems when people try to
play state of the art games with state of the art video cards after having
"upgraded" their OS on top of an old OS. The nature of the problems are
often such that even installs of new drivers won't help if remnants of old
components remain available in system directories that are accessed as a
result of outdated registry entries, and so on. The difference between this
scenario and the one in which a user saves his important data, reformats,
installs a fresh OS, updates everything through Windows Update, and then
reinstalls apps fresh, is so dramatic, I don't even think about it anymore,
I just do it. It invariably saves net time. Perhaps not in every case, but
in enough cases to make it *clearly* the optimum way to proceed in the
general case.

This may not be an acceptable solution for you and I wouldn't blame you if
you railed against Microsoft or whoever for the inconvenience this will
cause, but that's my observation having dealt with hundreds (maybe
thousands) of computer installations professionally and on my own home
network of PCs and servers.

Good luck, hope you get it sorted.
