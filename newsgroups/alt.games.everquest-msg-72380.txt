I know I probably won't be meleeing that much later on in my druid's life,
but I was wondering (anyway) which weapon she was inately better with, if
either. She has a FS Scimitar she hasn't been using since it isn't magic and
she can't hit wisps with it, but her 1HB is maxed at the moment, I guess
from killing the kodiaks. IS she better with one vs the other or is it a
matter of keeping both skills maxed?
