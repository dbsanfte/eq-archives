when I press the up-arrow key which is run forward for me, I can press
the left arrow key and turn as I run.  But I can't press the right
arrow key to turn rigth as I run.  When I stop the right and left
arrow keys turn me right and left, respectively.  It's only been this
way for the past few days.  Maybe since the patch?  I've tried
reloading the defaults and installed the latest video drivers but it's
still there.  Any ideas?

thanks,

Robert
