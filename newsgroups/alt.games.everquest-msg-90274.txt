Me, I'm wondering if this might be a relatively good / cheap way to
get all of ones characters together and put them all on one server. 
In my case, I've got a mage and fighter on one server, an enchanter on
another, a rogue on another, et al, et al.  I'd like to consolodate
down to one non-PVP server, and was thinking this might be the way to
go.  Ideas?
