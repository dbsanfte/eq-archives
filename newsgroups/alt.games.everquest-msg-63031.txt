1.  Everquest never has changed *ANY* system setting or DLL, at all, ever.
    I don't know why they'd start now.

2.  Everything EQ needs is self-contained in the Everquest directory,
    and doesn't get run, at all, until you actually kick off Everquest.
    It can't possibly affect anything that occurs between the last cold
    boot of the system, and the first time you subsequently run EQ.

3.  The computer I'm on right now has the very latest EQ patches
    installed, including the ones from the Test server, and I just
    tried a dialup connection 10 seconds ago (I normally use a cable
    modem ISP), and it connected at 53,333, same as always.

Try a cold boot, followed by a modem dialup without running
Everquest.  If it still connects at a slow speed, it ain't
Everquest.  I'll only be impressed if you see a drop in modem
connection speeds after running EQ, up until the next cold boot.

If the problem started after upgrading those computers to DX8, blame
Microsoft.
