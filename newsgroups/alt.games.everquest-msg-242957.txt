Well, kind of.  I have earned 4000 points in Mistmore.  I can see everything
there that is for sale and buy it if I want.  I don't want any of it.
I have earned 250 points in Miragul.  I canNOT buy a 3000 point item in
Miragul.  I can only buy items that are worth 250 points or less.  I can buy 4
of those items if I choose, but no item costing 251 points or more.
