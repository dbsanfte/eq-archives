First it goes through a database of names that are banned and goes
through filter looking for offensive word or censor bypass.  After
that it comes down to 2 possible ways:  

If a GM is online somewhere and is in lousy mood, they can reject the
names.  However they can't do anything else until a name gets accepted
and most GM usually ignores the name checks anyway by approving them.

If no GM is online and the name passes the filter check and is not
used on the server, it usually goes through.  There's been a few times
when that didn't work.  I had a case where I couldn't use the name
Soandso while using DE SK but got accepted when using a kitty shammy.
Caulk it to SOE's idiosyncrasies.
