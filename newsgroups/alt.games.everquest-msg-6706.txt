Wizards are not well designed for solo

Unfortunately, they are also not well designed for a group.

If you like your wizard, try a mage; they can do most
of what a wizard can almost as well as a wizard, but
also have the far more useful pets to actually contribute
with.

You'll be able to solo -or- group well, not just slog
away in an effort to get to the upper levels where
you'll finally be in some demand... not many wizzards
ever make it to the post 50 game, so the fact that they
are marginally better -at that level- than mages won't
likely make much difference to you.

Bergh

PS: ok, that wasn't a straight answer to your question...
try this:  How much -do- you have to spend?  Yes, you
said not thousands.  Hundreds?  Tens?  Some gold?

Also, what have you got?

General guidelines:  Ignore your AC and melee abilities.
You'll never be able to take a beating, you'll never dish
out appreciable damage... in fact this gap between you
and tanks or even healers will widen further and further
as you level up.

Get one handed weapons, not the two handed ones... to
the extent that you bother working on weapon skills at all.
This way you can equip one item in each hand instead of
just the one.  Since your hand held items are principly for
stat and saves boosts, this gives you twice the potential effect.
You don't even need a weapon in hand most of the time, if
what you can afford are two one handed non weapon items
with the right stats, take em.  Your melee skills won't take
out more than an annoyed green... and your AC and HP might
not leave you alive long enough to do that!

Get INT boosting items... at your level mana boosting items
are better, but each time you level up they will become less
useful, while your INT will produce more mana.  Get that
INT all the way up to 200 before looking at mana boosting
items to go further.  Mana total is all important to you as a
wizzard.

Group with level 16 enchanters, who can keep you breezed,
and your targets Tash'd Since your contribution to a fight can
be measured in mana spent, Breeze, Clarity, and Manasong
are the most effective force doublers you can find.  Tash line
(and later the Malaise line of Mages and, um, necros?  is it?)
mean you will get fewer resists and partial resists, so that the
mana you do spend will do more damage.  Grouping with
several 20+ level bards, once you get up to where you can
get exp with them, will enable you to actually blow some
real Nukage into even the average fights and still stay High Mana
enough to do your real job of emergency slaughter.

Don't cast yourself OOM in a normal fight.  Drop a nuke or
two and go back to medding... we want to see you capable
of standing up and -devastating- a mob or two in a massive
bad overpull, but have no interest in sitting around while you
med back up to full from a fight we could easily have done
in another 30 seconds melee at no mana cost.  Unfortunately,
this is why the wizard class is generally not useful; it does
less to speed up the "mobs per hour" kill rate than any other
class out there.

Do max out your spell casting skills.  Each time you level, go
sit somewhere safe and chain cast your cheapest spells in
each class until you've hit your new cap.  Noone wants the
wizzard chain fizzling in an emergency, and there's no real
reason for the wizard to be casting regularly in anything
-but- an emergency, so your skills will never go up if you
don't practice.
