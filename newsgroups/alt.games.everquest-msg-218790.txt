LMBO!  I'm sorry to hear you are having troubles...  :(  Damn Sony...

I figured it out though...  I use the find button on the new BL, then double
click (ok, click repeatedly...) on the name I want to find and indeed a
mystical path does open before me...  Of course, the people I need to find in
Shar Vahl aren't listed on the find list, but what the hell...  LOL

Thanks Annie!
