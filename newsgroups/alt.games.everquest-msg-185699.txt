How do you get EQ to quit going into, or starting up in, Windowed mode?

I was the Bazaar earlier, set up as a trader, glancing at the screen
occasionally while playing War of the Monsters on my PS2 when all of a
sudden EQ suddenly went into Windowed mode by itself.

I logged off, but haven't tried logging back on to see if its still in
Widowed mode, but I'd like to know what to do if it is.
