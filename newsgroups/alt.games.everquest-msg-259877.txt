I covered this point,let me quote from my first post:
"Sure,indoor pullings "sucks",but outdoor,thanks to Harmony,
Rangers make fine pullers."
Harmony working indoors would be the number 1 on *my*
wishlist,not better tanking abilities or more damage output.

Guardian of the Forest.

Depends more on Equipment.

Make up for what ? A little more dps and better pulling abilities?
As you said,Rangers get snare,track,invis,some not too bad buffs.
Balanced if you asked me.

Again,see my initial post about group composition,I dont see your 
point here,comparing Rangers with Clerics for example makes no sense.

True,I didnt say Rangers are invited *exclusively* for their invis.

I was comparing Berserker to Rangers,there are other classes like
Pallies  who require the group to leave their peculiar camp in some
circumstances.
And where did I talk about soloing?

Druid Tracking 255 is a bug not feature.

Quote from Patch message 28.April:
More Npc's in Qinimi now leave tracks for trackers to  find.

SEQ and MQ? - Show EQ ,I dont know the other,and I thought
we were talking about playing honestly,not using cheat programms.

Thats just you,I have other experiences.
Last adv I did ,I found a pretty useless looking back item,
bit it gave 2500 Tribute points,you dont care for 2500 TPs?

Its 20hp per 6 second,helps the cleric not to waste mana with
overhealing,lowest heal I have memmed with my cleric is about
1200 hps,so every time I heal an Int caster at 80% I waste mana.
Regrowth does the job better,maybe its just me but I like all members
of my group staying at 100% health.

Playing with a SK friend most of the time,I know very well that
pet pulling is slow,harmony pulling is much faster.
Same for FD splitting,it slows the group down a lot.
Cant remember when I had Harmony resisted the last time,and
you know very well that it is extremly rare to be resisted.

I have my doubts about parses,everyone uses Yalp,but it doesnt
count magic damage in the right way,how can you be sure that
it calculates the other damage right ?
Druids maybe do more - as long as they have mana.
Other point is that Rangers can stay out of AE range from mobs,
which worked nicely yesterday doing Terris Thule.
So here is a very unique abilitiy of Rangers,they can sustain a
high damage output endless without taking any damage.

Well its just another point,but you cant say its worth nothing.

As mentioned before,I dont trust parses,so I have to rely on my
ingame experience,and this tells me that Rangers are a gereat dps
class.
Other *anecdotal* point is ,that I noticed doing Ldons with 2 Rangers
(Hunters of course) mobs tend to die much faster than in the usual 
group.

And keep in mind,you are playing the very high level game,while
I am playing more the mid level game up to pre elemetal raids,(hard)
Ldons and rarely doing GoD trials.
