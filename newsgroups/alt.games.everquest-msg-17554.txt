   If one just considers only the stats, then yes, gnome
is certainly not the best choice. The best overall, I
would guess, would be ogre.  For good races, barbarian
and dwarf are also excellent choices.  This is why one 
sees so many players choosing these races.  I played a
barb warrior for a short time, and she bored me to tears.
I wanted something a little different, and little more
challenging.  Its fun to run up to a group that is 
advertising for a tank, and announce that this gnome is 
the toughie they were looking for.  I like her hot-keyed
war cry, "Aiieeah!  Death from ground level!"  It's just
more fun, for me.  The only stat that is really lacking 
is strength, and this can be made up fairly easily with
jewelry and the like.  And I know she'll look awesome 
when she gets her first Really Big weapon.
