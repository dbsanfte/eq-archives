You may well be experiencing a known bug (assuming you know that you
have Luclin properly registered and have been there before.) If you can
get into the game and not into that character, I would suggest the
following:

Log into a character who is *not* in a Luclin zone during prime hours
and see if a GM or guide is online and petition. If you don't have any
other characters who aren't in Luclin, it's easy enough to just make a
quick naked newbie level one someplace in the old world and use them to
petition. The GM's can "move" you out of Nexus until the problem can be
resolved.

Also e-mail Sony's tech support at the same time. Cover all your bases.
