Welcome to PoP mobs vs CC

You will soon learn that everybody was right when they said Verant are a
bunch of cockmonkeys. I have 355int 305Cha, lvl 65, All AA's in spell
casting subtlety (Mobs notice you magiks 20% less).

2 mobs inc, cast mez (apathy or Bliss) resisted whack whack whack dead. Will
never change. The mez spells Apathy and Bliss are shit to say the least,
totally underpowered for the environment for which they were designed. There
is no way to alter the tactic to cope other than root (hope it sticks) then
mez it to stop if beating on tank.

A good example of Bliss for you. Wandering around WC other day I see a young
toon killing a wisp. He was doing well and was going to win...just. I notice
that incoming to him was another wisp, I cast Bliss (Me lvl 65, mob lvl 8?)
and it resisted the spell. /cheer Verant and their designers.
