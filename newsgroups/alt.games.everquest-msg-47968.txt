If you have the cash (and the items you listed, Scott, imply that money is no
problem), get a Karana idol (3 WIS, 2 vMagic, ranged slot; player made) and
replace one of your forest loops for either an electrum black sapphire earring
(2 AC, 35 HP, 25 mana; player made) or better yet, a gold black sapphire
earring (0 AC, 35 mana, 25 HP; player made). You would keep your 201 wisdom,
loose 3 DEX and 3 AGI (mainly for melee, and I don't expect you are meleeing),
no change in AC if you get the electrum or -2 AC if you go for the gold, gain 2
vs magic, and end up with additional hit points (nice) and mana (VERY nice and
significantly more than with the extra wisdom.) I'm not sure about the
formulas, but you might end up with more mana by replacing your second forest
loop with a black sapphire earring, too.

If you are annoyed at losing the dex with the forest loop, replace your ulthork
hide arms with imbued Vale sleeves (2 WIS, 2 STA; player made. Studded gives 6
AC, reinforced gives 7 AC.) You will lose 1 or 2 AC (negligible) and bring your
wisdom to an even 200, but will get rid of the -3 DEX of the ulthork.
