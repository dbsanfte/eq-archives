Invisibility won't be a problem for me if I use the Necro; I have a Harvester.
And I have Luclin; if they don't have it, I'll get them the spells. I figure I
can let my pet, buffed with Focus Death and Impart Strength, take on her pet
while the Paladin and I take on her. 

Won't be going after her for awhile, though; my Necro just reached level 14
about an hour or so ago.

Might bring a high level Druid and Wizard as backup in case Vashoon appears
instead or Holly interferes....
