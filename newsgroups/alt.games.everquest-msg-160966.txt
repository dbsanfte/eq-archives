So your telling me if a level 60 has 250 str, and a level 60 has 100str,
there won't be a difference in hit damage?  I beg to differ.

I used to group extensively with a friend of mine (another monkey) the same
level who was primal'less and we tested on lots of occasions.  Now hes in my
guild with primal the difference is all but gone

Ok fair enough, so "only" 16k damage per minute

To some people it will always be their "uber kill"...  I remember when a
guild I was in killed Lord Bob / PoF demis, and it ranked on a par with my
current guild killing Gylphed/Cursed cycle (second toughest mob in ssra)...
I doubt anything will surpass our first AoW killing tho, and killing Tunare
was a pretty sure second

Well never doubt a persons stupidity thats for sure, but running to the RC
setup spot -
zone in, turn right, follow the wall high up, without invisibility and all
of 2 brain cells, you get to the spot with zero agro
