I must have missed it, or it was after I left.

When I play my young rogue, I never pickpocket.   Only while soloing to
raise skill.  I even take the button completely out when I get a group,
since I don't want to hit it on accident or out of habit.

Not really, no.  At high levels you still get very little amounts of coin,
and with autosplit going 6 ways, it would be near impossible to tell.   The
"valuable" thing a rogue could steal would be gems.  No way to know if there
were gems on the mob when it spawned or not.


>Do you expect them to?

Absolutely not.  I've heard all the lame justifications "I only pickpocket
when I get aggro, cause that means the tank wasn't doing his job" (Yah, your
aggro control sucks that badly, but it's the tanks fault) or "I only do it
cause I can't port myself, so I have to pay for my port at the end of the
night." (and none of the other melees you're stealing from have this same
expense...)  the truth is, if you feel a need to cheat your group members in
a game that is supposed to be fun, theres something seriously wrong with
you.  No way in hell I want to play with an ass like that.

I hesitate to group with anyone I don't know, so I guess it doesn't make
much of a difference to me.   If a rogue is in my group, it's cause I've
known them forever, and trust them with everything.

As a side note, I do know several good people, who it does piss off enough
that they will not accept a rogue... any rogue.. in thier pickup group.

Making the rogue pickpocketing steal from the group was one of the more
damaging changes they did to the rogue class, IMO.
