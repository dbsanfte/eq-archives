Your desire to frame things in terms of usefulness is off the mark.

Your right, of course, that the Time Flag, or the VT key, or any other 
endgame status symbols from various expansions are 'useless' unless you 
actively raid those zones, but that doesn't matter in the least.

In practical terms GM smithing is generally useless once someone in your 
guild is a GM smith. Its invariably more efficient to just use them. 
Ditto the other tradeskills. And yet people still pursue these flags and 
symbols and trophies in droves just for their own sake, not for their 
usefulness. Or maybe perhaps there are that many people who are deluded 
into thinking that if they can just get to Vex Thall or Time or GM 
Smithing or whatever that it will actually be 'useful'.

I tend to agree. But I'm not concerned about pickup raids in time for 
loot. I'm concerned about people disrupting their own guilds progression 
by leapfrogging around on the backs of others. I'm curious about how 
pre-elemental guilds in general are faring in terms of progression. Its 
very hard for a guild to "progress" through raid content right now as a 
unit because its so easy for individuals to leapfrog into higher level 
guilds.

Think about it this way. You as a high end guild hate repetively going 
back and backflagging members. Back when the population was thriving you 
set flag requirements and refused to look at people too far below you. 
Then as the population waned you had to start taking people farther down 
the chain and catching them up... this was tedious so you got the 85/15 
mechanics. Great. Problem solved.

The trouble is not all the so-called "feeder guilds" want to be feeder 
guilds. But the ease at which *individuals* can currently advance 
through a significant chunk of PoP prevents them from retaining people. 
Between an individuals ability to get 85'd in to on open raids and the 
ability of guilds they are apping to get them up to speed quickly I'm 
suggesting its making it virtually impossible for new young guilds at 
earlier stages of progression to retain talent.

I know of at least a few guilds who seem permanently stuck in early pop 
because members keep leap frogging to higher guilds. I'd be a fool to 
blame that entirely on gimping but it is a definate factor.
