13.  And that's the not only my highest character, but the highest character
I've EVER had.  And yes there have been gaps in play (recently about six
months), but considering one of my mates now has four characters running
around at level 65 wondering when the next expansion's coming out, it's all
rather depressing.

Without wanting to sound too self-pitying, levelling and obtaining cash are
just things that happen to other people.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
