We keep them poor.

The *reason* we can afford to maintain our high standard of living in
the first world is because we are purchasing labour and goods from the
3rd world for a fraction of its value to us while selling them goods
and services at full price.

I'm not saying there is an easy solution, nor am i saying we should
just butt out of interacting with the 3rd world. But we can at least
cease being arrogant about how much we're benefitting them as we
exploit their economies to prop our own profits up.
