    On Test, when this was first put in, light blues gave no XP. Brace
yourself for that level of XP reduction.

    Actually, I feel miserable. I got a bunch of spells I didn't want or
need, and because of that other classes will get spells that they don't need
or will feel left out. This was handled very poorly.

    The XP needed to be raised on the group mobs. It makes no sense that a
level 60 mob, pre-change, didn't even give as much XP as two low-blue level
45 mobs. As for the soloable stuff, well, /comfort. That's going to stink.
Maybe with the DoT changes, though, you'll be able to pair with another
druid and take on some fairly challenging mobs?

    /hug. Hey, 80 slots on vendors! =)
