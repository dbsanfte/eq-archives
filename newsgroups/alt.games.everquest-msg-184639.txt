I've done it with a friend within the last six months. I had my beastlord,
she had her wizard and she wanted to work on her melee skills. We sat in
NRo by the zone line. We dueled. I summoned the Gecko of Doom, a pet that
was still blue to her. Didn't buff it. Sicced it on her. She meleed. When
she got low on health, I'd /pet back off, she'd bind wounds until she was
ready to go again, then sic pet on her again. I just sat and watched the
her and my warder fight, made snide comments, and buffed and healed the
folks zoning in from Oasis.

We did that for, oh, half an hour or so. She got a pile of defense and
dodge skill ups, but not so many offensive ones because she'd forgotten to
load up on dex gear. And capped out her bind wounds, too, I think.

FWIW, she never got the gecko below 96% health :)

I might try a similar tactic with my rogue. When I'm doing my job right,
I don't *get* aggro, so my defense and parry aren't maxed at the moment.
