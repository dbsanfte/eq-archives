OK I had a really strange thing happen twice in the last week.  I'm hanging
out minding my own business when I start getting the message "You cannot
possibly consume any more food or you will explode" or something to that
effect.  All of my rations were in my bags and I did not even have my
possessions window open.  I checked my rations, and sure enough a lot of
them were gone.  I feel like such a glutton!

Not a big concern, I guess I can always go on a diet, I was just wondering
if this has happened to anyone else.
