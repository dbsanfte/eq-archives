Problem one:  Skill goes up on number of spells cast, not on
amount of mana spent.  As a young cleric I probably cast far
more roots than any other line of spell... but spent no more than
a tenth my mana on rooting.

Problem two: Tactics change as you level up.  As a young
druid I'd certainly have said buffs were my largest mana
expenditure.  As I leveled up further, I spent more mana
on nukes.  Higher still, it was DOTs that got most of my
mana spent.  Looking ahead, its likely that AE nukes will
be next to be "majority mana expenditure".  Then there's
healing to consider.. .oh wait, I said druid, never mind that.

Problem three: Even considering what you spend the most
mana on, what you want is not necessarily to save mana on
the things you do the most or spend the most on, but rather
perhaps on what is the most crucial.  Take that druid, for
example.  Yes, at one point DOTs were his main mana
hog -and- his most cast spell line.  But when the chips are
down and there's someone else relying on him to pull their
butts out of the fire, its not with a DOT, its going to be a nuke
or a snare or a heal... something that will effect that fight NOW.
As a cleric I specialize in healing... even though I've gathered
far more of my exp on root and nuke soloing, healing is what I
can do that will matter.  If I have to med up a bit more mana
to get that final nuke off, no big deal.  If I run short on mana to
heal the MA before the mob dies... then we could be looking
at the difference between a kill and a raid wipe.

Comment: Although the game documentation says that
specialization is a random effect, it isn't.  Careful experimentation
has shown that in fact it Always works exactly the same way,
to the tune of 2.5% savings at skill 50 and 10% at skill 200, and
proportional to that in between.
