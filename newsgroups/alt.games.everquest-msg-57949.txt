  I don't think so, that would be cool though.  Something like:

/pet orient <direction>

  So "/pet orient north" would make it so your pet always always following a
few steps directly north of you.  Or you could set it to south, west or
east, or nw, ne, sw, se.

  Or, so your pet orients itself relative to the direction you're facing...

/pet orient <position>

  So "/pet orient back" so the pet will stand behind you or "/pet orient
left" so the pet will stand to your left.

  Probably isn't worth coding, but I have experienced what you're talking
about a few times and it is a bit annoying.  As "Eq Caster" noted, the best
way you have of during this currently is by having them return to a certain
out of the way position every time with /pet guard here.  It works well for
camps, but if you're on the move it's not really practical.
