Did you read the bill?  Have you read anything other than my posts?  If
not, I wouldn't poo-poo the folks that are "stirring things
up" quite yet.  

Now, if you have some savvy with legal-ese, and you can read that document
and counter the arguments on EFFs webpage for why the law is written
broadly, I encourage that.  I'm _not_ that great with legal-ese
myself...though given hours I can probably dig my way through it.

As Dennis pointed out, things don't always make it into court. Becuase of
the one-sided legislation clause, a lot of people would be encouraged to
keep things out of court.

*shake head*  I'm probably not make a good case for my sentiments on
this.  It's not my desire to get into a heated debate, but to simply
inform folks.  If I'm mistaken, then I apologize heartily.  If I'm not
mistaken, then I stand by my desire to share it where folks might give a
damn.

One last link, not legalese, but a simple case of one person's letter to
their representative, and that representative's response.  I think the
letter to the representative explains things far better than I can.  As
you may notice, they don't refer to firewalls explicitly...it's covered
under "Widely-used home networking equipment" in the third paragraph.

Make of it what you will, but again...they say it better than I have.
