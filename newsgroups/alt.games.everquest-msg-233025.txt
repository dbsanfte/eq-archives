I'm almost 100% certain that it does.  Perhaps someone was confused
about the corpse dragging change they put in about 6(?) months ago. 
Dragging a corpse makes you KOS regardless of your faction in Kael. 
This is to prevent someone from killing a few Dwarves, getting non-KOS
faction, and acting as a corpse dragger alt for Kael raids.
