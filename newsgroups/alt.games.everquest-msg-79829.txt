Well, I went again tonight. Gawd, that makes 7 times! A record for me for
ANY movie. And it's been held over for another week, so you know what you'll
be getting from ME in this thread :) I agree with you, and in fact, was
thinking about it on the way home. I told my sister-in-law that it wasn't
just that he was a "pretty boy", it's mostly him in combat. I absolutely
love watching him use that bows and those elven knives (not that we were
treated to much of that, but hey, I enjoyed the bow and arrow stuff enough
for both weapons). I've always been very attracted to capable, competent
men, especially when they have brains. Computer geeks and geology professors
are more my type. I really think it might be the combat thing, now that I've
given it more thought.

Of course, I -may- have to go see the movie another few times to be
absolutely sure that's what it is ;)
