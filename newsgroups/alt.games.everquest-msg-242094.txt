my mouse is an optical mouse. it is a new mouse and is not dirty etc as i
have read on various sites as a possible problem
the problem only exists in eq, otherwise it is fine
i have noticed that my old mouse needed lest movement of my hand to move
farther on the screen. i have placed the mouse on a different surface to see
if this helps
could it be a setting in eq?
i am not moving the mouse when the curser bounces to a different location on
the screen. it is not just shaking or uneven in its movements. it is
actually moving from the middle of the screen to the left side etc in one
motion, on its own. it is random as far as i can see.
