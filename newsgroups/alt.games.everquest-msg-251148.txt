"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
