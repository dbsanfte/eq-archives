I just passed the 15k mark on my bank account (ok, actually it just went
*pop* up to 15800), and other than stuff on my "dream list" (ie fungi, AoN,
Lodi shield, golem jawbone), I don't know what to spend it on.

If I buy a Jade Reaver now, I'll just end up selling it again for more
profit, so I'll probably do the buy/sell loop a bit on it once I see one up
for sale. (wouldn't think of selling a reaver obtained on through guild raid
though)

But in all honesty, I can't think of anything (droppable) that would be a
major upgrade for me unless its a *major* upgrade that I most surely can't
afford (once again, fungi, AoN, Lodi).  Of course if the fungi tunic gets
nerfed soon, I'll celebrate and buy one. (please to be retroactive!)

My equipment is listed at
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39316  and have other gear on
alternate profiles also (testament, frog crown, 5 all resist neck)

I like to keep resists up on my normal hunting gear, as well as decent
ac/hp/wis/mana, and then there's always the clickables (bracer and necklace
mostly, but earring also even though it's really not very useful).

I'm thinking Bone Bladed Scimitar, at least to hold me over until I get my
epic, but I really kinda like the fire resist on the Dark Ember... (no, I
don't want a paw or PKT, besides, that warrior in me screams when I don't
have a weapon)

I'd like a shield of bane warding, but unfortunately they're never sold, and
I lack the patience to camp the vah shir skellys (longest camp I did was for
my testament at 3 hours, I can barely force myself out to EJ to check the
gorilla for tainted, and after killing one or two, that stupid crusader
chases me out), the priorly mentioned Golem Jawbone is also a never sold
item.

I was thinking about a Luminescent staff, but I'm not sure how useful it
would be to me, and it's also one of those never/rarely sold items, it would
probably be nice though for a backup.

Other than that, I have no real ideas, I've got faction for Thurg MQ's but
the only piece I really want is the BP, and it's still out of my price range
(plus I'd then be utterly broke with no real way to make back any money with
trades), working on faction for SS, but price is even higher on those
pieces. (and besides, I'd really rather get the armor on a guild raid, since
armor MQ's are non-recoverable when you upgrade, though I did buy the Thurg
bracer just so I could get rid of my ES arms since I had no luck in Kael
with a bracer)

If anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate it, especially since I'm
usually the one dispensing such equipment advice =/, this entire post makes
me feel like a bloody newbie, heh.

Oh, and no, I don't want a horse.
