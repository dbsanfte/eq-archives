I can understand why the guy is annoyed.

I had this yesterday. I thought it was Verant. Then I swapped over
ISP's...and I was fine.

Seems all of a sudden my ISP cant connect to EQ. It's done so for months at
my brothers house...and the irony is, I just bought EQ Deluxe, and signed up
for the ISP at the same time. Money wasted?

Damn :(
