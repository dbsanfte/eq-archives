    40 raw ATK and a 0.6 ratio offhand versus 0 ATK and a 0.7 ratio offhand.
As a monk, which would you have gone with? Epic also has vastly superior
stats, and no aggro-enhancing proc. If you want to test out what the
difference will be, try parsing yourself with Wonderous Rapidity instead of
SoV. That's 41 ATK, and should give you an idea how much DPS you'll gain in
PRI making the change. Then multiply your offhand DPS with WR by 6/7, and
then by the percentage increase in your primary DPS, to simulate the DPS
change there. It's rough, but it should give you an idea about the DPS
effect.
