falsehood.

You took up the contrarian stance to Charles patient explanation to
you. In other words you argued with him. Trying to claim now that you
"weren't there to argue" is either dishonest or ignorant.

Semantic bullshit. You were doing exactly what I said you were. You
were tossing out apologist arguments in favor of ebay style
transactions being legitimate. I don't give a rat's ass if you don't
really believe it, that's what you were doing.

Argument: A discussion in which disagreement is expressed; a debate.

Having established you took up a stance which was disagreed with, and
given this definition of argument, it is logically proven that you
were debating. Your words are, in effect, even more semantic bullshit.

Here's some friendly advice for you - let those who actually believe
what they are saying defend their argument, if they can. They are not
hampered by this need to pretend they aren't "arguing", this need to
pretend it's just an innocent intellectual exercise. You're
(obviously) not equipped to handle the fallout from taking such a
position; witness your total meltdown in response to what was actually
pretty mild of Charles's response in the first place.

Why you're so blind to the reasons you got hostile responses is beyond
me. You seemed like a smart person before; you really should have
known better than to play "devil's advocate" with this. Would you go
onto a pro-Republican forum and "play devil's advocate" by throwing
out extreme liberal interpretations of everything, shifting your
stance to another as each position got knocked down, never admitting
any points against you?

Do you think people would react well to that?

This is just intellectual blather. There's no difference. Either stand
up for the points you brought up by fighting the rebuttal or admit
them. This plugging your fingers in your ears just invites attacks,
and deservedly so.

I can't be held responsible for your learning disabilities. No one
requires my "approval" for anything. Just don't start a fucking
whinefest when your bullshit gets called out for what it is.

What you are in this thread is a troublemaker. If it was more
deliberate, and we had less evidence of you being much less of an
idiot in other places, you would be accused of honest to goodness
trolling like Michael was. Is that really what you had in mind? 


>>>Nevermind. You win. King Ben rules usenet, blah, blah. Happy?
>> 
>> I hate slimey defense lawyers.
>
>Me too.

Then why do you act like one?


>Surely you can wrap your mind around the concept of discussion without

>else to say. 

The evidence of your own quotes defies this backpedal. If all you want
to do is backtrack, admit you have no answer for the counterpoints
Charles raised instead of retreating to this haven of "oh my god he
said BULLSHIT woe is me!", and stop shifting the goalposts.
