Those fights are there in WoW but you'll never see most of them if you
play for an hour at a time since most are in instances. If you're
fighting elite mobs, the pacing of the combat reminds me a lot more of
EQ. I think I've had more 'cool' fights in WoW than I did in over 5
years of EQ. ... but if you're mainly soloing outdoors in WoW, you'll
never see them. 

One thing EQ1 never figured out is that it can be just as much fun to
fight multiple weaker mobs. EQ lost a lot of it's 'fun factor' for me
when they started making you fight single mobs at higher levels
because most groups just couldn't handle an add.

I got over that attitude after my first 8 hour CR in Fear. CRs in EQ
always meant that you just didn't go to some zones unless you had
someone along to get your corpses out. Making death basically
meaningless like in WoW does make the game loose a bit of excitement
but I think it makes up for it by allowing you to try things that are
way over your head, especially in groups. 

My biggest beef with WoW is that the zones have a 'gamey' feel to
them. You'll never see a zone like the commonlands where you have to
dodge Hill Giants and Griffons as a newbie and I miss that.
