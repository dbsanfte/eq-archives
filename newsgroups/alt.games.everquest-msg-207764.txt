Hello,

My friend sent me a link to where I could get a free download and a 1 month 
free trial of EQ, so I downloaded it and got an email with the registration 
code, and all works fine, except I can't log in. 
When I go to see my account status on the Sony Station website I am told 
that my account status is "initial" for a "1 month" period and there is a 
button to "subscribe". 
So if I press the subscribe button do I get charged for this first 1 month 
or do they charge me after the "initial 1 month"? 
I imagine that they will charge me after the first month but want my cc 
details so they can verify who I am, but I want to be sure that they don't 
charge me for this first month. Any info is appreciated.

Kind regards,

Liva
