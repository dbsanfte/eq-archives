not.  What I wanted to indicate was my thought process that went into my

to keep my curiosity high and to draw me back sooner rather than later.
Also, if what I write here gives enough information to other potential

that I was not able to do.  If others come to the same conclusion as myself,
I would like to read that too.

I haven't tried WOW but I really like EQ2 and I'm kind of surprised at the
particular problems you are having because it's the ease of questing that is
one thing I've found to be a lot of fun in EQ. Perhaps because I'm comparing
it to the difficulty of following a quest in EQ1, and you are comparing to
WOW. I've never had any trouble getting help from a guard. Sometimes you
have to be closer to the NPC, so you just need to keep asking guards until
you find one close enough. Sometimes using the right name is important too.
Usually I can just type in the first name and I get a response.

The journal does a good job of keeping track of every step of the quest and
if you forget where you got it or what to do next it's really easy to look
back at the journal and it will tell you exactly where to go to return the
quest item.
