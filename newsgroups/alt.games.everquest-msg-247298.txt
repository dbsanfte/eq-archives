I think, and I'm just as guilty, that a lot of people bought the 
expansions on hope that the new content and features would both a) be 
improvements, and b) breathe a little new life into the game. It seems to 
me that would explain the rush of expansions over the last year or two. 
It might be taking more and more to keep people interested at this stage.

I think the OP has some decent points to make. I vote non-troll.
