I have the most fun playing my enchanter when I'm either in a group / guild 
situation where we have a lot of adds to control ( maximum excitement ) or 
when I'm charming stuff.  I didn't do a lot of charming earlier in my 
enchanting career, except for a brief stint in the last teens where I 
charm-duoed with another chanter.  Without snare, it got ugly now and then.

Now that I'm higher level, I find that duoing with a Druid is great if you 
are fighting animals.  Druid snares, I tash, charm the mob.  Druid snares, 
I tash, she grabs her pet.  I haste both, then we find something that needs 
to die and sic the pets on it.

With harmony and the lull series, you can find a camp with 5+ mobs and just 
constantly mow through it.  Try to charm mobs that hit hard for their 
level, too.  I don't know when Druids get charm animal ( level 20, if I 
remember correctly from the Pyzjn days ), but if you can get that high as a 
duo, you can have a lot of fun.  Learning the skill ( ut oh, I used the 
"skill" word ) of charm-killing is a good thing to do early on because an 
enchanter later in life can add a LOT of damage to a group by charming the 
correct mob.

Until the Druid gets high enough to charm, you can try aggro-kiting or 
fear-kiting with your animation or a charmed pet, but you will want your 
charmed pet to be snared a long with the mob you are killing.  SoW is 
obviously nice to have when your pet breaks charm.

Standard EXP groups are boring to me, unless you are constantly pushing the 
envelope.  A lot of groups don't want to do this because they don't know 
what to do when it gets pushed too far and things get hairy.

Griffawns make great pets as you get close to level 20.  Charm one ( or two 
if the Druid has charm ) and let them go to town on gorge hounds, reavers, 
and if you have a higher level Griffawn charmed, the crag spiders.
