Ah, you have a 2 sec period of wasted time before it recasts, then?  I
usually recast as soon as the casting time clears, but that's always been
more for timing than anything else... 2 hits of bellow, 1 hit of selos, or
if the mob is slow, 3 bellows and one slow.  If I just let things recast,
then I get inattentive.  I didn't realize it changed the timer as well.
Thanks for the info.  I'm sure I'll pester you again when I get my charm and
fear songs.
