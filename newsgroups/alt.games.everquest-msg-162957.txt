Sounds like you've found a home - go for it :) I have no plans to have 
an ebay account.

How people can equate Bank robbery to wanting to sell on a second hand 
game is totally and utterly beyond me. I buy all my games and when I 
tire of them I sell them on. Usually a game I buy for �30 I sell between 
�5 and �10, its not about making money, just allowing a small return at 
the end. Which justifies me buying another game.

I've paid around �100 for this game, probably more, to have even a 
fraction of that I would be happy. I haven't got super characters or 
anything like that. I literally just want to sell a 2nd hand game.

However its against the EULA so end of story.

Miles
