	Politcal liberals are very likely to buy into
deconstructionist/postmodernist tripe, which basically states there is no such
thing as objective reality and "truth" is just an expression of power.

	The funny thing is that this is colossaly stupid, of course.  Best
explained by a quote from Alan Ryan cited in _Fashionable Nonsense_
(Sokal/Bricmont):

	"It is, for instance, pretty suicidal for embattled minorities to embrace
Michel Foucault, let alone Jacques Derrida.  The minority view was always that
power could be undermined by truth...once you read Foucault as saying that
truth is simply an effect of power, you've had it.... But American departments
of literature, history and sociology contain large numbers of self-described
leftists who have confused radical doubts about objectivity with political
radicalism, and are in a mess."
