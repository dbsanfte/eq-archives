Debatable. I don't think you'll get nailed for it, though.

Fuck yes, you bet your sweet ass it is...

If you're giving a hard hitting mob a low dly weapon while it's
fighting somone, see above.

No, just makes you a total asswipe.

Yes.

>5)Kill stealing

Yes.

Note for the 5 above, on Sullon Zek these and other "grief play"
tactics are perfectly legal. But on any server, they will all make you
an asshole and ruin your reputation on the server. If you do these
often, hope you don't expect to go on any raids...
