DirectX 7.0a is not needed for Win2k as the fixes in 7.0a are Win9x
specific.  There are instructions pertaining to this on the Microsoft
DirectX site.  That's why there is not an install for Win2k.  That said, EQ
runs fine for many people running Win2k (without DX8).  I have tried
upgrading to DX 8 and that caused me to have to reinstall Win2k because EQ
didn't not run properly afterwards.  I suggest though, that you look at your
video card drivers and sound drivers.  The Everquest site also has some
specific instructions on the order of installation for DirectX and drivers.
