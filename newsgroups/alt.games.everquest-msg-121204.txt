No, since SWG is this december or so (beta july to fall etc) and EQ 2
is a year and a half off. They are not coming out at the same time AT
ALL. EQ 2 is the NEXT december.

Likely I'll try both. Many people don't seem to get that EQ2 is a year
and a half off and many of us have played EQ for 3 years already. I
myself feel that I have exhausted all it had to offer a long time ago.
