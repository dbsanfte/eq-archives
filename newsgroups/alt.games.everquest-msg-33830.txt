Well, between the two choices you provided, it is the latter, the NPC aggro
on them immediately.  The best way to find out is to stay well outside of
aggro range, and con the NPC, if it cons "scowling, ready to attack", then
he will attempt to kill you as soon as you get within his aggro range.  If
you don't know how to con yet, you right click with your mouse on the NPC in
question, or you target him, then type /con.
