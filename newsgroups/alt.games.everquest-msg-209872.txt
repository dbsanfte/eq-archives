Wow, I'm glad we have you around to judge what is and isn't acceptable
gear for any given level. Gonna publish a list so we can all make fun
fo the newbies when they don't live up to your standards?

Or maybe they just prefer to spend their time doing stuff other than
farming? But hey, they can always buy some plat on e-bay so that they
can live up to your standards.

If my twinks had that attitude I wouldn't ever have to worry about
grouping, since almost everyone is gonna have worse gear than me.
Personally, I'd much rather have an underequiped lvl 30 than someone
who's gonna pick groupmates based on their gear. the former will get
better gear eventually, the latter will always be an ass.
