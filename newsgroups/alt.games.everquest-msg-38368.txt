You are mistaken.  I just created a dwarf with *70* agility.  He runs at
28.9units/sec.  Then I created another dwarf with 105 agility and he runs at
28.9units/sec.  So you can see that having under 75 agility did not slow him
down at all.  OTOH, being hurt will lower BOTH agility and running speed.
But it is not the lowered agility that hurts the running speed, but the
being hurt.
