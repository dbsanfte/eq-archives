The OP might also want to check out Xnews. It's my personal favorite 
windows newsreader. It's free and is constantly being updated (if you don't 
mind using beta versions). The stable releases are also good. It's got just 
about every feature one could want.

Did I mention I'm a big fan of it? ;-)
