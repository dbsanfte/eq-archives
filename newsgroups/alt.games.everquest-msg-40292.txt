I'm so glad that Mozilla 0.9.3 and Netscape 6.1 have the BUILT-IN 
ability to disable the window.open() function without disabling 
JavaScript ;) Also the ability to block advertisement banners too, all 
built-in, no need for a proxy server or plug-ins. Same with the very 
very nice looking skin and other skins availible, no plug-in needed. 
Same with support for alpha blending png images, no plug-in needed. Same 
with advenaced support for CSS3 styles which are not supported by 
Internet Explorer, no plug-in required. I could go on all day hehe.

Mozilla - For people who are not afraid of change
