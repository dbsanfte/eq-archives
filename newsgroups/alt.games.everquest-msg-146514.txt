Every time I read that I like it better.  It reads (to me anyway)
as a restatement of the Golden Rule from a Libertarian perspective.
An examination of the implications of either can lead you to the
other.  Also worth noting is that there was a famous Rabbi (whose
name escapes me :( ), a contemporary of Jesus, who sumarized the
6000+ commandments of the Torah in terms equivalent to the Golden
Rule (concluding that summary with:  "the rest is commentary").
And I'm pretty sure that there's a similar moral statement as part
of the core teachings of Buddhism.  Doubtless there are many other
religious and philosophical movements/shools that also have this as
part of their doctrine.  But that's the first time I've seen it
presented with such a Libertarian flair.  (Sometimes I think I'd
like to be a Libertarian, but I'm not, although I am very glad
they're among us and with us, our world would suffer for the lack
of them.)
