And welcome to The Nameless!  It's not often that I see someone here that
plays there.  The Nameless, for whatever reason, has a high percentage of
Asian players, most of whom are from Taiwan.  It probably depends on what
time of day you play too.

Anyway, my wife and I play there with several characters.  My main is
Turtylduv, 35th level bard, member of Hand of Justice

Hope to see you around!
