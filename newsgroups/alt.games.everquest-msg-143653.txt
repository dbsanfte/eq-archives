}Thats the whole reason I'm asking WHAT to buy and for HOW MUCH.  Using the

}and then also for how much.

Also keep in mind that prices vary wildly from server to server.  However 
much we say it is, odds are it costs twice as much on some servers, and 
half as much on others.  And shooting your mouth off about how so-and-so 
on the internet said it cost is only likely to make the price go up.  Also 
beware of "oooh, on the net they said it was worth X, and that dink is 
selling it for X/2, I'm gonna buy it, mark it up, and resell it, 
muahahahaha!"  That's almost a sure sign that on your server it's been 
selling reguarly for X/3. :)

There's no sustitute for sitting there searching the bazaar engine and 
seeing how much the stupid things actualy sell for on -your- server.
