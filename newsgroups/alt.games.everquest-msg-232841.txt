Subject: Cleric Raid Priorities

My guild is too small for a *complete heal chain*.  I am a newbie at this
stuff, we normally raid places like Air and Cazic Thule ... little stuff.
I am usually the leader of my group in raid situations.  I usually have one
*tank type* in my group.  We do always have a MA though, and the MA has never
been in my group.
Should my main priority be the MA with *my* tank being secondary?  Often times
my group is completely healthy while the MA and her group is getting smashed. 
I've been casting heals on whatever tank I can target that needs one if I have
good mana and my group is healthy.  This, of course, means that *if and when*
the mob gets around to my *tank* I may be running low on mana.. which would
certainly suck, since *I'm* supposed to be protecting my group.  Or am I????
Is the MA the one I should be truly focused on?  This would seem logical
because the warrior with a zillion HPs is the one I should keep alive, not my
paladin who is lower level.
Should I be trying to keep an eye on other clerics health?  I notice I almost
*always* get healed if the mobs hit me.  Could someone suggest a priority list?
 
It's hard to try and target a bunch of people who aren't in your group... is
there a simple way to do this?
