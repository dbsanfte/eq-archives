Being a resident of the one of the most recent non-split servers (Vazaelle) and
also a player on the Karana Server (old server), I can verify that the older
server's economy is much, much more inflated than the newer server.  I see
things routinely sell for as much as four times more on the older server than
on the newer server.

As far as level 60's and the uber-guilds, on Vazaelle the uberness seems
manageable and I cannot speak with any authority about the guild situation on
Karana.  I have characters on Karana, Vazaelle, Seventh Hammer and Tholuxe
Paell (sp?).  7th Hammer and Vazaelle have been my favorites, but that's simply
one player's opinion.
