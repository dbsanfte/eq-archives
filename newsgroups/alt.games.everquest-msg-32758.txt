At 19th level and only 200(ish)pp to spend, I would recommend
getting +mana items rather than +wis.

On SolRo you could get the following

2 Moonstone Rings - +3str +30mana (6str 60mana) - 30pp ea 
1 Zaharn's Coronet (head) - 5ac +3str +25mana   - 40pp

Thats +9 str (to help you tote that Bronze armor you can afford with 
the leftover pp) and +85 mana. At 19 it would take 21/22 wis to get
that much mana. Not something you could probably do with 200pp.

Cheers,
