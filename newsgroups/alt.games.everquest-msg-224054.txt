Don't blame us for thinking your lower than pond scum.

According to who? You? And we should care what you think why?

Oh great... your one of "those" winners. Kazaa [lite] has many 
quasi-legitimate uses (out of print music, public domain music, even 
sampling music in advance of buying the CD)... but using it to avoiding 
spending 13 lousy bucks on the new Eminem CD isn't one of them.

I'd almost bet you are one of the multitude of punks who leech from the 
network too.

Wait for them to offer a 30 day trial key.

Or bite the bullet and spend 9 lousy bucks on the basic game and play it 
for a month. That is a pretty cheap way to find out.
