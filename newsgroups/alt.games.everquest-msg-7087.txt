I have (what I believe) is the latest version of the Kunark CD (has patch
program 1.2.2).  I installed it fine, and ran the patches so I'm up to date
on those.

Then I installed the Scars of Velious andit completed without any problems.

However, when I fire up Everquest - there is NO option for the Velious
patch?  The button simply isn't there.  I JUST reformatted and reinstalled
my OS (Win 98) and I had the SAME problem before I reinstalled.  My other
machine is fine, as is the one I'm typing this on - but for some reason,
Velious patch does not show up on the one machine:

PIII 933
512MB PC133
30GB Western Digital
Voodoo5 5500
Soundblaster LIVE! Value
Creative 52xCD

Anyone else have this problem and get it solved or have any ideas on what's
up?

(The program does show up in the add/remove programs list)

Thanks.
