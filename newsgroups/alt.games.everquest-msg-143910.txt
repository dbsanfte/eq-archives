I doubt new epics will be added. The same rumor circulated around
before the Luclin launch, and what we ended up with is the Twilight
Sea quests, which are meant to be done in the 40s, are really
difficult and tedious, and most of the items are below par even then.
As for why people would want epics, it's more of a status thing for
most classes. They look neat, they're hard to get, and not everyone
has one. For certain classes, the epic is almost a necessity. Look at
all the grief the Ragefire camp causes for the cleric epic, for
example. And a high level mage is considered incomplete without the
epic pet. Plus not all others are utter crap. My main is a BST, and
I'll be going after my epic as soon as I ding 51.
