Yeah, its worth it to play EQ at work if you might get fired for it.

Uhh.... NO ITS NOT.
Take it from someone who has screwed up a large portion of their
life/work in various ways. Nothing is more important than your job
record/performance. You might think some small thing doesn't matter
and you can just get a job somewhere else if fired but IT DOES. Build
all the bridges you can and burn none of them.

I don't know, but unless you really have nothing else to do at work at
all, I'd try requesting projects and such to do during the downtime.
Even asking if you could do some light cleaning/sweeping would likely
be looked on favorably.
