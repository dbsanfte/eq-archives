I was browsing around the Everlore Geo boards yesterday checking Lake Rathe
zone/mob layouts and I was reading about a Kraken - evidently removed during
beta due to pathing problems and moved to OOT.  There was also some mention
of the Megalodon.  Any of you old timers that have seen it all ever run
acoss these guys in the game, live - post beta?  There was some talk that
the Kraken is triggered by killing all of the sisters, but as usual with web
board debate, somewhere the topic got spun off into the posters flaming each
other and an charming post or 2 by the Kraken *cough* itself.

Anything at all or is that all there is?
