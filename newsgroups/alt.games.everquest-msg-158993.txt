    When my guild first got to Plane of Valor, we were the only ones there
and we XP'ed cheerfully. Then the other guilds started pushing people up
there, and it's turning into a sewer. Trains every minute, idiots running up
to other groups and Feigning/Escaping trains onto them, morons kiting right
through groups - just amazing how stupid some of the other people are. For
those of you that have been there - we're talking people kiting undead right
through the middle of a Razor caves group that is hugging the shoreline.

    I wish it was like that on my server. We have bards swarm kiting on the
beach right near the zone-out, and they train out a lot. I had a group of
five there on Saturday, waiting for a friend to come so we could journey on
to the castle. Watching a dwarf cleric kite six mobs around a wide circle
while the group kills stuff, one by one (every so often I'd stop and Sup
Heal the tank) must have been funny for the bard, as he did it to us twice.
And I'm not talking about accidents - he ran tight circles around us as we
fought until his swarm peeled.

    When I was there, 100+ people in zone. It was a zoo. It was a guildmate
with his friends from a long time ago, so we had a level 53 paladin tank.
With Aegolism, he had 3000 HPs. I was using my fast heal as a 50% heal on
him. These people really shouldn't be there, but they are, and they like to
run.

    Oh, and don't forget when people train the Junk Beast to zone! I wish
mobs like that would just summon people and kill them on the spot, rather
than run after them.

    The Enforcers in the spellfest hallway before Mavuin go light blue at 62
and hit for 200, so I'd think the rats would be soloable. I don't know if a
55 mage could do it, but it's worth a shot. Do you know if the guards assist
the rats like they do the prisoners?

    Heh. I'd say they're lower HP mobs than anything else we've seen at that
level, by and large. Remember what level some of these things are! In PoV
the mobs we XP on are levels 61 and 62. That's a very high level mob for XP
grouping.

    Those spiders are 56+. They are wimpy compared to Juggs, true, but think
about the other 56+ mobs you've fought and how they compare. Like HoT stuff.
How do they compare then? And a red mob is what, level 64+ ? You're talking
King and Queen in Chardok for comparables then.
