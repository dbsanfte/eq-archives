Does not fit the facts !

80% of lottery winners are bankrupt within 5 years. 90% of millionares are
self made. Im sorry you have such a skewed view of capitalism but skewed it
is.

Does not fit the facts. While the south used slave labor the per capita
income of the aggregate was FAR below the north. People work best when they
work for themselves.

The soviet union has just as much if not more natural resources then the US
does. Our per capita income was and is so much above theirs to not even be
funny.

China has the longest history of any country on earth. While the rising tide
has risen all boats they are still in danger of starving in masse in a bad
year.
