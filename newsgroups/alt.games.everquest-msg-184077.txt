We cleared Fear last Friday.

Fright is the one that DTs.  Fright shouts "Zymyool!"  *unding*

Terror has the nasty AOE.

Wraith of a Shissar drops the Chanter epic piece that Zymyool rolls a 238 
[ /ran 200 500 ] when he's only rolling against one other Chanter.  Missed 
that bottleneck piece.

Last night, went to Hate and one Essence dropped.  Rolled against 2 other 
Chanters.  Lost.  Lost on the Insidious Robe.  Lost on the Insidious Arms.  
Won the Gloves, at least.

Chanter epic piece dropped, mage piece dropped, necro piece dropped, 
warrior piece dropped.  There was only one shaman there, and he pretty much 
walked out with a full set of armor.  He got his epic piece from Fear last 
Friday, too.  No SK on the raid, so Bloodmoon rotted.

2 recent trips to the planes, 0-2 on epic pieces.  *looks for new dice*
