    There are two types of quested armour in Planes of Power. One,
elemental, requires No Drop elemental molds/patterns which only drop in Tier
Four (elemental) and above planes. The other, ornate, requires tradeable
ornate molds/patterns which drop in Tier Three zones (BoT, HoHa/b,
PoTactics, Sol Ro's Tower). It is my understanding that the quest NPC you
need to deal with tells people that don't have a flag for at least one Tier
Three plane to sod off if they try and do the ornate quest, but this is not
firsthand information.

    The legs I was referring to are the leggings made by a rogue using an
ornate pattern.
