If you pay someone a lot less for something than you know it is worth,
I consider that stealing, even though it may not be the "illegal" kind
of stealing.  That's why you should feel comfortable trading with me
in, say, WoW ... I won't blatantly try to rip you off.

I can't think of one thing that Microsoft has genuinely invented on
their own.  Well, maybe Clippy, but that isn't a good thing :-D
