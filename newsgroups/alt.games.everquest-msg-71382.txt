It is no surprise at all that games adopt the popular/successful innovations of
other games; that has been a standard business practice ever since "business" came
in to being. I would disagree with your claim that 90% of DAoC is ripped off from
EQ, though... the setting and ultimate goals of the two games are substantially
different.

The point of my post was to illustrate the increasing number of things that Verant
has stated categorically that they will never EVER add to the game, like horses
and non-PC dependent binds, are in fact being added. I strongly believe (but would
be happy to be proven wrong) that this is because Verant sees DAoC as a threat,
and DAoC has horses and allows all players to bind freely within most towns.
