That's the high level body summon.

There is a lesser summon corpse level 12 that uses a black ceremonial
coffin.
And the summon corpse spell that uses a Jade inlaid coffin which is a
container and will not stack.

I cast most of my buffs on my self, solo or grouping.
Saved my ass many times. Exceptions would be the resist buffs which
are situational.

There are tons of spells that use components.
I am assuming you are just listing ones where the component is used up
because there are some spells that just require you to have the component on
you but doesnt use it up.

Levitate - various classes uses up a Batwing
Enduring breath - various classes uses up a Fish Scale

Mage Phantom armor line (self only) uses 1-4 cats eyes depending on level of
spell.

Mage pet spells use a Malachite.

Necro pet spells use a bone chip.

All the enchanter 'enchant' mana spells use gems from pearl to ruby
depending on level.

Many priest classes can imbue gems to be used in various trade skill
armor.
