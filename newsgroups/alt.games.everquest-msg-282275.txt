Then he kites too fast. You have to find the optimal way to keep on
killing. And if you notice your mana dropping too much just ease off a
bit and use one dot less next time. Unless you are trying to learn a new
kite spot Meldur is absolutely right. :)

You can expand that concept to groups too. If you run into downtime
every so often then you are killing at a wrong speed for that particular
group. :P
