HighKeep, not the Hold, but the Keep itself.

Down in the dungeons, you can level pretty fast and there is a bind spot
just up the stairs. Makes it REALLY convienent to bank all the boots and
other loot. With all the diff rooms you can hunt in, the XP is just about
non-stop. Yes the trains can be bad. Yes the pathing sucks. But really,
where can you go that has a bank SOO close to that many mobs AND a "Get out
of Death Free" card thanks to old Ran Flamespinner (Wizard trainer that hits
for over 300+ DD a shot) that kills all the gobs that come close?

You've got alot of options, have fun and try out a few.
