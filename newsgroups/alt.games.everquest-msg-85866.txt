If you would read more of the posts to this and other forums, you would find
out
that my views, tho somewhat extreme, are shared by a large group of other
players.
I appreciate the civil manor that you responded, since it beats the flames
that I COULD
have had thrown my way, but after playing since EQ went gold, I have seen
them
bypas many broken or unfinished quests to implement things like epic quests
and
other things that were made for lvl 50 and above. I am not saying I don't
want these things
to be put into the game, just that maybe they should fix what has been
broken for almost 4
years as well. This new Legends server seems to promise many of the same
things that Verant
promised to us since day 1. Dynamic questing, a living world, and customer
support both
ingame and out. My HOPE is that they will live up to their VERBAL CONTRACT
with
the origional game, as well as supply excellent support for the new Legends.
But my
suspicion is that one will suffer for the other. At 39.99 a month service
for Legends and
9.99 a month for normal, which one would YOU concentrate on if it were YOUR
company?
