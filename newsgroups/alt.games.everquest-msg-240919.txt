Actually multiple posters then showed you that every single group you
posted had a majority of bottom posters. You just ignored them, like
you pretend not to see all the people mocking you now.

Doesn't change the fact you were proven wrong and then lied about it,
then and now. Thats why you're being called a liar, Andrew.


>At no stage did I defend top posters or any type of poster.

This is another lie. At one point you even lied about whether or not
YOU top posted. Got burned on that one too, didn't you?
