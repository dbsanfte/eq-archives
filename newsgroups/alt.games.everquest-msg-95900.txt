hmm, i havent seen an amd catch fire,  or at least the one im runnin hasnt
for the past 2 years.
personally id go with an amd
you get the most bang for your buck
as with any amd you need a big Power supply so 400 wats is a plenty as with
a case, i saw a site that was sellin a antec sx1040b case for 99 bucks i
think great deal
cpu: amd athlon xp 2000+ or fastest out
mobo: abit kr7a-133raid great for oc'ing plus you never know when you are
goin to run raid
memory: crucial 2100ddr, over the past 6 months prices have tripled, 768m
should be plenty
HSF: put up aside fear of settin fire slap a alpha pal8045 with a big fan on
it and some arctic silver3 thermal compound
video: gf4 or ati radeon 8500, now i know that there have been probs with
radeons, all of which i experienced being an owner of a radeon 64mb ddr
vivo, but i think that verant has FINALLY worked through the probs and ati
FINALLY came out with a decient set of drivers
disk drive: STAT AWAY from IBM deskstars,  with very recent news that they
reccomended time ran each month for the drives is 333 hours leaves me
wondering what is wrong with their drives. check out www.viahardware.com for
more info
 go with one of those western digitals with 8mb buffers,
www.storagereview.com did a review of them and they believe that they were
faster than scsi drives
sound: SB audigy
display: as big as what can fit on your desk

as for the os, winxp should run eq just fine, winxp isnt as bad as people
proclaim, since its only the fisher price version of win2k
just my opinion
