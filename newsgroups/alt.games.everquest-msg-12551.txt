	This is the problem.  People listen to half of what's said and go around
repeating incorrect information.

	Root as ghetto Jolt is not reliable -- it breaks too easily and the other
PCs tend to move around too much.

	Still, Rangers below 45 are quite capable of tanking.  It's not until you
start fighting the really big stuff that crunchiness becomes a factor, and now
that Jolt is moved down to 51 it's really not that big a deal any more.
