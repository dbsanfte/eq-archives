Indeed.  Using similar rule of thumb calculations, I get
around 10 DPS using my melee weapons. If my melee
output is 2/3rds my nuke and sit output, then its not
so clear that I should be doing strictly nuke and sit, after
all.  Particulary when you consider that the "sit" part
only accounts for 22/30 of the mana available, and further
that with a little effort I can actually pick up that other 22
points much of the time by sitting only when I swing.
Conservatively, using "bounce" techniques, I should be
able to do half again as much damage as a same level
cleric who does nothing but sit and nuke. by nuking at
FM, then bouncing till FM again and repeating.

Course you'll point out, rightly so, that cleric nuke
output isn't exactly all that either.
