Yep, sam programmer who clarified recently at the trade fair that the
highest of int or wis only affect skillups as well as the secondary
stat. He clarified that nothing affects success. So if you have 255
wis and 240 str as a smith, it will help you for skillups but it is
not helping you one single bit for success. The fact that you have 190
smithing is the only thing which helps your success and no matter WHAT
your skill is there is ALWAYS a 5 percent chance of a failure.
