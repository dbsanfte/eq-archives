Bit like players using variations of an important or well-known fantasy
name.  I have seen that many variations of Legolas it isn't funny.  My own
name 'Taliewin' is a variation of 'Taliesin', main character in the first
book of Pendragon Series.  I have seen other variations of Taliesin on my
own server.  (Yes Taliesin is not allowed under the naming filter).  I
suppose you could call it an exploit, but it is just saying 'Hey, Taliesin
is my "role model" if you like'.  Now of course some names take it too far,
but hey, it is not totally wrong to use a certain variation of some names.
I don't think VI would have a problem with my name, even if I told them why
I chose it.

Taliewin Lifesworde
Divine Fellowship
Half Elf Paladin of the 48th Rank
Mith Marr Server
Follower of Jesu
