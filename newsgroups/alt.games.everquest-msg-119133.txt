Hmm, I assume you're referring to this bit from another sub-thread?
quoting...

you:
"I don't recall that bit. All I recall is they had logs of the
conversation among the guild. I don't recall a single mention of the
GM communicating over the guildchat."

me:
"That's not a surprise, as you don't seem ever to recall anything
that contradicts your latest pronouncement.  Did you go to Conquest's
web site at the time and read the logs they posted, as I did?  Didn't
think so."

While I certainly wasn't taking a pleasant tone, I see quite a bit
of difference between my sarcastic use of a specific cite and your
snipping of the relevant assertion in johnc's post while calling
him a jackass.  In fact, given that johnc was contradicting you
from his own experience in support of what I had posted, I fail to
see where my "swipe" was "unprovoked".  Also I see nothing in any
post in this thread as childish as your namecalling.
