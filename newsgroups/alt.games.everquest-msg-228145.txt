The thing that makes me seriously wonder about how "good" your guild is 
is the fact that there was any debate required by the officers.  A member 
scammed someone, they bragged about it in guild chat, if your guild was 
indeed one of the "good" ones, he would have stopped being a guild member 
shortly after bragging about the scam.

Personally, I would not continue to belong to a guild that would condone 
such behavior.
