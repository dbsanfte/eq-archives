No it doesn't. It tries to gloss over the fact that if a program 
requests it, it can be allocated up to 20% of your bandwidth:

By default, programs can reserve up to an aggregate bandwidth of 20 
percent of the underlying link speed on each interface on an end 
computer. If the program that reserved the bandwidth is not sending 
enough data to utilize it completely, the unused portion of the reserved 
bandwidth is available for other data flows on the same host.

Take note of "not sending enough data" and "on the same host".
	          ^^^^^^^			        ^^^^
I speculate if an application requests bandwidth but doesn't use it you 
may still be able to use the full amount of bandwidth for sending data 
to the same host, but receiving data from the same host or to and from 
different hosts is a completely different story. I would either be very 
careful to reboot before playing Everquest and make sure no other 
applications are active in the background which could possibly use 
bandwidth (email clients, instant messagers, automatic updaters), or 
simply turn off QOS altogether. On a single machine using one 
application you don't need it.
