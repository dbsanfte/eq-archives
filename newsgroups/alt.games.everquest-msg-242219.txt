if someone already said this then forgive me, i don't have time to read the
whole thread.

    the lesser summon corpse is a necromancer spell that is obtained at
level 12.  you can offer to buy the coffin, but from my experience most
necros did not want to accept my money and told me to keep it to spend on
other things (of course, being a necro myself, i only had to get other
people to summon for me from level 10-12 so i only had it done a few times
so maybe i'm not the best person to ask about donations).  however, now that
i am a big level 15 (WOOHOO!) i often find myself taking pity on the poor
little newbs who have lost their corpses in dangerous places.  only once
have i asked for money (and thats because i was 14 and he was 15).

so i guess what i'm saying is that you should find someone that is a higher
level than you and seems to be a nice person.

PS
whenever i want something done for free, i usually go to a crowded area and
say "looking for a charitable <blacksmith, necro, enchanter, whatever,
depending on what you need done> to help me <insert favor of choice here>"
this usually lets people know that you are either a newb or really poor (in
my case both) and someone will usually send you a /tell offering to help.

PPS
when you tell everyone you need a favor, ignore the asshole that shouts back
telling you that no one will help you.  i responded to one of those guys
once and made a fool of myself with the whole zone listening.
