No diety restriction on the gear.  Druids/Rangers starting in Surefall
can be Human or Half Elf and may follow either Tunare or Karana.  The
only non-SFG Druids that can use the Pine Druid gear are Half Elves
worshipping Tunare that start out in Greater Faydark, as the gear is
not usable by other races (allowing non-twinks from SFG a petty little
chuckle at the expense of their Halfling cousins who get a really
crappy scimitar, heh, dunno how good the GFay gear is).  The best of
the Pine Druid gear is the Tunic, Bracers, and Scimitar.  The one piece
<not> to bother with unless you are obsessed (as I was) with getting a
complete set is the gloves, they are inferior to the common-as-dirt
Split Paw Gloves and require two of those damned rare Giant Field Rat
Whiskers.  Also, if you are not averse to killing a few bears (as my
Karana following Druid was not), a Medium Quality Bearskin plus a few
gold (15?) will get you Bear-hide Boots from the female Miller, which
are AC 5 and have Extended Enhancement 1, quite a bargain for a starting
character.  And that Scimitar is a very nice lowbie magic weapon:  6/27,
MAGIC, +1 WIS, and maybe a point or two of STA, can't recall.  If you
could get someone to kill the Defiler for you (just inside the secret
passage behind the Druid tree) you could do that quest at level one with
enough copper to buy a few sharpening stones (dunno if they're available
closer than Erudin tho).
