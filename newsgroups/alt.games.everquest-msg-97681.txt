That would explain the whole reason for the verbal warning, then, if
he was firing the same over and over.

My advice here would be to teach through example. Approach a GM and
request a new name on the basis that yours violates the rules.

One of the big reasons behind the rating on the game is the factor of
so many other players. There are many people who tend to make efforts
to skirt all kinds of rules, including vulgarity and lewdness.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not an advocate of sheltering kids from
reality. They probably see just as bad, if not worse, in school or
even just walking down the street every day. I'm more in favor of
teaching them why it's inappropriate than sheltering them from it.

I was a tad harsh with my response. Reason being I see so many people
come in here playing the GM/Verant-bashing game over rules and GM
reaction to violations. Many of them blow things out of proportion and
try to paint themselves as innocent victems of "tha man". Not
something that sits right with me. I'm the type that, if pulled over
for speeding and I knew full well I was speeding, I would accept the
ticket and likely even apologize to the officer.

And one more thing... I'm a he. ;-)
