Well in the average exp grind group a chanter or bards chore responsibility
is always crowd control.  So I think they do fill the same role, albeit with
a different approach.

Bards can do so much, but most of their songs are multi-class things.. mez
and charm and mana are a pretty specialised line of spells, so thats one of
the things about bards that stands out, and what people are more likely to
notice first.

-m  <-- who doesnt get a bard if he has a group chanter, and vice versa
