If you do more total damage than a caster over the course of a fight,
your DPS is higher *when measured over the course of that fight.*
The fact that one is sustained damage and one is spiked has little
relevance as long as you measure it over an amount of time.  You
may as well pick a measure of time to measure it when the casters
aren't doing any damage at all.

Since DPS implies a time component the whole argument is weak if
you only pick active cycles, which is exactly what you're doing.  And
the person you're responding to actively picked a time for the DPS to
be measured.

*Burst* DPS for wizards (or any class with nukes) is higher than any
melee I've heard of against raid-level mobs.  *Sustained* DPS (which
is what we're talking about) isn't, by a long shot, over any sustained
encounter or over "the long haul of a raid."

You may as well argue that a VW Beetle (the old ones, not the new
ones) have better acceleration than a Corvette Stingray.  That was,
BTW, generally true *for the first few inches* since the Beetle rarely
would waste HP spinning its wheels due to the low axle HP and the
position of the engine over the rear drive wheels.  But people would
still look at the *sustained* acceleration over any *meaningful*
measure and say you're wrong.
