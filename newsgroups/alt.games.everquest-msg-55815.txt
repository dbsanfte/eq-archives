My initial impressions of this fun little bit of functionality:

First Monster: a decaying skeleton (1st level), Warslicks Woods
-----------------------------------------------------
Got to run around a bit and explore without giants trying to squish me.
Killed a scaled wolf pup and another decaying before falling to my death
near the goblins.

Lessons learned: I am a nightmare to other 1st level beasties.

Second Monster: a black bear (7th level), Rathe Mtns
-----------------------------------------------------
Killed three other black bears in succession, and then tried to zone.

Lessons learned: black bears are skilled linguists who have mastered all
known tongues, and several unknown tongues.  Unfortunately, zoning doesn't
seem to work particularly well (i.e. monsters can't).

This is quite a lot of fun, and could add to the game, but it could easily
become old hat.  I'd like to see what they do with it.
