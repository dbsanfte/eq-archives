You spoke of hundreds of companies, each with one channel.  That 
condition would be completely abnormal for a free market.  THe only way 
I can conceive of it is right after the channels were sold or otherwise 
issued in a completely unfree and regulated manner, exactly one per 
customer, irrespective of what they are willing to pay.  And if there 
is a free market in channels, there will almost instantly be a re-
distribution that will result in a distribution of companies with 
different numbers of channels.

That's not what you described.  You described a distribution in which 
all companies effectively have a single channel each.  That is utterly 
implausible in a free market.

Are you speaking of categories where a person requires either 1 or 0 
such item, and the items are being sold second hand?  That has little 
relevance to most markets.  Because of a particular circumstance, each 
seller has exactly one item to sell, and each buyer buys once, so 
naturally there are far more buyers and sellers numerically than in 
normal markets.
