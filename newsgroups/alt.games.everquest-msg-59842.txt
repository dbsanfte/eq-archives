I believe that the "high enough level" theory doesn't apply to guards.
They're fearless, in my experience. In my high forties, one of those two
idiots that guard the inns in E. Commons attacked me when I was running
by.  This week, we were hunting guards in W. Freeport (helping a guildie
SK get damaged militia helms for some Darkforge quest). I was pulling
guards from near the militia house, and there's one wanderer that comes
past there who is WAY green to me at 51. (Doesn't even do a bub of
health damage to me before he goes down.) He charged right in and
attacked me every time.

I dont' know if it applies to the most extreme level ranges, but
certainly most from what I've seen. And if you're talking about walking
in the front gate, you can forget it. You'll never be high enough level
for that. Friend of mine is a 59 warrior. Two weeks ago we were in the
newbie area setting up for a Lucan raid, he was screwing around and
wandered too close to the gate and the entire guard force there charged
out and attacked him. Your monk will never walk safely into that gate
without either being invis or doing some faction work.
