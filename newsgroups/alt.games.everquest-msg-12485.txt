You still have to be just as careful, and you'd best swim with your head
above water. I used just that method when I was bound in FV and fighting
in Lake of Ill Manners. The idea that river travel is "safe" is an EQ
Urban Legend (tm). First of all, I have on more than one occasion come
upon drachs sitting *IN* the river. Secondly, if one is standing right
there by the bank and you swim past, you will be in aggro range, and you
will be just as dead.
