Although I should point out that a beastlord's major weaknesses are (1) the
time it takes to bring up pet and buffs, b/c we're not very powerful until
we cast our pet spells and our buffs... that means that if I'm waiting for
combat to cast my spells and I get jumped, I'm toast.  (2) without buffs
we're not very powerful.  So we have to make sure that out spells don't time
out in the heat of battle, and sometimes we don't have the luzury of time to
recast.  So for those reasons I think beastords are more balanced than we
could be.  Still way overpowered tho.
