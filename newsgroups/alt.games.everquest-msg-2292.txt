It is all faction based. Shamans start out with enough faction to talk to
the spirits. Other classes, if they can GET this faction, can do it easily
enough. If earlier portions of another epic give truespirit boosts, then
there is no reason whatsoever that you would not be able to talk to the
first spirit at the very least...heck, do the first several steps of the
shaman epic, they are pitifully easy, and that gives you buttloads of
truespirit boosts.
