Which kinds of names? Quote the rule.

The rules also say that the rules are set to promote a fantasy RP
environment. You'll also find that the GM has final say on what fits
in that environment. They're called "guidelines" because they're a
general idea of what's not acceptable, some spelled out in stone more
so than others. The SPIRIT of the rules is obvious to anyone with the
intelligence to form sentences.

I say the same to you: There are other people besides you playing the
game. If you pick a name that goes against the spirit of the game and
one that you KNOW will disrupt the experience for others, YOU are the
one being selfish and inconsiderate, not the guy who reports you for
it.
