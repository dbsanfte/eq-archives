Not unless it was also a poke at all Americans. It was a suggestion
that the ISP's that market themselves as the 'easy mass market choice
for technical illiterates' (We'll get you shopping on the interweb
in no time, and you can listen to music too!) tend to attract the
technical illiterates. They in turn make.... mistakes.... when
learning online ettiquette, sometimes get their fingers scorched,
and then show their stuff by either saying 'oops, didn't know, wont
do that again' or going full on the offensive demanding that every
established user updates their standards of behaviour to fit the
newcomer.


You can probably see why the second mode of behaviour receives a
pretty derisive response.
