the trivial loot code basically erases any lore item off the mob if they are
green to you.This was put in to stop 30th lev toons killing every mob in
site looking for one item, then turn around and sell it to low level toons
for profit, As lore items were and are rare drops.so if these mobs are green
to you, and the item is a lore item they wont show up.So you need to either
start a toon and work him up to the level he needs to be to kill these mobs
or buy the item off lower level toons.Sad but true.
