You will not evade me, "no one" <fish@carp.net>:

>I had great fun playing a dwarf as a warrior

I restarted my wood elf warrior (agnostic instead of Rallos Zek, not
being able to wear funky dark red field plate won't hamper me too
much) and ran her to BB last night in order to get guilded, then
decided to head for the Kaladim newbie area.
That place is awesome. Lots of easy to see mobs, few players. I have
seen the light... as much as I love Kelethin, any future Faydwer
newbies are going to head to BB as soon as possible :) (So I won't get
to kill CB orcs here. Big deal.)

There were a lot of people shouting in G fay about the shark meat cult
being disbanded :) Kind of a shame, now I can't make my warrior an
ally with her own guild :p (I wanted to do that when she got a bit
older - ally would take something like 5 stacks of meat) 
It was downright scary what that quest did. My 38 druid got visible
exp as well as allied warrior faction with a very short stint (the
aforementioned 5 stacks)... wonder how many unskilled lowbie chars
there are out there now after overdoing that quest?
