My interests usually are tied into some long range goal that will benefit guild
and friends more than me running around trying to make new friends, although
those are always welcome. I tend to avoid SEEKING new groups, as I get too many
loot vampires who think they can help kill a mob or two, then expect me to feed
them gear/loot/help..
Some beggars have learned to play beyond begging at newbie zone gate, and I
actively seek to avoid that. Suspect the feeling is shared, and thats why the
tendency might be noticed by some who find it hard to group.
