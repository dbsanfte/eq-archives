Are you seriously suggesting a single spell that basically removes
upwards of 75 to 80% of the damage output of dragons is somehow not
broken?

Let me clue you into something very basic:

Zlexak is a Hoshkar clone in ToVN.  His AoE is 1250 DD disease based
nuke that's on a dragon breath resist check.  It's a 70% slow as well
tossed in.

Against 40 people, he can punch through and get his nuke to stick on
about 75% of the people (this varies depending on how long the raid's
been doing ToVN and their equipment).  That means every 12 seconds,
this dragon is capable of generating 37,500 hps of damage against your
raid.  Compare this to his melee which is basically 950 per pop but is
slowable.

That single paladin spell chain casted will almost completely remove
any significant damage from that dragon.

Now, would you like to give me a single example of ANY spell in the
game that is as broken as that?

>What Verant should have done instead ...

What Verant SHOULD have done was never even introduce that spell in
the game.
