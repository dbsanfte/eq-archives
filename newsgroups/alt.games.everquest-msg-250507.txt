Way to instill a strong sense of morals and ethics into your spawn.

Everquest is a great game precisely because any such cheat is found and 
patched as a matter of the utmost importance.

There *are* newbie quests(which result in some decent armor for lower level 
characters) and some good tips to make money(for example, hunt spiders or 
spiderlings and sell the silk you collect in the Bazaar).

Perhaps this is a good time to give your son the "No free lunch" talk?
