My only comment guys, is that this is the first game (as far as I know) of
this type that has been this popular , for this long, with this many users,
and the first time that THIS HUGE OF AN UPGRADE has been made to such a
massive game.

You can all speculate freely in hindsight, that "they should have known...."

BULLS__T!

If you think you can do better, GET OFF YOUR A_S AND  GO DO IT YOURSELF AND
SHUT UP.

They had I am sure millions of things to consider when doing this upgrade,
and yes there are problems, but they are working to fix them and I am sure
within a couple of days most will be delt with.  I am amazed that they didnt
need to bring the game down for a month.  They are basically making a NEW
GAME with all the improvements, and including the old content just for our
convenience and enjoyment.

Remember the size of this undertaking and show a little patience.  Did your
Drood have a perfect first quad kite? probably not.  Things screw up the
first time they are tried.  A human being CAN NOT POSSIBLY anticipate every
possible problem.  Verant are a collection of software designers, who have
shown a desire to continuously improve this world for our fun, and their
profit  (remember it is a buisiness they are allowed to make a profit).
THEY ARE NOT OMNIPOTENT,  OMNISCIENT GODS. If you are not happy with their
efforts , and their eventual success, like I said, GET OUT.  That is an
option available to you.

An hey, if your problem is hardware, I sympathize.  I havent gotten in yet
so I dont know if mine will work.  But I have a choice if it doesnt....
upgrade and keep playing. or not.  Getting out of the game is my ONLY
realistic, intelligent and moral way of reacting to dissatisfaction with the
company.  and I am free to COMPLAIN, here is the appropriate place:
eqmail@soe.sony.com.

COMPLAINING TO SOMEONE WHO CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT A PROBLEM (ie. everyone in
this ng.) IS ONLY BITCHING.  Bitching is unproductive and a HUGE waste of
time.  get a life.

Please remember it is supposed to be a game.  If it causes you this much
distress maybe it is not the right game for you.

thanks for listening,
Beecroftm.
