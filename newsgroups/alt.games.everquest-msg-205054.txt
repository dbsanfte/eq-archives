My equipment (subtitle: My clickies):

Bio orb (clicky blind)
Grandmaster's Wristwraps (clicky summon something to throw)
Bracer of the Hidden (clicky see invis)
Minimizing device (clicky shrink)
Holgresh beads (clicky eye of zoom)
Vizier beads (clicky identify)
Pegasus feather cloak (clicky fly)
Jboots (clicky speedy feet)
Manisi plant (clicky summon bandage thingies)
Amulet of necropotence (clicky illusion skeleton)
Crown of deceit (clicky illusion wood elf)
Ornate BP (clicky self-shield)
Ornate legs (clicky stamina buff)
Vanishing device (clicky invis)
Coldain ring (clicky DS)
Epic (clicky 40% haste)
Shovel of the harvest (clicky summon food)
Worker Sledgemallet (proc gate to OT weapon)
Anklesmasher (proc snare weapon)

I actually have more stuff, but those are the perma-charge or rechargeable
items.  I also carry an assortment of:  fungusbeast gland (clicky snare),
staff of forbidden rites (clicky rez), conjurer's stone (clicky corpse
summon), pulsating goo (clicky rez), something goo (clicky regen), root goo
(clicky root), root web (clicky root), at least two types of gate potions,
and usually more, a titan potion for when I want to play Godzilla, a
mechanical toolbox (clicky summon toolbox to recharge some items), clicky
summon fishing pole clicky summon beer thingy, mechanical fletching kit,
mechanical sewing kit, mechanical spit, mechanical summon tackle box, DS
potion, slow stone (3 charge clicky slow from Hate), fungi tunic, and I'm
sure I'm forgetting multiple items.

To go along with all those, my "standard must have gear" includes six 100%
weight-reducing bags (only one of which weighs 1.0) and a large coin purse
to reduce my coin weight by 80%.  When you enjoy toys as much as me, and
play a monk, the bags are almost as important as the toys that go in them.
