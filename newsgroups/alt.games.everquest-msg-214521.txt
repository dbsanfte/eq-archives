	Sneak makes you unnoticeable to NPCs, but only if you are in their rear
arc.  They can SEE you, they just can't HEAR you.

	Hide, of course, makes you invisible, but only until you move.  Mobs that
can see invisible will see through Hide.  Unless you are a Wood Elf or
puntling, you won't get Hide until level 25.  Racial Hide abilities are
limited to skill 50 until that level.  Both Hide and Sneak cap at 75 for
Rangers.

	Only Rogues get a message when stealth skills work.  Everyone else has to
guess.  The way to find out if it worked is to con a nearby NPC that would not
normally be indifferent to you.  If it cons indifferent, your Sneak or Hide
worked.

|At lvl 15, now I can get a camouflage spell.  Is this redundant ability to
|hide and sneak other than the fact that camo can only be used out of doors?

	Camo lets you move without being seen, at the risk of it dropping at a bad
time.  The spell has a random duration and gives very little warning when it
is about to fade.

	Do keep your stealth skills up to level cap, you'll find them useful later
on.  Proof left as an exercise for the reader.
