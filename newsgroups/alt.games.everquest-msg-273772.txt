Really?  Before WoW's release one of the common complaints I had heard about 
it was the lack of real customability of one's character.  The argument went 
that you could make yourself, say, a human male, but you'd end up looking 
exactly like every other human male in the game.  (Maybe it also included 
class, so a human male of one class would look distinct from a human male of 
another class, but all the human males of the same class looked essentially 
alike)

Did that change?  Or were the people who were reporting this problem wrong? 
Or is this new claim of yours wrong?

And just an opinion of mine based on playing games where you can make 
customized faces, unless you change facial features like chins, noses, eyes 
into grotesque, exaggerated features, they really don't make much more than 
a slight cosmetic difference.  The only thing that really distinguishes 
character facial models from one another are hairstyles.
