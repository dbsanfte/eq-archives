You are always going to get the pinheads once you need to sell something -
that is the main reason I can't be bothered to sell anything in EQ and just
choose to hand stuff down or give it away. Even when I go on holidays to
Asia in real life - I ask them how much something is and pay them outright
without bargaining. The extra money I pay for prices I just consider fair
trade for the convenience of not having to go through something I find
tasteful distasteful: haggling.

Trying to pick up something in EQ is like buying a fake beard off John
Cleese (Life of Brian) - every single transaction at times : /
