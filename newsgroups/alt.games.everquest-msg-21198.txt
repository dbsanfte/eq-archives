Definitely, keep everyone sowed if no one else is doing it. I'm a
cleric and that sow may never get used but when things go wrong I
really appreciate having it. And if you can, keep it from wearing off
on the puller, I hate having to go out find my puller who has had sow
go off and now has multiple mobs beating on him.
