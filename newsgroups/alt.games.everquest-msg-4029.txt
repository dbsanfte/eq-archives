Not to work on them in the same manner as you do to raise your skill
that high by making arrows and selling them back to the merchant, but
I make a good living on Fletching.  I sell 2 to 3 Darkwoods a week,
usually around 6 to 8 bows of all types included and over 10,000
arrows a month. 

And I know people with that kind of plat laying around.  I have a
friend that at level 53 has over 120k in the bank, you could probably
get from 202 to 220 with about 1/6th of that selling them back to the
merchant:-)  Especially with good faction and charisma.

But most people????  No:-)  Heck, I sweat bullets everytime I make
them.
