Thank you for your input, but, no, as far as I can tell I didn't do any of
those things prior to the problem.  At least the button isn't pushed off the
screen because of resolution (I have made display setting changes from time
to time).  Everything else looks normal.  A friend of mine says he vaguely
remembers hearing of a rare glitch that causes this, but he didn't remember
the details, and he didn't have a fix.  Very strange.
