   Uh-huh.  Your daughter.  Okay, if you say so *rolls eyes*.  
   But really.  Your daughter posts multiple, inflammatory posts, laughs at the

   Daughter or not, and I'm guessing probably not, you have some serious maturity
issues to work through.

Annie <--- Immature too.  But in a much better way.
