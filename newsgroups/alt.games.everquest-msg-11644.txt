In a simple word?  Slow.

Of course, not even Slow is enough to stop from getting ripped apart
in the high level game by something that quad attacks for the 200's.
But the simple fact is, a good shaman has enough AC to tank slowed
mobs for a group should they have to.  Would you want a shaman to tank
if there's any other tanking class around?  Probably not, no.  But on
sheer terms of being able to take a beating, a shaman can be at least
equal to a ranger.
