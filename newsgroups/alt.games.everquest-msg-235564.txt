If an item sells to a vendor for X pp, and goes to a tribute
master for Y tp, then we can find the tp/pp ratio Z.

If you're simply looking for the best TP for your buck -

If Z < 1 the item is better sold than donated
If Z > 1 the item is better donated than sold

There are going to be items that have Z > 1.  The
community is going to find out which easily farmable
items have decent Z values.

People farming for PP will farm these and charge some
markup over what a vendor would sell them.  At some
point the market will stabilize at some Z > 1

At this point, all items in the game have a floor pp
value of TP/Z

I personally believe they screwed the pooch on their
TP calculations.  The first model had +stats giving
some geometrically increasing TP, and skill modifiers
giving insane TP.  They also had something in place 
for weapons - likely based on base damage, although
I'm not sure.

The first thing I would have done is decided what we
wanted the floor of Z to be.  Then, tag everything you
consider vendor trash.  All those items should have
max_vendor_buy_price * Z TP values.  Then derive a 
formula for everything else.

As a side note, floor Z is actually greater than one
on some vendor bought items.  Z on pearls bought at
best price is around 1.25
