No, not quite.
Even the non-uber dragons can require multiple resists.  For example,
there are some dragons that have either fire or cold based AoEs with
debuffs, but even worse than this is they can proc Chaos Breath on
you.  It's a single target proc that does 1200+hps and tosses you like
gravity flux.  This is I believe magic checked.

Of course the uber dragons have multiple "special" abilities.
Sontalak for example will fear, but even worse than his fear is his
fire based attacks, especially the fire nuke procs given that he
freaking flurries ALL the time.

Sontalak is a first brood.  He's a tough mother.  I would recommend a
LOT of AC/hps.

The other dragons, Ionat, Entriaz, Dru-I'm-a-dark-blue-dragon-that's
not-visible-when-it's-foggy-but-I-see-invis, etc...range from fire,
cold and magic.

Ionat's AoE is Mes Breath.  AoE silence.  Sucks much ass if you're a
caster.  If you're a meleer, it's pretty funny how fast you can kill
this dragon.  Sort of a gimpier version of Xygoz...if you can ever get
a gimper dragon than Xygoz.
