I will never say those words. But then, I never advertise my services to
the entire zone. Well, OK, I take that back. Last night I offered free
rezzes to anyone who died in the train I helped pull to the zone. Even
with my train hotkey pressed LOTS- at least one person died.

I am either inclined to give a rez, and take whatever donation is
offered (and sometimes none), or I am not inclined to take the time away
from my group and give a rez. I think I've travelled twice to rez
someone. I've been called an asshole because I wouldn't leave my group
to travel to rez someone.

If they offer money, it may make me change my mind. OK, so I will take
bribes. If this happens, I will share money I get from the rez with my
group. For instance, someone in Rathe Mts died, and didn't know where
the corpse was. The rogue in my party found the corpse and dragged it to
me. I rezzed the guy, and healed him, and we watched over him while rez
effects dissapated. He gave me 200pp. My whole group did nothing while
he got his rez. Darn straight I'm sharing that with my party.

And yes, I offer money for ports, even when it's a guildie.
