>looking for info/stratagies on Plane of hate break 

The usual plane of hate break is:
Wizard portals his group up. First group contains either a monk or a
shadowknight who immediately falls over dead and observes the mobs.
Everyone else camps. Wizard gates and gets the next group when the monk or
shadowknight gives the all clear. Repeat until everyone is camped and in
the pre-designated chat room. Then everyone logs in simultaneously, groups
up, and your puller starts pulling.

3 groups to kill naggy? Doubtful. Very, VERY doubtful. Especially when you
are cut off from druids and bards, whose resistances are extremely helpful.
Lacking those 2 classes, bring 30 people at least. At least half of them
need to be melees of some form or another, 2-3 wizards for last-ditch
nuking, a pile of clerics to keep the melees alive, and 2-4 shamans to
heave buffs onto people.

People without UNBUFFED magic and fire resistance of at least 80 need not
apply. 110+ would be the desired resist figure.
