Sorry....I meant that if you are Neutral, you cannot tell the difference
between a member of the Good team vs. a member of the Evil team by how they
con.  Good people who want to fight only Evils cannot tell them apart from
the Neutrals simply by use of the /con.

An example:   those who are followers of Rodcet Nife, and want to roleplay
the NPC alliance between the Temple of Life and the followers of Karana in
Qeynos.  Those two factions are very much tied together, so it doesn't seem
to make much sense to have their player character counterparts killing
eachother....not unless there is a change in the NPC politics of Qeynos just
for that server.
