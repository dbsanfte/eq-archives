While I've had my share of "run-ins" with members of Dark Horizon, I
would neither move off Zeb (tried AB, didn't like it), or wish for
Zeb's top guild to be anyone else but Dark Horizon.

Before the butt-kissing accusations start, note the complete and utter
lack of character names in the post, and EQ 5 would be out before I
met DH entry requirements lol.

Dark Horizon are like any other guild on Zeb in-so-much as they have
their share of perceived assholes and their share of good, honest
people. If it wasn't for one (now ex) member, I wouldn't have had the
balls to attempt a named Revenant in The Grey (dropped Shissar Tunic,
big upgrade for my character).

A hell of a lot of people on Zeb have a lot of respect for Dark
Horizon. What goes down on the message boards when things like Waking
the Sleeper and the THO argument between CoP and DH (Dantos) happen,
you see all the people that are pissed at DH, but you don't see the
100x others that think you have every right to do what you do.

I thank my lucky stars that you guys keep pushing to stay at the top,
so that Zeb remains a FCFS server.
