(just a story about ATI drivers not working for me and a solution)

I dont know about any of you, but here is my experience with ATI drivers...
My system is....
AMD Athlon 1.4GHz
Gigabyte 7ZX-h mobo
ATI Radeon VE (32mb DDR, dual display)
512 Mb DIMM @ 133MHz

I used the ATI drivers on my CD that came with it, I could play any DX game
for an hour and it would freeze (mainly played on EQ and Counterstrike)
I ran OpenGL on CS, it would work fine for about 30 mins, it would freeze,
and OGL would crash every time I tried to use it, untill I removed and
reinstalled ATI drivers.
Tried the 2 versions on ATI website, the recommended and beta, same results,
but the beta one seemed to be a little better (didnt crash so quickly)
Tried Rage3d drivers, I messed up my system in the process, so I reinstalled
ATI, got fed up with that and tried Rage3d (7199 drivers)... after that I
was able to play either game flawlessly, its been workng fine for about 2-3
months now.
I dont know if that freezing issue is common or not, but if you have that
problem, just follow Rage3d's uninstall guide and give their drivers a shot
