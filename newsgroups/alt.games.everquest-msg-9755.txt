I am playing with 192 Mb, one stick of 128 and one of 64. Both are different
brands, but both were the most expensive ones listed under "A quality" at my
local vendor. I run Windows 2000, and the OS itself runs smooooooth for days
in a row. I do not experience the crashing issues, but only the more-or-less
standard issues that everyone has with Win2k.

I recommend at least 500 Mb of disk space free AND a 512 Mb pagefile when
playing EQ. I hear those page faults are due to lack of diskspace or too
small pagefile. I have a fixed pagefile of 512 Mb. Costs me 512 Mb of
diskspace, but i can miss it, and it is worth it for a stable system.
