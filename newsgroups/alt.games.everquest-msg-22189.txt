i say unrest and the trains there arent that bad as long as you stay out of
the front yard. i hunted there in a group for 5 lvls and as long as we
stayed in the back of the house he didnt get trained. altho i think entering
the zone is the most dangerous part of being there, just because you have to
walk where all the trains go. if you go there i suggest asking the people
sitting outside the zone in DC if there are any trains on the other side.
that alone can save your tail. but unrest is fun and as a cleric you
shouldnt ever have a problem there either finding a group or soloing. once
you get about 10 or 20ish you can start soloing in the house the front rooms
on the side only have one or two spawns and wont aggro the rest of the
house. and its good exp because of the fast pulls and the bonus you get for
going there. pretty good money too. altho you could also go to overthere and
fight at the mudpit. i went there at 15. you just have to be in a group but
in my experience there is alawys a group willing to have a cleric. and OT is
great money
