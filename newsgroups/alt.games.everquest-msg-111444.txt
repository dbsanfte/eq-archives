Well, this has been covered on a few occasions but here's my little tale
from last night;

In unrest at zone line, 51 druid in RP mode but you can't easily disguise
druids.

SK_01 comes up
SK_01 says "can I get wla nd a hel plz"
Druid "Can I have that in a language I understand?"  Seriously other than
the heal (because if his low health) I had not idea what he was saying.
SK_01 "Can I get wolf form and a heal please?"
Group with SK_01 turn him into a hound and give him a Superior Heal, he
scampers off to play with all the other hounds running around (another druid
in there giving out Wolf Form, somewhere)

Group gets ready to leave, story of why I was there not important.

Warrior zones in, as a hurt SK/puppy comes scampering back.

War_01 "Hail, Druid"
War_01 "can I get a sow bro"
Druid "I am sorry but you don't appear to be any relation of mine" To start
with he is a Barbarian and although I have heard lots of stories about my
mother, I don't believe any of them.
War_01 sighs clearly disappointed
War_01 "Lets try this again"
SK_01 "Can I get another heal plz"
War_01 "Hail, Druid"
War_01 "Could I get a SoW, please, oh uber druid, sir"
If he'd left of the crap at the end he'd have got his wish and buffs to
boot, but...
Druid "No, because now you are being facetious, try being polite and you
might get some help"
Casts cholo and Sup. heal on SK (wishes he had cast more just to make a
point but was in a rush)
begins casting Circle of Commons
War_01 "LOL, that would get your ass beat on my server"

Don't know where his server is but lucky for my ass I wasn't on it.

CF
<sigh> the yoof of today
