Raid leader should be setting the rules for when pets are and aren't used.  If
you are having trouble like this... I'll give you three tries to figure out a
way around it, then I'll ask you to stop.  If you can't stop, you get kicked
from the raid.  If you can't stop on subsequent raids, you get kicked from the
guild.

Just as with any class, pet casters are more than capable of not realizing the
big picture problems that their abilities can cause; since they work in a
group, surely they will work on a raid.. If they work on one raid, surely they
will work on all of them.

Its the responsibility of your raid leader (or tactical crew or whatever) to
determine when some of these things are more of a detriment than they are a
help.

Banning mass pets entirely from raids strikes me as as foolish as allowing
them on all raids; when positioning isn't such an issue, or if you can find a
way around the problem (say, wait till mob is properly positioned?)  then
adding in massive melee DPS can't really be all bad, all the time, can it?
