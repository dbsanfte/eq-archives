I don't know if I recommend pimping yourself out for resses.  I port Clerics
and Chanters for free, in turn they offer me free resses.

I *would* recommend looting in turn, and try to group with as high levels as
you can (1 1/2 times your level).  Better loot on their mobs.

At level 22 get to FM, with a good puller, you can get legchoppers, hammer
of flattening, grub picks, etc... fairly easy.  Most of that sells for
decent plat to a merchant.  There is also a chance you can win the roll on a
loop or two.

You could also offer to PL, lower level characters, but that is sort of on
the lines of pimpin' again.

Peace,
Xytrex
