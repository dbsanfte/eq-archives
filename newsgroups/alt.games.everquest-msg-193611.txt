And I'm pretty sure he didn't sit in the nexus for hours sowing everyone
that asked for it.

Wow...some people here have some issues...all I said was I don't charge
people for buff's, ress's, or whatever, sow was just an example, and I won't
pay for buff's, sue me sheesh =/ .(actually I just re-read the posts again,
most were just plain informative through the newbie bashing, bizbee on the
other hand is an assclown who can smbhb).

Also, if you read my posts properly, you would notice I said I have no
problem with the people who do this if thats how they choose to spend there
time, but I wont pay for a buff, I wont expect it for nothing.

There is also alot of assumptions, how do you know I didnt sit in Pok sowing
people? Actually, I do this, while increasing trade skills in fletching etc,
sowing and buffing people for corpse runs etc.

I also take time out to help newcomers to the game (myself only playing for
4 months or so), helping them with questions and quests etc, so please do
not make assumptions about people from a single thread in  a newsgroup,
because they dont agree with paying for buffs......

End point: I 'personally' wont pay for a buff, if someone offers one to me,
for say, me HELPING them (remember this word?), then so be it, my plat goes
on my stuff....if someone wants to sit there chanter in pok making plat off
people who want to give it to them then thats fine by me, it effects me in
no way whatsoever.

Flame bit

Oh and bizbee, you sure know how to write a lot of stuff without actually
saying anything, played mate, (ohh take a quote out of context then write a
load of shite...how clever, did you think of that all by yourself?). As I
said, you can smbhb, you're a genius, I am sure you can work that out.
