Not entirely. I have almost the same system (1800XP, Ti 500, ADSL) and
I find the "random" pauses caused by players entering have almost gone
away, but the annoying "stall" when a cluster of people in new textures
comes up is stillvery present.

I.e, going to a guild raid, everyone is already there, I port in, framerate
is fine, I run a little and turn, bringing the raid into view and theres
a hang while it "loads" the characters into memory (although the hard
disk light doesnt seem to go....). Once loaded framerate is again fine
for the rest of the session.

Extremely irritating when somebody with a particularly unusual set of
clothing, or a whole crowd of them are at the top of the katta ramp,
etc ;)
