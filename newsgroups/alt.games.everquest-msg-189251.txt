    In my experiences it doesn't take a full group, just a partner. When
charm breaks, you usually have two mobs to deal with. If a partner can delay
one from pounding the ENC, the ENC can usually control the other. That's how
it works when I partner with necromancers in CoD: charm breaks, I stun and
step forward to tank when the two stuns are finished. The NEC will mez the
other mob, then re-charm. Both classes have strategies to use when solo -
NEC feigns and re-charms once aggro clears, ENC does Word of Morell and has
six seconds to re-establish control - but they aren't as efficient as having
one other person there to help you.
