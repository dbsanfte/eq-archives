You have to target another one.  I use F8 to pick one... just keep
hitting F8 till you get one you want it to attack.

I use hotkeys to twist.  Each hotkey does a

/stopsong
/cast n

(where n is the number of the song gem you want to cast)

It helps a TON to use 3rd person perspective, imho.  Not only does it
allow you to see mobs that are behind you, but also you can target
mobs via F8 that you could not see if you were in 1st person
perspective.  Some bards do use first person, but they have to turn
around and run backwards to target things, and just haven't ever used
the 3rd person view enough to become comfortable with it.

I hit F9 four times from the 1st person mode to get to the good 3rd
person mode... or at least the one that I like for swarm kiting. 
Learn to adjust the viewing angle, distance, height, etc...  Just
stand somewhere in an open area and play with it till you get the hang
of it.  Then try running in largeish circles from that perspective
till you can do that reliably.   Then drag one mob around in a circle
till you get confused or get bored... then zone. Gradually build up
your skill in this and you wont die much at all.

And before you begin your swarm kiting session, make sure you set that
view point up first.  I've forgotten to a number of times, because I
usually start the pull in 1st person mode, and switch to 3rd once I've
round up a bunch of them.

First time you swarm kite, try rounding up just two mobs.  Charm one,
and use F8 to select the other.  Oh, and set up a hot key for "/pet
attack".  You can use F8 to select the mob you are going to charm too.
 The cool thing about F8 is that once you have a charmed mob, F8 will
never select your pet because he's no longer an NPC... he's played by
you :)

Use F1 F1 to reselect your pet before charm breaks so that you may
either recharm it, or chant kite it till it's dead.

Even better is to do F1 F1, then Tab Tab.  That way you've stored your
pet in your tab buffer.

There are also some tricks you need to learn to break invis if you
don't have a clicky invis item.  I have to switch instruments from my
drum to my flute so that I can play invis.

Swarm kiting a fun skill to learn, and I'm still working on it.  Last
night was my best pull to date... 11 blue mobs down in about 10
minutes, and took less than half a bubble of damage and that was just
during the pull, not during the kiting.
