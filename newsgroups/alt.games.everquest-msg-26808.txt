You will not evade me, StanMann <stanmann@not.there.anymore.com>:

>He's a wood-elf warrior, who managed to screw over his faction.

My main problem with him is his lack of respect for porters and for
those of us who choose to not go anonymous despite not playing taxi
all the time we're logged in, or won't port at the drop of a hat.
(Yes, it is lack of respect even if you go whine in a newsgroup rather
than tell someone to their face that you're not happy with them)

That's what this thread is about. He got his port from someone else a
while later and didn't have to worry about the option of getting a
camo and risk being bumped while on the boat - but he HAD to complain
because a camper wanted 70/50 pp to port poor lil' him, and because
said camper didn't go anon if it 'bugged him that much'.
