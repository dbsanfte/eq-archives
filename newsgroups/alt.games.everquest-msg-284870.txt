Some may have forgotten to choose as its not an obvious choice.  I had my 
looks completely set and accepted, then couldnt find "choose heritage" till 
I opened the looks section back up.  Heritage really shouldnt be in the 
looks section imo.  I could care less whether my tattoo is green or black 
color.  I just care what breath weapon I get, and whether the title 
characteristics have any meaning aside from roleplaying I still dont know. 
I'm not sure how to tell what heritage you have if you dont know.  Its not 
on the character sheet afaics.  Maybe do all the counselor quests then see 
which one gives you a breath weapon?
