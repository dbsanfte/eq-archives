Quite the opposite.  Marc attempted to use the Liberty
as a "reason" for the US to strive for poor relations
with Israel.  I provided a counterexample to illstrate
that relationships are not static.  

But I will make it simpler for you:

No.  

1) The Liberty incident does not mean that the US
should hate Israel in perpetuity and ignore all of
our other interactions and relationships, just as

2) The War of 1812 does not mean that the US should
hatt the UK in perpetuity and ignore all of our
other interactions and relationships, just as

3) the War Between the States does not mean that
the North should hate the South in perpetuity and
ignore all of our other interactions and relationships,
just as

4) the Mexican American war does not mean that
the US and Mexico should hate each other in perpetuity
and ignore all of our other interactions and relationships,
just as

5) the US invasion of Canada does not mean that 
Canada and the US should hate each other in perpetuity
and ignore all of our other interactions and relationships...

Are you beginning to see a pattern here?
