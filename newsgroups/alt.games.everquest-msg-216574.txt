Personally, I only have time for one MMORPG.  I am having fun in EQ, I am 
playing with friends.  In fact, a large part of the fun is that I am 
playing with friends.  If, most of my friends stopped playing, I would 
too.  It's not that I am rejecting EQ2, I just know that I do want to 
continue playing EQ, and, I simply don't have time for another one also.  
For that reason, I have not tried any of the other MMORPGs out there, 
regardless of whose they are.  Eventually, I am sure a day will come when 
I no longer have fun, at that point, I'll look for something new.
