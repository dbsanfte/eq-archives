100 bucks.

Doesn't depend on my RL situation nor my plat situation. EQ is a game,
and there is no winning... hell its barely competitive. Why would i
need a 'leg up' in this environment...??

IRL 100 bucks isn't going to make a whit of difference either, but it
would cover the cost of the next few expansions... or a few months
subscriptions.
