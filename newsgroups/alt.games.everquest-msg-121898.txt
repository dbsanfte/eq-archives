Eliminating LOIO eliminates some of the best XP in the game: bloodgill
goblins.  They are *way* underpowered for their level, leading to excellent
XP.  Most of them are blue up to 50, and only have about 1300 or so HP.

Have you given Emerald Jungle a try?

Maybe bind in Eastern Wastes, then do the ulthorks or giants or mammoths or
manticors (are walrus' still blue at 46?).  When those run out, instead of
waiting for them to respawn, port to Cobalt Scar and see if there are no
idiots around, and if not, grab a wyvern or two.  If the idiots are out, or
everything is taken, port to Emerald Jungle, and fight near the TT zone.
It's almost always safe to zone into TT if you get into trouble.  When you
hit a dry spell in EJ, port over to NK and grab any hill giants or griffins
that are up.  After the giants and griffs are gone, things should have
respawned in EW, so gate back.

If you can bring yourself to put up with LOIO for the bloodgills, replace EW
with LOIO in the above.

Oh, you might also add to the cycle the spectres outside the cave to the
Fear portal.  Specs are weak...only about 1700 hitpoints.  There's a single
spawn outside the cave, on something like a 5 minute timer, and often the
first one in the cave is far enough from the others to single pull, if you
can't handle two.

The above is all based on stuff my Wizard did from the high 40's onward, so
I'm not sure how well it will work for a Druid, but I don't think any of the
mobs I mentioned are ones for which Wizards do particularly well.

(If specs do turn out to be easy, take another look at Oasis...port up,
clean out the spectres, and port on to the next spot.  Zones like Oasis and
LOIO are a lot more tolerable when you are just popping in, killing 5 or 6
things, and popping out).
