This really adds very little to the immersion. Its not a bad idea, but 
its not a big deal either. I killed Uglilk, and you killed Morgrib and 
he killed Zipollik but we all know that they might as well have been 
called 'an Orc King'.

That's a fallacy. New players aren't screwed over by a dynamic world. 
The fact that an NPC who gave a quest no longer spawns, or indeed that 
the city he lived in has been exterminated and is now a haunted ruin 
entombed in caverns of ice is *not* a bad thing for newbies.

They might at worst, regret that great things have happened in the game 
that they missed... but that is balanced by the anticipation that great 
things are still to come. As long as new content is flooding into the 
game they won't be 'screwed over' by old content leaving the game. 

Indeed that is an advantage of a *subscription* based model. You pay for 
current content monthly in a living world. You don't get to play last 
months world this month. And really: you shouldn't be.

Not as much as you think. And I think people would be willing to pay for 
it. Add 1 dollar to the subscription fee, with 60,000 players, and you 
can pay a *team* of 10 writers extremely well.

With half a million players... 100+ content writers. With the right 
'engine' to work with new quests and story should be available hourly.
