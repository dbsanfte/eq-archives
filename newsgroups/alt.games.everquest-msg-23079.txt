Humm not a description of ninja looting that I have heard before.
I will bow to your superior knowledge.

For me ninja looting was when it was FFA and one player consistently got
all the loot (often before the body hit the ground).
The rest of the behaviour that you describe I would simply call damb
rude.

Ho Humm.
