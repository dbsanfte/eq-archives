Had seen the resource on monkly before but was looking for something
else and didnt regester what was all being said, very wieghty document
there. Also found some bugginess in my ui on reporting misses
corrected that and all seems as it should be. Ahhh it was something to
do.

As for off-hand seems its saying use the best ratio weapon reguardless
of delay since dual wield is proced on off-hand delay while double
attack is proced on each weapon independently. One big reason 2HB out
damages duel wield at higher levels.

Did notice one thing positive in what Ive done, when partnering with
friends druid, my monk now holds agro much better using the secondary
23 delay over the 27, lol Duh 

Thanks for your time it was entertaining and I learned something.
