This is *exactly* how I feel.  I don't mind being leader at work 40 hours a
week.  I don't mind being leader in a zone that I know like the back of my
hand.  But to be leader in a new land with a group of strangers that I know
nothing about?  Sorry, I'm just not up for the job.
But I'll join your group, so long as cliffs aren't involved....
