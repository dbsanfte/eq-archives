This is all blatently false.  Nobody wants to kill you.  In fact, to my 
knowledge, nobody has ever died since the computer came online.  Anyone 
suggesting otherwise must be a mutant traitor.  Of course such nonhuman 
scum must be cleansed.  However, this won't count as a death, since they 
were never alive in the first place.

The clones are kept purely for insurance purposes, and there is 
certainly no intention of ever using them.

Have you signed your waiver?
