As some folks know, there's a way to build hotkeys that include
item links.  The process has been posted here before and I won't
repeat it, but if you have such hotkeys here's a heads-up that
you need to rebuild them.  Apparently the "item codes" that you
need to build into the hotkeys have been changed, so the old
keys don't work.

This happened once before; I think it was when augments were
added to the game.  The item codes were changed to include a
bunch of extra 5-hex-digit chunks to represent the augs.  This
time just one new 5-digit chunk was added; I'm not sure what
it's for, but it's not always 00000.

Time to go regenerate all those links, /sigh.  The ones for the
jester-summoned bread and wine are particularly tedious to get
the info for.  (I may try just inserting 00000 for those to see
if I get lucky.)
