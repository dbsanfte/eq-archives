Having worked in Customer Service for 7 years, I can say that Kaev is very
well informed on this matter.  Being polite will get you a LONG ways with a
CSR.  Being rude, no matter how justified, will put you at the very bottom
of the list of those being helped.  I like to think that I was a very good
CSR as I was promoted to management levels and was used to implement
training on how to get a jerk to calm down and work with people.  My
techniques are still used by the company I worked for 2 years ago.  All I
can say is this, if you are coming off to the CSR (GM) the same way you
vented in here, you have little chance of getting fast/courteous service.
My advice (if you did do this) is to apologize and let him know you were
angry, but that you have had time to calm down since your original petition
and that you look forward to hearing from them in the near future.  (also,
it may not be a bad idea to tell them when you will be logged on with your
char and what your alts are.)

Just my 2 copper pieces of information.
