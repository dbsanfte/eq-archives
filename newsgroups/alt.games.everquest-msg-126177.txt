}*Never* did I say that it has no place.

Similarly, *never* did I say it had a place.  But I think it's pretty 
clear what we both implied.  It's particularly when you ask how one can 
think it's not a bad thing.

}This entire thread is about
}*toning it down* first and whether or not foul language is offensive
}second. I for one never claimed it should be eliminated. I just
}maintain that people are deluding themselves if they don't think using
}profanity is offensive. It is.

No argument there. :)

}> }Refusing to recognize this can only be seen as rude and selfish.
}> I'm sorry, I find the word "rude" offesive.  I mean, it's so -obviously- a

}Uh...no it's not, and you don't think so either. Give me a break.

Of course not, I'm just blowing smoke up your ass. (OMG! I referred to 
donkeys! (utoh, I took the good lord's initial in vain! (eek! I referred 
to vanity, which is sinful.)))

My point was that it doesn't matter how extremely careful you are to avoid 
all possible language that might possibly offend, someone out there wil 
-still- manage to be ofended by it.  So you may as well scrap the whole 
project and talk how ya talk.

}> }Does it foster ill will more often than not? Yep. Say to a passerby,
}> }"Excuse me..." Then say to the next, "Fuckin' excuse me..." Take note
}> }of the different responses you get.
}> It also seems to vary rather more with where I put the accent on the last 
}> half of te phrase.  "Erm, fuckin' excuse me" is a lot different from 
}> <Steve Martin>Well, excuuuuuse me!</Steve Martin>.
}Of course it is. I don't see your point.

Hmm.  You're right, I put it badly.  What I meant was that any might find 
the Steve Martin version more offensive than the vaguely New Yorkian 
version, despite the lack of one of the seven dirty words that'll curl 
your spine, grow hair on your hands, and keep the country from winnin' the 
war. (With apologies to George Carlin.)

So ultimately people may be offended as much by how they choose to read 
the text as by what is actually written.  Judicious use of emoticons may 
ameliorate this problem somewhat, but wil never completely eliminate it.

}> }This is a ridiculous exercise in futility. Congratulations on getting
}> }me more than a little worked up about it. Honestly, it's not my job to
}> }fix what your mother didn't do right in raising you.
}> Oh, bringin' my mother into it, now?  Now that's -really- offensive, bro.
}> You got somethin' to say, you say it to me, and leave my mother right out 
}> of it, ok?
}I am saying it to you. You brought you mother into this by championing
}a cause so derelict. You are a reflection of her efforts.

Really?  How?  For all you know, I was raised in the woods by renegade 
synthetic organisms that escaped from a lab.

}Btw, why is that offensive to you? After all, I'm not meaning to
}insult her. I'm just stating what I believe to be fact. You can't
}define why it's wrong? It must be ok then.

I can define why it's wrong.  You've called the competency of my mother 
as a child-rearer into question, which can be construed as a direct insult 
to her.  You insult my family, you insult me.  And insults, strangely 
enough, many people find offensive.

If I were to state that I believed it to be a fact that someone's mother 
was a hamster, and their father smelt of elderberries, can't you see where 
the someone in question might be offended?  And to heck with what I 
-meant-.  All they have to go on are the words I actually said.  Text 
doesn't come pre-illuminated.

Honestly, I don't care if you insult my mother, I insult her enough 
myself.  All I gotta do is grow a beard and she takes it as an insult.  
Sheesh!

But basically, this is another example of how, no matter how careful you 
try to be, you wil still manage to offend someone.  Even without using 
"foul language, profanity, cursing or obscenities." So give it up.  Pack 
it in.  Talk how ya talk.  If that's without the aforementioned 
sledgehammers, great.  If it is, also great.
