*IF* you can get a group in cazic thule, lizardscale and ravenscale
armors should fetch some cash. Also, lots and lots of fine steel drops
there. When you get a few levels under your belt, you can camp the
ancient crocodile in upper guk (I camped him and his placeholders with
ease at level 36, and got exp for almost every single crocodile) for
gatorscale sleeves and leggings. Use the leggings yourself, and sell
the sleeves to an int caster for maybe 5-800 pp.
