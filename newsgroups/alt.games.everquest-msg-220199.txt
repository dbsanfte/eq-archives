Although I know you didn't mean it this way, I find this to be the new
"rule" in EQ. I don't need to go anywhere! I have my group of 4-6, I
have my dungeon, I have a place close by to sell loot, no need to go
anywhere! I can level from 1-65 right here.

Hell, why not make bankers at the camps as well, why not new commands
for in dungeon use?

/Monk Epic and poof epic mob materializes, group kills and epic is
yours!

Am I the only one who thinks LDoN makes a farce out of the game? Maybe I
am, maybe it's time to /wave goodbye to EQ even though I still enjoy my
sessions somewhat. Normal groups are increasingly hard to find however,
so I spend a lot of time tradeskilling and farming these days. As for my
stuff, none of it is planar, none of it is from LDoN, so not worth
anything to anybody.

Where goes EQ from here? Surely it can't be trivialized any further?
