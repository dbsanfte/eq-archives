    Yeah, it pretty much was time to go to bed alright.

    But I don't think that you're totally to blame here for the mistake. 
Some of the fault has to lie with the marketing geniuses at the SoE
marketing department for conditioning you to point that your brain firmly
believes it must decline something in order to play without having to buy
an expansion you don't really want.  I mean, geez, how hard could it be to
add a "No, and don't ask me again" button?  How long had Oow been available
for purchase?  I would bet that some people have bought it just to make the
splash screen go away.

   So.  Did the splash really go away, or was it just moved to some other
part of the log in process?
