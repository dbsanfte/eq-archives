Hi gang!!

I was running around the newb zones on Stromm with my 50 cleric to temp the 
noobs.  For some reason my group temperance spell would not work in 
Crushbone.  It worked everywhere else.  When I tried to cast it in Crushbone 
I got a single "Spell did not take hold" message, not 1 for each group 
member.  The cast ate 1,650 mana and none of the groupmembers received temp. 
I ended up temping them individually after the group temp failed 3 times, so 
it wasn't a stacking issue.

Any ideas what would cause this?

Thanks!
