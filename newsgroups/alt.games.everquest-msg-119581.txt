Paludal Caverns was incredible from 19 to 26; the most insane xp I've ever
seen in EQ. I got that advice on this newsgroup. I was also told that
Netherbian Lair would be the next place to go. Went there and it's not great
at all. The xp was very slow, maybe they nerfed it. Most MOBs were light
blue to me at 25.

What other suggestions do any of you have for fast leveling from 26 to 34.
Not really that interested in loot, mainly FASTEST leveling. BTW, I'm a High
Elf Wizard.

And another thing. Anybody got any cool suggestions for a last name for a
Wizard?

Thanks for any advice.

Bropine, Level 26 High Elf Wizard
