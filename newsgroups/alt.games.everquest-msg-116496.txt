What the heck are you talking about? I know this information is incorrect...
the easiest example is Murissa Sandwhisper she is a merchant/vendor in NRO.
When I first met her, she was indifferent to me. I bought and sold items
from her. As I killed more Dervishes (the faction she is on) she began to
like me less and less. Soon she wouldn't sell to me. I wrote her off and
thought nothing more of it. Then one day as I ran by her she attacked me
killed me in just a few hits.. when I returned to get my body, I noticed she
was "scowling" at me ready to attack.

She certainly did attack me. And I've seen lots of other people attacked by
merchants elsewhere. Most often in Rivervale.
