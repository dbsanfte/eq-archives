I've been a regen based berserker for a long time.  In fact I've 
occaisionally regretted not making a zerker of a regen race, but thats 
not the topic of this post.

Rather, I've been watching for a moment to occur; the point at which the 
regen is doing so little that I might as well not bother, and go get 
some real gear for those slots instead.

So far, I haven't reached that point.

At level 56, my standing regen is 44 hp per tic.

If I take off my Fungus Patch Vest and don't activate my Fungal Regrowth 
off my staff, its more like 14 hp per tic.

Fighting dark blue mobs, there's a huge difference between the two; even 
though the mobs are hitting me for 100 or 150 points as their high end 
blows.

The only times when the regen seems pointless are when I'm the MT and I 
have a cleric in the group and either we have no slower, or the mobs are 
stun immune, or we're taking on red to me mobs.

In those cases, my regen rate is beside the point, the only thing 
keeping me afloat is heals, preferably Cheals.

With a shaman or druid healer, substituting in their better regen for my 
fungal regrowth, wearing the patch vest, makes a noticable difference in 
how well they can keep me healed.

If I'm not MT, then I tend to go for more attack value rather than 
regen, but I put the regen back on if I'm taking damage, because 
generally with that running the healers never have to patch me up, 
saving all their mana for the MT

Its possible for me to get even more regen; I can get regen AA, I can 
spend more time in LDoN and get regen augments.

But I still feel that the day is coming when I'll be better off raising 
my AC, HP, and stats than with all the regen junk I have on.

On the other hand, maybe I need to think of this the same way I think of 
my patch vest/ornate BP; have two sets of gear, one for when regen is 
appropriate, say when soloing or in healerless groups; and one for "real 
work" where the gloves are off and I'm getting smacked around upwards of 
250 a shot and the regen isn't going to do squat.

If I get regen augments and put them on my regen gear, then my "real 
work" gear will still have slots for more important augments.
