Why? I fairly recently 100k pp from my trade mule account to my normal 
main's account so I can get some ornate molds I have been saving for. Am 
I a cheat because I have a trade mule and use it as a 'savings' account? 
That 100k too me a month to make of farming pretty much every day 
mon-fri for about 5 hours, doing subcombines to make padding, tempers, 
splitting down blocks and bricks into pieces and suchlike.

I would *hope* that I would't accidently hit trade, but when I am runing 
between 2 computers in different rooms and dealing with life in general 
shit happens.

There *are* a fair number of people who regularly transfer large amounts 
of pp that are *not* buying plat you know. I would tend to think most of 
the real regulars on this usenet group are in that category - many have 
mains that are serious raiders, farmers and tradeskillers. Hell, I 
*gave* 3k pp to someone on this group on FV because I was deleting my 
characters there...was he cheating just becuse he didn't gut out some 
poor little snow bunny with his own little hands?
