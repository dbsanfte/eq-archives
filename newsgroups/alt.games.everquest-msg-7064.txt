One thing nobody has pointed out about the stunnability thing:
It's related to the size of the race. Humans have default stunnability,
Ogres are unstunnable. The other races are on a sliding scale in between.
Barbarians are slightly less stunnable than Humans, Trolls are less
stunnable still.

Either way, at the very top of the game race makes little difference. My
guild has zero ogre warriors and we get by just fine so the lack of
stunnability can't be too great a factor. Physical stats are largely
inconsequential _especially_ Strength as your equipment and buffs will cap
it out anyway (my human warrior has concentrated solely on AC and still has
230STR standard buffed, 255 with Avatar, lots of STR on Epics when I get
them). So it basically comes down to your choice from a list of very minor
pros and cons. If I were starting a new warrior from scratch I would be a
Troll for Slam, Infravision and Regen (some fights last a long time and
every HP helps ;) ). Close call with Iksar but the downsides (restricted
armour choice, idiotic run animation, no way to interrupt casters til level
55) outweighed the up (AC, regen, AC, IR, AC, Forage, AC).
