If you had read my first post, you'd realize that I said "unlimited
rolls" or something to the effect. If you don't like the name that the
generator comes up with, roll another one. I admit that the generator
comes up with fairly funky names regularly, but I think -and of course,
feel free to disagree- it's a price worth paying if it gets rid of
"Vacuum Cleaner". And if you are that bothered by my own chosen names,
it gets rid of those too, so double bonus.

/em shakes his head.

Stan, I can take a flame or ten, but for the love of god at least try to
read the post you are flaming me for. I'm talking about the RP server,
and I don't have any characters there yet, as it doesn't even exist at
the moment. If and when it comes up, and if Verant takes me up on the
suggestion of imposing generated names, I'll use it like everybody else,
and probably happier than most.

Now, if what you are saying is that the fact that I haven't used the
name generator for my own character names disqualifies me to propose its
use as a possible solution for the naming situation in the RP server,
well, say so and allow me to humbly disagree.
