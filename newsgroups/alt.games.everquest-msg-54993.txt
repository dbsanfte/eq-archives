Not being an Iksar, you're fine. The note you lost would only give you a
smidge of experience and a crappy robe which you would have soon
upgraded anyway. You should still have your newbie weapon and restocked
food, so just get out there and keep hunting things that con white/blue
and looting everything and selling it all. Save up your money and soon
you'll be able to buy a better robe than that anyway. There's a merchant
near the trainers at your guild who sell a variety of better robes for
only a few plat. (That sounds like a lot of money now, but you'll get it
saved up fast enough.) More important to save up to get all your
important spells, though, so make sure you do that first.

The place you popped up in (the unfamiliar place) is your "bind point".
That's where you will *always* respawn until you get your bind point
changed by somebody, or change it yourself when you reach level twelve
and get the spell "Bind Affinity". With that, you can also bind others
in city zones.

Good luck. Oh, and get out of Qeynos area as soon as you can. (Level 8
or so.) That place is a hell hole. Either go east to Freeport area, or
head up north to Everfrost or something. Qeynos hills sucks to hunt in
at low levels.
