Actually, if you go by the people who use  the test server as a perm
play server, a decline in the population is good. Players perceive
that as more room for them to do stuff. Someone on the test server
using it as their perm said that nothing they ever go to do is already
camped, they like that. Of course getting groups there would be hard
probably.

I also can't see any real viable reason for hiding the server numbers.
Yeah, it lets their competition see market share but they already know
market share from verant spouting its "400 k continual subscribed
customers every month" line all over the place. Knowing the numbers
are dropping can't really hurt or help them either.
