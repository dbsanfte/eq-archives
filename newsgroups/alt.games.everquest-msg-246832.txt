I am a lvl 65 bard and just started working on some AA's  Have 42 atm and
wondering what Jam Feast acually will do for a lvl 65 bard....  I know it
lets u sing songs at a higher lvl but is the cap for that lvl 65?  If I
invest some AA's in there will my chants do anymore dmg?  Can someone please
help me out a bit before I waste some precious aa's on this :)  Thanks in
advance.
