How much red wine will i need to buy to get my faction high enough so i 
can buy spells within Neriak
I have heard differing views on previous newsgroup posting that i have 
since researched via google groups and some say as many as a thousand 
bottles of wine!?!
If thats the case ill stick to paying newbies to get them or cheat and 
make a dark elf character for that purpose.
