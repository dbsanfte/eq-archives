Oh, come on, it's not that much.  Basically every 3 seconds you hit a
key twice, and every 18 seconds you click the mouse to switch
instruments, then click it again 3 seconds later to switch 'em back.
Ohhh, I guess you do have to move your mouse-hand to the arrow keys to
move yourself around, but I've found that if you've already had the
first 3 cups of coffee, you find that you even have time to take
another sip between songs.  :)
Chatting with folks in /guild, /ooc, and /tell while doing all of the
above can lead to some misunderstandings unless people are aware that
you only have 3 seconds to type each burst, and that you're not going
to be proofreading or correcting.
It's really not that much different than a warrior, or maybe just
because I played a bard first.  I seem to be hitting bash, taunt, or
sense heading every few seconds in combat anyway.

Arolpin
my typing should really be faster by now
