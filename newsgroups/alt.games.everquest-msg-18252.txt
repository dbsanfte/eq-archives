Ah, so basically you are accusing me of making a "generalization". Fair
enough. I don't believe *everyone* who is anti-twink is jealous, but I
do think they are in the vast majority. Your given reason was that it
damage the role-playing aspect of it. I'd say that's horse hockey. First
of all, as you yourself freely seem to admit, EQ ceased being an RPG
long ago. Sad but true, so I don't think twinking is further damaging
the RPG aspects of the game for the majority of new, anti-twink players.
Second, even if you *are* into the role-playing aspect, how is twinking
out of the story line? In medieval societies, don't you think there were
poor people who started out with basically nothing, while those
descended from nobility came out of the gate with the best armor/weapons
that money could buy? (My rich uncle Bardsword gave me this shiny new
Mith armor and Lammy. Aren't they pretty?) Case closed on that, really.

I see. So for *others* to make generalizations about the twink vs.
anti-twink question is obviously wrong. But, of course, when you make a
blatant generalization that "anyone who says..." then you're just
what....? Stating an obvious fact that shouldn't be in dispute? Your
dickwaving l33t theory may be true for a very small percentage of
dickheads in Norrath, but the majority are just folks who earned their
stuff with other characters and are probably spending a fair amount of
their time *helping* the newbie in leather and rusty weapons. If you
really ran into enough people like that, then I either feel bad for your
incredible run of bad luck, or I have to wonder if may you went around
acting like such a screaming asshole that people started copping an
attitude towards you. Not having played with you, obviously I can't
speculate as to which is more likely.

It's inconsistent because you are effectively building a platform of
saying that most people who oppose twinking are *not* jealous of those
who can zoom through the first ten levels, but then saying it's fine for
you to do so.

Having read both this, and your last post, I fail to see how your
statements could be interpreted in any *OTHER* fashion! You equate
"light twinking" to being a situation where you *will* learn your
character after it passes the first ten levels, and you clearly equate
the jade mace scenario as a situation where you will zoom "too far" and
*not* sufficiently learn your character, then "wisely" making the choice
to go for the "light twinking". Arguing semantics doesn't change the
tone and intent of the message one bit.

You've already stated that *you* don't care. Nor do I. But reading the
endless periodic threads on the subject here, obviously many do. And I,
along with what appears to be a vast number of people, equate the lowbie
anti-twink stance with a simple case of jealousy.  That's not an insult.
As I said, it's a VERY normal and natural reaction. If you were the poor
medieval farm boy in the previous scenario out there fighting on the
practice fields with a cracked rusty sword your dad found in the cabbage
field, wearing some hides of the cow that froze to death last winter,
you'd probably be pretty damned jealous of Lord Fancypant's son
Inglewood Fancypants III riding out to face you on his well fed war
horse wearing full plate and a shining new great sword. Doesn't make you
a bad person. Just motivates you to go earn enough fame and fortune to
get your own cool shit. And it's not "dick waving" on the part of the
twink or the endorser of twinking. Simply taking advantage of your
resources and making an observation on the often vitriolic reactions of
others. You should really be careful about making generalizations when
you are so clearly in the minority on this one.
