I don't know. Depends how long your day is. When I came back to EQ
after, I guess, a two year absence, I still remembered all the good
tricks. Some of them were reduced in effectiveness, but still most of
them were there. (I actually wrote a guide back in the day.) Fought in
everfrost until 5th level or so (as soon as the skellies were green)
then took all the bone chips I had gathered and purchaced from vendors
over to kaladim. That got me level 12 IIRC, Then took the money I got
from that plus my HQ/MQ/LQ Bearskins and spiderling silks to the
bazaar and upgraded most of the spots that didn't have newbie quest
armor on them, then headed to Crush. (Picked up some more bone chips
on every pass to the vendors near the newbie zones, and dropped them
off in kaladim when I got the chance.) Didn't hit Palududial until
about level 17, but made 20 quickly. (And just as quickly got tired of
that place.) I'd say I made level 20 in about 8 hours or so play time.
I wouldn't say any half-wit could do it, but it easy enough to do it
if you know what to focus on.
