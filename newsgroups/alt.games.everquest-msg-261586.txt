Yeah, I was ranting (c;  My biggest gripe is crap against MObs...I don't
care about what other people wanna twink.  I DO care when my char is getting
the tar beat out of him by a DB MOb and barely scratching them with my level
appropriate weapons.  It will never happen, but I'd still like to see a
little MOb balancing vs. equipment.

Cheers!
