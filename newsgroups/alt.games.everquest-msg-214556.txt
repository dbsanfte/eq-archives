Just a couple. I promise.

As long as the seven-level difference requirement is
met when the adventure is accepted, what happens after-
wards or during the adventure won't mess up a group,
will it? (I.e., a group accepts an adventure and on
the way, someone falls down a cliff, dies, loses a level
that makes them fall out side the seven-level limit,
will that stop the group from entering the dungeon?)

And what is with the Raid Recruiter? I don't remember
anyone mentioning that before. Is the Raid Recruiter
active at this time or is this something that is going
to happen sometime soon? What is the member req for a
raid?
