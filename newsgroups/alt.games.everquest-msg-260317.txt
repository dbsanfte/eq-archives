Also, verisimilitude has to give way in the face of it being
simply not fun.  I always wondered what the point of having 
a graphical representation of the world was when I spent 90%
of my time looking at my spellbook.

Also, I think they should have done away with medding in combat
(along with CH and high percentage slows) in beta.  If the
current game wasn't balanced around those things, I think it'd
be more fun (but what do I know :/ )
