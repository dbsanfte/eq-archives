Whereas it's always bad for clerics. A friend of mine was one of the
first clerics to 50 back in the day and used to tell me stories of the
harrassment he got when not anonymous. One particularly annoying fellow
would not take no for an answer, and after being put on ignore, had his
friends send tells to the cleric until he put them all on ignore. People
would expect you to run half way across the world to rez them, and still
mostly do now, except most clerics are anonymous.
