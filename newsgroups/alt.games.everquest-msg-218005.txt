I knew I was overlooking something.  But lets see.  Yes, charm
two mobs and you get the basic "melee discount" I keep coming
back to; tear up the target faster and take less damage because
of it.  Since chanters have no pet heal for their charmed pets,
though, they lose part of the equation, which is that healing
isn't any cheaper, cause its nonexistant.  On the bright side,
they can break charm on the injured one and have the strong one
finish it off.  Plus there are some funny issues with charm that
make it possible to lose massive amounts of the exp from a kill
if most of the damage is done by a single charmed pet, but with
more than one charmed pet working most of that disadvantage
dissapears.

I'd still say bards are worse off, even though bards can do the
same trick here as chanters can, because bards can do much much
better than that trick... but will have a hard time doing so with
two bards.
