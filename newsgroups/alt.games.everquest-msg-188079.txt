Someone mentioned Bloodgil Goblins in Ill Omen.  They have very low HP for
their level, and are great XP, although not as good as they used to be when
Ill Omen had a high ZEM.

Spectres might be worth considering.  The ones in Oasis and the ones near
the Fear portal are level 33-37, and have something like 1700-1800 HP.
There's a single spawn outside the Fear cave that is something like every 5
minutes 15 seconds.  You can use that to see if you have any problems with
them, and then try the ones in the cave.  Sometimes you can get a single
from the front area of the cave, sometimes you get two.  I have no idea if a
level 45 Beastlord would have trouble with two or not.

If you aren't in a hurry, you can just do the single.  ALT-TAB out and
browse the web or read usenet or something between spawns.

If you want to practice multiple Spectres in a more open setting, there are
the ones in Oasis.  If you do those, and decide you can't handle them, and
zone, be sure to shout to the zone that you are doing so, because the
Spectres path by some areas that people like to hang out on their way back
to the island.

If you go through the Fear cave, there's an NPC Necro that hangs out near
the Fear portal.  She's level 40, and pretty weak for her level, and is a
fairly fast respawn.  Just be sure if you hunt there that if you get in
trouble when you've reached level 47, you can surpress your zoning urge.
Zoning into the Plane of Fear to get away from a Spectre add is generally
not recommended. :-)

If you are in the mood for endless fields of white, occasionally obscured by
snow, consider Eastern Wastes.  Walruses are in the high 30's to low 40's
range, and don't have a lot of HP.  There's a whole bunch of them in the
Southwest part of the zone.  I didn't start doing much in EW until 52, but
there was a lot of green stuff that was high greens, so at 45, EW would be
full of blues.  Watch out for the Manticores.  Those things have a ton of HP
for their level.

Now would be a good time to start working on whatever helps either your CoV
or Kael faction.  E.g., if you plan to be friendly to CoV, start hunting in
Kael.

I think there might be stuff in The Hole that you could do with a small
group.  The Hole has a large ZEM.
