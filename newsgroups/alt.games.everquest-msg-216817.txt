They dont only scale missions they scale rewards too.  There seems to be lvl
60 loot , lvl 63 loot , lvl 65 loot all available on the tables for lvl 65
characters. On hard even more weird stuff happens and it matters whether you
are in a scrug group or a very solid elemental group which type you get.  I
know they playing with it just havent figured out how yet. Bet we pay a real
penalty for some of our guildmates that have 400+ aa and are buying stupid
crap with them now, or maybe not if the twinkie loot drops are better as
well.
