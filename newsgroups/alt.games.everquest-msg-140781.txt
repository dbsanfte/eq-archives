/Rant, pt.1: an introduction.

Ok, ok, I know the subject is a bit trollish but it's intent is more aimed
at sarcasm than fact.  I have, however noticed in DL the amount of monks
that just run up to mobs and smack them without first seeing if they are
already engaged.  Of course it's not all of them, just quite a few.
My main is a Bard and I don't enjoy getting hit, so instead of running up
and popping the mob I set it up with chains and dots.  Simple stuff.
Whether I'm soloing or grouping and pulling I use the same method, except I
save slow until it's close to the group.

/Rant, pt.2: The Bile rises to meet the tongue.

However...I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've been walking
backwards, right in front of the mob, even *facing* it, the thing is at
crawl-speed and lit up like a Christmas tree from my songs, and yet a monk
will come along and start whacking it!  Then sometimes I get accused of
being the KS'ers???  Sometimes this leads to some ugliness....

/Rant, pt.3: Fear and Loathing in DL.

Last night I had a mob that was *obviously* damaged and slowed and kiting it
toward my druid partner (never overlook the bard/druid or bard/wiz combo!),
when a monk comes and smacks it right in front of me.  It keeps following me
and he smacks it again.  "Screw him", I thought.  This was like the 5th or
6th time he'd tried to take a mob away.  Since DL was a bit crowded I had to
long-distance pull, so between 3 dots the mobs were obviously damaged.  He
tried to take this one Drolvarg from me like 8 times before I finally got
the thing to my partner, and he starts sending me /tells threatening to
/report me.  BAH!  He was pissy at first, but after a little exchange of
words he suddenly ran off and didn't bother another one of my mobs.

/Rant, pt.4: GM gets involved.

This morning in DL it got pretty ugly.  Soloing a bit to try to hit 50, I
pull a Drolvarg.  It's not even crowded this morning (only 18 players) and
this Monk *still* must take my mob.  He hit it 3 times and it still doesn't
even shake from me.  That should show how pissed it was at me already.  Monk
runs away.  The rest comes from my log...

Monk tells you "Don't EVER do that again!"
You tell Monk "Hey, I had that thing slowed already."
Monk says in /ooc "Bard is KSer!!!  Where's a GM when you need one?"
You say in /ooc "I had slowed that thing already before you even hit it!"
Monk says in /ooc "Ah, that's an old Bard trick.  Everyone knows that."

(All bards KS and claim we slowed it??)

You say in /ooc "Mobs don't come already damaged."
Monk says in /ooc "BARDS CAN'T HIT SHIT!!!"
You say in /ooc "Thank you, Shakespeare.  Ever heard of dots?"

Then he shut up.  I soon found out why...

GM tells you "If you have any more problems with Monk, let me know."
You tell GM "Thanks!  I wasn't ks'ing really.  He tried to take it, I kept
it and he wigged out."
GM tells you "Lol, don't worry.  Just let me know if it continues"
You tell GM "Thanks again.  Your job should get easier in a couple weeks
when they all go back to school."
GM tells you "Lol, I hope so"

Unsolicited help!  And it worked in my favor!  The monk apologized in /tell.
All was good.
And I dinged 50!!

/Rant, pt.5: reprise.

I realize DL and some other zones get pretty crowded.  Many times when a mob
gets taken (and that is quite often) I will just let them go.  There's
plenty of mobs in DL, lag can be odd, and mistakes *do* happen.  This I can
live with.  However when one person seems to make a point of hit-and-run
pulling without looking around it bugs me.  And these are the first ones to
accuse of KSing it seems.

*sigh*...I feel better now!

Safe travels all,
SEAN...
