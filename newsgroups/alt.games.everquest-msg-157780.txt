Level of character, you should say.  She's mid-30s, her guild's raiding
is done in places like Mistmoore and LGuk.  Just give her some time,
one of her two "mains" is a Rogue, if she keeps playing she's rather
likely to be invited into the world of high-level raiding, judging by
the relative rarity of higher level Rogues if nothing else.
