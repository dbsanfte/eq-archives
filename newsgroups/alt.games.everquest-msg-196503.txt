They "could" have been replaced but weren't.  The thing I'm seeing more of,
is people playing what they like rather than what would be needed.  I think
the game recently has evolved to a certain class having an advantage in a
certain area, but many others now a close second so the class distinctions
are a little more blurred.  Is this good or bad?  Really hard to say.
