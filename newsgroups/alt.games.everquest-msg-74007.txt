Sleepers is different.
It's the annoying bullshit key restriction that forces people to do
this.

The ST key is not soul bound.  Which means if you die inside and are
unable to do a rez inside, you kiss your corpse goodbye.

The idea is to have your equipped self inside while having your key
outside (so you can at the very least zone in and get your corpse
summoned).

There's varying ways to do this but generally you don't need to make a
corpse outside:

1.  Zone in.
2.  Make corpse.
3.  Get revived back.
4.  Loot ST key.
5.  Get TLed to bind point (or just die again)...NOTE:  Bind near a
bank.  Bank ST key.
6.  Get revived back again.

Viola!  You're in ST and your key is in your bank.

Making corpses outside isn't neccessary unless a bunch of them weren't
bound near a bank or they wanted to make corpses near the zone in with
their ST keys on them.
