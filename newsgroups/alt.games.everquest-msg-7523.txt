I accumulated silks in Everfrost, killing the spiders that roam around the
east side of the zone by the Permafrost entrance.  There was no competition. 
I wasn't intending to gather silks, I was waiting for the icy orcs camp, but
it was a desirable side effect.

Then I discovered the silk motherlode.  Check the DE merchants in South Ro. 
People lay waste to the zone to get the AC to spawn, and will sell all the
mob loot.  I've pulled 40 silks out of them before, and that was before I
knew about the merchant-diving technique to get stuff that was off the
bottom of the inventory list.
