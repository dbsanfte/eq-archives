Places i seen it drop:
WW Dragons (got mine there)

ToV HoT


Its not something you just go try and farm with 1 group, but if youre in 
a guild able to do dragons or tov, do NOT buy the spell.
You can say a lot about the bear pet, but looking cute are not worth 
2-4K. Hes horribly ineffective, and can get killed almost everywhere.

Situations i used my cute bear pet in:

Getting faction by clearing the orc camp in Nek:
Pet great here, level 5 mobs or so, just point and them and hell go run 
amok in the camp.

Farming Excellent Sabertooth Tiger Hides in Illomen mill area:
Bad idea, full buffed pet with skin, Ds, regen, and all buffs possible 
to throw ad him by 55 druid managed to get himself killed at the mill. 
You know, the place where the level 18s hunt.

Farming elementals in lavastorm:
Bad idea. Pet run around, jump in lava, spend 30 sec to try and run up, 
then poof. I go on and find an elemental to kill, and root it. 3 sec 
later my pet show up from nowhere after being AWOL down in a lava pit, 
break my root and then die due to him being at 5% from the lava.

Farming acrylia in Tenebrous Mountains griming caves:
In theory it works, but due to SOOO bad pathing i never really got him 
to hit anything, after spending 5 min to get him to walk down the last 
part of the tunnel to the room with loads of grimlins and him repeadetly 
managing to run the wrong way, or run into walls, i stopped trying to 
use him.

Farming silks from FV spiders:
In theory working. Those guys are level 30 or so, so should be around 
even con for my pet. With full round of 55 druid buffs, he only needed 1 
heal during the fight. Then he run off in the middle of a fight (im 
getting the hits and meeleeing the spiders, so he can get free shots in, 
work better than letting him take the hits), and suddently appear with 3 
more spiders, and after he go down, im almost killed when my wolf form 
run out. Manage to get to safety of the FV guards with 100 hp left.


So cant really reccomend using him for anything but having a cute 
looking bear pet. Not worth the money if you have to buy it.
