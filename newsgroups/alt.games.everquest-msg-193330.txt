Amen. The most I ever seen anyone charging for a language is 500pp.

Btw, you can apparently learn languages from tells. Didn't know that was
possible, but someone sent me a tell in the Bazaar a few days ago and they
were speaking in Barbarian (which I only had 1 pt in). I gained a point.

I want to learn Dwarvish (there are a bunch of Dwarves in my guild), Gnoll,
Lizardman and Elder Dragon, but spending 500pp to learn each language isn't
worth it to me.

And iirc, there are some books meant for Magicians that are written in
Dragon and\or Elder Dragon. I think they're books on spell research or
something.....
