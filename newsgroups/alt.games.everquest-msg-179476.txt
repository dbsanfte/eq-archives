I don't know. I've been downloading LoY files about every other day
since pre-ordering. If this goes as it looks, there may be next to
nothing to download come "go live" time. Whip me with a noodle for
saying it, but if this is correct, they may have actually implemented
this intelligently and the LoY download purchasers may be right back
online playing with no downtime greater than a normal patch day.
