Looked up the formulas, and, the semi general consensus is that the 
formula you provided is valid for trivials >68, which would mean that 
they are ones that should not have been affected by the change which made 
very trivial (200 points trivial) items fail less than 5%.  Here are both 
formulas from eqtraders:

Success = Skill - 0.75*Trivial + 51.5 (rounded up, for Trivial>= 68) 
Success = Skill - Trivial + 66 (for Trivial < 68) 

These give the percent chance of a successful combine.  Also keep in mind 
for other than extremely trivial combines, there is a maximum 95% success 
rate, and, in theory, a minimum 5% success rate.
