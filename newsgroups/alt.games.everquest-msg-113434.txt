Dang chitin BP ruined life for everyone.

Actually I think every toon I have played has been asked for SoW.

I WE rogue I played long ago on fennin used to dress up in druid garb and
hang out at gates.
Wait for the twit rude moron SoW me now demand.
Then either take a donation and cast from the water stone and say sorry you
can't get a SoW.
or say sure but need to /donate /declare request for SoW. etc
depending on the con.
nice request went with sorry rogue reply.

Those were the days of wandering into EC /occ I know how to start some games
/gems and /quork. But how do I get /pinball to work ?

It worked for those kick the cat days. I know I know I have mellowed.
