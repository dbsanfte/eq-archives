Howdy all

I Tried this quest TWICE last night (level 7 ranger here)

delivered note to Guard captain, was told to protect Ambassador Gash,
Gash tells me about burned bark to collect from Assasin...
we Slay the assasin whose name is Raffel Minmorn and *POOF!*  He
dissappears!  
I tried the whole long drawn out thing twice and the assassin just
vanished when slain,  couln't collect the bark from him.

He dosn't materialize unless you go on a previous quest to collect the
aforementioned note.

You  are supposed to deliver the bark to another NPC in another zone 

What is happening?   anyone know?
