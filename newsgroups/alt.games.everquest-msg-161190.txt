This may be overly simplistic, but I always log onto Xegony. Once in a
great while, I will log in and find my characters gone. Then I will
look and see that I am set for a different server. I return to Xegony,
and there they are.
Still, that first heart attack at seeing no characters will really
wake you up.
Again, I may be way off track, but you should check that you have
chosen the right server.
