Well you got what was said on the box, it said 16 new zones thats what you
got.  Mad that they didn't add more then why did you get it?  You got the
new zones, weapons, etc plus 2 free games (and remember you paid $20 for
SoV, and got those two with it), be happy with it.
And you keep stating how you wish they added more zones, tell me have you
been to every zone from the old EQ, RoK and now SoV?  Somehow I doubt it.  I
know friends thats been playing for over a year have characters over lvl 50
and they say they haven't been to about 50% of RoK and I know they haven't
been to all in EQ and RoK.  So be happy that you got 16 new zones, plus two
free games for $20.00
