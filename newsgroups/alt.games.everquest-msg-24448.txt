Since the introduction of Duck as an instant cancel,
I"ve been trying to train myself to do this instead
of sit, since the act of ducking doesn't aggro.

However, I still sometimes slip... and I get a message
telling me I can't do this while casting!  I hadn't
thought about it till now for some reason, but it
seems to me this change actually has taken place,
I -swear- I used to use sit as my stop cast, and
I'm also pretty sure it is no longer working as such.

This is annoying, since there are plenty of times when
I'm really just going to sit if I've decided not to finish
a spell I started... I can't build a hotkey to

/duck
/sit on

because the reason I have the SIT pulled off my
Main bank into slot two on -every- hotkey bank
is because it changes its name to STAND if I'm sitting
and SIT if I'm standing... particularly in wolf form,
I often can't tell visually!

What possible reasoning could have taken place
in deciding that while Duck would stop a spell
instantly as Sit used to (a clear improvement over
the Sit method) that Sit would now not work?
