Uh I dunno about your map but mine only showed you where the portals
and library were.  It gave absolutely no clue as to who was were in
other places.  Sure you *can* go from building to building to look,
but quite a few in my guild have suddenly said "uh oh - I'm lost"
while wandering around PoK for the first or fifth time, map in hand.
