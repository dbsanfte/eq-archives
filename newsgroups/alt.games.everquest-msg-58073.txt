I actually think it works better this way.   Leave the pet rooted to the
spot, move to your new camp, then Summon Companian to instantly bring your
pet to you, minus the trains and other such goodies they can otherwise bring
you.

One thing to be aware of though (not sure if this is fixed yet) you have to
give your pet a new command after you summon it, or it just heads back to
the original spot it was told to guard
