Because having them off it was doing more damage to us than them. ><

Sure, it's not like he didn't send hundreds of our troops to their
deaths based on an outright lie (No, you can't convince me he didn't
know the information was false. If he didn't, and knowing that those
who gave it to him did, people would have been FIRED the instant he
found out), thousands more to be wounded in varying degrees, pissing
off the UN by telling them to go fuck themselves basically, and
spending BILLIONS of tax dollars DURING A FUCKING MAJOR RECESSION.

Oh, wait, that was Dubya.
