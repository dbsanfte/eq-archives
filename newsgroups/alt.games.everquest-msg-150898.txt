    It's a "size of window" thing, combined with how poorly EQ handles
motion. If you play a first person shooter, and watch closely, your point of
view raises and lowers as you move forward to simulate the head raising and
lowering when walking. EQ is like Wolfenstein 3D - no up-and-down, and that
makes me queasy. Especially when it takes up my entire screen and I can't
look at my hotkeys or something else while I travel.

    This might surprise you, but I don't consider it my job to learn how to
customize the interface so it doesn't make me ill. I'm not attached enough
to EQ to put in that kind of effort just to be able to play.
