Good lord yes, I'd forgotten this in my list of how to move around, but both
my cleric and later my bard used this method a -lot-, zone in to TD, swim (or
bard fly with selos up) to the Firepots room, and go anywhere.  Later they
let us bind in TD again and my cleric did that numerous times; gate to
firepots and from there to most every city in the game!  POK is just a more
advanced version of this, with a reciprocal book going there from the
destinations.

Cleric got 200 swim fairly early just swimming to firepots, and bard got
great enjoyment out of how fast he could make the trip; LOOONG runs are where
a bard really gets use out of his "ludicrous speed" mode
