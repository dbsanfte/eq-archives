The entrance to Mischief is located in North Temple of Veeshan, and requires
a seriously heavy-duty raid force just to get to it.  Once you're inside, a
single group is fine.

Killing in PoG will hit your faction with certain guilds in Kelethin and
Felwithe.  The entrance is located in Wakening Lands, at the top of that big
tower in the lake.  Never hunted there myself, but from what I hear, I think
you'd need more than one group.  If nobody is an evil race/class, you should
be able to zone in and look around, nothing will attack you.

If you really want to see a plane, my advice would be to ignore the
rotation, get a third and fourth group, and head up to Hate.
