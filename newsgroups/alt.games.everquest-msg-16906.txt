I just went to Crystal Caverns the other day because I wanted to get some
silk for MR armor.  It was me, L31 Chanter, and a L27 Druid buddy.  I looked
up the dungeon and it said mobs down to L25, so I thought it might be worth
it to check out.

Everything conned red at L31.  The /who was me, the druid, 2 rogues, an SK,
and one Anon.

I plan on going back at L34/35.  I hope I won't need to drag along a whole
crew just to get some silk to get some armour made.
