First off, I find that a despicable method of getting items or plat for your
character.  Second, if any newbie tells me he/she lost gear on a corpse that
rotted is going to get laughed at.  If you're under level 10 you didn't lose
anything and you're lying.  If you're over level 10, you're not a newbie in
my book and you should've known better. Oh, and get your own freakin' rusty
weapon out in the newbie areas...I think you can PROBABLY defeat a decaying
skellie even when naked at level 10.  :-P

Knowing that people fake their 'newbieness' makes want to avoid helping
anybody except my friends and companions.
