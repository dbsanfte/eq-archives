Hehe, my monk camped bloodgills from 48 to 51 and 6 AA (i know, im 
wierd, but wanted those AA points), and on that spawn, people were VERY 
good at respecting camp, if someone were camping them, noone stole, but 
just asked if they could get a tell when i were done.

Only one who tried to move in on me that time were a druid who wanted to 
quad them. He also use the "theres no camps in EQ" thing, and it might 
be true to VI, but on a server basis, almost everyone respect it.
And he quickly gave up after he found out that there werent any free 
mobs to quad when the max amouth of mobs up at a time were 2 (could 
clear all 12 and have a few min left before respawns). Fun part was when 
he then accused me of stealing his bloodgills (not taking anyone he had 
engaged, but being there 4+ hours i knew exactly where and when the 
respawns were, so able to engang before he could even get near them, yet 
alone cast spells.
