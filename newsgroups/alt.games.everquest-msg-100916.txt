Interesting. *My* habit developed over the years has been to prefix
*everything* with /<channel short>, and I've never used default channels
because they werent particularly intuitive and I generally have a billion
tells, group messages and guild chats going on at once.

Kinda gossipy ;)

Anyway, its instinctive for me to auto-select the channel and be typing
the message as I think about it; certainly no pause for active consideration,
just in the same way as you instinctively turn your head to face the person
you're talking to in RL. 

Bonus for me: I'm also less prone to those embaressing "oops I just cybered
in guild chat" moments the default channel afficionados like to succumb to ;)
