Warrior any day for me.. if im in PoP and the choices of tank are me, a
Paladin or SK..  hi Im tank.

EB was a nice fix for warriors, albeit late on in the game..  most of my
guildies warrs wield 2 EB weapons (bloodfrenzy and boc/hategiver)

When I use a charmed pet in tier 3, I can tash and slow within the first 2
seconds anyway, and the mob doesn't even turn and look at the
chanter/shaman.. so agro from the debuffers is not really an issue anyway
