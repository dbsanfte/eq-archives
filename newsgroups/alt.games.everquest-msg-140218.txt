I just checked this out on a few characters.  At 200 Sense Heading, it is
perfect, basically just like the DAoC compass, for those of you who have
seen that.

At 55 Sense Heading, the compass display is jiggling around at random up to
approximately 90 degrees off, so you have to watch it for maybe 5 to 10
seconds to get a good idea of your heading.

At 30 Sense Heading, it was jiggling quite a bit more.

At 4 Sense Heading, it was jiggling up to 180 degrees, and it took a
considerably longer time to figure out where I was heading.
