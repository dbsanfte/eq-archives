The seafury cyclops in OOT regularly attack the boat passengers and wipe
them out. I spent a lot of time there hunting the gargoyles and had it
happen to me once and heard the shouts of anquish of others being attacked
many times. Mostly happens when someone trains the clops to Sister Isle or
out into the path of the boat. It happens with enough frequency that I now
always invis before stepping onto the boat and am prepared to jump off and
gate at any time.
So that blows the invis/hide theory of why folks blink in and out of view on
boats. It appears to be a bug, not any form of protection.
