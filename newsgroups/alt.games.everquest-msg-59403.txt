Cheap weight reduction is to sell off your junk and drop some of those
bags in the bank.  As a druid, you shouldn't have to worry much about
weight, your armor is relatively light, after all.  What is weighting you
down?  Loot, which would be reduced in weight by a reduction bag..
and the hidden mass, the bags themselves.  Backpacks weigh 3 lbs each,
carry 8 and you are looking at 24 lbs of weight -empty-!

As a druid, you have less call to be concerned about weight than anyone
out there, if you are looting and it starts to drag you down, just ring to
your best selling zone (Surefall is looking great to me so far, but your
milage may vary) and dump your vendor sellables, convert to gems
if necessary to get rid of the non plat (I know, with low charisma you
lose money on this, but not as much as you will hitting the Destroy
for it) then gate back to your hunting grounds.  In fact, you should be
ready to do the same thing for people you are grouped with, pre-port
level its one of the nicest little bonus services you can provide, and will
help cement your relationships with those people for later when you
are actively looking for dungeon groups to go after real valuable loot.

Once you get Ring of Misty, you have your best access to a bank,
and can really afford to blow off weight reduction; what you need
are the ten slot bags to stuff your bank spaces with!
