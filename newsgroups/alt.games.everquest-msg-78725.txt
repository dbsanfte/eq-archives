But that's sort of my point.  I have done the clicking I know how hard
it is.  I have a 180 jeweler, a 160 smith, a 140 baker, a 140 tailor
plus other chars of lesser skill, many of these skilled up in the old
days of crafting where there was even more clicks required than today. 
If it was easy it would mean  nothing, everyone would max all crafts. 
So either you have a system like EQ does or one like DaoC does.  If you
use the easy method then either you have to use a major time delay or
again, everyone does crafts and they have no meaning.  EQ skills weren't
meant to be mastered in a day, I think they expected folks to spread the
clicking out over the course of the chars lifetime rather than just
clicking till your hand falls off.
