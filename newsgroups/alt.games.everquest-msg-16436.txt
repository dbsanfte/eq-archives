That's all it is is a rumor. I've nuked 'em to death and gotten plenty
of GLS's.

>The greater only sell for 2 to 3pp at stores, but can often be sold to other players for 7-8pp. This is because of a quest in NK which will yield exp and an item worth 9pp.

The Concordance of Research will sell back to merchants for anywhere
from 7-9pp, depending on charisma.

>I'm sure you guys can come up with a lot more. But please only feasable for "normal" characters. Not a cha-maxed lvl 1 HIE enchanter and Baking. Although the skill might be profitable even for normal players so I might include it anyway :) Another good one would be the Gnoll Fangs from BB but I don't know the specifics for that quest right now.

Bears. HQ bear skins will sell to players for anywhere from 25-35pp
depending on server.
