He knew that the ZEM was a modifier to the experience recieved in a zone, 
and that different zones had different ZEMs.  He did not know the formula 
used, or the units that the ZEM is in.  So, it could certainly be argued 
that he was not "fully aware" of what ZEM is, he certainly did at least 
have a clue about it.
