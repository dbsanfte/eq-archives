    I didn't take your advice John.  I trusted someone I have a lot of
trust and respect for to move my characters over to the PoK from where
they we're stuck.  I won't name him in case he would rather he wouldn't,
but will gladly confirm it if he chooses to give his name.  Anyways,
from the character selection screen I could see that our characters were
exactly where he said he took them.  All in the PoK (where none had been
before.)  

  And yet, we still cannot enter.  I give up.  SOE is going to have to
fix this, because I just ran out of ideas.
