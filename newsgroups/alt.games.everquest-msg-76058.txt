I'm in that stupid mood where I have just got to add my 2 cents worth,
knowing full well I shouldn't even bother.

but hey, I'm waiting for the patch to download, since I messed up something
else.

Not always true.    Performance can be a overriding factor, especially if
you know that the initail size requirments and scalability needs.

However, its a good rule of thumb, because we all know that things are like
gases (given a chance, they expand).

No idea how big the EQ db is.   anyone actually have an idea?   but I can't
image it is a really big one (probably big for anyone who thinks access
databases are cool).

EQ's database however is probably very far from static (as in schema
changes, not data changes), so that would have a significant impact on the
maintenance.  (a static schema is easy to maintain).

Whoa, normalization.  that fun thing that trades theory off with real world
perfomance issue.

And I've seen lots of databases that start of nicely normalised in design
time, a bit denormalised after coding has been done (damn those programmers,
don't they understand database theory 101?).  and give that database a year
or so with functiolity changes every so often, and it starts to look messy.

being dumb here.  whats AA?   (: slaps head in future)

can't make any other useful comment.   it's true, they have, and do, add
stuff that probably requires schema changes.

cool, does EQ actually use the 4 CPU's in your machine?  /smile

sorry, without any idea what the schema is, relationships between tables,
rules, triggers, data access patterns, etc  that means nothing.

Concurrency issues aside I could do it in flat text files.

that, and performance, are the big issues however.  you can't just dismiss
them.

unrelated.  why always Iskars and DE's?
