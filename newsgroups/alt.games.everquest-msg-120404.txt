How were they broken?  I'm afraid I've never been a big focus user,
too lazy to swap out my carefully gathered gear over these trinkets, even
when they might be useful most of the time.  I don't even know what
the earrings were supposed to be doing, much less that they either
weren't doing it, or that they were doing it too well

Hmm, hope thats a good thing.  Please don't tell me they added
the "more aggro" effect to anything I wear!

This doesn't sound good!  OK actually it does sound good, I'd love to
see more "intelligence" in the artificial intelligence.  But the game is has
been balanced around the artificial stupidity currently in place, this means
a new balance point may have to be reached.

Happy news for smiths... and heck, maybe I'll take the art up again, got
my first cleric to 189 skill, then my second up to 150 or so before giving
it up as a lost cause, fail rate so much higher on a Dorf than on a Pale.

Two of the most massive changes I've ever seen implemented in EQ.  Necros,
Mages, Enchanters suddenly get a big boost in power and desireability at
the higher end of the game, where they have previously been restricted from
casting their pets in 50% of groups and 75% of raids.   Enchanters from the
low levels up in particular have cause to rejoice with their pets no longer a
distinct -dis-advantage.

That cuts the "afk exp camp" ability in half... but was that really "playing"
the
game anyway?

Thats a big boost to pet classes, too big to my thinking.  Formerly they had
reason to group, since they were either going to be working hard to outdamage
pet or were splitting the exp anyway and might as well have a partner to speed
the kills rate up.  Now they need only land a single nuke (heck, their level one

"costs almost no mana" one should do it) in order to get full exp?

Why make pet classes more desireable for groups and simultaneously make them
desire groups less?

Why should a dire charmed pet be different than any other?  Mage, Necro,
and summoned Chanter pets don't ever turn on their masters, whats so
differenent about a charmed one that doesn't?  If anything there should be
a -lessened- exp penalty for the non-dire charmed pets.... but they've already
pretty much killed the exp penalty for pets anyway

My bard appreciates this change I can assure you.

This will be handy too.

Do people really use reclaim energy?   I suppose it becomes more worthwhile
at higher levels, never made sense to my mage up thru 28, as far as I ran him.

I never had this problem, and my cleric turns DS off and on a -lot- since
getting
Mark of Karn.  In zones free of DS mobs I turn it off so I don't have to see the

DS spam from my own party, in DS zones I turn it on so I can tell which mobs
need their DS removed... or just as often as a reminder of the mob I missed
MoK-ing somehow, since thats usually a "cast on every mob" spell unless the mobs

are complete pushovers.

Horses.  I know one person with a horse.  One.  And I see him on it at guild
meetings.
Thats about it.  Are they popular on other servers?  Its a rare sight indeed to
see
a horse on Morell Thule

Amusing how many horse related bugs there are I never heard of, doubtless the
lack of horse using friends and acquaintances at work.
