'EverQuest' logs Gordon
Sony hires writer for videogame adaptation

By TATIANA SIEGEL, MARC GRASER

Sony is moving forward with plans to turn its wildly popular online
role-playing game "EverQuest" into a feature, tapping "300" scribe
Michael Gordon to pen the adaptation.

Former Marvel Studios topper Avi Arad will produce the pic for
Columbia Pictures.

Bigscreen version of the massively popular multiplayer game has been
in development for several years, but Gordon is the first scribe to
take a crack at the material.
