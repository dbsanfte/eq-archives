Just wanted to kill ice giants without fear of that halas guard who roams
and his pet bear.

I heard ennchanters will be able to cast illusions on others. Maybe i can
hire some guy to make me a barbarian for a day! (*g*)

I've tried handing things in while feigned; they seem to have stopped that

about getting pounded.
