Not maybe, is.
Level 66 mobs in PoP hit roughly for about 1000 per hit (well, all
yellow cons do anyways--red cons generally hit for more).  At level
60, fully buffed, even with the best armor from Luclin/Velious, you're
gonna have a helluva time breaking 8000hps.  Against deep red cons,
that 8000hps is gonna poof real fast.

Veksar mobs are not PoP mobs.
There's a good reason why PoP zones have stupidly high exp modifiers.

And I've been in groups where chain stunning paladins easily saved the
group by giving the enchanter/shaman time to slow the mob.  Once
slowed, even a freaking monk can tank most tier two trash mobs (no, I
can't tank a level 66 mob, they just hit too damn hard and stonestance
only lasts so long).
