As Dennis stated, you will have to be an Outrider or higher to do the quest. If
you attempt to complete the quest being a ranger that is less then 55, you will
not get the rewards. This of course will not stop you from collecting the 4 heads
prior to level 55. You will be able to loot the 4 heads prior to reaching level
55 and just hold on to them until the day you turn 55.

You should also not that not only will you have to be level 55 to complete the
quest, you have to be of the Tunare faith to complete the quest.

Ranger, 58 summers
