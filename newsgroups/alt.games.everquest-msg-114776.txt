I wouldn't rule it out. It's a good zone for early teen soloing. You
just have to get used to switching back and forth between camera
angles so you can watch your back. :) Other than that, there is a LOT
of blue stuff there for a 13.

Welcome to xp grinding. It's not for everyone. I don't much care for
it either.

I think you got a decent price on it. My 20 war uses one right now to
work his til-now-neglected-2hs skill up. Not sure how the damage is
calculated compared to the 1hs weapons though. There *is* the matter
of the damage cap to consider though.

As a pally, I would keep *all* weapon skills maxxed if at all
possible. My warrior carries a couple 1hs, a 2hs, a spear and a shield
to switch between as they max out for each level.

The statue at Firona Vie is nice. Also, the boat to Firona Vie (from
BB) is really cool - much larger with neat wing-looking retracting
sails. I've only scratched the surface of all the sights to see, but I
intend to check the zone lists and start travelling according to my
level at the least.
