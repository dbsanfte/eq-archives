Well, I think this is one of those situations where it shouldn't *have*
to be stated that recruiting people out of the guild is something
frowned upon but sounds like it's a good idea to now have it stated.
Maybe an addition to your guild rules stating something along the
lines of 'If you wish to have your main leave the guild and join a
new one, your lower level alts are welcome to remain in the guild
as long as you do not actively recruit others for your new guild.'

The problem with this is that it's difficult to prove. For instance,
we have one member who left our family guild last year to join a
Time-capable guild and who is still consistantly in the guild's
chat channel. He never has actively recruited anyone from our
guild but it has been an occasional worry in the officer corps
that his linking of items that drop on their raids will lure
people out of the guild. OTOH, we also realize that if a person
is going to become interested in becoming a raiding guild member,
they're going to become interested whether someone is linking
items in the guild channel or not. (As a sidenote, we did have
one person who began pursuing being accepted into his guild, but
when it was found out that that person was still participating in
our guild events, asking for guild help in quests, and actively
denying that they had any intention of leaving the guild, their
application was turned down by the other guild.)

We have a guild policy that we only talk to people about joining
our guild if they are unguilded and, if we know that a person was
formally guilded, we try to find out why they left their former
guild.

Didn't really answer your question, did it? :P Would probably have
handled it the same, deguilded the alts and most likely had a dis-
cussion on the forums about it and added it to charter of guild.
