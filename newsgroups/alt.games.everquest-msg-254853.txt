While your arguements mostly hold water, this last one doesn't; the 
cheapest horse runs around 8kpp, not 70Kpp, and has the same 
meditation/sit aggro benefits as the highest priced one.

My 65 cleric owns a cheap horse, my 65 mage and my 52 shaman own cheap 
drogmars, and none of us could be happier; in some situations that horse 
adds up to the equivalent of 20FT (places where I simply never get to 
sit at all, either due to sit aggro or because I'm chain casting), and I 
couldn't be happier with it.  But I wouldn't pay a single pp over the 
minimum for the "better" mounts, which are better only insofar as they 
let you move around faster.  My mage has actually been able to test this 
out, because he's on the FV server where bridles and drums aren't "no 
drop", and has experimented with mounts up to the 50kpp range; movement 
on one still sucks.  Run 3 is all you ever need anyway, unless you're 
hunting snow griffins or something like that which runs faster than SOW.

My berserker has no interest in a mount whatsoever, with no spells to 
mem, no mana to regen, and actually making use of sit hp regen
