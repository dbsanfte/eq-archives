Notice the features, though: no noise, no fans, no dust to deal with, all while
allowing full speed top-of-the-line processors.  Looking to build a PC to run the
home theater you are building around your $15000 TV and $10000 speaker system?  $1200
to make that computer completely silent isn't that bad a deal then.

Zalman has lots of interesting stuff in the area of cooling PCs without making a lot
of noise.  http://www.zalmanusa.com/ is worth a look for anyone building a PC who
cares about noise.
