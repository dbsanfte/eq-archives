This guy is obviously just another ill-informed bandwagon jumper. If he
had a clue what he was talking about, he'd know the mob involved was
just a miniboss, not Aten Ha Ra, the mob with the best loot in the zone.

Well, unless he counts the 'best loot in the zone' as (drumroll please):

***An int caster robe with zero +mana, zero +int/wis, zero FT, and a
research +mod

***A selection of neck/wrist/belt items with Ac10 cha10 hp50 and large
resists to one type, with a PoM rightclick resist to that type (anyone
put resists over 199 these days if they can avoid it?)

***A situational bane 2hs, that is Seb level in VT, and Oasis level
outside, because of the 'working as intended' bane effects

***Gloves: AC15 str35 mod:h2h +3% Eff:vengence 

***Earring: 15ac str15 +25svM Eff: IVU (rightclick 15.0 sec cast)
making up half of it's loot table.

Before you clamour 'My twink would love that!' all these items are
flagged 'Rec Level 60', are nodrop, and not worth the time involved
getting your twink a VT key in the first place. Every main char there
would have significantly superior items already.
