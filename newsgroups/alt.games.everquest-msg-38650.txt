With all due respect, I never cared for raids anyway. They're incredibly boring
to me. (I have a 53 Paladin, retired). I'm much happier exploring, helping and
chatting with my friends. Does that mean I can't pursue some new equipment now
and then, though? Also, how many times have you been on a raid and didn't get
anything for the trouble? I've known people to go on multiple Fire Giant raids
and never win a torque. So, failing that, why can't I quest for something
better than I'm wearing even if it's in a TCC zone? Anyway, I believe Dark
Tiger said it best in another thread, this policy will end up driving away the
role players. We're the people who take the time to help out and have fun doing
it. Remember that the next time you want a port, I'm a lot more likely to do it
for free, than the next person who won't do it at all. But anyway, this is a
heated issue. People like myself are a minority and Verant won't miss us at
all. They will slowly drive away the elder players because we mess up the
economy by playing so long and collecting so much. As to the guild question,
I've been in a few. The people were primarily role player types and as they
leave EQ because of this new change or that nerf, each guild has disbanded for
lack of members. I think it call comes down to choices. Verant is the Gov't and
they make more and more rules taking away long time freedoms and choices. There
will be people who aren't effected who won't care or notice. There will be
people who think it will make they're lives better and are all for it. And then
there are people like myself where every new restriction or  forbidance makes
us wonder how long it will be before the Gov't/Verant tells us what car to
drive and where to live because it's in my best interest to do so. Anyway,
again, sorry to blather or bore. You're right. I may quit after all and the
people who would care don't know it or are already gone. 
C'est La Vie. I do wish the best for all those that stay and hope you have a
ton of fun before something comes along and you choose to join the rest of us
on the other side. :o)
