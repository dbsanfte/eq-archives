Posted some time ago about slow graphics problem - lots of replies
thanks, I had 256ram. Upgraded to 512 and runs like a dream, zoning is
4 times faster, switching characters the same. I use XP home and I
know the graphics card makes a difference but it would appear the ram
was the answer - hopes this helps some one else.

PS thanks Graeme Faelban you saved me lots of aggravation.
