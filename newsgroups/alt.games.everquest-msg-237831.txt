Well...that was an interesting read. I'm not sure how wise it was to put
that out there, seeing as instead of making this woman look bad you may
have just given her ammunition for accusing you of stalking her and the
like, but no doubt it probably felt good to get it off your chest.  People
who avoid dealing with a situation honestly can certainly make one feel
bottled-up.
