The question was specific, but like a good politician,
he answered in a very vague manner.  I think people 
are getting ahead of themselves anticipating a raise
in level to 70.  It could be that, or 65 plus more
AA stuff, or just more AA type stuff.  Until they come
out and say what it is, getting worked up about it
(like the guy who said he could no longer play if the
level cap was lifted) or getting excited about it is
premature.  Personally, I'm just going to wait and see,  
and worry about getting somewhere close to 60 first :)
 
The distance from 52 to 60 isn't trivial :/
