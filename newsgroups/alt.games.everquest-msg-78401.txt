I highly recommend Dalnirs ( Crypt of Dalnir, I think is the right name ).  
To be safe, wait until 30. The 18% EXP bonus and never-ending supply of 
Mobs is just plain beaufitul.

It's sort of a BYOGroup zone, though.  The 3 of us - 2 warriors and a 
cleric, went there at level 30.  We grouped with various people that would 
wander into there, and now we have our solid group of 6, after taking a 
shammy, monk, and bard that we met there along with us to the next dungeon 
( Kaesora ).

Until you get a group of people you trust and group well with, stay at the 
entrance for a while, and then move into the "L" room eventually.

Before we got the bard, we were able to handle all the adds, but it would 
get scary once in a while.  If we hadn't understood our roles so well, we 
would have had several TPWs.  Our puller, Ughhies, has a problem with math 
and relative danger.  "inc 3" usually means "get ready for a big-ass pull 
of 6 mobs, 4 of them casters." "Medium pull" is something to worry about.  
"Hard pull" usually means 110% effort and concentration, everyone OOM, 
everyone about dead, and hoping that "room pop" timer isn't about to go 
off.  But, we love danger and love the thrill of seeing 7-10 corpses at the 
end of the battle - all Mob corpses.  That was before the Bard.

Once you get to the "L" room, have a timer of some sort.  From what we saw, 
the whole zone popped at the same rate, and I think that was 13 minutes.

Learn which mobs are social and which ones aren't.  Which ones flee and 
which ones don't.  Which ones are casters and which ones aren't.

The EXP there was better than OT with such a great group, and it's quieter.  
We left there at level 35-36 and hit Kaesora.  Now, we are levels 42, 41, 
41, 40, 40, 36 and heading to CoM.  I've never been there ( just like I had 
never been to Dalnirs or Kaesora ), so this should be fun.  NO EXP bonus, 
though =(
