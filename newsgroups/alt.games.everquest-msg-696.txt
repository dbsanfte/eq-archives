Yep.  I was lucky enough to group with a great group in the kodiak
caves.  The puller pulled like a madman, but it all worked, there
really was absolutely no downtime at all, with very rapid spawn.
I think we had 3 tanks, 2 druids, and an enchanter.  It was probably
the most fun and the best group I've ever been in.  It was actually
kind of exhausting, I almost didn't dare take my eye off the screen.
