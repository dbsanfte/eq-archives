That's just the thing... no guards -at the higher levels-, not at the newbie
levels.  It's kind of like when someone's wife gets sick at work, and the
chief says "If we were underway, we wouldn't fly you home for that."  Sure,
but we're not underway right now.  It's called situational awareness.  The
guards are there for the newbies, if you're going to remove something that
Verant put in there for them, then you should be willing to do their job.
