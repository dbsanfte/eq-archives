How do you decide who gets the item then, if multiple people want it, who
all have enough points?

I'm not a big fan of base or fixed prices really.   We didn't use them at
all, and I think that caused less problems.

More specificly, the "class cartel" problem was less important than the
problem of smaller upgrades being allowed to rot.  Especially since almost
all of the drops I see linked out of GoD are for all or almost all classes.

I don't really see how a fixed point system could work, unless you had
someone willing to put in an enormous amount of time repeatedly reevaluating
the costs on items as they are surpassed by later drops.   Unless you spend
a lot less time gearing up at each tier than we did.

I'm more in line with what you're saying here.  I prefer dkp to "merit" but
I can see how a merit system could work fine.   I think people that use it
are just begging for guild drama though, well in excess of what most dkp
systems generate.   As an officer (although I've never been one) I would
prefer dkp to avoid that while still getting most of the positive benefits.
As a raider, I prefer dkp because I like to know where I stand, rather than
wondering if someone else is noticing everyones contributions correctly.
