Bah!

Here's the truth

Spent the morning in SBM with my 25 Iksar SK, 25 Human Mage and 24
Enchanter. Met a 22 Halfling warrior there. Our group killed tons of blues,
a few yellows and a couple whites. EXP rocked!

No higher lvels their tried to KS us, take our camp etc. etc.

That is a fact. I was there. We got some nice items! I camped there and am
planning on gaining levels there (goodbye Lake of Ill Manners!)

New loot rules are great! Thank you Verant!
