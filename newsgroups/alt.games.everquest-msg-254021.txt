You have the spell light healing which will be very valuable in PC.
You also have a dot (damage over time) called Tainted Breath which can
be quite handy for dealing damage.  You also have Cure Disease which
players will thanks you for if they are tanking some of the mobs in PC
which give a nasty disease called Crud. (you may need to cast this a
few times to clear the disease.  Apart from these tank as has already
been suggested.

You really are there as a healer first, particularly if there is no
other healer.  Your secondary role is as a tank in PC.  The only time
you would slow is when the group are taking on a big mob such as
Marciciella (sp?).
