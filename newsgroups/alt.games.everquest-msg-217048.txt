I'd say usually the cleric, enchanter or shaman but there's no
definite rule as to which one if the group has several of those.
Cleric can be OOM but if the chanter and backup healer has mana
there's no need to evac. Chanter and cleric can be OOM but if
everything is slowed and the shaman has mana to keep up with
torpor/quiessence then there's no need to evac. 

In general I'd say any of those 3 classes in the group but I often see
situations where one of them cancels the call to evac. It comes down
to how much you trust the judgement of your group.
