I recommend getting:

War Marshall's Bladed Staff:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19054
2HS Dly=28 Dmg=31
Dex+9 Sta+9 Agi+9 DRes+5 PRes+5 HP+50

Usually about 10k


Adjutant's Saber:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17879
1HS Dly=28 Dmg=26
Proc: Ethereal Stun
Dex+7 Wis+9 Int+9 Agi+7 FRes+5 CRes+5 HP+35
PAL and SHD Only

ATM very cheap on rodcet, usually 1-2k


Hammer of Silent Screams:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23441
2HB Dly=39 Dmg=34
Proc: Knight's Blessing (180HP heal)
Ac+10 Wis+8 DRes+7 MRes+7 PRes+7 HP+30 Mana+30
PAL only

Dirt cheap, usually less than 1k - worth it for the fun of fighting with it
sometimes, although you don't mention 2HB as a skill you levelled up.



Or blow the whole 40k (if you're lucky) on:

Windblade
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16695
2HS Dly=44 Dmg=50
AC+15 Dex+12 Sta+12 HP+35 Mana+35


The War Marshall's Bladed Staff has the same ratio but the low damage/delay
means more riposte damage etc :/
