I'm one of those people who love buying and selling more than playing and I
am getting quite good at it.  Within a few hours last night I started with
500 pp cash and worked up to a Wurmslayer.  A good night might go like this
(as mentioned on another thread).

Find a diamond selling for 300pp, buy it and turn around and sell it for
500.  You now have 700pp.

Find a Mithril BP selling for 500 and turn around and sell it for 800 You
now have 1k.

 Find a Sarnak Skullspitter that is being dumped for 1k, turn around and
sell it for 2k.

Buy a wurmy for 2k, sell it for 2,500 - 3K.

I haven't fought in over a month and when I tried to go back to fighting all
I could think about was how much money I could be making at the tunnel.
Lets see, spend several hours fighting and looting in the dreadlands for a
couple hundred plat (if lucky) or make that in no time at the tunnel.  Maybe
I should join a guild and go into the broker business, but even at that I'd
rather take all the profit than a ten percent cut.
