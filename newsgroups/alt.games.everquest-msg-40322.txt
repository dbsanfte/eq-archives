PvE-wise Mythic said that the toughest NPC's in DAOC are equal to 16
PC's. That sounds great to those EQ's who know they will never see a
dragon or other boss-MOB. However, won't the uber guilds just farm all
the bosses then? I don't know. With the beta NDA it's hard to tell. I
do know the uber items are quested for--not dropped by bosses. So by
definition the uber guilds shouldn't waste their time farming less
than uber items. (Also in DAOC equipment is not suppose to matter as
much as in EQ.) Won't they monopolize the 'epic' quests then? Well you
can't farm quest items in DAOC due to their dynamic, random quest
engine. (I won't go into to details...see the DOAC website for more
details)

PvP-wise uber guilds look like a plus and not a minus. There was a
huge PvP battle the other day in beta where 200-300 PC's fought at
once. (Amazingly, testers reported little lag.) Thus, it sounds like
PvP raids will have room for uber guilds, social guilds, and casual
players to fight side-by-side.
