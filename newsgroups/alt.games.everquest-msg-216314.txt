    I was just wondering if there was an agreement  on what the best
droppable weapon was for a Cleric, Dwarf specifically. With LDON I have
found myself meleeing a lot , which is fun, but I want to get a better
weapon then just the summoned hammers.

    Cost is really not a concern, I just want a 1HB weapon that will allow
me to dish out as much damage as possible.
