If you need eggs for baking, try the basilisk caves in JPG. At around
30-35, you should be able to handle them well since they're pretty
much all single pullable (I'm pretty sure. I didn't find them until
I was higher, but I've never had more than one on me at a time.)
It's the genitors that drop the eggs.
