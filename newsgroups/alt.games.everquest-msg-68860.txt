That's probably true, but does not change the fact that there are quite a
few people who meet or exceed the specs who are having problems.  In a guild
of about 100, there are 4 people that I know of who have problems with
systems that are well above the specs, despite trying everything that they,
and others of us can find for them to try.  There are also 10 to 15 that
have systems that need some serious upgrades to work with the updated EQ
(About half of them fall in between the minimum and recommended specs).  We
are talking about 14 to 19 percent of the guild here, 4 percent with systems
that are well above the specs.  This seems to indicate that there are some
serious issues to be dealt with yet.  The minimum specs that Verant puts
forth are a joke if you really want to play.  The recommended specs are
really more like what the minimum specs should be.
