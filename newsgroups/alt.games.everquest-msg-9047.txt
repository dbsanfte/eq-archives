The FBSS haste effect is roughly 21% and this is a constant haste effect not
a proc. The haste effect works on all melee attacks Bash Slam and Kicks not
sure but I think on ranged attacks also. the FBSS will stack with any spell
type haste but will not stack with other item haste effects such as Mirth
2hs or a Cloak of Flame. a 43dly would become a 34-35dly with an FBSS but
keep in mind each weapon has a cap for a minimum delay about half. Can't say
what happened with the guy with the weighted axe but where you diplying
yours and his Misses also you may have been swing more and missing while due
to skill he was making contact almost every swing but can't say.
