"Larry G" <larryhg3@snet.net> > So I will ask here which one do you guys
> recommend and how do I get to them where do I bind etc

From personal experience I would say goto High Hold ...
The exp can come in thick and fast, and some of the gobbos not only drop
upto 3.5pp but also drop bronze weapons and armour which sells rather nice
(or you can use it to fill any gaps you have in your own slots)

You didnt mention what race/class combination you where however ... but
seeing as your asking about binds I guess your not a pure caster and unable
to bind your self.

heres a few pointers

1) The NPC's of this zone are human and as such dont much like evil races or
classes ...

2) Killing gnolls and orcs in the pass will put your faction up but is very
boring and long winded (took my Delf SK about 2 days to get into the city)

3) Each of the gates in the pass are guarded by voluneers (sorry not
re-installed any spell checking software yet :) ) these guys are a great way
to test your faction as they are VERY low lvl (around 5 ish i think,) and so
if they do attack you its safe to wander to the zone and de-agrro

4) You can be bound right over by the zone line of the pass zone bordering
on klith woods, or anywhere in the city (most people prefer the bank) BUT
there are no soul-binders in either zone, meaning you will have to ask a PC
to help you out

5) The Gobbos are located in the cellar of the city, but be warned the
guards in this zone are not very high lvl compared to the goblins, and so
can take some time to kill a train, your best bet is either to try and zone
(its a longish run) or get as many guards as possible to help you out.

6) This zone does have food/drink, gems, bags, and other basic items for
sale, but they can be a pain to find.

7) Finding a group can sometimes take forever !! This zone is often horribly
over-crowded and over-camped meaning you may have to sit around for 20
minutes plus waiting for a opening !!


As to how you reach the hold ?

It depends where you are starting from, once again you didnt really say, so
I'm going to assume you are in the WC or closeby (after all its close to
freeport, Delf city and a druid TP).
First you need to head to the top right corner of the zone (west ish) you
will find the zone line to kilthnor woods, Be warned unless you have invis
vs undead traveling at night in klith woods is a VERY bad idea, (lots of
nasty undead spawn at night in the woods)

I think the best route to take is hugg the right wall, run past the entrance
to Rivervale (halfling city) and keep going onto High pass, (going left is a
little faster but you can run into some annoying NPC Orcs)

Once you zone be a bit careful of the wandering Orcs (they seem to aggro on
almost everyone) www.eqatlas.com as a map of this area, you want to head to
the city (I always get lost so I'm not even going to attempt to guide you
;p )

Well thats about it ... I hope some of this proves useful and good luck !!
