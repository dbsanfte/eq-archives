From a level 52 ranger point of view:  What Ben Said.  To do the Elites in
Rygorr Fort:

Invis
Run in, choose furthest elite
Run out, harmony
Invis
Run in, choose chief
run out, harmony
invis
Run in choose closest elite
run out, snare, run for the wall.
 
Takes alot of time and mana, (rangers have so much mana after all), and if
there's more than one group there, there's no guaranteeing they understand what
you are doing, (or care).  They can run in and muck it up real quick.  Then
there's a train to the CC zone and you get to start over, if you are lucky and
don't get caught up IN the train.
