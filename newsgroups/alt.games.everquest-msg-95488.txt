So the pathing from point X where the mob is on one side of the water to
point Y where you are standing on the other side of the water is such
that the mob can not make a straight line from X to Y, rather the mob
must take a longer path.  By quickly moving between X and Y you
effectively prevent the mob from reaching you.  Intentional repetition
of this moving from X to Y to X is exploiting pathing, though if you
prefer another word such as terrain you are welcome to use it.  Water is
not required for this to happen, any place where pathing is such that
there exists an X and a Y where the mob is unable to take that shortest
route that a player is able to follow the same situation exists and in
all cases (except for the special exception that someone will  post in
reply to my statement <G>) it is an exploit.
