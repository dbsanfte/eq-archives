So does mine, "The Aviaks(in Lake Rathe) start to green out at 23"  Just
because your reading comprehension SUCKS, isn't my problem.

Aren't you the one whinging about how hard it is to beg a port because
you were dumb enough to get KoS in Freeport?

Here's a clue, go kill gnolls in highpass, turn in scalps and get unKoS
in Freeport.
