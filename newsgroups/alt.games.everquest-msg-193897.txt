That is correct. However, speed buffs generally can't be refreshed
underground. That extra 10% (or 30% for Run3) could save your life
in a dungeon. (Or if for some reason you don't have a run buff up).

It also means certain kinds of kiting (chant kiting?) can be done
without any sort of run speed buff up.
