You should see all the whining that has caused on some of the message
boards.  When realm point rewards weren't in at launch, certain people
whined that RvR was meaningless, and the game would quickly die unless
this was fixed.  OK, it's fixed.

Now many people (and I'm pretty sure many of them are the *same*
people) are whining that adding realm point rewards is unfair and will
ruin the game, because the classes and realms aren't perfectly
balanced, and so archers and Midgard have been "exploiting" for the
last month and have earned a bunch of points unfairly.  They want all
the points to be reset.

If you miss the old EQ boards, before they changed to a fully
moderated system, just go look at the Camelot boards at
camelotvault.ign.com.
