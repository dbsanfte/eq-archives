Yes, I do.  Did you read what he said?  He said the measurements were of
damage output.  Check it again if you're unsure of exactly what he said:
http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=67.  Here's a quote:
"Haste is measured in Damage Increase, NOT Delay Decrease."

I'm not saying I agree with him, I'm pointing out the fact that he's saying
haste is measured in damage increase, not delay decrease (and as a
by-product, speed increase).
