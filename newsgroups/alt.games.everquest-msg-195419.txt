	Hey All,

	Wondering if you all could lend me a hand :) I took a year and
half vacation from EQ and now I am back with all the expansions...
The only thing is my LV44 Trollie Warrior is still in 90% crafted
armor.
	Right now we are catching up my GF's shammie (she is 35 right
now) and then we want to hunt down some armor for me.  What would you
recomend that a group of Mid 40's can hunt for in any of the new
expansions?  I am trying to play catch up but SSOO much has changed
and been added and I am lost now PLEASE HELP My trollie needs new
clothes :) 

	Esplay
