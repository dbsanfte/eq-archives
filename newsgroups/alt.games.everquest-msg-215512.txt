The person in freeport is located in the tavern near the bank.  I
think its the Jade -something or other-.  The only other solution
to the problems your seeing (that I can think of) is some people
who's home town may be one of two places (Freeport/Qeynos)
might get triggered if passing through either.  This may work with
any city that you have a high faction. /shrug
