Close, you're probably thinking of Protection of the Primmadonna,
which is self-only HP/AC/CHA with a Rune-type damage absorbtion
component as well.  As it's currently being tested the value of
the bonuses is reagent dependant.  Some of the reagents are drops
off 65+ mobs while others can be made from foraged food/drink via
Alchemy or Poison-making.  I haven't seen any confirmed recipes
yet, but it is rumored that the best results seen to date are
from Rouge made by Poison-making.
