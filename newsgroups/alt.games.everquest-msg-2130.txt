I can run the Everquest tutorial and play on the test server without a
problem. The video and sound work fine. However, when trying to start the
standard Everquest game the system locks a few seconds after I click the
"Play online" button. I never see the agreement window with the
accept/decline buttons or a menu to choose a video adapter, just a blank
screen when the monitor clicks off as if the system was shut down.

Here's a list of things I have done so far that have not solved this
problem:
- fdisk, format and reinstall with windows98se and directx 7a from Everquest
CD, install Velious and all patches.
- uninstall/reinstall Everquest with only the necessary patches to play
online. (standard file check)
- format and reinstall of windows98se and directx 8.0 from Microsoft's web
site and only the necessary patchs to start the game
- copied over the Everquest directory from a friends computer that does run
Everquest with Velious and all patches

I have seen this exact problem before on another similar system that we
could not fix. It remained that way for a couple weeks until Everquest was
started after a patchday. The new patch downloaded and Everquest started up
fine.

System specs:
PentiumII 350
ASUS SCSI motherboard
128mb RAM
8gig SCSI HD with lots of avalible space
V550 16mb Diamond Mulitimedia video card
PCI128 Soundblaster sound card

Currently I am working with eqtech on this but wanted to hit all the bases I
could. The only response from eqtech so far has been automated.

Thanks for any help you can give,
Rob
