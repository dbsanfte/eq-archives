My "old-style-pre-PoP-equipped" (retired)level 55 Druid,Forest Loop,
Elysian Armour and comparable stuff,has 1200hps,but 255 Wis,lol.
My Bazaar- and heavy on hpgear- equipped 45 Enchanter,Velium
Fire Wedding Rings,Cloak of Greater Pernicityand such, has 1600
hps.
So I would guess the average mid-fifties bazaar-equipped (Int)caster 
nowadays has around 2k hps rather a little less.
