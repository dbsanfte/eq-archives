Just something that intrigues me:

I was in the Bazaar the other day, and saw Spiderling and Black Spider 
Silks on sale for 8gp - 2pp.  Do people really pay that much ??

I've lost count of the silks I've sold for a few silver, or the ones my 
Ogre SK or Human Ranger have used.  I think I've still got some 
somewhere, am I sitting on a fortune or are some people just on another 
planet.... ?

Thanks for any replies.
