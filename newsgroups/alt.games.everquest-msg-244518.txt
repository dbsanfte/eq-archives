I live in China (Beijing) and play EQ regularly.  When I first started
in 2000, I used 9600 modem and had to pay by the minutes!  Now we have
ADSL at home(and recently a fixed charge of RMB120 per month i.e.
about US$15)and I can have a character in Bazzar all day long when I
am at work.  I also now 3 boxing EQ.

Usually there is no issue of lag, except perhaps during the Chinese
New Year (late Ja./Feb) for some reasons. Shanghai should be the same
as Beijing.

No need to play on Chinese server, you can log into US servers without
any problem.  I play on the Torv. server.  One problem is the time
difference... evening in China is about mid-night to 5am in US.  So
you probably would not be able to group with your guild mates.  Also
the usual Sony patch time of Thursday 3am Pacific is our prime time
Friday 7pm :(

If you are staying at hotel that provide DSL, it should work OK. 
However, they do charge you by the day (usually about US$10 per 24
hours), unless you have a long term lease then it may be free.

For the 3 boxing, I used to use a Sony portable as one of the boxes
with no problem.  But it is quite a good portable of P4 with 510MB
RAM, 32MB delicated video card.  As suggested by the other person, you
may want to test yours out before bringing it over (make sure it's
power supply works on dual voltage: 110v/220v).  If you have problem
with the portable, you may want to consider buying a local make PC and
monitor in Shanghai.  They are very reasonable price and you can sell
it or take it home with you when you leave.  Just buy one with dual
voltage 110v/220v.

Hope this help.
