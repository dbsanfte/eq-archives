Not even close.  Agility is damn near useless.  Once it is above 75, even a 20
point hit to agility is worth about 4 armor class.   Thats it.  No defensive
skill bonuses, no nothing.  Just a very slight armor class increase.

Compared to the amount of hit points you will gain at higher levels from a
stamina boost, stamina beats agility as a defensive item.

Stamina is important for hit points.   Once you're over 100 stamina, there are
no ill effects from fighting while out of stamina, so it has little to do with
offense.
