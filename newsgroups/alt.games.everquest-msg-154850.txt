How about you parse your logs before and after
the nerf and see how bad it actually is. Then compare with
other melee classes in the same defensive category like the
ranger and the rogue. Before you go flying off the handle?

Plain and simple monks should not be able to tank like a Warrior,
or a Paladin or SK for that matter. Those are the Tank/Plate
classes that should be tanking.

Christ you'd think Verant was trying to take away people's first
born child or something.
