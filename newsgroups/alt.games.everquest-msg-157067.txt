Ya gotta keep up man.  Paladins have a real role for a number of raid
targets these days, at least according to the higher end types who
post here.  And it looks to me like Clerics aren't actually worse than
Paladins as soloers, they just aren't usually stubborn enough as
players to gut it out.  Either that or they just genuinely like helping
people (known a lotta Clerics like that) and soloing isn't at all what
they want to do.
