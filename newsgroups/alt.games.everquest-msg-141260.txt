If you don't care about xp at the time, here's a thought. You pallies
are really good with undead, yes? And at your level you should be able
to single pull up to a certain level.

Go pop into ToFS and get the keys and work your way up to the fourth and
fifth floor. Bunch of stuff drops there that you can sell in the bazaar.
None of it is "OH MY GOD" multiple KPP stuff, but check prices and see
what the market will bear. There's some nice items and you could get
lucky. Then just set yourself up with a bazaar mule for when you're not
playing and see who bites.
