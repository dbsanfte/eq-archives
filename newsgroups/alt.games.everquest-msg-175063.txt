    And what level do you suppose those players are? Post-60, which puts
them out of the target range of the new expansion. That's why there has to
be content for players up to level 65. I'm not saying there has to be RAID
content - there's plenty of that in game now. But if you don't design it so
you can get XP there to 65 like in PoP, it'll be obsolete before it's
released. And honestly, the game could use a few nice 60+ dungeons.
