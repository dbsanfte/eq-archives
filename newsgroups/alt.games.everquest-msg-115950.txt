Certainly I believe that EQ changes your personality.  But I think that
every experience we go through changes our personality.  For example,
someone who becomes temporarily obsessed with EQ (in extreme cases) might
well become far less easy to get on with in "real-life" terms.  But then,
let's not forget that ANY obsession is likely to have similar effects.
Notable similarities occur in, for example, religion, or indeed in
relationships.  When someone finds themselves a new boy/girlfriend or
whatever, or when they first get involved in a church or cult, then that's
all they can think about for a time.  It takes up the majority of their
interest for a while and everything else has to take a back seat.  That's
pretty annoying for friends and family, but depending on the personality of
the individual, everything will eventually return to normal over time.  With
some people it'll happen within weeks, for others it'll be months or years.

But even for 'normal' people (if there is such a thing), I think that holds
true.  And what you say about some people becoming more abusive as they
progress relates, I believe, to that return of 'reality'.  Most folk on EQ
are, in my experience, pretty polite and generally happy to help out
provided they're treated with respect.  That's normal, and I think that
reflects their real-life nature.  Most newbies are pretty polite because
either that's who they are (most often), or because they don't feel
confident enough to behave in any other way.  But there are a few, of
course, who become particularly obnoxious as they get more powerful - and I
think this is due to the fact that this is who they ARE in real life.  There
ARE, for want of a better word, assholes out there who treat REAL people
like this, and for them, it's to be expected that once the awe of the
gameworld starts to wear off, they'll gain in confidence and they'll start
to return to their true personalities.

I suppose to some degree we all get irritated from time to time when
"newbies" do something that we probably did ourselves.  I confess I've been
known to get annoyed at learner drivers, even though a moment's thought
tells me that I was there myself once.  So I suppose that's natural to an
extent, even if not very helpful.  But it's down to how we ACT on those
feelings, I reckon.  It's not wrong to get annoyed or irritated - but it's
wrong to criticize someone unconstructively or be abusive to them for making
simple mistakes.
