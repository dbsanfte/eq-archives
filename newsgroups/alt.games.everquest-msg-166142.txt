There was a character with that name (or one very very close to it) on
Tunare server some time ago.  Saw him around quite a bit for a while,
in all the usual zones for 20s and 30s, then he mysteriously disappeared
(this was before the naming policy change).  When people wanted to talk
to him they would /ooc "hey barcode, send me a tell" so they could auto-
reply instead of having to try and type the name correctly.
