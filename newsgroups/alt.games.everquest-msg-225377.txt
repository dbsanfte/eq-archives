Me, too. I'm expecting my usual partner to be back in town tonight, too, so
I'm gonna try and recruit him to come (he's got a 52 Cleric who's been on
hold like us).

It's going to be tricky because the in-laws are visiting for Thanksgiving
and they arrive tomorrow afternoon. Fortunately, the raid begins at 2pm EST
(11am where I'm at) and the in-laws don't show up until around 5-6pm. I'm
hoping we will be done by then?
