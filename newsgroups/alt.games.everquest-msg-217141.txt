The web page has been down for casters realm all day long, but there is a great
page there you might want to look at when the page comes back up that tells you
the exact spot to med without getting aggro...

Path is somthing like, http://eq.castersrealm.com/ > Druids > something like
"player forums"> then 49 and up> then look at the titles of the hunting guides
until you see the one about quad kiting the raptors....the guy gives a very
good detailed way to do it safely...

John
