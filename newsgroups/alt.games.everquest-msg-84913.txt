My installation of EverQuest also freezes at random spots.

I have a Celeron 766MHz, 256Meg RAM, TNT2Ultra,  MX300 Sound card.
Windows 2000 latest patches/updates, latest drivers. Reinstalled
drivers. Reinstalled OS - fresh install (not because of this btw).

Tried NOSOUND.TXT, increasing virtual mem to a gig, extra cooling for
the CPU. Kicked out all irrelevant background programs and  services.
No difference.

Other games, like Return to Castle Wolfenstein, or NanDub will run for
many many hours in a row without ever having a hitch. EverQuest *used*
to run without a hitch.

SonyEQVerant site indicates that Microsoft have it wrong when they
place all the cards (sound & video) on the same IRQ. Seems that Verant
are the only ones having a problem with it TMK.

As far as I am concerned: EverQuest is broken, please fix the fricker.
