I finally got in around 12:30am (yes, it took that long to fight for time on
the patch server!).  Took my lvl30 druid to Jaggedpine.  About 95% of the
MOBs on Tracking were red to me.  There were one or two yellows and whites.

The new treants looked great, if a bit scary.  Some of the MOBs I remember
were Darkpaw gnolls, giant anaconda, timber griffs, wolves, bears, wisps.  I
did not wander far from the zone-in point.  The zone itself reminded me of
DSP...only not as laggy.  There are some aggressive MOBs  near the zone-in
but you're ok unless someone pulls one close.  I wouldn't just start killing
everything.  Some of the other players said they received faction hits
(probably from killing bears).

I'll probably take my lvl42 mage there tonight and check out the zone a bit
more.
