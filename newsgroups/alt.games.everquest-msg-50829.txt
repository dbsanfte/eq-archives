You got screwed.

1. If his account was hacked what makes you think it wont
happen again and all his 'borrowed' stuff gets stolen again?

2. A level 53 warrior should have enough friends and guild
mates to help him get new stuff.

3. A level 53 warrior even if he is naked with a rusty sword
could clear out some low level dungeons and build up cash
very easily.
