This is my understanding of Mem Blur:

Your position on a mob's hate list is qualified as a number.  The more
damage you do, the higher your Hate Number.  Likewise, spells that
don't do damage (debuffs) still have a Hate Value assigned to them.

Mem Blur (and Atone) reduces a fixed amount of the total Hate from a
mob.  If it's total accumulated Hate is high, you'll have to cast Mem
Blur or Atone a few times to completely wipe the list.
