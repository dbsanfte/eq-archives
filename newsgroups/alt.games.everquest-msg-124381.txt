Been doing this armor a while now.
This is something I found (could be just a coincident) there are two ruins
that have diseased rats.I had been hunting the ruins to the left of the ent.
of Rivervale (if your leaving Rivervale).Never found any mossy rat pelts and
a scant amount of ruined.Then I found the one with the scarecrow ,Old
Gordhead I think his name is.And within 15 min I had 2 mossy rat pelts.But
now its the giant wood spiders and they spawn like one or two every 10 min
it seams.I have yet to get the femur or the patella,is there a secret way to
keep them spawning ,or is it just gunna take for ever?
