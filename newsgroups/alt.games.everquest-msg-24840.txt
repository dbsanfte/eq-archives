Hello

I read about the Bread quest here the other day, tried it, and wow! great
exp and not bad loot for lvl 24, shame they just nerfed it in the last
patch. I had told a friend about it, who has just started up a druid, lvl10
at mo, so he tried it after the patch to see if it was still good at that
lvl, ....and no, not really.

Just wondered, are there any others like this...  I know about the gnoll
fangs, GLS, Belts, Sashes etc, just wondered if there were any more for the
Mid lvls?...

Made a nice change, from the Kill, med, Kill, med cycle..

I used to play a game called The Realm, they used a similar idea, so that
the players who aren't interested in fighting could gain exp and advance
too. Would be nice if we had this option in the game, and I don't think it
would be too much of an easy route, the exp I gained from the Bread run was
really good, but no better than I get from a Highpass group...

Not gonna hold ma breath.

BTW, I ain't afeared 'o' fightin, just that the more options ya got...the
better I say!
