G'day,

A while ago, SOE were handing out free EQ Trilogy account trials and I was
wondering if anyone knew how to get one of these now, as i never got the
email that everyone else seemed to.

There is a free trial from the EQ website, but this is only for classic EQ,
not the trilogy. I would be appreciative if someone could help me, because
it is beyond my means to go and buy all the software all over again.

Cheers,
Qaelan
