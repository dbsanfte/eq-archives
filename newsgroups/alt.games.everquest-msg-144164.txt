That's what I was trying to do.  However, apparently there are no
boats going from Qeynos to Erudin; just a gnome translocator on the
Qeynos dock.  She talks about the boats not working and how they are
investigating the problem, but that she will translocate me to Erud's
Crossing and her assistant at Erud's Crossing will help me complete my
journey.  Well, she translocated me to Erud's Crossing (the dock on
Kerra Island) but I can't find the other translocator to send me from
Erud's Crossing to Erudin.
