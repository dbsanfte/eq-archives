How about Ranger?  Easier than a druid...from 1 through 8, you don't
even have magic, so no distracting spells to deal with while learning
the game.

Rangers are useful in groups.  Below the highest levels, they can be
the tank if needed.  If not needed as a tank, they have great damage
output, and useful utility spells.

Once they get "Panic Animal", they are among the best soloers in the
game.  Snare, Panic, and then run along behind whacking it.

Tracking is a very nice ability, and rangers are the masters of
tracking.  Bards and druids get it, too, but only rangers get to sort
and filter the tracking list, and rangers tracking has a much bigger
range.
