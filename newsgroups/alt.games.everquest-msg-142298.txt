Yes, but for once it's a tailoring thingie that's *not* a nightmare.
(Perhaps the only time nightmare and tailoring aren't required to be in
the same sentence. If you just start with the silks, they are a no fail
combine to make swatches that will get your skill up to 16 (?) or so.
Then, there are some easy to acquire items for combines that will get
you up to the relatively low skill required to make paddings. Once you
can make paddings trivially, you can forget about tailoring work.
Doesn't take long to trivial paddings. It's the poor bastards who are
trying to get skillups past the 150's and 200's who you see sitting on
the floor in the corner of the tavern crying and prying their own
fingernails off all the time.

I still think that's your play if money is no concern, even though the
number of things per combine is insane and you'll be juggling a lot of
containers and carrying tons of weight. I'd do it in the bazaar if the
forge is free, were I you. That "no encumbrance" deal is a lifesaver
there for heavily burdened smithing students.

"As long as we're offering him advice, we could add this: Instead of
taking up tailoring, get a ball peen hammer and whack yourself on the
head every 15 minutes. Over all, it's certainly less painful, and very
probably more productive."
