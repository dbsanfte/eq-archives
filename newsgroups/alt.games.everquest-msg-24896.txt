Ah, those were the days. In your 20's and 30's not really thinking about 
leveling and planes, and such. 

<snip the mid level angst>

  Unfortunately, the way the rules are laid out, I think this may be the 
only way to play. Unless you already have several teams of 50's you're 
pretty much shut out of the raids. I've been in four guilds on MM and 
Drinal. ALL suffered the SAME fate. 

  My first guild was Realm of Valor on MM. I was mid 20's and most of 
the officers and other players were around 30. I'm in the "many 
characters not so many levels" column. By the time I was 30 most of the 
people I played with were in the 50's and I no longer had a reason to 
stay. As a matter of fact, my own guildleader asked who I was when it 
came time for meetings.

  Next came Order of Dragonbane. Nice guild, met my RL fiance in there. 
:) About a month or two in, we started bleeding off the 45+'s. This 
continued for about three or four months before the internal power 
struggle occurred and ripped the guild apart. There are now about four 
guilds that I know of on MM/Drinal started from the fragments of OoD.

  Next came Drinkers of Ale. This was absolutely the BEST guild I've 
ever been in. Unfortunately, latelevelitis crept in here too. The 
leaders had a novel approach though. They merged with Lords of the Ter's 
Tai. I won't show the bitterness here, but I will say that the 
leadership there sucks. The merger was NOT handled well. There was 
animosity on both sides and the leaders tried to smooth it over, but it 
never worked. Then they tried the fascist rules and alienated even more 
people.

 Needless to say, I've felt your pain. My fiance came up with an idea 
when DoA was thinking about merging. You kinda hit on it in your last 
sentence. The "Farm Team" approach. As your guildies start to level into 
45+ have them start a new guild. Your own major league if you like. Send 
out emissaries to your "uber" guilds (or those in a similar situation as 
yours) and ask for alliances. I'm not sure it will work since most 
"ubers" won't really talk to you unless you'll switch your tag for 
theirs, but it might work for you. 

 I hope it works out for you and let us know what happens.
