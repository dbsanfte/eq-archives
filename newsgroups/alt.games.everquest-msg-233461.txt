Cleric hate is pretty standard everywhere . They are one of the most
powerfull classes needed for raids and groups in very large numbers. Clerics
also tend to suck at their class. They ended up as clerics because they
could not handle the stresses of any other class and clerics are just plain
easy and well rewarded. This has lead to an extremely large number of
secondary and twink clerics that show exactly how bad the situation is. I
would generally rather be grouped with a twink cleric being played as a 2nd
account on a machine in another room than be grouped with a real cleric.

p.s. there are good real clerics. On my server there must be 20 or so of
them aout of thousands.....

p.p.s oh and i never hold it against anyone for denying the use of their
time. If I want a res I res myself with my twink cleric :)
