Aww, you beat me to it.... I was going to suggest Dungeon Siege as well.  I
just got it, and am having a blast with it so far.

I tried AO for a couple of months and really enjoyed it as well (had a lot
of fun grouping in AO--moreso than grouping in EQ, for some reason I can't

  However, my computer is having this habit of fatally crashing every time I
try to play AO lately, so I gave it up.
