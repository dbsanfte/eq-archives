So just a quick note; I'm still MT a lot.  Yeah, I'm an SK, and there 
are other SK my level in the guild, as well as a warrior who's closing 
in fast.

But it turns out the warrior is often not present on raids, the other 
two SK at 60 are, respectively, the guild leader and the raid leader.

I have my own "title", which is class leader, however, that duty doesn't 
actually entail much work at all, and has never entailed any work during 
an actual raid.

Since the guild leader is busy trying to handle "issues", and being 
master looter and calling out the bidding and so on, she's not really 
punching bag material.

Since the raid leader is busy trying to coordinate the overall raid and 
coraal a bunch of people half of whom have never really raided much at 
all in the past, he prefers not to be MT, although he certainly does so 
in a pinch.

If I'm around, though, they'd rather have me MT than either of them, 
just to lighten their work loads.

If the warrior is around, even though he's several levels lower than I 
am, he still gets the nod; Defensive trumps level on the really hard 
mobs, and the guild is too wet behind the ears to have one MT for 
working your way in, then switch to a second MT for the boss; yeah, 
we've done it on occaision, but if at all possible, we avoid switching 
MT midstream and dealing with all the people who neglected to change 
their assist hotkeys.

What this means to me, though, is that at the moment I've lucked into a 
dream position; I'm playing a tank class which actually gets to do jobs 
a tank is suited for; MT about half the time, Offtank on many of the 
remaining occaisions, ST in the remainder.  Yeah, ST is a lot like Vice 
Governor; you don't do much but have to be ready in case the real guy 
croaks... but that happens frequently enough that it remains interesting 
(only in EQ can you make a career out of replacing the guy who dies, 
repeatedly... and not get arrested for it)

If the guild recruits more warriors, or some of the much lower level 
warriors manage to catch up while we're all still stalled at 60, that 
position will be in jeopardy, but at the moment, its the sweet life... 
and I stopped playing that little wizard alt I rolled up because things 
were going to get boring as a 60 SK with no use for exp.
