You have to admit though, wizards weren't getting exp groups much back
then. Post Kunark, wizard's desirability in most exp groups was
extremely low, and if guilds hadn't started to recruit wizards to kill
trak and vs back in the day when they were hard, it's likely most of
them would have vanished. Wizard's dps in a grinding exp group is
limited completely by their mana and with pre-kei mana regen that made
them very poor contributors to the group.
