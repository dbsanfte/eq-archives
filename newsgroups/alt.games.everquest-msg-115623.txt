I've pulled one of those....

Go to the Grey, run around the zone for 15 minutes at random without invis
(don't stop moving)

Tadaa!  Uber-train!  (same thing is doable in Umbral Plains or Maidens Eye,
but you have to be more careful since you can get a lot of harm touches or
backstabs that kill you a LOT faster than anything in the Grey;  stuff in
the Grey max hits around 120 mostly, stuff in UP max hits around 200 on
average, stuff in ME max hits similarly to the Grey, but about half of the
stuff there has either a major lifetap proc (coterie) or a harm touch
(4-arms and robe guys)
