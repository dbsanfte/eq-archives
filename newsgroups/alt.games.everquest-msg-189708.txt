There does seem to be a sort of middle ground where it's not as difficult 
to get skillups as the highend, but you success on things enough that it's 
not as difficult as the extreme lowend.  Sense heading seems to work this 
way as well.  Once you get your skill over about 30 it'll max with a few 
minutes of mashing every time you ding.  Getting the last few points to 200 
is still a bitch though.
