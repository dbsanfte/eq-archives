I don't let people I "know" in game "borrow" anything of mine. I once
loaned a player 200 plat, they disappeared and that was it for me no
more loans. I think of it the way I think of it in real life, I'm not
a bank and if you want a loan go to a bank. So I guess you'd say that
is another facet of my in game roleplaying. 

No one "hacks" an account anyway. He let someone use his account and
he should not have and they sold all his stuff. This just happened in
a guild of mine where a person was letting 2 or more people share his
account. The thing is, both of them now swear it was not them. It was
obviously one of them but he will never know because he was so naive. 

Letting someone share your account is a breach of security like
loaning things to someone.

Aahhahaha.. AHAHAHA.. . AHAHHHAA Cobolt Bp.. AHAHAHA,
yeah, because those are not rare or anything and very valuable.

Clue: he has nothing and is borrowing a mith bp from you. If he has to
do that how is he going to have the resources to get a cobolt one?

Ahahhaha oh yeah, sure.

Laughed, I would have laughed quite a lot actually and probably out
loud. Then I would have reported and petitioned since it was pretty
obvious he was trying to screw people out of equipment.

Either he was Bs'ing you or you are Bs'ing us with this story. If its
the later I fully expect you to post at some later time saying, "oh
yeah he gave me a cobolt bp."
