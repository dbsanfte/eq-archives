Anyone (beta testers)  know if they plan to change the class-specific names
for post-60 characters?
i.e. Ranger->Pathfinder->Outrider->Warder->?

Should a L65 char have the same name as a L60?  Depends on how hard it will
be to get there, but to be honest, some of the L60 names are great -
Warlord, Arch Mage, Sorcerer, High Priest, and I would be unsure as how to
make them uberer :)

Anyone have any suggestions?

Regards,

Tzen.

P.S. Maybe I am biased as my main is a ranger and I think the class name
Warder sucks the sweat from dead men's balls, so anything, say, Smegmonkey,
would be an improvement.

The AA class title, Hunter, OTOH rocks.
