LMAO.. Maybe I'm easily amused, but I'm gonna have to use that one.

I ran into the same thing the other night in Kurrn's Tower.  I was sitting
there happily whacking away at the train of reds I had just pulled.  ok..
ok..   me + powerleveling = guilty

It kinda annoyed me though, when people came over and started trying to help
me out by pulling mobs out of my train and whacking the ones that were
there.  Not that them helping me didn't get me xp faster (I was still doing
over 50 percent damage), but the extra time it took me to kill them would
have been more chances for skill ups.  As it is, they're all *just* maxing
out when I'm about to ding, and that's something I really don't want to fall
behind in.

I guess my situation with this turned out a little better than yours did,
though.  After I talked to them it turned out that they were pretty cool
people and the night went extremely well after that.  I ended up meeting
some people that have the potential of being good EQ friends.
