Well, since the rangeres are up in arms about their DPS, I figure I'll post
something about rogues.  One thing I've yet to figure out about most casters
(necromancers excluded, and a few clerics) is why rogues and their DPS are
associated with their ability to tank.  Maybe it's the LDoN kiddies on the
Drinal server that are finally moving into tier 3, or just a general lack of
experience with the class, who know?  (I don't, which is why I'm posting.)

I've worked on the assumption that since about the time I've entered PoP, it
was more or less common knowledge that rogues were a DPS melee class.  Why
do casters presume that rogues tank?  I've had this problem since my early
days on 46 in PoJ.  Rogues are a chain melee class with not much more health
than casters and significantly lower AC than a monk/berserker/tank whose
usefulness has dwindled to almost nothingness since PoP except for corpse
recovery when people don't feel like waiting for GY.

Examples:

PoJ: 3 rangers, druid, monk, and myself.  Nominated as a puller and the
tank.  Ctrl+D (disband)
PoV EW: ogre SK, cleric, druid, enchanter, necro, wizzy, and me.  The SK
thinks it's funny to FD pull in front of me.  Fortunately the necro cast a
snare DoT so I could evade.   Ctrl+D
BoT south camp: 2 druids, 1 enchanter with a DC pet, me.  Enchanter slows at
30% health.  Druids don't heal.
Druid tells you, "Hey, it'd be helpful if you actually did something."
/msg druid, "Hey, it'd be helpful if you or the other druid actually healed
so I wouldn't be sitting out during four pulls and your botted enchanter
actually slowed before 30%."
Druid tells you, "I'm rooting and dotting, and the pet's out-damaging you."
/msg druid, "Snare and kite.  Player toons always pull agro off of pets."
Druid tells you, "Never figured out how to quite."
Ctrl+D
