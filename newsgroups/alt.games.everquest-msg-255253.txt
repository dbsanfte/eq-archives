For those of us that have spent 4-5 years on the original EQ, how many of
you are going to leave behind those characters and your guilds and all that
time and effort to jump on to EQ II?

Are you planning on exchanging one MMORPG (EQI)for the other, or paying
twice the fee and playing both?

I really do not understand the economic behind SOE's decision to offer a
competitor to its breadwinner.  I think they will leach off numerous EQ I
players, but will they attract new EQ II players to more than offest?

Is there going to be any sort of capacity to bring our old favorite toons
over from EQI?

Someone please explain this to me and how you are going to deal with the
advent of EQII after so long in EQI.
