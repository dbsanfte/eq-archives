Um, try actually killing one...

I took a few whacks at one and despite a few solid 130+ hits,
its health bar didn't budge.  So as an experiment, I stood there
for about 30 minutes slashing the hell out of it (I'm already
maxed at 2HS, so I wasn't even gaining any weapon skills from
the test), and after countless hits totalling many, many, many
thousands of HP, the Soulbinder's health bar had gone down
one pixel -- *maybe* two.

They have like a million HP.

If having to hack at something for 8 hours or so to get one
kill is "free" exp, I'd hate to see "non-free" exp.

Your time would be far more profitably spent in a regular
exp group, killing light blues at no real risk.

Doing something that makes you *less* exp than the laziest
form of regular hunting hardly seems like an "exploit" in
my book.

Furthermore, they wouldn't *need* a zillion HP if
they just kicked the crap out of you like the portal Scions
do.  So I have to wonder if they were given a zillion
HP specifically because they were designed not to strike
back.
