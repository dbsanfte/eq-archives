<snipped for brevity, and because my newsreader sucks at quoting text...>

While they are not the same game, you CAN make comparisons.  "Hard" mobs
for the soloer in EQ2 ("orange cons"), are equivilent to EQ1 "light blue"
mobs in terms of xp gained (roughly).  This is speaking as a level 20.  I
don't know for a fact, but I have gathered that that holds true at later 
levels as well.

The difference in difficulty between the two is like night and day.  And 
the kicker is, unless it is a group-class (indicated by the 1 or 2 chevrons)
mob, it will drop _NO_ loot, other than "junk".  ("Sellable" loot in EQ2
comes from chests, which only drop from group-class encounters).

So... About 500 challenging solo encounters at 20 will get me to 21.  And I
will have nothing to show as far as loot is concerned.

Before their big monkey-fuck (i.e. "Teh Big Patch", and the one that preceded
it), you _COULD_ solo double chevron group-class greens.  They were not easy.
They took a long time to kill.  Death was a possibility, and you would have to
work for the kill.  BUT, you would get 1%-ish xp per kill, and the chance at
a chest dropping.  They ramped group cons up so much that they are impossible 
to solo.

I guess what I would have liked is a challenge, but one that pays off.  As a 
level 20 soloer in EQ2 I was pidgeon-holed into killing mobs which I knew I
could kill, I knew would give minimal xp, and I knew would drop no "sellable"
loot.  At least in EQL the loot tables were random, but in EQ2 no chest =
nothing for j00.  

I'm not knocking the game itself.  They designed a very nice universe.  Just
not for those who like to play alone, or don't have time to LFG all day.  I 
could get lost in tradeskilling if the adventuring was half-way immersive as a 
soloist.

To sum up....

EQ1 - light blue (very easy), minimal xp, you might get a drop.
EQ2 - orange (difficult), minimal xp, you don't get nuffin'.

EQ2 mobs don't drop coins, either.  Ever.
