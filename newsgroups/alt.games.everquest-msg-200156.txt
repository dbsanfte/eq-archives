Well following the friendly advice that i've found here (thanks
people) by using the consider function and devoting 3hrs (2hrs
yesterday & 1 hr today) i've made it to 6th level, hopefully this
means that im back on track. yet again i apologize for the phrasing of
this inital post, in the future i will try be more careful about the
wording of the posts i post here.

Thanks again and have a nice day.
