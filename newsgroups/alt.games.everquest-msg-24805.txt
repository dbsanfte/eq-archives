I'm not talking about the fact that warrens loot rules will keep high
level players out, I'm talking about the fact that if they make some
decent equipment, but make it no drop, they are basically making it
impossible for a high level character to get that item just because
they've been playing the game to long.  

This I'd have a problem with.
