	No.  They are EASIER because time spent in those areas will produce
experience far faster than time spent in terrestrial zones.  The fact that the
planes have a "you must be this tall to ride this attraction" sign does not
make them more difficult.

	If there is nothing to lose, there is no risk.  Realistically, what can be
lost grinding experience in EQ is 4% of the experience deducted for a death.

|Ask that level 55 shaman if there's risk in EQ, you might be
|surprised at his answer.

	His answer is irrelevant if it's wrong.

	Every class has a certain number of AA points they need, and anything past
that is gravy.  Once you get all the "necessary" AAs, you will get bored.  It
will happen.  It's basic human nature.  It may even happen earlier than that
if the tedium is sufficient.  Technically Venture "needs" to reach level 65
and top out Combat Fury and Fury of the Ages, but frankly, at this point it's
about as interesting doing that as watching paint dry.  More fun to play
Rangergrrl on Test.

|We aren't gonna give up on

|trains and laugh as we decimate them, sounds like a lot of fun.

	For about a week.
