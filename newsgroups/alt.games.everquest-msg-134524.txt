 Top posting in USENET *used* to be de rigeur, but in recent years the
bottom posting fanatics seem to have taken the lead and bullied everyone 
into their way of thinking.
 
 Like you, I also prefer to follow a thread without having to scroll 
down every post to read the reply since I *just* read the post seconds 
ago and pretty much can remember what was said. *IF* on the rare
occasion when I do forget the few words of wisdom in the previous post 
and get confused, I can always shft-p back and re-read it EVEN without 
quotes.
 
 Sheesh, I remember USENET even before we COULD quote text.
