No, Faned.

The three lines were *not relevent*. They should have been snipped
from the very first post of mine; they were only left in because the
post wasn't long enough to make me trim.

How stupid do you have to be to not get this? I was replying to
Jennaii. Not the poster she was replying to. Get it through your
fucking idiot skull. Once again, what Jennaii said:

>> >> >> >> >> >At 57 my ranger always dual wield, only changing
>> >> >> >> >> >to a slow weapon if I get agro.  

My response to that:


>> >> >> >> >> 2h > dual wield, unless your 1handers are very much superior to your
>> >> >> >> >> two hander... but given how common WMBS or windblade are that doesn't
>> >> >> >> >> seem likely (it takes ssra weapons or better to outdamage either for a

Pretty simple, to anyone who isn't a complete DUMBASS. See that
"your"? Remember, if you are able to, that I am talking to Jennaii?
Think that maybe, just maybe, it was therefore *meant* for Jennaii?

I'm insulting you because you're a dumbass. I know you won't back
down, it gives me a chance to use your sorry ass as a punching bag
like we have in the past when you've been stupid.

You have once again failed to answer my post, Faned. How come you have
nothing of substance to argue with? From a logical standpoint, I've
completely owned you. You've lost so completely and utterly you should
be slinking away with your tail between your legs.

Unfortunately for you, I wasn't responding to that part of the post,
as context plainly shows.

And yet, you still managed to, because you STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT I
WASN'T TALKING TO THE OP. Most people would have figured that out from
the fact the attributions clearly show I was responding to Jennaii!

Bit beyond subliterates such as yourself, perhaps.

Figures. Nothing left, call em inane. That's you.

The ability to laugh at oneself is commendable, but your other major
flaws make up for it.

How come you still haven't answered my post with any content, Faned?
Is it because you know you were wrong and just can't admit it?
