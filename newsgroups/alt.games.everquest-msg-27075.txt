I've hit with a crippling blow for 350 odd but that is with 2hs weapon that
has a dam of 34 at 46th lvl, I'd imagine that at 60th 500dam can be
achieved. I can't imagine anyone hitting for 500 with a 1hder tho' At least
not a PC.

It's easier to make money and buy your equipment, imo, than it is to quest
for it. I hold some admiration for those that get their items the hard way.
I have always found the quickest way of making plat does not involve
levelling or getting any more than incidental exp.

You know you are playing EQ right because you are enjoying it, that's it.
I disagree about twinks, *most* people that twink themselves do not have an
attitude (assuming you don't ask them for spare equipment) but those that
get free equipment from friends can often get ahead of themselves and show
little respect for those going thru the game the first time with no help.
I see characters that are sub level 20 better equipped than my primary all
the time, I'm used to it,m

Nope, never compare yourself to others. There is no right way or wrong to
play this game. Just because you're not in full Dark Forge or in an Uber
Guild or level 50 in 21 days does not mean you're not playing the game right
or playing it well, you are playing at your own speed. I'd certainly look at
Flayed skin armour, the arms are a little low on AC but legs are good, the
boots have great stats (only 8ac tho)

Problem you are suffering is you are used to being a big fish in FA but you
have to start as a minow in EQ. You may or may not get to 60, if that is
what drives you then I'll say you will, it doesn't drive me, tho so I
couldn't care less, I am still enjoying EQ and that is all that really
matters to me, that and a full suit of Cobalt armour ;ï¿½)
