Points aren't reflected by how many people are in the group so people 
going LD shouldn't make any differance.  I'm guessing you're around 
level 50, you will get more points the higher level you are at 65 you'll 
get 51 points per adventure, provide your group is an adverage of 63 or 
higher.  I don't think the points jump up much until you hit 60 although 
they do go up slowly.
