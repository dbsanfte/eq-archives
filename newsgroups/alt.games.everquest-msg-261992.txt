No graveyard but you can end the instance to get your corpses to pop
outside. You can also leave that way so you don't have to worry about
fighting your way through repops to get to an exit. It will kick you
out of the zone a minute or two after you end the instance so no major
wait there. 

>c) Are they for 3-6 players like LDoN ?
Yes

>d) How to get the names to spawn.

At least with the instances I've seen so far, there seem to be
specific placeholders for the named.
