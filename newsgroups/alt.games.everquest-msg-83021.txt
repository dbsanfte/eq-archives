	The FRSS haste was under 10%, and probably closer to 5%.  This according
to multiple parsings over at the Glade.

	Every time a new haste item enters the game, the pharmers exaggerate its
haste level so as to milk the gullible.  This time was no exception.

	The only real 'mistake' with the pirate skeletons was the spawn time, and
perhaps the EB item.  (I got one of those and sold it for 2K fairly quickly,
which wass probably less than it was worth at the time, and definitely less
with the spawn removed.)
