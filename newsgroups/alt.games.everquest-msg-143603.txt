I fail to see how your message is a reply to mine.  Top
posting makes it harder to tell, but then so would
bottom posting, what you really need to do is go in
and reply to the portions of the post you think relevant...
or in this case, back up the thread till you find someone
as the OP of a thought you want to respond to.

The subthread you have latched onto follows the thought
"clerics are needed in groups because of rez"
to which I replied, in essence "nope, you want a
cleric to rez you, but he doesn't have to be in
your group to do that, any more than a druid has
to be in your group to port you or a necro to
summon your corpse"

Your response, summed up, is "Druids getting limited
CHeal is going to make clerics less desirable"... sure
a perfectly valid thought for this thread... but not to
the little sub-portion of the thread you've latched on to.
