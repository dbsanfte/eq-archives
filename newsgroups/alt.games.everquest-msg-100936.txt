Greater Voceration summoned with a Staff of Mastery maxes
at level 49.  (48 without).  At that, I still see decent
damage output with the mob being as much as 7-8 levels higher
than my Vocerate pet.  So, projecting forward, a GV pet 
should still be effective on mobs upwards of level 56.  It's
those epic mobs at 60+ where poor Goner might as well spit
at them.
