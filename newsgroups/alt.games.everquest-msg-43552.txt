Doubt it.
Gaming is the one area where the hardware dictates the pace of
software cycle.

When manufacturers of the latest and greatest video cards start
punching out WinXP drivers 3 to 6 months before Win9X drivers
(assuming they even BOTHER with Win9X drivers), you'll see gaming
platform of choice migrate pretty fucking fast to the XP.

Again doubt it.
If you're running Win2K right now, the incentive to move to XP is
pretty low.

But for Win9X users the reasons for upgrading is a bit more
compelling.

If history is any indicator, you would lose that bet.

BTW, you're aware that XP has a "compatibility" mode on a program by
program basis right?  You can select a program and have it run in
"Win9X" compatibility mode--XP will attempt to emulate Win9X for that
program alone.
