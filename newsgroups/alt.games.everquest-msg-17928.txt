You'll find both classes most welcome in a group, so too with shamans, as
they are the healing classes and often the most in demand in many zones. At
high levels the cleric tends to be more sought after for a combination of
reasons I wont go into detail about. otoh druid are probably more desired in
a group below 39, or 49 maybe. Resurrect is a hard act to beat, in terms of
party desirability.

If you want to be able to solo, then dont play a cleric. Its not impossible,
but a druid does it much much easier. Youll also be able to sart making some
money at 29 with druid port, while a cleric has to wait for 39 for the first
xp res spell. Also its easier to find people wanting ports.
