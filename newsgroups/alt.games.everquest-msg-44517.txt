He's born with the ability in him. Otherwise warriors could go to a guild
and "learn" magic. It's not a racial skill, but some races just can't be
born with certain "skills". Trust me, it works. It explains why an wizard
can't learn to heal and a cleric can't learn to port. It's just not there.

Euhm, I had a sort of village idiot in mind. Everyone likes him, but he just
"doesn't fit in".

Not sure what you're trying here, but you're saying exactly what I meant.
He's a HIE mage, raised by dwarfs, but whatever he says, he's still a HIE
mage. He just claims he's a dwarf and despite his intelligence he refuses to
grasp the idea that he isn't a dwarf.

Ever read Discworld? Think Captain Carrot.


Being GM for a few years let people think things over a few times :)
