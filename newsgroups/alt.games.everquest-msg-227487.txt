So in the end your objection is that it's not fair that people with more
disposable income in the real world have more options in the fantasy world
we inhabit? Is this the essence of the objection? There's no assertion that
there's an actual negative impact on the economy, just a sense that it's not
a good thing because wealthy people will have an advantage?
