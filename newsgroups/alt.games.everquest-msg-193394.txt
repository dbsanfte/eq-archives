"Aggro" is not the same as "kill-credit" (i.e. total damage).  For
example, a zero-damage Stun spell gets a fair bit of agro but zero
kill-credit, while a Manaburn gets almost zero agro and (possibly)
an enormous amount of kill-credit.  Apparently kill-credit is going
to the DS'd character now, wonder where the agro is going.  If they
are assigning the agro to the DS'd char that would be a bit of a
bone tossed to the Warriors, as they can take more pounding than
anybody else.
