Anit-semitism has never really been defeated, especially in Europe.  It gets
imported over here to the universites, and spreads there.  In some middle
east countries, they even regard Hitler as a hero (fun stuff you can find on
www.memri.org), and praise him for killing so many jews.  In other words, we
may have defeated the Nazi party, but we haven't defeated the ideology.
