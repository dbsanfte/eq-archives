So having to zone out every 5 minutes because of trains is ok?   Its
reasonable I should have to keep doing that so every losers train doesn't
kill me?

Its not a dungeon, theres no paths and corridors and specific sides to
train.

Its an outdoor zone where you can setup camp <wherever> you want.  Theres no
right or wrong way to train, no place you can avoid to not hit the trains

Ditto Prexus.  And in karnors, you would still hear many times daily "WTF

I don't think you have any chance of escaping a golem, spider or vassels
that are in summon mode.   These mobs hit for around 500, they stun
frequently (especially from behind) and they get buggy pathing inside the
castle, so they don't follow you making each summoning a few steps closer to
the zone, they summon you back to the castle every time.

PoV has big LoS issues too (mobs mending and wurm-style warps) when the mob
can't see you too.

Like i said, nowhere is safe,   Yeah, damn those numbskulls thinking they

Like I said, theres no set path you can take to hit/avoid people.  And TRAIN
TO ZONE doesn't really help much, when you have no idea which direction its
coming from, its proximity to you, or where its heading to

But its still YOUR problem, not mine.  When I fuck up (be it a bad pull,
late heal, or pop/mob hitting for way mre, refusing to slow etc) its me that
pays for that mistake, not the rest of the zone

The wastelands are like a secluded part of the zone, they arent in a train
pull path

GY's are pretty laggy anyway.  I zoned in with my shaman and as the screen
loaded, 3 vessels started whacking him.  The first thing i did was attempt
to run to the zone (a big gravestone in the corner of gy).  Video lag from
shitloads of corpses plus a stun = death in less than 5 seconds

Most couldnt give a crap which way they run, whatever the shortest to the
zone to ensure safety, usually!  Not only did the mobs run through groups on
the way, they will also path back an_unknown_preset_way adding further
damger to the groups!

Your not losing them because of me.  Your losing them because of your OWN
fuckup.  Be it by human error or bad luck, its your problem, deal with it.
Don't inflict it upon the rest of the zone.

Oh I know a lot of people do it.  Even if the majority did it though, it
wouldnt stop me calling you a selfish prick for doing it to me.

1 in 20 isn't what Im talking about.   Im refering to incompetent morons who

So your "warning" consists of direction, starting position, current
location, mobs involved, and destination zone?  Shouting "TRAIN!!!!!^&!^&!"
is a meaningless, no, its a USELESS line of spam on the screen when said
alone

No, I just made a mental note when I felt it necessary.  Its good to recall
if somebody is a rude obnoxious trainer when it comes to deciding who's
group you will join, whether or not you really want to help total_stranger
with an epic, whether you veto them or not for guild application.

/elitist mode on

E.g.. in recent months if I were in Seb or Velk, I was sacrificing my exp by
a huge amount by grouping (and im sure boosting their exp considerably, in
comparison to the usual people you find in a pickup group)

I've helped on probably 200+ epic quests now, and countless other quests
(monk cleric and shaman bring a lot to a raid/quest imo, at least the cleric
and shaman do)

If I recall you being a nooby annoying dick who trains every 10 seconds...
well you'd be lucky to even get a response when asking me one of the 2 above

Why?  It starts with Oasis, they move onto Omen, then DL and KC to complete
their training!

Not necessarily.  I can think of a lot of people who could be in a zone with
me, and there wouldnt be train warnings every 5 mins.  Most of my guild, for
starters.

Well what I meant is I group and raid with people with the know-how and
skill to pull/kill effectively, act responsibly/mature, and effectively
handle adds without training to zone like a little girl.    At the
higher-end game, surely I should be able to expect the majority of people
are like that, and not just people in certain guilds

I ran to akheva the weekend, and im not exagerating here, there were at
least 30 mobs chilling at the zone-line in ME, waiting for some poor sucker
to try getting into Akheva
