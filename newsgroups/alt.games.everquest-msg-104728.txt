I think a lot of the reasoning from the other side is so many people
chose druid for their ease of play perks - easy soloing, sow,
teleport, etc. The penalty for reaping the rewards of convenience is
decreased abilities.

In other words, if you wanted more effectiveness in a group or a raid,
you should have picked a class that *has* that effectiveness even
though it lacks the conveniences offered by the druid.

A case of wanting to have your cake and eat it too.

I say that as someone who has a druid for my highest level character
(60), by the way, so it applies to me too, though I certainly don't
think druids need anything further than what we have.
