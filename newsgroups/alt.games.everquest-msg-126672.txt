Well, the one can directly impact the other... especially after a night of 
heavy drinking...

}Speaking as one Jew, eat whatever you want.  

Well, that's all well and good.  But when did Jesus say it?  Sanjian says 
he doesn't know... does anyone know?  Speaking for myself, I'd probably be 
ostracized from the family if I didn't participate in the ritual 
squabbling over the bacon.  (It's all fun and games until someone gets 
stabbed with a fork...)  But I'd still just like to know...  when did 
Christians get the go-ahead?  I've long theorized that the orignal 
proscription against pork had something to do with prevalence of 
trichnosis cases, so it's always had me curious.
