    You might be surprised. Using /betabuff and the GMs people could get
just about anything they wanted, so a lot of the high-end raiders used the
time to parse out weapon combinations and gear combinations to see what max
Time gear players will be like and how classes compare. There's already a
bit of controversy over one parse posted at Paladins of Norrath - a
self-buffed 65 PAL with near-full Time gear and AA's soloed Gorenaire (and
about three or four adds that wandered in over the course of the fight).
