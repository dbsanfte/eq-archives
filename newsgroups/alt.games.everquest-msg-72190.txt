Uh... yeah, I did forget that. Been awhile since I even took her out on the
town ;) Ok, so I was reading the thread about best solo class, and the
consensus seems to be that a ranger does damn well on his/her own. Early in
the game's life, I did try a ranger once and found that when I -did- finally
get out of the tree town, I could rarely ever find my way back! Add that to
falling off the damn loft pretty regularly (this drew a huge laugh from
those standing around, but pissed me off immensely), and you might
understand why I gave her up after 3 levels. I also tried a SK and had
problems because of being a troll. I know, that sounds stupid, but in RL, I
hate and fear anything much more than a bathtub full of water. Trying to
hunt in the swamp just set my teeth on edge. So I could be a SK somewhere
else and not have to worry about the swamp, plus sell those langsaxes for
some plat maybe... huh...

/em walks away scratching her head
