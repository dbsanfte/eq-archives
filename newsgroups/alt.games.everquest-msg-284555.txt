Holy cow! Good call. Filtering out just the level 1's made a significant 
difference. Hard to believe that half of all the characters shown on 
EQPlayers are level 1.

I've since found out, however, that this database is not completely 
accurate. There is evidently an option the player can set to prevent 
their data from being included in the EQPlayers rankings and, possibly, 
query results. Aside from that, I have seen claims of other various 
inaccuracies that may or may not be directly related to that as well.
