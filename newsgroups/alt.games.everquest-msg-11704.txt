	This is compensated for somewhat by the fact that the
Everfrost newbie areas are all white mountains, so it's pretty easy to
see your way around even at night.

	*That* is counteracted by the fact that the newbie portions of
Everfrost are a frickin' maze.  :)

	But in general, of the three night-blind races, Barbarians
probably have the easiest time of it if you're a brand new player to
the game.  Halas is very small when compared to Qeynos or Freeport, so
even if it's hard to see in the dark, there's not a lot of chances to
get completely lost and turned around.
