You know, even tho clerics *can* heal for 6000HP (i doubt its going to
happen much...) in a raid environment (and were talking raids here
remember), the cheal rotation and backup heals means that each cheal only
ever does 2k or so anyway....  what your suggesting, would effectively give
druids a faster cast "complete heal" then clerics..

And as much as it would aid my guild (lets face it who cant use more
clerics?) i am TOTALLY against the idea of giving druids a heal like this.

Theres no way in hell your class is that broken as to need this (and I don't
even agree its broken at all)
