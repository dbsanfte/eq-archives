Every zone is a compete waste of time.  The entire game is made to be
a complete waste of fucking time.  At one time it was designed to be
fun too, but that got cut from the Vision so they could concentrate on
making it the complete waste of fucking time that it is today.

Then they will take all the new time-wasting techiniques they have
learned, distill them in some dirty underground laboraty where they
torture monkies for their sick experiments, and inject them into the
shit biscuit know as EQ2.  So we can experience
"Bang-your-head-against-the-fucking-keyboard-because-the-
pain-is-better-than-the-boredom-while-laughing-insanely-wishing-you-were-
fucking-dead" waste of time(tm).
I don't know about you, but were do i reserve my copy.
