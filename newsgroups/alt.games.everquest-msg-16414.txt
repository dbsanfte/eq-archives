Enchanter would be *that* much of an improvement over the shaman, 
depending on level. My original statement was that if you have 5 monks, 
it's worth to replace one with the enchanter and have 4 buffed monks.
But, theoretically, 2 max-hasted monks will outdamage 3 non-hasted monks 
(after about level 44), if that was your question
