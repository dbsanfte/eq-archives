There are three different coffins.

For Necros:
At level 12, lesser summon corpse uses the cheap stackable coffins, only
summons corpses of players up to level 34?
At level 39, Summon Corpse uses the expensive, nonstackable coffins.
At level 57, Conjure Corpse uses the less expensive stackable coffins.
(About half the price of the nonstackable ones)

For SKs:
At level 25, Lesser Summon Corpse.
At level 51, Summon Corpse.
They don't get Conjure Corpse.
