Who knows... but i've met 2 people from my town just wandering around EQ
once. One of them was in my team. We just happened to ask each other where
we were from..  he happens to live about 4 miles away from me. I also have
about 4 friends who play EQ who live near me and those friends know more
friends who play EQ who live around here. EQ is pretty popular, and my town
isn't even that big.. well the University of California, Santa Barbara
(UCSB) is in my town. Decatur is a pretty large city compared to where I
live. It's cool to have locals play on your same server.
