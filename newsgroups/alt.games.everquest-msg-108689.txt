Hate to break it to ya, numbnuts, but the same thing will happen in
nearly every other newsgroup out there. There's a reason for it: It's
an unecissary waste of space.

Maybe if you start CONTRIBUTING to this newsgroup rather than crawling
out of your shitpile now and then just to wave your dick around, you'd
be seen as something more than a snivelling, worthless little
schoolyard bully. Not even a bully, the little toady that stands
behind the bully yelling insults then runs away with his tail between
his legs like a little pussy if the bully gets beaten.
