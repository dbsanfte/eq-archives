The effect of strength on damage output is minimal.  Very large
gains in str will increase your damage output by 1-3%.

People have logged their damage output on thousands of hits, and the
histogram looks appoximately like -

  *          *
  *          *
  *    **    *
  *   ****   *
  *  ******  *
  ***************


The first spike is your minimum damage
(this is 1 unless you're a melee high
enough for your primary hand damage 
bonus to kick in - 28ish)

The last spike is the so-called Magic Number,
this is 2*weapon damage + damage bonus
(1 until your damge bonus starts going up)

Your max damage (those outliers on the
right) is what strenght effects, but 
their are so few of them, that boosting
your max damage doesn't do much for your
average damage.

The sad fact is that most stats have 
very little impact on combat, a 
fact the shaman community (the masters 
of stat buffs) discovered through much
log parsing.  (resulting in much 
gnashing of teeth.
