It would, in fact, pretty much require precisely that. Everquest is
based on DirectX; to convert it to Mac play, the best bet would be to
convert the entire game to OpenGL (I will note that this would not be a
Bad Thing(tm) for the Windows side as well, more than likely). However,
the cost / benefit of doing so - which would mean, in essence, replacing
the whole game for all players on all platforms (now there's a patch I
wouldn't want to download) - compared to the cost / benefit ratio of
releasing more content for the existing DirectX-based game means that
opening up the game to Mac users doesn't make any business sense. Yes,
there are several million Mac users out there, me amongst them; I
suspect we would *all* have to play Everquest for a year to make this a
break-even proposition. The developers only have so many artists,
programmers and so on; their time is better spent on things likely to
make the greatest profit for the company. I don't like it (any more than
I liked buying what amounts to the World's Most Expensive Nintendo
Machine to play EQ), but I do understand it.
