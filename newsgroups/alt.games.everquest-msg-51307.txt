Actually, it wasn't the person who got the real goodie who was complaining.
Most people didn't get anything and the 25 or 30 who did got an AC+1, WIS+2
ring.  I think that's what they were complaining about.  I wasn't expecting
to get anything.  I was already wearing 2 wis+2 rings but now I have one
that adds 1 ac and 1 charge of greater healing.  If I had only gotten to see
the fireworks after, I would have been satisfied, but I actually got to
participate.  Of the 2000 or so on each server, how many can say that?  But,
apparently, some people are more interested in loot.  Getting a 45 AC
anything at my level seems kinda like cheating. hehe
