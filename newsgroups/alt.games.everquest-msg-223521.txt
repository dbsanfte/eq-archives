Latest version of DX, all drivers up-to-date, nothing in the background 
that hasn't been running for the last year.  Three machines all affected 
in exactly the same way, all with slightly different configs, only 
affected since the last patch.

However, I wasn't looking for a fix, just adding my experience of the 
same issues to the thread.  In my experience, problems like this go away 
in the next patch.

It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying.
