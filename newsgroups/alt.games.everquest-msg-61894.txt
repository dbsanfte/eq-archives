My human necro is not KOS to either the dwarfs on Sister's Isle, or the
dwarfs on the docks at BB. (Rode the boat past there and conned them.) I
think your faction might be ok, but tread carefully. I may have gotten a
good con simply because I was on the boat. Not sure.

If you kill orcs, you'll trash your faction in Neriak, which you don't
want to do. I've had to go there already for several of my spells which
were not available in the Freeport tunnels. You might want to look up BB
quests and Kaladim quests on Allakhazam to see if there's any you can do
for better faction.

No. You either have to bind yourself, or go into Kaladim or GFey to be
bound by somebody else. I'd reccomend GFey since the whole damn zone is
bindable. You can just get a bind right across the zone line then run
back in to BB.
