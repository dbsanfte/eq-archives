Slightly cheaper casting, or slightly faster mana regen... not really 
what I have in mind.  In the long run, these things add up, but I'm just 
looking at blowing a few points now, and hoping for a splashy 
interesting effect off of them.

For an example, my cleric, faced with the same dilemna, took an AA (I 
forget the name) which redistributes damage over the group, so everyone 
has the same amount of damage taken.  This is a fabulous little trick, 
working as a near instant near Cheal with absolutely NO aggro (you won't 
even take a faction hit if this is the only "heal" you use.)  And its 
nothing like anything else my cleric can do with any spell or item I've 
ever heard of.  Cheap, effective, different; thats a really nice AA.

The reason I'm thinking in terms of this suspend pet thing is that it 
would potentially mean instantly having a replacement pet available 
regardless of my mana situation, and it would also mean I could invis up 
to travel.  Trouble with this logic is, A) its more expensive than just 
blowing the spare points I have; B) the first level of the ability only 
preserves the pet, not the gear and buffs, so the job's only half done. 
  Full Suspend would mean even more effort getting aa's to get the 
effect.  SO I suspect that Suspend isn't the "killer app" I'm looking for.

Dunno what it takes to get the Discipline deal, but that would be a 
great deal of use in a raiding situation... I doubt I'll be raiding 
before hitting 65 though, if ever.

Splendid
