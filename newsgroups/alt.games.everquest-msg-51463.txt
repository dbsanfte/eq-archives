The more I think about this, it's going to be very class-dependant.  A
monk is going to have a much easier time than a warrior, and a mage is
going to have an easier time than a monk.  I'm not sure where a bard
fits in the equation, but I think I could get basic gear in one good
play session.  I'm assuming I still have access to my songs, so I
would kill enough newbie mobs to buy basic instruments (a couple plat
maximum) and head to Rathe Mtns at about 5am EST, and charm-kite or
chant-kite any HG I could get my hands on.  Within a couple of hours I
should have enough money to buy a set of lambent armor, and couple
decent weapons auctioning in EC.  At this point, I should have enough
AC to head to Guk, CT, or SolB and solo some of the easier rooms to
get items for use or sell.  After a day or two of this, I would expect
to be in good enough shape to actually start looking for groups in KC
for bard weapons, and maybe even a piece of SS.  
It would be somewhat more difficult to try and do it without buying
anything in an auction zone, since I don't think I'm using a single
item that I didn't get myself or through my guild.  I think the last
gear I bought was my SS gloves almost a year ago.  Actually, I guess
the best way to get decent gear without buying it would be to tag
along on a couple of Hate raids, since most folks already have imbrued
or better, and armor is always rotting there.  As a bonus I could get
a decent (better than SSOY at least) weapon or two there.  The hard
part is deciding when you've accomplished your goal.  I doubt I'd be
able to every completely replace the gear I have now, just because
several pieces are no-drop rare drops off of rare or contested spawns.
I would guess that I could get up to 850AC or so with servicable (8/24
or better) weapons within a week.  I think it would take a hell of a
lot longer to get that final 175AC or so, to get good instruments, and
to get weapons that are worth anything.
