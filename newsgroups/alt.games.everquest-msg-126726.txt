Veering back onto the thread topic here.  A guildmate lost some items, and
contacted a GM via email to see about getting them restored.  The GMs
response was, and I quote "we have no record of a character named XXXXX on
the Erollisi Marr server".  Admittedly, her character is only level 22 right
now, but, well, being that I have grouped my twinks with her, I'm pretty
sure she does exist on the server.  The GM did spell her name correctly.
