In this case yes, because based on the guys message in that other forum
and the fact that he spent 500 days in eq I do find that dorkish in
nature.

I would hardly call this a quandry, I don't care if you guys think of me
as a noob or a guy who has also played too much (dork).  I am not going
to sit and try to come up with a balance where you guys will approve of
my play time or something.   I'll post my play time and you can take it
from there.

Again there is one thing I know of this guy (which you do not even know
about me) - he has played 500 days of EQ - that is simply nuts.
