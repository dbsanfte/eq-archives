Killed him last night actually.

We do fight him at the wall (pull him to the bunker).   The problem is, it
only takes one person to get agro (so he turns) and his next knockback sends
you out of the bunker.   (not saying he is a tough mob, its just a pain when
your avater snared and knock-backed, to get back to the raid)

I remember the first time I killed him... uberguild_03 came to kill him
after our scheduled PoF raid (back in the days of rotations and calendars),
and I stayed to fight it with them.. they fought it near where he roams, and
I swear it was the biggest zerg you've ever seen.

Wipe wipe wipe.. he finally dropped when there were 85 people in the zone
(40 being the guild in question whos rotation raid it was), every caster
bound in there to keep zerging him on death.

Last night, 41 people started, and at the end of the fight, 40 people were
still standing (no mid-fight rezzes)
