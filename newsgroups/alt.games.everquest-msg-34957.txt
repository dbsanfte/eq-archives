Subject: How do I raise my faction at Grobb?

Does anyone know how I can raise my faction at Grobb? (I hope im getting this
city right but its the city that is directly south of the Southern Desert of Ro
and that swamp south of it. Is that the troll city or the ogre city? The one Im
thinking about is south of Ro)

I tried to go there once, and they killed me so I was wondering, is there any
way i can improve my faction there so I can explore that city? Thank you
