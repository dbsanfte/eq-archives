I recently purchased a GForce3 card to replace my older Voodoo card.  The
speed increased dramatically, but the graphics of certain items are very
odd.  For instance, the appearance of chain / ring style armor seems to
"swim", kind of a blurring pattern....not horrible, but rather annoying in
external views.  I tried GForce's version of their anti-aliasing, and the
graphics became very unstable, and had to be turned off again.

Just wondering, since I'm not altogether familiar with the GForce card yet,
are there some settings that can be manipulated to remedy this?  I have the
most recent drivers for it *I think*, version 21.something, came out
recently.  I tried using both 16 and 32 bit color modes within the game,
same situation.  Any hints are appreciated!
