Obvious you say?

As I said, I'm only L23 (with my necro), but consider the following sequence
of events:

1. pull with darkness
2. /pet attack
3. begin casting DoT
4. pet closes distance and engages MOB
5. DoT lands
6. spell recovery time is met
7. begin casting Fear
8. fear lands
9. cast 2nd DoT or other spell of choice...

What's the elapsed time between 4 and 8?  6 seconds?  10 seconds? The pet is
killed in 6 seconds?  In my admittedly limited experience, if the MoB is so
much more powerful than your best pet that it kills it in 6 seconds, your
fear prolly won't stick anyway and you're likely doomed.
