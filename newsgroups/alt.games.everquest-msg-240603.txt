Fine... the rules wouldn't apply to you if you chose to break them...

At last :)

I finally see where you are coming from. And I'll even admit that from
that perspective it makes sense, and is even reasonable. 

That said, I still totally disagree with you.

I don't agree that items are your equipment. Your PC, desk, chair,
ISP, etc are. Your characters gear is just part of the scoring system,
along with level and AAs and flags.. Buying gear isn't much different
than buying a higher score in any game, and about as legitimate.

The accumulation of equipment *IS* playing the game. In baseball you
bring your uniform to the game... in EQ the uniform your character
wears represents what you've done in the game... 

You are arguing that there is a game-within-the-game and that you
*have* to not only equip yourself to play eq (by having a fast PC
etc), but you must equip your avatar *inside* eq to play some inner
game... but that's simply bogus. There is no inner game... equipping
your avatar *is* the game.

They're spending pp not $$. And they've got pp to blow, because at
65th 100+ AAs its not that hard to come by.

Nope. That's within the the rules of the game. Some people may look
disparaging on it, myself included to an extent, but you would never
see me suggest that they are cheating and should be banned for it.

I disagree about it being practical. I also note that a 'guild' has no
use for $$, while an individual does... if I told my guild we were
going to raid XX and that I was going to sell drop Y to Z. They'd be
like, 'and I'm showing up why? How does this further my character *or*
the guild??'

 It would be a tough sell in any guild to get them to raid so you
could sell stuff. And even if you split the cash...even 2k divided
50ways is a lousy 40 bucks... I'm not going to log in to a game,
organize a raid for a shot at a rare drop that *might* net me 40lousy
bucks if something rare drops...

But even so... selling characters is essentially bulk transfer of
no-drop items. And it goes on all the time.

Even 30 minutes is a hassle for a no-drop rare-drop.

Except its against the rules. We could also make travelling in
basketball 5 steps instead of 3 ... the rules of a game are always, to
an extent, arbitrary.
