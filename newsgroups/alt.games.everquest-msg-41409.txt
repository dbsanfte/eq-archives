on the dark side....  If you go after their family, you have made them
feel the pain and angst you have for their actions. (yeah I'm putting
it more into context with the present issue rather than your suggested
situation).
If someone rapes my child.... I will hurt them... brutally, and
slowly... most likely I would attack their genitalia.
If someone kills my people, family, friends,.... I feel it is only
proper to return the pain... but dubbed... not just equal..
That way they know not to do it again.


Someone hits you... Hard. 
Do you just wait, hit them just as hard, or hit them double as hard.

DOUBBLE as hard (they will remember it)
