Was just over at EQPlayers, and queried players of each of the classes. 
These counts should be accurate +- 10, as I just took the number of pages 
of results and multiplied that times 20 results per page - 10 to estimate 
the last page result count. Also, I did the math in my head and rather 
quickly, so this tally is absolutely for entertainment purposes only. :P

Bard          -  5710
Cleric        -  9430
Druid         -  8790
Enchanter     -  7770
Magician      -  7270
Monk          -  5750
Necromancer   -  8650
Paladin       -  5490
Ranger        -  5430
Rogue         -  5110
Shadow Knight -  6450
Shaman        -  7910
Warrior       - 10210
Wizard        -  5490

That's some 99460 characters created (+- some 140).

Wow. That's a lot of warriors.
