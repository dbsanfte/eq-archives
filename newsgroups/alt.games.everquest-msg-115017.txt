Back when I first started playing, I had a level 7 half elf paladin on a
different server than all of my friends (shared account, not enough char
slots to try out new characters, semi-long story).  Anyways, I ran him from
Freeport to Surefall Glade without a Sow (took the
Rivervale/Misty/Runnyeye/Xorbb route also btw).  In Surefall (back before
soulbinders) I shouted for a bind, but didn't get one (I was a serious
newbie back then, didn't know who could cast bind, there was a 28 druid in
SFG at the time).  Went back outside, was talking to one of the Millers,
pulled the old "Hail Baobob Miller"  "Why greetings, would you like to know
how to make bearhide [gloves], [boots] or a fine [cloak]?", but halfway
through "what boots" he attacks me.  oops, no enter.  Shouted for help back
in EC, a nice high level  (to me) druid ported me to NK and SoWed me, but I
died to a cyclops in WK before I got to Qeynos Hills, that corpse went the
way of /rot (though not without a bit of a fight, like trying to /consent a
new human druid to loot the corpse, I was so proud of that vendor bought,
*8pp*  longsword =(  )
