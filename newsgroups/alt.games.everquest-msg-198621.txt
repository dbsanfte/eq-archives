>Is it always like this or have I just run into a busy patching time?  

Well, you've actually started EQ at a bad patching time...  :(  

Approximately once every few months we get a mother of a patch...  then you
have the obligatory patch of the patch...  then after a day or so you have the
always expected patch of the patch of the patch...

Then you have people still getting upset and complaining because even the patch
to the third power hasn't fixed what their problems were but Sony generally
tunes out and just adds those complaints to the list of stuff to patch next
time.  LOL

Also, any time a new expansion comes out there is a patch from hell as well...

In the meantime, while the patch is going on, read this group, surf the net, or
get some sunlight...  hehe  :)

We understand and we are here for you.
