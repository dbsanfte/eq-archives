Hi, can anyone tell me as a human necro do I need to worry too much about
killing orcs in oasis? I heard they will effect faction with the warriors in
Neriak - I have been building up my dark elf faction but dont really care if
I am kos to that one guild. Also someone told me that even though I am a
necro I am kos in Overthere as well? is this true?
Thanks.
