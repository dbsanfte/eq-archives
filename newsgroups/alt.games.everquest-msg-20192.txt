I've been through 30, 35, 40, and 45. My key was to ignore the xp bar
and have fun. Do quests, explore, max out skills, upgrade your gear,
work on trade skills etc. It took longer to get throught the hell
level, but it seemed shorter.

Post hell levels are the ones to watch out for since the death penalty
is more server. 31, 36, 41, 46,... is were you want to hunt safe
spawns for xp only.
