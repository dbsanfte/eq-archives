So I should be expected to be screwed out of loot because the cleric chose
to group with people not willing to pay for their symbol yesterday?

If a cleric isn't assertive enough to make sure they don't lose plat they
should have to eat the cost.  I give 'dots to my pickup group cleric if I
know loot's going to be sparse without being asked, but I don't think many
people do.

This is all regarding pick-up groups.  If a cleric regularly groups with
their guildies they should be taken care of when it comes to not eating the
loss.  The cleric would also say "nah, I'm good now...split the rest."
