Did you run the patcher to patch the test server files first? That is
how you get the new dx8.dll and some other files. Then enable the
dx8.dll. 

If you are crashing anyway:

try putting this in the eqclient.ini for now:

UseTnL=FALSE

If its still screwed.. its stuff that verant has to fix by tuesday and
quit worrying that its on your end.

I did manage to use direct x8 okay with my tnt 16 meg agp with the
same drivers you are probably using (21.83 or somehting) in the above
way. However my mouse is super slow in transparent inventory (velious)
with that dx 8 so I went back to 7.

To go back to using 7:

"** For those having problems logging in **

If you are having a problem that causes you to be kicked out of the
game after selecting "Play on line", there is a solution to this
problem.


Delete these files from your EverQuest directory:

bmpwad6.s3d
sky.s3d
gequip3.s3d
gequip3.wld


This should solve the problem.

However, if you find that you are still having the problem and you
have previously edited your eqclient.ini file in order to test out the
DX8 DLL, then you should be able to fix the problem by:

Edit the line in your EQClient.ini in your EQ directory from
"GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx8.DLL" to "GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx7.DLL".

"

I only had the gequip3.s3d and sky.s3d files for some reason so
deleted those, switched do dx7, and was fine as always again.
