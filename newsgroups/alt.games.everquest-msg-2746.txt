I have the problem on my K-6 with an ATI Rage. The "Unable to get player name"
error and the subsequent lines shown the original poster's log indicates that
EQ is unable to zone the character because it doesn't know which character to
zone. 
<WARNING: the following is a WAG>
I would say the problem is most likely with the network. Maybe the request for
the player's name is not being fulfilled quickly enough.
