I know what you were saying, and I'm telling you that between 50 and 60, for
most of the time a druid was our main healer, and often our only healer.
With an enchanter in the group to give her C2 and slow all of the mobs, we
were able to function in a dungeon environment, without any additional
downtime waiting for druid mana to regen.   It was pretty much all she could
do... that and epic DoT, if she wanted to stay good on mana... but she kept
up enough to keep us running, long before druids got CH.

Shaman slows are not that much better than enchanter slows.  And as I said,
our druid was enough to keep up.

If you need 660 healing on every member of the group at once, you were
probably in over your head already.  Evac instead and start again. Our
paladin generally did/does lay hands if emergency heals are needed, and uses
heal spells to "backup" our druid, so she could save mana.

Heh.  Not with us. ; )    Clerical support is an uncommon event for our
little group. ; )   Not all that many for us to choose from, and several are
on the /veto list, for being incompetent.

And none of us are stupid enough to suggest we spend a half hour zone
spamming for a cleric to come, just to save an extra 6% of the experence
lost.
