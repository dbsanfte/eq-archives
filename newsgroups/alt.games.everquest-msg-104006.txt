Very politically incorrect - I'm just big boned. And it's a Robe of the Lost
Circle - I'm on Rallos, so I wear no drop.
Reminds me of when my wife told me she wanted her boobs to be a bit bigger,
so I said wipe them with toilet paper every day.
Bullshit she said, what's the key to you? So I explained that it did wonders
for her arse. Ouch.
Enraged wife hits YOU for 957 points of damage.
