For my Paladin - a wrist item that makes him immune to all AoE spells, good
and bad, and that can neither be dropped nor destroyed.

For my Rogue - an item that allows him to do a monk-type Feign Death.

For my Shaman - an item that gives him minimum Dubious faction with all mobs
in the game.

For my Druid - an item that allows me to forage any type of meat / pelt /
non-magic body bits dropped by any creature in the zone.  (So I can go into
Perma, say, and forage dragon meat).

For my Necro - an item/spell that allows him to Animate Corpse.
