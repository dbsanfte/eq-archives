Nope, there is no MAY in the new naming policy.  Here it is, verbatim,
cut-n-pasted from the Sony site:

Customer Service will change a players last name if the player
requests a change provided that the player is level 20+ and either the
surname, or the combination of the first name and surname requested
does not violate the Naming Policy.

That is a WILL, not a MAY.  I have already done it.  Petition, wait
for guide to say he dont's have authority, wait for GM to contact you.
You can even just go without a surname.  You can't do it yourself, you
have to petition, and I'm sure the GMs will notice if you change once
a week.
Welcome to the new, kinder, gentler Verant, where they actually try to
keep customers fat and happy.
