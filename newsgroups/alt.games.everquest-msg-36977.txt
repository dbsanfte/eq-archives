From what I've heard from others on the subject of LinkDead is that if
it occurs prior to an agro, you are viewed by the MoBs as a neutral
NPC and left alone. If in the middle of a fight, the computer takes
over and finishes it if possible (assumming you were going to win in
the first place) leaving you with no exp or loot or dead because you
lost the fight.

Don't know if it works that way, but I have only died once from LD and
that was in the middle of a kite when my mana was almost gone.
