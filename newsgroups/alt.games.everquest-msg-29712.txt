There is nothing wrong with the Lake of Ill Omen for a druid or a Ranger til
at least lvl 33, lvls 28 and 29 were about the easiest I have ever done
anywhere with any character.  Use the snare dot... method described above
and you will be fine.  At these levels grouping for a druid is not needed
and will only slow you down.  Whoever told you the Lake was no longer good
after 26 or 27 gave you very bad information, actually that is when it
really begins to become interesting, just solo, dot/root and use tracing to
find your victims and you will be fine if you have the patience to hunt in
this manner.
