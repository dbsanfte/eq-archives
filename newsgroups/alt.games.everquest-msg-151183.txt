   Very, very true.  I make it a point to get beat on a bit each level,
to keep my defensive skill up, no matter what I am playing (granted, I
don't play intel casters).  Lenny and I were grouped the other night in
Skyshroud, with a well-played necro.  We got swarmed by 5 or so
lightcrawlers.  All dark blue.  I was the acting crowd control and, of
course, healer.  Through the whole thing, I always had at least one of
them beating on me.  The necro got agro 3 or 4 times.  I root parked,
and kept him with enough hitpoints not got the the new last name "'s
Corpse".  Lenny and Jojobar gamely whacked away, I healed them both as
needed, until all the bugs were dead.  We ended up a bit dazed, but
alive with a heap of bodies around us.  If any of us had panicked, even
a little bit, we ALL would have died.  Was glad for a maxed out
channeling skill also, of course.

   I'm a cleric.  I'm very responsible to whatever group I am in.  But
if I am in a party, even your party, and I hear a loud WHUMP in the
bathroom where Lenny is taking a shower, followed by a scream of pain, I
am leaving the group immediately, with no notice, and for no apparent
reason to anyone else playing the game.  In all likelihood, the computer
will have been turned off before the scream ends.

    Oh... yeah, I guess gating is different.  If I didn't hear the
WHUMP, and Lenny staggered into the room covered with blood asking me to
take him to the ER, I might gate to safety firs...  Naw.  Computer would
be instantly powered down.  Hmmm.  Maybe she likes her character more
than she does the people in her real life.  I could see _that_
happening, depressing as the thought might be.
   Btw, it would take something about this serious for me to not at
least type "OMG!  OMG!  GOTTA GO *NOW*".  But I would in all other
emergencies.  You know, something like my house catching on fire, or my
running out of wine.
