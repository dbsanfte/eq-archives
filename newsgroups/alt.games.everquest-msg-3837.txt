I think he was talking about OOT, which is a static spawn.  When I camped
the AC there (OOT), I observed for a bit invis.  The regular cylops will
walk off and despawn, permitting the next spawn to pop.  If someone is
nearby and no one is camping it, they have as much chance at nabbing him as
a person sitting there camping.  Tracking classes do well, because they will
see it from a ways off.  I *think* this adds to the rareity (sp?) of that
mob.

When I was determined to get my pair of jboots, I did it during time off
from work.  I logged on at 5am eastern when it was open (usually).  I camped
for about 6 hours and no luck, but good cash/gems.  I did it again the next
day for about 4 hours and he popped.  Now I complain it isn't as fast as my
druid buddy's sow, but still useful ;-)
