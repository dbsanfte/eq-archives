Some do. If you go to www.eqrangers.com they should list them.
Making them is easy enough though, again fletching guides on that website.

PC made ones will cost variable amounts but since everyone who can use
them can make the basic ones good enough to pull and most rangers will be
making their own good ones I'd be surprised if the mark up was huge on
your server. Also the fletch guides around tell ou how much they cost to
see what the mark up is.

Flight arrows are a vendor sold for about 1sp, Flight arrows are a longer
range vendor sold IIRC for about 1gp each.
