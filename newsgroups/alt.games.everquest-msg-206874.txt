Cor! That sounds like fun...Hmmm learning skills and helping others....Why
not do it in the real world, far more rewarding.

> Your not acutallly playing Star Wars.

No...so it would seem....So you get to live a virtual life as a plumber
doing charity work on Tatooine, restoring water supplies for Jawas...Sounds
great.

Uber Fag? The Gay Version of Superman?

Jedi?

Sounds even more like real life...It's the shitty working conditions, long
hours and average pay that does it.

I have played it, not overly impressed, tbh. I may give it another shot
around after a month or so. I understand it is still suffering teething
problems. I don't actually know anyone IRL that likes the game but I think
it needs some time to find it's feet a bit.

What I most liked about it is how different it is from EQ but if you think
that this difference will mean guilds will not form like FoH then you are
deluding yourself.
