Honestly, no clue how they're figuring it.  I'd be more curious as to why
you would care.  That "DPS" number listed has absolutely zero relevance to
reality.  If you're just looking for a number to compare to get a quick and
dirty "which is better for me" comparison, the ratio and some common sense
will suffice (also, figure the ratio as damage/delay instead of delay/damage
to get a number that more people will be familiar with).

Anyone who has played a melee to high levels will look at the "DPS" figures
for stone etched warblade compared to ornate greatblade and laugh.  A weapon
with a better ratio *and* an actual damage bonus is rated at less "DPS" than
a weapon with worse ratio and minimal damage bonus.  Not bloody likely.
