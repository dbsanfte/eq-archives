Good point. I forgot about that. Only downside to that
area is no newbie guards to run to. But with the new no exp
loss and CR for level 1-10 that place would be awesome!

I also forgot the qeynos sewers. They are not that great
but they are never crowded. Good for learning about
pathing in dungeons also. And for getting that swimming skill
up =)
