Unless the Ensoniq works better on XP than 2k, don't bother with that one.
While there are some exceptions, it seems that sound, EQ, and any variant of
windows NT do not mix all that well.  Sound generally has issues under
windows 2k and xp.

I use win2k with built in soundblaster compatible sound, and it mostly
works, but it's far from perfect.
