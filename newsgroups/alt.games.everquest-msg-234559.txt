The actual sentence in the original post was

"WILL BABY AILEEN HORWATH BE MOLESTED IN THE HOME? You decide!"

Idiot I agree with, where does sick come in?  If Mr. Horwath is a child
pornographer distributor or maker the concern is warrented, although it
doesn't belong in this NG and I think disclosing the man's personal
information should be retaliated against with a lawsuit.
