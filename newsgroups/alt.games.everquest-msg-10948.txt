Ok, now comes the question of pricing.

Each piece takes about 12pp to 15pp per attempt (the pearl for the viscous mana alone
is about 9-11pp, depending on charisma and faction), assuming all materials are
purchased from merchants and farmers.

Including the gauntlets (which give light rather than an agility bonus), a full suit
of Wu's is 58 AC, +29 Agi and weighs 1.2. Currently, the Gauntlets sell for about
40pp on Xev, ie about 10pp/AC (the gauntlet formula requires not only the viscous
mana but also a greater lightstone. I expect most other pieces would be a bit less
per AC.)

My question is, what would you non-tailoring monks be willing to pay for most of
these items?
