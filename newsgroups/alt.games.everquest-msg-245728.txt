EQOA is vastly different from the PC version.  Some have called it EQ-
lite, not without reason.  You don't get as many spells as on PC version 
ie: Druids only get 5 port spells total and those only if they do 
certain quests.  Questing is alot more necessary on EQOA, there are 
abilities or spells you can't get unless you do the quests ie: Warriors 
don't get taunt unless they do quests.
I personally like EQOA alot.  I play it more than I play PC version.  If 
you are thinking of playing, don't fall victim to them selling you the 
original version.  Buy Frontiers right off, you won't regret it.  
You might want to check out the forums at hodstock.com.  Even if you 
don't end up making a character on hodstock server, there is still alot 
of information on that site and it's unofficial so you don't have to 
worry about sony retaliation for anything said there.
If you need more detailed info about playing, feel free to send email to 
me direct.
