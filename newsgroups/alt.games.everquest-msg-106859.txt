there is a txt file in c:\programs\everquest called DataRate.
open in notepad
change the number (default is 5, the highest) down one integer, save,
and retry game.
be aware however that if the number gets too low, it will take longer to
zone.
mine is on 3 and works well.
my boyfriend had a severe problem like yours, so far we have put in 4
and are waiting a bit to see if it improves in frequency.

when this happens to him, he is still in game on my screen and fighting,
or whatever he was doing.....it won't say linkdead til he hits the reset
button.

hope this idea helps you.
