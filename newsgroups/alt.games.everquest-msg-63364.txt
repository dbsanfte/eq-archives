This site also has some good info on research
http://mythiran.allakhazam.com/, not sure if it adresses triv skill for
research though. For locations of various practise research components, go
to www.castersrealm.com and/or the beastiary at www.allakhazam.com

For each spell circle you need to practise or train up to your maximum level
before attempting to research spells, max skill=(lvl-15)*5, and that will
give you a decent shot at success when creating the spells. I assume that
the risk for failure when making new spells with maxed skill increases as
you gain levels. At 34 I experienced my first failures when researching
spells at maxed skill - three in a row to be exact :(

Practise research basically means travel across Norrath to pick up mostly
non-stackable cheap loot plus one or two more expensive type of armour drops
for each series of practise runes, so using points at trainer to max your
skill is actually worth it IMO to avoid the hazzle. Keep some training
points for other skills though, so at some point (early on rather than later
when also practise get expensive), do some practise research to save a
buffer of training points.
