No, first off, I don't think it needs to talk about Sexually Transmitted 
Infections (STIs is the new in-vogue term according to some sources. yay.) 
to teach tolerance of people with a condition that may not be their fault 
and may cause them extreme ostracism.

Second, I really don't know for sure, but 2 seems awfully young for the 
Sesame Street I remember, and 5 seems similarly young for when you stop 
enjoying it.  Perhaps adding Elmo changed the target market substantially, 
but I would have guessed more 4-8ish.  Anyone got a Sesame Street video 
and want to report the recommended ages there for us?  Or is 2-5 already a 
quote from one?
