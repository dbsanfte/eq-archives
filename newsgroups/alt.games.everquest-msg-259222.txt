> Hi all;

/wave

Welcome to the newsgroup!

It's always a bit surprising (but in a good way) to meet someone actually 
*new* to the game. With all the discussion around here about the most uber 
gear and the most elaborate strategies for obtaining it from the deepest 
corners of the game, it's refreshing to hear someone recount their first 
attempts to get starting gear from some of the starting quests.

Here are some useful links:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/
(great site for quest and item information)

http://eq.crgaming.com/menu/spells.asp
(great site for summary spell lists)

http://www.eqatlas.com/
(great site for maps of the zones)


Between these and this newsgroup, you should be able to find out most 
anything you need to know about the game.

Good luck and have fun!
