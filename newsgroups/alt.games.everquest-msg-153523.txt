If they're going to make Complete Heal NOT a Complete Heal, then they
ought to change its name. Otherwise, it's outright lying. Especially
seeing as how they're just doing it as a means to introduce "better"
spells that will just do what Cheal USED to, to sell more copies, as
stated before.

Heaven forbid they actually make improvements based on what's already
there without thumbing their noses at an entire class and line of
spells.
