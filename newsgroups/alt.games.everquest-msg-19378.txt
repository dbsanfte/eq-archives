Part of the problem is that I have played most classes, but my enchanter is
my latest character (only level 3). Once players have played a while they
forget others may not know as much as they do about their characters class.
The info about not attacking the mob with the blue glow is really useful. If
that is how you tell a mob is mes'd then that helps, although maybe the enc
I was grouping with could have pointed out how to tell a mes'd creature,
rather than swearing for two minutes and removing herself from the group
when I said I was doing the best I could, with 4 mobs that all CONned yellow
attacking me (only tank in the party).
