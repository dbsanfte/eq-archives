What do you consider a "decent guild". You can't solo for 52 levels
and then expect guilds to jump at the chance to invite you. You need
to group with people and build a network of in-game "friends". 

If you are a casual player, you will most likely never see the
"Uber-Zones" or content. You just need to ask yourself, is that a bad
thing? So what if you never hit level 60 or never raid in VT or NToV.
As long as you are having fun playing the game (no matter what level
you are), that is all that matters.

So, don't solo, and don't create alts. Go to zones where other players
your level hunt, and join/start pick-up groups.

What you get out of EQ is directly related to what you put into it.
Enjoy the journey. There is no prize for hitting level 60, or getting
the "Uber-Item" for your class.
