You don't agreee with what?

Did you read the post you quoted?

Wait, no, make that did you read the section you quoted?

He said 20 mana per tic

You then said 20 hp per tic.

The two are hardly synonymous.

Generally, one person is taking damage from a mob, which means 20 hp per 
tic adds up to 20 hp per tic.

But generally several people in your group are consuming mana, which 
means 20 mana per tic adds up to 80 mana per tic.

But note that he didn't say "20 mana per tic" he said "AE 20 mana per 
tic".

That means he's talking about the bard hitting a raid sized force, lets 
say 30 people, at least 20 of which are consuming mana.  Now its 400 
mana per tic the bard is worth to you.

Is one monk really going to do so much DPS he's the equivalent of 400 
mana per tic?

Of course the bard isn't going to be singing only this one song if he's 
worth a bucket of vah shir spit, but we'll stick to this one just for 
starters.
