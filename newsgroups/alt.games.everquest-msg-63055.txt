I alternate my styles at the moment.  Some I melee and some I kite.  My
brother is a high level enchanter and his advise a while back was, to work
on ALL the skills.   This included defense and melee.  Made sense that it
would get harder to work those skills at higher levels.  A blue at lower
level is nothing like a blue at higher ones.

Been working Thistle in Lesser Fay lately and, with him being a druid and
all, even as a blue he knocks me down pretty well.  I usually have one bar
near empty the Mana or Health, depending on the style I chose and misses,
fizzles or resists I get.

I would like to get some good wisdom gear, but I am mostly looking for the
quick return quests.  I can't play for long periods at a time, so I always
have to try to make the most of my time on when I can.

I currently have on BERTOX SERVER:  Ridge, 29 Druid.  Toxic, 18 Paladin.
Rydge, 9 Warrior.  Malingerer, 9 Rogue
