Others have answered this, but let me add a "me-too" response: yes, AAXP
goes much faster at 60 than at 51.  Go to Cazic Thule, kill the zone-in mobs
for a few hours, and just watch the AAXP fly.

So that's another reason to wait until 60 to start accumulating AAXP: it
will be much more efficient then.

It's a game-playing decision, of course.  Some people have more fun with the
AAXP than the regular XP grind, so they start accumulating AAXP early.  For
me, I was tired of buying SoW potions or constantly getting left behind in a
dungeon as we moved from place to place, so at 52 I put everything thing
into AAXP until I had Innate Run 3.  That greatly improved my quality of
life.  It was kinda fun outrunning people who used to outrun me, to have
them tell me, "Wait, I don't have SoW" and to be able to reply, "Neither do
I!"
