Hi all,

I am STUCK!! I went to Erudin to get my lvl 19 Bard song, and decided
to take a walk about Odus. When I went to Paineel I enterred the
newbie zone and headed accross to the temple entrance to The
Warrens(?). I stopped immediately due to the two skeleton guards and
Neclo Saah (who conned blue).

At this point I decided to turn about and head back up to Erudin. Only
problem is that I cannot find the stupid entrance out of the newbie
zone, and back to Tox. Is this a oneway zone?

Where is the entrance? (or was Saah guarding the entrance, and hadn't
spawned as of yet? If so, I've got some trouble.

Advice us greatly appreciated.

Later,

Robert
