I think the problem is that your definition of "single group content" does
not match Sony's - or most people's for that matter.

For most people, "single group" means six, sometimes five, rarely four.
I've only done a handful of three-person groups that weren't power-leveling
sessions, and in those instances, soloing would have been better XP for the
most part.  Nothing in EQ is optimized for a three-person group, including
the new expansion.

I'm probably breaking the NDA by saying this, but... LDoN is not something
you can do "sub-optimally".  Your single group better know what it's doing
or you won't be accomplish the specified goals.  This is not a leisurely
dungeon crawl, like you might to in Dragon Necropolis, for example.  You're
on a clock, and if you don't get on the ball, you won't anything done.
Think of it like a sixty-minute PoJ trial, except different.

I know I'm not breaking the NDA by saying this: there are an incredible
number of morons playing the beta.  =)  I can't wait to try the LDoN content
with my guildmates, who are a competent bunch.  I've only had one good beta
group so far.
