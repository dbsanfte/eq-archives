All my guild isn't 60 either, I believe we have a few still level 59.

No, my point was simply that in reply to "if you don't have warriors,
clerics and enchanters, you can't raid".

So I called your bluff.. I named a high level raiding zone that can be done
without a warrior.  Heck, you don't even need an enchanter for ToV.  Bards
can sub in for an enchanter and the mobs still going to die.

Now for an example in a zone your perhaps more acustomed with.. plane of
hate.  If a monk/SK/Paladin can tank ToV mobs, then i'll be damned if they
can't tank plane of hate mobs (which hit for less than ToV)

Its not about the whole game living in nToV, it was an example to show the
invalidity of the claims.

And a fyi, I believe FoH used a naked bard to tank nToV dragons one time.
Warriors.. who needs em? :)

-m  <-- <3s his guild warlords
