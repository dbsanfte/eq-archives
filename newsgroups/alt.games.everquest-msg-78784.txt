First, you can do this quest, I ran a level 1 ogre warrior out to Kael once,
just because I was bored.  I ran out to Thurgadin at level 14 on my druid.
I escorted a level 5 paladin to Thurgadin with my druid at 37(he even killed
a snow bunny for exp =P, although the Ry'Gorr clan scout nearly one hitted
him, heh)

YOU JUST CAN'T KILL ANYTHING OR GET ATTACKED, it's not that exceedingly
difficult, and you can use the soulbinder at the gnome dock so if you do die
doing this it's not that long of a run.  And 35 or higher isn't exactly
correct, my warrior soloed a cougar in iceclad easily at 30, and my druid
nearly lived in velious from 28 to 32 on cougars and tizmak (I stopped
tizmak at dubious, but tried to kill Yaka and failed (he had the gloves!),
tried to run to Thurg to avoid faction hit but some bastard killed him and
I'm KoS to tizmak now)

Also, you should keep the jagged bands for a while, since they have VERY
high AC for rings on average, although once you're higher level or richer, I
advise picking up 2 velium fire wedding rings (6ac 65hp each).

And as far as missing with the bow, its ok, you primarily want to use a bow
for pulling, since that avoids having to go up and smack the monster
directly, thus giving it a free counterattack while you turn and run to pull
it back to your group.
