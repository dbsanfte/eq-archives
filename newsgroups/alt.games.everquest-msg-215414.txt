Are you trolling or do you genuinely have no clue?  HP is the number 1 stat for
clued up Necros - it's almost impossible to wear any Int caster gear and not
get a sufficient manapool.

"As said, int over 200 is a waste. I'd actually say that, for lower levels, int
over 160 isn't going to make much difference unless you are a tradeskiller. But
if you can afford it, go for it. Whatever else you do, get HP. You don't even
need mana that much, except to boost your mana pool at low levels; it's the
rate of regen that counts, not the size of the pool."
