Yeah. When there's 2 of you. Try it with 3 friends: B, C, & D who all 
have different schedules and lives:

So assuming you are "A" now you've got a character for when B is on, 
when C is on, when D is on, when B & C are on together, and when just C 
& D are on together, and when B & D are both on... not to mention a 
character for when B & C AND D are ALL on.

Keeping 1 character in lockstep with 1 other character as part of duo 
(like husband/wife) works fabulously. But if I had to keep a separate 
alt to run in lockstep with each of my lowbie friends I'd go nuts.

I actually tried that back in 99... I had a main, an alt I just played 
when one of my friends was on, another alt I just played when another 
friend was on, and another alt I just playned when the whole group was 
on. Then one of my frends got bored of his alt and wanted to reroll a 
different character... it got old FAST.
