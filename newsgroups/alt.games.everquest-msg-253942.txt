As others have said .. killing absolutly everything is the best way to go ..
but my personal experince is they seem more frequeint the more scorpians you
kill .. maby just coincidance but it worked for me .. killing  the grimlings
seemed to make no dirrence whatsoer to me but that is just my experinces ..
but if you like lots of hard work don't ignore the grimlings totaly ...
there is a LONG HARD quest that involves there blood .. that gives a 50%WR
'bag' ( this is posably more tedious than some epics so only the brave need
apply ... )

But as with most newbi quests .. don't expect the drops to be on the first 4
mobs you kill .. on saying this 'tho .. the vah shar newbi quests did seem
eseyer than any of the others I have compleated .. posably due to the
concentration of the mobs needed .. ( if yout in the pit killing stuff your
in the right place )

DO look the quest up on the web and work out ALL you need from the mobs
first .. there is nothing more fustrarting than going back down the pit
hunting for sonthing you have left to rot a few times when you thought you
didn't need it ..

Persiveriance is the real key to this one .. but the lute is useble for the
rest of your bardic life .. i have shown mine to many a wood elf and made
them greener ..
