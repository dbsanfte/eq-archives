welcome to the school of "Hard EQ Knocks".

question about coin:  forget about it!  making coin is over rated.  :)

Buy a Foremans Tunic with the 100pp.  GSB is overrated and more expensive

here's a suggestion on hunting until 30.

I too was in the same boat.  Wore patchwork armor until 26.  (I know, it was
crazy...but I was more interested in leveling)

15:  Oasis:  get into a Orc highway group.  hopefully you have a good
puller.  Or, solo i North Karana...on Hounds, Patriach Lions, and maybe crag
spiders.  Save the pelts and silks for tailoring...I sold mine...my mistake.

17:  Lake Rathe:  get into a Aviak group.  preferbly 3spawn.  xp here is
good with decent flow to regen mana and heal. Harmony works great for
2player group.  (many will tell you go hit Lake of Ill Omen.  thats fine.
But you can level to 20 in LR with relative safety.)  Group with a Necro.
(the most powerful combo team in game)

22: Here's my trick.  Bind at LOIO at FM zone line.  Port to commons and run
upto High Keep.  This is the best zone for a Druid.  You should make this
your primary zone until mid - high 20s.  This is an "outdoor" zone with a
bank and vendors.  Get into a group fighting Picklaw Guards and maybe
Warriors. Eventually, you can hit Raiders.  but not until 30s.  Learn where
to run if group gets overwhelmed by the mobs.  I'll let you learn this
part...CAMP HERE.

try to get into HK group when you get back in game.  If there are no spaces,
then get on group list and gate to LOIO.  Tell them to send you a tell when
spot opens.  Gate to LOIO.  join a group outside sarnak fort.  (Druids are
loved in this zone for SOW and DS).  when spot opens in HK, then port to
Commons and run upto HK.  I found LOIO full of idiots with a greed to loot.
It brings out the worst in gamers.  If you dont turn into a loot hog in this
zone, then you're doing something worng.  HK tends to have "old school"
gamers.  they know how to share and cycle the loot drops.

26:  Frontier Mountains.  stay in this zone until you get TWO forest loops.
When you get the 2nd loop, you'll have about 1Kpp in the bank from all the
Mountain Giant drops.  Trust me.
Or,  Lesser Fay.  Get into wolf form.  Find Faerie Guards.  harmony, snare,
dd, root, dot until dead.  nice coin, fine steel weapons.

Buy Gator Leggings 600-700pp


34:  Ogre Shaman in East Karana.  *this was exciting for me*  The Ogre
Shamans drop cracked bone braclet(+5 Wis).  The camp is hard to break.  I
did it solo.  They have HUGE aggro range.  have snare ready and all buffs
up.  Mem your Heal, DD, root, and dot spells.  target Chief Dooga's pet,
approach the camp directly into one of the Ogre Gaurds.  There are four of
them, you need to come onto one of them at 90 degrees.  this is were it gets
fun.  the guard will harm touch you. Ogre Shamans and Chief will come after
you.  you run (in Wolf Form) like hell SOUTH. keep running until pet catches
up to you.  turn and snare it.  He's a pain in the butt and drops nothing.
Shamans and Chief would have stopped a few times to cast on you.  Keep
RUNNING!  when you get to the river, turn around and snare the Chief.  run
West.  Let the Shamans chase you, they all have SOW,  so they will keep up
with you for a good while.  Snare each of them when you can.  target one
Shaman and DD until they dead.  they have very little HPs.  hunt them until
once you get TWO bracelets.

35+  go to ButcherBlock.  Hunt Dwarfs.  there is a guide on eqdruids.  I'm
not gonna repeat it here. Or join HG groups in Rathe Mountains.
Lightning Strike spell!!!   Iceclad. Quad Kite Cougars.  you get LS at 34,
but doesn't really become effective on quad kiting until 35....

40+  Solo Giants in Rathe.

42:  Eastern Wastes:  Quad Kite Walrus or Ulthorks.  Ulthorks drop tusks
that can be taken to Chief in SC for random gem.  I got two blue diamonds
and a few ruby crowns.  Sells for a couple hundred plat to vendor.  (get
Charisma buff from chanter before selling gems to vendor.  Prices vary
greatly.

Might as well do PAW quest.

Hunt in DL. Do Blugtigin cycle in FM...make a lot of coin...but boring as
hell.

Dude, dont worry about making coin in general.  It all comes with time.


by this time you've probably collected 7 - 10kpp

you'll then be answerering the Newbie how to level their druid.
