When the Bazaar first went live, the developers had remembered
to make it impossible to be encumbered no matter how much coin
or gear you were carrying -- but forgot to remove the way that
being vastly over your weight limit affects falling damage.

As a result, lots of people were dying just running down the
stairs from the upper floor of the vendor building, or
hopping down into the PvP arena.

I think that jumping with the spacebar could be
fatal too.
