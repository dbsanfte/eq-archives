No... practicing on green cons will NOT give you skill xp, unless its
a false con and you get xp from kill.
Though not exactly sure about that one... if its TRUE green and you
get no xp.. you can kill thousands of those and it won't raise your
skills.

ONLY mobs you can get XP from will raise your combat skills and
abilities.  The false con greens may be the exception.
