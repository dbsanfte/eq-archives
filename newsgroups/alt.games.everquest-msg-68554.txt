First off: the world will always be divided into several camps concerning
fps.

It's true that Q3 is more innovative concerning 3d engine, but the game
itself is not even remotely as good as UT IMO. Q3's worlds are to dark and
monotonous of color. The weapons are not innovative or varied, except in
power, where only the railgun and rocketlauncer are the only ones used (yes
I can kill with a shotgun, but in the same time I can kill 5 to 6 players
with a rail).

The maps aren't especially great (seen any good outside map for Q3?), no
alternate fire on weapons and no new game-modes make Q3 a whole lot less
innovative in gameplay.
The snipermode on every weapon (especially the rail) makes open fields
boring and overpowers some weapons (again the rail).

The engine is great, the game is not.

And yes, I played both games for weeks/months. I played UT more and more
because it's more varied and entertaining, up to the point that I removed Q3
from my HD. It's been on it again for a few LAN-games from time to time, but
after a few matches everyone switches to UT anyway.
