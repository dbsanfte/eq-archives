    Yummy! You can keep the black ones, though. Don't like the taste of
licorice.

    I'm thinking before the end of March. They can devote all their efforts
to it, and as far as I know it's not a blowable spawn. That means trying
every day, and refining tactics every day, until you get it right. If it is
blowable, well, you won't need my address for those jelly beans.

    I'm willing to bet there's a strategic "trick" to things, as right now
it looks like you have to straight-up kill 12 bosses at once. Corinav looked
impossible, too - kill 150 blue-to-65 mobs, 3 minibosses, and Corinav in
under 17 minutes? But they found the trick, worked on the pulling to learn
the pathing, and got it done.
