I remember being a new player on a middle aged server in September
2000. I never zoned out of GFay till I was level 8. I bought my
patchwork armor for batwings when I was level 4/5, and I was upset
when I at level 12 combined my precious tarnished scimitar with my
fishing pole in my sewing kit and had to go back to using a rusty
scimitar. I remember scrimping and saving to buy a runed totem staff
after being killed by a ghoul at level 14, only to have someone I
grouped with give me one when I mentioned what I was saving up for. I
felt like a badass when I could afford to buy splitpaw hide gloves and
a savant's cap :)
