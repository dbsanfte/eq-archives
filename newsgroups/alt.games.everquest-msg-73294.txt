    All standard attempts to make them into jewelry have failed. So far,
nobody has found out what form the "expanded jewelcraft" in Luclin has
taken - no new recipes as yet. Since the players were told that JC in SoL
would be different from standard JC, I wouldn't be surprised if the combines
were supposed to be with something other than an enchanted bar. Aren't there
a ton of other previously-useless items on the metal bar vendors? And it
really piques me that those SoL gems have names that suggest the metals used
to make Plane of Hate/Fear armours....
