It really isn't that simple. I can think of plenty of spots where
letting a puller run off at 50% hitpoints is cool but I can name you
just as many where I want the puller at full when he heads out. Hell,
sometimes even in the same dungeon, depending on the camp. Pre-Pop, HS
was a prime example of a dungeon where I'd always want the puller (and
pretty much the rest of the group) at full HP. Having your puller eat
3 or 4 HTs wasn't all that uncommon there and wasting mana keeping
someone at full HP was worth it IMO. 


In general, I'd agree with you though. Especially if you have group
regen or any class with decent group heals, it's usually a waste not
to make use of them.
