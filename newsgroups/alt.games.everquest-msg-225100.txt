Joined my 48 shaman friend today for some hill giant slaughter; she 
wasn't sure how long she could play, and this was something we could 
start quickly and leave without regrets.  Plus there was nobody in the zone!

I had a good deal of trouble getting a MS pet up who would cast DS on 
himself, I chain cast a few, then gave up and started using them to kill 
stuff and reclaiming after a few kills, because reclaiming on a full 
mana bar strikes me as about as sane as canni on a full HP bar would.

After about 15 minutes I finally got a DSing pet up, which we proceded 
to fully shaman buff, then we got serious... probably half again the 
kill rate because the buffs DO help, plus I wasn't continuously fooling 
around killing pet and making new one.

Let me tell you folks, a 50 mage pet with a full set of shaman buffs can 
lay waste to HG like nothing I've seen, including druids, wizards, and 
bards; the latter can indeed take down 4 while I'm killing one... but 
finding 4 at a time means a lot of wasted time running around.  I could 
kill one, two, even three at a time by my self, and with the shaman's 
help could take down 4 (this was too much for just me to handle the 
healing).  But I could also kill PH's between kills at a whim, and even 
run off looking for more while the pet killed single hills unsupervised, 
I'd deliberately pull another and train the poor little guy with it.

The shaman could also handle any single pull and most double pulls, I'd 
keep her in DS and if my pet ran out of work would add him in to her 
kills just as she'd send her dog along at anything big I was on, or keep 
up the good fight by using it to kill PH's just as I was.  At times we 
were killing 5 HG at the same time.

The biggest thing slowing down the kill rate was looting; running up to 
bodies and pulling off the FS, then taking the remaining junk and 
destroying one by one so as to get rid of the body.  Even this wasn't 
too bad, as I could have pet killing a HG or any lesser mob while I did 
it... but it meant I wasn't actively looking for the next target.

Boasting?  Yes, so it would seem, and it -was- nice to feel the raw 
screaming power of this duo at work... but here's the thing.

I destroyed copper and gold, and words/pages/runes, and toes.  I filled 
up 4 10 slot summoned bags with FS weapons, plus we both had split on 
and looted about even numbers of mobs (using the "whoever has a moment 
spare to clean up the mess" plan).  She came out with 750pp, I came out 
with 827pp, so I either looted more often than her or she was destroying 
gold as well.

Thats 1500 pp in about 2 hours... far short of what I hear people 
claiming.  But I don't recall ever seeing anyone with a kill rate close 
to what we were pulling down, until the last half hour we were 
practically alone in the zone and owned the entire hilltop, where we 
held a scorched earth policy: Nothing was allowed to live, pop and die.

Is there something we were supposed to be keeping thats valuable enough 
to occupy the bag space?  Did we ditch too much small change (it was 
getting real heavy)?  Or was our kill rate not really as high as it seems?
