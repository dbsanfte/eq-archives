PCI -> Peripheral Component Interconnect.  Came out around 1993.  The main 
thing it did that I was happy for was taking the IRQ dispersion out of the 
hands of the peripherals and into the MOBO.  Most every peripheral card 
comes in a PCI version, now.

AGP -> Accelerated Graphics Port.  Looks like a PCI slot, but set back 
further, and like he mentioned above, everyone I have seen is brown.  
Standards are a GoodThing(tm).  As far as I know, being out of the serious 
hardware scene for a couple years, they are only for Video Cards, and only 
for AGP ones, at that.  There's AGP 2x and 4x that I know of, I'm sure 6x 
or 8x will be out before long if it isn't already.

Your motherboard probably has some legacy ISA slots, and if it has just an 
8-bit slot, it will look like an AGP slot ( usually brown ), but you can 
tell it apart in that it will line up with the PCI slots, whereas an AGP 
slot will be further back from the back of the computer.
