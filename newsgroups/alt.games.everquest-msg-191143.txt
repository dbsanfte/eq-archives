When I was in my 40's, my memblur worked fine.  Now that I'm in the mid-
50s, the mobs just ignore it for the most part.  I have the same problems 
with Reoccuring Amnesia, too.  Cleric Atone always works better in the 
groups I am in if we need to wipe the hate list for some reason.

If you are under level 50, atone can be very helpful to your group if you 
have a lot of adds at one time.  You can get adds to leave the battle if it 
is a long one by atoning a mezzed mob that isn't too proximate to the camp.  
I always took my groups out into an open area in DL ( SE of KC ) where we 
never had problems with finding things to kill.  The mobs would usually add 
to our battles by themselves.  Once in a while, we would get more than we 
wanted and I would have thr group reposition away from some of the adds.  
Then the cleric would atone the mezzed ones.  When mez broke, they would 
walk away.  Atone is good for making a rooted / mezzed mob forget that you 
cast 2 CHs, too, but root can be just as effective for keeping the mob off 
of you.  Root is great for peeling and parking adds and it's great at 
forcing the mobs on the MT, which can get harder later on if you are using 
a Warrior as a MT.  Of course, your melees all need to understand how root 
works.

Fear is great in non-old world zones.  Fear and forget =)

We went to Nadox the other day after our guild ganked Faydedar and had a 
blast.  I got my Garish Sash after killing that bastard about 10 times ( 9 
gloves, 1 sash, no capes(?) ).  Some nice caster pauldrons dropped ( had 
"hate" in the name ), and our clerics and druids got their items for their 
spell quests.  It was a lot of fun going into a zone with no maps and 
pushing in as far as we could go.  I kept waiting for someone to fall into 
some deadly trap.  We got to the really cool room with the neat altar ( 
where the mobs started to go yellow to me at 55 ) and got caught in fast 
repops.  Ended up backing out and had our only death of the day.  Nice zone 
for Exp and caster drops.  Had a couple pathing incidents, but nothing 
disastrous.  Those suckers hit hard.
