Luclin Ports a Reality soon 8/10/02
 
From Rich Waters lead developer:
Luclin ports 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all,

Thought you'd be interested to know that we're adding in Luclin ports
and putting them on Test server this weekend. These spells will be
available to both druids and wizards as convenient vendor sold
scrolls. 

We've added a Nexus port for druids, and ports to Dawnshroud, Twilight
Sea, and Grimling Forest for wizards and druids. This should help cut
the travel time to the remote areas of Luclin, and it's something that
a lot of players have been asking for.

Take care,

- Rich

Personally, I have mixed feelings about this.  I kinda liked that fact
that travel in Luclin required a little effort.  On the other hand, as
a druid, it'll be kind of nice to not have to expend that effort.  :-)
