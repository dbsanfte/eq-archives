I didn't say they were all smart calls (in my opinion) just that they were
called that way. : p

I'm not sure what he did that was special enough they thought ranged had to
be used.   Some kind of lifetap, I think.

Fennin was more than a bit silly to do as ranged, rather than having melee
do jousting runs to avoid the AE while still getting the fight to under an
hour long ; p

Still can't believe /backflag raid called ranged only on Agnarr of all
things.  Just as I was in the middle of laughing over how little damage his
AE did.   Very frustrating to be cut down to about 2% of your normal damage,
for no good reason.
