When did the problem start?
Have you rebooted (including powering off) since the problem started?
What/when was the last piece of software you added?
What/when was the last piece of hardware you added?

Go to www.download.com and find a nice large file to download...one that'll
take you 15 minutes (doesn't matter what it is, you'll be deleting it).
Watch the download...is the speed steady?
