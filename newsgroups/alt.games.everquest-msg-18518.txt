Cool. A tribute to different playing styles. No doubt a reason why this
subject comes up again and again.

The way *I* play, soloing wins with Evo easily since the most mana
intensive spell I use is Lightning strike when quadding - in remote out
of the way places :). If I'm not quadding, I'm dotting with swarms
and/or immolate which is Conjuration/Evocation. The Snare/Root is less
than 10% of this process.

My character is a 36 level druid, with 183 WIS. I've found rooting FG's
in Velious works. Big money Giants, though, like Hill giants in the
Karanas pretty much laugh at your futile attempts at rooting them. They
either resist outright or break root in 6 seconds or so. A little trick
I've used is the Sunbeam spell. Generally considered crap, it is rarely
resisted and gives you 18 - 30 seconds free med time when fighting HG's,
not to mention your DOT's start doing full damage. Not bad for 40 mana.
My point here is that even soloing Giant's, Conjuring (Swarm DOT) and
Divination is used more than Alteration - one or two ensnares max.
Again, the way *I* play :).

In groups, Heal definitely is nice to chain cast when things start going
bad. It is also a good taunt, which helps if you want to pull mobs off
overwhelmed tanks and root park them (sans Chanter). All plusses for
Alteration. If you are designated Evac guy - you better not fall below
evac mana no matter what your specialization is. I can live with Evo in
this situation and be a little less efficient at rooting - pulling mobs
off tanks with DD spells has the benefit of dinging them pretty good
sometimes.

Oh yes, one last thing. I can almost always get one last root or snare
off - or SOW for that matter - since these require far less mana than
DD. So if I have insufficient mana for DD, I will still have enough for
snare.

Oh yes, one more last thing :). Just choosing to "Ultra" specialize in a
school doesn't mean you don't get specialization bonuses. Just not as
often, you still get up to 50 skill in other schools.
