Hi all,

Just wondering if anyone has experience trying to play EQ from China.
I'll be there over the summer in Shanghai.  I'll be staying in places
with Broadband internet (or so I've been promised), but I was
wondering if anyone had experience with how bad lag would be and if
there are any issues with government induced firewalling.

Also, my current laptop is a PIII mobile 933MHz with 632MB of ram,
which is unfortunately shared with the video processor.  If I strip
down all textures and all the other tricks, do you think it could do a
reasonable job rendering EQ? 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks in advance!
