A better idea is to use /pet sit down, as then it will not aggro as it would
with a /pet guard here  Often the allowable paths for npc's in dungeons do
not follow where *you* can walk, so the pet will try to go around in the
shortest prgrammed path, often running into mobs, which then come after you.
Always keep an eye on your pet, and try not to move to fast around windy
areas.  One other thing, do not get SoW'ed, or if you do, make sure your pet
is SoW;ed too, so it can keep up with you (still not a good idea because
then your pet can run into trouble twice as fast).
Your pet is your greatest asset in a fight, but in many dungeons it is your
greatest threat without a bit of sense.
Also, if you are going to be 'camping' a certain area (such as the snake
ledge in bb) then don't cast your pet until you get there if you feel
confident enough to get there safely, as the pet will just make it harder.

Not that I am an expert, but 20 levels as a mage has taught me a few things.

Also note that if you get no response (ie no Following you master on a /pet
follow me) then your pet is out of range and will not respond to anything,
keep tapping the follow me, and backtrack your steps until you get a
response.  This was probably why /pet get lost did not work.
