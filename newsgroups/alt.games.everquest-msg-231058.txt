Awesome! Right now I'm on as early as 9 am EST and can go as far as
2:30pm before going to work. Then after work at midnight EST to whenever I
get
tired, usually around 2am.

  Is Kinslayer your character's name? I checked yesterday but you weren't
online when the rest of TuT was forming up in Tranquility.

  Thanks for the info. Now I know who's hopelessly out of reach for me; I
work for
a living, and value my sleep, so I won't be joining any hard-charging
guilds. But one
that can give me just a little extra >oomph< to my leveling efforts, that
I'd consider.
