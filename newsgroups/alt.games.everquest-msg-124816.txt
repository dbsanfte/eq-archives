   Man, until I read this thread, I didn't even know that the verdict had been
overturned at all.  And I had been sorta watching the case too, just thought the
whole thing was interesting.  I can't say that I approve of a judge overturning a
jury's verdict, any verdict.  *sigh*
   So, whatever became of the Menedez boys?
