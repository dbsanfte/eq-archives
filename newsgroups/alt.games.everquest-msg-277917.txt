Quite a few in our guild have left EQ for EQ2 or for other reasons. What
they generally do is give away anything and everything they can, keep
the no drop on the character and just quit paying for the account. That
way, if they ever do get to the point where they feel they can/want to
come back, their characters are still there, although a little less
clothed than they once were.

Why delete it? No reason to really.

Yes, it is asking too much. SOE does not support and even specifically
states that you can't do it. And every time you clicked 'accept' on the
EULA, you agreed to it.
