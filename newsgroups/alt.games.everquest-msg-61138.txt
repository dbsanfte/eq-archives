I touched upon this in another thread.  Didn't happen to me, but someone 
else warned me of it in game.  I had the "ding, but my EXP bar shows 4 
blues" graphics bug, and he said he had that bug for a couple of levels, 
except that when he dinged, now, he would also get dropped from the game.

The 2 bugs probably aren't related, but at least you know you aren't the 
only one, now =)
