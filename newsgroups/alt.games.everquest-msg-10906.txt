Thanks...that was actually what I tried to do (except I didn't try to
melee them at half health...I'd get my ass kicked!), I was just doing
it on the wrong monsters.  I first tried doing it to a yellow cyclops,
and that didn't work at all.  For some reason I thought this was the
method to kill giants and such instead of kiting.  But then I did it
in SK to the gnolls (most are blue to me now) and had great success.
Most gnolls would take 2 bubbles to kill as opposed to the 4 I usually
use DD kiting, though sometimes a gnoll would wander in and screw the
whole thing up. :P

It's not quite as exciting as kiting or fear-kiting, but I'll take the
fast and steady exp :)
