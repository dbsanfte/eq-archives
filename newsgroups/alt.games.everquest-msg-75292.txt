  Another option is to find a group and ask them if you can attack
their mobs without joining the group.  Tell them you're practicing
your weapon skills and they'll probably let you, since there's no
chance you're going to outdamage them and KS.  Some might not feel
comfortable with it for fear that you'll break mezz or whatever, but I
haven't found any groups yet that have said no.  The downside is that
you don't get any experience or loot this way.  Sometimes they'll take
pity on you and invite you anyhow. ;)

  And while you're practicing, you might as well try to do it against
a mob that will give you good faction hits.  I practiced by 2HS and
piercing ability on orcs in Highpass with my shadow knight (started
off KOS) and not only did I get some nice skillups, they only glower
at me now instead of going for my throat.
