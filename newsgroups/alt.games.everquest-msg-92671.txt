Ive always trained my casters using low mana spells. It works fine. Its
gonna take a long long time to train evo past 150 with that slow recovery
undead spell tho. If it were me, id try and find a convenient way to xp
while using one of your evo spells. perhaps spectres in oasis, or
skellies/apes (undead) in burning wood.
