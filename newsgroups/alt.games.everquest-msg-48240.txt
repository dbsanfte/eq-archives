It's adequate and good enough for every zone though you may have to kill
clipping some in the Kunark/Velious woody zones.  Then again, I occasionally
have to with my 64MB card.

The game requires a 3D video card, so that part's not a problem.  The most
popular is probably the GeForce2 MX.  To find out the type you have, the
most likely to work is to click Start >> Settings >> Control Panel >>
Display.  Then click on the Settings tab and it should mention your Display
Adapter somewhere on that page.  If it doesn't, look for an Advanced button,
or another likely button.   As long as you don't change anything you can't
really mess anything up.
