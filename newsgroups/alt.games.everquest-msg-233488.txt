I'd say pick up your old character, that's what I did.  Was like
saying "hello" to a friend I hadn't see in a year 8)

Okay so he had some very poor kit but that changes (relatively) fast. 
He was a level 18 monk when I stopped EQ (yes I know people will tell
me that nowdays they get to level 18 before breakfast !) and had taken
the advice of people at the time to concentrate on hand to hand so was
bare-knuckling his way through Befallen !

A few days after restarting he picked up a pair of polished steel
Ulak's for about 2pp each from the bazaar and has never looked back.
