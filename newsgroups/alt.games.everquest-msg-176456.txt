I know what you are asking, but I'm not sure if there is any set formula for
it.  I have read that there is always at least a 5% chance of failure no
matter how high your skill level, so there may also be an inverse 5% chance
of success no matter how low (complete conjecture). If this is true, then
your ability to succeed with each skillup would vary depending on the
trivial level of the item.  For example if the base is 5% and max 95% then
there is a total of 90% to increase.  A trivial of 100 would mean that your
chance to succeed would increase .9% with each skill-up.  If the trivial of
the item was 200 then the increase with each skill-up would only be .45%.
It's also possible that the chance of success/failure varies with each
object just as the chance of skill-up does. Also keep in mind that reaching
trivial does not mean that you have reached the point that you only have a
5% chance of failure (it's more like 20%) so the above formula is only an
example of how the process might work.

You might try posting this question on EQTraders and see if anyone there has
a better answer.
