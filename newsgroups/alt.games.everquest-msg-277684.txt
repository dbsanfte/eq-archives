I thought my last article was a good one and I was hoping to let it sit
and gather some good thoughts. It had some of the best posts I've read
in some time. Tonight, however, John Smedley made an announcement that
forced me to push that article down a notch and cover a new topic.

Tonight SOE announced that it will facilitate the selling of money,
items, and characters on specially flagged Everquest 2 servers. This is
perhaps the largest announcement of a feature or trend since I've
started writing for Mobhunter.

The letter does not speak at all about doing something similar in
Everquest and it is clear from the few folks I spoke to that they are
only planning on considering this for EQ2 for the moment. One wonders
where it may lead if successful.

There are a thousand facets to this topic. I can't begin to cover them
all and hope to get this article out while the news is still hot so I
will say this:

I think it's a mistake.

This is basically a trade between time and money. I play Everquest 2
and progress because I want to see new places. Now I, an employed yuppy
with too much time on my hands, have justification to simply trade in a
few bucks for the time it would take me to earn my progression. It
completely changes the investment in EQ2. It also begins to show a
disturbing trend towards quick fixes and direct response to player
requests rather than considering the whole problem and where it can go.

It is important to understand that SOE is not creating these
characters, money, or items but instead offering a safe transaction
system so that players can sell among themselves. I had a much stronger
reaction until this point became clear. It isn't like SOE is selling a
level 30 any time they want, but I can buy a level 30 if someone is
willing to sell it. SOE will not be establishing the price. Still, this
adds a level of authority and validation to a practice that so far had
been considered sleazy.

Everyone knows how much I support SOE as they move forward in
Everquest. Lately, with the shift towards solo play and now this shift
towards item, character, and money purchasing, I worry for the result
to the social bonding of players in this game.

I don't play EQ for items or money or levels. I play this game to meet
other players and go on adventures. I understand clearly the investment
of spending time to earn levels to see new places and hunt in new
lands. Now that line becomes gray. Should I spend my time leveling to
30 or should I just buy a level 30 and go read a giant George R.R.
Martin tome instead?

There's a thousand facets to this subject and I have a feeling we're
going to see a lot of them on the forums over the next week. Before you
place judgment, make sure to read the letter a few times and sit and
think about the issue. May Tunare watch over us.
