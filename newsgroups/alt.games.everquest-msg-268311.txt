A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the

That's classic fallacious reasoning. Other times, the people who
claimed that didn't understand the situation between the games. Games
like Shadowbane, Horizons, SWG, AC2, L2, CoH, FFXI, even DAoC were
never much of threats to EQ and the people claiming they would kill EQ
were just deluded fools. For the most part, none of those times
included a *better* option. 

This time it's different. EQ2 and WoW may not be better in every way
for everyone, but they are better in *enough* ways for *enough*
people. EQ outfought every mmorpg before now and kept its position.
This time, it's going to take a hit, and that hit will be *big*. It's
already happened, actually - the post I found the most interesting was
one about Stromm mentioning that there was no longer an intact guild
on the entire server capable of reliably getting the members on to
clear Time, let alone later stuff.

It's nothing to be sad about. EQ more than proved itself over the five
and a half years it reigned supreme. Expecting more is unrealistic.
Time to sink down into the horizon.

EQ won't die, though. Just shrink down to subsistence levels. What it
will mean for uberguilders is up in the air at the moment.
