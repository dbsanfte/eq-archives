The game sends more frequent updates for PC's on the same "level"
as you than it does for ones that are above/below you, probably
under the assumption that those folks are likely on a different
"floor" of a multi-level dungeon than you are and irrelevant
anyway.

A common ploy on a PvP server is to run up a hill, which puts
you above someone who is chasing you.  Position updates then
slow down for the person chasing you, and you can turn and
run in another direction (or even back down hill), while all
he will see for a while is you doing what his EQ client program
"predicts" you will do (since it has had no recent position updates),
which is "continue to run in the direction he was moving at the 
last update".

End result:  For several seconds he sees you running in a straight 
line farther up the hill, and he can't see you actually changing 
direction or doubling back to attack him (or escape by running in
another direction).

The same game code can even cause people to vanish entirely,
even if they're quite near you.  While waiting for Vox raids
to start in Everfrost, for example, I sometimes amused myself
by going about "20 feet" up a ramp and then watching the 40+
members of the raid on the "floor" completely vanish after
a few seconds, until I moved back down the ramp and "poof" they
reappeared.
