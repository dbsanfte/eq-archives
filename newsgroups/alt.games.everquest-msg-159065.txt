I did a pickup group yesterday, my first pickup group this year id guess...

I grouped with a 61 druid.  He was the most clueless, stupid player I've
ever met.  Id be surprised if he even grouped before.

He was the first player to be kicked out of a group im in since I was level
25 on my magician (first character)

Really wonder why people are so weary of grouping with druids?
