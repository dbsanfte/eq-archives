Anyway, what the previous whiner... err... poster was complaining about
isn't the issue. If somebody thinks wizards are "broken" because they
are trying to stack up damage over time against a monk or a rogue, they
need to go play a melee class, becasue they don't understand the
wizard's role in groups or raids. Wizards are not about damage over
time. Nor are they about total damage per mob. Wizards are about one
thing and one thing only in terms of damage:

When You Absolutely Positively Have To Have the Mob Dead, And It Has to
Be Dead RIGHT FUCKING NOW OR WE'RE ALL SCREWED.

That's what you need wizards for. ;-)
