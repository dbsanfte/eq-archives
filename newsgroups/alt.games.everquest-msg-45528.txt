    Except for those with /ooc turned off. Correct.

    OK, here's the first issue. At endgame (ToV) raids, there ARE no mezzed
mobs, there are no changes in target, and adds are handled by warriors
tanking the add (yes, in the endgame WARRIORS are the crowd control
specialists). What the main channel is used for is to call out the primary
target, to inform warriors if there are adds they must control, to call out
debuffs as they land, to name which warrior is the focus, and to call out
heals.

    Agreed....

    Re-read what was written to you.

>> heal range plus a bit.

    Healers on an endgame mob will NOT cluster in one place. If one of them
gets aggro and is rushed by the mob (which will be as far as possible from
the healers while the tanks are still in healing range), then because of the
important role proximity plays in Velious aggro ALL the healers will be
wiped out. More typical, where geometry allows, is for the healers to form a
semi-circle at maximum heal radius around the focus warrior. That way, if
one gets rushed the others are hopefully NOT close enough that they all get
aggro and die. So to use /say, it would need to reach (as written above) to
twice max healing range. It doesn't. So /shout or /ooc is used instead.

    There are sub-issues, like not all healing types being with the other
healers (non-clerics may have debuff/nuke roles to play, and will be within
melee range, but are also expected to contribute heals), but that's the big
one.

>> the people
>> that might complain are the non-raiding folks that thought /ooc was there
>> for them to chat about the latest episode of Felicity while they med.

    Something tells me that if anyone tried to talk about Felicity in an
open channel, that all the resulting flames and mocking would clog the
channel pretty quickly. 8)
