Two years and two accounts, I'm finally bored stiff.  Several characters in
their '50s, I've tried starting new characters but I'm just tired of making
levels and worse spending weeks making levels in the mid '50s characters.
Tired of selling loot, tired of the routine.  Seems like every character is
either log on,check your food/water supplies, find a group and kill stuff
for a few hours possibly make 2 or 3 blue bubbles assuming you don't die.
Next day same thing different character.  Or solo which is really boring.
Or play a character at lower levels but it's the same just that you make
experience faster.  I've mastered 3 trades, maxed out every skill on every
character for their level and class.  It seems to get interesting if I get
something nice from a mob but within a week every level 6 has one. lol

any suggestions?

.What do you do in EverQuest that's interesting?
