Or do both of those at the same time.  Hit Crystal Caverns at off hours
(less competition for spawns) and kill the Geonids for the gems they drop
(mostly the focus gems and collectors) that sell really well to vendors and
then while waiting for spawns, kill the crystalline spiders in the tunnel
just nextdoor for the silk they drop that sells well in the bazaar.  Keep
going back and forth and you'll make some good cash fairly quickly.  Also,
rumor has it, killing the spiders causes the named geos to spawn more often.
