[ .. exploit talk .. ]

Now I'm curious. Is playing EQ an exploit in itself? Am I allowed to run to a
shop when my char is hungry or do I have to swim to it backwards to not
exploit something? Are the newbie areas designed for recreational hunting
of lvl 60ies and newbies like me have to hunt on Veeshans peak to be safe
of being banned? Are melee classes only allowed to spellcast, while classes
like the Enchanter have to sit medding in the frontlines to eat up damage
to let the warriors figure out how to actually pronounce the first word
of a spell? Is platinum, gold and silver just a bank currency and you are
only allowed to carry around copper, also when you try to buy a full suit
of magical plate? Is any success with the Sense Heading button to be
reported as a bug and I should guess the right direction by the shading
of the colour in the 'failed' message? Am I responsible for the anorexic
population of Kurns Tower and therefore banned right from start? Is
using the boat to firiona vie (or other boats) not allowed, as they
are only intended to be a pointer on where to swim to kurnak?

Questions, questions, questions....
