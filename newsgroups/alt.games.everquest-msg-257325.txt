I have a problem with the auto-map feature. For most zones
that I frequent, when I hit my auto-map, it comes right up.

For some zones, like SharVahl, PoK, or  W. Karana, hitting
my automap key doesn't do anything. I don't even get
any error message. It simply doesn't come up.

However, if I log on using my friend's account (on my PC),
I can bring up the map for just about every zone I've
gone to, without changing a thing.

I've been told to check my MAPS folder in my EQ dir. 
There is a SHARVAHL.TXT, SHARVAHL_1.TXT, SHARVAHL_2.TXT,
and SHARVAHL_3.TXT. The last 3 are 0 bytes, while
SHARVAHL.TXT is 583kb.


What's going on?
