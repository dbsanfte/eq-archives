I made tons of plat at the early levels with... POTTERY!

I know it sounds too good to believe but let me tell you how I did it.  I
mastered pottery for around 30pp by following the guide on www.eqtraders.com

It took about 3 hours or so to get my skill up to 120 by making bowls and
jars. Remember! dont finish them by firing, just destroy the unfired pieces.
This saves 100's of plat on firing sheets since skill gains come from the
pottery part, not the firing part.  Next, I took my skill up to 150 or so
making stacks of poison vials and lined poison vials which, as a Rogue, you
will need.  Now, your ready to make money.  Just start buying Sand of RO
whenever and wherever you can from players. I pay from 10pp to 20pp each on
my server.  Combine the Sand of RO with about 5 gold worth of clay, water,
patterns and firing sheets to make Small wisdom deities (plus 2 wis in the
handheld and RANGED slot, clerics and druids).

Now, start selling.  I made a hot key to sell them and also to buy the Sand
of Ro and whenever I entered a new zone, I just click on those AUC hotkeys.
Before you know it, you will be getting tell's.  On my server, the deities
sell for 100pp-150pp fairly consistantly. This is FIVE times the plat you
have into it even including the occasional fail or two I get per ten
attempts at making them.  Newer players sometimes would balk at the 120pp
that I want for just a 2 wis item. I explain that this is a "filler" item
for the under-used range slot and that the next higher wis itemsl cost a LOT
more (3k for a medicine totem on my server) and then I tell them to fill
their other wis items first.  I sometimes get a tell from them in a few
weeks saying they are ready to buy one now :-).  My best luck selling is
when passing through zones with druid rings. Good luck.

Using the above methods, I made around 8000-9000pp between levels 20-25.
This allowed me to buy ALL my class armour and some VERY nice piercers for
my level. I don't push the deities as hard anymore, mostly make them and
give them to guildies or friends alts.

One last thing, having a pottery trivial about 120 lets you make the
Thurgadin gate potion in velious. "A GREAT THING"  It is so nice to be able
to gate to velious whenever I want from anywhere in Norrath!

Good luck!
