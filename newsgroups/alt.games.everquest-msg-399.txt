I think I've improved my skill in typing from this thread. ;)

Ok, I want an example of how a person can come to your aid without you
directly asking for it. Asistance in helping kill a monster in most eyes is
seen as attempted kill-stealing. So, explain how an unasked person can come
to a person's aid.

Understood. As far as the name goes, someone lokking to take the game as an
rpg is likely not to put "Lovedemtits" as their name. In90% of the
instances, this holds true. Notice that there is room for exception, albeit
small.

Ok, let me break this down a bit better. There's two forms to this game.. In
Character stuff, and Out of Character stuff. With ALL rpgs, there has to be
some stuff that doesnt make sense, which has to be filed as OOC, since it
doesnt fit into the game, but is useful. Such are the /gu and the banks
transferring money, and direct tells etc etc. Here's another to add to the
list of things that don't make sense in game, but are required/convenient...
The lifts in Kelethin. How do they operate? There's no chains or ropes
moving those platforms. The point I am making about /shout is that it is 99%
Quaker spam, and only 1% relevant, such as shouting about trains and the
such. If people would use the /ooc channel properly, this problem would not
exist. Yet, you can't expect the quakers to even know what /ooc refers to
when they come into this game.

You apparently missed the last message. "Handle" doesn't mean taking them
out.. it means how to react in th name of safety. If you sawa mod of angry
rioters a few blocks down, I'm sure you wouldn't be able to take them on,
but would have sense to run and get somewhere safe. Same concept applies
here. You normally can see a train from a distance, enough time to react in
a proper manner.

Since end of phase 2 beta through nearly a year after final release

No, not really actually. Guilds have websites with charters. The charters
almost never match up with the guild messageboards. What they say and do are
2 different things.
