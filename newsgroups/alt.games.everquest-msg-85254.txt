EQ: Legends
(subtitle Test Server V.2.0)

The new GUI will probably be available on regular servers eventually, as
will a lot of the other 'carrots'. Surely it'd make sense to keep 50,000
accounts (ok 400,000 accounts, but realistically, say 50% are main &
active accounts, and 1/4 of them are impressed with the changes) people
happily playing $10, than hope for 8000 to pay $30 more?

I see the Legends server as a premium service partly financing new
additions to the game. Kinda like big business financing the space
program, It'll be used as a model both for EQ, and the larger picture of
future MMORPGs to answer the question: Will people pay more for more
'game'. What will the market support.  The price HAS to be that high to
reduce the numbers interested to a more manageable level to monitor.

There *will* be more CS staff on, and more events, but I would be very
surprised if any 'good ideas' <tm> such as GUI improvements, automaps,
and so on, didn't filter down to the regular servers if they're deemed
to make us regular monkeys happy. The sting in the tail of the idea is
that if people can see VI implementing these changes on the premium
server, it'll cause more bad feeling on the regular servers than if it
didn't exist at all.
