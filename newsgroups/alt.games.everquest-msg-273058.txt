If you can, also try memory other than Kingston. We've seen 
some strange anomalies with this brand lately at our office. 
  We recently doubled the memory on a dozen systems here, 
and Kingston RAM gave problems on half of them. These were 
identical systems. If it didn't work in one machine then we 
swapped. Funny thing is that once we swapped both systems in 
question worked fine. Could be variances in motherboard 
versions, BIOS's etc., but our second round of upgrades went 
with Corsair RAM and we had no problems at all.
