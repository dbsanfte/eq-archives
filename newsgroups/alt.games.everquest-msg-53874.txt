Well here is a little known secret once you get a few more levels under your
belt.  Head to Runnyeye and don't come out even if it's all green to you.  I
have spent the last week down there killing goblins, lord pickclaw, and the
other named stuff trying to make some cash.  In about 18 game hours I have
accumulated 2200pp from cash drops, item drops, and other things.  Most of
the goblins down there drop anywhere from 3-6pp each and the alloy armor
will fetch you at least 3-5pp from the built in vendors in the zone.  And if
it gets too heavy just run to the bank and drop off your excess cash.  Very
nice zone and hardly anyone is ever there.  95% of the time I am the only
one in the zone and I prefer it that way.
