To make matters worse on this issue, since the last couple of patches Verant
has dropped the loot on low level mobs in Ill Omen such as aggressors and
lesser charbones to where they mainly drop copper and silver coins now where
they previously dropped a generous mix of all coins.  The result is that
unless you have tremendous strength you quickly become overweight and have
to run the gauntlet of spiders to bank in FV which is not an easy matter if
you do not have sow and a reliable invisibility.
