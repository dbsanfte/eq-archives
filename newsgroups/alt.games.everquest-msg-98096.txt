    My enchanter played with Happy Star, a gnome that was celebrating his
birthday. He summoned us lots of Bristlebane's Party Packs (or whatever that
mage spell is), handed out cupcakes and Tegi Tickle Champagne, we all played
Spin the Bottle in unison at the WFP gates, then we played Hide and Seek
three times (I found him twice, got an insta-cast GHeal potion both times).
Nobody tried to attack the gnome, although an ogre shadow knight named
Boogers kept trying to sit on him.
