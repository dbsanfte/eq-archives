I think you're missing the whole point, here.  It IS as you say the 
parents responsibilty to influence their children.  It's also the 
parents responsibilty to monitor what their children are exposed to, 
to the best of their ability.  

Each kid is different.  Each situation is different.  Its not about 
locking your kids away in an isolation booth until they are 18.  Its 
about choosing what sort of things are appropriate for your children 
to be involved in as they mature.  I don't let either of my children 
play EQ.  My daughter is a very "together" 13 year old, who I would 
actually consider letting play, but she's not really interested.  My 
son is 11 and has an entirely different personality and maturity 
level.  He asks to play EQ (he's obsessed LOL) and I won't let him.  
Is it because I think EQ is a hotbed of moral decay?  Um no.  Its 
because right now he has enough on his plate trying to balance the 
"coolness" of being a jerk with his friends at school and in the 
neighborhood, with the uncoolness of having parents that actually 
discipline him.  He really doesn't need more.

Children don't stop learning and growing when they are 4.  They don't 
stop being impressionable.  You accuse Mike of being one of those 
parents blaming the environment.  But he is fact saying that the 
parents should take control of the situation.  

You are right when you say EQ won't influence children.  Neither will 
other games, TV shows, music etc.  In and of themselves they are 
totally benign.  However, the choices you make as parents in regards 
to what you allow your child to play, view or listen to, DOES 
influence them.  You are letting them know what you think is 
appropriate, or unappropriate, right and wrong, etc.  You are also 
steering them toward maturity by letting them know that they need to 
show they are ready for certain things.  Yes I know there are things 
my kids do at their friends house that I probably wouldn't allow.  I'm 
not stupid and was a kid myself. :-)  But they also know what I 
approve of and what I don't (I should say we), and why, and thats what 
will stick with them over time.

To just let you kid, regardless of age or personal maturity do 
whatever they want, is lazy and irresponsible at best.  At worst its 
child abuse.  Children want and need boundries and limits.
