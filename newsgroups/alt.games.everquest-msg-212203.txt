I'm sorry...  I must have misread.  Did you say "tanking" while talking
about a 53 ranger?  :P

Just tossing out some possibilities for you (and some *HUGE* price ranges).

Disembowler, Fleshgrinder, Swiftblade of Zek, Blade of Carnage, Curved
Claws, Blackened Acrylia Blade, Kunzar Tu'lal, Defender's Lightblade,
Longsword of Ethereal Energy, Fer'Esh Defender, Falchion of Storms, Windworn
Handlbade.

Some of those will run into the same issues of level restrictions, but some
of those have *no* level restrictions at all.

A disembowler with a defender's lightblade or longsword of ethereal energy
in the off hand would be a powerful combo at a bargain price.

Feartouched Greatsword, Blackened Greatsword, War Marshall's, Tae Ew
2-hander, Ganak...  and there's others, particularly at level 53, that are
better.
