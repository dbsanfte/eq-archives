Hi. Good story.

   I run a BL as well. Along with 7 other characters of assorted classes. My BL usually gets agro even over a warrior or ass. tank. 
Unless the warrior knows what he/she is doing and has DPS out the ass. Sorry to say (lest at my level.) BL heal sucks.
can't cast a nuke for jack. (ok. ya i need to sit an hour or so shooting off low level ones for skill but still.) But i agree there's no
 reason for not recasting pet unless it wasn't up.
