I get the feeling you are wrong.  making us hate eq would not drive us to
eq2, infact it wouldnt even make us hate eq, it would (and does, for some of
us) make us hate soe. I've stated a couple of times I never intend to buy
another product with the SOE stamp on it, after 3 days of not being able to
log in I imagine others are starting to reach that decission too.


its not neccessarily any single event that leads people to hate sony, its
just all the damn straws are really starting to get heavy
