Do you have a better system than they do?  Better connection?  Both
contribute somewhat.  My experiences have always been with local friends
with cable modems and similar computers (since I often end up building them
:p ).

Velious isn't quite a MINOR point...I'm pretty sure the first time you go to
Velious and visit Thurg in wolf form, you're KOS.
When you FINALLY hit dubious to CoV faction see what happens when you go
into wolf form (I don't know...I'm too afraid to find out since the only
outdoors test is Wuoshi, as far as I know, and I don't want to die :) ).

I'm sure it's probably possible to not be KOS in FV in wolf form, but that's
more faction work than I'm up for...we're talking days of faction work...not
minor.
