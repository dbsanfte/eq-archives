Try to get a shield for your offhand until you are able to dual wield.
You can get a cheap bow and arrows in Blackburrow off the gnolls there.  
Have you trained a point in taunt?  You need to practice your taunt key all the
time while you are soloing.  If a caster type is being attacked it is YOUR job
to get the monster off him.  If there is a warrior or bigger tank in  your
group you will be there for backup damage.  Do NOT taunt.  Warriors have more
hitpoints and better AC.
You need to practice sense heading just because Rangers are expected to know
how to get around.   Set up a /loc key too and understand how it works.   I'm
embarassed for rangers who haven't practiced their outdoor skills :)
What level are you?  At 3 you get forage.  Train a point in it.  I never have
to buy food or water, and alot of foraged stuff is used in tradeskilling.  You
can sell it.  
At 5 train a point in kick.  Practice it too.  
I have hot keys for all this stuff.
Have you been using your track key?  You'll find it invaluable later.  I
automatically hit it every time I enter a zone just to see what's "around".  I
usually have mine set to distance.  No running around aimlessly looking for the
next monster, you'll always know exactly where it is, and how to avoid it if
you need to.
At level 9 you get spells!  Start saving now.  Most important:  Snare, then
minor healing, then skin like wood, (that's in my opinion of course).  Using
snare slows the mobs and gives you a chance to run away if you are in trouble. 
That's a life saver :)
Good luck!
