What I do seems to be helping quite a bit (assuming it's a scheduled raid).

(I'm a guild leader)

About once every week or two I mention in passing that tardy people REALLY
PISS ME OFF.   I mention that people are INCONSIDERATE if they aren't at the
raid or at least at a druid/wiz portal at least 15 minutes before the raid
time.

Ok, at this point (after 6 months) I rarely have anyone who is late.  If
they DO show up late and are so inconsiderate to not even be in the same
freaking ZONE as a druid/wizard portal I tell them they can't go.

If a guild member says that they didn't know about the raid until today, I
tell them they can't go, and suggest they keep a closer eye on the message
board.  I'll be nice & let them attend if they can get to the raid location
within 5 minutes of logging on, assuming we haven't started buffing.

I am extremely nice about it.  I sound sincere in my apology that they can't
come.  I sound concerned for THEM if they don't keep up with the boards.  Of
course, in RL I'm venting to my best friend on the phone about how
inconsiderate the person is being.
