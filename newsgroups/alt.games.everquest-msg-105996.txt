Which brings up a point, why can't they fix this? With all of my other
characters, I have rarely noticed this but with my scared little druid I
tend to sit as far away as possible from the mob when regaining mana and it
is rather annoying to not be able to gauge, reasonably accurately, how much
force is required to finish it off. Like, should I use my level 29 dd spell
and 110 mana or scour my book for my level 1 dd spell and use 7 mana or
throw a dot and sit and relax till he drops or go up and risk slashing him a
bit to get my 1hs up. Ok, so I am naive, now tell me what I should be doing.
