From the Gaming Open Market FAQ:
'in-game commodity transactions are handled by meeting a GOM
representative (called an "associate") in your game'.

From the Everquest user agreement:
"You may not buy, sell or auction (or host or facilitate the ability
to allow others to buy, sell or auction) any Game characters, items,
coin or copyrighted material."

They may not be actually selling, but if not, they're certainly
facilitating the ability of others to do so.  So the activity is
prohibited by the agreement.  Since you meet a GOM representative
in-game, they must be playing the game, and thus they must have
accepted the user agreement.  So unless you want to argue that the
user agreement isn't binding, they (GOM) are breaking it.
