You are full of shit.

Oh the theory that you don't need to eat the whole egg to know it's rotten,
I'll deal with the very easy to disprove parts of your nonsense.

Jesus was a Jew.

If he was so stupid, how did he know which ideas to steal?

How would he know which ones to steal if he were so stupid?

Again, so what? One piece. Did Morley come up with the idea of velocity? No.
Science builds on past discoveries.

Lots of papers are published, some ground breaking, some full of what turns
out to be crap. If Einstein were so dumb, how did he pick out the right
ones?

"The ether" doesn't exist. If Einstein were plagiarizing, why didn't he
mention the ether?

No, it is not. The special theory of relativity doesn't say anything about
the length of bodies changing.

And any physics text will tell you the Special Theory was in agreement with
what was known at the time.

Um, increase of mass, shortening of length, and time dilation are not part
of the Special Theory of Relativity.

Like I said, there is no need to eat the whole egg to know it is rotten. So,
I'm snipping the rest.
