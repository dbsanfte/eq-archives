Hmm, you need to think completely different for EQ.
Everquest is a persistant world. That means that the world will exist even
if no players are online. Monster will wander around and merchants will wait
for someone to pass by.
Because of this there is no such thing as random terrain. Only very rarely a
certain zone is changed via a patch and even then the geography usually
stays the same. Also note that there is no in-game mapping system. But the
fact that a zone remains the same allows players to make their own maps
(check out www.eqatlas.com).

Monsters are sort of random in that there are some spots in which a monster
can spawn (suddenly appear) and there are different monsters that can on
that spot. Named spawns are special monsters that normally only appear at 1
spawn point and generally have special loot (which is random in that you
have a chance that it drops on that monster, but it can only drop on THAT
monster. If you want it, you kill the monster a few times.)

Some examples:

The Shiny Brass Shield is an item only dropped by the Orc Trainer, who
spawns just north-west of the campfire on Trainer Hill in Clan Crushbone and
stays at that spot. Every time you kill him you get roughly 10% chance that
he drops the shield. But if you want the shield you have to kill him, no
other orc / monster drops it.

A Rusty Shortsword is an uncommon drop of Spiderlings, Orc Pawns, Bees and
Fire Beetles (to name a few :). Typically they all have the same spawn
points, but considering there are so many points and these mobs start
wandering around as soon as they pop (spawn) it's no good "camping" a
specific location. If you want a Rusty Shortsword, you just kill all of
these monsters lots of times, they all have about equal chance to drop it.


Hope I made things a bit more clear. EQ is a lot slower and requires more
thinking overal. It's not a fast and furious game like D2 and there is
practically no class that totally outbalances the game (Like I saw
WW-barbarians do and after a patch or two the sorceresses.
