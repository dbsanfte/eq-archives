Agree with Dan, but:

Re: dying, fighting near a zoneline is usually a survival guarantee.  At 17
I was in highpass hold fighting gnolls.  Instead of relying on the ole'
Captain to save me, though, I fought next to the zoneline to East Karana at
the end of the pass.  For future endeavors, go with the Arena at Lake Rathe
(zoning into the Arena) and then stick near the zonelines in dungeons.
