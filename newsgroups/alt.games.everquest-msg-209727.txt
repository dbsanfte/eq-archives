Yah i complained about Druids having the biggest Ice nuke in the game which
is totally unacceptable, and they also have the biggest AE spell which is
also totally unacceptable. Ofcourse none of these are as mana efficient as
the wizard spells.. but on raids you are seldom 00m anyway except when you
engage the big boss mob so mana efficiency isnt really an issue until then.
This scenario is unacceptable and clearly shows SOE lack of class balancing.

I'm complaining about the mana efficiency of a higher level spell... since
thats what SOE deems as more beneficial if you take a look at their spell
design thruout the game. I'm also doing this so SOE sees that we "are aware"
of them trying to indirectly "nerf" and hope they fix the spell before its
released (which is usually the case and definately hope so in this case
too).
