Rubbish. Tank1 has been working his socks off for the guild, and his new
BP will benefit the raid every time he's MTing. The guild kills more,
kills faster, kills safer, and kills bigger targets, meaning more loot
all round.

If an individual feels that something is good for the guild, but not
good for them personally, and that is reason enough to have a strop and
walk out, good riddance to them.
