Hehe you think YOU are leveling slow? I have 2 characters going on 2 and a
half years and they have just hit 20 and 21.  If you are in the
game for power leveling, you will miss some of the more fun zones and parts
of the game.  But, if you REALLY have a bug for leveling faster,
first you have to hit some of the websites and check out which zones give
more experience in the game. Some time ago Verant made some
of the less-popular zones more rewarding in experience. They also made
grouping more rewarding. Find a good group that is within 2 levels
up or down from you, and enter a good exp zone (my favorite is Lake of ill
Omen).  Make sure you have 6 people in the group and try to get
at least 1 enchanter and 1 druid (for breeze/traffic control and sow/buffs)
This will help you reduce the downtime that slows down leveling.

Or method #2 (the cheesiest) is find a friendly high level character (or pay
one to be friendly) and have them help you solo reds.  The problem
with this is that most fights last a LONG time even with their help. The
quicker pace of a group more than makes up for sharing the experience
with a group (IMHO).

Good luck and Good hunting
