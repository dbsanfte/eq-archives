Finally, another Tarrew Marr-er!  I'd run into High Keep if I weren't 
scared to death of it.  As it is everytime I run to Halas my level 49 
friend says "Don't go in High Keep, you'll die."

As for killing the piranhas, hey, they always START the fights!  :)  Most 
agro-ist things I've ever seen in the game.  And hey, I'm only there once 
every few weeks :)  The rest of the time I'm legging it to Halas and back 
seeing what I can kill at the new level.

Oh, and did you experience a LOT of lag yesterday?  It was so bad I 
couldn't play - the one time I DID try to play, I ran to hand in some 
derv rings to the named orc in south ro.  I ran through an orc camp, had 
two greenies aggro on me, so I started fighting - all of a sudden lag 
kicked in, and when it kicked out, my health went from full to less than 
half a bubble.  Needless to say, I died very pissed off.  I'm hoping the 
lag is gone today so I can go get my revenge.
