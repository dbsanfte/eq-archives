It's good that you don't simply believe my assertion, far too
much misinformation about EQ has been propagated by people
who read[heard] it "somewhere".  You've been reading TSW, so
search it for the melee aggro test results.  Also, search
Graffes (wizard board) and, if you enjoy wading through the
on-line equivalent of raw sewage in search of the occasional
bit of "gold", look for test/parse info at shadowknight.org.

A brief summary of what I found some time back (no I didn't
save any links):

First off the mark in aggro testing were the Wizards.  Using
2 equal level Wizards ping-ponging a high HP mob by taking
turns casting the same nuke, the mob always switched targets
on each cast, regardless of resist, partial resist, or
critical.  There were other tests, including some that pretty
well debunked the popular myth that aggro decays, though I
don't recall the particulars.

These results intrigued a pair of melee players, a Warrior
and an SK, who devised a pretty decent test of melee aggro:
The SK would use an SK pure hate spell with a known fixed
+hate value on a mob he had proximity aggro on, keeping his
back to the mob.  A relatively low level alt Warrior (more
or less level appropriate for the mob being tested) then
attacked the mob until it turned.  The result was that, for
any given weapon, the number of swings required to turn the
mob was constant regardless of the number of hits or actual
damage done (and there was a great deal of variance in hits
and damage).

Testing with a variety of weapons showed +hate per swing was
proportional to the base damage + (level based) bonus damage
of the weapon, with a bonus multiplier for 2 hand weapons
and a negative "bonus" multiplier for off-hand attacks.

To my knowledge it has not been tested whether your ATK
rating affects melee aggro, tho I suspect it has at least
some impact based on what I've seen of people trying to tank
with very low weapon skills.

Note that, as the dominant factor is base dmg + bonus dmg,
with no direct multiplier for base dmg, there is not a
direct correlation between DPS and and melee aggro.  This
is because average damage per hit = (base*X)+bonus, where
X is affected by your ATK rating vs. the mob's AC rating
(and also appears to be affected by your level relative to
the mob) while bonus dmg remains constant per hit.  As X
is typically around 2.0 at mid-levels and can exceed 4.0
for some classes at high levels the observed +hate formula
weights bonus damage higher than observed DPS effects.
