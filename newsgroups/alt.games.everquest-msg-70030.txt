Ok. 2 questions:  

1) Dan, What processor are you using?

and 

2) What resolution are you both playing at? If 1024x768 isn't going to
be playable in Luclin (its currently a slideshow at that resolution
with my MX) with the Geforce 2 ti 64 meg and my current processor
then I'll just wait and get a Geforce 3 when I upgrade cpu/mobo/memory
with my tax refund.

thanks,

Scott H.
