Naw, I've been around. Just don't post as much these days, but I still 
skim the group for interesting threads. Still playing. Couple of level 
sixty five characters waiting patiently for OoW to come out so they can 
get to level 70 and hold THERE for a couple years.

*sigh*

Mostly I'm curious about what sort of stuff my necro/cleric partner and 
I will be able to duo at level seventy that we can't now. (Two real 
people, but four toons... wizard, warrior, necro, cleric.)
