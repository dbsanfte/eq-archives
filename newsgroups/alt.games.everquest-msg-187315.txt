Level 42 bard here on Brell.  Just made my way over to the Dreadlands
this morning and I was thinking of trying to get a group in Karnor's
Castle.  Do you all think there is a chance a group may pick me up
because of my mana song and group buffing abilities or should I not
waste my time?

I'd love to fight in other zones like City of Mist or other dungeons
but I'm a very casual player (2 hours a week) and it's hard to get a
pickup group there.

The Gulf of Gunthak has been OK for groups but I'm really interested
in dungeons.

Where are the majority of people hunting these days between 40-45? 
Are there any dungeons in this level range where it's easy to get a
pick up group in?
