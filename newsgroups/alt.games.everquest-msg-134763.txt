Wow, who cares?  Clerics are to dots what necro's are to heals.

I think the "buff" Complete that they're excluding is the Donal's BP (which
is actually a positive exclusion)

Who cares about stats, just swap it out if you want to when you cast,
otherwise keep them at the normal duration.  (I love enchanters with EE3 and
the AA EE skill when I get KEI off them, 4 hour KEI /drool)

Supple Scale armband has no SvM, 10 SvF, 5 wis (25 mana), but no SvM,
agreed, the AC sucks though.  Most of my Ext Range 3 experiences where it
really comes in handy are druid specific though  (lumi staff usage in
particular).

You'll have to compete with a LOT of other people for an Imp Dmg 3 item,
particularly wizards, druids and mages who tend to nuke a lot, as opposed to
clerics, who in most raid situations are healing.

It's increased healing, not healing efficiency. =p  Definitely superior for
druid or shaman usage (though it doesn't work with Torpor or Nature's
Recovery either)

Because CH is already blatantly unbalancing as the most mana efficient heal
bar none, making it even MORE efficient would just suck any semblance of
balance away (I do hope you were being sarcasting there).  Still a very nice
effect, and useful for mana intensive group buffs or nuke efficiency also.
I wouldn't sell my Obulus Shroud for under 20k (obviously it's not for
sale).

Not very useful, sure, but if you've got the item and want to save a little
money, swap it in when you Aego or Symbol, then swap it back out.

Highly competitive effect though, EVERY caster and most hybrids are going to
want it.

Um.  Yay?
