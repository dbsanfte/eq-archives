I can't mess em up either. It knows what the date is and by god its
going to make sure its right! :-)

Here's an example of someone whos server doesn't correct their
mistakes, however (like Taras's):

6MqdnSY_4IhM2NzdRVn-jQ@comcast.com

The next post down he apologizes for setting his year to 2005.

It actually happens pretty often. I guess people set their time wonky
to fool some programs into not updating or something. Never seen
anyone behave like a stepped-on cat like Taras did when someone
notices and jokes about it, though....
