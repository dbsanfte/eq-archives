The first time I ever seriously priced computer memory,
contemplating buying some, a 4K board was $112.00. (Mid-1970's)

Now, 512MB of PC133 SDRAM DIMM can be had for $36.

That means that my first memory price check was FOUR HUNDRED
THOUSAND times more expensive than today's memory.

Looked at another way, that 512MB which costs $36
today would have cost $14.6 million dollars in the mid-1970's.

The mind boggles.
