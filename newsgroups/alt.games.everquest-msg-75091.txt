Netherbian Lair in Luclin. You can choose between the Netherbians,
Troglodytes, oir Fungoids. All drop up to 4 plat 9gold at a time that I have
seen, and they are EASY to kill at your level. You will even get pretty good
exp for the next few levels bashin on these guys. Keep your eye open for the
Swarm Leader who drops a AC20 +2str
+10 (?) resist. The Trog King drops an AC8 +3 wis legs for SHM and BST. Trog
bulls drop weapons that sell like bronze, and there are other little drops
all over.
I still go there once in a while at level 40 to cash in...I thought Sol A
was a cash cow..this is even better!
