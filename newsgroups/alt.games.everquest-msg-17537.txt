I've just picked up a second computer (which I plan to install Linux
on) and want to network it with my main machine (which runs Win2K
Pro). The 'new' computer is only a P166 (got it for $15, I'm not
complaining) and the planned configuration will be the W2K box as the
host for the DSL connection and the Linux machine as the client. My
question is, can internet connection sharing and EQ coexist happily at
the same time? Will I be able to play EQ and browse the web on the
Linux machine? Or would I be better off making the Linux machine the
host and running the W2K box as the client? Thanks.
