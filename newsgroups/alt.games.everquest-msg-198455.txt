Sure, they could quit playing alts, they could play more than a few
hours a week, etc.  In short, they could turn their "family" guild into
a raiding guild.   That would dramatically improve their chances.
Of course, they wouldn't be the "family"-type guild we've been
talking about any more, either.

Right.  As I pointed out, they could all turn into "level"-driven
people.  That's obviously unlikely to happen.

As far as "what changes," it's the level-effect, not the trials.  The
people who *can* pass the trials are the people who tend to be
more interested in levels than the rest of the guild.  The *only*
reason to pass the trials to to play in the keyed zones.  So they
pass the trials, they play in the keyed zones, they level PAST
the ability to group for (decent) XP anywhere outside of PoP.
And, realistically, they're not going to be real happy outside of
the keyed zones anyway, in terms of pure XP.  It's the difference
between playing in Paludal and Crushbone at level 20;  you will
get XP in both spots, but if you're playing for XP, you're not going
to stay in Crushbone long, right?   Killing light-blues isn't a lot of
fun for anyone, IMO, day-in and day-out.

*Most* 60s don't belong to "raiding" guilds.  They belong to "casual"
guilds.
There was *zero* reason to leave a guild with a level 50 requirement
once you hit 60 and couldn't "level" anymore (unless you wanted to join
a raiding guild.)   Someone who didn't want to dedicate his life to raiding
could still rack up AAXP pretty well at 60 grouping in Seb, for instance,
with the rest of the group being all level 50s.

That *changes* for people who pass the trials.  They're now in tier-2
planes, getting *great* XP, and *everywhere* outside of PoP is *green*
for the most part.  THAT is the pressure point.   Do those (soon-to-be
65s) players want to stay in the guild?  Sure, if the rest of the guild can
catch up.  But that's not likely to happen for casual guilds.  If it was,
they'd
all be 60s anyway and wouldn't have the problem in the first place.
