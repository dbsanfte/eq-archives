Hi everyone,

I have a level 3 High Elf Cleric and have been fighting outside of
Felwithe.  I've been collecting the bone chips from the skeletons I'm
fighting and then I turn them into the Cleric guildmaster for some
extra experience.  But I don't get any experience anymore.  I used to
get some, but now the experience bar doesn't move.  Someone there said
that the latest patch made it so that quests in a city don't give
experience anymore.  Is that true?

-C
