Be aware that once you go wireless you open yourself to the possibility of
interference problems. I spent 6 years living on Air force bases so have a
deep aversion to using anything wireless. Radios, Television, even Walkmans
used to get a whole shitload of interference every time a F111 flew overhead
with it's terrain following radar on and you could hear each revolution of
the bases main radar dish on any stero system, even if it was playing a cd.
There is enough interference around to cause grief to cable networks (mobile
phone left near the PC anyone?)  let alone upping the odds by using wireless
gear.
