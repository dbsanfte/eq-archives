Well, if you look at the level of my Paladin, you might see why I find Cease
to be nearly useless right now.  I did go back and look it up after I posted
and saw the cast time on it, and was surprised, based on the almost complete
utility I had found for it.  I guess, if I get around to levelling him
significantly higher, I will likely change my mind regarding it's utility,
but at the level you get it, it is damned near useless.
