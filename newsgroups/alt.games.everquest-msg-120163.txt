Absolutely perfect and gets right to the very core of why I like cats so
much - yet look at dogs and think "you poor stupid buggers". I also tend to
think that dogs at heart have the character of a male, whislt a cat has the
character of a female. Us blokes are pretty stupid with the crud we put up
with time and time again, whilst girls tend to be a lot more switched on and
smarter about life in general.

You own a dog - a cat owns you ; )
