Then your memory is faulty.
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_naming_policy.jsp

Per the naming policy:
The following types of names are inappropriate:.
rule 4 Trademarked names of products, services, or concepts (e.g. ,
Marlboro, Sony, Band-Aid).
AND
rule 5: Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can
be either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g.
Garth Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan).

Garfield violates both rules. The fact that the char was a Vah Shir
(Im betting orange and black?) seals any reasonable dispute as to the
intent of the reference.

And don't try to say "Garrfield" is different...

Per the naming policy:
For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the
word or words are also unacceptable.

DT is always in a bad mood ;-)

Its in violation of both the naming policy in places,  and an
infringement on the "Garfield" trademark. Reasons don't get better
than that.

You won't be purchasing any products from anyone then, if you expect
to walk around as an orange and black feline named Garfield.

As to the rest of the names:
Braska Yuyevon (Final Fantasy X name),

rule 10: Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from
popular existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Drizzt,
Tanis).

And Sefiroth:

rule 3: Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin
(e.g. Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin, Angel, Devil, Demon).

see:
Sephiroth: Cabalism, at least in the Western occult tradition, is
built around a diagram called the Tree of Life. This diagram contains
ten circles representing the Sephiroth (singular: Sephirah); that is,
the "spheres," "numbers," or "emanations." The Sephiroth are the
numbers 1 through 10 considered in their archetypal sense. Each
Sephirah is an archetypal idea. Also, the Sephiroth represent
emanations from God and describe the process of creation. In the
material world, they represent the heavenly spheres according to the
classical conception.
