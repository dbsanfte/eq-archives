Because of Mythic's rabid nerfing most classes now only have one or
two possible non-gimped methods of advancement. Some classes have
NONE. Even better, if you choose one of the good paths, it might be
too good and be nerfed into oblivion reducing your character to
WORTHLESSNESS, and I mean that literally. Smite cleric anyone?

Mythic redefined nerfing far past anything Verant did. By *miles*.

There are many places and many different mobs with different
characteristics to fight in EQ.

There are not in DAoC. The skins are almost all the same, and there is
so little content its like leveling in NK/SK all the way to 60 (if
that was possible).

Heard of how in EQ you could go 1-60 on nothing but frogloks? In DAoC
you don't have a CHOICE.

Not for the better. It's ruled by stealthers and mez. Skill? Tactics?
There's none of it. It's who gets their mez in first, and thats that.
Couple that with the fact the realms don't have equal power in mezzing
and its no wonder on many of the servers some realms are virtually
empty of players.

But even worse - there is no *point* to RvR. The keeps are
meaningless. The realm points are meaningless. The relics are
meaningless.

The CS is widely considered the worst of all the mmorpgs. The only way
someone will respond is if you're stuck in geometry - serious problems
go unanswered for.. well, forever. They have a lovely little "queue"
that shows your place. You can be #1 and go hours and hours before
getting any help, if you actually get any at all.

But there's also the other side. They will make arbitrary decisions
AGAINST players without ever bothering to get their side of it. In EQ
if you had a namae petitioned you would be offered the chance to pick
a new one (unless it was racial etc). In DAoC you can have your name
changed because some GM took a dislike to it - no rule broken - and
they may never tell you, just leaving you to notice on your own.

And remember, if you think EQ's is like this - people paid more per
month for the supposedly superior DAoC customer service. It was the
purpurted reason behind the $12.95 monthly fee.

I have. I never will again.

They have all the same problems of EQ, most of them in a worse form,
and added a bazillion more on top of them. Then they complicated it by
making the game obscenely boring because of lack of content or point,
a level grind that puts most people out of their misery by L35 (it
takes approximately 650 solo kills to go L35-36 in DAoC. That is three
times worse than L51 in EQ, and the real grind in DAoC doesn't start
until 41). On top of that they have a developer that doesn't know what
to do to fix anything (mez wrecking RvR? Add more mez!) and a PR
person that apparently still plays EQ to the point she is mixing EQ's
and DAoC's mechanics up.

>And btw Soloing is not treated as a red headed step child  but a valid
>type of play.

Soloing is so mindnumbing for most classes it simply isn't a valid
type of play unless you like spending days apon days of /played time
getting one level to the next. See above.

Add to that the bizarre mechanical problems in DAoC's game system -
sometimes a regular mob spawns that simply can't be beaten. No reason
given, it just resists everything, never gets hit and always hits.
Like random pointless deaths? Add to that BAF - bring a friend. It's
the supposedly superior DAoC mob AI that means you can actually make
your group WORSE by adding someone to it, because now the mob will
bring more. Not in a logical fashion, it just aggroes more mobs.

For the only game that came out a generation after the big three
(excluding sci fi AO) DAoC appears to have learned very little, and
their failure to attract a large part of the playerbase is highly
revealing.
