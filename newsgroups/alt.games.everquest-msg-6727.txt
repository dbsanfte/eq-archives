I have a level 11 wizard, tonnes of people have told me that they are uber
hard to get to high levels. Would I be better off making a new charachter?
If so what?
If i stick with my wizard through hell and high water, will it be super
badass at level 50?
I would like to be able to solo with my wizard at some point in time, will
this ever happen or is a wiz a group charachter all its life?
Info gratefully welcomed
