This has to go in the "I never thought I'd see" file

I quit playing EQ a couple months ago, and now my wife is complaining 
about that.

Seems she thinks I was less bored, was less in danger of getting 
depressed (mind you I haven't been depressed since quitting, but I did 
have some bouts with it before I started playing regularly), and had 
more friends when I was playing.

It seems my claims, which fell on deaf ears for years, that the people I 
was playing with were real humans, just because they happened to be 
located across the country or across the ocean from me, finally sunk in.

I guess, too, that this is similar to the complaint wives have about 
husbands who retire, and hang out around the house being annoying 
because they haven't got anything to do.

I'm not sure I want to do anything about this really, I'm enjoying my 
vacation from MMOGing... but perhaps there's something to what she's 
saying.  The best part of not playing MMOG's, though, is the ability to 
walk away from the computer any time with a moment's notice; if I'm 
hanging out on usenet I can walk away mid sentence, if I'm playing a 
single player game there's a pause button.  In EQ, I had to worry about 
where I was and what was going on, had to finish any fight I was in and 
get to a safe place to log out; if grouped, I had to worry about what 
walking away would do to the other people (who I've already said are, 
after all, real people behind their toons) in my group.

Something that worked decently for me in EQ1 was to play a character who 
could solo, and to solo when there was a chance I might want to "walk 
away" (kids awake, waiting on business call, so on) and group when I 
could be reasonably sure I would be online for a couple hours.

I really think I've tired of EQ1, though, even with the possibility of 
starting over with a new toon on a new server.  I leveled up to the 
point where I didn't care to level any further enough times that the 
lure of leveling up is sort of lost on me, and it was leveling up that I 
enjoyed most!

What does that leave, in terms of the other MMOG's out there now?  I 
think I'll start a thread on that and leave this one for the oddity of 
being asked to start playing -something- again!

Lance
