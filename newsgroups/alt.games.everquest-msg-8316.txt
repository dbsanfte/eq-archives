OK, how about this: when you retire your first high level character, you
will either twink your next serious character, or quit Everquest, or you
are very easily amused.

The pace of EQ is designed around someone playing their first serious
character.  When you are on your second or third, the pace seems very
slow until that character gets up to levels approaching your first
character.  Hence, any normal person who doesn't quit the game twinks
the secondary characters to get them up to the interesting levels
faster.

What you've failed to realize is that when you start a second character,
try as you might to not twink, there is one thing you *cannot* avoiding
giving that second character from your first: *your* knowledge of the
game and your experience.
