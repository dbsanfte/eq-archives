Your original statement was more ambiguous.

You're still not making it clear if you are referring to original
meaning or contemporary usage.   If you go strictly by original
meaning, then your use of "homosexual" is incorrect and meaningless.

With the accompanying disruptions every time, and the further
weakening of our Charter rights.

You have the same voice you always did.  You vote, have the ability to
contact your elected representative, form lobby groups, etc.  Unless
you wish to live in a country without laws then you will have to live
with legislation being "shoved" down your throat if a majority of
parliament approves it.  If you want a more direct influence run for
office, join a party, or work with a political organization.

Yes.

So, you object to government "shoving" legistlation down your throat,
but you support the removal of your rights?   Seems inconsistent.

Yes, that is one of the few times Section 33 has been used.  I'll
leave it to a constituional lawyer to explain why that worked.

Ok then.... maybe we should stick to one issue at a time, and leave
the various other beefs you have with our government for other
discussions?

Look up Haig & Birch v Canada (Attorney General) (1992).  The
government has never appealed, nor have they legislated, any change to
the court's ruling that sexual orientstion is implicitly included in
Section 15(1).     The precedent has since become firmly entrenched.

IIRC correctly the Human Rights Act was amended in 1996.

> This is interesting, do you have a link to the story ?

Yes, unfortunately details are few.

http://cbc.ca/stories/2002/07/27/marriage_fed020727

I'm trying to find out if this is based on a press release- if so I
would like to see that press release to get more details.

Why bother?   Your position is set in stone, and its a moot point to
me.

As of Jan. 1, 2001, Canada considers same-sex couples to have
common-law status in every way.   All legislations have been updated
reflect the new definition of common-law status. The legistlation uses
the term "common-law partner" in the Income Tax Act, IIRC, but I
believe some other statutes use "common-law spouse".     Both are used
interchangeably in publications.  (This is another case where you need
to indicate if you care more for etymology or contemporary use when
deciding nomenclature.)

Ok, then why did you bring them up in the first place?

Much like most of us will never get veteran's benefits, disability
insurance, etc....   So what percentage of the population needs to
benefit for you to approve?  Are you then willing to cut off any
benefits that apply to a population lower than that percentage?   And
if, for the sake of argument, a census showed that gay, lesbian, and
bisexual Canadians numbered above that percentage of yours, would you
reverse your position?

Alberta has roughly 10% of the Canadian population.... should the
federal government not give money to Alberta, because it does not
directly benefit the other 90% of the country?

> I just don't think it's in the best

I got that, I just don't feel you have really proved it.

When I came out 12 years ago it was a challenge to be gay and out.
The other option was to stay closeted and suffer the stress and hassle
that go with lying and hiding every day- no thanks!

Today much has changed, with no worsening in the "interests of the
country".  It is still a hassle to be in a same-sex relationship,
although not as much as it used to be.  I can't speak for anyone but
myself, but I don't care much one way or another about marriage- it is
not an institution I have ever wanted or supported.  Like everyone
else I just want the freedom to enjoy my life without undue hassle-
whether applying for a mortgage, home improvement loan, making a will,
or just going on vacation.

I have many friends who are more "traditional" and feel the need to
get married, legitimize their relationships, and give their families
the fun of a wedding.  For them this is a big deal, and I understand
that.   I think that if same-sex couples are allowed to marry you
would see no more visible change in society than you saw on Jan. 1,
2001.

> and don't
> believe the denial of same sex marriages constitutes discrimination.

Since that depends a great deal on your definition of what a marriage
is, I ask honestly why not?
