Heh.   I've been KoS to Ring of Scale for so long that it is almost odd to me
to hear someone say they're not ; )  Almost made a post to correct you, then
remembered that I actually did start off on good terms, especially after
spending my late 30's in Mistmoore.    Way too many epics that require dragon
killing...
