Depends on who you talk to.  Some people say 60%, some say 20%, some say it 
just takes a raw 6 points of delay off your bow.

It's hard to take a parse of this because there's no auto-fire type thing, 
so it's highly dependent on the person sitting at the keyboard hitting the 
range attack button in a timely manner to get an accurate picture.  The 
time between hits is also dependent on your distance from the mob (root and 
shoot would help to eliminate this factor).

I can say from experience that 60% haste seems way off, since I upgraded 
from my tailored quiver to fleeting quiver (last week I think) I'm not 
shooting *that* much faster; would be like the difference between swinging 
a sword unhasted and having some higher end enchanter haste on you.

In my case, with bow delay at 38 or so, 6 points reduction in delay and 20% 
haste are too close for me to tell apart without a parse, but one of 'em 
seems like it would be right.  I suppose with a much higher delay bow it 
would be more apparent.
