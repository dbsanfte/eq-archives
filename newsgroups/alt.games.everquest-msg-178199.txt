Or you can take the third option, realising that this Life is for learning 
about your own Divine Nature, and put those silly fears behind you. 

Love isn't about eternal torment, friend. How can you worship a god so 
petty that he requires you to subordinate your will to him, or suffer 
damnation? That's not love; that's barganing like a child to avoid bedtime.

Fortunately, the Goddess ACTUALLY loves us all _unconditionally_.  Nothing 
you can do will seperate you from Her. She does not require your worship, 
or even your belief, to rain down Her blessings on you. Like a Mother, she 
loves you even if you don't love Her.

THAT is what divine nature is about. Boundless forgiveness and 
unconditional love. No damnation, no need for forgiveness. No Ragnarok, no 
End Times, no Divine retribution, no Hell. No stoning of sinners, no 
burning of unbelievers, no putting Her enemies to the sword and taking 
their wives and daughters as slaves. No plagues of Death, no unholy human 
sacrifices, no self-tourture and mortification of the flesh. Just Love. 

Imagine it. Pure and divine love, no charge, no conditions. Now THAT is a 
Goddes worthy of worship!  :)
