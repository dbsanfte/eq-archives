I don't mean playing less because Verant has been taking the servers
down quite a bit more often lately! 

But at least in my case, first I didn't play because I was having the
black box problem (now fixed); then I would play, then see the message
saying that all the servers would be going down in 2 hours or
whatever.  Fine, no problem.  I'd play for a little more, then I'd
start doing something else and go to bed, then the next evening after
work I'd do something else and eventually come here and read the
newsgroup and see people complaining about such and such servers still
being down and no ETA, and how their server crashed while they were in
the middle of raiding Fear or whatever, and I would actually find
myself feeling relieved that I hadn't been playing earlier that night.

I think the last time I played was Friday morning for maybe about two
hours.  Is it just me or does anyone else find themselves playing LESS
EQ lately, maybe waiting till Verant gets the bugs worked out with
SoL?

(obviously not everyone is playing less, noting the level 40
beastlords out there!)
