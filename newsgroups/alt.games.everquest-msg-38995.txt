Depending on whether you: a) don't mind the basic chainmail look b) have no
problem waiting around to loot no drop items and c) are a medium-sized race,
I'd recommend some Jarsath Scale armor from Karnor's Castle.  It's got
decent AC (better than Fine Plate for the most part; in fact, the leggings
are actually higher AC than Crafted) and some nice stats at very, very low
weights (0.4 - 0.8 wt).  Three of the pieces (helm, leggings, and bracer)
add Wisdom (a total of 11 Wisdom on all three).

Best of all...people let it rot! (It's No Drop and Lore) That's right, just
stroll in and announce that you're trying to loot some Jarsath and you'll
start picking up pieces.
