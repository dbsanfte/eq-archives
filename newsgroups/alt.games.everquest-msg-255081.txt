Your party member was an idiot then.

Critical hits have not been unique to warriors since Luclin came out.  Every
melee class has critical hit AA's in Archtype skills, and more in the PoP
abilities section.  It's actually more strange to see a melee who isn't
doing them.

And as far as I know, bezerkers did not gain crippling blows, which _are_
unique to warriors.
