What research did you get that info from??

It's a far cry from what I read..

My take is that the US spy ship was close enough to to obtain and
relay critical defenesive and offensive information to the Israeli
enemies.

The fact that the US had no intention of doing that is not relevant.

That ship was a clear and present danger to the Israeli offensive. It
was in a war zone and had the potential to aide the enemy.

That made it a legitimate target.

I am curious..

Why do you think it was attacked??
