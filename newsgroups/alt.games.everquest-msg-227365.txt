So we're talking about two different things.   For you, it appears that
anything resulting in you getting the item is the only disireable result you
see.   For me, it's as much about how you get it as having it at all.

Almost every single piece of gear my warrior wears has a story attached to
it.  If you asked about his offhand "low aggro" sword, I could tell you
about Ashorty, and the first public raids he ever ran on E'ci.  The fight
with Sontalak and the fight a few days later with the Statue of Rallos Zek.
If you asked about my helmet, I would tell you about Manjuk and how we
raided into Kael together, both trying to get those helms since they looked
so awesome on dwarves.   If you asked about the bow in my range slot, I
could tell you about Silvermist and Mynar, who were one of the best druids
and one of the best enchanters ever to play the game, and how we fought
through hordes of Sarknaks, wandering through Chardok at will until one of
them dropped it.

If you asked about my rogue's offhand dagger...  well, I'd just respond
"2.3k in the bazaar.   Nice deal, eh?  You should think about picking one up
for yourself, can't beat Vengence II"

Yes, you do, if you want to convince me that I'm wrong.   As I said earlier
in the thread, I feel it makes this a much better game when you actually
kill the things that drop your upgrades.   I believe its more fun, and I act
on that, whether it is in my personal "best interest" or not.

I thought that was quite obvious.  Once again, me.   I've stated many times
what I think the desireable result is.  If you'd like, I can paste it in as
well, so you don't have to search for it.

"Killing a mob and getting an item that you will actually use is fun.   It's
a rare and special moment, that happens all too infrequently in EQ.
Turning every drop into the equivalent of vendor trash would make it a much
poorer game


I'd much rather kill Vanikki and take a Willsapper off his still warm
corpse, and use it to kill the next creature and the next one and the next
after that, instead of looting some caster robe, setting up a vendor and
waiting for it to sell at an outragouesly high price, then waiting around
for some caster to sell the same weapon to me at an equally outrageous
price.    Thats just not the kind of game I want to play."
