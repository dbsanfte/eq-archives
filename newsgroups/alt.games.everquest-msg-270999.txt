Fully extended KEI lasts for 4ish hours, with that long a buff, it was 
not much of a pain to go get a refresh in PoK, always readilly available 
back then.  Seriously, many people would not go anywhere to hunt unless 
they had a KEI and Aego or Virtue.  They really and trully did not learn 
how to play their classes as a result.  For me, it was a blast at the 
time, as I did not bother with getting the buffs, only times I had them 
on my low level characters were drive by buffs, or catching the odd MGB.  
In that case, I spent lots of time without them, and did learn something 
about playing the various classes, and just had a blast going on a 
killing spree the few times I had the buffs.

The only time I can remember paying for a KEI for my baby enchanter was 
when I wanted to enchant lots of clay or gold, in which case, the extra 
mana regen was a godsend.
