Scavenger!

Hehe...  So says the person who had a cleric and asking a high level necro
if I could loot his druid kills in EC. :)

One of the keys to making money is find the right places.  For instance,
Druids, once they hit 19th level...  They are a god send to South Karana
Paw and Treant Hunters because the closest bank is either in High Keep or
in Qeynos and that is a long run from South Karana for change banking.  At
5% or 10% take of the loot, so if they give you pounds of gold silver and
copper and give them 90 to 95% in PP, they can fight longer without having
to leave.  For the Paw groups, buying their FS for 3 to 4pp to free up
weight and space for other things and the usually sell for about 3 to 5,
maybe upwards to 6 pp at the vendors if you have good enough cha.  And mind
you, this is a druid.

If you are a lower level, maybe hanging out at the Druid Ring in EC or WC,
where Necros tend to hack at the druids.  Some times, the Necros do it for
XP more than loot, and they will let you loot their kills if you are polite
and if you are a healing class, healing them after their fights, they will
thank you for it as well, given that health is mana for them.

The important thing to remember is how to milk a certain place for certain
things.  Scavenging kills you make or someone leaves out there is a good
thing, because at low levels, penny pinching means a higher coin later.

My druid does not ditch copper, because even 1k cp == 1 pp.  May not seem
like much, but the other levels of the copper, say, 936, yeah, it is heavy,
but that means 9 gold, 3 silver...  Add to it, the 123 silver and the 56
gold you might already have, that makes 126 silver, 65 gold, which comes
out to being 7 plat, 7 gold and 6 silver. It adds up after a while and
while it seems silly to carry crap loads of copper as well, one of the
important things about copper is it is a cheap give test to, like in
Crushbone where you have to figure out what key you need.  Of course at low
levels, money is everything as far as saving up.

Some of the crap I have hunted, I kept a large portion of what I can sell
off, mostly because every little cp helps towards buying that spell or
armor piece I need.  So depending on your character, penny pinching helps
in a jiff, especially Druid and Wizard classes that have the option to port
around.
