Not true.  Many players base the decision to seek new hunting grounds
rate at which they are gaining experience.  Prior to the current xp
bonus many would start looking elsewhere at lower levels than they
now do.  As it is now, you can get very good xp at zero risk by staying
a couple levels longer in areas that you have long since mastered.  I'm
seeing it on a daily basis, and when the folks I'm playing with decide

to do it too I'm experiencing it first hand.

True.  Lately I've had the luxury of being in 4 to 6 person groups
very nearly all the time I spend fighting.  I have to excuse myself
to go off and work on my Defense skill.

On a related note:  I am seeing an awful lot of tissue-paper casters
(including Clerics and Shaman!) in their 30s, a lot more than I ever
noticed previously.  My L38 Druid's slightly over 600 AC seems to be
roughly double that of every Cleric I've grouped with lately!  Does
nobody worry about being able to last long enough for a heal to land
or a mob to be taunted anymore?

I singled out Necros and Druids because so many of them have been
soloers in the past.

Actually, I've always felt that that (and its cousins: because they're
ninja looters, or foul mouthed, or just general assholes) was the only
good reason for turning away people from a group.  With the exception
of groups formed specificly by/for a guild or close friends of course.
