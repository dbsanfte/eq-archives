Your playing a melee heavy class, where the bulk of your ingame combat =
duties hinge on your melee skills.  Just say no to powerleveling. =20

Ok, powerlevel yourself thru the first 5 levels, but then I would slack =
off on the pling untill I had maxed out my wep skills...it sucks to have =
combats skills lacking at later levels, and it sucks even more trying to =
make up those skill points later in life...

Swing, miss, swing, miss, swing, miss, swing, miss, swing, You crush an =
Ulthork Warrior for 2 pts, swing, miss...etc, etc, etc...  That was me, =
trying to catch up my 2hb when I was a 38 druid.  I finally had to burn =
a ton of plat and all my unused training points to get it up to where I =
could hit with any consistency.

Just say no.
