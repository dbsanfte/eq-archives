You can still buy instant-cast-gate-to-bind-point gate potions from
vendors for about 1000pp.  I always prefered those, because I could
usually make 1000pp while XP camping faster than I could get a
cenobite to spawn with a potion.  Not to mention quite often someone
else was campign the potion when I went there.
