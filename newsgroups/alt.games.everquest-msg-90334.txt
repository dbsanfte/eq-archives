Heh, just wait though until the higher levels.

Most of the time (at least for me) it's not the corpse run itself that
annoys me but the major experience loss.

Especially at higher levels where it may have taken days or weeks to earn
that exp in the first place.

Enjoy your days of leveling multiple times a day, they come to an end all to
quickly.

Also, I agree that the effort and time to journey are worth it, however,
once you've seen West Karana 50 times on your way to Qeynos, it does get
quite old, this is why so many people shout for ports (or they're just too
stupid to realize it takes longer to get a port than to start hoofing it)
