Thanks. I tried to keep it as clean and fast as possible. It ain't
pretty, but it's neat and orderly at least. I've long since learned
that my web skills do not include any level of artistry, so I don't
even try. Now if only I could convince my boss - he actually read my
resume where is says I know HTML, and now is hinting that he wants me
to do the company site. Ack!

Hehe, thanks. Recent efforts have made me wonder if those good shots
were actually just flukes. I've ruined a lot of perfectly good film
lately.
