Its not that theyre "sprites", its that they have to be alpha blended. To
slap a normal poly on the screen, the video card just writes to screen
memory. For alpha blended polys, the video card needs to read the screen
memory, blend that with the new poly as specified by the programmer, and
then write it back to screen memory. With lots of bard sparklies, especially
close up, it might be equivalent to reading, blending, and writing the
entire screen 50 times - because each sparklie is blended with each other.
Video card manufacturers do what they can, but you can really get around it
without just making your memory and video processor blazingly fast. And as
you've noticed, even the Geforce 4's sometimes cant handle it. :)
