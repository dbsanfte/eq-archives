So, you're assuming that these dungeons will all be indoor dungeons?  ;)

Besides, I've never seen an enormous difference in the effectiveness
of a grouped Druid or Ranger based on whether they're indoors or out.
Sure, you lose the ability to fulfill certain roles (it's great fun
scouting/pulling with a wolfform Druid in Unrest, for instance), but you
are still easily able to be an effective contributor to a group.  Hell,
the most fun I've been having with my newest Druid is grouping indoors.
