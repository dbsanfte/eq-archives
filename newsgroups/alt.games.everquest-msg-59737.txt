    That's not how they used to work. It used to be that the highest green
that gave XP gave something like 1/2 or 1/4 normal XP, and the next lowest
green gave 1/2 that. You could see it when killing them solo - a blue would
give, say, a half blue, whereas a green barely moved the blue bar one pixel.
It looks like the penalty is still in place for killing a light blue - the
question is, how much?
