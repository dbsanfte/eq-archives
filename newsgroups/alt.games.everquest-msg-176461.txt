What does this have to do with Paganism? I've been reading this group for
some time now, and I have to say that it's not what it used to be. Time was
a decent pagan - or one with pagan views - could come in here and read,
perhaps post, and enjoy the banter. Now it seems to be full of half-witted
imbeciles like the poster of this nonsense.

Grow up.
