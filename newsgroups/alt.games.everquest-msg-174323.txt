"Warning to all:
Steve Leyland is a trolling twat of the highest order. Killfile the muppet now
and move on. Even the briefest of searches on his past UseNet posts will reveal
the truth. You have been warned.

"It's a bigger shame that packs of idiots can't keep their profanities
and idiocies in groups where such is the norm, but instead have to go
crying for attention in groups that don't deal in heavy cross posting,
cascades, profanity, abject stupidity, and every other moronic thing
that Steve Leyland, Dean Humphries, and Eddie Bernard represent."
