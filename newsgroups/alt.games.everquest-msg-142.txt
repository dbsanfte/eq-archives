~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's funny: recently I was thinking how nice it would be to have a
Reputation Index on EQ. Or it could be called 'Norrath faction', i.e.
your faction with Norrath has gone down. Each character (even on the
same account) has his own index. This is a practical way to deal with
bad people on blue servers.

You could either do it with physical beauty, or with numbers above the
head. Personally, I prefer the beauty, because it would be more
interesting, but practically, numbers make the most sense. Submissions
are anonymous, so you just gotta treat everyone with respect. And you
would have a real idea of who you want to group with, based on how
they look, or a reputation number over the head. Positive numbers mean
you are well-liked, negative numbers indicate how much you are
disliked. This is how it goes:

Everyone starts out regular looking, or with a base number of five. To
become better looking, or increase your reputation index, people must
submit a 111 for you. ( /submit <player name> 111 enter ) You gain
five points on the index.That means they like you, you are nice, good
group-mate, blah blah blah. And you can only submit once for another
player for every five of his levels. So, my friend Arti could submit a
111 on me when I am 30, 35, 40, 45, etc. 

However, you can become uglier to look at, or lose reputation points,
by people's 666 submissions. The difference with these is that the
same person can submit you once for everytime you level, and you only
lose one point per submission, but ultimately, over five levels, two
people can cancel each other's votes out.

It updates each time you zone, so you can always monitor how Norrath
views you. It's designed to help you get higher numbers easier, but
also offers the opportunity for people to know how the rest of Norrath
sees you, just upon meeting you. The bounty hunting / hangings are
cool, but twenty or so people do not represent enough of Norrath. This
would be a more enduring representation of the kind of person you are,
and gives you a constant opportunity to get along with people, be
respectful, and not screw people over. People don't have to be
frustrated because they can't do anything about the guy who screwed
them over. They can add to the measure that all of Norrath gets to
see, without impotent zone shouts.

After you are finished grouping, you could submit for each of your
party members. Assuming you group with new people at least some of the
time, and are a decent person, your RI should easily get pretty high.

----Been wishing God would make something like this IRL too, sort of
like a 'you are not nice to people, you become uglier; you treat
people with decency and respect, you get to be attractive.' That way
I'd know who I should date, and who will just ultimately give me
heartache. So far He has been ignoring me. =P

Yes, I know, I live in a fantasy world!
