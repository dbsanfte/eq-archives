Do you know the shift click and cntrl click shortcuts....BIG difference -
one grabs a stack and the other a single item from a stack.

The vendor is possible but its the 24/7 connect that is required, I have
quite happily gained vast quantities of cash trading in the bazaar but it
was the perma connect that did it, not the tradeskill wrists the spare
account (dont have one or a spae machine) - with alt-tabbing now enabled
you can minimise EQ and let it run, but that is as far to offline trading
as you can get so far...

If you dont have a 4/7 then in EQ you cant really be more than a
journeyman trader - if you have one then you can be a trader even if you
start small on a series of pelts and padding.
