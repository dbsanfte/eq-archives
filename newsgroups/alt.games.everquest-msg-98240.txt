LOL!

My cynicism became etched in stone the day they added the /book
command. I thought "what a cool feature!" then I jumped in the game
loaded up my spellcaster and tried out the command and... it didn't work.
Not only did it not work it fucked up the icons in the spellbook!
How fucking stupid do you have to be not to do something as simple
as to do a test to see if something works before you release it?
I would have fired someone over that.
