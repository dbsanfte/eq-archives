The only thing broken about rogues is that 12 year olds seem to have a
problem spelling the word. Verant should just nerf the name to Thief and be
done with it.

Which is why they cant tank.

And therefore shammys, druids and other buffers will be limited to one buff
each too.
Bards are the most difficult and involving class to play IMHO. This is why
they can solo and group very effectively. You work hard in the RL, your char
works hard in Norrath.

You said earlier that you arent taking the banner for any of the classes,
but I think its a fairly safe bet that you play one or all of the classes
that got nerfed.
If you have levelled some character just because of some level 55+ ability,
you are totally missing the point of the game.
