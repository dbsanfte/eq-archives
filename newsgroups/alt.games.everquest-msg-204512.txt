<snip long story>

All the guilds I've been in (except one, ill get to that in a sec) wouldnt
be impressed with someone who refused NTOV raids because they didnt want
faction hits with COV for roleplay reasons. The one guild that it would have
gone down OK was on FV server. Heck, we even had a guild rule not allowing
evil classes into guild (so that the guild hung itself on corpse summons).
Maybe you should start a char on FV server, if you can put up with the TLC
and the high % of kill/camp stealers there. (Just my observations)
