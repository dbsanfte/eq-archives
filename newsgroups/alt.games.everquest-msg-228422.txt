That doesn't give you any different abilities though, it only enhances 
those you're "stuck with". It would be nice to have the option of being 
able to obtain the mend skill, for example, as a caster. Naturally, game 
balance would need to be preserved somehow.

That's gonna happen in any case as long as there are different options. 
More options is still the best way to go, IMO.

Yet, in a classless system, you aren't gimped nearly as badly, because 
you can change direction where your skills and abilities are concerned.

That was one nice thing about SWG, the skill system. It was limited, 
however, to a specific number of "skill points" you had to spend on the 
various skill trees. You could give up a skill level at any time and get 
those points back if you changed your mind.
