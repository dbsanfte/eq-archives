 Although it's still a bit flaky as to how it's supposed to work. For
example, if you're in a large enough raid you can zone into Tactics all
by yourself. Halls of HonorB is the opposite. You can only zone in if
enough members of the raid are already in (and stay in) the zone. Which
is fun because if enough people die the unflagged people get the message
that they are being kicked out in 3 minutes.
