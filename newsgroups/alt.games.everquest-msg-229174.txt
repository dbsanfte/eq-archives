Guilty on more than one occasion. I don't spend too much time on server-
specific boards though, since I play on a few different servers.

However, there are some class boards though that I will never waste any 
time on again - not due to rants, but the overall smug asshole clique-ness 
of them (*cough*SK.org*cough*). You can spot them right away. They're the 
ones where it is a chore to obtain any useful information or participate at 
all without one of the crusty ones trying to smack you down in an effort to 
wax superficial and look superior.
