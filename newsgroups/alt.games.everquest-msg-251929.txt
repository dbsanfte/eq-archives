Do you rejoice in being a moron?

Do you understand the difference between a parallel
computing system with 100's of processors performing
teraflops and the component CPU's only performing 
in the gigaflops range?

Probably not - but since you rejoice in links, let
me give you one that's more than a mere media hack
blurb with no real substance -

http://www.cray.com/products/systems/x1/CrayX1ProductSheet_pdfonly.pdf

Note the second paragraph -

"The Cray X1 system, designed to be the world's most powerful supercomputer 
product, features ultra-fast (12.8 gigaflops) individual processors, up to 
819 gigaflops of peak computing power in a single chassis, and a high-
bandwidth, low-latency interconnect for substantially more efficient 
scaling than on clustered SMP systems.  The Cray X1 system is available 
with up to 52.4 teraflops of peak computing power."

Note that this document available from the makers of the systems says
exactly what you've been told already - the very thing you've been calling
someone else stupid for saying.

EACH INDIVIDUAL PROCESSOR DOES ~12 GIGAFLOPS - NOT TERAFLOPS

ONLY THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE PERFORMS IN THE TERAFLOPS RANGE. 

Read it, if any of the words are to long for you, come and ask for some
help.
