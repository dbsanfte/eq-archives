Go on a Plane of Hate raid, and upgrade to a more-or-less full suit of
ethereal mist armor. It won't take more than 2-3 raids (unlike any other
class, who are lucky to get a single piece in that timeframe...cleric drops
in PoH are beyond insane) to get a full suit, and that will solve most of
your problems.

Barring that, work on resist stuff (like diamond rings, blue diamond
bracer/earring, froglock crown), and AC stuff.
