>>Liv Tyler's Arwen is ferociously sexy, as is Galadriel (can't recall

I caught a comment from one of those 'behind the scenes' shows about
the making of LotR that I understand completely after seeing the
movie. Liv Tyler was making a comment about how all the guys nearby on
the set started blushing when she started doing her elvish lines.

No woman that looks that good should be allowed to speak elvish in a
closeup with soft backlighting.
