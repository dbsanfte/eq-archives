Well, I'd force it to copy pretty much all the .tga's from default. I
copied all the unchanged files over to my custom folder yesterday.
I've had a nice handful of crashes (especially from 'find trader', but
also once from trying to target a spiderling on a character that
hadn't had the broken target circling turned off yet) but no death
threats, even after looking at bazaar on 3 servers.
