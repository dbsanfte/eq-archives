Now now, be nice... those of us paying attention have noted in the
past that there are *many* things destroying EQ at the moment, not
just one. :-)

What you saw was the solution to a problem brought about by rampant
mudflation, one of the most major ones. To challenge a party now, mobs
must be much much stronger than they were, which makes them much less
forgiving of a failure, which means reducing the margin for error to
zero, which means making the things that negate it work 99% of the
time, reducing the amount of skill required to play.
