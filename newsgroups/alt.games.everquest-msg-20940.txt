You only need one DA, as a quick method for Detaunt. And you are right the
spell slot is too valuable. Anytime i saw the need for a second DA you were
pretty much in a wipeout anyway.

The above statements on healing are spot on. And you have to decide which
one to do when all under a fraction of a second.

I am thankfulk that they have made this spell line useful now. I always used
it in the olden days as a "cleric evac." When all is lost hit it and turn
the the evac'er and say "WE ARE LEAVING!"

Atoning is less needing in travel, now with the who Deaggro range thingy.
Wave of Fear is great for the whole cleric evac thing (see above).

Isn;t this the truth? everyone thinks clerics get a root line, it sticks for
about two seconds, until the para earth one (now that is a spell!). How many
times as a cleric do you hear, "root it! root it! root it!" and after the
deaths, why didn't you root it?"

"I rooted 7 times, it broke 4 times after 2 seconds, the other 32 were
resisted."

"Why didn't you heal me?

"Used all my mana trying to root!"

Words have their uses on Guild raids, and are HUGE to saving your lil party.
