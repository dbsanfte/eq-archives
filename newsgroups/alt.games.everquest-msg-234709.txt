Heh, as we found out... wiped four times on Inny last night before time ran
out.  Still have to perfect that strategy.

Yeah... our guildleader found that out.  =)

Yeah, I commented on this in my group, which had my guildleader in it.
Terrible DPS for a mob that hits for 3700.

Maybe it was fast cures, but I didn't have a shaman in my group.  Maybe
someone else was watching me and I didn't realize it.

Heh, really?  We've shown zero interest in the LDoN raids.  If we'd had
boring months of farming Time, maybe we would have done that.  For now,
though, we'll likely do GoD stuff before any LDoN raids.

Thanks.  =)  Now to bide my time for a BP mold...
