If that item is so so at best, then what uber belts are you getting for
your druid.  That was an item that was easy to get, risk reward blew
away anything else and is as good as anything pre-velious when the stat
drops got insane, but then so did the requirements to get said item.

Reed belt extremely extremely rare drop which is only thing even close
in stats, and the Girdle of the holy Wanderer has saves as well as the
same ac and wisdom.
My druid upgraded from a thick leather apron to that.  When I looted
that on my second kill, i about went into cardiac arrest from the shock
of how awesome that belt was.

I see stuff for under 1kpp all the time for druids, and druids aren't
the only ones who have to pay alot for equipment.  CGS can be bought for
under 400pp on most servers from what i have seen listed here, and it's
ac 10 9 wisdom, one less than the testament of vaneer.  Cloak of the ice
bear FWIW drops every time off Martar and Karg icebear.  They generally
spawn several times in a normal play period of a few hours.

at 28 if you don't already have them, you can try for braided ivy cords
from Thistle underbrush in lesser fay, or go to Cazic Thule and camp
with a group in the throne room, for a chance at a lizard scale mantle.  

You seem to want end game gear before you even are truely into mid
level.  Yes we all want good stats for our characters, but it's
unrealistic to assume you can get GEBS for a couple hundred pp, when the
camp is a PITA, and is basically a 40+ camp.  Guess What those GEBS you
crave are wanted by every Cleric, Shaman, Wizard, Mage, Necro, and
Enchanter out there also.
