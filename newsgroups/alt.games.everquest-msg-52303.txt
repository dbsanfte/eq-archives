Staffs tend to sell for vendors for a lot more cash than bladed weapons.  When
I said "two handers" I meant "rusty two handed swords" not staffs.  Depending
on the staff, you may be looking at enough money to buy two two handed
swords, and almost certainly the damage from the staff in question will be around
half that of that sword.

Look for halberds and rusty two handed swords in the hands of vendors, should
run about 5gp.  Sell all the little weapon loot and use the money to buy these
instead, and try to keep your pet alive as long as possible to get your money's
worth
