One more thing to add, just because it is trivial to make something does not
mean that you will have the 5% failure rate.  Your skill has to be well
above the trivial level for an item before your failure rate goes down to
the approximately 5% level.  For SoW potions, you will want your alchemy up
in the 70s or so in order to minimize failures.
