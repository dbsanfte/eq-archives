hi I'm a lvl 26 tailor.

i'd like to add that using geocraft instead of weaponcraft from 10 to 20 as
an outfitter wanting to bekome a tailor makes sense in an additional way.
once you choose to be a tailor, weaponcraft is no longer available anayway
and you have to use geocraft, there fore its better you got your skill up
before.

same for armorers using weaving skills instead of tailoring skills to make
pads harnasses etc.

i had some great problems cos i used skills i knew i woulndt have access to
anymore in T3 crafting.

regards
