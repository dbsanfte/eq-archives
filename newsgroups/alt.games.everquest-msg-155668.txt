Well, spell haste does work with pet spells, but it's 15% haste, whereas 
reanimation haste is 30%...

}Well, rats. Is it legal to enter under someone else's address?

Well, probably not.  But is that US law or Canadian law?  Where would they 
have to extradite who to for fraud?  Hmm...  I figure it'd just be 
claiming that your email address was actually my email address, and we 
have a prior arrangement that I'll sell you the monitor for the cost of 
shipping if I happen to win with that email address. :)

The rules say we're allowed to enter with up to 6 different email 
addresses, so what the heck. :)
