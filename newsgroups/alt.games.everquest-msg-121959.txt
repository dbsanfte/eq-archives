From Half Baked:

"Marijuana is a gateway drug. It leads to other things!"
"Yeah, like eatin'..."

Related note, Jimmy Kimbel when visiting Snoop Dogg's house for an
episode of The Man Show:
"Man, how do you smoke so much pot and stay so thin?"

Anyway...any drug who's most common affect is you sitting around not
motivated to do anything but giggle at everything like Bevis and
Butthead is definately...boring.
