As I'm sure you know, if a server split comes up you'll be able to take
all your stuff with you to the new green server.  However, all the hours
you have invested in your characters also resulted in a *lot* of items,
plat, etc. yes?  I suppose a higher level character could start making
money and gear faster than a raw newbie, but it would still be a huge PITA
to get back to where you were, wealthwise.
