Forget Ted. PETA scares the bejeezus out of me. I mean, it's a good
concept - ethical treatment of animals. But PETA carries it to an
insane extreme. ( Anyone remember their "Got Beer" campaign? )

It's not really about making the animal feel better. That point of
view is condemning those who hunt purely for sport. If you're not
going eat what you kill, don't kill it. It's an understanding of the
fact that life must destroy life to persist, and also that a balance
must be maintained. Which means, no unecissary destruction of life.

The point of view that I think is rather stupid are those who become
"vegans" for "humanitarian reasons". "I don't eat my friends!" is what
someone told me. I wasn't sure if I should laugh in their face or
smack some sense into them, so I settled for just walking off. Wonder
where these people would be if they discovered that plants have
feelings. ><
