Strange one of the reasons and it was only of many ;) That I gave up on 
DAoC was that I purchased the game from the states, it worked fine in 
the UK. However I had always believed that when it became available in 
the UK (with local servers possibly) that I would be able to play on 
those servers as well as the US one. Unfortunately in there infinite 
Wisdom they have given the marketting/distribution rights to local based 
companies who have no agreement with each other.

Therefore if you play on the UK servers (are they up yet?) you will have 
to get a UK version and pay the monthly fee. If you want the US one you 
have to buy the US one and pay the monthly fee. Part of the attraction 
of these games is the Worldwide appeal. I have nothing against playing 
with other UK players but the international flavour is also nice.

p.s whilst i'm here if you want to try a great turn based strategy game

No distributors, just the developers (Ex Xcom developers) and the 
players, well recommended
