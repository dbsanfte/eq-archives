It would seem that you lack a ability of differentiating  "tongue-in-cheek"
humor from blathering "like a fucking moron". The simple fact that you
resort to profanity is indicative of an immature intellect and a general
lack of cognative capabilities.

You are obviously offended by your own assumptions of what is implied.
"Stinkyfinger" simply denotes a finger that stinks. How YOU assume it got
that way is your own issue, not mine.

And your posts are not indicative of someone whos wisdom has been reinforced
by years of life's lessons.
