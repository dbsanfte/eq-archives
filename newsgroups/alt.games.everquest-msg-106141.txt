"I also wanted to address the rumors about changes to certain items on
Test.

No, we haven�t changed the Fungi Tunic on Test. However, it is possible
that we will do so in the future. We have been following the discussion
about this item across the fan sites and from emails sent in to us
directly. The Tunic is a pretty good example of the kind of item that
has a dramatic affect on the game when it is used by lower level
characters. We understand that some people see that as a good thing,
while others see it as a bad thing.

We haven�t made any decisions about applying the Recommended Level to
items like the tunic. But I wanted to let you know that such a change is
not impossible, for the tunic or other items with similar affect when
twinked.

****************
So there you have it. Rumor put to rest. [Well, except for Ben coming in
behind this and saying that Absor is lying/clueles. ;-) ]  However, you
may want to read that entire post. Some interesting information on the
"scalability" of items which is clearly being introduced to cut back on
twinking.
