Just to drop a note for those who haven't played a bard before, pressing 123
wouldn't work as you desired. What happens as a bard is that when you press
1, it stays "greyed out" and continues playing your song. So what you have
to do is press 1, wait for the song to finish "casting", and press any song
number (to stop the song from being repeated over and over). This ungreys
your songs, and then you can press 2 to sing the next song.
So a normal twist of three would go
1, pause, 2, 2, pause, 3, 3, pause, 1, 1, pause, etc.
I have heard of people using equipment to help them twist by creating
macros, you just have to take account the pauses and presing the buttons
twice.
Hope that helped,
Chaos
