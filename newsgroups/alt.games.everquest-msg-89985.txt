In most groups, everyone just stays and fights even though someone has
called RUN.  Even the caller sticks around.  I've been guilty of this
too, but I'm not usually the first to call it.  At least one death but
more regularly a TPW occurs because no one runs.  

Two sowed members died in a wide outdoor area 7 seconds to zone
because the puller brought back more than he expected.  Mob drops,
party member drops, another mob drops, another party member almost
dead.  I, the cleric, OOM.  Shaman is OOM.  I finally gated even
though I suppose the 4 remaining members could have finished off the
last 2 mobs.  I need some pointers :)

Thanks.
