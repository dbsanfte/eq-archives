I've noticed the gm's and guides seem basically absent now. PC caused so
many problems because of the extreme xp bonus and loot for it's level, and
the way the mobs were crowded together rathern than in separate 'camps' like
in EC and WC and NRo and so on. Luclin seems to have a lot of areas that a
single untwinked group couldn't take on without a chanter.. I used to avoid
it because of the aggro in that zone, and the high levels farming it for
money used to make me ill. At least with LDON you don't have that problem :)

I've only played on PoJ and PoD and not really in depth; do people still do
this stuff at the higher levels?
