I'm on his computer now, so I'm not sure what name this is going to be
posted as, but this is Annie.  Anyways, since the patch, Lenny cannot
play the game.  Whenever any character on any of our 3 accounts logs on,
he ends up crashing either within seconds or minutes of loading.  We
have basically the same machine, but mine is running fine.  We looked
for .txc (or was it .tcx?  whaterver, we looked for both) files to
delete, but he had none.  Got rid of all his .ini files, that did no
good either.  We seem to have different versions of the same drivers...
only difference is that his is called 7000 Radeon Family VE while mine
is the same save for the word "Family".

    I so, any ideas what we should try next?  Thanks in advance.
