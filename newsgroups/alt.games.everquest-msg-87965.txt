Nope, nope, and nope. Norton "runs" twice a week when I'm not here, plus
autoscanning new mail. Not while I'm playing. Plus, it's *been* in the
background while I play for ages. No problems. It was changing the
drivers that got the game "startable" again, though not really playable.

I'm going back now to try shutting EVERYTHING to do with Luclin off and
see if it approaches playable again. The older drivers that VI is now
insisting on will get you in, but I have no music (yes, the settings are
up for it) and the framerate could be counted on the fingers of Rainman
manually.

Tried both 16 and 32 for the bits per pixel setting. No difference.
Checked on three characters on two servers, all in different zones. A
formerly beautifully running EQ machine is now hosed and virtually
unplayable with these new drivers.
