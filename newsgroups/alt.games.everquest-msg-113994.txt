Hi all,

I'm a newbie to EQ--a wonderful game. I'm a lvl 16 barbie shaman. I've been
trying to find the spell Serpent Sight, but, no luck. My problem is that
I've learned the 2 Hand Blunt skill and have no free hand for a lantern.
Hence, no dungeons for me.

I really need this spell so I can play in the dungeons. It's not sold in my
home town Halas. I was pointed to Qeynos. No luck there. Can anyone offer
some advice on where to get this spell. Any help would be much appreciated.

Thank you.
