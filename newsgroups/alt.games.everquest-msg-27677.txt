Using put-downs and swear words doesn't improve your argument, make it well
received, nor makes you look smart or mature.  They do just the opposite.
And what it eventually does is get you a place in people's killfile.  Try to
be polite in your reply and respectful of others.  Your points will then be
considered and weighed without have the major blackmarks against them.  It's
all called tact.
