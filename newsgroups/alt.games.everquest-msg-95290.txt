   Don't feel bad about it, Biz.  About two weeks
ago I almost asked this group what their favorite
recipes were for office pot-lucks, before I realized
that I wasn't in rec.food.cooking.  I'm glad I
realized before I hit the "send" button, because
I really didn't want suggestions that I bring
Eatable goo or Smoked Wood Elf.
