"upper level" like the what...16th level enchanters who can cast quickness?
Or the 30th shamans with the same?

Haste spells have trouble stacking with one another...but please name for
me a haste spell that does not stack with an FBSS. Also, higher damage
output = more taunt.

The thick banded belt is mind numbing in its ability to distract people
with its 15 str from items that provide real benefit. You want the AC? Here
are items that are all better (even AC + other benefits more useful than
str, or just outright more ac):

Fine plate girdle (ac9)
Guardian Girdle (ac12, 10hp, 5cha, 8sta, 5MR) 
Mithril Plated Girth (9ac, 9str, 9sta)
Sarnak Hide Girdle (9ac, 4 agi/dex/wis)
Sentry Girdle (10ac, 10hp, 8agi, 5cha, 5MR)
Straw Spun Belt (10ac)
Thick leather apron (8ac)

That is only a very partial list of some of the easier to get items. All of
which I would get over a TBB, either because they are *far* superior, or
1/10th the cost. As a melee class, the FBSS beats them all, unless you have
your haste elsewhere. Theres no contest.
