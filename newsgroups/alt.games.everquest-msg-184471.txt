Hey hey hey - back the boat up :) How'd you do it?  I've heard varying 
reports on whether or not you can /duel someone and let their pet get 
your defense skills up - some say maybe, some say definitely not.  So a 
definite report from a rogue on how they did it would be nice :)

Personally, I think it's fun that they levelled up that fast, and I'd 
hope that anybody in a guild that's capable of even *doing* that would 
know better than to group until they're ready.  And probably doesn't 
need a group anyway ;p /point Meem
