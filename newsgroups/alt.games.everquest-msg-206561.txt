the reason why you might see ppl browsin your warez, but buyin notihng. can happen for a couple reasons. one thing that commonly happens , is if you are adjacent to other traders someone might accidently click on you when they were intending on clickin on someone else. another thing that commonly happens is when some1 camps for the night and logs on the next day , if they spawned on top of you or really close to you , and use the right mouse button to look around, they might have accidently clicked on you in the process. you can compare that to how sometimes ppl will accidently inspect you in a battle. finally , yes , sometimes ppl window shop, mainly to check and see if some1 accidently put the wrong price on an item , so always check your prices to insure a window shopper doesnt get something that was suppose to have an extra zero on the end of it , lol. well hope this helps ya out and gives ya an idea on why that happens. GL to ya . -DoC
