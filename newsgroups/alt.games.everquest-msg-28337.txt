Hmmm was running around Blackburrow getting gnoll fur patches (finally 
FINALLY had my skill high enough to finish the stupid quest without 
losing all the patches I'd collected so far - it was a tense moment when 
I hit that final 'combine' :) ) and I was hearing patches of conversation 
about a guild camping an area.  I went down to the lobby and I find about  
a dozen people sitting around discussing making a new guild.  They're 
telling people who aren't making the guild to go away, and when people 
need to run from overpulls, getting *mad* at them for pulling through 
there.  Hoo boy. :)  After yet another /shout of "stop training to the 
lobby!" I finally said /ooc no offense, but wouldn't it be easier to 
find, I dunno, a *safe* spot to meet, rather than making everyone go 
around you?  Didn't get any answer, but later found them at the QH 
entrance to BB still discussing 'how to make a guild'. :)

(I mean - creating a guild in a *dungeon*.  It wouldn't have been so bad 
if they weren't still so low level that some of them were getting 
*killed* from nearby gnolls...)
