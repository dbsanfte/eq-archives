I did the same thing when I got a Runed Circlet to replace my Savant's
Cap many moons ago.  Runed Circlet had like 3 more AC and 1 more Wis,
but look like such utter shit, that I gave the Circlet to a friend of
mine and dumped another 40pp on another Savants cap.

I'm sorry, but for me, looks DO matter.  :-)
