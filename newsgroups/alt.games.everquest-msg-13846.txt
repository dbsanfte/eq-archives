The only thing that comes to mind is that "grace period" when you zone in.

Some time ago, when you first enter a zone, all factions were default while
true factions loaded.  People complained b/c of Woushi killing his friends
before he knew they were his friend.  Recently they "fixed" this so that you
are non-KOS with everything for a brief time while your faction info loads.

So, when you zone your factions are still set at default, and you have a
"timer" of non-KOS status while true factions load.  Chances are you crashed
at this point, and it tried to save your data when you crashed, resulting in
default factions being saved.

At least, that's what it sounds like to me.
