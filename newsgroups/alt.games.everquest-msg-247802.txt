Hmm... a lot of non-US (and starting to be a lot of US) broadband providers
put their entire networks on NAT, which breaks a few things sometimes,
though EQ plays just fine through NAT. (AC, on the other hand, has some
'issues' with NAT.) If you are running through a router however, you may be
'double NAT'd' which can cause no end of random disconnects and problems.
Even if your provider is giving your 'main' router a real IP, If you have
two routers (say the one from your isp, plugged into a wireless router) you
may be 'double NAT'd' still.

I'm just speculating here.

as far as traffic. let's see, pings, don't know how big the packet is off
the top of my head, shouldn't be over 256 bytes with all the headers and
stuff (should in fact be significantly smaller).

One ping per second @ 64k would be... 0.9 Megabytes an hour, or 4.6
Megabytes or there about per day.
143 MB a month if it's on all the time.

Ping is however very configurable. See if you can set it down to once every
10 seconds, and see if that is good enough.

But you really want to get to the root of the problem. I don't know how good
your ISP's tech support is, but I'd try them. It's even possible they are
familiar with the problem. Example, one of the local cable companies is
familiar with the AC problem they have. Sorry it doesn't work anymore with
our new system and that won't change k thx bye. Which is why the ISP I work
for got 7 customers back from them in one week.
