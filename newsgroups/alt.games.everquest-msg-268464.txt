Well  I was tanking in a large group (5-6), basically I spent 2hrs simply 
standing still hitting shout etc, whilst everyone else ran and around and 
kicked some ass.

This wasnt quite what I was looking for when I started a 'fighter'. They 
should rename it 'stand still and taking a beating for the team' class ;-)

Still I do love playing EQ2, I love the various locations and the feel of 
taking part in a live environment.
