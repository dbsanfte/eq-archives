This is also factored when a mob cons green to someone of higher level.

So a L30 and L45 group and the L45 pulls all greens to him (red to the L30).

L45 exp is factored "out"so that the L30 will only get what he is due, and
not the extra xp the L45 wont get for the green con. Even if the L45
disbands before mob death, the xp is already earmarked for the L45 char.
