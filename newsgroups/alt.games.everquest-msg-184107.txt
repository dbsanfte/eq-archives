Well, I was out of EQ for almost two years and following SWG very closely 
during that time, but in the last 6 to 9 months they have made DRASTIC 
changes in the design of the game to accommodate a April release and a 
LOT of people have lost complete interest in that game. I lost so much 
interest that I no longer read the web site (used to visit it several 
times a day to keep up) and I started playing EQ again as a NEWBIE. 
That's how disillusioned I have become with their new "improved" design 
and "streamlined" product.
