Cool :) Recentley GM'd fletching myself, seems the bottom fell out of the
bow market on my server (ele bows for 20-25kish), but that wasnt why I did
it anyway.

Not seeing Acrylia Caverns again for a while will be nice, failed first GM
trophy, farming bits for a couple more attemps (artisans seal is abotu 7.5k
or so, but I'd rather get the bits myself).
