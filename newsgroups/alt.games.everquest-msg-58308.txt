I agree and disagree, necros get dots, fear, snare -like abilities, they
don't need tougher pets - leave the mages something. But allowing necro
spells to not be resist so much on high end raids would be great.
I really hate it when they boost up a class with other classes abilities.

While I am on the subject of things I think are wrong with EQ...I think they
screwed up making Epic items and expanding the levels past 50. It took alot
of the fun out of the game. For example Fear is a blast with groups that are
lvl 50 or below and a cakewalk with groups post 50. Anyone else share this
view.
