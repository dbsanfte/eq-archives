The graveyard area in the planes (well, at least the first tier ones,
haven't been any farther) are safe unless trained.

Disease - very few things see invis until deeper into the zone, and those
things are really unlikely to be trained to the zone in, occasionally there
might be a rat or fly or goo, but that's about it, anything else tends to
kill people faster than they can be trained, the "sliding door" nature of
the zone out also tends to make trains not work very well.

Nightmare.  Everything in the zone sees invis as far as I can tell (haven't
been past the big river yet though)  People tend to train semi-regularly.
This is the zone for 60+ kunark grinders (Oasis/LoIO/FM/OT/DL/KC), many
retards, and much whining.  Especially when my pet (charmed werewolf dude,
yes they're druid charmable) can singlehandedly KS a full group of 6 60+
people with no help from me beyond my 70% pet only haste.

Justice - Stuff in the first area from the zone in is non-agro, I didn't go
much farther in, but I didn't see any trains while I was there talking to
the prisoners.  This zone seems to be lower populated than the other first
tiers, probably because anyone in it is probably just doing the trial to get
access to Valor.

Innovation - Some things see invis, cramped quarters, trains are common.
Didn't spend much time here since there was nothing charmable.

Can't really offer much on your hunting situation, other than that an RL 60
mage friend did most of 50-56 in Cobalt Scar on wyverns, and that you will
NOT want to be hunting in the planes, as everything hits very hard and has a
fair lot of HP.
