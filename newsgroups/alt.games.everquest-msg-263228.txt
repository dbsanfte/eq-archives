    The commentators underneath shoot this fellow's idea full of holes. I 
think they got the "de facto currency" part wrong, because of the one-to-one 
trade restriction, but being able to control time of trade, specifics of 
what shall be received back, and ability to sell actual accounts on E-Bay 
means the game still has E-Bay selling as a viable possibility. If anything 
it's easier for the seller - obtain multiple accounts, trade them (both with 
one another and others) to desired states, sell the ones that reach 
"completed" states (accounts with all the assembled vehicles in them, for 
example). No work necessary obtaining items, just some scanning of the 
inventories of your accounts and a few quick trade posts.
