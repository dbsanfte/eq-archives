Time will tell what they will disable or not disable, but I seriously doubt
that this will in any way effect their competition, since the figures they
will be hiding will likely be available through many other trade and public
sources.  The only people who might want this information and not be able to
get it will be their customers.  In fact, the only real effect this will
have on anybody is to give VI a better cover when they blame server problems
and bugs on players isps and computers.  My bet is they intend to meet their
competition by cutting corners and lessening service and that this move will
give them a mask to hide behind.  As for the numbers their competitors are
concerned with I suspect the only ones that matter concern those of their
own player base assuming that this market has a limited number of people in
it and they are, in effect, involved in a zero sum game.  If on the other
hand the market is open ended and there is an unlimited number of potential
players available then the number of people playing EQ does not matter.
Either way VI has little justification for this move other than keeping it
players in the dark regarding the quality of its service.
