Win98 has issues with mem sizes over 512mb (not sure about ME),
although I understand there are work arounds to fix this problem. Even
with the workaround, Im not sure that its optimal.

To answer the original question, someone suggested upgrading both if
possible. The 16mb video card is probably the biggest bottleneck
there. If you upgrade the mem to 512mb, and turn on all the models,
with your video card, you'll probably have horrid video lag in most
(if not all) zones. Low end GeForce cards arent that expensive, nor
should a stick of 256mb of ram. If you can only afford one, then go
with upgrading the video card (16mb of video ram isnt that much these
days). Is the current video card built on to the motherboard and do
you have an AGP slot?
