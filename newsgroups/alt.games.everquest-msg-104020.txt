> Raids

Rogues, Wizards, Rogues, Wizards, Rogues, Wizards, you get the point.

If anything there are to many tanks at the higher levels 51+  You only
need 1 tank per group and only 2-3 for raids.  Any more than this
number and you are giving up damage.  Warriors do not come close to
dealing the damage a rogue/wizard or even a monk does and since you
should be keeping aggro on MA and SA all that AC/HPS excess tanks have
are not used.  On the other hand pure damage stacks nicely.
