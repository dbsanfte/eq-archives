"Zoning is designed to clear... aggro".  "It isn't difficult to code things
such that aggro is NOT cleared by zoning... think of the Rampage list".

As it turns out, zoning is designed *merely* to move between zones.  Your
own argument bolsters that nearly as much as you were trying to negate it.

"Incorrect" "there exist hate lists that are not cleared by zoning"
"[therefore zoning must exist solely to clear hate lists]".

Your entire logic behind your argument is faulty.  It would have been better
had you never mentioned rampage at all, because I would never have brought
up a situation where you can zone without clearing a mob's aggro.  :P

Sorry dude, we're talking about a recent patch.  Go back to your time
machine and punch in 1/1/1999 please.

And it can be done by anyone with root, snare, mez or simply a fast enough
computer.  Way more trouble than it's worth, and at least as bad as zoning
for a heal for any sort of "exploit" determination.
