Even if im grouped with a porter and get dropped off in DL, I still have a
10+ minute run to FV, then a 30 minute run back to Sebilis.

I don't know if you were of the level to know this, but at one time Kunark
evacs could only be cast inside dungeons.    That meant if you wanted to
port to EJ or SF, you had to do it from a place like karnors.

When starting out from FV, back tracking to KC to then hope for a port
wasn't really a valid option, im not the begging type, and I didn't like
paying for stuff that wasn't really a necessity.

So I just got used to the FV-Seb run, and even after the evac un-nerf, I
still ran 99% of the time.

Whats so wrong with being self sufficient?

Yes, at 55.  You know, just becase 99% of EQ chars are twinked out their
asses nowadays, it doesn't mean we all leveled that way.  Yes my gear was
dire, yes my bank balance was dire, and you know what? I still gave people
money and loot I was holding, as it just weighed me down and they looked in
need, because I felt sorry for people.

I still did my uttermost to gear my girlfriend (who started EQ after I did,
when my mage was lvl 20-30) and there was a time when 99% of what she wore
was because of me.  Sure I had to sacrifice my own gear, my mage was still
wearing over 50% cloth at level 53.  My monk had simply attrocious gear all
the way to 60

I had to learn pulls without SoW, without run speed 3, without Jboots, and
you know what really makes me laugh:  when a friend plays their alt monk in
my group and I let them pull, and after a while they state "god i need run
speed 3, i cant do this!"

Lazy monk = no skilled monk
Lazy anything = lacking in skills

Sometimes I had money to buy SoW potions, I had several druid friends, and
even as my puny ass mage I made the run from FV to ill omen without ever
dieing to the spiders

And if im going to bank, then im obviously not grouped with a SoWer.  Im not
the person that sits and begs for a buff, and add to that Sebilis is a
dungeon where you can't SoW.   The zoneout is in a different spot to the
zonein, so it's not often you even see people outside.

Of course SoW is better, im not an idiot.  But I learnt to live without it
if I had to.

Well not really, excluding guild Trakanon killings, I've been to Sebilis to
exp *twice* since the day I hit 60

Lol, you talk about getting a REAL group, and then mention zones where
ANYTHING is a real group.  Velk - you don't need a cleric here, you don't
even need a chanter.  If I can pull 7 spiders in 1 go (and kill them, which
I can do with ease), running just my monk and cleric, then Im damn sure a
group can easily handle that many, plus more.

Skyfire - I duo'd SF with a necro (which I mentioned),, dunno how much more
optimal of a group I could have gotten in there. And sebilis exp blew SF
away.   HS - sure I loved the place, groups were just a rarity. Chardok..
this was WAY before the re-vamp remember. SG?  Is there a worse exp zone in
the game?  I did go to SG once or twice (not counting guild outings) but
that was because a friend asked me, for fun and to make a change.. it sure
wasn't for loot or exp.

99.99999% of my Seb groups WERE well balanced groups.  A cleric,
chanter/bard and tank were an absolute MINIMUM.   This was every group, day
in day out.

As I got higher and higher, I began to realise how a "perfect" group wasn't
always needed.. I could do a 2-3 person UZO or Necro, and the exp would be
just as good.  And now?  I could take my bots and probably solo ANY upper
level camp in the whole dan zone

Well generally, yes.  But in all my experience, I have noticed by a clear
clear mile, that my most optimal kill rate in Velks is just me and my
cleric.  Not another cleric, not a tank, not another damage dealer, no
nothing, just me.

I can easily keep myself healed (and the cleric non-agrod, and always 90m+)
but add a few extra people into the equation and it means I have to start
tossing divine lights and remedy's around, if they take agro on some then im
not taking as much damage.. and cheal becomes less efficient.

If I pull several spiders at once, I melee each one to 80% or so (or as soon
as ensnare procs) on the pull, then find another and another etc, then take
them all back to my spot, MoR them all with the cleric, that combine with my
Coldain ring DS means they are already half dead by the time I get to fight
them.

I didn't have the gear to solo, the desire to move to a solo spot, nor the
desire to be alone.

Like I said at the top, even if I got a ride to DL, I still had the run
back.  Tl's to bind weren't available in these days either.

Yeah, I don't dispute that.  But for me it was always about getting exp out
of the way, so I could go have fun and explore, so I could raid without
bitching about lost exp.

In those days I was far too worked up about death/losing exp.. about missing
exp time because I had to do xxxx.. nowadays I can log in and not exp for
hours.. sit and chat to friends.. die 20 times deliberatly.. and I don't
care

Well I havent whined, nor did I at the time.  I always gave cash and items
to people, throughout my characters lives.  I earnt every single item I
have, I put my ass into pure exping, then pure raiding, then pure AA
exping/raiding/leveling bots.

Sure I could have had a more varied time leveling to 60.. I did epics and
plane raids very often, and chardok royals, I did go to different zones for
exp... I just didn't do crazy shit like 10 hour runs to Perma/Qeynos until I
had the time and desire.

One thing I regret was missing naggy/vox raids (which i have somewhat
rectified now)

I watched others take time off from exping to do quests, trade skills, farm
loot etc.. sure they had nicer gear than me, but I could pull just as good
as them, if not better.. and I did my pulls with uber ghetto gear, with half
the HP, AC and resists that they did.

I learnt the hard way, and now?  Im a main puller for my guild, one of the
biggest on my server. I was maybe the second sensei (final AA title) on my
server, I get a lot of compliments on my pulls.  I don't think my leveling
pattern held me back, infact if anything it made me a better monk.  I could
do the pulls with 2k HP, when other monks did similar with 3k+ hp.. so now I
have equal or better HP, well I still remember those old days of having to
make do with a whole lot less.

I've geared 2 clerics in velious armour (including BP and legs) , their
twinks and my twinks in quest gear/SS gear - all that I personally killed
and looted, and after just spending 80k+ on a cloak, ive got 130k left in
the bank... <3 the bazaar

I've also seen almost every zone in EQ, all this since hitting level 60.. so
sure I chose a different route to you, but I don't think you have any merit
to stand there and say your method is the right way, or even a better way
than mine.

it's just.... different

actually add to the regrets - wearing crescent slippers at level 60.. boy
was that an embarrasing regret!
