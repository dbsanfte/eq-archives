  Okay, so I'm getting bored with all the old models (I've even got Vah 
Shir and elemental low-res models turned on, and I've got mounts turned 
off completely), so I'm thinking about enabling at least some of the new 
models. Given the info on my system below, can anyone tell me how bad an 
idea this might be, if at all? Thanks.

Duron 1.2 GHz processor
512 Mb DDR RAM
GeForce4 MX 440 with 64 Mb of RAM and 4.0.7.2 NVIDIA drivers
Windows XP Pro SP1
