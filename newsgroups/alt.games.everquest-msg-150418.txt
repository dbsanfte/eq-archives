A while back FoH posted on their site that they were actively working with
Verant to upgrade class names. One of the ones the springs to mind was that
after Master Enchanters were going to be Deceiver. Same for other classes,
instead of all being called Sage we would have class specific names. Maybe
they will implement this as you achieve lvl 65.
