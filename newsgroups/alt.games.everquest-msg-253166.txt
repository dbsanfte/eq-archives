Had an interesting one with that a while back, actually.  I and a couple 
of very close guildie friends (4 characters, 3 people) decided a Sol Ro 
group would be fun, for an hour or so.  So we get there, and form up, and 
some random shammy zones in, begging for a group.  We decide to be softies 
and invite him, even though we have a perfectly good slower (me), and it 
can't hurt anything, right?

So we only have about an hour before two of us are going to have to leave, 
and sure enough, on the next-to-last mob, ornate silk glove pattern drops.  
Naturally, it being a mostly-guild group, my friends grats me, since I'm 
the only cloth caster.  Now, never mind that it's heavily debateable 
whether it's an upgrade, since I'm wearing Gauntlets of the Burning 
Prince, but have no MP item at all, but don't really nuke that much.  But 
then the shammy wants to roll on them...  Which seems kinda cheesy, since 
it's -obviously- not an upgrade for him.  The druid says "Oh, I was 
thinking NBG", and he says "what's that", and then advances the argument 
that he 'needs' it to sell to buy something he can use...  Anyway, I don't 
want to argue about it, I wanna go to bed instead, so I call a roll and 
roll, and he rolls higher, and then the druid rolls higher still and says 
"grats zin" again.

But I guess the point is, we sorta had our own loot system set up, and he 
was the outsider.  Admittedly, we didn't sit down and explain everything 
to him about our loot system before anything dropped, because to us, it 
seems obvious...  When cheesy Sol Ro ornate drops, it goes to the classes 
that can use, regardless of whether it's an upgrade or not.  It's just the 
way we do it.  But I guess it only takes being nice to one random stranger 
who probably otherwise woulda been LFG quite a while, before you gotta sit 
down and explain all the rules.  Sigh.

Of course, our system had 3-4 rolls to his one, so odds were in my favor 
anyway, heh.  Now, do I twink with those gloves, or sell them?  Hmm... 
Nice to finally win something valuable I don't actually need. :)

Ok, maybe it wasn't all that interesting. :)
