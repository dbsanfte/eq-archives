Gems tend to sell for very close to what you buy them for, they are an
excellent way to transfer money.  Avoid the quest gems, stick with the
basics, the one I'd reccomend just for the ease of it would be peridot.
Check the price, with good charisma and faction you should pay 10pp 5gp
each, and get almost that back.

If either character is having trouble hitting this mark, get opal encrusted
steins for a very cheap and easy way to get charisma up, and if that doesn't
do the trick (assuming this makes your charisma 105+) go find a vendor who
is friendlier faction with you.

Almost any gem works for this, in fact I've often used the fact of the small
difference between high and low on gems to turn small change into a stack of
mostly pp; buy whatever gem they have, sell it back, repeat as needed.  Each
time I lose a few silver, but less than I would on my other solution, which
is to just destroy gold silver and copper entirely.

I've certainly used this to transfer cash to alts, and always make a point
of leaving a few peridot on them just in case I need a favor from a cleric.
