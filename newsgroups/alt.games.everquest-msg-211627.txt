I play a level 40 ranger and am curious which of the two following weapons
is the most effective to use with my Defiance (9/19, 10ac, 6str 9dex):

        1.  Lupine Dagger (9/18, procs wolf form at 45ish)
        2.  Jagged Blade (13/25, 3ac, 10dex, 10mr).

I expect the jagged blade is best, since I am not high enough level to
benefit from lupine dagger's proc.  But, I will appreciate your opinions.  I
am also curious which hand combination is most effective.  I am currently
using the Jagged Blade as primary and Defaince in off-hand.  Is this best?
