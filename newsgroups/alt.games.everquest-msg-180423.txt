Same as -martin, 280 dex with focus, before avatar.

Yes, I accept that proc rate is affected by dexterity, but I believe each
weapon has an innate proc rate.

So, if 280 dex means it will proc twice as much as 100 dex, and the weapon's
proc rate is 1% of swings at normal dex (100)... you have a 2% chance.
If thats the average weapon, then primal seems to be set at a base rate of
3% or so, modified by dex to 6%.
