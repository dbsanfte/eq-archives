Tried logging on last night. Patcher detected updates, tried to download,
starting with a "greatdivide.txt" file. But nothing came through. Operation
timed out, claimed I/O error.
  Anyone else have this problem? Did someone at SOE screw up and try
uploading parts of tomorrow's patch too early?
  The error message also mentioned something about access priveleges.
Is there anything I have to change in my system to get it to download? I've 
sent
off an email to SOE, but also want your thoughts.
