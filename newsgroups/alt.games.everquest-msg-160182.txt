Any marketing peeps here? My guess is driving people out of a cash cow
business venture in the hope of catching them in another venture that
<hasn't been released yet> would be considered moronic.

Maybe everyone is just absolutely and completly fugged out out after another
disaster ridden expansion release and even the thought of even breathing on
anyhting resembling code brought them out in a shivering cold sweat?
