I couldn't agree with you more. This past week I took 3 of my mid level
alts to SRo to get J-Boots. On 3 separate occasions, after I had done a
lot of work killing everything on the sand, the AC spawned and I started
in on it. Each time a 65 who had been in the zone mere minutes, ran over
and KS'd it. I realize that it is a seriously contested mob, but
really...... My alts get xp from it (dark blue) and I did engage it
first on all occasions. It's almost as if "something" happens to some
people once they surpass level 60. Some become super nice, some well,
I'll leave the expletive to your imagination!
