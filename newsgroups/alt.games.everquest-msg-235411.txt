Only if its an obvious reference to somebody...

A Troll named Bernie? I dunno about you but  I'm drawing a blank... 

As far as misspellings of kermit etc, they're all illegal.

Most names are illegal if they are 'recognizable' or 'obvious' and ok
if not.

A Froglok named Kermit or "kerhmit"..  is pretty obvious.
So is Legolas, Leggolas, and his friends Leggollass and Llegolasss are
also illegal.

Isildulgoth or Moreanor constructed from the appendices of lotr or bit
characters mentioned in the Silmarillian are ok.
