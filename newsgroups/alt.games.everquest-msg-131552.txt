"Sending them a direct tell makes the option of ignoring the request paint
them as the rude one".
<end quote>
I call it politically correct thinking to say that a person is rude (or is
seen as rude) if they turn down a request, since the implication is that I
owe them something which I do not.  Any time someone asks me for something I
have the choice and the right to choose whether to give or not give.  To
"paint" me as rude if I choose to not give is an attempt to coerce me.  It
is very much a politically correct ploy.
