Once you've used the CD keys included with the game to register an account, 
they are forever associated with that account and can't be used to start a 
new one. So once you've activated an account (even if you activated it and 
got tired of it that same day), the CDs are useless to anyone who doesn't 
already have an account. To already have an account they must already have 
the CDs. They might be of some limited use to someone who used to play EQ, 
lost their original CDs, and wants to reinstall the game and use their old 
login, but that's about it.

Yes, the buyer could use your login and password, and thus use the account 
you registered yourself, but your details are in Verant's database as the 
account owner, not theirs. Transferring accounts is against the terms of 
the license, and VI treat such cases as if the account is stolen. The 
original owner can always get back access to the account with some phone 
calls/emails to VI, so people are a bit wary of buying accounts from other 
people. Also, they would never be able to arrange things like server 
transfers, since VI would look at the registration details and assume the 
account had been eBayed. If your buyer is stupid enough to buy a suspect 
account, they may as well go buy one on eBay full of high level characters, 
rather than buy your CDs just to save them a couple of bucks of the 
purchase price.
