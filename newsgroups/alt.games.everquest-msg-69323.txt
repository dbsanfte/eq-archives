Actually, one of these days I'll probably put all nukes on the first page
(after all, I doubt if I use more than 2 of each kind ever), AEs on the 2nd
(3/4) and my buffs on the 3rd (5/6).  On my other casters my main buffs are
on 5/6 and standardization is a really good idea when you have well over 10
characters on 2 accounts on the same server. :)
