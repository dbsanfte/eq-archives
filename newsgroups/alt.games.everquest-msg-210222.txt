For xp grouping, I'll take an SK or Paladin over a warrior all else being 
equal.  For some raid targets, the Defensive discipline is a must, and 
then you want a warrior.  A well equipped warrior will work almost as 
well as a knight class for xp grouping, just needs the right items for 
getting agro fast and holding it.

This is all from the perspective of a slower who gets agro off a warrior 
far more often and easilly than off of most knight classes.

All that being said, I don't generally pick and choose when grouping, if 
we need a tank, I take whatever one is handy that is of the appropriate 
level, and just adjust my casting to suit the group.
