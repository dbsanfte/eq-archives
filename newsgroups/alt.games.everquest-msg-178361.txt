Febuary 2 2002

     Well Tonight I Ventured With my Dark Elf From Neriak To  the
Mountains of  Rathe.  Well Needless to say I was brutally killed while
there. and now I am In the Desert Of Ro and my body is in the
Mountains. I know where the body is. What is the best way to go about
getting my body. I don't have pop so I have to walk,  Any Suggestions
would be appreciated. thanks in Adavance.  By the way I am Level 12 if
that helps anything.


thanks in Advance Nightwind
