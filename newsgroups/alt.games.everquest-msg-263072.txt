My untwinked Warrior on Morden Rasp had spent over 1kpp on gear by
the time he hit L20, maybe even 2kpp.  In fact, his income dropped
hugely after about L17 when there wasn't any more XP to speak of in
EC/WC, which are full of easy tradeskill drops, so he moved to OT
and LDoN to continue progressing in levels.

So yes, that's a real issue you raise.  But, and it's really a very
big "but", this is actually a tremendous improvement over "the old
days".  Because it just plain sucked trying to work your way up as
a Warrior unless you had a solid crew of friends always available
to play whenever you were on.  Sure, sometimes the pickup-group gods
would smile upon you, but often they would not.  And without the
gear available nowadays soloing a Warrior even in your teens was the
pits back then unless you were a very substantial twink.  Rogues
had it worse, knights were not a whole lot better off solo and had
an even worse time finding groups.

So, while you're busy lamenting mudflation, tradeskill component
farming, and powerful tradeable lowbie gear, don't forget that by
far the single biggest impact they have had is to largely level the
playing field for most casual melees vs. their caster/bard brothers
and sisters.  This benefit is larger and more important than the
admitedly real losses you're unhappy about.  Don't be so damned
eager to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
