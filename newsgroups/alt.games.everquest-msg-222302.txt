I am fairly new to the game, and ever since I got to 50s I have heard a lot
the acronym MQ, evidently pertaining tranfering nodrop items gotten by
higher levels to a lower levels? I asked people around but noone seem to be
able to explain to me. (got more of a newbe type of insults then answers)
If anyone would bother to explain me what MQ means and how is it done, I
would greatly appreciate it. Thank you

Nick
