You said you were on Prexus, right? I've been playing there since the
server opened, and the *only* time I ever say HQ bear prices break
into that range was once when some other budding tailor and I were
having a bidding war.

Aside from that one brief occasion, the price ceiling that I've seen
has always been 30 plat, with 20 to 25 being far more common lately.
