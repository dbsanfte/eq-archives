Hi All;

New comp will be here Friday (yaaahh).  I will be adding the hard drive in 
my current comp to the new one to transfer all my crap over to the new hard 
drive.

My question:  Will I be able to simply file copy the EQ2 directories over to 
the new hard drive, OR, must I go thru the whole install / patch routine 
again?

Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions.
