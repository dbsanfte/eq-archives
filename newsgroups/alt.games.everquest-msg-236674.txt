I find the trackball better, period.  The most imporant feature to me is 
that with a trackball, when I click on one of the buttons, the pointer 
doesn't move.  But then I have shaky, caffiene junky hands.  I also like 
that with a trackball, I can uniformly move the ball a certain amount, and 
the pointer will move that same amount.  With a mouse, if I move a certain 
amount, the pointer will move that far -unless- I bump into the edge of 
the mousing surface, or the ball gets snagged in the mouse and doesn't 
turn properly.  Basically, I think mice suck and should all be beat with 
hammers.  And Microsoft optical mice should be beat doubly hard for 
claiming to be an original idea, when Sun (among others) was making mice 
like that over a decade ago.
