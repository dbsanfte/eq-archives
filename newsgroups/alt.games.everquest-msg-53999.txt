You can get blue diamonds in many 50+ hunting zones.  I know they drop
in Seb and Plane of Air.  They are not that uncommon anymore, but you
may be better off just getting a lot of plat and finding a jeweler to
make them for you.  I know that our guild jewelers have started
selling resist gear for guild coffers now that entire guild is decked
out.  You probably want to diamond or blue diamond rings, bracers, and
earrings.  Also, <metal> diamond masks are very nice, gold buffs FR/CR
a lot and PR/DR a little, jasper (I think) does the opposite.  
With rings, bracers, earrings, face, and headgear I can get all of my
resists over 100 unbuffed, which puts me generally around 300 with
full buffs and bard song.
