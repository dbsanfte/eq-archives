I keep my display to the default and only occassionaly change display, i.e
to look around me.

So that is not the cause of the problem, and when i do flick through using
F10 it is instant.

I am going to try to update the Graphics with the Nvidia XP Drivers but
people have had problems with choppyness doing this.

Can only think that EQ Tech Team have made a boo-boo with their patches
because when i go into chat when disconnected numerous people are
complaining about the same thing.
