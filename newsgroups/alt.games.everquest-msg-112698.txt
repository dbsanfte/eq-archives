Couple possible ways.  Having a magician's help to CoH you up the drop, or a
wizard to nuke you up it, would help a lot.  Considering I'm gonna have
aggro of Nortlav and be *way* out in front of him (and probably a hundred
other mobs) I'd prefer the wizard cause then I don't have to wait til
Nortlav is close enough to re-aggro after the CoH.
