For me, it was not only necessary that I not be meleeing, but also that I
didn't have to change targets while doing this. My hotkey bar (the old 2x5
layout) had primary+secondary slots in it, and had my Backpack O' Musical
Instruments open next to it. Start playing string song, click on lute in
backpack, swap it in before the song finishes casting (all that matters),
stop singing, start playing percussion song, click on drum in backpack,
swap it in before the song finishes casting, stop singing, start playing
brass song, click on horn in backpack, swap it in before on drum on the
cursor, stop singing, start playing string song again, repeat until hands
fall off or brain stops functioning, whichever comes first :)

If you find twisting difficult or brain frying, twisting instruments at
the same time will probably give you seizures. But it's definitely
doable and worth it if you can pull it off.

Haven't played the bard since /melody or bandolier was added. My bando
doesn't have enough slots for all my instruments and weapons choices, but
I haven't played with it that much. I'm still (philosophically) out on
/melody. Seems like it would be great if you only played a small set of
songs or wanted to twist while afk, but one of the huge advantages of the
bard is to be flexible at 3 second intervals, and /melody doesn't really
lend itself well for that. They have automatic pilots that can do the
grunt work of flying an airplane, but if human pilots don't do the grunt
work themselves, they don't keep the bleeding edge reactions and skills
needed during an emergency. Same thing for /melody, IMO. On the gripping
hand, if it let me play the bard for longer than two hours at a time... :P
