I appreciate all the tips.  For those who have played bards, what was
your song lineup?

I've been trying to be all things to all people but it's not working
out too well when it gets deep.

When I try to be general purpose I have a lineup that includes song of
travel, mana/health regen, mez, charm, aura.  But if things get ugly I
need to be able to kite some mobs but I don't have non-invis speed nor
do I have a AE loaded.  I realize this is common to all classes and as
a necro and cleric I've had to make choices about which spells to keep
up, but being new enough to the bard class I'd like to hear what
others keep loaded.

Thanks.

~F
