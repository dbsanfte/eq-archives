I will get to the elemental planes, but, it is going to be a while yet.  
The guild I am in is slowly working our way to that point, but, it will 
be a while yet.  We only raid 3 times a week on a fixed schedule, so, we 
have to get very lucky on having the appropriate targets up, and, we need 
to grow some more and equip some more prior to making the push.
