If you end up buying the chipped bone rod, MAKE SURE you have either nobody 
or yourself targetted.  

I died in Wakening Lands (mostly covered in forest, not unlike gfay) after 
sitting down by a tree to med and getting HT'd and the crap knocked out of 
me by the corrupted unicorn.  Snagged a chipped bone rod, conned the mist 
panther on the way to where I thought my corpse was, clicked the chipped 
bone rod and tried to track the corpse of the panther :/  With only 2 
charges left, I ended up not finding my corpse with it and had to run a 
pattern that took forever.

Losing your corpse sucks.  Losing your corpse and spending your hard earned 
money to not recover it sucks worse.
