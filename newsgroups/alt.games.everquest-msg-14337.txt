I was under the impression that this would not work for lower levels
(not sure where the restriction is removed). I've had my lower level
(sub-20) characters grouped with higher lev's before (for example my lvl
15 Dru and my Father-In-Law's 29 Dru) and when we're doing bandits in NK
neither of us get any xp.
