Whether or not you are complaining about it, you ought to make note
of this dipstick's name and avoid grouping with him/her in the future.
Players who behave like this are placing their immediate personal

them.

If that were true then the monk is a tin-plated jerk, pigging out
on lowbie loot with a twink in a group is even scummier than begging.
