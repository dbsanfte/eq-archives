You should understand that the *only* reason I even considered jumping in 
there was the fact that he was refusing to SoW without a donation first. 
I don't accept donations for SoW. That's due to my own beliefs. If 
someone else wants or needs to offer SoW for donations, I suppose that's 
fine too. After all, no one appointed me buff etiquette general. 

Requiring a donation for it is just a bit much though, imho.
