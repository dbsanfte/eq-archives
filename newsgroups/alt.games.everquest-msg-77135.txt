Ideally you should wait, at least until you get Feign Death. Either way the
easiest way to get to the Overthere is via the Field of Bones. Go NE of Cabilis
'til you zone into Warslik Woods. Follow the zone edge on your left until it
reaches a point then run to the coast. AVOID ALL BUILDINGS. Follow the coast
west to the edge of the zone then, hugging the edge, head south where, after
going around a "bump",  you'll cross over into the Overthere. Exit the valley
and head due north to the coast, avoid sarnaks as they are the only ones who you
are KOS to despite your con says, then follow the coast west until you come into
sight of the outpost. Look out to sea and wait for the boat which will furl it's
sails and wait awhile before heading into dock. Swim out and climb up on one of
the angled barrels. You should be safe on board the boat. When the boat arrives,
eventually, at Ogre Island just wait until it leaves then as it passes the rocky
coast jump off and swim to the beach where the rafts land. HTH. :)

PS. I strongly suggest visiting eqatlas.com/atlas.html
