Earlier in this thread he posted a link to a rant board.  In the thread 
there, he posted a reply from the top dog GM that said "We looked into 
it, changed your char's name back, and will deal with this person ASAP.  
He shouldn't have done this." (paraphrase mine).

In other words, did happen, corrected to his satisfaction, and the 
"noob" GM is being dealt with.

Unless it *IS* a hoax.  But then it would be a VERY well thought out and 
carried out hoax.
