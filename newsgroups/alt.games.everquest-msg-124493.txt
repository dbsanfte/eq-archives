The only thing to remember when using a hub is that you will need an IP 
address for each computer. Most cable ISPs charge extra for each additional 
IP address. Some of them don't check how many you are actually using 
carefully so you might not even realize this. Please note however that 
using more IP addresses than you are authorized to use is theft of service 
even if the system allows you to do so. Sucks, but there it is.
