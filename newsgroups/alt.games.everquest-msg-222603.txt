My understanding is he is a 24 hours spawn, when VS is not up.  So, about 
24 hours after VS dies, VSR spawns, then, 24 hours after VSR is killed, 
VSR spawns again.  I believe thet VS is a 72 hours spawn.  If VSR is up 
when it's time for VS to spawn, then VSR despawns, and VS spawns.  I am 
not certain about this info however.
