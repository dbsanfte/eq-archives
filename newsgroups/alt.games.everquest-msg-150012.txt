When I needed to switch to giant faction, I spent my time in GD
instead of icewell killing dwarves. It was a while ago, and I don't
remember if I was max KOS beforehand to giants (I think I was). It
didn't take more than a couple days slaughtering GD dwarves before I
could turn in kobold stuff to the guy in the bank.

Since then, I've gone from max KOS to dwarves, to kindly, in a matter
of hours killing giants in GD and greens in Kael. So I'm thinking that
if the positive hits for killing giants and dwarves are equal in GD,
then you shouldn't be too far off dubious.
