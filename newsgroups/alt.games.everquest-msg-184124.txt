I rather disagree. The donor probably thought that his stuff would serve 
better a real untwinked newbie, and more power to him. What was a bit 
rude is making him walk to the lift before refusing him. Whenever I'm in 
the mood to donate something, I *ask* not even whether the prospective 
recipient is a twink, but whether they have a main character. If they do, 
no deal.
