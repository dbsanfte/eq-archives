Its also only helping because of a current bug with Umbra. When the
bug is fixed umbra should make them FASTER. Also I have a card that
doesn't use umbra and notice no difference using that command, so what
it should say is "I have a card that uses umbra but seem to have bad
frame rate, how can i increase my frame rate?" 

There are about 50 or something things you could do to increase your
framerate.
