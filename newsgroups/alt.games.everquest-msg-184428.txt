    Well ill have a look, most things in DL are lblue to me and i was still
able to selectively pull a yellow and a bit per 2.5 hours so it might be a
goer. I just want 52 then I'll use my new uber farming powers to get some
more cash for the alt's smithing, and that's only 2.5 yellows away......
could do it in DL but..... DL has become tiresome.

zones.

    ohhhhh god anything but more HHK lol (20-34, and about 90% of my plat in
my late 30's early 40's still... tempting for the sheer humor value of
exping there yet again)

    And yeah, wont be buying LoY any time soon so there goes that *bound to
be excellent* adventure ;)
