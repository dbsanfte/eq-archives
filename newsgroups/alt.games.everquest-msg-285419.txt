I grouped with some people last night in Shadeweaver's Thicket in some
weird tunnel area I'd never been to.  The group had a mage but all the
mobs were fire elementals of sorts.  Once I got there and started
dropping Ice Comet and Voltaic Draught they said it was a huge
difference now that I was there.

Apparently the Mage DPS was nuetralized because the mobs were so fire
resistant.  Sooooo, while I am still unhappy that mages out-nuke me
for most of my life it's nice to see a real need come up now and then.
