I've found that for the most part, the people who are asses, get what was
coming in some way or another.

For example, the last couple weeks in Highkeep basement, there's some guy
who's been camping at least 1 of the rooms, sometimes 2, to PL his level 18
monk to level 30, well, I was down in the raider room as the leader of a
group, and who should come in?  that damn monk :  "Hi Friends, got room for
one more?"  all 5 of us said "no" instantly.  You step on peoples toes and
piss people off, don't expect them to be your buddy later on when you need
them.
