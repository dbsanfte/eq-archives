<snip> I read that and wondered if that was what it was, too - however 
this was at 2:30am and there was no 'yellow warning' or five, like usual.  
And I did eventually get back on (and I HAD died, so thank god) and 
someone was talking to a GM in chat and said it was router problems and I 
then asked ooc whether it was 3am or 3:30am that EM was coming down for 
maintenance and got a whole bunch of tells of yes/no/maybe so - turned 
out nobody really knew what the latest word was.  But I played right up 
until just after three and there wasn't a whisper of warning, so whatever 
it was, it didn't happen :)

Knowing my luck, they'll schedule it for my days off *mutters*
