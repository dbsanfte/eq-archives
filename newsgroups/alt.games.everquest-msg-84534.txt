Yeah, if you're fighting mobs that run, such as furbies (burynai) or
Iksar outlaws, it's a good idea to pull them up one of the ramps a
little way or even outside of the pit, so when they run, they will
just run up or down the ramp rather than into the wall.  

Also, if you do happen to get a mob that goes through the wall and
turns invisible, if you're a caster you can still nuke it to death.
Or if you're a melee, you could ask a kindly caster if they could
target you, then /assist you and nuke the mob to death for you (I've
done that before with my shaman).  Otherwise the only way to lose the
mob is to zone.
