You're going to need a better processor than a 450, most likely. I'm playing
with an AMD K6 3 450, and Luclin is just BARELY playable with clip plane
halfway in, no new models, detail turned down, etc. Using a GeForce 2 as
well.

How much RAM do you have? You'll need at least 384 to bother with it, and
more is better.
