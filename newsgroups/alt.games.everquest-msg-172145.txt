I noticed similar spells for Shaman on allakhazams...  my guess is that any
level one, if they *could* earn alternate abilities, could earn those spells
(I think the shaman's were listed as 'innate ablilities')

The only think I could figure - if they later decide to lower the threshhold
for earning AA points, they wouldn't need to reconfig the spells... The
spells will work for any level char, as long as they have appropriate AA
points...

if you do the search with 'ignore AA abilities' selected, they don't appear:
