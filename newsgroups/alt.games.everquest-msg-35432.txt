    Did you notice if the lizards assist, or if there's any faction hits on
the gators? When I first did CT I only ever did Lower Temple, once or twice
in Pyramid and once or twice in AoF, never Pools. I'd love to send my monk
over for some solo gator bashing if he can do it and still walk around
unmolested afterwards. I'll have to con a few other things too, like
prisoners and the apes in the Temple.
