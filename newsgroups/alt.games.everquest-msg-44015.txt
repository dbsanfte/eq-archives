Last night, a naked ranger was running around Dreadlands. He lived in
NYC, hadn't been able to log in for a week, and had suffered corpse
rot. After a while, he said 'goodbye, I'm not playing this character
any more' and a while later I saw his naked corpse lying in the middle
of nowhere - seems he staged his death before camping :/
