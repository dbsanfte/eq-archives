Nah, you need heads from 3 different named gnolls in SK for that quest, 
and Ghanex is the common one that always spawns in the same spot.  Anyone 
looking for the other two is sure to come across him at some point, so you 
really might as well just hand it to some monk.  You might be able to get 
20pp for it or so if you really wanted to press the point.
