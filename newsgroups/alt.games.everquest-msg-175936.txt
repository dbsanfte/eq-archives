They aren't soloing monsters like Druids or Necromancers, but they can 
certainly solo at their lower levels. Their soloability skyrockets when 
they get access to a Jaundice Bone Bracer, with its mana-free nuke.

Unfortunately, GMs don't seem to do anything about it *even* if you are 
disturbing people in the area, so if you are careful and respectful it 
really shouldn't be a problem.

I would say you ought to level up by yourself. You aren't going to learn 
to solo by being powerlevelled, and 90% of an effective soloer is 
experience and skill.
