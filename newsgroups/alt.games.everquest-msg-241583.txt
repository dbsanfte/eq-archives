Depends on what you like. My offhand suggestions, though, would be to
go onto Kazaa or some such and grab fansubs of Inu Yasha (the Cartoon
Network dubs are horrible. They even have one of the characters
sounding like Jar Jar Binks, for gods' sake!). Also check out Trigun
(Good mix of serious and silly) and Ghost in the Shell (Has a sort of
Blade Runner feel to it. Considered a classic by most).
