I don't own a horse, but if I did, I'd certainly still carry my TBoots.

Tboots can be clicked right before going in to a dungeon, to give you
at least a few minutes of increased movement in there, during the
most dangerous part, often, which is setup and breakin.

Tboot effect gives you mobility without the aggro of being treated
as sitting.

You can't be stunned or slammed off your Tboot effect.

Tboot effect is a debuffable icon, which means it, instead of
something more vital, gets dispelled... and you just click to
put it back.  JBoots the same, only zero delay, which means
you don't have to stop what you are doing to take care of
buff protection (If I had Jboots my Tboots would be in the bank)

WHy don't I have a horse?  Well, I've got TBoots, which for
the reasons above are better than a horse in many instances.
TBoots cost me about 6Kpp, plus I bought em before horses
were released.  I usually travel with a SOWer if I'm going
anywhere outdoors, and if I'm not, well, I can outrun mobs,
so the difference in speed between me and the fastest horse
just comes down to a little extra time crossing zones.

Why isn't faster worth more money?  Well, I used to be a
SOW drinker... and I saved up enough to but TBoots,
which slowed me down but weren't such a pain.  Tboots
is fast enough, faster just isn't worth the effort of keeping
a stock of potions handy.  If faster isn't worth the trouble,
is it worth the 15Kpp plus that it would require to buy
something faster but otherwise inferior?  Well, not to me.
