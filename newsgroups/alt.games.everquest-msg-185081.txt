    Necromancers get a spell at level 65 that allows them to charm the
undead in the Carprin area. Haste those bad boys up and they can put out up
to 575 DPS. For comparison, Sean the wonder ranger in FoH parses himself at
220 DPS or so using the best bows in the game, the planar tradeskill ones.
One pet is putting out the DPS of a solid group, but you don't need a solid
group to do this - just the necromancer, and the cleric with him leeching,
er aiding in the process! (They can get better XP without me, but I do allow
them to fight non-stop and clear more area so there is a compelling reason
to have me along.)

    Have you ever done the mini event down the left corridor, Overlord
Paffa? A rival guild used to do it as a formal raid. We've done it twice now
with two necromancers and two clerics. The boss dies in about a minute.

    Tactics can be pretty good if you get in the pit and have an enchanter
with a charmed war boar. Similar idea to what I do in CoD, except the ENC
usually doesn't haste the boar because of all the adds you get when pulling.
When charm breaks, I spend all my time controlling the pet. So if the ENC
were to have a mez resist as charm breaks, they'd be dead. As I found out
last time I was there.
