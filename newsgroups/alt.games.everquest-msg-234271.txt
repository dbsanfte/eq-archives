Here's what I know
Your first month is free dont need to pay for it afterwards

No credit card requirement at 30 day trial - I am sure I didnt and
that was about 6 months ago

Once this is up you need to enter card details - you then are charged
everymonth automaticly

You may cancel your account at any time

Characters and skill are not lost - I used my 30 day trial then after
a month or so decided to enter credit card details and low and behold
my characters were still there.

To access everything you need to purchase further expansions - dig
deep in your pockets

Reference gameplay, camps etc you decide how you play, different
servers contain different people you can try them all if you wish

maybe some of what I said is wrong but thats how I seem to remember it
good luck
