i was talking to someone who off handedly commented that the one bad thing
about playing iksars is that no one wants to group with them.
is this true?
are players judging a "good" group member by there looks?and "back story"
reputation?
and i discount any claims of it being from role playing.cus when's the last
time you saw anybody role-playing outside of the role-playing servers.
is it true of those filthy inkies.....i mean dark elves?
just curious
