On the Bombings
Noam Chomsky

The terrorist attacks were major atrocities. In scale they may not reach
the level of many others, for example, Clinton's bombing of the Sudan
with no credible pretext, destroying half its pharmaceutical supplies
and killing unknown numbers of people (no one knows, because the US
blocked an inquiry at the UN and no one cares to pursue it). Not to
speak of much worse cases, which easily come to mind. But that this was
a horrendous crime is not in doubt. The primary victims, as usual, were
working people: janitors, secretaries, firemen, etc. It is likely to
prove to be a crushing blow to Palestinians and other poor and oppressed
people. It is also likely to lead to harsh security controls, with many
possible ramifications for undermining civil liberties and internal
freedom.

The events reveal, dramatically, the foolishness of the project of
"missile defense." As has been obvious all along, and pointed out
repeatedly by strategic analysts, if anyone wants to cause immense
damage in the US, including weapons of mass destruction, they are highly
unlikely to launch a missile attack, thus guaranteeing their immediate
destruction. There are innumerable easier ways that are basically
unstoppable. But today's events will, very likely, be exploited to
increase the pressure to develop these systems and put them into place.
"Defense" is a thin cover for plans for militarization of space, and
with good PR, even the flimsiest arguments will carry some weight among
a frightened public.

In short, the crime is a gift to the hard jingoist right, those who hope
to use force to control their domains. That is even putting aside the
likely US actions, and what they will trigger -- possibly more attacks
like this one, or worse. The prospects ahead are even more ominous than
they appeared to be before the latest atrocities.

As to how to react, we have a choice. We can express justified horror;
we can seek to understand what may have led to the crimes, which means
making an effort to enter the minds of the likely perpetrators. If we
choose the latter course, we can do no better, I think, than to listen
to the words of Robert Fisk, whose direct knowledge and insight into
affairs of the region is unmatched after many years of distinguished
reporting. Describing "The wickedness and awesome cruelty of a crushed
and humiliated people," he writes that "this is not the war of democracy
versus terror that the world will be asked to believe in the coming
days. It is also about American missiles smashing into Palestinian homes
and US helicopters firing missiles into a Lebanese ambulance in 1996 and
American shells crashing into a village called Qana and about a Lebanese
militia - paid and uniformed by America's Israeli ally - hacking and
raping and murdering their way through refugee camps." And much more.
Again, we have a choice: we may try to understand, or refuse to do so,
contributing to the likelihood that much worse lies ahead.
