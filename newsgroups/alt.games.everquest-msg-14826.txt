44/60 2hs
Drops in Karnors but apart from that I know little more.

Saw someone offering a pretty nice trade (Felhammer and Ikky BP) for one the
other day.
I'm not so impressed with the stats (loads of damage but very, very slow.
Although a nice Haste item and Enchanter buff would bring this down,
considerably) so unless it was for novelty or a quest item I thought the
trade was a bit excessive.
Not heard anything about them no longer dropping.

Wonder what a 60th Warrior with 250str and a Crippling blow could do with
one of these
