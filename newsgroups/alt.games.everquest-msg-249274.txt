Except the playerbase itself has changed along with the game,
rendering the whole "experiment" pointless. You could turn EQ into a
fps, and maybe it doubles in size, and a poll of the players says its
the best it ever was... but that doesn't mean it should have been an
fps from the beginning.

 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
