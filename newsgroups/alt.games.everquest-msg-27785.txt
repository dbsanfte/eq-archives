The problem was no one was at Velk's or didn't want to give him
the /loc or was too busy to give it to him. But he just kept shouting
over and over and over.

In the time of all of his shouts I could have gone to a web site,
downloaded a map, printed it out in color, logged back in, made my
way to Velk's, been fighting, and this idiot would have still have been
shouting for the /loc.
