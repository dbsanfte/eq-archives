    As big as it is, it's still the same company, and it has the same finite
resources. Money spent on EQ2 could have been spent on EQ, and wasn't.

    Sure, but why are they ready to leave EQ? Many of them are just simply
over it - this happens.

    A lot, however, are sick of poor CS, poor quality of development (bugs,
no playtesting), and slow development (serious balance issues not addressed
for 12+ months). These people are going to leave EQ for a different game,
and are unlikely to return to yet another Sony game.

    Really, this is the crux of the issue. EQ2 is really a continuation of
the same product, and that could have been done without alienating their
entire existing customer base of that product.
