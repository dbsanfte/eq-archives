Learn some basic algebra.

X*(Y/Z+W) = X*Y/Z + X*W

If I wanted to divide INT by 5+2, I would have had to put parenthises around
the 5+2, or, I would have just put a 7 there.

You will find, that by applying basic algebra rules to the equation I put
forward that it is equivalent to the one you have put forward.  Facter out
Level from yours, and look at what you end up with.
