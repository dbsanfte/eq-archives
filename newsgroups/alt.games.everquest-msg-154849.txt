I am new to Everquest but I am definitey going to try Everquest 2 as I am
impressed by all of what I've read & seen. My question is about the new
Trademan class. I have read about it but I didn't understand if they meant
that the tradesman indeed could be a real Merchant or not. Anyone can
obviously sell or trade there things with anyone else so if this tradesman
can be a merchant there must be more to that, for instance, can this
merchant have his/her own shop to barter out of so that this way everyday
players will know they can go to that building to find John Doe the
tradesman merchant to make some trades instead of going to an NPC? Or does
the tradesman just use his/her skills to make & sell along the routes of
adventuring & we have to catch him walking around in order to do buisness?

I know in Asheron's Call 2 they have done away with the NPC's but I think
they should have atleast kept some in town.
