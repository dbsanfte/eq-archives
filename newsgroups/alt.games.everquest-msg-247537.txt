As someone who runs a brick and mortar store the 'credit card matters' 
part is nice. But I've got, several times a year, to prove to the credit 
card companies that some moron really DID use the card they're 
contesting the charges they made while drunk and don't remember or don't 
want to admit they spent that much on stuff. (Nominated for most 
annoying run-on sentence award) It's a pain in the butt to keep all 
those receipts where I can get at them. Yeah. We're supposed to keep 
them, but it doesn't mean I should be expected to have to FIND the 
specific receipt... what're they thinking? I'm going to be organized? lol

I hate pin-heads who challenge a charge they known darned well they 
made. I don't know how this would be done via online charges or how big 
of a problem it would be but the whole consumer protection thing, while 
nice, opens the doors for the more unscrupulous out there to attempt to 
get things for free and defraud the seller.

FWIW: I haven't lost yet, but they're not out anything for trying and 
I'm out time. I wish they'd double the charge on contested charges so 
that people wouldn't do it on a lark to try and get things for free. 
Half to me and half to the charging company. I want SOMETHING out of the 
deal. Everybody should win except the schmuck. hehehe
