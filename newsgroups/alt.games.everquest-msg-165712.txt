I agree mostly with everything you said (except it took me 8kb to say it
opposed to your 4) except the shard business.

I think VI fucked up on the ME camp.  I think they fucked up bad.

I think they just fucked up on ME period though.  The zone has 50% too many
wandering mobs (if not more).. and seems the place of choice for people who
graduate from Karnors.

(I did ME for 1 day when SoL came out, havent stayed in the zone more than 5
mins since, until shard farming..  god did i forget how bad the zone/people
are)
