  Like I said, I don't even think it was a dark elf.  It was probably one of the
Combine "inquisitors" who were dead set against bringing the likes of the dark
elves into the Combine Empire.  By poisoning the leader of the Empire (who was
in favor of letting the dark elves in) so he looked like he was insane and
possessed, they were furthering their own political goals.

  I could be wrong though, it might have been a dark elf.  In any event I don't
know the person's name or where you might find that information.
