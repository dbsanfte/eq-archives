Another technique is to snare and root the mob, then stand very close to it.
Rooted mobs pick their targets based on distance, rather than by hate list
order, and so the newbie can whack away at the mob, and it won't fight back,
as long as the Ranger is standing closer.  You can pick mobs that are red to
the newbie but green enough to the Ranger that they can't hit the Ranger,
and it works great, as long as the mobs aren't so red to the newbie that the
newbie can't reasonable kill them, or that when root breaks they will kill
the newbie in a couple of hits.  The newbie has to be able to survive long
enough to step away and let the Ranger reroot.
