I doubt they are using Linux for EQ1.  EQ1 came out early enough that 
Linux was probably not even considered.  Also, they are known to like 
Oracle for databases at SOE, and I am not sure Oracle was available for 
Linux when EQ1 came out.

Linux certainly can be used for MMORPGs.  DAoC is on Dell servers 
running a version of Red Hat customized by Mythic, and using MySQL for 
their database.  But DAoC came out a couple years after EQ1, when Linux 
had advanced quite a bit.
