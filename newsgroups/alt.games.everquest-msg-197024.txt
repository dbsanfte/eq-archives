Hey, my friends need money too, might as well have em do something for
it instead of just giving it to them.  Well you can get things done if
you bribe people, like say maybe the gambling rooms finished in Highkeep
or something.  A little nudge in the right place to improve the game in
the way you want.  I don't see anything wrong with either of those.

What's the fun of buying items in a game?  I just don't get it.  If I
did that, I'd probably be bored in a week and quit with quite a loss.
