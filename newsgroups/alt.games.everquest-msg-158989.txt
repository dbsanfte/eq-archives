AC buff is not really needed on the fly.  I don't use up
a slot for this on Paladin or my (baby) Cleric, mem it
when you need it.


> 3. Bravery


The HP/AC line makes for handy lo agro heals, not sure how
efficient Bravery is (Paladin does not get this one and my
Cleric is a baby), but all of those that I've used were more
mana efficient than the heals available at the same time.

Symbols cost a lot of mana for the benefit received.  And they're
not needed on the fly.  Mem and use symbol when/where appropriate
and use the slot for something more likely to be useful in a hurry.
Best use of symbols at your level, IMO, would be on an Enchanter
if you are grouped with one and depending on her for crowd control
(dead Enchanter often leads to dead group).  Your heals are smaller
than your melee's HP totals, so symbol doesn't have a whole lot of
effect.  (If you are fighting solo, OTOH, you might well want to
symbol yourself.)

You could have two more combat usable spells up, a nuke perhaps, and
one other that's situational to the mobs you are facing (or even
Invigor if you're grouped with low stamina melees, which can happen
sometimes at lower level, I know, I was one of them).
