At 12:01 a.m. April 1, there is a brief shimmering at the horizon across
Norrath, and then odd things start occuring....


-- trained mobs have a random chance of maintaining aggro and pursuit
through a zoneline that their target passes through.

-- summoning mobs, instead of attacking the summoned player, plant a
big wet kiss: there is a giant shmooching noise and a large red-lipstick
kiss graphic appears in the middle your screen for 6 ticks, during
which are unresistably charmed.

-- Greater Wolf Form turns the target into Wiley Coyote: you look like him,
your INT and WIS drop to 0, and you uncontrollably target and attack any
avian mob that comes into view.

-- bards...kiting...duration of Selo's...random number generator...and the
GMs are placing bets as they watch you zoom around Grimling with
15 mobs in tow.

-- a case study in the impact of sudden supply-chain changes on free
markets: chanters discover that KEI can again be cast on players/groups
regardless of level, but it now has a recast time of 1 hour.

-- beastlord warders start behaving in racially-appropriate ways: feline
warders become aloof and lie down to take naps at unpredictable intervals;
canine warders are prone to bolting off in chase of any rodent or feline mob
that comes into view; ursine warders are irresistably drawn to streams
where they start looking for fish; and the warders of iksar beastlords are
constantly eating Paige's sweaters.

-- any player who correctly /reports the fictional-character reference in
the previous item receives a stack of no-rent "vente caffe latte"
drinkables, which when consumed instantly replenish the endurance bar
while reducing DEX by 50 points (intense caffeine buzz gives you the
shakes).

-- chests and barrels in LDoN dungeons contain race-specific underwear
and lingerie, which has an additional "gender" flag. Female avatars can wear
items flagged "male", but the reverse is not true.

-- some NPC's who have been secret doubleagents decide to "come out
of the cold": they suddenly change their racial or faction alignments
whether or not a player is interacting with them at that moment.

-- the "nerf bat" becomes literal: a giant yellow plastic bat swings
down and smacks [fill in your favorite "overpowered" class] on
the head as the latest class adjustment is put into effect.
