Lots more than that actually . The red swirling mass spawns about every 3
hrs if you keep all 12 mobs constantly killed. The melee earring is rare as
all hell btw. Oh and yesterday we had 3 pairs of boots drop in 8 hrs. You
are vastly underestimating the rate they are entering. There are at least 30
pairs hunted up in last week alone . It is just that the camp is kinda
tricky and thus outside the realm for most pickup groups. Really I have only
seen  few people besides my guild actively hunting here yet. This also means
that untill we are completely equipped with what we want we wont sell them.
Be another week or two at least before they really enter the general market.

Oh and I was there before when aggro was a problem. I much prefer being able
to sit thank you :p
