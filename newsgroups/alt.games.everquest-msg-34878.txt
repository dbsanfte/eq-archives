I was happily soloing the DE guard in Nektulos by the
lavastorm zone. My xp bar could not have gone up any further.
I mean NO room for the blue bar to move except to ding. My next
mob pops, I kill it handily and was disappointed to not get my DING!
As a matter of fact, my xp bar returned to 4 yellows. 
I reported this to a guide, who said do a bug report, and maybe I would
be
able to recoup my lost experience ( or hour of my life, depending on
your perspective).

So has anyone else ever had this happen to them before?

If so, I would like to compile some numbers to prove to Verant
that it is a valid bug. I know I will never get my xp or my time back
but I am unwilling to accept that "This has never been reported before"
tripe.
I shudder to think how much effort is even put into verifying bugs that
are reported by players.

Cheers,

Troy
