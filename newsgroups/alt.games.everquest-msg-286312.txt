The numbers listed on instruments are 10 times the multiplier on the
base power of your song.  Without any instrument equipped, you
essentially have a modifier of 10 (which means, multiply by 1.0).  A
regular hand drum, with "Percussion 18" means that your percussion
songs are 1.8 times as powerful.  So, a hypothetical 10 damage/tick
chant would do 18 damage per tick with that drum equipped.  The
Combine drum, with "Percussion 20", means percussion songs are 2.0
times as effective.  That same hypothetical chant would now do 2.0*10
= 20 damage per tick, instead of the 18 you were getting with the base
model drum.  So, your shiny new Combine drum is about 10% more
effective than your old one.

That is likely true.  The improvement was probably too small to escape
EQ's rounding down of fractions.
