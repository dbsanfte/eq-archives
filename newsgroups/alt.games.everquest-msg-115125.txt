    Some of it was gimptastic, but not the stuff FoH was complaining about.

    Inferior in what respect? The 15 points of resists? Or the effect that
you already had on your Dain belt / Chardok bracer? Even with the soft cap
on AC, 30 AC is a useful quantity. And you don't happen to mention that in
the post-first-nerf form it was vastly better than Vindi BP for all the
OTHER plate classes that could wear it. Most of Furor's whine was likely due
to that fact - it wasn't just a warrior BP.

    This is what I'm against. If it IS better than anything else, you will
pursue it ANYWAYS. Really. If you want to be the best, and that's one of the
big driving factors for top-tier guilds, you will go get this even if it had
the exact same stats as Vindi BP plus 20 HPs. Assuming the time sink
guarding it isn't completely mind-numbing.

> give it back the +dodge mod

    Can you tell me what the dodge mod would do? What exact difference it
would make to your ability to tank? How many HPs would it take to make you
tank as well? You have seen the parses on what the total combined effect of
Parry, Dodge, and Riposte is on damage mitigation/avoidance, right? Yeah,
that dodge mod would help - and you complain it wasn't good enough.

    Aye, agreed. But FoH complained about Seru - their own personal mob -
and not so much about Ssra. That tells you what the priorities are.

    Look at the posts from the focus item debate. They wanted focus effects
put on what mob's loot, again? Ah, Vulak - a mob no longer in game which
they had been killing longer than anyone else. Why not on Vyemm loot (the
real "toughest dragon in NToV"), or spread on selected items throughout NToV
and across other top-tier mobs? Ah, because then other folks would have
them! FoH posts are the very definition of self-interest, and should always
be viewed in that light. They don't want what's best for EQ, they want
what's best for FoH.

    They're considered "best in slot" based on what little we know of the EQ
game engine, based on parses. I will freely admit the devs don't have a clue
what stats players value, and frequently don't know how their own engine
works (Frontier Mountains dropping the best weapon in game was the big clue
there). But I'm also not convinced that conventional wisdom like "10 HPs to
1 AC once past 1350, you're at soft cap anyways" have been proven so much as
believed. Hell, I can't imagine the sort of testing necessary to determine
that someone with 7010 HPs and 1350 AC tanks as well as someone at 7000 HPs
and 1351/2 AC against all mobs you're likely to tank.

>7k+ buffed HPs and am wearing CT
> single-group-camp items in FOUR slots - ear, ear, belt, legs.

    Ears are a double slot, count that as three. Yeah, the earrings in CT
are nice - that was an area of oversight for a long time in EQ. Your belt
would be better replaced with a Dain belt, which also gives you the Aura of
Battle effect you like. ;-) The legs are now replaceable, too - and even
before the loot upgrades, I imagine you'd have a hard time showing that AC
22 HP 65 makes you tank better against all mobs than AC 44 HP 55 or AC 46 HP
50 (to name two NToV alternates). The noise in the EQ R.N.G. alone would
make it difficult to prove.

> Legs are best hps I've seen (maybe Cursed has better now)

    High Priest has better now. And those HP legs are "best in game" for a
few classes, not just warriors - our officer decision loot system will be
put to the test again when we get them.

    Acrylia has a whole different problem going on - Verant's inability to
balance time to reward. They're quite good at balancing encounter risk to
reward, but when it comes to equating time spent at easy tasks to reward
they haven't a clue.

    RoV is insulted that their time has been wasted when they could have
gotten better loot in less time elsewhere. They whine for what they have now
to be upgraded massively, it is, and people still don't go there because the
time sink is deplorable. Seriously. We have one person that's ready to get
his Acrylia key, but it'll be a cold day in hell before we as a guild devote
any time to what has to be the most boring idea in EQ: multiple ring wars to
progress. The loot at the end could be as incredible as the engine allows,
and you couldn't get enough people to log on that would want to spend all
their gaming time grinding through that crap. Camping XP mobs to get random
rare drops is one thing, forced ring wars is quite another.

    Their complaints can be summed up quickly: "we aren't far enough ahead
of other people". They are terrified of having to share content with others.
Look at how happy they are with Vex Thal, which seems to be a totally linear
raid zone. Why would they like that feature? Because it means if they can
outrace someone there, the zone is theirs. When they ask for upgrades, they
always want retroactive upgrades to "reward their hard work", but when nerfs
come they want to keep their "pre-nerf" gear. They aren't looking out for
me, even though I'm arguably at an equivalent level of play as them. They're
looking out for themselves, and if someone else gets helped then lucky them.
