They claim to creatively create new life, structures, shape the
form of nature, and define the rules by which the world operates.

That is what defines their godhood - whether you believe those claims
is another matter, of course ;)

And, jumping back a step, I dont think godhood is dependant on strength,
but rather on nature. Another type of being, different from the meaty
mortal embodied in their flesh types strolling around on the world below.

These sorts of things are opinions that have been debated for millenia
though, so I dont expect much resolution here ;)
