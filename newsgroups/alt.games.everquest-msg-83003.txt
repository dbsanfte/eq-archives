take a look at http://www.graffe.com/ and click quests.

Was the priest you looted the key from in Unrest?  The whole story of
what to do is at Graffe's.  If that's what you did and got that
response then I don't know what else to tell you but file a bug report
for a broken quest.  Never done that quest myself so I hope it works
out for you.
