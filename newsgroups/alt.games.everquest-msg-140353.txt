Actually that is a rough approximation. Its actually a sliding scale
with Verant's 'diminishing returns' factor.

I think it probably goes something like this:

1-200  = 10 mana/int
201-210 = 8 mana/int
211-220 = 6 mana/int
221-230 = 4 mana/int
231-240 = 3 mana/int
241-255 = 2 mana/int

(Assuming character is level 50 or higher)

Or something like that. 5.8 was just a guess from casting
tests at graffe's and a couple other boards.
