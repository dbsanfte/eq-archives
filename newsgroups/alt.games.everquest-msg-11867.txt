Chloroplast + 10
Rubicite breastpate +5
Rage +35 (as I recall)
Normal standing regen +(What, 2 or 3 points? 3-4 for a troll)

FBSS, Alacrity for the shaman with a barbarian spiritist's hammer could
easily keep up with a warrior dual wielding yaks (which was basically the
best you could get at the time).

Not much ac difference between a full suit of indo vs full rune etched.
Plus, warriors at the time generally went with really shitty gear like
serpentine bracers and black pearl necklaces.
