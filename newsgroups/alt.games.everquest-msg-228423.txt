From the shadows, the mysterious Moopy <pingu@keg.zymurgy.org> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

A wandering dev would have much more of an open mind and even if he
disagreed would acknowledge points made. This Charles fellow isn't
listening or countering anything, and therefore doesn't warrant much
respect. He simply ignores everything, claims it wasn't well
explained, and then goes back to repeating already addressed points as
if they are impregnable.

Your opinion of how well I am explaining myself is duly noted; however
considering others are not having much trouble and I am not really
willing to spend the time to lay out my entire perfect mmorpg, I am
not worried.

I do not agree. Simply making it both difficult and actually
penalizing should be enough.

Note UO did neither, which is why it is not a good example to use.

Too much assumption of gamey mmorpg systems in there. You're still
thinking like it would be like EQ (gamey) or UO (poorly implemented
not attempting to accomplish the goals I've mentioned). Heck your
still assuming such things as "disposable toons" could even exist.

Again, assumptions of EQ style world, character/level systems and
balances.

Quick point - had there been no /ooc or /shout (gamey elements) there
could be no verbal harranging. One simple step and you've already got
something. Before you give the obvious reply let me remind you that I
am speaking again in holistic terms and just eliminating the zonewide
channels is not a solution by itself.

Already addressed.

Implementation sucked and the numbers for comparison are way too low
to make a judgement.

Let me use another example: early attempts to make a vehicle that
could fly were woefully inadequate and didn't do the job to put it
mildly. According to you, because of a few failures, vehicles that fly
simply aren't possible, and people should stop trying to make them,
even though there is a population that *wants* to fly.

The point the article author was making was that because another form
of transportation is available and successful, all efforts are now
being made to get in on that. No one is making planes, because
everyone seems to love steamships which we know work.

Well, I want a plane! And I think a mmorpg equivalent of the Wright
brothers will come along. But right now its an uphill struggle against
all the steamship makers, most of whom are not really making any dent
after the first big steamship Everquest was built, but who are
unwilling to invest in making planes because the implementation hasn't
been done right yet.
