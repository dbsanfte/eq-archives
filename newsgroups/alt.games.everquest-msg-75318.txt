This is something I've often wondered about: VIA seems to be the only
chipset that requires downloading drivers beyond what comes with
Windows to get decent performance and stability.  You generally, with
other chipsets, only need to download drivers to fix bugs, or squeeze
a very slight performance boost out of them.

Why is this?
