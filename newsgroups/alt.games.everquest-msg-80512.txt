 Agreed. Don't put points, other than the initial one, in combat related
skills.

 Agreed.

 Eh. I'd put that on bottom of list. Unless you're going to try soloing
outdoors a lot.

 Agreed. Training Bind Wound from 190 to 200 (196+ in particular) takes
a long, long time for most. My advice would be to buy the points to 200.
It wont be cheap, but it's faster. Then just train to 201 so you can
bind wound to 70%. You used to not be able to buy 201, but I had a
friend who said he did on Luclin. If you can do that, don't bother
training over 201 since I don't think it increases the amount you can
heal.


 In the end though it probably doesn't matter. You'll end up with a lot
of unused points. Unless you take up a lot of trade skills.
