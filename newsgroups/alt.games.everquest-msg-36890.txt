	Yes, and what part of "KOS" did you not understand?

	The guards have very small agro ranges.  If you run straight between them,
you won't draw agro.  The "killer necro" in the building upstairs has been
neutered.

	Just fyi, it took my leezard Necro 223 dog kills, give or take, to get
from Threatening to Dubious with Heretics, another 400 or so to make
Apprehensive, and then I turned in some 14 Kobold Molars which made me
Indifferent (I checked after each turn-in).  The next 10 Molars didn't move me
up, but just a handful of dog kills later I was Amiable and had my key.
