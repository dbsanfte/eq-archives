The other day I was doing some tradeskilling with my druid.  When I started
Art, I decided that I wouldn't hide under /anon or /role.  The only time she
is on /role is when a friend is botting her to port or pl one of his chars.
So, Art is in Rivervale making Tumpy Tonics.  I get a tell from someone
asking me to port him to the commons because there is a dark elf in Kith.
No shit, really?  Try staying til day time?  No, asks for me to port him.
Fine.  He promptly dies when he gets there and I report and buff him.  No
offer of a donation, not that I would take it, but not even an offer.
Another guy asks for a port, fine, port him to Nexus, and again, not even an
offer of a donation.  Even if they had offered, I wouldn't have taken
anything, but still it would have been nice to at least give me a few gold
pieces or a pelt of some sort.

I move to Freeport to work on baking (Good Ol' Fish Rolls) and I get a tell
from someone asking me to buff him.  Fine, not a problem, doesn't use a load
of mana and I give him my DS.  When you're level 2 or 3, an 11 point ds
essentially kills the mob for you.  The DS runs out and no joke, he asks for
another shot of it and wants one that lasts longer.  My eyes bulge out of
their sockets.  Now, in all fairness I was irked with the two ports earlier,
so this guy really was the ant that made the airplane fly apart at the
seams, but still.  I told him that he wasn't very grateful, and that I had
no obligation to buff anyone.  A Thank you would have been appreciated and
that he shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.  He said, fine, geez
sorry.  And I felt bad because I knew I chewed him out, but still, not even
one thank you.

Is this an unsettling trend?  People expecting ports and buffs from druids,
just because?  Or did I just have a really bad day?
