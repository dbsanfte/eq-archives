I play a ranger/cleric combo with my brother, outdoors we own, in =
dungeons he has lull so we can still pull ok (btw his all fear is PBAOE =
fear, also has spook the dead).

The only thing we have found tough is when there are groups of casters =
(more than two attacking me at once), aside from that there is nothing =
we havent been able to do yet, or that we have really struggled on.

We are only level 38 at the moment, so I dont know how viable this =
pairing is in the later stages of the game.
