I don't think the problem I'm having is memory related.  EQ isn't
using more than about 600MB of RAM and the HDD light isn't coming on
during lag.  The lag is happening in new zones as well as classic even
if I lower the resolution or bit depth which leads me to believe it's
not a video card problem.  I'm getting UDP packet responses times up
to 3000ms and drop rates up to 5% at some times in EQ.  It's not so
much a problem of the computer running slow, it's seems to be more a
problem of the computer receiving updated information on the game in
slightly less than real-time and the client "skips" segments to keep
current.  This combined with the fact that the problem is much worse
at peak times (evenings and weekends) really leads me to believe the
problem is on SOE's side.  As I'm a network engineer, I'm really
curious about what kind of infrastructure EQ runs on.  If anyone has
any info, I'd really appreciate it if you could share it.
