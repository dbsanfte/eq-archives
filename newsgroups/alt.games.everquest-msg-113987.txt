Ideally you want to be playing SoL with an Athlon class processor (or
Pentium 1gig+ for the less thrifty) with 512mb of RAM minimum. Your graphics
card should be at least geforce class, preferably gf2 upwards.

A desirable system would be DDR RAM based, but that is desirable only, not
critical.

I have an Athlon Thunderbird 1.2Ghz with 768mb pc133 ram and a 64mb geforce
3 ti200 and it's sweet with clipping plane way out and everything on at
1024*768 res. My 17inch monitor is too small to go any high res and remain
usable so I am unsure how much further it can be pushed.

Some people have no problems with a lesser system, some have problems with a
greater one though. If you build it yourself and carefully avoid bottlenecks
then the above or better is ideal. Premade name brands are pretty much
bottle neck hell though, make it higher spec if name brand.

As for DAOC-  I have to leave that for those that have played both ; )
