Yeah, high level people sometimes get bored with their stronger characters
and decide
to start a newbie character, so you'll have plenty of people to play with.
However,
most of these other people are "twinked", that means they get equipment from
their
higher level chars. This could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on
how you look at it.

It doesn't matter when you log on, if you have enough time you'll probably
be able to find a group,
especially in popular zones like Paludal Caverns. If I turn out to be wrong,
Druids, Necro's and even
Shamans and Bards (or wizards at higher levels) are excellent soloers.

A lot of things will be different in EQ2 but it should basically be the same
idea,
so you'll have a decent foundation.

It

These are fairly strange names for quite simple things, you'll find out
what they mean in no time. For example,twinking is giving a lower level
(your own or somebody else's) character better equipment or money.

> 5) Is the server list I see (EQ Gold, UK) only populated with Europeans,
or
> are the servers world-wide?

There are some European servers, but most servers are based in the US, and
used
internationally.

> 6) I have all the expansion packs, but no idea how to use them?

Just pop the CD in and install them. They add continents and features, if
you travel
around a bit or just look around you'll find out what they do pretty
quickly. Look
around on the internet for extra help with what expansion adds what.

Well, of course you can always ask around, and you may have a hard time
soloing
in some places. It may be a better idea to move to another area if you can't
handle
a particular area solo.

You can ask them for their /loc and then use /loc until you get their, or
you could
ask one of the members to come pick you up.

There are some zone connection maps but mostly it's just knowledge you
acquire when travelling
around.

It should be a perfectly good server to start on for anybody. You can always
try a more
"established" server, but it'll have higher level people and a different
economy.

> 11) Is magic and spell casting complex?

Not at all. You buy a spell, scribe it into your spellbook and drag the
spell into one of
the slots on the left. Then click the spell to cast it.

> 12) Are there any UK guilds / groups worth joining as a casual.

Of course, but you'll have to look around on the net or ask people on your
server
about which guilds are based in the UK.

No problem. Hope this helps, if I'm wrong on things I'm sure people will
correct me.
