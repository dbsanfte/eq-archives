Our guild use a ranger weapon sheild it first.  Have everyone stay
behind and only the ranger up there by himself/herself.  Activate the
weapon shield when the dragon becomes alive.  The slower then have
some time to land slow.  Once slow is landed, the MT goes in and the
ranger chain cast jolt.  Put DI on the ranger if you want.

My ranger had do this task several times.  Only die once.
