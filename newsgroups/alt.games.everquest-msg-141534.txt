Hi,

You guys are stupid for not paying attention.
Right from the word go release dates for both the standard 2 disc and the
extended 4 disc version were available.
In DVD adverts both were advertised together.

Its not like he released the 2 disc version and then 2 weeks later said oh
by the way a better one is coming out soon like certain other DVD companies.

The film itself is fantastic, the only thing your really going to miss is 30
mins of movie, but your seeing exactly what you saw in the cinema.

Bye,
Pete
