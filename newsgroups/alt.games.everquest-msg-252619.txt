The Guild I am in on TM uses DKP in the way described by Lance Berg (in
another reply) and it seems to work quite well.

My previous guild didnt use any system at all of tracking member
participation and ... fell apart due to lack of activity. Not that we didnt
have activities planned, just... no one was motivated to come to them.

In balance, I think the DKP (or other point systems) are superior to
policies of guilds which simply require members to attend every event or you
get thrown out. The points systems allow a greater flexability for the
members while still promoting fairness in distribution of guild "bootie" :)
