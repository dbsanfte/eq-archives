I went back and re-read what I thought I had... and still maintain that it's 
seperate, and that I'm being charged 2 times...

Especially, when my bank statement shows a 14.95 charge for Sony on 2 
accounts, and 29.95 to Sony on 2 accounts...

Not sure exactly how I get rid of the station accounts without screwing up 
my EQ subscriptions, which I had thought all along were the same thing, 
since I was using the "new" knowledge base for answers to other questions by 
"signing in" with my Station accounts.

So, it seems that I'm actually "stupid" enough to be paying $43+ a month on 
each account to be able to play EQ and /petition.

Any less than acerbic comments? Suggestions? Obviously, I haven't had the 
extensive background with this game that some here have, so I don't have a 
clue as to how to get rid of my Station accounts(if not needed to play game 
and petition).
