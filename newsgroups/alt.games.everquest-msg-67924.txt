So a 36 warrior enlisted the help of my 30 druid to knock over one of
the Shar Val guards today.  I used harmony to split, snare to pull, and
ran him back to the warrior, then he took over and I kept him healed.
First try we used DS and
DOTs... and found out he had over 3K hp.  Second time around Ensnare and

GHeal were the only spells I cast, and I med a lot...

At any rate, I zoned out before death, so I don't know what the faction
hits
were or how bad, warrior said shar val guards was it.

Drop consisted of a shield, AC 20 none none... and a sword, 5/20,
weight 0.1.  Both were no drop, and I imagine there is a quest somewhere

for the shield, or else none none is an error or its just there to
torture us.

Unfortunately although the sword is curved, its not druid usable... as I
only
carry a weapon for whacking greenies anyway, and for the look (if I'm
serious I have a stupid looking doll in that slot) and that sword looks
-great-... in the hands of a Shar Val anyway, it looks just like it does
in
the hands of the guards.

While no drop, the swords are not lore, so it would be possible to
dual weild them.
