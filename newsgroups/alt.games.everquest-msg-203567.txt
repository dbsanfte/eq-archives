Not silly.  My druid hunts animals all the time, but never leaves any
type of loot on them; if he's going to kill them, he's going to use
all of what's on them.

My ogre shaman Ughk won't heal magical types (druids, wizards, mages,
etc.) *unless* they're doing stand-up combat.  If they're willing to
fight, Ughk's willing to heal them, because they're doing what Rallos
Zek wants.  If they're just gonna run around, nuke things, and avoid
fighting, then Rallos Zek's power shouldn't be used for them.

Reyder Axeman, while hunting in LGuk, let everyone in the area know
that he would not, under any circumstance, help them fight live frogs.
Dead frogs, yes.  Live frogs, never, nohow.  Several people died
believing that he'd step in and help them against the live frogs.
Funny thing was, the only ones who never complained about it were the
Ogres hunting there.
