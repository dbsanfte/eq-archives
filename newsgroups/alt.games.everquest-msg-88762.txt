}Reminds me of something I heard as a guildie and I were fighting the low

}there to claim the no-drop prize (IIRC, mask of deception).  He had already
}been doing this for ten minutes when we got there, and there was a group
}that wanted the room.  How does everyone see this?  I think it was a bit
}assinine, even though it's legal.

Well, look at it this way, the group wanting the room has a choice:

(a) let him toy it about for another 5 minutes or so until his guildie 
gets there.  Consequence:  He probably leaves, they get the camp in that 
long+respawn time (28 minutes in lguk, is it?)

(b) Insist that he kill it -now-!  Consequence:  Well, obviously, he has 
to sit there and get another one to spawn.  Could take hours.  Guess they 
should go see if Sage and friends is open or something.

Of course, he aggroed the mob, he can kill it however he bloody well 
wants, or we're gonna get the druids ond wizzies in a war here.

"Dot kiting?  That's gonna take you 15 minutes with that giant.  Far too 
long.  I'm nuking it to death, and tough noogies."
