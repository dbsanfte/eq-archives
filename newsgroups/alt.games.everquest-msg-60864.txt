Pretty sure not.. or totemic. I think they said they will have their
own armor quests much like the Iksar ones which were actually superior
to totemic, darkforge and crafted. The iksar shaman quest armor was
especially good and easy as hell to get even on your own at level 9 as
long as you had money for the gems (well the helm required a bit of
help since it was at bottom of kurns)
