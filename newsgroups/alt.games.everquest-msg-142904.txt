Bite your tongue!

Kendrick asked the Safehouse what rogues wanted to see
for a particle effect.  The choices were either 1) Blood dripping off,
2) No effect (rogues are sneaky...and having a flaming knife
doesn't help that), and 3) something subtle.

The rogue particle effect is a single pixel of green running back
and forth along the blade.  It is supposed to signify a drop of poison.
I don't like that, though, because I've always thought that the rogue
epic needs a poison proc.  Not even a good or strong one...just
poison for RP reasons.
