The way it usually plays between me (enchanter) and a wizard is their first
dd takes down my rune and does a goodly amount of damage besides.  I'm
usually fast enough to get a tash off and start casting a mez before I get
hit by a second dd.  Sometimes I get hit only once before the mez hits,
sometimes twice.  Since I wear charisma gear (so what if my electrum star
ruby ring gets ganked?  I'll make another, 70 plat) a mez will usually stick
on a tashed opponent first try, unless they have very high MR in the first
place.  If I'm having problems mezzing I sometimes try to pillage
enchantment, but that's kind of slow and might not be the best idea against
a skilled wizzie.  A couple mezzes almost always do the trick though.  Once
a mez is on, it's a whole different ballgame.  ToT and mana seive to your
hearts content. Then break the mez with a pillage, throw a slightly quicker
dd (say anarchy), remez.  Seive some more, sit down and med a bit...  Recast
rune on myself, laugh at my victim.  wait for ToT to refresh.  Once it does,
ToT, dd, mez, dd, mez, etc etc...

Against a necro it's much more difficult.  If they have a pet up, then I'm
probably going to be dooomed by dots by the time I can get the pet mezzed.
After that it's simple to get the necro mezzed (unless they've dotted
themselves in which case it's color stun and run like crazy until the dots
kill me).  If the necro was petless or I was fast enough on mezzing them
both, I may have a chance to survive in which case it comes down to the
exact same thing..  Drain all mana, dispell, lock down, and destroy...
