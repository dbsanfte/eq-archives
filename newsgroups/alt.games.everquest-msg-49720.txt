Put all you can into Charisma and the rest into Intelligence because it is
MUCH
easier to find intelligence raising items than Charisma raising items. A LOT
of
the best Enchanter spells use Charisma.

TO SOLO:
1.Get tiny daggers and create a pet. (I think Qeynos area you have to get
them in
Erudin Inside the casters guild. (Look for the hall painted yellow. That is
the chanter
hall.)
2. Using Tashan to draw them in, let your pet attack them. (you cannot give
your
pet commands, he will only jump in when you get hit.)
3. Cast your Damage over Time spell (DOT) I think it is Shallow Breath
4. Cast your fear spell and let your pet beat him down. If you like, you can
equip a weapon (I suggest a 1h bash weapon, but pierce weapons are nice)
and help beat him down. When fear breaks, recast fear until it dies.

CONGRATULATIONS! you have just Fear/Kited your first MOB.

Try to find a higher level enchanter to "teach" you. By watching them
operate you will get a better feel for how to solo. It is a bit harder than
most classes, but it can be done, and is rewarding as well.

www.eq.castersrealm.com is a GREAT resource for enchanters.

BTW if you create a new enchanter, choose Agnostic for your faith. MOBs
can see your faith even through illusion spells, so being Agnostic will make
life MUCH easier on you.

Welcome to the Enchanter class. It is a tough class to play, but it is SO
rewarding.
