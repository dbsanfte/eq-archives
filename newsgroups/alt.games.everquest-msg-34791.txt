 As I said, depending on filters. You can filter out other peoples spell
casts so you wont even see 'A_Druid_01 begins casting a spell.' This is
basically standard procedure on most raids with a high number of people.
I can tell because of the lightning sound, but I don't always have sound
turned on.  Thus the context of my original message.

 Don't ask me. I didn't say it.
