Hi:

I'm hoping that someone might be able to shed some light on something rather
mysterious for me? I like to keep a check on the actual dates I get my
AA's - When viewing my log file I've noticed that the last entry was on 9th
September! I haven't changed any settings at all, my character config file
states LOG=TRUE .. However, nothing's going to the file whatsoever. This is
the case for the few alts I have too, all stopping mysteriously on Sept 9th.
Anyone have a clue as to what has happened? The file for my main isn't
*that* big - just over 60 meg actually.


Many thanks in advance ..

Stevie.
