I agree with you about the hair colors...I'm a red-head in  RL, but I
wouldn't make my characters red-heads because the shades they chose don't
look natural.  They look like folks who have dyed their hair. Oh well :)

What _really_ gets me is this obssession with short hair on
half-elves. Hello!  Does something occur with the mixing of the human and
elven genome that causes hair-folicles to be stunted?!  <trying to calm
down>  Yes, they do look cute still, but...but...I want long hair. <pout>

I don't suppose they would be able to add new hair styles in the
future? Or is that like the "extra velious textures" in that the memory
couldn't handle it?
