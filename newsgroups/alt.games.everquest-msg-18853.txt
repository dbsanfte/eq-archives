No, bash away.  It will not affect the speed of your primary attacks.
However, I guess it's possible that  stunned enemies have a lesser chance of
defending themselves, which would mean you'd hit them more often...

Not that I've noticed, but DO NOT EVEN THINK OF MOVING when you are
casting/about to cast.  I am a nervous fighter, I have a habit of ticking
myself back and forward slightly at random intervals, and I have to be
careful to stop that when I'm casting.  Your worry when combat casting is
not whether the spell will affect your attacks, but whether your attacks
will affect the spell.  I may be imagining this, but it seems like I fizzle
much more in combat than out.

Any character with Dodge will automatically attempt to dodge when something
swings at him.
