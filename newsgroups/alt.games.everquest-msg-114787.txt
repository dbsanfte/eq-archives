Tell me about it. Fifty five levels of playing a Troll Warrior really
sort of engrains that mentality into you. Switching to a wizard now has
been challenging in groups, to say the least. One of my first group
experiences since starting up the wizzy again was up in Dawnshroud
Peaks. We were pulling near zone in, and things were going fine, but
there were a few other groups in the same area. Soon the inevitable
happened and another group picked up a big train they couldn't take and
hightailed it to zone. Of course, we were now on the hate list and were
suddenly swarmed with about a half dozen mobs, several of which conned
red to me. 

I immediately went into reflex mode and yelled for everyone to run to
the zone while I began attempting to root them all, one at a time. (And
in the process, putting me at the top of the hate list for each.) The
warrior looked at me as if I were insane.

/sigh

I'm getting better about running away with the rest of the skirts now,
though. I even made a hot key:

/g OH CRAP! I'm running for the zone like a ranger! HEEEELP!

Not as effective in a group where one of our rangers is tanking, though.
The sympathy level goes waaaaaaaaaay down for some mysterious reason.
