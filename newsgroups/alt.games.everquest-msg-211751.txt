Theist-without-religion.  That's the first time I've ever heard that phrase,
and it may well best describe my status at the moment.  If I can take
nothing else away from this thread, I can take that.

Thanks! :-)

/agree.  And it seems that the more fundmentalist the religion is, the more
that type of thinking comes into play.  That sort of hypocracy is part of
what has ultimately driven me away from the church I attended.

OTOH, the person in need doesn't really care.  So long as they get the help
they need, the motivation of the person delivering the assistance really
doesn't matter to them.
