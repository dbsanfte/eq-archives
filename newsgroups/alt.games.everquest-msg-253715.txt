Back end changes that help SOE are not community driven changes.  Not 
that the rest of the changes weren't community driven, not that I don't 
appreciate them, not even that I fault SOE for also making some changes 
that make working on the game better for SOE... but the writing here 
contradicts itself, and could have been done better.

Whoa, do we get free wine coolers with that?  Or is the use of the catch 
phrase subtle product placement, and SOE is getting free cases of 
Bartles and James just for using it?
