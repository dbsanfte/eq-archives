There seems to be a few who sit on top of the monster spawn. they do nothing
but occupy the space so when the named mob pops they say it hit me first and
its mine you ks it. The ph and mummy in  befallen is one such spot there is
only 1 spot  where spawns for the quest pop from. the camper cycles through
the horiffic time of waiting for a ph killing each and dealing with the now
heidious mob trains from the new befallen while some jerks sit on the spawn
claiming they will ks the mummy and dont have to move. the gms said would do
nothing something about share the spawn. there is no spawn to share on these
type spawns those rules apply to wc orc camp share rules. also since the phs
shout to the zone totally visible words lvl 60 druids starts setting up shop
also at end of hall waiting to fireball the thing. ive been run off of orc
camp in misty by jerks either a few lvl s higher not respecting the camp ive
politely shared that and wc orcs ive grouped with those that wanted to camp
things ive had some try to take fungus camp our groups have been run out of
cc at times because some group/guilds move in with 3 groups that suck the
place dry, and now they tell me to share a mummy that drops 1 ring i need
while i kill ph after ph and all non-important pops from the spawn and even
derail trains i have no chose to finish while a lvl 25 or so erudite
cleric/sk what ever sits on the spawn.
Squatters must go. you cant sit on a corpse of a player you pk and kill him
over and over or at the bind point pop either  or so the rules say but what
did i see all the time before the lvl 6 pk rule non-attack came out?/
somethings go to give they dont enfore rules they should and they enforce
removing players that were good to the game leaving seething rotten bunch of
skum non-camp respecting players in.


/offical rant over its live its real and they are all over the place on my
server.
