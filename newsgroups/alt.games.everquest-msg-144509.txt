There is always the one oddball exception to every given rule. My baby
Rangette (Level 27) was grouped with a 29 Shaman, 26 Shadowknight and a 25
Rogue about 3 days ago.

Her Ikky Breastplate, Turtleshell Belt and Shaman's regen meant she was
gaining 14hp per tic standing. We found it most efficient for the
Shadowknight to pull but not taunt and for me to take over aggro almost
immediately when the mob arrived, kicking, taunting and generally letting
the dual wielding lammies speak their soft whisperings.

Rogue knew to stay opposite me at all times, no chance of aggro swapping and
by the time the mob was death marching the Shadowknights 6hp/tic regen had
mostly healed him back up from his pulling damage.

Only very rarely did the Shammy actually have to throw heals on me, we just
let the regen do it's work aided the fact I could sit whilst the
shadowknight pulled. The Shammy was very happy to be able to get off his
butt for a good part of the time and help work up his own mellee skills as
it was a very efficient setup manawise (no buffs, just regen, slow and the
very occasional heal).

It's fun sometimes to get into a non ideal group and see what a little
improvisation can do. Of course the higher the levels become the more
difficult this becomes.....
