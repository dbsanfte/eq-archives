Math is great, but like most things, it's good as the information you
put into it.  And even then, numbers can be fiddled with.

As a wise man once said, "Figures don't lie, but liars can figure".
Just because somebody shows you some nice numbers, don't believe them
just because they know how to add.  And if the number don't go along
with real world results, there is obviously a flaw somewhere.
