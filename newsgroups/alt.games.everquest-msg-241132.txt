I guess it is a matter of what you are used to .. Nvidia state the
FX-5200 is DX9 capable but as you can see from the article I quoted
there are problems with that implementation.

Try having a look at a system, if you can that is running all of the
eye candy turned on .. you will notice a difference (I am running 2
systems Radeon 9800 Pro and Radeon 9600XT) I certainly notice a
difference from my old Nvidia TNT2 Card and Geforce 3.

Zone times improved .. much less lag in Bazaar (and I do mean much
less) ... crisper picture ... no pixelation ... etc etc
