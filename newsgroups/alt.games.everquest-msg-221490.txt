    Monks and rogues both have methods that allow them to drop down the
aggro list, though. Rogues Evade, monks Feign. Of the two, Feign is the
weaker one, but it is available. I find with my rogue that as long as I
Evade I don't get smacked, no matter who is tanking (and I've had warriors
five levels below me, 56 rogue to 51 WAR, as MT). It's the people like
wizards, mages, and druids, who don't have that easy way off the hate list,
that get eaten.
