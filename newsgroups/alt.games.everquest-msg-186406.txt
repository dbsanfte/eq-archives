>Charm in PoD

Actually, if they are open, the flys right by the entrance are awesome
for root&rot.  Die (relatively) quick and give really nice exp.  Fewer
HP than most of the stuff in PoD, and easier pulls.

>Charm in PoN

PoN is awesome for druids, IMHO.  As for charming, unless you can get
on the nightstalkers, remember that the only thing you can reliably
charm 100% of the time is the young bats, and they are wussies
compared to the rest of the stuff in PoN.  Maximum level on Call of
Karana is, IIRC, 52.  Ravens seem to be right around 52 and 53 so it's
a 50/50 chance you'll be able to charm them.  If you're going to try
to charm a raven, pull it, snare it, THEN try to charm.  If you get
the too high a level message, then just root and rot.

>Root/rot in PoI

>Group or root/rot in Umbral Plains (elysian armor!)

I think some of the Elysians are 57ish, so soloing them isn't really
an option, IMHO, until maybe 58 or 59.  I'm sure people have done it
at 56, but me personally, I waited until 59 before I have them a go.

And as for the rest of the places, they're all good but just purely
for exp, NOTHING compares to the planes.  It's almost silly the kind
of exp you see in PoP.
