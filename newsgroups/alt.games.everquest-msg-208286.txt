i kind of think that since this is THE boss mob, the loot is more trophy
than useful (if you can kill it with gear that drops off mobs before it, you
dont need it's gear to progress through the game) . . . so WIS for int
casters is just like saying "yup, uber...i am uber...i have 255 wis, and i'm
a mage. what's ma name? uber~"

no?
