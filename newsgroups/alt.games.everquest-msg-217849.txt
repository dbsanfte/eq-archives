    I can respect that view.  The vision has certainly been taken off
the shelf near the bowling trophies and stuck in a box in the attic.  I
remember when there was a vision guiding the development of the game,
and it is certainly different than it is now.  The game was harder, in
the sense that one had to spend more time and often work with more
people to accomplish tasks or goals than they do now.  It also made it
more rewarding, usually, when those tasks or goals were met.

   That said, the vision also made the game more frustrating than fun
alot of the time.  It was awe inspiring the first time one took a boat
or ran cross country and realized how big the world really was.  The
20th time one made the trip, though, the awe was just replaced with ire,
at least for alot of us.  It made sense, with the vision in place, that
caster had to stare a the spell book while medding, at least to level 35
(for the time that I started).  But, it was boring, and many found it
frustrating to be paying to play a game, and be forced to be effectively
blinded often and considerable lengths of time.  And overall, the level
of gear available was lesser than it is now, thanks to the bazaar. 
People really wore bronze or banded, and felt that they were pretty well
equipped.  That simply made most things more challenging to kill.  Temp
and Kei?  No.  People had to learn how to manage their mana during a
fight, and to pay attention to what they could do with close to their
native hitpoints.

   I feel there were benefits to all this.  If you met someone in their
forties, there was a good chance that they knew how to play their
character.  Getting a surname actually felt like an accomplishment. 
Hell, doing just about anything felt like an accomplishment.  And there
was just the special feeling of playing a game that truly felt
"visionary" that I have trouble describing.  That feeling is certainly
gone, at  least for the most part.

   However, I can't say that I miss the Pain in the Ass factor either. 
If one had less than two or four hours to play, one could easily spend
most of one's time just traveling.  This could often be an interesting
process, but there was a mind numbing aspect to this as well.  In fact,
alot of the currency of the vision was tedium.  Many people, myself
included at times, felt a bit annoyed at the forced tedium we were
spending our money to endure, and wasting our limited playing time with.

   Eq certainly has a different feel to it these days. I can really,
really see why one would prefer a return to the visionary days.  But
looking at everything in the balance, I cannot honestly say that I am
one of them.
