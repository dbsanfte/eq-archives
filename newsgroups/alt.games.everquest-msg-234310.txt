I hate the p/u groups for that reason.  I usually only group with
friends - otherwise I 2 box somewhere.  When my buddy logs on we 
immediately set up and start pulling somewhere - even if a tank isn't
available.  With his aa's, I can trivially tank HoH mobs, and 2 pets
a mage and a wizard all add up to decent DPS.  We don't kill as many
mobs an hour as we do when a real tank and a 6th person (usually our
druidess) show up, but we kill and get xp.

His wizard is almost always the GL in our groups, so that's just bonus
for us.  In fact, on the rare occasion when someone else invites I get
a bit messed up - I'm used to F2 being the wizard and F3 being the cleric -
so, when he says "rod please" I just tap the F# key real quick, hit the
numpad 5 on the mage (/assist bosra, /cast 7) then assist the ma real
fast to get back on the mob.  when he's not in those spots I get another
request 2 minutes later and the conversation goes:

Wizard: "Rod please"
Me :"I just gave you one"
Wizard: "Nope"
Me: "Bah - why aren't you GL - I just sent it to the warrior"
Warrior: "Thanks, I was OOM"
Warrior rolls on the floor laughing at Bosra.
