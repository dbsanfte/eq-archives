As a testiment to the effect of being indoors, I offer SolB. According to
the chart here (before taking into account the fact this is an indoor zone),
I should be able to track Naggy the second I enter the door - I can't even
come close (my theoretical range outdoors is 1500TU's). I know a druid with
a 175 skill (theoretically a range of 3000 TU's) has been able to track
Zordak, but Naggy wasn't up at the time so it's hard to say if she would
have been able to track Naggy or not - certainly close. Ranger's are known
to be able to track Naggy from the door.

My guess from my experience of when I can and can't track Naggy is that your
range is cut to 1/2 to 1/3rd normal in this zone.
