ZEM draws the PL/XP grinding crowds, that's about it, and that's not an 
exciting part of the game. When I'm 'having fun' I'm exploring something 
new or questing or working on getting a decent item (unless I'm farming 
greens to generate a spawn or faction...of course)...but when I'm 
grinding a level I go whereever I happen to know I'll grind fastest.

Put great loot toegether with ZEM and there is no reason to go anywhere 
else.

*logically* (at least in my opinion) the ZEM should be added to the old 
world zones (particularly the forever-grossly-underused ones) to make 
them worth re-visiting. The new zones already have the 'new-ness' 
factor, and the great loot going for them.

Or better yet, randomize the ZEMs daily... get people off their lazy 
asses, and reward those who wander a bit more. Heh... something tells me 
this would be horridly unpopular with the pure PL/XP crowd... but I at 
least would find it fun, knowing that I can go "wandering in an 
screwball zone" and have a decent shot at having it be extra rewarding. 
At the very least I wouldn't have this irritating nagging feeling that 
I'd have leveled already if I hadn't left "good ZEM zone X".

Yeah, perhaps, to an extent, but at any rate, that's not whats selling 
expansions. Nobody buys an expansion because they think it'll get them 
better fast-easy-levelling zones.
