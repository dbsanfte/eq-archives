Lake of ill manners just generally sucks. I'd say you have two good options.
First is to forget LoiO and go to the Overthere where you can safely bind, bank,
shop, etc. at the evil outpost and hunt the low level mobs on the North side of
the zone. The Overthere could actually take you from 22 up to well into your
30's if you don't get sick of it.
  Second, again forgetting LoiO, is to stay near where you currently are. If you
go whack enough gnolls in Highpass you will eventaully get to dubious with the
guards and you can go fight in the Keep which is a *Great* place to level all
through  your 20's. You can also do quests to continue to improve your faction
while there to well above dubious. (My troll is considered warmly there now.)
