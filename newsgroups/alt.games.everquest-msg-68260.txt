Logged in today after getting newest patch

I have a monk and I noted that I amd running at sow speeds even though I am
not
sow!

Also, sky animation is going very fast - in fact everything seems to be
accelerated - NPC's seem to run instead of walk!

Worst part is that sometimes when I try to Mend or FD, I get goofy messages
I never seen before - like "You cannot mend again until XX seconds" or "You
cannot Feign Death at this time (client warning)"

Also - keyboard just locked up on me - everything else worked but I couldn't
type!

Anyone else see this?

I have 512 MB ram, 1.5Ghz P4, and Vistontek Geforce 3....
