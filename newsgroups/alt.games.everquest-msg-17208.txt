Ok, I think they rarely pop out in discussions. Most people seem to
play the classes that are obviously needed (Warriors, Clerics) or
seem to have the biggest Solo Powers (Druid, Necro etc). What
about Shamans? I like playing one so far, but only reached level 9.
As I like grouping, the question is: Are shamans needed at high
levels (40-50+) i.e. do they get into groups or will I just have
a very hard time? I sometimes doubt it's easy to solo a Shaman at
these levels.. Any opinions?
