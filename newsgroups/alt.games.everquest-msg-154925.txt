actually wizards are always better at DD spells than any other class.  Also
them being dedicated to doing extra damage very fast is a good reason to
have them around.  Ice Comet is a 49th level spell, and pretty much in 5
levels you'll start to realize your power at doing more damage than other
classes.  Till then, you have other spells as options.  Doing constant stuns
is a good way to take the pressure off the cleric for healing.

When forming parties, I look at several factors and abilities.  One of the
well rounded parties is the ability to group evac.  Very Very rarely do I
get into a group or like it without that ability.  That means either Druid
or Wizard.  You should always have group evac prepped, because if things go
bad, and eventually they will, one of the two job functions of a wizard just
like a Druid is saving the party from a TPW (total party wipe-out).

If you cannot find a group to join, start your own.  At 44th it doesn't
sound like you really know your niche in group tactics yet.
