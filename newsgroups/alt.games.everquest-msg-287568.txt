That's not fully correct.  A better statement would be that self 
selected samples are not valid substitutes for random samples.  Whether 
that is an issue or not depends on whether or not you are doing 
something that needs a random sample.

Research trying to establish the existence of something, for example, 
would probably not need a random sample, whereas researching trying to 
establish how common something is would probably need a random sample.
