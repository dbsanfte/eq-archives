Don't even begin to think that KEI makes a chanter useless though, it's just
one less thing he/she has to keep up with if a KEI'd caster is in the group.
I joined a group in Velks the other day with about an hour left on a KEI,
there were only four of us and I needed every bit of mana I could KEI or
Canni up.  The chanter (also with KEI) was going oom and lom trying to keep
up with mezz, tash, slow and haste, while I was slowing (the ones he didn't
get), Incapacitating, DOTing, healing and buffing.

While it certainly has changed the game, I'm not so sure it's ruined it.
Just like POK, the Bazaar and any number of other things that have forever
changed the game KEI is one of those things that make playing a lot easier.
