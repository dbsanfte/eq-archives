Enchanters are bossy.  Enchanters are mean.  Enchanters are always trying to
tell you what to do.

Abso-freakin'- lutely!

My response to that guy would have been, "ah, so you have no clue how much
more powerful I am than you.  Have fun on your unnecessary corpse recovery
later."

Once you get up to levels where folks start to figure out what enchanters
are for they also realize, well, that no matter how "mean" you are, if it
came right down to it chances are THEY, not the enchanter, are the ones
going to be the one asked to leave (notice I said "chances are," I really
don't feel like reading a bunch of replies about those few instances where
the enchanter is the replaceable one).
