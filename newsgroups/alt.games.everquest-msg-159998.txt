If we're talking about the Rhinos in the OT, then I can confirm the boatload
of HP.  I would also disagree with the poster that said they're slow.
(again, if we're talking about the OT Rhinos).  I found that the more
powerful of them ran near SOW speeds.  Add to that the fact that MOST things
in the OT seem to have fairly high Magic Resist, and they can be a problem.
The best way I found to deal with them was to lead them deep into the valley
on the way to the FM Zone, then fear kite them.  That way they had a nice
long run to get back out, and you could stick far up the wall where it was
generally safe from Dragoons.

The problem with this though, is that if you run out of mana and have to
abort, you have just abandoned a Rhino in a place where it will certainly
run across a bunch of people hunting at the ledge to the zone, and agro on
them.  The times this happened to me, I would carefully kite it back out
onto the plains, and then gate back to my bind point right next to the FM
zone.  Then I could just zone out and back in to get rid of agro, and the
Rhino was left to wander out where I found it.

Oooh yes.  Bad loot, decent XP.
