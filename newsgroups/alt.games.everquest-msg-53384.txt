That is a bug more likely to happen in some areas. What happens is the
root wore off and the mob has a "go to home point" teleport thing
basically if the player is not in X amount of range and the mob is very
low on health (if not low on health and player is out of zone it just
walkls back usually). Once it does go back
to the homepoint it heals very fast. It is something kind of stupid
Verant did so that if a player leaves or something the mob heals up very
fast. It actually happened long before kunark even, in some zones like
west karana when doing one of those bad guards like McKluskey or whatever.

To take care of that, since you are a druid obviously, you should
(especially when the mob is low on health) sit VERY close to it so that
it could nearly hit you. That way when root fades the thing can't go
home. I'm a 55 druid and I've gotten use to doing that in Cobolt scar
even on things that hit for a lot. You really do have enough time to get
up if root breaks and it moves towards you, its just so much easier since
it stacks with snare. That change basicaly made druids gods.

You got moved to the safe point, no idea why.. perhaps because to EQ you
did not fully camp out right.
