Feeble skills and equipment that is 30 levels too gimpy.  I've already
had to deal with a paper tank and the group leader eventually kicked
him out and made me (70 beast) the MT in MPG.  I required maybe 2 CH's
per mob while that paper tank needed lots of fast heals since he could
never last the whole 10 sec for CH to be casted.

So until the grinmder catches up in skill and equipent, watch out for
paper tank and fizzle-a-lot casters.  Better yet stick only with
people you know are good before the double xp.

For those who skipped on skills, it will be rather hard to get some up
like defense skill.  At level 70, peeps would need 55+ mobs (blue con
minimum) to raise def skill and those can hurt a LOT if the def skill
is like 50.
