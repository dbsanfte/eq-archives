DT stop making a fool of yourself Im getting embarrassed for you. I
suggest a class in Moderated Debating for starters. It will teach you
to avoid circular statements like above.

Really? Interesting concept that. At what point did Sony become
omnipresent like some character from Dune or this "exclusive" council

without pushing the responses into a narrow band you have created for
them.

Now DT you may have the last word if you wish or not, matters little
as Sony does not listen anyway...
