Just searched in google for yantis, found their web site, there is no
paladin guide there. Well, even if they have one, mine is MY own
playing experience. If you see anything similar, let me know, I will
defitely stop the copy cats. I was thinking about posting it free, but
just need a little bit money to cover the playing time and cost.

Thanks.
