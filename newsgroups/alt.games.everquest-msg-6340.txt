This one I will defend. The first time I made a warrior (with a 45 shaman as
main) I did not put a point into taunt for 6 levels. Why? Well you get it at
level 1 and no other level 1 skill requires a point to start it off.
Eventually I said damn I am not getting any taunt skill (in ooc) and some
nice high level warrior told me to put a point into it.
Now I will never understand a new druid with a high level character not
using snare. Actually I will never understand ANY druid not using snare
after level 8 or so................
