Well, I like some of the changes (and actually asked for them some months
back), but not other ones.

The anonymous stuff just had to go... it was too hard to find pick-up
groups, and was just a bad, anti-community building idea, IMHO.

Just turning off the language restrictions I don't care for.  I still think
they're a great idea, and reinforce RP and racial differences.  That said,
learning languages IS too hard, but the difficulty could have just been
turned down.

I don't really like /shout and /auction returning to everywhere... but then
I'm not a fan of global channels that are now being used to sell a bunch of
stuff, removing any chance of regional price differences... so this isn't a
biggie for me.

Alignment restrictions I've always liked, and are definitely RP, IMHO.   I
don't think these had anything to do with the low server population.

Changing it from one character per server to three... arrgghhh!!  This is a
really bad move, in my opinion.  Having to commit to one character, making
it more difficult for mules, etc. was a big part of this server and its feel
and culture.

Overall, rather disappointing, especially since I was the primary architect
behind the FV ruleset.  It would have been better, IMHO, to turn of fewer
features at a time, and then watch and see if peak usage went up.  After
playing on there regularly since September, my inclination is the usage
numbers are down primarily due to the anonymous stuff.  I'm lucky enough to
play with a close group of friends regularly, so picking up a group or
finding each other isn't a problem.  But if I didn't have this network of
guildmates, finding a pick-up group without knowing the class and level of
the people in your zone would be a nightmare.  IMHO, that's primarily why
the numbers are down.

That said, the population doesn't seem to be horribly sparse... I still
encounter plenty of people running around the world -- I certainly don't
feel alone, and it's great to not have to fight over over-populated areas.
I was always fearful of underpopulated servers and much as overpopulated
servers, but FV seems fine when I play (9pm-2am or so, PST).

Now I'm sure some would argue the reason for its popularity problems are
linked to TLC, but I'd have to respectfully disagree.  I think it makes for
an interesting economy, although some of the items that are normally no-drop
are too common at the high-end game, which could increase the rate of
MUDflation later in the server's life, and this is a concern.  But, I am
biased -- I was alwasy the big proponent of TLC while at SOE/VI.

In any case, I love playing there, and while I'm sorry to hear about most of
these changes, I don't think it will destroy the environment, and I plan to
keep playing there regularly.  I just hit 45 the other day, and am
determined to at least get to 50, and maybe even 60 if I have time (although
I'm getting more and more busy at Sigil -- things are really coming
together).
