Yeah, like I said, slightly more accurate. :) It may change the answer 
significantly when abs(skill-trivial) is high.

}Isn't this just like having a value of 1.25 in the old formula ?

Hmm... not sure...

mult. thru by 1.25

1.25*%Chance = 1.25*Skill - (Triv - 75)
1.25*%Chance = 1.25*Skill - Triv + 75

Ehh, no, not quite, it's like having the first value be 1.25, the second 
value be 5 points higher (yeah, big deal) and then dividing the whole 
shmear by 1.25.  Hmm... 

Anyway, the link to the discussion is here:

http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1242.topic

There's an interesting comparison test of the formula at the bottom of 
page 5 of that thread.  The other notable thing is that many peple are 
getting %Chance to be slightly above 95% for very trivial stuff, so it may 
not be a hard cap, or the hard cap may be slightly higher.
