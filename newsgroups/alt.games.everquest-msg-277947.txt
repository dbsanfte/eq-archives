Actually they've said it's like PvP (or "strict" roleplaying) and
deserves to be on a seperate server.   I don't see anything
wrong with that.   Try looking at it the same way they did
PvP -- it's "bad" for the game (and against the rules) on the
vast majority of servers.   But perfectly fine on another
where everyone signs up for it.   Works for me...

There's a giant leap of faith.   This will actually give them
a very strong motivation to do something about it.  Now
they can make money (and limit their CS issues) by
having people go through them.   Like it or not, the
people selling plat/characters were providing a service
a section of the community wanted.  That's undeniable.
Before SOE was in the situation of telling that portion
of the community it couldn't have what it wanted (and
most likely losing thier business because of it IF they
enforced it.)   Now they can enforce it -- and just put
that community on servers of their own.

You mean like where everyone started training to PK because
EQ approved PvP on some servers?

Last I looked the sky is NOT falling.   Why not wait until it
does before losing it?   (That's a general statement, not a
specific one BTW.)
