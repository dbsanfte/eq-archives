    They weren't even in combat. His ISP just crapped out, and by the time
he could have come back, the raid had left Hate. So he waited, and waited,
and levelled his previous "twink" past his main in Hate, until he told me
and I got him the hell out of there same day. But the damage has been done -
he's a cleric now, not the paladin he'd been and enjoyed being for 53
levels.
