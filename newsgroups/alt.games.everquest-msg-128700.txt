Excuse me! Randomly blowing up women and children is "fighting for human 
rights"?  I don't think so. If Arafat and company hadn't ripped off 
billions in aid and instead developed an economy and the basis for a 
state there wouldn't be a problem now. Israel is defending itself as 
best it can since the arabs served notice in 1967 they wanted war.

Excuse me! Randomly blowing up women and children is "fighting for human

in aid and instead developed an economy and the basis for a state there wouldn't
be a problem now. Israel is defending itself as best it can since the arabs
