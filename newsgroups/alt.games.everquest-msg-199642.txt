No they are not, there are The League of Antonican Bards and the Songweavers
and I guess there is no Vah Shir one as well.
Want proof? By this map http://eqatlas.com/kelethinmap.html Enter the room
that is joined to 14 and see how you do ;ï¿½)
Or, save the beating and run to zone and just check out ;

AFAIK there is no way for KoS races to raise faction with the Songweavers,
at least none that I have found which was why I was interested in how you
managed it but I am thinking you have just not had to go near any.
They Scowl at me and I am agnostic so I doubt you'll have much better time
of things.

Rivervale? Assling Bards?
Oh help me...
