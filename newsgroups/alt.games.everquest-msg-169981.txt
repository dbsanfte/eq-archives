I don't believe Marus hype someone else told me, I tried it myself... and
I'm not saying MM is a bad zone, I do it myself at 31 because Marus Seru
isn't giving me good enough exp anymore (still good but not good enough).
Now I'm thinking that possibly Mistmoor would have gven me more exp given
continuous killing than MS... but in MS I can kill constantly without
breaks, but MM (until recently) I could *try* to kill without breaks but
periodically I would have stop because I'd gotten to a place where I simply
could not kill the mobs without dying... so I'd have to go back and wait for
respawns.  Also, the reason MM is so easy for you is the C3.  MS with C3 is
dynamite below about lvl 29.  Your problem is your strategy.

From what you're saying I think your main problem is adds, and I'm guessing
that you're getting all your adds by just running up to Stonegrabbers and
saying hi, which is unwise because all their friends walking by are going to
want to stop and join the party.  What you do is pull them to the entrance
to Sanctus Seru (there's no other place that (1) has a zone if you get stuck
with adds, and (2) doesn't have Stonegrabbers wandering into aggro range
very often).  Kill them there and then run out for another one.  This is
awesome exp -- I was getting as much as 1.5 blue bubbles per kill at 26.  If
you can, kill the red and yellow ones, they are (of course) better
experience.

Of course, if you really, really like MM then by all means hunt there, but
I'll never bash MS, it's awesome from my point of view.

Of course, I was able to solo red-con Stonegrabbers there, something it
seems not many people can do (Why not btw?  They're not so tough, at least I
haven't found them to be), so I guess my experience there isn't typical.
