I am :) I have two DEs and a leezard.  I've run Ryou over a couple
times for spells and she just dinged 31 tonight - I've been wanting to
try soloing over there but didn't want to change my bind spot from the
firepots - as you can imagine corpse runs would be a HUGE pita.  Now,
well, mayhaps I will wait a few days. ^^

I really, REALLY need to level up a good character.  If only so I can
get them to Jaggedpine and grab my cheese and my casserole dish
sketches, and buy unlimited batwings without faction work :p
