I *thought* Defense was 5 points/level for all classes, but I may 
be wrong. Weapon skills are capped at 3 points/level for INT casters.

The classes do have varying hard caps for defense. Castersrealm has
a chart of these. For Wizards, 145 is the highest you can go.

Priest classes can go to 200 Defense. My druid made it at level 45. 
I had to hug the seafury who smacked that 200th point into me.
