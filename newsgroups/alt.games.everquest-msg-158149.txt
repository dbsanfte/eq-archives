Rathe Mountains. 24/7
Gem drops. (fire opals, black pearls etc)
"Bugged" tradeskills. (tradeskills where you can actually make money)
    - not a bug in my opinion, but I guess working for money isnt part of
the "Vision" (tm)
Bugged patches. Wish I was there when orcs in GF were dropping 999 plat
each.
