Elaboration mode on:
UPDATED

EQUI.xml
EQUI_Animations.xml
EQUI_FriendsWnd.xml
EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml
EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml

NEW FILES

EQUI_LoadskinWnd.xml
EQUI_AlarmWnd

My existing skins had modified , EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml and
EQUI_Animations.xml files in it. So what I did was compare the two files
together and see what they had changed in petinfowindow and animations
(small bugfix on the first I think, and added the checkbox 'bits' to the
animations file.) and put them into my custom files and awaaaay I went.

of course I made my skins myself.. if you just downloaded them and don't
like to get your hands dirty with the xml then you'll just have to wait for
the updates.
