Like hell.

Our guild alliance decided to do a sort of raid on Umbral a while
back.  Had enough for about 4 and a half gorups.  I showed up a little
late and got put in the "extra" group.  There were only three of us.
A 55 wizard, a 60 rogue, and me (52 druid at the time).

We got every kill.  I spent WEEKS giving my guildies a hard time about
that.  :-)
