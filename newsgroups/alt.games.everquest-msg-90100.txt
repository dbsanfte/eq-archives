The chat channels were full of people with thhe same problem. I crashed to
desktop when zoning into fm, was "active" for about 15 mins, but then
couldnt log in without abruptly exiting and going "acrive" again. This
happened a couple of weeks ago too when i was trying to zone into IC.

I still hang half the time i zone into GD, and have to (thanks to verants
task management disabling) hard reboot my machine and reestablish dial up
connection. Its all started since Luclin, and its getting old, very old.
