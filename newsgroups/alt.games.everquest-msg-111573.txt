No, they can't just get on a list.  If your server has been able to make a 
list people stick to, congrats, but you are the exception.

Actually, I can't tell you what I wouldn't give to have one level 60 mage 
on our raids again.  The one we had has been doing more RL thigns 
recently.

> that get kill stolen like crazy.  Quillmane, ect..  I'm sure you hear all

Uh-huh... and that's a whole lot like getting trained with dragons drakes 
and wurms trying to get Ragefire, while your whole guild is porting in, 
only to get rezzed and see another 2 guilds fighting Ragefire in an 
attempt to KS each other... and then see someone from yet a third guild 
p-loot the item.

Ragefire is the worst step in any epic in the game.  Mage pieces may be 
irritating, but NONE of them have the drama and strife associated with 
them like Ragefire.
