IIRC, turning the sound off from with in the game, I ran into this.
When you start the game, from your OS go into options and turn off
sounds from this screen. I've also noticed when turning on sound, that
it didn't do it until I actualy restarted again after changing the
settings in the options, so maybe the same holds true with turning
them off again. Hope all that made sense and you get your relief.
