 There are plenty of newb areas in EQ, the high-level folks have little to
gain from the newb areas, and usually pay well for stacks of bat-wings,
bone-chips, etc. Each race/class/society have pretty well deisgned newb
areas with quests for armor and such. Newer rules make getting to L10 very
easy, and life is pretty mundane until about L20, but there are plenty of
areas for any level of play.

It's a very well balanced so the worst that could happen is some *nice*
high-level person drops a bunch of gear, money or helps you level. Most
folks have experience one of those three in their EQ lifespan.
