While this may be a cleric problem, it may also be the rest
of the group at fault.  Cleric can't force the group to have
an MT and keep aggro on him, can't control the speed
at which the puller brings in mobs, can't control the ability
of the chanter to mez quickly and keep mez on solidly,
can't control overnukers anonymous members, can't
force the paladin/misc tanks to interrupt casters... really
can't do much of anything to prevent the group from
requiring the use of more mana per pull than he's regenning.

If you define a "normal engagement" as one in which everyone
else is doing his job correctly and any other cleric would be
regenning more mana than he is spending on heals, then yes,
this is indeed a cleric problem.

I thought Rouge was the female of Rogue?
Or cross dressing males, of course.
