okay, listen closely.  i've given you links to check out and question.  =
you refuse to by calling it BS.  I have given sources, and they list =
their sources.  you claim AI is bullshit, but you fail to challege teh =
facts that they present!  why?  maybe be cause you can't!!!!  your =
desire to be right overwhelms your desire for truth!!!
i challenge you to find a credible, unbiased, non-profit source that =
disproves AI's claims!=20

www.amnesty.org
specifically.. =
http://web.amnesty.org/ai.nsf/Index/MDE150742002?OpenDocument&of=3DCOUNTR=
IES\I
SRAEL/OCCUPIED+TERRITORIES

assuming it is bullshit as you say, can you find some concrete evidence =
to disprove their claims?
judging from your posts.. you can't. you don't know what true research =
is!!!  go on!  prove me wrong!  prove AI wrong!

you have yet to list a source!  you want more sources of information =
from those who are non-isreali and non-palestinian (beside the 3 links =
i've given so far)?

more challenges for you -=20

http://www.nlg.org/statements%20&%20pr/NLG_mideast_statement.htm
are you prepared to do the research and disprove their claims?!  if =
they're wrong, why don't you contact them and inform them that what they =
say is wrong?
i challenge you!  or is what you say unsupported bullshit, like i've =
claimed all along?!

what about this stat =
http://www.guardian.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,712593,00.html
how do you explain these numbers?  were there really 1400 combatants?  =
come now.  this is just disrespect for Palestine life!
did cars (as seen on news networks) have to run over?  did building have =
to completely destroyed? =20

http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNTP?OpenDocument&style=3D=
custo_final
how would you challenge this?  is this too much to ask for? is AI =
bullshitting?  can you find proof in the form of hard facts to disprove =
their argument?

regarding the oppression that refuses to be acknowledged by you people =
(from the international red cross) -=20
http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/5AKGCG?OpenDocument&style=3D=
custo_final
a piece from that article:

"On repeated occasions, IDF soldiers fired without warning on ambulances =
and medical staff. In March, four emergency medical workers - two from =
the PRCS - were killed in four different incidents, while other medical =
team members were wounded by Israeli fire. PRCS ambulances and an ICRC =
vehicle were also either destroyed or badly damaged in the recent =
violence. These serious violations of basic humanitarian law were =
immediately reported to the Israeli authorities."

is this defense?  there is complete disregard for palestinian life =
here!!! key words - "without warning".

quit wasting my time by whining with your unsupported opinions.  you =
whine about how amnesty internation isn't credible and yet you offer =
NOTHING to disprove their claims!!!  Arguing relentlessly without any =
kind of factual support is what? whining... much like a child would do.

what do you people cite?  FNC!!! who owns those channels?  who =
contributes millions to political campaigns???  more than 10 million =
dollars went to political campaigns in 1998, and that was from =
California top 10 contributors alone!!! (source - L.A. Times/Lynn =
Meersman). Why?  the news is skewed to the interests of these corporate =
leeches, and our politicians come from within that same group (proof - =
Dick Cheney's involvement with Enron, Halliburton).  you are citing a =
source that reports the news as THEY see fit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and you =
call AI bullshit?!! hahahahahahaha

are you going to prove me wrong? do it then!  again, i challenge to find =
facts that prove me wrong!  opinions are opinions.  find some hard =
facts!

this thread has become a waste of time.  opinions are sent back and =
forth, but little references are mentioned?  why?  the high level of =
bullshit.
is this debate or a forum of children arguing?  debate involves argument =
AND RESEARCH.   where is the research.  SLANG offered a couple of =
sources but both were clearly pro-isreali!  if i remember correctly, one =
was devoted to the protection of isreal!!! and yet, my links to AI, ZMAG =
are disregarded WITHOUT challenging the facts stated.  is the fear of =
being wrong???  one person even questioned the credibility of Noam =
Chomsky's work @ ZMAG.  did you look into his sources, which were listed =
at the bottom, or did you just spit out more bullshit?!  take a =
philosophy, anthropology, and/or sociology and understand his =
contributions to those fields.

i CHALLENGE you to find unbiased (non-isreali, non-palestinian), =
non-profit sources to base your disproval of the facts that i have =
presented to you in the link provided!
you have yet to so.  why waste my time any longer with you children who =
are unable to just that?

this concludes my argument.  there simply isn't any credible, supported =
argument for me to challenge!  i've literally gone back and copy/pasted =
replies.  its become that redundant.  Assuming what i say is believed to =
wrong, including my sources, (as is the case with many of you) - can you =
present hard facts and unbiased sources to prove it?  i have yet to see =
more than just simple opinions... long and short - but equally =
unsupported (no unbiased sources were presented). =20

(cite info from real sources.. not FNC! - take a college sociology class =
and learn something about our media's role in politics!!!!)=20

if you believe you can fulfill this challenge.. by all means.. go for =
it.  i can be found at the newsgroup alt.music.tool  - just post a new =
thread.
if you can't - at least you tried.. now you know better.

to those who supported the unbiased truth.. thank you.. you've =
recognized the truth as being the most effectively constuctive.
true realists. =20

good night.
