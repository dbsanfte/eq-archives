Yes, it is, and it's not an unreasonable one.

Of course not, otherwise all blacks would be rich because of Affirmative
Action.  I am saying that there are many whites who are just as
"disadvantaged" as poor blacks.  Not only do we start with the same poverty,
but then we get slapped across the face when we try to get a decent job
because the company needs a few more blacks to meet it's quota.  In other
words, we are being discriminated against on the basis of our race.

What the hell does that matter?  In today's society, blacks have
oppertunities to succeed without having to rely on sanctioned racism.  If
you suggest that their position of poverty puts them at such a sever
disadvantage, then how do you justify ignoring the position of impoverished
whites?  Are blacks "more equal" in your eyes?  Are they the only ones worth
giving a damn about?

I'm sorry if I sound like I'm a bit fired up, but I _have_ been
discriminated against because I'm white.  Racial discrimination is bullshit
no matter how you cut it.
