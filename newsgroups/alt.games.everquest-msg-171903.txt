    The shaman was mid-50's. He was landing slows at least 50% of the time,
once we badgered him into casting them.

    As well he might. Math to follow.

    600 HPs = three combat rounds of max hits against a spider (they double
for near-100). Six or seven realistic combat rounds. Spiders attack what, at
worst once every 2 seconds? So in 12 or 14 seconds, you're behind with
healing versus the slow? Landing a slow is priority one until the combat is
advanced enough that landing one wouldn't save you more damage than just
healing (or until you've realized you can't land it on that critter).

    Stuff wasn't going down quickly because he wasn't hasting, either. =/

    AGI, STA, DEX, STR - the full spectrum. Buffs are only good if you
couldn't get a better effect for the same mana with something else. AGI,
well, you said it yourself. He was casting DEX on everyone, not just those
with proccing weapons - and the effect of a DEX buff that a mid-55's SHM has
on proc rate isn't huge. In a controlled environment with melee-only mobs
(and single-pull Velk's sure qualifies), STA is only useful on the people
getting hit, not everyone. I'll leave it to a shaman to describe whether STR
is efficient use of mana - there's plenty of parses, and class-specific
exceptions.

    From the rest of your statement I can see I've not communicated clearly.
I don't just mean he had Dog Dog up - that would have been great. I mean he
had Dog Dog up and was standing up and poking at the mob himself, too. He
was melee attacking every mob we pulled, and wincing like nuts to keep up
stat buffs and regen on himself and to keep casting offensive spells. He was
brought in to reduce the load on the cleric (me), but his ineffectual
attacks combined with his demand for heals to keep up with his wincing meant
that net-net he was INCREASING the load.

    I've seen him around since then, BTW. He now slows everything, is
mid-60's, and seems like a pretty good shaman. But back then, ouch.

    If I see another person, same class/level, doing something simple and it
works, then I expect at least that level of "it works" from whatever the
next person tries. I'm a cruel taskmaster!
