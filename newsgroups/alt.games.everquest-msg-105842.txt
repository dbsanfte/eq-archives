About a year ago or so I read on eqtraders that one of the programmer's said
that int/wis(highest of either) did effect trade skills.  Also they said
that blacksmithing and tinkering had a second modifier...don't remember what
the second mod for tinkering was, but blacksmithing was str.
I have never been into blacksmithing, but I can say that int does make a
difference in tailoring.  With my 80int bard tailoring is slow going; but
with my 160int enchanter the increases are at least twice as fast.  Oh well,
think whatever you want, but the higher the int the greater the skill
increases, as for str and blacksmithing, I will have to try a barb against a
high elf.
