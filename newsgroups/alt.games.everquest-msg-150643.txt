Nonsense. Taking these kinds of threats seriously only encourages him to 
make further threats. Nobody kills themselves because their guild 
memebers don't instantly drop everything and rush to their aid the 
instant they demand it. Besides, if he was serious about it he would 
have done it already without telling strangers in EQ about it first. He 
is after attention, nothing more. When people make a big fuss over him 
he feels special. He is using shock tactics to gain attention. Ignoring 
him and letting him know you don't care what he does will teach him that 
making stupid threats like this is useless. Showering him with attention 
only encourages him to continue.

Ticking time bomb my arse. The only impression this boy has given me 
through his actions is a spoiled attention seeking selfish brat.
