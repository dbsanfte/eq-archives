I have yet to crash to desktop and I have a bazaar mule on any time that I'm
not using my magician.

She hangs out at the very edge of the platform (and yes, to me it looks like
I'm off, but to others I'm usually still on).

I find it painfully difficult to find vendors who are against the wall.
Usually there's another trader or two in front of you, and my gnome cannot
get to you, assuming I ever find you (and yes, I know how to do it the right
way).  Lost sale, sorry.

I think that machine is a win2k, gf4-4200, 768 Rambus RAM, P3 (p4? I forget
where the cutoff is) 1.7GHz, DX8.1 (well, whatever it is that EQ
recommends), all expansions enabled.
