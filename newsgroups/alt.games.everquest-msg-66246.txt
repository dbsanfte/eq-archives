Sounds like one way to do it :)

Can i get the rod without aggroing the hand? say like swimming up to
the edge and then grab it, worked in the shardk tank in qeynos
catacombs, just walked out that platform thing duck and pick it up :)

And what is considered safe down there, many undead froggys walking
around

/Regards Berth only 2 pieces away from that nice staff now :)
