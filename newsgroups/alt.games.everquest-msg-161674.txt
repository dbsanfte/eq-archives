Agreed - the 53 mezz is pretty big.

That's a tough one for me. I have pretty much decided to hang at 52 working
on AA for a bit to make sure that I get my epic mobs (Naggy and Vox) for
myself, but also to be there for friends that will need them too.

That said, it's going to be tough to stay at 52 when just one level away is
one of the more important songs in a Bard lineup.
