Hell, my warrior does it all the time. I generally use Slam, just because
there's a chance I'm going to get a dual wield and double attack to go off
and do nearly 100 damage to the mob .. ;) I even interrupted a caster mob
once, saving the guy from death. He sent me a tell saying thanks, and I had
no idea that I even saved him .. =)

I'm staying away from using my bow though .. Too often I'll get a crit for
45 or a crip for 90-ish .. Oops =P
