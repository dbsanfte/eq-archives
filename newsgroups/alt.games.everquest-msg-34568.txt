I seemed to get a lot of medium cat pelts from the cats in south ro.

I would skip trying to do studded armor, pelts are few and far between anyway.
I think your best bet is to skill up on cured silk to 82 then quivers to 115.
Best place for silk is upper guk from heart spiders and EK on carrion and
crag spiders.

I suggest hunting in EK both lions and spiders. Spiders for the silk and
lions to get HQ cat pelts to make Quivers.
