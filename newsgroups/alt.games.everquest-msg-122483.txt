They've all said it already so I'll not recover the whole "you deserve it"
theme.  I did, however, want to shove in my 2cp here to point out that this
is why I never, EVER agree to hold anything for anyone, ever.  Anything I
find on the floor is mine, unless there's someone standing right over it.
Anything given to me is mine - if it's made clear that that isn't acceptable
then I won't take it.

*I* know I won't steal it - but it's damn easy for someone to make
accusations like this and these rumours can go way beyond any reasonable
damage control.  I'm not saying this ain't true, Robert, just that it's why
I won't do transfers.  For that matter it's why I won't group, either.  It's
more or less the reason I rarely deal with other PCs at all.
