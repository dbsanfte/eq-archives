They actually stated WoW Open Beta starts Nov 8, which is 1 day before 
almost everyone will be able to play EQ. I think the intent must be to 
try to get people into WoW right before EQ goes live so they won't buy 
EQ and just wait to buy WoW a couple of weeks later while playing EQ for 
free right now.
