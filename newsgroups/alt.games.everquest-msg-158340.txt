You've piqued my interest in potentially putting together a chart
that shows best nuke by level.  I'm curious to see if you're really
right about druids being the second best nukers in the game.

My gut is pretty sure you're wrong, though.  For example, my best
nuke at level 27 does less than 100 damage.  Wizards beat that for
sure, and I'm pretty sure mages do, too.

As for damage shields...I don't care enough to check.  I'll let you
know if I put together that nuke chart, though.

I gave you exactly what you asked for.  Feel free to look up your
post where you made the request to see precisely what you requested.

: You mean, as opposed to cranky and annoying whiners and "anti-anti-
: whiners"?

My efforts have not gone unrewarded.  :)  A lot of anti-whiners
that I've identified and flamed in the past have stopped doing it.
I'm not sure if I just exhausted them, or they really realized
that their anti-whine efforts made things worse, not better.

Yeah, right.  Those would NOT be game-breaking developments,
and in a month, most people would NOT have quit the game out of
boredom.

: On the other hand, 
: everybody but you and Ingot seems to be quite happy with the PoK.

Right off the bat, you're wrong.  Other people think the ports
dilute wizards and druids, too.  But this time, I'm not going to
do your homework for you and search usenet for proof.  Find it
yourself.  It's out there.

As for PoK, I don't care nearly as much as you think.  I don't
play EQ enough to care that much.  In fact, PoK is sort of helping
motivate me to quit playing.  I've worked hard on my druid, and
now level 29 is meaningless to me.  I could start a cleric, but
then there's always the chance SOE will introduce NPC rezzers...

I'm not sure I want to work hard developing another character
for certain talents that might be given to all level one players
in a future expansion.

And yep, if I leave, you can have my stuff.  I'll keep you informed.

: Let's face it, there are very few true newbies in the game anymore, and 
: Sony have to cater to people who no longer find it thrilling to cross

SOE could have achieved the same result by having NPC porters
that charge platinum for ports.  The ubahs get what they want
(less tedium in terms of travel), and the true newbies that are
playing can be encouraged to explore Norrath, which really, is
at LEAST half the fun of being a newbie.
