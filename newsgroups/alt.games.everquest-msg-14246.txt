i keep hearing "spend 20 points", this is a waste, you are going to need the
bits, make them for skill

put 80 ore (4 stacks) in a pack with 40 water flasks (2stacks), leaving 2
spaces open, this is referred to as a pack of ore

even my ogre sk made 21 smithing before finishing his second pack of ore
