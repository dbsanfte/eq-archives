Although its as easy to use in your favour as it would be if they
didnt warp...

Castley thing like that. X are critters. pop inside harmony/lull crittters,
tag one. Run him into a corner. Wait. He will warp outside and go nowhere
near the gate guards "a" because he doesnt have to run through the hole
in the wall.

*Shrug*. Simple fact is shortcuts like warping break the challenge verant
tries to build into their world to make things hard for us just as much as
critters getting stuck. Better pathing AI is the only real solution ;)
