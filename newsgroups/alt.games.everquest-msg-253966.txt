Hello, I have 2 questions.

1.) My warrior just got level 39 and I am wondering how I'm doing on
AC and HP. My other character is a 55 Shaman who until the Warrior got
to level 37 was beating him in AC and HP unbuffed, so that's not much
comparison. Since there aren't too many warriors around, or
particularly around my level, I can't compare to them. So I was
wondering, at level 37 (don't have the numbers for level 39) is 1562HP
and 762AC good, or should I really be busting my ass to get him
upgrades? I understand more than any other class in the game the
warrior is defined by his equipment.

2.) Since I will probably be buying the EQ Platnum collection today so
my Warrior can head to Dulak, I wanted some suggestions on where the
best places to powerlevel as a 2box were. It has to be outside,
because my Shammy needs to sit on his horse. Needs to have a good
place to camp without getting adds, because I'm only partly effective
as a 2box, my output is dropped by about 20% on each swapping back and
forth between windows and all the errors and mistakes that makes. It
also has to have fairly high level mobs (i.e. level 45 to 50 or so.)
Single pulls would be nessisary too. Perferably it would be easy to
get to, because moving two characters through hostile ground is a pain
in the ass.

I was thinking of working the revised Lost Temple of Cazak Thule,
(since it is part of the old world and does not need the newer
expansions) but I was duoing with a SK of equivelent level (i.e. 55th)
a while back and we wiped on the first two mobs by the door. =(
