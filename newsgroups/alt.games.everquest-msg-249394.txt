I approve of torture but only in VERY limited circumstances. Well approve is
not really the right word, sometimes I think it might be necessary. Doubt
that even one in thousand of the iraqi prisoners would meet my criteria.

1)The prisoner had to already have been convicted of offenses grave enough
for a setence of life in prison with no parol or execution.

2)Proof of evidence the prisoner has that is time critical and would save
lives.

3)No maiming allowed and the man walks afterwards no matter what he has
done.
