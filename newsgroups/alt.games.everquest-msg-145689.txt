Oh my.  It _does_ look amazing. /gasp.
    I might have to be more open-minded about this game.  Which is a
shame, because I kinda wanted to hate it for possibly spelling the end
of Classic EQ.  But unless the gameplay is really, really annoying (and
certain aspects of it sound as if they might be) then this game is going
to blow the old one out of the water.
   I just hope the have a roleplaying perfered server on this one, as
well!
