This may sound strange (unless I've really missed something in the countless
days I've been playing EQ), but Amber, the jewelcraft merchant in NFP, was
changing her buying and selling prices today. I was working on jewelcraft
with my Enchanter, and although I had constant charisma, I watched the price
of a platinum bar go from 105 pp to over 106 and then back down to between
105.795 to 105.965. If there are any details I have made unclear, just ask
because I have more information and would like to figure out what's going on
=)
