You don't mention your race.

If you are a Vah Shir, you can easily get the Lute of the Jharin 
Apprentice, which is a primary slot string instrument.

If not, well, I guess 40kpp might sound a bit steep, but it was -your- 
choice not to go with the best bard race in the game.

I can't speak to the werewolf form part of the lute of the howler, I 
guess its cool and all, but I don't see the point... then again, how 
many cats want to look like dogs?

The primary slot strings part, however, is great stuff.  Heal songs do a 
good deal more healing with a string instrument equipped, and with a 
primary slot string you can do dual weilding melee with the lute on your 
cursor, and just drop the lute in in place of your primary weapon as the 
song goes off, then swap right back out again, with hardly any 
interruption to your melee output at all.  Full scale juggling (pull 
primary, swap for lute, swap for secondary, reverse process) is possible 
too, of course, but its slower and much more painful.  The cantata line 
-requires- a string instrument in hand to work, with this you can do the 
same stunt.

Another option is to put a secondary/primary instrument (like the 
troubador's mace) in your off hand and the lute in your primary hand, 
giving you both instrument types at once.

I always carried a secondary slot string instrument as well, in case I 
was swapping with a different instrument.

For 40K though... wow.  I mean, there's a ring that gives you strings 
all the time without taking up any weapon slot at all.  Then there's 
your epic, which gives all instrument types including strings.  So I'd 
think the operating life of the lute wouldn't extend into your 60s 
unless for some reason that werewolf thing is more important than it seems.

That said, the Vah Shir version of this is still my bard's proudest 
posession at level 57 (no epic yet)
