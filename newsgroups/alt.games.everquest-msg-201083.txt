That is sort of what I was mentioning there.
The smoothing factor just makes up for the blips in the above.
I think what you end up with is a smooth line from level 11 (1) to level 
50 (1.5) And then a second line from 50 (1.5) to 60 (3.1)
This should be a reasonable appoximation.

(Of course if they wanted to make it really nice they would have made it 
a curve across the whole level range, but I don't think that they are 
smart enough to get that right as a 3rd time fudge)
