And you'd be spreading lies about him.

He pays for ports, he just doesn't pay for the *wrong* ports.

Whether or not *you* thought the port was "good enough" is
beside the point.  It's not the one he asked for, and it's
not the one he was offering payment for.

It's not rocket science.

If I go into James' Coney Island and order chili without beans,
and Ben Sisson behind the counter gives me chili *with* beans,
and insists that I pay for it because in Ben's opinion it's
"easy to pick the beans out, and doesn't take long", Ben is
not going to get paid, no matter how insulting and bone-headed he
wants to be about the matter.
