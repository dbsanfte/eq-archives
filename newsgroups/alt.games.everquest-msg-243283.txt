Actually, mass farming is far more efficient.  Find mobs that drop 4+ plat
items in a zone such as Estate of Unrest (example) release your 5 or 6 toon
and mindlessly snatch copies quanities of plat.  Around 4K per hour.  Add in
"trade farms" and newer zones and that easily becomes upward of 20K per
hour.  As you cross the 45K per hour threshhold, you begin to see some
serious profit.
