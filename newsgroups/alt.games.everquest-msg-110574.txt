Ah but here's the deal, once you get INT to 200 in a minimum amount of slots
used then you can start concentrating on the HP/Mana items for the remaining
slots. If I could Free up my ring slots for instance - I could give myself
an extrea 12% HP just from a pair of Velium Fire Wedding Rings.

There is method to the madness ; )
