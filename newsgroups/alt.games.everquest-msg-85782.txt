Hello,

I was hoping someone could give me some pointers on how to get the Angry
Librarian to spawn on the 2nd floor.
I've been killing as many things as I can, sometimes clearing as much as 3/4
of the library room. I've camped her twice now for about 3 hours at a time,
but without a spawn. Do I need to kill all the students? All scholars?
completely clear the room? Someone in the zone mentioned something about an
Angry student, but I haven't seen that mob either. Any help is appreciated.
Thanks!
