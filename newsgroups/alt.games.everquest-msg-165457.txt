:cuts out a bunch of useless stuff

There is not a word about the bazaar, they should at least update it. It 
would have been great when eq 1st came out but now? Probbly not.

The following method describes how you can make from 50-75 platinum per 
hour, LOL! that's about what you can do around level 15 or so depending 
on where you fight by level 20 xp hunting just about anywhere can do 
that. And a shaman around 35 once triving sow potions can make that in 
ONE SELL! I have sold 5 and 6 10 shop sow potions to one person before.

also he talks about putting your points into wis instead of int to 
decrease failure rate, when it's the higher of int or wis that 
deterimines the chances of leveling up. So for this "money maker" 
enchanter i would put them into int not wis like this clown. It also 
appears this wasn't made recently due to him talking about cr at level 1 
if you die. How long ago did the patch that made level 10 and below for 
cr go in?

"Once in East Freeport, get off the ship and go into the
Port Authority building. You need to bind here. You can get a bind by 
shouting that you need one." they fail to say there is a soul binder 
about 30 sec away.

This basicly sounds like a guide i found once to level up baking. Also 
they talk about droping pp on the ground and picking up with another 
toon but that can't be done anymore eathier....

seems pretty outdated to me however.....
