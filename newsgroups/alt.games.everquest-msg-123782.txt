And to most of the rest of us it may mean who can function best starting
with an empty inventory.  It's a minor, but important difference.  To me,
when someone asks who is least gear dependant, it means who is least
dependant on looted/purchased items.  I realize that is not necessarily
literally what was asked, but it may very well have been what was intended.
It also may not.  It seems like a rather silly thing to argue about.
