Hmm, that's interesting - I found that a cleric is the perfect class
to PL with a mage - levels 12 - 23 in about 9 hours in paludal, then
23-31 in Echo caverns on the needlites (1.5 to 2 hours per level) then
31 to 37 in EW (1.75-2 hours per level).  The other one I could PL
pretty easily is a wizard.

In both dungeons, I simply melee'd with shield of Lava on (25pt DS).
As bugs, and shiknar don't run, it's very easy.  Needlites run, but 
they hit VERY fast, and not very hard (max seems to be about 19ish
for a level 23-25 mob), so I just rooted them at 1/3rd health so they'd
keep hitting me.  Clearing the 7 spawn gave me 4 blue every
19 minutes, and I had more than enough mana left to go take some
bogling scouts in between.

At 31 I just switched to pulling Ulthork/Walruses with Malisement,
had pet melee them down till they turned to run, reclaim pet, cleric
nukes for full xp.  Only caveat, don't do Rhinos until the cleric
is about 34, some of them are too high to nuke until then.

I expended around 270-290 malachite in this endeavor.
When I had my melee gear on at 31 I had 620ish ac and well
over 1k hp.  But I didn't keep my buffs up for the most part,
the needlites just didn't do very much damage (2 fights before
a single greater heal was needed).
