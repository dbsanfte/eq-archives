If you have 57th level barbarians in your guild, you likely don't have
3rd level rangers unless they are alts of some of the mains. (And then,
likely only 3rd level for five minutes or so, if that.) And if it's an
alt, then it comes down to the basic law....
"Is twink........ is good."
:-)

As to your comments about the first few levels...... we already played
them, thanks. The rats, bats, and bugs haven't changed much since then.
