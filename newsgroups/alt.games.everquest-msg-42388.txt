according to friends running showEQ, all xp is automatically halved for each
person in the group that the mob is green to, ie
1 party member, XP x 0.5 (1/2)
2 party members, XP x 0.25 (1/4)
3 party members, XP x 0.125 (1/8)
4 party members, XP x 0.0625 (1/16)
5 party members, XP x 0.03125 (1/32)

this is before it is even split, pretty ugly, huh?
