That should be obvious!

Fair is whatever is in the best interests of the person defining fair.

Sad, but it's human nature.    The hardcore players will want a system based
solely on attendance, while those more casual think everyone getting a drop
before one person gets two is the definition of fair.  At least half the
warriors will push for "main tank bonus points" while the healers will argue
to give clerics a bonus for attending as a "needed" class.

Not that this has anything to do with anything, just felt like ranting some.
