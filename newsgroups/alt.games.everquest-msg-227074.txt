no offense or anything, just need to get this out:

<wizard rant>
Why do people always forget Wizards? We can port too ya know? And yes,
we can port to CS too! And remember, wizards can slow and root and
invis ya and levitate ya and evac! We are more than fragile artillery!
</wizard rant>

=) ok, i feel better now. heh.

When I'm not busy doing something I still occasionally sit around in
POK advertising porting. I'll port just about anybody anywhere, with
or without donation (many people forget that donation implies optional
and are pissed when you don't "pay" them - if i say donation, i DO
mean optional, and i don't expect 50p for something that costs me
maybe a plat and a negligible amount of mana and time).

I did a port for a group to CS the other day, and just as I was gating
back, a neat little train comes by and whacks me hard. I wasn't
battle-buffed, didn't even have my battle spells memmed. I'm sure
we're all aware how long wizzies can handle that one. 3 rounds (ticks)
maybe? "Loading, please wait..." /sigh.

But the group was real nice, dragged my corpse to BW zone and even
rezzed me 96%. Even before arranging a rez, they were very apologetic,
and surprised that I wasn't even mad for having died (I felt pretty
stupid for not even having slow/root memmed).  I was a little
surprised at not minding a death myself, but I think I may have
finally stepped off of the i-must-xp-and-level-as-soon-as-possible
path, and am now on the
I'm-playing-for-fun-who-cares-if-I-die-a-few-times path. Yay!
