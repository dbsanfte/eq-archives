For PoJ exit groups there really isn't any loot except for the
Gem Drops. I'm not sure there is any cash there, and only a
few items drop.
(The Gems drop from the Sentry's of Justice (et al))
If they're hording the gem drops then I'd just suggest saying
something like:  "Hey guys, I need to leave now, would it be
all right if I got a cut from the drops?"
Just be aware that there is probably no cash there, just the
gems & occasional item.

I'm not sure if the punisher's (jail run?) have cash or not.
