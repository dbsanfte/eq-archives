Haven't done it, but saw it discussed, and it's similar to a
Ranger/Druid epic piece we just did for a guildmate in EK.  I believe
your best bet will be to have a friend with SoW near the DE camp, and
send him a tell just before you kill the necro. Then he can aggro the DE
camp and pull them merrily around the zone line while you go kill the
courrier.

We used a similar tactic for the DE Corruptor and Reavers in EK. The
Ranger doing the quest triggered the spawn, a nearly full group of us
immediately jumped on the corruptor, and a druid and a necro aggro'd and
kited the reavers until we were ready for them. The Ranger didn't even
end up having to strike a blow a the Corruptor to loot his epic piece.
