   Not the best, but certainly the best?  /ponder.  I'm going to take a
guess that the words "the best" at the end be replaced with, I dunno,
"adequate".  

    But then, that just might be because I'm a bit slow, and a bit
skeptical since I often inexplicably choose the wrong critical word when
writing that often renders my entire post/point unfathomable.
