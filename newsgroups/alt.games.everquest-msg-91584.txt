    GFay is an armpit as far as being a newbie zone is concerned. The area
near Kaladim, followed by the area near Crossroads in Butcherblock are
excellent places to hunt. Add in Chessboard (soloable) and the various camps
like Orc Spire or bandit camps (small group-doable) and you really have a
lot out there. GFay has ill-defined newbie areas (except near Felwithe, and
even that isn't so hot), minimal camps (one bandit camp in the middle of
nowhere and the zoo called Orc Hill), and diddly for wandering mob
population. GFay also has very poor landmarks, seeing as it's a big open
square. Butcherblock can be learned reasonably quickly - especially since
those dwarves get a starting Sense Heading score of 50, and have guards all
over the place.

    As for faction, my dwarf can sit in the middle of Orc Highway in Oasis
and med in peace. Back to you, Mr. Elf. Dwarven faction isn't just good with
PC races, it's also great with NPCs like Orc, whatever the Madman mobs are
on, etc - factions that cannot be raised except by spell/song/illusion. We
even used to have good faction with the various goblin races, like the ones
in Sol A, until VI nerfed that. :-(

> Dwarves can't be druids, necros, or enchanters; all fairly popular

    That is a serious knock against them - all their classes are grouping
classes. But considering the holy trinity (warrior, rogue, cleric) can all
be dwarves, and some of the top ones too in terms of starting stats, that
isn't such a limitation long-term. And given the newbie support in Kaladim
in terms of quests (bone chips, CB belts and pads being the biggest) not
being able to solo isn't so bad at the lower levels, where people don't
group.

> Most people who start on Faydwer hunt in GFay then Crushbone.

    Heh. My dwarves went to CB after Butcherblock, never fighting in GFay.
My High Elf only stayed in GFay long enough to outgrow the spawns near
Felwithe, then ran as fast as she could to Steamfront. Really, the zone is
that bad as a newbie zone. The people who are there are there to be elves,
not for the zone itself.
