Running With Scissors Launches POSTAL 2 Contest!

http://www.gopostal.com/babes/contest.cgi?id=Maninblack
 

Outrageous Videogame Developer offers fans a shot at participating in the NUDE
POSTAL 
BABES 2004 CALENDAR SHOOT

Tucson, AZ - Starting Friday, July 11, 2003, Running With Scissors, cordially
invites their 
sickly loyal fans to enter the most outrageous contest - ever. "It's every
guy's - and some 
girl's - dream of a lifetime," oozed Vince Desi, Running With Scissors' flesh-inflamed
CEO. 
"This brings new meaning to the expression 'Going Postal' - it's virgin-breaking
territory 
over the Internet."

The POSTAL 2 Most Outrageous Screenshot Contest is being cosponsored by over
30 
websites. The Grand Prize is so enticing that even the Postal Dude drools at
the mere 
mention of it! And the Grand Prize is?

One truly blessed fan will assist world famous Hollywood photographer Lee Roth
on-
location at the NUDE POSTAL BABES 2004 CALENDAR shoot.

The Grand Prize, which includes round-trip airfare, luxury hotel accommodations,
and 
partying with Running With Scissors, will be awarded to the fan who can concoct
the most 
OUTRAGEOUS screen shot from POSTAL 2. First Runner-Up will receive an authentic

POSTAL 2 thong worn by the Blonde Postal Babe at E3 in Los Angeles (delivered
in its 
original zip-lock bag to ensure tasty freshness), a POSTAL BABES signed calendar,
and lots 
of Running With Scissors stuff.

Blood, fire, vomit, animals... use your game-playing skills, your photo-shop
skills, creative 
writing skills, your audio skills - it's all good. Rules, you ask? There are
no rules! Just send 
in your most OUTRAGEOUS screen shot from POSTAL 2!
