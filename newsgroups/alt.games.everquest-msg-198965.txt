Don't worry your little brain, I wasn't expecting you to understand
the joke. That line might be a bit overused on usenet but it still
serves as an elegant and simple way of highlighting incredibly stupid
shit like those two comments of yours. 

If you ever graduate from high school or (heaven forbid) college, I
feel sorry for the people that have to actually work with you while
you come to grips with the fact that just because you read something
on a subject doesn't mean you understand it as well as people that
have actually dealt been dealing with it.
