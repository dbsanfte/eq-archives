Da`oogly stick is a CS Award given to a Guide, Senior Guide, or GM.  Items
are not radioactive, and they  are not poisonous...they are however NO DROP,
and will instantly kill a player without a CS flag if for some reason they
do fall into someones hands, as will the Guide, Senior, GM be removed for
allowing it to happen in the first place.
