The default view contains bitmapped features and remains at 640x480.  You 
can select a different view by hitting F10 *once* and retained most, if not 
all, of the information boxes (target, chat, spells memmed, etc) and gain 
the higher resolution.  Howevere, the spell book screen (and inventory if 
you do not have Velious, I think) will remain at 640x480.  Play with the 
"screens same resolution" option to reduce screen flicker when changing 
resolutions..
