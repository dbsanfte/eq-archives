Ahhh.. I hadn't thought of that, but even so, it could take a long time to
get the two together. If they want to take the trouble of trying to get them
both in the same zone without something or other killing them between times,
they are welcome to it.

I always think that power levelling  is a swings and roundabout thing. If
you take a fast train, you can miss out on some of the scenery, and the
chance to talk with other passengers. On the other hand, if you've already
seen the scenery, you might want to take the chance to have a nap.
