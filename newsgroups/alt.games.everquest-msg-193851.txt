NO No no no ...

You are playing a ShadowKnight as in a Knight of the shadow majicks NOT some
guy that doesnt like sunlight so only comes out at night ...
How hard is it to remember this ?
Every single post you have made reguarding your Shadowknight you insist on
calling it a shadownight and its down right annoying now.

And yes I have pointed this out before and will continue to do so until you
take note.
Anal?
yes.

Will that stop me pointing it out every time?
No

Ok now on with the question ...

>fighting in Highkeep. What lvl should I leave here
> and where are some options on where to go??

I have heard of people staying here until 34 but its really slow, my best
advice would be go grab yourself a Cleric or maybe a Pally and head over to
Nurga ( http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/minesofnurga.html ).

I dont think you would have much luck soloing here, but with Lull you should
be able to single pull with ease and the goblins dont hit too hard.
Watch out for the goblin stalagknight however these guys are nasty, they are
SK's and HT for around 250-350 dmg and the Firedowser and Boneseers make
nasty adds (Wizard and necro).

One thing I really love about this zone is that with Invis you can walk
through the whole zone, should make any nasty CR that bit easier (I think
its 30 for SK's invis isnt it ?)
The mobs drop around 3-4pp each, plus green goblin skin and Mt.death salts
which sell really well in the bazaar (around 40pp per skin 20pp per salt)
and you have and chance of a shroud or nature dropping too.

My beastlord was rather sad when they all turned Light blue to him, but even
in only 4 levels he had made well over 4k and equiped most the younger
druids in the guild with shrouds.

Anyway I hope that helps ...
