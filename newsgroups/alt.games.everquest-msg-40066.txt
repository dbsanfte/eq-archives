Not exactly sure how safe, but nothing attacked my 30 barb rogue who fell off
the damn shuttle trying to get to FV.  I had to swim and make my way to the ogre
island.  I did several little island hops, and swimming til i got to the ogres
and could take the barrel barge to Oasis.  Lag sucks, on screen shuttle is lined
up with boat platform, step off shuttle, splash.
