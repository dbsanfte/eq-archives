I was untwinked.  My Ranger was my first character past level 10 or
so.  (I started a Barby Shammy but quickly quit him).  I managed to
get my Ranger's stamina over 100 by around level 30.

This has what to do with the stamina bar?

Armor?  For the most part, yes.  Weapons?  Sorry.

So with all of your experience, you have decided that wisdom is the

Ah I see.  No need to discuss how damaging the weapon is, let's talk
about how much of a mana pool it gives you.

Do you swing your leggings at MOBs a lot?

I wouldn't because I know how to stay on subject.

I took mine from 1 to 65.  And it can indeed be difficult to play at
some levels.  Level 34 isn't one of those levels.

Speaking of the advantages of Rangers or SK's...when exactly do
Shadowknights get the spell Invigor?

Just plain false...only supported by the logic of someone who thinks
that you can compare Ranger and knight one-handers.

Only with a strange definition of "less".

And you extended this argument to weapons.  Rangers have among the
best selection of weapons in the game.

<laugh>

Back when I was equiping my level 30-or-so Ranger we used East
Commons.

Because you compare apples to oranges.  When I point this out, you
change the discussion.

LOL, as I recal I was giving *you* examples of one-handers for knights
and telling *you* where they drop and what level it would take to
attain them.  I did this while explaining to you why comparing a
one-hander for a knight to a dual wield class is pointless.

The very fact that I had to explain the differences to you between the
two classes speaks poorly of your grasp of the issues.  Just what is
your highest level character?  Highest level melee?  Highest level
Ranger?

Can't be too high if you think 35 or so is high level.  (It drops off
mobs that are around level 25 IIRC)

Yeah by the time I was this level I was selling things like the BABS
because I already had better.

...which is false.

comparing one handers between knights and dual wielding classes...

I have mostly spoken from my actual experience playing my Ranger,
killing in Qeynos Hills, Blackborrow, the Oasis, Highhold Pass and
Keep, LGuk and SolA, SolB, CC, ...searching for weapons in East
Commons.  ...Questing for weapons as well as the Swiftclaw Sash (yes I
did it and I still have it) in Stonebrunt.  And why is the ability to
do a Bazaar search suddenly the major qualification one needs to be
able to speak as an expert here?  Before you were clear that you were
talking about quested or dropped weapons that a Ranger or knight can
get without buying.

> It isn't my fault you guys can't grasp basic logic and drift off.

Says the guy that thinks one 'good' one-hander is better than two
so-so one-handers.

Ah I forgot about this little tidbit.  Perhaps when I wrote it the
first 3 times, you missed it.  Here is this lesson for you again:
Rangers can equip nearly anything a Warrior can equip.  If you had
played a Ranger for very long you would probably know this.  Remember
that by your own logic, knights have a better weapon selection than
pretty much any class.  You don't understand why your own logic would
'prove' this, but it is true.

> Grasp that thought and
> hang onto it.

You *really* don't like being corrected do you?

When I make a mistake (quoting myself) I respond like this:

"I have never played a Bard, but have heard that the range of track at
skill 75 is so limited that it is nearly useless.  I do not pretend to
know either way from experience."

When you make a mistake and 10 or 20 people tell you that you are
wrong, (take a look around this thread, buddy), you respond something
like this:

"You need to learn what you are talking about.  You are too ignorant
about this subject to deserve to talk to me."

By the way, were you the one who claimed Rangers are at a disadvantage
when it comes to farming?
