Middle answer

I have heard, though, that SOE recently issued some "buddy keys" which 
would unlock a couple expansions worth of the game for a second account, 
idea being, I think, that you loan your discs to a friend to install the 
game and then he gets to use the new key to set up the game itself.  If 
this is true, and you can get ahold of one of those keys, then you can 
use the disks you bought instead of having to find someone to physically 
load yours... and instead of having to do what amounts to a days long 
download if you are using dialup access, even if you defeat the software 
that prevents the patcher from downloading massive amounts of data like 
this.

The discs without the CD code are no better than a backup copy of discs 
that someone might have made for his game, the CD code is what's really 
valuable... but they aren't completely worthless.
