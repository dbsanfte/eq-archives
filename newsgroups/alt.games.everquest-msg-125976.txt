I wouldn't know, I can't play EQ at my summer home due to one of the
worst rural connections in the country. :-)

Has NWN taken any bite out of EQ's numbers? With the lustre of Luclin
gone and the next expansion a long ways off, it being summer, and NWN
coming hot on the heels of Morrowind, it seems like a perfect time for
EQ to finally enter a down cycle.

I still feel the urge to play, though :-( hope everyone is still there
when I get back....
