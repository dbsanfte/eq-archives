    I'd be surprised if it could. Mini-Aten's area is accessed via a
teleporter into a room with four guards. From there you go through a door
into Mini-Aten's room, the only ways out being a teleporter and a one-way
(out) opaque wall. Could you hop a Bind Sight through an opaque wall? The
Eye would be impossible from where they were without figuring out a way to
warp it up there - it's too far.
