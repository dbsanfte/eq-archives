Sorry to bother all of you with this but I'm having no luck getting an
answer through chat, Sony online support or the Sony forums. I can't seem to
post at the forums. When I choose to create a new post it tells me to log
on, then I log on and it says I'm logged in successfully, but then when I go
back to the forums to post a message it tells me to log in. So, forget
posting there.

Chat always crashes after about a minute.

Here's my real trouble though. I hope someone might have a suggestion.
Tonight I started to have a problem with EQ2 at the point of character
selection. I choose my character, and the window pops up that says it's
loading the character and then the game stops responding. I've never had
this problem before tonight.

Here's what I've already tried to fix the problem. I've downloaded the
latest driver files, rebooted my computer several times, turned off my
firewall, and deleted default and another .ini file as suggested by a FAQ, I
also changed my graphic options to highest performance setting and did a
full file scan on start-up.

Last night I was playing my character and my son was goofing around and
unplugged my mouse. After he did that my mouse and keyboard wouldn't work
and I had to shut down the computer and reboot. I then had trouble with my
network connection, so a lot of cussing later, I just gave up and went to
bed. This was the first time I tried to restart EQ since he pulled the plug
on my mouse.

Any chance that shutting down the program in midstream like that caused some
wierd conflict?

Or are others having this problem?

My next step is to try a complete reinstall of the program, but that's
pretty drastic. Before I do that I want to find out if other people are
having this as a new problem, or if it's something most likely  in my
system.
