There's just so many other things I have always liked doing, and I don't
feel I am doing enough of them. I have at least 25 gallons of mead that
need bottling. I have calligraphy and illumination projects that I am
falling behind on. I have too many unfinished dresses and other garb
that I need to finish (and just plain start!). I have found myself
limiting my projects by what I can do at the computer while medding, and
frankly, it's not as satisfactory. I didn't have a garden this year. Not
just because I'm never in the best of health, but primarily because I
never left the house. Did we have a summer? I can't tell. All I know is
I need more blankets on the bed now.

Yes, if I hadn't been playing with Jak, I'd have stopped logging in.
It's just not as much fun any more. And I was planning my play times
around "whatever you want to do dear" because I stopped caring. That's
not healthy. I'm glad to take a break, and if & when I come back, I am
going to have a better attitude, and schedule when I play.
