Dont test it now. There were hordes of these guys. I had selo+MMdrum and i
made it about 1/2 way before i ran out of life, and I was right against the
zone wall (south one tho). I was able to go through on the north wall
without even tracking any until I got to the HP zone, and then some of these
zombie guards appeared on track to the south east. It seems just the south
zone line is dangerous 7/24.
