Actually, if they were using floating point numbers, you'd likely be 
losing a lot more xp than just that 1.  The number of significant digits 
stored for floating point numbers is not very large.  As I recall, for a 
4 byte float, it's on the order of 6 or 7 significant digits.  For an 8 
byte float, it's more than double that as I recall, so you'd probably be 
ok there.  I would guess that they are indeed using integers as well 
however, the difference in processing is quite significant.
