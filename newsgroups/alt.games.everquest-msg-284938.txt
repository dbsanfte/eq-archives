Its ZEM is still the same, however, since it isn't actually a Hot Zone, 
you can get better exp per hour elsewhere; in Swamp of No Hope and 
Overthere, at Paladul Levels.  Doubling a 100 ZEM makes a 200 ZEM, which 
mocks Paladul's paltry 160 ZEM.

I don't think thats the real reason the place is deserted though.  After 
all, a lot of people really don't understand exp or ZEMs or Hot Zones or 
any of that claptrap; they learned somehow, by hook or by crook, that 
the PC exp was great, so thats where they go, even if there happens to 
be better at the moment.

You could have seen that effect at work when looking at Lake of Ill Omen 
on the Combine or Sleeper server after we opened Kunark; once upon a 
time this was one of the 150 ZEM zones, but it got sliced down to a 
=worst of game= 65 ZEM.  Nonetheless, people came running there from all 
over the old world, and brand new Iksar started their carreers there 
despite being equally close to SONH.  Why?  Because when these people 
last played lowbies in Kunark, LOIO was the bomb, the PC of its day!

Why then, despite long memories, are the Paladul Caverns nearly 
deserted?  Likely because there are few lowbies of any stripe on your 
server, other than bazaar mules.  The lowest level ones are in 
Gloomingdeep, which is a fast and easy and profitable way to get to 
level 10 or so, and which concentrates most new people into a single 
zone so there's chance of getting a group.  After that, they disperse, 
and many of them are doing their newbie armor quests, which means they 
are working in very specific areas till they hit 20 or so.  How many are 
still playing by that point?  In the couple weeks before Combine opened, 
I played several characters to 10 and 20 trying to figure out what to 
play when starting over, there.  And I saw about 20 other people my 
level actively playing, with that number dropping as I climbed in level.

When Combine opened, I'll wager half the people who would have started 
alts on each regular server went instead to Combine or Sleeper.  If I'm 
right, that means you're looking at 10 people or so actively playing at 
your level by the time you get to Paladul Bandit Camp levels.  Put half 
of those in SONH and Overthere, and you're trying to bump into one of 
the five remaining players... good luck with that!
