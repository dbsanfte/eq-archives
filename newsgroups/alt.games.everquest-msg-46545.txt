Just wondering, has anyone tried Iksar yet? If so, are they KOS to everyone
like in the normal servers, or are they just not understood.
Also, can you train languages with level up points (I like playing
enchanters, but they will suck if you Look like a Gnome, but talk like an
elf.)
One more, has anyone made Erudite characters up, and can the dark Erudites
make it through Qeynos?

Thanks in advance for your information
