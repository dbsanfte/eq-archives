Having taken a Vah Shir beastlord to 53 [so far], at least 75% of that being
solo, I'm qualified to comment on this. The above is widely believed and has
some truth to it but in my experience is significantly overstated.

I didn't find 34-38 especially difficult at all. As for the 40s, I soloed in
Rathe until 46, collecting mucho loot and decent experience; the slowdown is
more like 46-48 not 44-48. And even so it never got as difficult for me as I
had been told it would, certainly not "miserable."

Meanwhile I have found the beastlord to be an outstanding solo class most of
the rest of the time. More than once I have thought that the class is almost
_too_ easy to solo, that beastlords might be primed for some nerfage in the
name of game balance. Right now I am merrily soloing in Dulak at 53, am
about to go shopping with my latest pile of 7,000pp, and 54 is a big spell
level including a new pet...and we even have an excellent class site with
rich, thorough discussion forums (www.eqbeastlord.com).
Highly recommended.
