>what are you hiding if you don't want people to see what you are wearing?

My secret plans for world domination.

>Inspecting someone is exactly what you do everytime you look at someone IRL.

Every time I look at someone RL, I do not examine their rings, earrings,
belt, nor do I pull up the collar of their shirt to look for the brand
label.

Looking at someone in EQ without inspecting is what you do to people RL.

Well, good for you.

How can you possibily figure this? Take a shaman and a warrior...they both
are dressed up in their stylish matching gear...a suit of full cobalt, and
a suit of full jaundiced bone. You admire them. You oogle their le3tn3sS.
Then you inspect them, cause they went through all that effort...

The armor in the inventory window is identical on both characters. Armor is
incredibly boring to look at in the inventory window...if someone is
collecting a suit to look good externally, then by inspecting them and
blocking the view with the inventory window, then you are in fact going
exactly contrary to that person's wishes.

Or, you could go to Allakhazam and look at the fashion tables. 

Personally, I don't want interest from people who feel the need to look at
my fear, and I don't want their recognition for anything I do, because it
invariably means they are going to try and beg from me. When I am in EC, I
take off all my visible equipment...I get no inspects, and that suits me
just fine.
