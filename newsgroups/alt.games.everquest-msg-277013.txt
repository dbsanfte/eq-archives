Hm, I thought that most tailoring could be done equally well in
either a sewing kit or a loom.  (And if it has 9-10 ingredients,
you need a loom, unless you have one of the no-longer-available
Deluxe Sewing Kits.)  And according to the eqtraders.com website
(which IS still fairly up-to-date), there's a loom in Kelethin
at +910, +565.

So yes, you CAN use a sewing kit, but unless you intend to do
enough tailoring to make it worth keeping, you might just want
to use the loom.

Some of the recently added DoN tailoring requires a special
cultural sewing kit, but I don't know all the details.
