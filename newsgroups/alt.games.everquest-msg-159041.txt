I would think so, yeah.

If you can get in invis, the front door route is a lot shorter.
If you're going to fight in, the jail is a longer trip and there
are more mobs in your way, but you'll be able to fight fewer
mobs per fight instead of getting swarmed.  It's hard *not*
to get swarmed fighting in the front door.

The catch is that with few exceptions, every spawn point in Mistmoore
will spawn as a live mob (usually a Dark Elf) if the last time it
was killed it makes it respawn during the day time (8am-8pm gametime, IIRC),
and as an undead mob (usually the white-skinned ladies with bad
posture) if the respawn happens at night.

This means that the mobs in any particular area may often be
a mix of live and undead, making any form of invisibility ineffective
for getting through stealthily.

My advice would be to put up regular invis and try waltzing in the
front door.  But if there's an undead mob or five up and it ruins
that plan, have the Druid lesser-evac you back to the zone line,
then try invising up through the jail route.  If *that* proves
unworkable for the same reason, evac again and then fight your
way slowly and carefully to the ballroom via the jail (at least
until you clear the problematic undead mob(s), then maybe you
can invis the rest of the way in).  Take your time and do it 
right, or you'll find out why this zone has been called 
"Trainmoore".

Once you make it to the Ballroom area by any route, you might
want to try breaking the room the way I did when I was soloing
it with my (then) 50-ish Paladin (and the place was still
quite capable of killing me even then if I pulled badly).

I invised into the hidden "side" hall.  On the www.eqatlas.com
map of Mistmoore, it's the north/south oriented hall that
runs along the west edge of room #11.  Note that both ends
of it are "secret walls", where you have to just walk through
what seems to be a wall to get into/out of the hallway.

This hall will be empty most of the time, except for
only one mob that wanders into here (Mistmoore in
general has few wandering mobs, thank goodness, most are
static).  Wait until it arrives, then kill it.  Then pull
the two (IIRC) mobs from the octagonal room on the north end
of the hall and kill them.

Then move into the octagonal room and clear the mob(s) to
your west -- *all* the way west, clear the "foyer" well.

From that point it's easy to pull the ballroom from both
the northeast and northwest corners as necessary,
eventually carefully pulling the room clean.

Once I cleared the room, I liked to move to the southwest
corner of the Ballroom to wait for respawns, so that I 
wouldn't have to bother with the "foyer" spawns anymore 
(I was only there to try for the named mobs which spawn 
inside the ballroom itself, I presume you are too).

If you're looking for the named mobs which drop the Bard
instruments and other quest items, note that they can't
spawn at night (undead placeholders pop then), so you'll
be more effective if you start noting the number of game-hours
it takes for the mobs to respawn after they're killed,
and then not kill each spawn as soon as it arrives if the
subsequent respawn would occur at night (game-time).  Instead,
wait around and only kill them off when the subsequent respawn
will occur during daytime, game-wise.

That seems like a decent group, actually.  Warrior for melee,
Bard for melee and/or chant/DoT songs, Mage pet for more melee,
Mage for nukes, Enchanter to feed mana and Slow/Haste/Crowd-control,
Druid for damage shields, back-up heals, snares, DoTs/nukes, and evacs
if necessary, and the Cleric to keep everyone healthy (or rez
the fallen).

To tell the truth, that sounds like an almost ideal Mistmoore group.
