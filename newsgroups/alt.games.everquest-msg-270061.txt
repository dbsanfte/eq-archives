I am sorry to hear about you problem. I have started 4 characters my
main and 3 alts in EQ 2 and have gotten in GREAT groups on the island
for the orc quest and many other quest there that require more than one
person. I have been very very impressed with the grouping in this one
as aposed to the first one where people only wanted certain classes in
groups and if you wern't one well go f your self. Anyways hope it gets
better for you.
