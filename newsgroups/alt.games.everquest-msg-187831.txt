    Well, even if the HG's health bar is full, it's walking AWAY slowly from
a shadow knight and a skeleton who are obviously within its agro range. You
want to tell me I should believe someone who thinks casting on that HG
wasn't KSing? And when it doesn't turn to even look at them after their
first cast, they STILL don't notice me?

    I'm not talking about the borderline ones where lag could play a role.
Forgive and forget is my motto there, although sometimes I'm pissed off at
the time, I mean the times when it's VERY obvious somebody has already
cast/already hit a mob and another person comes along and takes it. That's
flagrant KSing - and it becomes even more flagrant when they *fail to
notice* the shadow knight and pet backing away after they root it, and
proceed to nuke it to death (quick kill) instead of DoT it like druids
normally do.

    Yes, a large number of times I've cast on a mob with a full HP bar and
realised that either
    a) his hp bar drops further, more quickly than it should have, at which
point I back away
    b) the mob turns to me but doesn't come at me - ie was already rooted -
once again I back away having effectively donated a 60% snare/ 300 point DoT
to the giant's real owner
    c) that someone had agrod the giant just before I did - once again I
back away and if they don't come back for it /ooc hey come back and get your
giant that was an accident sorry

    Anyone in any of those situations who continues to pound on the mob,
especially if they go all out, race like, to kill the giant as quickly as
possible, is a deliberate KSer, but it's usually too close to call. It's the
very obvious ones that piss me off.

    I've never been accused of KSing in all my time there, and I think that
says a lot. I have a modem link in Australia too which means I make these
mistakes A LOT. But it also means that if *I* can see the giant I'm
chasing's HP bar is down by 25%, everyone else in the zone either has a
300baud modem in uzbekistan or can quite clearly see more HP than that
missing from the giant.

    The really shitful part about KSing in Rathe is that if someone can KS
from me, they're one of the higher level players in the area - it IS rather
difficult to out-damage a fear kiting SK and something you have to TRY to
do. Druids have to nuke to do it, wizards can do it with serious nukage -
but this means that it's not the kind of players who have trouble finding a
giant in the first place who are doing it - it's people who are constantly
killing giants and having little or no issue taking them down that decide
they've got the right to take them off me. Once again, not talking about
marginal circumstances but times when it's obvious I had already cast on a
giant and / or had already damaged it.

Regards,
James
