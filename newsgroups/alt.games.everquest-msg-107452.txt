Don't ever ever target me and click invite without talking to me first.

This goes double if I don't have LFG on.

A guildmate asked me to come to KC and help him work on his monk
pipe drop.

I ran into the zone, looked around for him briefly, and got an invite.
Naturally I hit follow, thinking this was my buddy's group leader.
Three people in the group, none of them him.  I say "hmm, this doesn't
look right, did you call me?"  Leader says yes.  OK, so it -could- be
that my monkey has crashed out or been forced to /q out from under a
mob somewhere.... when I get an invite to join from him!

OK, so I disband, tell him to reinvite, and off we go.

I know, its minor.  But they didn't ask me, and it bugs me when
people do that.  Then they lied and said they had.

They invited me a few more times, and several times asked
for heals and even a rez.  Now I'm really one of the more generous
clerics you'll see walking the face of Norrath, giving not only heals
but buffs on top of that most of the time when someone is in need...
but nothing for these guys, not a chance.

Felt good issuing the cold shoulder there, really did.
