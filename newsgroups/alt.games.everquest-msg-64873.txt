Same thing happened to me once, a reboot cured it.

It happened after I had to CTL ALT DEL out of EQ the first time when
ZoneAlarm kept on trying to give me the "do you want eqgame to connect
to the internet" popup even though I'd told it "Yes" before and to
remember it. :P

It only happened that once which is nice....I've gotten used to not
having to reboot before every EQ session like I did with Win98. :)
