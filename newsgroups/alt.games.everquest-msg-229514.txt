Ever notice that when they take mitagation away from a class its in
HUGE bites but when they increase it theres only a small difference.
Monks were hit with 10-20% mitagation nerf (depending on equipment and
whos figgures you like) while war get less than 5 back. Ok SoE fork
over the rest....or even return the stolen property perhaps?
