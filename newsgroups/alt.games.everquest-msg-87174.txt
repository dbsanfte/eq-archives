Yeah, it's called "The curse of AB"... Basically, take the price on
yer average server, and halve it. Then you might be looking at the
top-end of the AB price scale.

Hehe, I wasn't looking for a good deal, I had 2.5k burning a hole in
my pocket, and wanted a Lammy NOW. I tried offering a lower price, of
course, but he came right back with 2.5

And I advertise with low prices, I hate EC, and want to get out of
there ASAP, so I can go have fun with my friends.
