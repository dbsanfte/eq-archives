I liked EQ2 but the stupid decision of having an access quest to
everywhere (and I mean *everywhere*) after 20 just killed it for me.
Well, that and the fact that all my guild partners left the game for RL
issues and I was always playing alone, so I set my goal to get a horse,
managed to buy it in like 2 weeks, and then was back in having to do
access quests to go wherever I wanted, so I said screw it.
Trying WoW now, it's fun but too group unfriendly to me, I just wish
fights lasted twice as much, as it is, by the time I cast my first
spell the mob is already dead (if you have more than 2 people in the
group)
