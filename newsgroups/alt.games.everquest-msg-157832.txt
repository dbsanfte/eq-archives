Apparently it's still incredibly buggy. Saw one account on our server of
folks using it in the manner you describe and winding up having to camp
out the entire raid and reform because everyone (PoP enabled or not) was
group/raid bugged.

Speculation being (and I tend to agree) that things like conversation
channels, grouping, etc. are embedded so firmly into the code that it's
hard to shut them off or filter them.  However, Sony has attempted to
lock this feature away from any player not willing to pony up the thirty
bucks for PoP.

Problem is, people are still getting sort of invited into raid groups
without it. The bug, in this case, (or so I suspect) is that the non-PoP
enabled folks can be invited at all. Then, when anything disturbing to
the group/raid structure happens, it falls apart.

If we can get a raid of only PoP enabled folks going soon, we can test
it out and have some /quit and LD situations and see how the Raid code
reacts.

All of this will be moot in a month or two anyway, I suspect, because
once PoP sales hit some designated saturation point, Sony will suddenly
"see the light" and make it avaialable to everyone anyway, just like
with the Velious stuff.
