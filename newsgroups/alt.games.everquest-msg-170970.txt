I agree.  I cannot recall a single instance of having my buffs stripped
zoning that I was not on at least one mob's hate list.  Usually there
have been several, all beating on me, but once in a while I've hit the
zone <way> ahead of the posse and still been stripped (lesson learned:
if you've got the time and the ability, hit yourself with a heal just
before you zone).  Also, I can only recall one instance where I was at
more than about 10% and this happened, and in that case the char had
buffs that nearly doubled his HP and was at just about 20% when he
zoned.  So I think the game is quite aware of both your "normal" HP and
you current HP when it decides whether to strip you.  I do suspect that
the cases where you are stripped <and> appear at the "safe spot" (succor
loc) occur when you "died but not really", i.e. the server decides that
the kill-shot occurred after you had hit the zone line.
