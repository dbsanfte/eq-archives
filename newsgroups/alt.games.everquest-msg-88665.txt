Can imagine since they seem to be rarer than gold bars lying on the
street :) still not high enough to take on the elites and commanders
with some kind of safety.

Rogues are fun but as you said some skills will be low because you
don't get hit, think my mage will suffer that to, nuke mob to pull,
send pet, rain mob or nuke, maybe heal pet then mob dies, i can hardly
hit a barn from inside and that is bad, will go fight on fallen iksar
island in TD now though and that should get my defense/offense skill
up fast, them skeletons hit way much :)
