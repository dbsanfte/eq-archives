I'm 99% sure that Kedge was in the game from the start (as was I), it was
just ignored by everyone for quite a while.  Ignored by Verant and not
itemized, and ignored by players BECAUSE it wasn't itemized.  That's the
main reason, though I guess pathing was a small part.  What uberguild
(mostly level 35+) wants to go to a zone that doesn't drop ph4t l3wt?
Itemization still sucks there, but the zone isn't useless.
