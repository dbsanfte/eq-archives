 Certain race/class combos are. I know some agnostic human monks are not
kos there. As for your particular combination though, the easiest thing
to do is go over there and con the big golem at the gate. Easy enough to
target. Also, if you're taking the boat through TD, con the ogres there.
Just be sure to con them while not on the boat, since you'll be
indifferent while on it.

 If you're in good with VenrilSathir you'll be in good with the goons,
regardless of race. They are on the same faction.
