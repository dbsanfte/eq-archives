Yep, it takes it directly out of the mob's loot so the group doesn't
get it.

Method #1: be main looter for your group. then you can PP away like a
madman and it just goes into the general pool that you'd split anyway.

Method #2: ask your group if they mind if you PP, and offer to split the
take with them. In pickup groups with strangers, I'll actually mark down
every cp I get and when I max out the skill for the level, I'll split the
results with everyone in the group. It's more of a pain for the non-cash
loot, I'll admit. I definitely prefer #1.

Asking first is definitely better in any event. Occasionally the mobs will
notice you pickpocketing and will announce to everyone in earshot (ie,
your group) that you are a thief. Groupmates who weren't told you were
pickpocketing tend to get very grumpy at this; groupmates who were told
beforehand will find major amusement at your chagrin.
