So, you're accepting the blame then?

That'd be quite a stretch to infer, hardly reasonable for you to
claim that it was implied.  There is no reason for anybody reading
your first post to infer, let alone accept, the idea that kiting
constitues "better tactics" in a generic and universal sense.

This is the FIRST mention you've made of "off for a new one".  In fact,
you stated that you wanted him to tank when an HG broke root, which he
couldn't very well do if he was off looking for another to pull.  Looks
to me as if you're making this shit up as you go along.  You're too
damned lazy to figure out how to work effectively as a group and trying
to claim that the result was entirely somebody else's fault.

Your platitudes do indeed appear to be easy to spout.  Sadly, they're
not particularly useful.

I can just imagine how you presented your advice.  Somehow I doubt
that it was couched in terms likely to receive a favorable response.

If your approach to educating a team member has the same clarity as
your posts in this thread, in effect asserting "hey I'm bitchy, if
you're not clairvoyant you'd best hit the highway because I sure as
hell won't give you useful direction", I'm betting you don't have a
whole lot of success with it.
