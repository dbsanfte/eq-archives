Correct.  HIDE won't work on any once you're on the hate list, but a
successful sneak is 100% effective on every mob in the game.  Not
only that, but if you're pulling a single mob, you don't even have to sneak
to get through the other mobs on the path back until you get right to them.
This is handy pre-55 when sneak is still slower, but is REALLy fun and
useful at levels 58-60 when you can't really tell much difference between
sneak speed and regular speed.

Sneak pulling was how I learned to solo the lizard sentinals from the
maze in Cazic back when rogues didn't get groups in Cazic (pick-ups,
anyways) without pulling back green warders and defenders.
