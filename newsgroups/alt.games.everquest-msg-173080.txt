  Problem is, that some of us see ALL replies as feeding the
flames of this moronic drivel.  Anything you post in reply is
moronic drivel by defination.  You're adding to the noise ratio
on this newsgroup and several others.   Not saying that you can't
do this, of course, but don't be surrised when you find yourself
on  a bunch of killfiles.

    Me, I made my VERY first entry in my killfile for End Times
Prophet, ignoring any thread he starts.  I'm alot happier that I
did.
