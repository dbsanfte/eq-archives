I posted that after a bad day so I was overly blunt, sorry. I have become
disillusioned with EQ of late, it seems full of obnoxious net teens all of a
sudden and I tend to disbelieve most things I see on EQ based forums of this

players from way back when and he seemed very young to me...

Like you say, who knows? :)
