No, not the same thing.  It has been going on for 2 or 3 days on EMarr now.
There are Tizmaks all over the place in the general area of Thurgadin.
There are Kodiaks and Wurms that wander from the Wurm cave area to the
spires, and poof at the Nexus Scion.  I have been told that it was caused by
the 10th ring script gone horribly wrong.  Oh, yes, and many of the mobs of
all different types shout something stupid to the zone, I don't recall the
exact text.
