I PL'ed an iksar warrior 1 - 50 in just at 2 days played, 2 weeks after
kunark. He had all weapon skills maxed, defense and offense maxed, kick
maxed, disarm maxed, sense heading maxed (had to throw this in).

He did not have bash/slam (which ever is the skill non-large wars get)
maxed, but not may warriors not of the large variety do.

You can do it if you don't do it stupidly.

I PL'ed my rogue from 18 - 54 and all his skills are maxed except sneak/hide
and those are both 190+. BS was the only one hard, I just would cast
everything that would taunt a mob with my shaman and leave it beating on
him.

Casters are easy as well, but you have the spell casting busy work after
each session so will usually end up with longer played times than you would
with a tank class. Though pet classes can usually keep thier main damage
dealing casting skills up, just use the lowest level spells while buffing
the pet.
