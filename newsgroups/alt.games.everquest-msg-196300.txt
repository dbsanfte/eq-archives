The anticipated greed/rudeness over lowbie quests was a concern of mine
before the server opened.  But I have been pleasantly surprised at how
helpful and reasonable lots of people have been, at least in the Qeynos
area and in the Feerrott.  Of course, my choice of Qeynos for a start
area was based on my experiences in GFay when Lanys opened, and I have
had no difficulty at all believing the not so pleasant things I've
heard from folks who started in GFay, Nektulos, and Misty Thicket.
