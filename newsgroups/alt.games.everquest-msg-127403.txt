While I'm not inimately familiar with the TLC that FV apparantly adheres
to (other than to thank my lucky stars they were talked out of putting
it into effect across all servers for Luclin) I think I see a few ways
around
this.

One) Group.  While a single individual may have trouble taking on the
newbie
log guys from 1 to 3, surely a duo or trio can handle them?  Similarly, a
groups
should be able to take on the stump halflings at a low enough level that
you
can get exp from them... and isn't that the requirement for TLC?

Two) you say they aren't no drop.  Buff up or otherwise help newbies
kill your mobs for  you, they loot and hand over the item you need.  They
get a little PL action and you get your "impossible quandry" drops
for your own use.

Three) find someone higher level to help you out... as with Two above,
its not necessary for them to do the killing, what if they buff you up
so you can succeed, or heal you while you fight, or heck, just go
to stump, kill halflings one at a time nice and slow, so when repops
start you have plenty of time to pull each one single, and keep at the
job as long as you like.
