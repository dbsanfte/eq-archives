Well it's tuesday now and I received an e-mail from everquest tech support
asking  info about my config and such, I still can't connect :( or change my
billing info for that matter.

Contacted my bank and they said Sony wanted to bill on the old card, which
validation date expired so they refused payment.  Sony says I need to
re-enter the new Credit card info ingame which I tried about a hundred times
now, whithout success... to be continued I fear

Venomia.
