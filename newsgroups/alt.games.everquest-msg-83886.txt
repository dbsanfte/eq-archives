While you don't *need* to know that each flameball (read:  DD & DoT) has
been launched I, as a melee, like to know when a Slow/Root/Snare has been
done, etc.  It's great when the cleric gives a 10-sec warning before a
Complete Heal, etc, or the druid gives a slight warning to get close before
a group-buff (nothing like getting 0 warning when too far away).  The group
does not need to know everytime I do a backstab higher than the warrior's
last crit (happens a lot!) but the group should get told when something is
done to the mob that they all *may* need to know.

Really, the worst I've ever seen was the bard that had a social tied to
EVERY song, in EVERY twist.  So she'd be spamming us with some fruity
phrases every couple of seconds, ad infinitum.
