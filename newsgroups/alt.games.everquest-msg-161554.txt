Hi there,

I was on a guild raid to take the Royals in Chardok over the weekend.
We did this the old-fashioned way - No CoTH, just fighting our way
in.

With a combination of FD pulling, and an AE set-up when needed at
some locations (Enchanters + Wizards == own), we cleared up to and
killed the Prince with no real issues.

We then moved to the Library to take the King, moving over the
trap door to the next room.

Something then went very awry -- basically, the King room decided
to join us, and needless to say we got wiped out very quickly 
indeed.  I cast Evac as soon as I saw the train (it was obvious
that no clerics were going to get to camp), and yet only myself
and a druid survived.

So, any ideas as to what happened?  We had seen bugs throughout the
zone - for example, tanks getting summoned up/downstairs by mobs
at full health, that sort of thing.

No-one fell through the trapdoor as far as I am aware (one person
did earlier, but they just died quite quickly and were rezzed).

Tris.
