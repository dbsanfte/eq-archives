Have the crazed goblins been nerfed again?  When I came online tonight there
were only 2 goblins spawning and the one in front by the tree wandered off
after about a minute and despawned.  The cycle is still about 15 minutes but
with one now wandering and there being only two to begin with this camp is
beginning to become at best tedious.

It can't be that Verant wants to help Pals get the camp for the Ghoulbane
quest for the blade is not dropping that much and with only two gobs
spawning the quest will take longer than ever.  The only possible
explanation for this nerf is that Verant does not want the place camped for
xp and loot.  In short Verant has decided to make level 30s work harder than
ever to level and is offering them less loot than before, since Ill Omen,
Overthere, and Frontier Mountains have already seen their loot severely cut
over the last few months.  This may prove to be a serious mistake, for while
the mobs have become much harder over the last few months players will no
longer be able to afford the armor and weapons they need to keep up with
them and may loose interest in a game that is clearly increasingly balanced
against and made to favor high level twinks who can afford high level armor
and the necessity to gain xp in places that offers little if any loot like
with the Zelniaks on the moon.

I would be very interested in seeing how Verant can or will justify this
change, but do not expect that they will even acknowledge it since in their
arrogance they apparently do not consider their player base worth of any
real consideration.

Now to those of you who will automatically reply that if you don't like the
game leave, let me say that I fully intend to do so once a better game comes
out or Verant takes this game much further down its current path.  As for
now though I can assure you that I will never again buy any Verant or Sony
product except possible Planes of Power assuming there is not a viable
alternative to EQ on the market by the time of its appearance, nor will I
ever again encourage another person to buy or enter into this game.
