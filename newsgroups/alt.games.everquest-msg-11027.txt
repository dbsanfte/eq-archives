1. How is that like AD&D?

2. You do know why it was *NOT* like that from the beginning, don't you?
It is because every other game that has tried unrestricted PvP in a
level-based environment has turned into a completely unenjoyable mess
that players quit in droves until restrictions are put in.

The major open question in MMORPG design is how to restrict PvP so it
won't turn into a mess.  Read the FAQs for games like Shadowbane and
Dark Age of Camelot and notice how much effort is devoted to trying to
make it so PvP is part of the game without it ruining the game.

As far as I can tell, the new EQ PvP system only has one mechanism to
control PvP: if you kill a lot of people, you become an attractive
target to other people who like to kill people.

Will that be enough of a restraint?  If some high level person decides
to camp a newbie zone and kill newbies as they respawn, will other high
levels come in and whack them?  If so, will they do it fast enough to
stop the newbies from quiting the game in frustration?
