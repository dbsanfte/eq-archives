I took a break from my EQ break (patch day on DAoC, so my plan of doing
half of level 41 before work was shot down) and logged into EQ to check
out the changes, and see what prices were like in the Bazaar.  The glowing
thing is kind of nice, but I couldn't figure out how to make it go away once
I found the vendor.  What do you do if you want to find another vendor?

I also now have an urge to rewatch "Donnie Darko", but I'm sure that is just
a coincidence.

I also went and targeted some mobs to see the new targeting indicator, and
didn't see anything.  Anyone else have that not do anything for them?
