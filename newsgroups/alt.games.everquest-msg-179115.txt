What I found is that EQIM does not like passwords that have any letter but
the first one capitolized.  When I emailed Sony about my problem, before I
determined that is what it was, they asked me all sorts of information about
my system, which was obviously not the issue, as EQIM worked just fine when
I changed the password to something else, it just would not work with my
original password that had more than one upper case letter.
