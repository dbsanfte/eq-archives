What I want to know is when did they start letting teenagers be cops?
I passed a cop today, and all I could figure was his Daddy was the
Sheriff, and had let him borrow the car. And the badge. And the gun.

Which ranks right up there with the shock I had the first time I took
a class in which I was older than the instructor. By several years.
Damn kids, don't know their place.
