It isnt every giant from Kael- a duplicate of every mob in Kael steaming
across GD would be unstoppable as I dont think the servers would be able to
handle the amount of players in the zone required to stop it.
In fact even if the servers could handle the strain I cant see how a battle
like that could be won-a couple of hundred Chanters and Bards Charming the
giants and hoping they didnt get killed with hundreds of tanks trying to
protect them everyone sowed and running around like Hell Wizzies nuking down
the weaker giants, Clerics working like mad....If such a thing could ever be
done as nice as the last ring is I  think this sort of accomplishment would
deserve a Hell of a lot more.
Anyway, a group of giants spawn which are quite tough enough, without being
a couple of hundred mobs with numerous 60+ NPCs in there.
