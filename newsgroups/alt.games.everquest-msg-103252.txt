Overclocking just means making it go faster than it was intended to go.
Obviously if it's going faster than the fan that was designed for it, it

HOW you do it...well, I know with my motherboard I can switch a jumper, but
on my video card I've only gotten one that makes it easy (GF2ti) and even
then I wouldn't bother.
