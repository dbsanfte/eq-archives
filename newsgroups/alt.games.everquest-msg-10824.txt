I'm guessing that initially it will be the same old equation of supply vs. demand. If there's
only a couple tailors per server cranking them out initially, the price per AC could be
substantially higher. When the market begins to saturate, I can see if dropping down to
something slightly over the average cost to produce. (maybe 8-10 Plat/AC if the tailor has
them nearly trivial?)
