Hammer is only good for off hand for a rogue, can't Back stab with a hammer
(or 1hs for that matter) I'd suggest better armour, at 50 you could solo the
Goblins in Runnyeye and get Black alloy (not far off Bronze and much
lighter) That would be my first choice, if your not looking to Twink by
buying equipment. As for weapons, yours seem ok, the Bloodclaw will start
proc'ing at 18th...not sure on the SBD...There is no such thing as black
alloy boots so you'll need to look elsewhere for them.
