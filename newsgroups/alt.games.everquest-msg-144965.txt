Why is it generally accepted that rangers can outdamage warriors?  I'm not
talking about trueshot... just normal hacking and slashing.  Are they on a
different damage table, like monks?  That's the only thing I could come up
with, since there does not seem to be any glaringly obvious abilities that
would put them on top, other than casting spells.  I don't see many rangers
nuking, but then again I'm not level 50+.  I also noticed you said this
"particular ranger", and I am not necessarily talking about that specific
ranger, but rangers vs. warriors in general.
