I suspect, however, that the time is gone when the inefficiency of a manual
market would stop professional marketeers. It would not be unreasonable to
assume that IGE make enough to pay some, say, low end chinese wage to work
in an office watching prices, selling peoples gear for a % cut, buying low
and selling high. You might even find the bazaar mechanism entirely
reproduced by paid employees who take a %age of your sale price.

I know people who did this small scale in the days of the commons tunnel
being the played vending location and I dont see that as being an obstacle
to real life profit any more. They have enough capital already to get
bums on chairs doing that sort of work.
