Which analysis indicates that a halfling gets xp 10% faster and gets 50 
points in Hide and 50 points in Sneak, with no disadvantage in the low 
end of the game, and only a slight one at high levels.

Its little wonder all the power gamers pick halflings; I still think SOE 
should bite the bullet and fix the XP bonus; humans should get the extra 
10% instead, as they are the race with the least to reccomend them.

Heh, yep it came close, I got BP and Lammy and filled about half my 
slots with cheap HP gear.

At the sub 10 levels I expected to spend my whole life in?  Yes indeed,

No he doesn't; he ignores his HP bar and keeps killing.  Stop to cast? 
Why?  Regen rate is higher than mob damage rate!  And like any melee at 
this level, dying is faster than sitting around to regen hp/mana, unless 
he has buffs to protect.

I'll admit, though, I was surprised to find that he does have a heal; 
Back when I was last playing a hybrid we got no spells till reaching 
level 9; that 5 point heal at level 1 is a huge change in thinking for 
the low levels.  Sadly you don't get the alteration skill till 9 still, 
so no use sitting around casting the heal on people nearby in order to 
cap out the skill.

Time to regain 800 hp via 5 point heals?  Still think Temp is a big 
deal?  Heck, just regaining the 250 hp from SLN will take 50 casts... 
except that the whole time SLN will be regenning 2 hp a tic, plus it 
will be doing the same while he's not casting heals; 12 hp a minute, all 
the time as long as he's damaged in the slightest.

Another way to look at regen is as a sort of slow; it eliminates roughly 
1 DPS from the mob for every 2 points of regen.  At low levels, mob DPS 
is really very low, especially if you have twink AC levels.  Cut a mob's 
DPS by a third, or in half, and then regen while looking for the next 
mob?  Its pretty sweet.

I was misinformed, thought you had to close the window and then hit 
track in order to get skill ups.  If just hitting track with the window 
open works, then I'm golden; tie to right turn arrow and forget.

I'd also want to tie his left arrow to Forage to get that skill up; I 
hear these days that works better because you can put a bunch of items 
on your cursor before having to dump them.

I doubt I'll work on more than one, unless I end up getting serious 
about him; buying one twink weapon that will last a character into his 
50s is usually pretty easy to do.  Maybe get a 1hb if he gets to dual 
weild, just because off hand DPS won't matter much while his Dual Weild 
skill is low anyway.
