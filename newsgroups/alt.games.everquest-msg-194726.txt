No its highly overblown....note I didnt say its not potentially
dangerous, nor did I say no one died...its reputation is well above the
danger level it presents....and a lot of the danger presented comes from
impatience.

If you keep your eyes open and are prepared to be patient it works....I
used to die sometimes by simply trusting to speed and the wall run...add
a bit of simple caution and awareness and since then I havent yet died
despite taking a wide variety of characters through the zone, ranging
from level 4 or 5 through to 40.

Yes I know...I've seen them.....they run fairly basic paths, and its only
at a few points they come up the wall on anything like a routine fashion,
the worst point is about halfway along where the general floor level rises
in a hill about halfway along the north wall.......if you stay low enough
to aggro general field mobs then you arent being careful enough....the end
of the wall near the Commonlands zone also can get undead  getting close
to the zone edge. Its a matter of knowing where the risk areas are.
EQatlas gives only vague information, certainly enough to make you aware
of what dangers may be there but it doesnt give enough info to really zip
through.

That simply isnt true, Ive sat and watched undead and waited for them
to move out of my way countless times. Are you sure you arent running a
short clip plane?

I have sat many times with my ranger on the zone edge before I learnt how
to use the zone wall at all let alone the patience to navigate it safely
and watched the zone change over......a few pets can get left behind from
pathing problems but basically the zone depops over a period of about one
minutes, and then the daytime widllife comes out to play....Still use the
wall run though unless you need to enter the zone as there are dark elves
who do wander the zone and they are quite tough.....
