Well therin lies another probem.  Shadow Knights and Pallys cannot tank
nearly as well as a Warror.  The Main Healer will be wasting more mana to
keep an over zealous Shadow Knight or Paladin alive than he/she would a
warrior.  This means more downtime for the group due to Healer being OOM.

I see you have a 30 Halfling Warrior.  Have you ever taken a Warrior into
his 50s?
