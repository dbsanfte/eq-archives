I believe the royal fish is on Clerics of Tunare faction, so I would max
that to be safe.

Yes, Kindly should be enough, I only hd amiable when I did it.

As you zone into lake rathe from SK, follow the shore to the right and there
is a little cove.  That's where I got my fish.  Kill all the regular fish
you see, they may be place holders.  Sometimes the fish can also path under
the dock near the SK zone and get stuck.  When you do find the fish, taunt
it, and pull it deep under the water ad root it, then swim to the surface to
break aggro and swim back down to hand in the fish food.  If the princess
spawns too close to the surface, she has been known to poof.

It used to, but that was fixed/nerfed a while back.  Given the relative
simplicity of the quest, the reward is quite nice, 10 AC 10 WIS back slot
item.
