Palindrome  said:
}Nah, I don't mind getting called on, but it has to be someone of your

}someone to dull as to use 'martin' as a nom de usenet) is too crass to
}even post from a real address!

What's wrong with -martin?  Perfickly good name.  Not to mention, a poster 
that frequently has very good information.

I prefer my -martins shaken, not stirred.
