Funny story:

    When I zoned into Gfay, I would always pop up track look for the Priest
of Discord and track him. 1 he's red easy to differentiate between him and
others. 2 has distinctive name. 3. Stands right next to a lift and never
moves. 4 Is always up. This would get me RIGHT to a lift very very quickly.

    One day, I zone into Gfay and I pop up track, and i'm scrolling down it
looking for PoD. He's not on list, I think "well darn somone killed him" but
I keep looking and looking (he respawns fast). Finally I give up and yell
"did somone kill PoD?" answer: "no, he's right where he always is". I'm
totally mystified, why can't i track him. Oh well, I arrive at the lift see
the PoD and pop open track again. As I'm scrolling down I see his name...
and figured out why I couldn't find him... He was Blue. I had leveled up to
52 since I had last been in Gfay, and wasn't expecting him to be blue to
me:)
