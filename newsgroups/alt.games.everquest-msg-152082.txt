With one notable exception (which is kind of a funny story.),  it's a super
tiny camp that is rarely called... only when everything else is taken and
one more group wants to squeeze in, or a low level or two to three person
group camps it.

Seb is super crowded on E'ci.   A group will generally set up in the chef
room, another will set up in the bar room, then they squabble over pulls.
Neither one can really get enough to keep completely busy, but both groups
seem unwilling to leave.

We call Nec Jail the "Gang" camp, for the Gangrenous beetle named, but yes,
this is the division most used on our server.

This would make sense, but the overcrowding means another group will squeeze
into any recognized camp that you're not actually sitting in.

On our server, the exit is often camped.   They pull the golems in there and
wait for trains to kill and a "real" camp to open up.   Don't ask me how
they keep from being bored, I've only camped it once. (Pickup group on my
first trip there ever, at level 52)

It can be broken into two camps on our server, but rarely is.  Nobody camps
the jail really, unless nothing else at all is open. (no named and few
spawns)

Yes.

One will set up where trak spawns, and pull all the juggs they can, reets if
they get to them.

Another will set up at the first few juggs, pull them and some of the
shrooms.

I'm not sure exactly how it is divided up, as it has been permacamped since
the exp changes.  (and nobody used to camp Lair in the past)
