Nope, it's still wrong.  You said there was no animation of the weapon
swinging or the mob flinching.  There is, even in first person view.  The
mob always animates, both attacks and hits.  And your "special" attacks
animateas well.

You were engaging in hyperbole to make the case against DAOC stronger.
While I agree with many of your points, I couldn't let you state information
that was simply factually incorrect.
