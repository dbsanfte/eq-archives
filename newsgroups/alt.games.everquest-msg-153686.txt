I don't think that's the issue... I think Verant did, indeed, foresee that a
few MB wizzies could take down a mob.  What they didn't foresee is how
players would use that - creating the MB teams that would charge huge sums
to take down a loot, or how one MB wizzie can allow a high-level player to
kill-steal a mob.

In short, players used MB in a way to create Customer Service problems for
Verant, and the last thing Verant wants right now is CS problems.  =)  Hence
the recent change to Ragefire as well.

As with any game, 100,000 players are always going to be more inventive than
a few programmers - they will find a way to use what's given to them in a
way the designers never imagined.  Sometimes this is a good thing; sometimes
it is not.
