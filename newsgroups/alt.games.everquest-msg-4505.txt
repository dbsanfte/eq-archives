It's only bad form if you do it without your group's knowledge.  With the
number of alts around, many people I group with don't loot cash at all and
could care less if I pick cash.  Decent loot is magic and can't be picked
anyway.  Just ask your group if anybody objects.  It's also a good idea to
use the /split option to re-distribute *some* of the cash later - that'll
get you a lot of brownie points (reputation counts) and will help rogues
everywhere when we're looking for a group later.
