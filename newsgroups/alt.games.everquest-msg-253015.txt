You've also got to take into consideration that farming for casters is a lot
different from farming for melees.  Melees, such as my rogue, have to
actually do something rather than snare pull, root, and let the dots kill
while we med.  We don't get a four hour health regeneration comprable to
KEI.  I had posted the idea of camping shadowmen for people who don't have a
caster toon.  I wouldn't call it brainless, but there's definately little
danger to it.  Dying while farming Bazaar items would seem brainless.

I'll definately concede that rockhopper hides is more profitable.  I moved
to that with my necromancer.
