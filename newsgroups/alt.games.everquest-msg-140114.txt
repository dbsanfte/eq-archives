rather unsavory individual proudly proclaimed:

I wish it were true.  The screen actually moves very slowly, not the
access to the disk.  If I grab a window and drag it, it's like it's
going through molasses.  Tried W95,98 and now XP and doesn't make a
difference. Also just selecting "refresh" in a window is very slow.  I
have plenty of memory (100mb, upped from 64mb) and it doesn't make any
difference.  I checked the swap file and it's not even being used.  So
I'm pretty sure its the screen and/or the video driver that slowing it
down but I've tried a couple of video drivers and haven't seen any
difference.

Anyone have a Toshiba Satellite 500 that's noticed this?
