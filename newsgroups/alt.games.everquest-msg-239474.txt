STA until you can't put anymore in it. Put the rest(if any) in dex.

When you start choosing gear, work on HP, then AC, then dex. HP(and 
therefore STA) will be *very* important to you as a puller, especially 
after the infamous Monk Damage Mitigation Nerf. Dex will eventually help 
your proc rates, which will help your DPS more than str will.
