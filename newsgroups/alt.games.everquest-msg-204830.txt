> Many mages have reported their firepet being eaten by Rak now.

I happened to have done Rak yesterday with my mage.  Though the time BEFORE
(a few months back) he was chewed up and spit out quite easily, with my
mage's level 58 fire pet (previous was the 49 pet) he wasn't affected (or
some healer was really on his/her toes, which wasn't likely yesterday).
