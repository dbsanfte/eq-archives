First of all... iirc there are 25 servers left, not 21. I counted a few 
weeks ago.

Second 2000 subscribers per server is ludicrously low. A server can 
easily support 10-20000 subscribers.

Very few people play eq 24 hours per day. Many play once a week. :) 

Anyhow a reasonably respected site charting mmorpg subscription rates 
shows this:

http://www.mmogchart.com/Chart2.html

EQ at ~475,000, EQ2 at ~250,000.

Have a gander at the site:

www.mmogchart.com

He provides some good commentary in the analysis and conclusions.

And don't forget to look at the Subscribers 120k+ to give you an visual 
idea of the magnitude of difference between the WoW and EQ2 phenomena. 
WoW is truly wow!
