   This is part of the "shredded arm quest", isn't it?  
The one that gives the reward of Massive Blood Loss? I
believe that its meant to be done by the Idiot class, 
which I try not to play too often.

   This was one of my screening questions to Lenny. Do
you use drugs?  Are you racist?  Are you going to put 
up any resistance to my having a couple of pet cats?
Do you expect me to squeeze out baby after baby while
you spend you evenings in the local bar getting drunk
and blowing cash on the local crack-whores?
