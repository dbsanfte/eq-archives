So far I have completed Lesser Faydark, Nek Forest, Lavastorm, and
Butcherblock. Nek Forest seems pretty boring, and you can only pick
fairy rangers to play (can you say ironic?). Butcherblock is very very
easy to complete. Lavastorm is the most fun, by far, of the ones I have
completed as of yet. Lesser Faydark mission needs to be seriously
redesigned, because at this time it is a nightmare to pull, and hunt
with no mez, lull, invis, or a snare worth speaking of. Complete this
one once if you are like me and just wanted to say you did, and then
never return to it again.. I know I wont. I found monster mission NPCs
at the following spots.. Nek Forest mission, on river bank. Lavastorm
mission, just to the west of the entrance of the evil DoN caves. Lesser
Faydark, just out from the Greater Faydark zone line. Butcherblock, run
to the docks, run out onto the end of the dock, turn 90 degrees to your
right, and run to the land in front of ya, that should get ya to the
NPC. Enjoy
