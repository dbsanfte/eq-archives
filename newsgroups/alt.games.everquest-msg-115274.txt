Well, clerics CAN efficiently solo undead, and they also have
one MAJOR advantage over a rogue soloing...root/gate.

Rogues CAN solo, but only with really top end equipment
and, to be honest, some type of regen item.  My main rogue
back pre-kunark could sneak pull proper-level mobs out of
the maze in CT at level 30, and solo, but then sit for 5 minutes...
this wasn't really a problem, because I would often do work
on the second computer while sitting and healing (unlike
a warrior, which can often tank well enough to just bandage
to half and kill another low blue...if a rogue doesn't START
at full health soloing, he soon will be at full health as well
as naked at his bind point).

My 52 rogue with her epic can barely solo now, and that's
with AC/HPS around 1025/2000...and she wouldn't even
try it if she didn't have a Mrylokar BP (mana-free 90 pt heal
every 6 seconds during downtime).   She could ALWAYS
kill a blue mob, but it would get her down to a bubble or so
and even bandaging to half it's just not "efficient" to solo
that way.

Rogues can solo, it's just generally NOT worth it...as well as
not good for getting backstab skill up (hence the level 40
rogue in a Fungi that misses every backstab with a skill of
42 or so).  Not only is downtime horendous, but they also
can't get away from a bad situation a'la gate or FD.  And dying
while solo can lead to a rez-less death, which just wiped out
a good 6 hour play session's exp.

Don't do it.  Make some friends :-).
