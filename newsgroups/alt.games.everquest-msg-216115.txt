I suggested you should have used the pacify from back before it was changed
and made more useful many months ago in a dungeon that got released a couple
weeks ago?

I'm pretty sure you're confused.  The other option is stupid, but I'm giving
the benefit of the doubt.  :)

And I will basically never say "instead of having a monk pull".  Ever.  Even
with pacifying I'd rather be the one that does the actual pull, because I get
second chances.

When I'm condescending, it's always appropriate (or amusing, which is a good
enough excuse for me).
