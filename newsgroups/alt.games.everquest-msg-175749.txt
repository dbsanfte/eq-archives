Oh!  I'd completely forgotten the befuddlement that choosing a server
causes.  Thanks so much for the advice.  :)
And thank you very much for the welcome.  :)   At the risk of sounding
dumb, what's a "Plonk"?

|
| Feel out a couple different servers before deciding on a permanent
home.  I
| messed around on Vazaelle for about 4-5 months, as my friends were
playing
| there and hailed it as the greatest server in all Sonyland.  Sadly
mistaken
| they were, I was constantly KS'd, begged from, hassled for buffs,
ports, and
| anything else I could possibly give for free.  At first I did it all
the
| time, then I noticed a pattern ... everyone else was gaining levels,
money,
| groups ... I was still the same level with NO xp gain in 3 weeks.  I
retired
| my druid at 42nd level, and started a warrior thinking .. "Heh! beg
buffs,
| ports, and healing from me now!!" And STILL constant begging, and
| harrassment.  I am, of course, making it seem like a bad server for
| mid-levels, but I cannot honestly recall having any fun on there after
I hit
| 39th lvl ... there were a few other servers like that as well.
|
| My personal favorites are: E'Ci, Bristlebane, The Rathe(these people
are
| just TO nice to believe).
|
| E'Ci = hardly any lower levels ... this is my 'soloing' character
server.
|
| Bristlebane - lots of low, mid, high levels everywhere, people are
generally
| very nice to newbies IF asking properly for help.
|
| The Rathe = omg! The people I came across in my toons life on this
server
| are like Mary Poppins.  VERY willing to help if asked nicely, VERY
friendly,
| I just cant say enough about how nice my time was on this server ...
and I
| only ever made it to 19th lvl!!! lol
|
|
| afaik, these servers are all 'old-school' servers, with alot of
long-time
| players on it .. it is a refreshing thing to see 90% of them
remembering
| that we all came from the same 'click' =)

|
| I hardly ever answer any posts here, but I never ignore any of them
either
| =) Well ... there are a few that have made the Plonk Hall of Fame.
|
| Cheers, and good luck to you on your return :)
