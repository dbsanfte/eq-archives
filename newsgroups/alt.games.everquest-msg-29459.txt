Now granted my view is skewed (I live in a college town), but I see people 
of both genders near that age (maybe a little lower) do totally assinine, 
stupid, life-threatening, 
slapyourhandtoyourheadandsay"Whatthef***weretheythinking!" kind of things.

As long as no one actually DIES, they just laugh it off and say "Oh, I 
guess that wasn't too smart huh?"

And if someone DOES die then the parents are immediately on the phone to 
their lawyer because it just COULDN"T be their son/daughter's fault.
