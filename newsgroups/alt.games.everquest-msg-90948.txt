This has been a bug since November 2001, if I'm correct. I ended up buying a
new graphics card since then. It's sad to see all these patches, but some of
the most popular graphics cards get no love. Soundblaster Live/W2K has some
issues too, and no fixes for that since November 2001.

Furthermore, Verant advertises these 2 cards have 0 issues. Clearly false
advertising to say the least.
