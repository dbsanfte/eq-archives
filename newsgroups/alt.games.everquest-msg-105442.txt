ever read about the process of writing and how to ask a question?
you took a drastic guess and put a question mark behind it. that does
not make it a question ;p

your knowledge of the internet and how it works can be augmented by some
google searches on routers, outages, and high traffic symptoms.
trust me, go read more if you want anyone to take you seriously

no it's too bad for you, really.

shows some common sense, most folks are more than happy to answer

my original post was typed while i was giggling at the mere newbiness of

that's too bad. i hope later in life you learn to examine situations
less personally.
