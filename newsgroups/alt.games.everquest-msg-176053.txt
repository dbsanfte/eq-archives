No. Jesus possess all of the spiritual gifts and lived a perfect sinless
life, was baptized by water, performed miracles, healed people, etc.

I do not possess all the spiritual gifts, but apparently do have
bachelorhood and martyrdom, discernment and prophecy when God wants me to
have them.

I have never been baptized by water, have never performed a miracle on the
scale of walking on water or turning water into wine or turning a single
basket of food into enough food to feed 5000 people.

I am not Jewish, Jesus was Jewish, therefore I cannot be Jesus and do not
want to be Jesus, I am a weasly neurotic drunken toady. Jesus is in heaven
right now and will be returning in 6.94 years to crush the antichrist
utterly with his army of angels and saints.

I am not perfect, have sinned many millions of times.

Like I said, I did not cause the rain to stop I was only led by God to know
what he was doing. I did pray that the rain would stop, I have also prayed
that the water would turn to blood, so perhaps God listens to me now that I
have stood up for him, it says in Rev. 11 that I can cause plagues to occur
as I will, there is one extremely special and interesting plague that I
would like to see occur but I will wait before trying to invoke that one to
see if people decide to change their ways and prostrate themselves before
God.
