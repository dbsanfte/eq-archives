Boy, I cannot agree with this advice more!!  I can't tell you how many times
I got killed when I was trying to '/say' an NPC and forgot/missed the '/' -
the a turned on auto attack, I kick NPC, NPC kills me...

If you choose a caster, learn to play WITHOUT KEI/C3.  You'll be far more
effective, and on the rare occasions you DO get KEI, you'll be an irrestible
force!

Lot's of people share this opinion...  Also, don't name your elf Legggolaas
(or any variant) or any other name from a book or movie.  These names fall
in the same category as 'stupid'.  Also, don't chose a name that is LOOONG:
"Annagottadaveedababy".  If it's too long to type, I'll never send you the
in game equivalent of an IM, because it's too much of a pain to type your
name.  I'll never invite you to a group or respond to your /shout or
/auction because I don't want to try and type/spell that name!

A Twink is different from a newbie who is gifted a really cool sword or
piece of armor.  It is not unusual for a veteran to play with a newbie, to
help them learn the ropes and later make a gift of a nice weapon, armor, or
pile of money.  accept them, thank the veteran, and use them wisely.  When
you're able, pass it on to a newbie of your choosing and your EQ Karma will
be complete!

A Twink is a character who is rolled, logged in for the first time, and by
some arrangement with guild, friend, or the same player's alt, completely
outfitted in extreme gear from level one...  Twinking is seductive, but
Twinks do no learn how to play a class properly - and as their level
increases, they find it more and more difficult to play the game, because it
is no longer "easy"...


> above all, HAVE FUN.

Welcome and have fun!  don't be afraid to /shout for advice or help.
there's almost always someone around to help, if you're a decent in-game
player!
