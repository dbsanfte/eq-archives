It's only relevant in regards to my judging you worth sticking in my kill
file. Had you told me you are a beggar that's where you'd've gone, because
beggars deserve to die, but since homocide is illegal, kill filing will do.
:)  Not that you care, but since you're not a scum beggar, you're saved from
that fate. :P

In asking a newbie whether or not he's actually a newbie I am judging
whether or not they're worthy of some crap I want to give them.  Since I
never give any newbie anything not appropriate to their level + 10 or so, no
twink would give a crap about it but I still prefer judging the person for
myself and not letting THEM make the decision if I'm worth bothering with.

It's my stuff.  I want to give it away.  I'm allowed to ask questions of the
receiver.  If you want to consider that "interogation" with all the negative
connotations, that's up to you, and if I ask you that question in the game,
just say "not interested."
