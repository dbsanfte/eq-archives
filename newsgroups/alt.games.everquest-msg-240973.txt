oh, that is funny shit

when you are charmed, you get that rubber-band effect a lot, and you won't
see your health display properly (you can be an inch from your death and
still read whatever your hp was before the charm)

i guess you got xp because pets can gain a portion of xp - did you notice if
it was full xp (did you have a ui that shows xp?), and did you do all the
damage (seems unlikely, but would gain you full xp, if the system is the
same for npc pet owners) ?


and wow, i didn't know necro-based charm would work against pc's (all
skellies i've seen are war/necro/sk)
