    The last thing I would want is the price off a board. Hopefully, when
doing a price check, I would get 2 or 3 prices from people knowledgeable of
the current price an item is bringing, not the price people have been
auctioning for. Some items may drop several thousand plat in price in just a
few days. In the case of a nerf, the opposite is true. In that case you will
see people taking offers on the pre-nerf versions and a polite tell to the
sellers may get you the amount they sold for, or the amount of any offers
they may have received. Although your idea may meet limited success, I
seriously doubt it would be worth the effort involved. Best of luck to you.
