I've been doing without, but that's because I'm used to doing
without.  Until recently, Temp cost a peridot, so it was
considered polite (if not outright required) to donate to
at least cover the cost, and at levels 40 and below there
was, quite frankly, never really a need for it.  I got it now
and then if I happened to be around for an MGB, plus it would
often be thrown in free of charge by a friendly cleric after a
rez, but that's about it.

Once it became free to cast (except for mana and time, of course),
I still didn't see the need to get Temped, since I knew I could
do fine without it.  But as I've gotten closer to 50, and in
particular as I start looking at the Planes, I begin to think
more about getting it.  And that's as it should be: I have no
problem with higher level content being scaled to expect that
the players will have higher level buffs.  But if I'm just going
to be fighting LBs and low DBs (e.g., farming for tradeskills),
I still won't bother getting any buffs at all, except maybe sow.
(And I have potions for that, if nobody's offering.)

But I agree that there's no dearth of level 20-somethings who
seem to think they need a Temp before it's safe to run through
a newbie zone to their starting city.
