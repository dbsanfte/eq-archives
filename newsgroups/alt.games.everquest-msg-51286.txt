There are a few zones that have a good number of them...  People keep
claiming that "Wisp Isle" (the first stop on the boat from Qeynos to Erudin)
is the best place to go, but it was kinda a let down, in my experience...  I
could be the only one in the zone, but barey get any wisps...

The place I normally go to hunt for wisps is in West Commons...  Large open
area, and -tons- of wisps...
