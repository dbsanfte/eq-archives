yes, this is a whine.  Do not read if you are prone to whining about
whining.

Vah Shir were not allowed to use Fungi tunics to prevent twinking, so they
say.  Many months later, VAh Shir still can not wear a fungi
tunic.  Understandably this irked my vah shir-shaman husband.  We already
owned a fungi from pre-luclin, from his iksar shaman, and we waited and
waited for it to be vah shir wearable...but no.  And we eventually sold
the damned thing.

Well!  Damnable frogloks can wear fungi tunics! Where's verants "no rapid
twinkage" policy now, eh?  And Vah Shir _still_ cannot wear fungi
tunics.  *fume*  Course, if we were still playing my husband would have
torpor by now probably, but still.

(Yes, I'm whining even though I'm not playing.  Do you really care?  I
warned you this was a whining post, so phtphphttt! to you if it offends
you.)
