And, ah, by the way, the game and all its contents are copywrite
SOE... Also, the EULA could carry the weight of a contract, but I
don't beleive its been tested in court yet in current form (That is,
notice on the outside of the package that there are terms of use
contained within. I know that EULAs were tested and failed in a case
where there was no such notice). No *real* injury is needed to
constitute a case for copywrite infringement. They may not be able to
sue for damages, but they can have a cease and desist order issued,
which could lead to further punitive actions if Yantis refuses.
