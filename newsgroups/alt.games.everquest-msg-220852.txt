Only if he is lucky.  It is a large zone.  Sometimes one of the frogs
aren't even up, so you first have to find the named.  (Which will look
like a ghost, frog, dinosaur, skelly, or plant).  The zone is hilly
and tree covered, hindering your line-of-sight.  All of this time the
annoying frogs are chasing you.  The shaman *will* sometimes land a
slow on you.  If you stop to fight, you *will* get adds.  This just
makes the whole process take longer as you will eventually end up
having to kill all these LB of green mobs that are chasing you around
the zone.

Yeah you can get lucky but very few people would do something like
this willingly.  They will find a tracker, hell they will hire a
tracker, before they try to get Sebilis keys without one.
