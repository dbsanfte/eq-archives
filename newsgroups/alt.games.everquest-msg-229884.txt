This generally involves a few groups controlling the surrounding mobs
while the main core of the raid attempts to kill the Behemoth.

At 55 you'll be nothing but lag against Behemoth so I suggest you
offer to be (backup perhaps) healer on one of the crowd control
groups.  The layout of the PoI Factory can be confusing so make sure
you follow whoever in your group knows the way to your crowd control
point - you probably don't want to end up with the main raid.

If the raid is a success then you'll need to be relieved by someone
who already has the flag so you can go hail the projection, again make
sure your group knows you NEED the flag, it's possible they may all
have it already.

Behemoth is pretty much a case of killing him before the AoEs tear
your raid apart; it should be pretty clear within ten seconds whether
or not you're going to win.
