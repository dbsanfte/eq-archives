  That's a great story.  While it's true that spying with an alt is a bit
borderline, other than that I don't think anything you or your guild did was
wrong.  The fact that you "spoiled" a preplanned event is just icing on the
cake and made the victory that much sweeter.  They should have recognized
the inherant risks of packing in close, disarming themselves and getting
drunk in the middle of a guildwar.  They could have postponed the wedding or
given a thought to security, but they didn't, and they paid the price,
falling to your initiative and coordination.  If I were in the guild that
was attacked, I would be complaining to the leaders of my guild for bringing
trying to get you in trouble for simply fighting the war that they agreed
to.

  And if I were you, I'd just be happy that you had your great victory and
be glad that the GM didn't do more than slap you on the wrist. :)
