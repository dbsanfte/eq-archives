Oh yes, that feeling.
Used to do that all the time, leave items on the floor in some out of the
way location. Did it in a room in NFP, logged on my Bard (who's nearly
always in EC) to see a barbarian standing there looking, well, like a
barbarian, I frantically checked the floor, to see the small platinum coin
there, I picked up my money and started breathing again...that was nearly
someones lucky day, that was 5k I'd dropped there.
When it came to exchanging a set of Cobalt guants from my Bard to my
Warrior, I got a friend to help :ï¿½)
