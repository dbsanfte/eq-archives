This is a general problem with MM games.  In a game like AD&D, or a
single player computer RPG, there is generally only one PC party in the
world.  Consider for example an AD&D-like game, using the EQ geography.
Suppose you are in Cabilis, and the rest of your party is waiting in
Everfrost.  You need to meet them, for a Vox raid.  You'd tell the DM
the route you are taking to Everfrost, and he'd roll some dice, and tell
you what happens: "You made it to Overthere safetly, caught the boat
after some tense moments when a wandering Dragoon almost spotted you.
Your journey was uneventful, and you made it all the way to West Karana,
where you stumbled into a Hill Giant".  You fight the HG.  You need to
heal, so you tell the DM.  He rolls some dice and tells you have healed
up.  You say you are resuming running to Everfrost.  The DM rolls again,
and tells you you are there.  Elapses real time from Cabilis to
Everfrost: a couple of minutes.

Now consider the same thing in EQ.  Because there are people in the
world besides your party, they can't let you just skip the tedious
travel steps and the healing steps and the medding steps.
