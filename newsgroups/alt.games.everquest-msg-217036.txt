I'll concede that point, a good pulling enchanter that can keep the
mobs stacked up and ready to kill would definitely be a nice easy
laid-back way to do LDoN.

Heh, a tank agro pulling 3-4 (2-3 is more realistic on your average
pull)) at a time is my preferred method for doing LDoN.

 ... or just have a bard pull if we're feeling lazy <g>.

My groups tend to be thoroughly average, gear wise, and I still prefer
to have almost any class over a chanter (on normal). Almost anyone can
off-tank in LDoN (given a slower) and the few times I've seen a
chanter mez it didn't seem to help much, at least not compared to
having an extra tank or DPS class. 

... then again my perspective is biased by the fact that my groups
always have a shammy.

More relaxing? Yes 
More fun? not for me.
