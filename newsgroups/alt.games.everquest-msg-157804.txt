The two hands operate independently of each other for most all things.
The difference being that the primary will attempt a swing each time the
delay clock resets, but the secondary will only attempt it if a check
for Dual Weild is successfully made at the end of each delay clock
cycle.  So don't worry about one being faster/slower than the other. 

Same goes for double attack. Very, very, very rarely you can get the
infamous "quad" attack at your level. (Or is only possible at 39 or
something? Been so long since my warrior was at those levels I can't
recall.) Anyway, first weapon swings. Second weapon makes a check for
dual weild. If that's successful, it swings. Meanwhile, (and this is
where I get fuzzy on this, but I'm sure someone will correct me if
needed) your check for Double Attack has been made on the primary and it
swings again, if successful. If, by some act of the gods, the secondary
passes a second check for dual weild *and* a double attack check it
fires twice also. 

Whether or not you *hit* with all of them is an entirely different
question. :-)

Well, it's something like that anyway, but don't worry. The long delay
of you wurmy won't affect the performance of your Centi.  I guess the
real question is, if you have your wurmy in the primary, is this the
best choice? Generally (though not always) you'll put the fastest weapon
in the primary hand to maximize damage output. No longer recall the
exact stats on those two weapons to guess further and too lazy to look
them up right now.
