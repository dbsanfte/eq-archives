True, but do those allies make reality claims based on what happens in
the game??

I agree..  However, my own experiences with games such as these and
the people involved with them tend to bear out that the game seems to
bring out the psychotic nature of people.  Psychotic insofar as they
blur the line between what is reality and what is the game.

Give you an example.  A guy I know was mercilessly beaten by another
3-4 guys.

The victim's crime?  In a role-playing game, he had hit on a girl that
was MMOG-married to someone else.

So, he was beaten in reality...

I am not discounting the game per se.  I am discounting those who
appear to have problems with the idea that what happens in the game is
their reality.

Having children in an MMOG does not qualify one for Parent Of The Year
in real life.  When one has child-prodigies in an MMOG, doesn't mean
that it means anything other then one knows how to play a good game...
