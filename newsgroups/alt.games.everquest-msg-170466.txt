This one I seriously agree with.  Even before I knew how to re-map my keys,
it was always one of my highest skills.  Once I learned to bind it to my
forward key, I was golden.  To this day, I can't understand why my roommate
never practiced it, but carried around a compass instead (granted, he's got
a naturally good sense of "place," while I'm eternally lost, SH and /loc are
just there to help me get un-lost).  That changed quickly when he saw how my
UI compass was rock-steady.

Now, if they would only change /loc to correspond to a normal X,Y ordered
pair....
