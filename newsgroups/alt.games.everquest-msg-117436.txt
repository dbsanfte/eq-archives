Yes very low population. I made a monk. Group/solo capable.
If you make a group dependant class be prepared to do lots of group leading.
It is very empty. I have been on a server Fennin. A team server.
A new non split server. And yes now checking out FV.
Been here 2 weeks.

As far as twits go. Every server has them. I made a female monk.
With in hours of creation some lvl 1 chanter was feeling her up several
times.
So I zoned to EC. The chanter followed.
Not wanting to break my vow of silence I went touring. Soon a puma saw
lunch.

Sorry I cannot help on high level guilds. I am just looking myself.
I have met many fun players.

I haven't been to bazaar yet so not really sure where the higher or non-noob
hangout is.
I  have never seen any one in EC tunnel. EC pop is 20's.
From crushbone to Blackburrow very few toons.
I have gotten more drive by heals and buffs than other servers as a newbie.

DON'T Delete the character.
If you KNOW you will not play sell everything and put the plat in the bank.
You can always buy new gear next year if you decide to return.

Deleting is final and leaves no recourse.
If you never play it again why not leave the naked toon with plat in the
bank.
You are paying for the game anyway.
