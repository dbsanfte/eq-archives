The game is largely what you make of it.   If thats your goal, then that is
what the game will be for you.    (This likely applies to CoH as well,
although I haven't played it.)

This would be great, but we're unlikely to ever see it happen, at least not
for a price I was willing to pay.  An individual quest sounds really neat,
as long as you're the person receiving the quest.   If you're one of the
other 20,000 people on the server that is not allowed to do it since someone
else did it first, it doesn't sound quite as appealing.   And hiring enough
content desingers to give every one of those 20,000 people an individual
quest would cost a fortune, leading to a high montly fee for the game.

This would not be great.   What reason do you ever have to kill a vendor,
other than to grief another player or group of players?
