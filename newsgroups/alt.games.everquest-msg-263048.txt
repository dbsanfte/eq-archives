LDON is more like a server managed DKP system than pp, IMO. The results 
are no drop, can't be bought/sold/farmed/ or twinked.

I have no objection to it.

Sure it makes sense, nobody denies that. But not everything that makes 
sense is fun. In the real world I don't quest a Ferrari 550 by forcibly 
wresting it from the heavy gaurd its under at the Ferrari factory, I 
work a compartively tedious job until I have several thousand dollars at 
which point I go buy it. (Or I borrow several thousand, buy it, and then 
work a comparitively tedious job to pay it back.)

It makes perfect sense but its about as fun as watching paint dry. Games 
should be fun. The most efficient way to get an upgrade should be to 
fight / quest for it, not farm green mobs for pp.

The economy in EQ is so skewed that its *far* more effective to farm 
spider silk or pelts or even just plat than it is to actually try to get 
items from mobs, until the point at which upgrades become no drop.

Clearly making everything no drop fixes that problem.

Tradeskills are indeed a problem. I'm leaning towards making the 
tradeskill items no drop. It punishes the gear tradeskiller pretty hard, 
but I can live with that. If you really enjoy tradeskills at least you 
can use the stuff yourself. (And of course, you could still tribute 
them)

Doing 15 LDoNs to get a piece of armour is really no different than 
killing any other spawn 15 times to get a piece of no drop armour. Its 
just a little less random, doesn't tie up a particular spawn point, and 
rewards everyone in the group instead of one person.

I don't see it as a real issue.

The bazaar already eliminated the multi-player interactiveness of the 
economy.

I think that would backfire horribly. It will simply increase the 
scarcity of droppables driving the prices up even higher. So the item 
that sells in the bazaar for 20k will now sell to a merchant for 20k? 
Well... the new bazaar price will be 200k or 2000k.

And high end players will be able to afford those prices because they 
can sell high end items to raise that kind of cash. So they will still 
be able to twink them to their level 5 alts.

Meanwhile newbies will see the million pp items their twinked groupmates 
are wearing and despair... IGE will do quite well under that 
arrangement.
