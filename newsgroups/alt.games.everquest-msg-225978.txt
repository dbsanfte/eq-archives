You mentioned trying to manipulate aggro with 'root aggro'. Why wasn't 
that successful? I've never had any trouble with root aggro.

Your group, of course, does need to understand the tactic, how to 
position themselves, and they need to manage their root-breaking actions 
accordingly. But there is no reason I can see why that should be a real 
obstacle in a good group up around 40th level.

Other tactics change as well.. snare, tash & malo early so if the mob 
breaks root and picks a dress wearer there is time to re-acquire aggro / 
re-root before he gets there. MT saves taunt for root breaks. Time nukes 
to bring mobs health to the run point (since its already snared), and if 
they're really on the ball, organize co-casting root with nukes so that 
the root lands moments after the nukes.

You can't just switch to root-aggro on a dime... but its a powerful 
tactic if the group is clued in to it. And an excellent tactic in 
situations where damage output is being limited by aggro concerns.
