For stun to fail to interrupt the mob has to resist it.  When you're
solo you have to be very careful of caster mobs that buff their MR
(Enchanters and Wizards).  Also, some mobs just have a high MR.  If
you can't land 80% or more of your stuns the mob is probably too
tough for you to solo.

Until very recently (tail-end of L53) I was only using 1H solo against
mobs I knew I could defeat fairly easily, and my purpose was solely to
get skill-ups.  My recent first experience in Sebilis has validated the
time I spent doing that.  At L54 I was getting interrupts on 30-50% of
my Bash attacks, which was sufficient to stretch my mana when fighting
a string of chain casters, and also was very valuable fighting the
occasional Enchanter that had time to buff itself (they'd get their MR
to a level where about 70% of my stuns were resisted, and they like to
mez, can be tough to kill).

Oh, and BTW, it was simply fantastic to actually make a substantial
contribution to a group.  By keeping the casters stunned I prevented
deaths (the Wiz casters can be very deadly), shortened fights (Shaman
love to slow the melees, Enchanters use long duration mez on everybody),
prevented trains (Shaman in particular seemed eager to Gate), and etc.
It was quite a change from being an inadequate damage dealer, or a
barely serviceable backup healer, or a NeedMoreArmorUpgrades(tm) tank.
