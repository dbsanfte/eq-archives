I'm confused by the way they've set it up, though.  You checkout
another website, and they give you a 10 minute warning.  You then
click on a link at FP, and hoe to get a key.  If it's not ready,
though, you just get an ad to subscribe - even if you're already a
member.

And the website responsible, http://eq2vault.ign.com/ is confusing, as
posts marked Sat 23rd, are actually from yesterday, so I've no idea if
I just missed today's batch, or it's a late post from yesterday.

As I said - confusing.

I would buy a key, but if anyone here has a beta slot and they're not
using it...
