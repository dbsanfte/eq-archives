From the shadows, the mysterious Ed Jensen <ejensen@visi.com> (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Nader for 2004?

At least Gore wasn't a puppet, though. I'd rather have a bland, boring
leader with a brain than a spooky, obsessed religious zealot leader
with strings attached.

Honestly, don't you get a weird feeling looking into GWB's eyes? The
feeling that he's not all there? There's a glazed quality to them.
Those speeches he gives are downright eerie, and not because of the
content, because of how he gives them. I haven't seen any real
humanity out of him since that time he insulted the reporter he
disliked while standing too close to the mike.
