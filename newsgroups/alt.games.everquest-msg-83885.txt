If the family is all playing at the same time on separate computers,
then each one has the opportunity to consume just as much of Verant's
resources as you or I or anyone else, and they each need to pay their
fair share of the costs.

What might be nice is a discounted rate for a second person who
shares the same computer as the first. It would have to carry a
restriction that only one be logged in at a time. Why do that
when you can just play different characters on the same account,
you might ask? Because each would have their own Station name
and password, which is a Good Thing, and the ability to upgrade
to a full-price account and play together, without character
transfer fees/hassles, once they get a multi-computer setup.

Given the addictive nature of EQ, I think they would get a lot
of upgrades that way.
