Monk could bind in the ruins in FM, since youve got your FD straight away
(no need to mem it up like casters). Failing that, id bind at overthere,
just inside the wall in the NE corner of the outpost by the sea. Pretty easy
to score a sow for the run through fm, especially if its for a cr. Not much
in fm thats a problem if you have sow.
