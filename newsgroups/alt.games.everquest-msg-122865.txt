Go to the spires in GFay. Target the scion and say "I wish to journey
to Luclin". Put the stone she gives you into your inventory. Wait.
Every 15 minutes, a port fires off carrying everyone between the
spires who has a stone to the Nexus on Luclin. Now, find the Odus
Scion and sit on the pad for a while. If you see a message about the
port to Velious about to leave, step off the pad until it leaves, then
get back on. (You don't want to be in Great Divide at level 15) The
pad will eventually teleport you to Toxx forest. Now go find Paineel
(It's the city gate on the south end of the zone.). Enter Paineel,
then hang a left (don't fall in the hole, your corpse will be
effectively lost forever. There are ways to get it back, but tend to
be a lot of trouble for a level 15). Make sure you come out of the
cave in the "newbie yard" about at the center of the opening as not to
aggro the guards. A bit ahead and to the right, you'll find some
stairs. Down the first flight, there should be a cave opening to the
left. That will be the Warrens entrance.
