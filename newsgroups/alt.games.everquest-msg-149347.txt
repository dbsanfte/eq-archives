Let's review. I stated a very valid point that children are not
legally obligated to be able to play this game. Therefore the fact
that children play this game has nothing to do with having a swear
filter or censoring language. Now all you can do is sit there and
insult me with rude comments that you have no proof over at all. I
suggest you rethink your posting strategy.
