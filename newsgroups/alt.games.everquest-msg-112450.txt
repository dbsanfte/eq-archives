Yes I think it is a graduated scale. You can be as low as ~apprehensive and
still get the belts. If you are ~amiable you can get a cape. They will tell
you cost and materials for an item or refuse to tell you if you don't have
enough faction. I think if you made 14 in the Qeynos area you probably have
high enough faction. I used the quest to raise factions with Karana
residents since you can sell the items for about what they cost to make. The
items are all all and very light so after you finish with them you can hand
them down to a magic user.
