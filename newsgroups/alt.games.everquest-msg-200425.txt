ZEM drop from 145 to 85 puts quite a dent in exp per kill per player for
a two player group, given that the grouping bonus was 2% in the old system
and 20% in the new system. A dent to the tune of 31% if my math is right.

That would seem to conflict this statement on the patch message:
--quote--
Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be decreased
slightly.  However, as long as person is grouped with at least one other, they
will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system.
--endquote--

So, assuming that these "experimental results" are accurate, and assuming
that the patch message isn't a flat out lie, I conclude that they botched
the ZEMs on Test and will be fixing them.

[hoping I don't assume too much]
