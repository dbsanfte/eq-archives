Please please tell me that this is someone's idea of a sick joke.

As a relatively new player, I was put off by the 5th Anniversary
celebrations. I have just about managed to cope with my friends
disappearing to CoH, temporarily I hope. But with this list, I have
to wonder what the point of me playing is, if I'm not going to end up
in a raiding guild.

There's only so many times I can take getting stuck in a door,
crashing every time I try to transport anywhere using a Magus, and
having random lockups in PoK. And they want to fix the frigging Plane
of Time?
