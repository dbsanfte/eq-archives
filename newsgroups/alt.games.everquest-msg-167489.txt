I got lucky and someone had killed the named owlbear in Hollowshade
that drops the claw way back when I was level 15 or so and offered the
loot up to whoever got there first. I managed to track the corpse down
before everyone else. Even against mobs other than sonic wolves, it's
lots better than the wolfbane claws. Stats on the claws (From
EQbeastlords message board. Allakhazam's doesn't have it. :/):

Secondary weapon for a long time was a polished steel ulak. A pair of
these ought to do you well. Slightly better damage ratio (unless
you're up against sonic wolves) and better stats than the wolfbane
claws. Also MUCH easier to get - fairly cheap in the Bazaar. Stats,
from Alla's again:
