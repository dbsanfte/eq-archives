Another big fan here of that series. :)  How could a person not be?

While we're swapping recommendations, there are two female writers I've
been voraciously consuming lately (two at once is a rarity for me).

The first is Robin Hobb...ANYTHING by Robin Hobb, though I recommend the
Assissin Quest series first, then the Liveship series, then her current
one (all about the same folks).  Rarely have I known someone to write
about a character that you want to smack around for being so stupid, but
you still like.

The other is newer, Jacqueline Carey, her series Kushiels Dart, Kushiel's
Chosen, and Kushiel's AVatar.  Never thought I'd rave over a book set in
alternate-universe France where the main character was a courtesan
specializing in getting off on by being hit/cut/tortured...but DAMN
those books are good.  And yes, they are a fantasy series...but they
almost border on historical...almost.  Just read it.  Unless you are
squeamish about mixing blood and sex, but Carey does it really well.
