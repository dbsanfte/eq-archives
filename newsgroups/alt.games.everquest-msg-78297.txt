Unless things ahve changed dramatically since the days I actually bothered
to parse things (and they may have...) Strength affects your carrying capacity
and that is about it. It does affect your max hit, slightly. It doesnt affect
your *average* hit much at all, meaning your actual damage output barely
changes.

In the main, stat bonuses are largely irrelevant until they get very large. One
of my two neckpieces has 13 wis on it which is significant enough that sometimes
I wear it despite only having 7ac, etc. Of course, when I made Suid in april
1999 I had no ieda what stats did what and I buffed her Charisma leaving a base
wisdom of 65. C'est la vie ;)

Honestly, I wouldnt worry overly about anything but ac and haste right now - you
might want to check out the quested stonebrunt mountains quest sash which I
understand should soon be within your level range and provide reasonably nice
haste.

If you're soloing HP/Sta and mana/wis would seem important; heals,
roots, snares, etc can be life or death sometimes ("I just need to
land a frigging snare or I'm DEAD" is not that unusual a situation
for me when I solo. I have relatively nice kit including a fungi
tunic and my epics, but I do push what I can do to see if I can
pull it off, and I dont imagine that principle changes much regardless
of level or equipment - managing to solo Kizdean gix with a combine
longsword and banded is just as nifty as keeping four wolves off
you in WW while you kite a damn rhino around giggling to yourself
at the incoming ice burrower ;) )

Of course, at the end of the day, the game is about fun, not efficiency. If you
LIKE having 200 strength and that pretty blackened alloy armour then do it - the
aim is to enjoy yourself ;)
