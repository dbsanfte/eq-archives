Yes, that happened to me yesterday. I said "I do NOT wish to journey to
Luclin." I'm not sure if I said something wrong or what happened, but I got
no response, no shard appeared on my cursor, and I was ported anyway.

Actually now that I remember it, I was invis (that's right....I realized in
Nexus that being invis was why none of the guards responded to my Hailing
them).  So the lady at the spires shouldn't have given me a shard, but I
ported anyway.
