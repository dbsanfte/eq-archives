It trivials at 68, which you are already beyond.

Things to consider:
Gnomish spirits: rice, spider legs, rat ears, bottle (102)
Halas heater: vodka, spider legs, cask (135)
Hulgarish: 2 vodka, water, fishing bait, cask (155)
Ol' Tunjum's fierce brew: barley, hops, yeast, malt, cask (135)
Tail kicker lager: 2 lizard tail, vinegar, malt, yeast 2 water (no cask
or bottle) (142)

You can find places to buy vodka.
Thank you http://www.eqtraders.com for the recipes.
