A different twist.

A few years ago my friends and I were running through West Karana and all of
us had SoW.  As we were running though certain areas, the ranger pulled away
from us.  The ranger explained that some areas of EQ are considered rough
terrain.  I believe that the fields where that scarecrow thing is at is one
of them and maybe also the some of the hills.  He explained that when you go
through rough terrain that the agility will make a difference.
