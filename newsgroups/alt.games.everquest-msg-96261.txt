I suspect horses was a good idea at the time, but they got themselves in 
to a bit of a problem. Consider what their options were:

a) Make horses affordable. Every mid level & twink in the game rides 
around on one. Game balance is totally hosed. Game is unplayable with 
horse graphics enabled and umpteen twinks riding around the zone. 
Everyone turns off horses graphics. Entire point of horses has disappeared.

b) Make horses ridiculously expensive. Only a few bored, rich high 
levels can afford them. Horse becomes a "status symbol". Some people 
leave horse graphics enabled. Point of horses is questionable but better 
than for a)

I reckon b) was the lesser of two evils but horses are a pretty 
questionable addition for the number of people who'll ever be able to 
use them.
