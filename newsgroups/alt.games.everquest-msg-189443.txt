    I've got a dark elf enchanter with 250 int (buffed) and a geerlok device
(povar sorry), and after many weeks of dicking around, and thousands of
plat, many long hours farming various crap, his smithing is all the way up
to 164.

    Last night he pulled more than 10 combines in a row of fine steel
breastplates without a single skillup, and about two fails. When he finally
gets to 188 smithing, the REAL cost and time sink will begin.

    Find a GM smith, and pay him well, else abandon all hope...
