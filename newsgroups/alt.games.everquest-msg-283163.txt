Does anyone know what the veteran reward is for the second year and what it 
does. i made the mistake of giving the first one to the wrong character and 
don't want to repeat the mistake. I have the following characters on 2 
servers: cleric, warrior, enchanter, druid, beastlord, bard, mage, 
necromancer, shadowknight, shaman, paladin, and wizard. Advice on which 
character to give it to would be greatly appreciated.
