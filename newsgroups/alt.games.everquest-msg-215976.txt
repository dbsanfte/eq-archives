Assuming you have a paladin as well as your cleric and enchanter, I'll grant you
pacify pulling can be worthwhile... again as long as the mob clusters are relatively
small; pacifying costs more mana than harmony, and its single target (well there's a
cleric one thats AE but the radius is pretty tiny; do paladins ever get that one?)

Taking one for the team is nice, but its a lot cheaper for the FD puller to NOT take
one at all, and just waste the time it takes for the mobs to return to their starting
positions than it is to rez (or wait for him to run back) and replace all the buffs on
that paladin.
