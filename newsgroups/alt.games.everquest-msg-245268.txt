I like the hot spot idea. Might push people into some of the empty zones
that are less fashionable. I often see zones like gunthak empty, and paw
never seems to have anyone in it beyond the first door. I feel excited by
this and hope I can get into a group in one of these zones; heck, I'd be
happy if I got into some group that was fighting in a LoY zone.

I bought the expansion after the rush died down, and at my level, it's not
too much fun soloing... mebbe I'm just yellow but solo in a dungeon freaks
me out.
