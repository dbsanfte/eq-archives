Must be something more insidious than that, because I use my XP Pro system
for gaming and I have had no problems.  OTOH:  I usually build my systems
pretty carefully, using pretty mainstream stuff.  I'm sure there's a lot of
gamers that have to have the very latest stuff, and they aren't too
concerned if not all the bugs have been worked out yet.  People who complain
about performance when they are using beta or first generation drivers and
cannot figure out why they are having spurious failures need to catch a
clue.

Cheers,
Eric
