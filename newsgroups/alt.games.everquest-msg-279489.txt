Didn't mean to sound baiting. I meant no offense to any BL's out there. 
I just feel that the beastlord class is perhaps the most over-powered or 
overly useful classes in the game. They took the best things from way 
too many classes and rolled them up into the BL. A reduction in 
effectiveness where those abilities are concerned would be the natural 
balancing tactic, but that didn't happen to enough of a degree in this 
case.

Well, you're making my case for me. ;) More on that in a moment...

I play both a mid-level enchanter and shaman, so I do tend to frequent 
their respective class boards. Though I take a lot of class 
grumbling/envy with a grain of salt, I try to pay attention to any hard 
facts presented. According to them, the beastlord slow has gotten to the 
point where it is only like 5% less effective than the shaman, and 
comparable to that of the enchanter.

I can't speak to the viability of your buffs, but I do know what on the 
raids I've attended, BL buffs are assured to be on the list.

Naturally, I don't consider the BL a primary healer, but do you do it as 
well as a Ranger or Paladin?

That has been the gripe I've heard most. If your backpack only has 6 
slots, why take both a knife and a small pruning saw, when your Swiss 
Army knife has both and only takes up one slot? You may not perform some 
of your abilities *quite* as well as the specialists, but it would seem 
you do it well enough to warrant using that extra group slot for another 
high-DPS class in addition to your own added DPS. It's not that you do 
it better or even as well, it's that you do so much of it well enough.

Not a very big problem in the grand scheme of things. Though I'm 
surprised to hear that you don't see the same benefit from haste items 
as, say, the ranger class. Either way, seems like a more than fair 
trade-off if you ask me, considering the myriad of abilities you 
possess.

I think it all boils down to the fact that the BL can really do it all, 
melee, pet, heal, slow, haste, mana regen, buff, SoW, and do them very 
well. It is the Swiss Army knife of EQ without the drawbacks of 
miniaturization and compactness. The downside seems to be *very* 
minimal. 

I just think they wrapped up way too much functionality into that one 
class. /shrug
