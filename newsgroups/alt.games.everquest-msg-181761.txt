So, you assume that because I play computer games and tabletop RP that
I don't do anything else with my leisure time? One can do these things
without taking them to the extreme that makes one an "ubergeek". 

Besides, I wasn't the one who called bards gay...

That was patheticly desperate of you. Care to try again?

Who's trying to speak for the masses? Pick up Hooked on Phonics and
study up on your reading, put down the acid, then try responding to
what I actually typed rather than what you imagined I typed.

Hint: "....no one I've ever gamed with" isn't "trying to speak for the
masses", jackass. Hit the Bazaar and buy a clue.
