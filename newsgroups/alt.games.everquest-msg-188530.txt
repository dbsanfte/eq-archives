Raising 1H slashing is not useless - once you get dual wield (maybe
you already have it?) using two weapons will often be better than
using a two hander. It's much easier two keep aggro dual wielding, and
finding good one handers is often easier.

Of course it will be a pain to raise them, but 14 is still low enough
that it's not too hard, and you will regret it later if you find a
great one handed weapon but can't use it because your skill is so low.

Buying weapons from NPC vendors is usually a very, very expensive way
to get a better weapon. If you have Shadows of Luclin, try going to
the bazaar and look for 2H slashing weapons there. If you don't try
asking to buy one in the auction channel (/auction). But the bazaar is
really by far the best place to go. The quality of the weapons you can
buy there will be far higher than anything you could get any other
way at your level.
