And less correct grammar and sentence structure. I thought kids in the
UK were better educated then in the US.

You either need fans who can write better or a good editor.

"This game shows off the intricate detail developers put from the
graphics to physics.. "

"Now Twisted Metal Junkies like me will enjoy the game I think."

"Graphics is what make this game an enthralling must buy for XBOX You
can see torpedoes flying by your head with amazing speed. "

"The Sims the brain child of Will Wright and his maxis posse, hailed
as one of the most original games for quiet sometime and it spawned 3
expansion packs and more to come."

"The game has limitless possibilities you can create everything from a
house full of evil slobs. To the perfect family, or you can mix the
too with sexy results and lot's of violence."

Ouch..... ouch...

You can make incomplete sentences, sentences with horrible grammar or
you can mix the two!

Truth be told, all the writing on this site is not horrible. The
reviewers who possibly graduated from highschool should be
proofreading for the rest of them. 

Most of the reviews could be used by an English teacher as class
assignments. She could have the students take the review and rewrite
it correctly,

If the site is truely written by people in junior high, that should be
stated somewhere.
