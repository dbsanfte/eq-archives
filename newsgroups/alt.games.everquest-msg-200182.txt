Methinks some of you missed what I was trying to say . It is a gaming term
from tabletop minature wargames . Was not trying to give its definition in
german more than just super . I WAS trying to give its definition in the
gaming community as it has evolved. The english word uber and its meaning
predate EQ and the first time I saw it was as i cited before :p
