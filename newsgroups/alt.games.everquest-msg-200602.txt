    This is why I'm upset: changing the ZEM isn't rocket science. Change one
number, boom, you're done. Figuring out what that number should be changed
to, based on what that patch message said, isn't tough. I've seen several
people here and on various web boards all reach the same conclusion, and
reach it quickly. Yet somehow, when that number is changed on Test, it turns
into a massive nerf on soloists, and a negligible gain for everyone else.
Call me a conspiracy theorist if you like, but I'd like to believe the
people programming EQ aren't THAT stupid.

    I also look at motive. Is there any specific reason why SOE might want
to nerf PoP solo XP? Yes, there is - the picnic tables in Fire. There's a
place in Fire just outside the Fennin Ro event area called the "picnic
tables". Guards spawn there that are level 70ish, hit for nutty damage, and
have 45 K HPs. But they don't summon.

    Top-end wizards can, given enough time, quad them.

    Quad them to the tune of three-quarters of an AA PER QUAD.

    Guild necromancers can kill them solo for nearly an AA yellow per kill.

    So use SOE-think for a moment. You could change the mobs in that
specific area, make them summon, add spawns so there's no room to kite, give
them twice the HPs or just lower their level so they aren't as good XP. But
then you might make the same mistake somewhere else later, or there might be
another spot that players could use that is similar. It would take forever
to stop this out-of-line XP rate. Unless... you made one change that
resulted in an across-the-board nerf to all solo XP, so no matter what new
place these wizards found it wouldn't be so hot. Takes a lot less of your
valuable programming time to do it that way, no?

    On my server, right now Sebilis is populated by one or two groups that
should be there, one level 65 slummer farming the money bugs in Nec Guard,
and either two people farming The Crypt or two people killing Reet frogs for
the Wood Elf Illusion crown quest item. Not gonna be a whole lot of
displacement if an upper floor AoE group moves in - some, not a lot.
