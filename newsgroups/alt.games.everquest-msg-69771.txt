There is none, you can upgrade to as much ram as your motherboard can
take. Microsoft says the limit for 9x Os(Me, 95, 98) is about 1.3 gig
pretty much I think for it to still run ok.

Very likely if you have a 450 mhz cpu you have a BX motherboard and
probably a limitation to 256 meg dimms, 3 of them so you have a hard
limit of 768 meg ram.
