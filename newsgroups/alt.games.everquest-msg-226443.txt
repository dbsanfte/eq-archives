Congratz! I hit 55 last night so we are still within the 7 level limit of
LDoN. You should come hook up with Lance and I sometime on an LDoN run. We
now have a great core group of 5 that includes:

Splendid One, Mage 54 (that's Lance)
Winterfury, Shaman 55 (that's me)
Summerbreeze, Warrior 50
Darina, Cleric 54
Oromet, Enchanter 55

and we're always looking for a 6th. We usually pick one up and then scare
the hell out of them as the chanter says "Guys, I just learned how to use
mez today, I'll be trying it out" and the Cleric asks me for buffs so she
can tank. Summer loves to ask "How do you use taunt", and so on. They REALLY
freak out when I actually  choose a High Difficulty adventure and then in
response to their bafflement ask "Why, is it really harder"?

Then we get inside and quickly get in high-gear, very professional. This
team is very talented and knows its stuff (I'm the noob, but with
experienced guys like Lance and Oromet around I learn a lot). Winning a High
difficulty adventure is a real rush and I love the effort. Won one yesterday
that paid 22 pts and got me my Anathema spell (great new Curse DoT that does
about 1400 damage over 5 tics) . Also, Lance and I picked up all of the
chest trap spells so if you can get the Bard ones we'll have much better
odds of successfully opening up some chests, something that I find almost no
one ever does.

Hope to see you in game, take care!
