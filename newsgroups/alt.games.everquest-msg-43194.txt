The lore pole can break too, but it does seem rarer occurance than a
normal pole. 


 
I don't see what's so out of line with a quest requiring you to be
roughly level 7-8 to kill the mob that drops the pole, resulting in a +1
int 2hb with horrid delay ratio.  I mean the 1hb staff you can get at
level 4 won't even proc til level 10, heheheh
