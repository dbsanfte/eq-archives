    /agree

    Did find the actual percentage bonuses for each new group member (yes I
did *read* them somewhere so this must be taken with a grain of salt - God
did not hand me the knowledge nor did I get written confirmation from Sony)
and although I didn't memorise them but I remember thinking "hrm that
wouldn't be worth it unless each member increased the group's effective
damage output over time by a lot" and frankly most people don't. Even
untwinked I get better exp soloing without the world's greatest solo class
(SK) than I've ever got in a group. I don't know what it is, but groups seem
like a boat anchor these days and I avoid them.

    Besides if I can solo dark blue mobs, getting a whole group of 6 eqnerds
together should mean we can take down reds with regular monotony...

    Best exp ive found so far is duoing with a shammy... he heals and slows
which means i dont have to fear kite (so my mana goes into nukes which eat
it faster than c3 replaces) and he hastes me and my pet so my dps goes up a
*large* amount, he also adds huge dps with his poison nuke/dot and his
psycho pet, who does as much damage as I used to like 5 levels ago. But that
works better than soloing only because I think it more than doubles the rate
at which mobs bite the dust.

    Having said all that, I better have a point, so I guess I'll say EQ
misses the boat if it's trying to encourage grouping, and needs to up the
bonuses :)

Cheers,
James
