You wanna know why we don't beleive you? Because coming in here and
claming to work for Verant and/or Sony <or insert maker of whatever
game the newsgroup in question is for here> and spewing "incriminating
information" as an "inside source" is such a common troll tactic that
it's downright boring. You've posted nothing that leads us to beleive
anything other than you being so full of shit that it's seeping out
your ears.
