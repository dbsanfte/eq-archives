Yeah, it was useful for that.  Here are the things I used to do with 
mine, from the serious to the amusing, in no particular order.

1. Target someone's pet and repeatedly click my staff.  It would not 
actually cast on the pet as the pet is a friendly target, put it would 
make the spell effect.  It would sometimes greatly puzzle or even scare 
the crap out of someone when their pet suddenly would start erupting 
continuous spell effects. :-)

2. Taunting things.  Target mob, and hit staff 10 or 20 times over the 
course of a couple seconds, and it comes.  This was useful in newbie 
zones if I came across, say, a Warrior in trouble.  I could get the mob 
onto me and keep it there while the newbie killed it, saving the newbie 
without taking his kill away.

3. Pulling.  For example, consider the wyverns in Cobalt Scar.  In 
particular, consider the ones that stand in the little room in the tower 
around the portal back to Skyshrine.  I'd go up there, with a levitation 
spell on.  The stupid things are spaced just far enough apart that my 
snare, which is an AOE snare, only gets one at a time, so I can't do the 
obvious thing of snaring a bunch and running back down the stairs or out 
the window.  So what I would do is cast a stun on one, then step back 
out the window, target another, use the staff, and, while still backing 
up, target another and hit the staff on it, then turn and run.  The stun 
wears off the first, and he joins the other two in chasing me.  I'd 
swing back over the land area, get them bunched up, and then use my 
snare to snare them, and then kite them.  (I have jboots, so can get 
enough distance between me and them to cast the snare).  (Note that I 
bunch them up before snaring.  This is what makes Wizard kiting a bit 
more exciting than Druid kiting.  Wizard snare takes a lot more mana 
than Druid snare, and lasts only about 20% as long, but is AOE.  So, 
unlike Druids, who can snare first, then bunch up the mobs, and snare 
again if for some reason the kite is taking too long, Wizards on a tight 
mana budget only want to cast one snare, so have to do the bunching with 
unsnared mobs).

I'd use the staff for pretty much any situation where I was going to 
kite more than one mob, so I could aggro them on the run.

4. Making big trains.  It was fun to run around West Commons and see how 
many mobs I could get at once.  My record is something like 30.  That 
was quite an amusing screenshot.  I was careful to never take these show 
trains near anyone that they would aggro on.  They were just for fun.
