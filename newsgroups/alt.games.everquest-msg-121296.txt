Unless they have a beta-test group with 1000 users, the product isn't going
to get anything close to a 'real' test on a test server.

Most software developers will tell you that a product doesn't really get
tested until it goes live...  with any complex system, the bugs stay hidden
until the true user base get's ahold of the product.  I would suggest that
there are very few (if any) products that hit the PC/Mac world and never
needed a patch.

I think part of Verant's problem is that they do not differentiate between a
system patch and a system enhancement.  They may also need to fix fewer
things at a time, providing more patches.  makes Roll-backs and bug fixes
cleaner.
