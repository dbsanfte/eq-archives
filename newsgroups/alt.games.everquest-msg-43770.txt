You got off luckier than I, I think. Although, come to think of it, I think 
@homes core routers block TCP port 80 and 25. I could be wrong on that.

The 1700 is the server that got off lucky.

One of my other webservers took >150,000 in 12 hours. I have damn near a 
gig of logs *just* for Nimda activity on that one.

No, I don't. 

I expect you to do whatever you want to do. I was merely offering my 
advice, which you have chosen to ignore.

My advice was, if privacy and security are more important than almond 
mochas, buy a firewall, buy a cheapo box to do it (I run one firewall that 
cost well under 75 bucks to build), or use an existing piece of equipment 
to do it. YMMV.

Very good reason. I had assumed that cable routers were customer-owned.

You ripped someone off ;)
