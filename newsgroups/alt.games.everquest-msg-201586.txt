Ah.  You have learned a valuable leason.  Never assume that guards are your
safety net.  I had this happen in GF.  I was new to the game and tried to
take on a farie.  Thing started beating the crap out of me so I ran to the
Gaurds outside the high elf city.  They just stood there.  I was unable to
make it to zone line inside tunnel and died.

Then one time I was in FV and saw this strange crawler.  Looked like a huge
inch worm in how it moved.  I started hiting it and had to run.  I ran into
the outpost in FV with this thing on my tail and not a single gaurd lifted a
sword to help me.  Luckly I had SOW so I ran back outside of the outpost and
zoned into Lake of Ill Omen.

Your death was not a bug in the game.  It was normal.
