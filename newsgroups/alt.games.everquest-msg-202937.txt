<<<<Thanks!  I've always wanted one.  He's like a drogmor ... I beat the drum

It must be a real high point in your otherwise lowly life.  It's a shame that
you sit around all day hoping that noone will get to be as high level as you. 
You really are quite pathetic.  Maybe these problems with your newsgroup have
prevented you from being able to answer the question but we all know that isn't
true.  It's your pea sized little brain that's doing that.  If you keep trying
you might be able to come up with one measley little reason why me and my group
having KEI adversely afffects your gaming experience.  It'll be a stupid reason
and hold absolutely no validity, but at least you'll have finally come up with
one.
