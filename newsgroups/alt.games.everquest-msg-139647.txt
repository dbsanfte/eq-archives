    No, it comes from watching the Asian guild on my server do exactly this.
Raid a little, spend the rest of your time doing XP in CT. If you sit your
ass down there you will get the drops, and hence the plat. And they also
have very nice AA levels (because they do so damn much XP). I've seen more
Exarchs in their guild than in mine.

    In the Bazaar on Quellious, over the past two weeks (the time period
I've been watching it), I have seen: Mosquito Eye earring, Mushroom Veil,
Black Sapphire Velium necklace, Shadel Bandit Ring, Squallsurge Shawl, Hiero
Cloak, Boots of Flowing Slime, Frozen Orb. Might have been an OotIV, but I
haven't looked for caster shields during that time because my own shield is
end-game. I've also seen Thurg silk multiquests offered before I turned off
public channels, although if your guild can kill in Kael Arena you can get
the Thurg quest stuff and the OotIV as drops.

    That's the point, Jazz. If you're in a guild, you DON'T FARM RATHE
MOUNTAINS. Go straight to the zone you want stuff from, like CT, and camp it
directly. The plat per unit time you'll get by going there far surpasses
what you'd make doing giants. I know you know this, because you're trying to
get your own guild to do it (with the Jungle Spider Fur caps)!

    Sell another drop from CT, or a good drop from some of the mobs that you
can farm with ease (Trak BPs sell well if you get one of the "required
class" ones), and there's your cash.

    If I told you some of the amounts people in my guild blow on what I'd
consider non-essential gear you'd gasp. And we race three other guilds in
the Bazaar to get those items when they come up for sale. Yes, we even
compete in The Bazaar. No rotations there!!

    Leave out people capable of taking down the AoW? On my server you just
excluded four guilds from consideration (five or six if you consider
individual guilds and not alliances). About four HUNDRED people. Not
accounts, people. Now, if you consider these people all capable of doing
something like this, that supports my contention about how many people the
mana cap could affect, doesn't it?

    Plus 1188 MANA? Ok, now I have to check my guild's Magelo profiles to
see how many people break it. ;-)
