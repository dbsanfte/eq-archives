When the Kunark expansion added 51-60, only people with the expansion could
level past 50.

LoY good points:

1. More bank slots.  I'm currently killing the bad guards in Katta.  The
merchats are dubious, so I can't unload the stupid swords the guards drop.
Solution: I stick them in the bank when I get encumbered.

2. Guild Management Tool.  It's nice to see where everyone in the guild is,
and their classes and levels.  We've got a note for all the alts that says
who their main is, which is nice.

3. Cartography.

4. The NPC dialog journal.  It has some annoying points, such as recording
statements by mobs you are fighting, so it fills with a lot of junk if you
leave it enabled, and it is nowhere near as nice as a real quest journal,
like in DAoC or Neverwinter Nights or most other more modern games...but it
beats the heck out of taking notes by hand, especially if you play in the
dark, like I do.

LoY points that could have been good, except the players a dumbasses:

1. The enhanced group tool.  If everyone would use this to find groups, and
find players for groups, it would be very useful.  As it is, too few people
use it to make it useful.

2. Charms.  Nice idea, but there don't seem to be a lot of charms, so this
doesn't seem to be really much of a factor.  (There are some pretty amusing
charms, BTW.  A guildmate has one that gives bonuses if you are in a group
that has 4 or more members of the same class).

LoY points that might excite some people:

1. Playable Frogloks.

2. New spells.  For the most part, these aren't really exciting.

3. New zones.  Haven't explored them yet, but I haven't heard much
excitement about them

4. New creatures.  Same as the new zones.
