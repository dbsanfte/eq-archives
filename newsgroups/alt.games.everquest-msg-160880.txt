Its not that bad. The trilogy sells for $20 these days which includes
Original, Kunark and Velious and should be good enough to decide whether you
want to play the game or not. Luclin sells for 25 and so does PoP so if you
play your cards right you'll be done with 70 bucks. I believe a "gold
version" is planned that will contain the whole shabang, probably for a
market price of any new game around 49,95 or so.

I think PoP was the last expansion anyways before the release of EQ 2 in
October 2003 or so.

Come to think of it, many new games START at 44,95 so its not that bad.
