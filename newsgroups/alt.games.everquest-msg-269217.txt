If you're Mining is 40, then you can harvest Ore and Rock in
Atonica/Commonlands.

If you want Dens then you have to raise Trapping to 40 (good luck with that)

If you want Roots/Plants you have to raise Gathering to 45

If you want Trees you have to raise Foresting to 40.

and of course Fish, Fishing to 40.
