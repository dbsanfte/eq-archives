Having been in a lot of groups where using my water pet is impossible
because of positioning issues I have to ask:  What makes melee characters
think it's a good idea to attack the side of the mob?

Often I'll have my pet setup so he starts directly behind the mob - with
just the tank and the pet on it, the mob doesn't move much.  Many of the
secondary melee I've played with will fight from the side of the mob
(worse, several of them will fight from the same side,) pushing the mob
sideways and rotating the pet to their side.  This removes it's ability
to backstab, loses their DPS during enrage and makes the mob move even 
more.

A few rare melee will fight directly between my pet and the mob, however,
keeping all the push along one axis.  The MT might have to step back 
once or twice, but nothing more.
