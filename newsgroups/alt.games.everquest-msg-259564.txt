Yes, you did.  At this point, here, where you first realized the wolf had 
been rooted at some point, was the time to back off your pet and -ask- him 
if he needed help with it or not.  He's a necro.  Worst case he has to FD, 
he's not in any -real- trouble.

It's only a slight variation on a classic tale.  Oldbie sees newbie 
fighting N+1 spiderlings, and thinks newbie can only handle N, so he 
helps without asking.  Newbie gets upset about KSing, oldbie comes here to 
bitch about how ungrateful newbie was, when oldbie "clearly" saved his 
butt.

And the root moral lesson is, ask first.  Then accidentally train him 
silly, after he says it's ok.  "/tt Are you ok?" is pretty quick and easy 
to type.
