Radeon products having some game problems even with suggested drivers
on eqlive forums. I have WinME and Radeon 7500 and still have no good
solution yet. However, I would like to post known solutions that some
ppl have found on this board.

WinXP:

Option 1:

http://www2.ati.com/drivers/wxp-w2k-radeon-6-13-10-6218-efg.exe

Seems to work for alot of people with XP. If not for you try Option 2.

Option 2:

http://download.ati.com/drivers/partnerproducts/wxp-ref-7-70-020418m-003892c.exe

Step by Step:

1. Download the Above linked driver file
2. Kill the previous Drivers by using 
      "http://www2.ati.com/drivers/cat-uninstaller.exe"
3. Confirm Rebooting ure system when PoP-Up appears
4. Abort Windows XP Installation Routine
5. Browse HDD for the downloaded Exe
6. Execute this file
7. Reboot PC after installing
8. Start Everquest
9. Disable Warning-Window (it just tells u that ure driver are not up
to date)
10. Once ingame:
      a. Set Gamma to every wished percentage
      b. set Far Clip Plane to max 54%
      c. Spell particles etc. on low quality and low density

Option 3:

In EQClient.ini add these lines to the defaut

VerterxShaders=FALSE
HardwareTnL=FALSE

Win2k:

This is the only fix that seems to be posted and working.

WinME:

Best thing I have found for and ME fix was this...

http://mirror.ati.com/support/drivers/winme/winmeradeon4137189.html

If the installer gives you an issue you can override it by going to
Control Panel then System. Then, properties of the display driver -
update driver - pick from list - have disk option - drivers from first
attempt should be stored in "C:/ati/support/WME_RADEON_4_13_7189" for
yor disk location.

Hope this info helps others more then it helped me :(
