Let's just hope you have it set somehow to not even try to interpret HTML.
Otherwise, someone could pepper their post with <blink> tags.  You 
wouldn't want to read a post full of </blink> tags.  It's ugly.  <blink> 
should be banned.  </blink> should be terminated with extreme prejudice.  
<blink> could give some poor, overly-epileptic person a seizure. </blink>.

Ok.  That was mean, but I couldn't resist.  Sorry. :)
