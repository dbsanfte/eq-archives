Anyone else here have a Radeon (I got a Radeon VE), using Rage3d drivers,
have EQ working under DirectX 8? I dont want to bother with ATI's drivers
again, my system crashes every couple mins under those, all versions of
them.
I got their latest (4.13.7199 - 10/19/01) drivers on, all I get is garbled
junk followed by a crash if I try to enter the game... just wondering if
anyone had luck with them
