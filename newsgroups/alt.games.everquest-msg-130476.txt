I think the bonechips quest is still about the easiest, and probably the
fastest way to raise that faction.  I'm not sure what level you are, but if
you can, go to Kurns Tower in field of bone.  Kurns tower is absolutely
without argument the best zone in the entire game to aquire bone chips.
Bring lots of bags :)
