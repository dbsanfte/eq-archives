Me, big time. Started earlier last week, resulted in 3 deaths
of 52+ characters during pulls. 

Went from marginal then to unplayable yesterday, unable to stay
connected for more than a few minutes, then being told that I
had an active character - wait a minute - and not being able to
get back on for an average of 15 minutes. Even then, I would
get disconnected in the final seconds of logging in.

I was wondering if it was finally the dreaded cable modem
phenom.

My topology: Cable Modem -> Netgear router -> 2 beefy machines
that are more than the new minimums -> constant LD.

Sure hope that someone has an idea what this is all about.

Thanks.
