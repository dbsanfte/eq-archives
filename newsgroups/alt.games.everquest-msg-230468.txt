First stat I'd go for would be Dex, to help with those pesky missed notes.
They're like fizzles in normal casting.
Next up, Charisma - essential in making charms, fears, and mezzes stick -
all of which you'll be spending a significant amount of time doing later on
in life.
Plus mana gear is nice late in life, but don't worry about it until your 30s
or so, and even then, it's only really suited for a particular playing
style.
Of course, AC and HP are always nice.
