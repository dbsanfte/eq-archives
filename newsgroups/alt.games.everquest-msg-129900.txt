On this same subject then what would you recommend a level 21 druid use? 
I'm a newbie so it's my first character, I don't have lots of money. I 
realize I'm not out there to melee enemies to death, but for the most part 
I just snare 'em, dot 'em, then panic the animals and beat them to death 
from behind. Right now I'm using a plain Velium Scimitar. What could I use 
that's better and within my obtainability?
