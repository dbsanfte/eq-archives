Well the easiest way to explain this is that some people are idiots :-)

My general attitude to healing is if someone is very low on health and I
have mana, I give a couple of drive by heals regardless of whether I want
something from them or not. The only time I ask for clarity or breeze is
when I am either grouped with a chanter or when I have just sowed or buffed
one. Clarity like SOW is a nice thing to have but you can live without it.
