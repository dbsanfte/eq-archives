Definition of paranoia:

par�a�noi�a (pr-noi)
n.
A psychotic disorder characterized by delusions of persecution with or
without grandeur, often strenuously defended with apparent logic and reason.
Extreme, irrational distrust of others.

And now the definition of persectuion:

per�se�cu�tion (p�rs-kyshn)
n.
The act or practice of persecuting on the basis of race, religion, gender,
sexual orientation, or beliefs that differ from those of the persecutor.
The condition of being persecuted.

And now the definition of being persecuted:

per�se�cute (p�rs-kyt)
tr.v. per�se�cut�ed, per�se�cut�ing, per�se�cutes
To oppress or harass with ill-treatment, especially because of race,
religion, gender, sexual orientation, or beliefs.
To annoy persistently; bother.

We have been persecuted, are being attacked (if I need to provide a
definition for that I will). People have a reasonable desire to defend
themselves.

I assume you are single or young, not using this against you because parents
have a very different viewpoint.

Just wanting you to understand what you are agreeing with.

In 6 months, we obviously won't hear from you...
