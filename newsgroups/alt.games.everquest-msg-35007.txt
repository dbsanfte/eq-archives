Why do people always insist on charging *more* for MQ pelts, especially
bear pelts? Do you think there are a host of tailors out there making
large studded leather for all those Troll and Ogre Druids who must need

The largest single use for MQ pelts is to make leather paddings, so they
are *less* useful than LQ pelts, given they must be skinned to low
quality before use.
