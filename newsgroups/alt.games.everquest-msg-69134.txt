	As you gain levels, the con system breaks down, seriously.

	By the mid to high 40s, blues will no longer mean reasonably difficult
kills; they may mean a messy death.  In the 50s, you really have no way of
telling if you can kill a blue or lower without either trying it or having
talked to someone who has.  (And anything white or higher means instant and
certain death.)
