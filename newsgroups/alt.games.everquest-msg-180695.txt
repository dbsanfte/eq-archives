What's bad about it?  Is it that you object to a L7 being able to "earn"
that much pp?  The reason the padding is worth a lot is that it takes a
L65 very nearly as much time to hunt and manufacture as it takes a L7.
A L65 Monk like the GM smith who has made goods for Kaev could not hunt
and tailor a stack of padding nearly as fast as a L30 Ranger or Druid
could.  Any L65 will "earn" on average far more than 400pp worth of loot
in the time it would take for do-it-yourself padding.  The reason that
the market will bear 20pp or 30pp each for padding is the time it takes.
There is nothing at all broken about this particular aspect of the EQ
economy.  IMO, it's stupid to bitch about the price of padding.  Why is
it wrong for low level characters to get paid by high level smiths for
helping them to short-cut the Leather Padding timesink?  If you object
to the timesink then bitch about that, not about the players finding a
way to work cooperatively to defeat it.  This is a GoodThing(tm) about
the in-game economy, it boggles my mind that people bitch about it.
How can you let such petty jealousy ruin your gaming experience?

Kaev <--- who would be buying padding if half-elf cultural armor existed
