Dangerous places for weddings:

- Veeshan Isle in the Plane of Sky while the Hand of Veeshan is up (if
your invis drops, it wil death touch you immediately)
- The entrance portal of Fear, unbroken
- The first bridge in Karnor's
- Faydedar's spawn point in Timorous Deep (more nervous than dangerous)
- in DL, with all participants in wolf form, when Gorenaire is due to
spawn
