Are you still here?  ;p

I mentioned both EULA and Copyright.  Your reply insisted that either of
those two were in violation.  Remember the IP tracing, finding name, oh
heck, I'll just quote you directly:

"If you have given them a method of determining
who you are I would anticipate your account being rightfully terminated
as posting this information is something you have agreed not to do.  "

This one portion of your entire reply would suggest that anything but
morals.  Dont try to old newsgroup bait and switch friend.  Its old, plus,
there are more people out here that read previous posts, than you may think.

Either way, I dont take this situation personally what-so-ever.  As for
those that wish to be RULES LAWYERS, let them.  You say it will ruin their
experience?  I say, they are going to ruin their experience regardless of
what I post or dont post.

As for this topic, in my mind, its dead.  Though I have just one thing to
show you, because it had me falling out of my seat in pure laughter.

ROFLMAO!  My friend, you only explain how you felt it inhibited a guides
efficiency in the very same reply.  You didnt have to put it in simple
terms, simply because my portion quoted above... oh nevermind... "in case
you weren't able to...."  Hmmmm.  Care to give me a chance to read your
reply before assuming I do or dont understand something. ;p

Just as a future reference.  Either way, you are putting far too much heart
into this entire topic for me.  <shrug>  I have to do things in RL now.  Try
it sometime. :)
