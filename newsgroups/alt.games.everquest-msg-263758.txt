   Clearly I misread this then.

   This to me reads like a request.  Or a polite order.  But it certainly
does sound like you are telling me to do something here.

   Yes, you called me out.  This is what I want above everything.  Good
work!

   If you say so.  I have to admit, when someone tells me not to talk to
someone else they don't approve of, I tend to balk and think of words like
"control freak".  I wonder, if they had their way, would I have to run all
my responses past them to make sure they approve to whom I am replying to? 
I dunno.  I don't know you well enough to even speculate at making a call
like that.  But you sure do seem to know me pretty well.  I am impressed!

   Thank you.

   A couple of quick questions.  Do you consider yourself to be one of
these adults you speak of, and if so, do I really have to learn to talk as
you do?
