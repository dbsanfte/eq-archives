You will get very slightly more exp per kill with the group 5 levels
below you, but you will get a significantly larger number of kills per
given time frame with the group 5 levels above you (assuming the same
mobs in both cases).

Therefore, all other things equal, and assuming a steady supply of
mobs, you will get more experience with the group five levels above
you.
