I know how it is to lose camps to LDing. In some cases it is hard to tell if
someone just left or actually went LD. Since you were talking to him and you
let him know when you are done with it you would tell him, then I would say
report him to the guild master. But do look at it from his perspective.
Anyone can camp at a spawn and come back in and say they went LD, even
though it is hard to do when people do camp for sessions anywhere from 1-10
hours.
