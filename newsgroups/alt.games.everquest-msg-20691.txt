Yeah, I suppose wizards take all the fun out of the game. Tanks wear a mob
down to 70% of its initial HP, and the wizard starts Nuking. Man I hate it
when I don't get to melee for 5 minutes plus on one mob and get a couple
adds just to make things more fun.

The problem with the Wizzy class is that it is really tough to learn how to
play correctly. I managed to get up to 27 buy being the quite guy in the
group that doesn't start the fights, but I'm damn sure I end it, with a bang
no less.
