You know what my single biggest MMORPG wish is now?
I want the inability to ever have anything like 

/played

showing that I spend 120 REAL TIME 24 HOUR days of my life (or many
more in my case ;) ) in a game I play. That is just more than many of
us ever want to face up to. The smart game maker in the future will
not have any such sort of way to get that information. Yeah, it might
be nice still to see what real time day you made the character, but
the played just makes you feel like you wasted too much life.
