In another thread I started, I think it was Bizbee that stated that I should
state the players name when describing idiotic, or just plain asinine
players so as to possible help other people to avoid these rejects.  That
got me thinking.  Now let's take this a little further....

Wouldn't it be nice if:

For low-level offenses (or possibly just even enough petitions that are not
"bannable" but show the player to be a nuisance), instead of just temporary
suspensions and what-not, we could impose "scarlet letters" upon the
reinstated players for a period of time?

Yes, yes!  A *BIG* red letter emblazoned right on their chest that will show
absolutely everyone within visible range that they are a potential "Typhoid
Mary" to the groups welfare.
Imagine:

(T) - puller of enormous trains, possibly intentional
(e) - Bayer
(I) - Inattentive, often AFK in groups
(N) - Ninja looter
(X) - Cleric who doesn't mem, or just doesn't use heal spells.
(O) - Over-nuking caster (frequent rezzes)
(B) - Beggar, from SoW's to loot to buffs to PP.

Well, that's all I can think of with a hangover.  Please add more!

Sean...
