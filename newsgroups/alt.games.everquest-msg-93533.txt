Well, my BST is up to lvl 19 as of tonight.  I can say that at 9 you summon
a base warder of lvl 5, and the buff increases it up to lvl 9.  At lvl 15
the base is lvl 9 with the buff increasing it up to lvl 16.  This is all the
info I know personally.  Hopefully this can help some.  Oh, and I don't
remember the lvl 9 pet buff, but the lvl 16 one can double attack for 18 max
i think.  Also they can bash occasionally.
