	It penalizes you because you can't effectively explore new zones with your
existing character -- you have to go back and level up a new one.

	90% of the players in this game won't sit there and farm greens in the
manner you suggest because it's boring and the rewards are usually not worth
it.  Most of the rest are tailors trying to get pelts or silks or such.  It's
a made-up issue Verant uses to justify a policy that protects their precious
zones from being completely revealed on spoiler sites -- for at least a week,
that is.
