The trilogy and any addons except Scarious (spellings) and Luciln are 
not available in the UK. Ubisoft appear to have forgotten there 
commitment to distributing the game in the UK.

As others have suggested get this months PZ Zone (February edition) this 
gives the basic EQ (No Addons) and a trial of 15 days. Subscribing will 
then allow you to continue playing minus the addons. The basic EQ is 
pretty huge so it may keep you occupied.

One key tip for all people who have just entered is hit the F10 key when 
you are in game, suddenly the world looks much better ;)

I have ordered the trilogy from

http://www.dragon.ca/

They take the boxes out of the equation so can send via normal air mail 
which reduces the costs. My order cost came toa pprox ï¿½30 for the 
trilogy which I thought was a steel
