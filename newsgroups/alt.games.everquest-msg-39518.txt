Sorry, this is bad how? And they can still buy it from someone else -
now they'll be buying it from someone who was an appropriate level to
earn it, not a high level farmer.

I hope that most players would be insulted at the suggestion they need
high level baby sitters covering the zone for them.

If they want safe, easy, and predictable, they should play Free Cell.

So it takes the information two weeks to be on the net instead of two
days. 

>Net result is that newbies will have no clue of where to go get equipment.

Obviously false, as the information *will* appear on the web in short
order.

Then have nothing to do with them, but it seems to me that it much
more encourages people to group up to go exploring.

How? In detail, please.

This is the only reason that you've stated which makes any sense at
all to me.

Newbie(s). Plural, not singular. And they won't be playing alone,
they'll be playing in groups in dungeons appropriate to them, without
the 'help' <cough> of the high level farmers.


Understand, I'm not very keen on the TCC either. But the reasons you
gave really aren't valid.
