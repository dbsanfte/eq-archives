 As a Monk I did some wonderful things with Instill Doubt/Intimidation.
I think it's one of the most underrated and overlooked abilities Monks
have. Obviously it halps to have someone or something to snare mobs but
that's not really a requirement. 

 Whether it's as useful to a Rogue or not? Hmm, I can't answer that.
Apparently it's harder for Rogues to get it to land successfully. It
doesn't hurt to train it up in your spare time. I personally don't like
having skills I haven't maxxed out.
