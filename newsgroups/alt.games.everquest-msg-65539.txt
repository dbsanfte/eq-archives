Lol,

i think you will find that almost every game you play will inspect your
hardware to make sure that its greater than the minimum specs, and so that
it can also work out how much to load, how big to make caches
(files/textures etc, etc), the list could go on for ever.  Stop being
paranoid, its not like the information was even sent to verant, or anything,
its just what the game is reporting.  If your being that paranoid, why dont
you even start questioning the BIOS of your PC, that "inspects" your
computer to check for available RAM, HD's, FD, CDROMs, etc etc etc.

Geez
