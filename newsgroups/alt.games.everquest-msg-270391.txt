 From the Norrathian Board of Equality:

Due to complaints from the Dark Elf, Evil Erudite, and Iskar Factions, 
the Tribunal has arrested Santa Claus and his pets for celebrating his 
favorite holiday.  Currently it is believed he is held in the depths of 
the Plane of Justice, awaiting his trail.

Apparently there were no equal representation from their repective 
holidays and felt it was necessary to remove the lack of balance in the 
holiday celebration.

At this time of his arrest santa claus refued a comment, however has 
pleged that justice will prevail. (hahaha - FOOL!)

Several folks have pleaded with the board of equality, however were 
killed on sight.  The board has no paitence with those who wish to 
celebrate holidays openly.

The norrathian board of equality is pleased with the result, and will 
work to remove futher instances of celebration and joy.  In addition, 
the board has announced they will be hosting and celebrating the openly 
gay wood-elf parade in plane of knowlege.  Everyone is invited to 
CELEBRATE their willingness to be open with their life choice.

(Editors comment: Sad ain't it? - No offence to gays intended)
