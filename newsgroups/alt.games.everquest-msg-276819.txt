The long-awaited and, in many quarters, long-needed mergers are
starting in earnest. This put me in a quandry regarding my playing
strategy.

  Adas recently dinged 69, then went most of the way through the
level in a couple of long MPG groups. Outside of MPG, RSS, and
such high-end, instant-death zones, she cannot seem to make any
levelling progress at all. A full quad of armor suits in HoHa didn't
move the blue bar at all. She must group to gain real xp, and that
likely must wait for the merge.
  Rabotev also needs a good group...preferably one with a wizard
to maintain a good kill rate. This would have been a small matter
when the level cap was 65; now, who goes to BoT or HoH?
  Neuveniu also has reached the levels where she is dependent on
groups to advance. Tosev may be able to solo a little longer,
depending on how the Great Un-Nerfing affects him (monk
mitigation is finally being fixed properly...we hope). My chanter can
count on OT groups for a while; my beast can solo pretty far up.
Grugg should be dusted off sometime, he can do 41-45 in OT now.
Celune is my best bet for moneymaking if she can get to 44; I have
her Temperance scroll banked. She has had good luck with groups
lately, so she may be my most used character for a bit.
  After the merge...hm. Have to wait and see. Best case, it will be
like old times again. I don't think this will quite happen, though; old
times were defined by a lot of people bringing up alts while waiting
for EQ2 and WoW. More likely, after the merge we should see
high end zones populated more densely, better group opportunities
for Adas and Rab.
  Then again, my co-workers are all switching to WoW. I will
probably have to go there myself, but I will want to keep one foot in
Norrath. It's still a fun place.
