That's what Fraps does.  The way most DirectX games work is they have
two things-they-draw-on (uhm...can't remember what they are called in
DirectX...surfaces?  frame buffers?).  They draw on one, and then tell
DirectX to display it.  They then draw the next frame on the other,
and tell DirectX to swap the two.  Next frame goes on the first, and
they tell DirectX to swap the two.  Repeat until the game is over.

What Fraps does, it appears, is hook the DirectX swap function, so
that it can figure out the frame rate.  It then draws the frame rate
on the thing-you-draw-on-in-DirectX, and it shows up on your screen.
Clever little program.
