    I've had Orc Centurions interrupt me. :-( Why even have Chanelling 218,
if it doesn't mean anything? And when mobs take a few swings, I Dodge once
and the others outright miss, and I STILL get interrupted....

    Anyone who stands under 1800 points of damage (1200 on PvP) is nuts. I
don't care if it DOES interrupt your spell to move, move. Making a wizard
spend 380 mana for 400 damage less resists (post reduction to 2/3rds) is a
good way to beat a wizard. And as an aside - with what few buffs I always
keep up as a cleric, I have 2200 HPs. Unless he does more than what you
list, he won't catch a cleric - we have too many HPs to die before the Gate
goes off.

    Unless that auto-gate is a Cazic Gate potion, or the auto-heal is
actually Divine Aura/etc., it will fail.

    That's an important point - you'd catch a LOT of casters without full
resist buffs up. Every screen I've seen of RZ the casters have a full set of
Resists up, whatever they can cast.

    Kael gear, with PoG to fill holes, ayup.

    If it was known that PvP could happen, I imagine it would look something
like this: ENCH gets cast on. ENCH runs ASAP to nearest zone, pulls plug.
Logs on alt, tells guild name and last location of attacker, guild attack
party sent out ASAP to kill "evil PvP monster". Note that as ENCH runs, he'd
be /shouting about what you're doing, prompting a wave of anti-PKs
(otherwise known as blue players) in the zone in question to rush to his
aid. Unless nobody liked the ENCH. ;-)
