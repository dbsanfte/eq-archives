In your level range in SK, you'd have Aviak Harriers and Avocets,
primarily
down around the aviak town (Known as KFC on every server I've
played on,) the Tesch Mal gnolls at the spires around the entrance
to Splitpaw, Treants, and Centaur Chargers.  Only the Treants have
faction hits you might care about, you may find yourself unable to get
druid ports without being invisible after hunting there a bit.

Aviaks have no faction hits at all, but do frenzy, which is to say fight
one
too close to another and you'll get an add.

Centaurs are mostly the same, except that the named centaurs do
have faction hits, so if you fight those you'll become KOS to the
other cents.

Most people, though, aren't KOS to either Cents or Aviaks on sight,
which means relatively safe medding in the zone.  If you want real
safety, med up on the ramps at the KFC, nothing but birds moves
up there, so you'll never be aggroed there (unless someone drags
an aggro mob up, which would be difficult and almost certainly
be done only to deliberately train someone.
