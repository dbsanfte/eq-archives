It allows you to have the damage bonus of a 40+ delay 2 hander, but with the
speed of an under 40 delay 2 hander.  At level 49+, the mithril 2 hander is
a 21/30 or 21/31 weapon that gets the damage bonus for having a 40+ delay.
That at least is the only reason I can think of for them to do it that way.
