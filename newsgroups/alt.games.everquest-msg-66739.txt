Is it just me, or do the rest of you Rnager's think we should be able to
bind?  I mean what's up with being the Outdoorsmen (and women too), and not
be able to bind?  Hell, we're a Druid Hybrid of short what gives?  My last
rant why SOW at 30?  Should be in the 15 - 22 area.  What do you Lords and
Ladies think?  Am I wrong on the Bind issue?  If we can't get bind how about
a sleeping bag?

Thanks in advance for you thoughts.
