You need INSANELY high tinkering to make them.

They require rare drops from mobs in Wakening Lands that hurt your PoG
faction.

All of them trivial over 200 skill.  The highest that Tinkering can be
advanced is 200 (this is a bug and should be fixed soon).  As far as I know,
there is exactly one (1) gnome that has gotten to 200 skill in Tinkering.

I'm not trying to discourage you, but expect to spend 100K - 200K getting
there.
