Different weapons definitely have different melee ranges.  When I had LSoEE 
and Swiftwind equipped I could still hit with one of 'em (couldn't tell 
which) while the other was giving OOR messages.

Mobs have to be able to hit for more than PC max melee range.  Just imagine 
being able to root something and whack away on it while it can't touch you.    
Not that ranges would know anything about that *grin*
