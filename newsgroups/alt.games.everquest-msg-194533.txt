I don't think I said that.  I feel that I think -this- is also a worthwhile forum
and that driving all bards away to some other forum defeats the purpose of this
one, which is a discussion area which mingles the classes together, instead of
dividing them up into their own little ghettos.

Nothing wrong with a bard oriented discussion group, just (to me) less interesting
than a mixed one; I like to see a rogue's take on these issues, or an enchanters,
or whatever.  And I like to read discussions about other classes, even though my
main is a cleric and my primary alt is a bard, and I happen to feel I know enough
about the game to at least ask interesting questions in those discussions.

Clearly you feel much the same way, since you are hanging out here even though
there's a perfectly good bard oriented forum you know the address to.

Can you explain just how there's "good" benefit to it, given the numbers I've
posted?  Are my numbers incorrect?  Or is it that 1/22nd improvement rates as
"good" for you?  I'm not convinced that there's any of the other first tier AAs
that are any better for taking after run 3, but that doesn't mean I'd call regen
more than a whisker's worth of worthwhile.  Of course I don't -have- regen (heck,
just finally went to the trouble of getting  run 1 instead of straight leveling)
so I have no direct experience.
