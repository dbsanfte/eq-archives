Snare takes time to cast, and then the spell gems have to refresh before 
I can FD; I'm not a monk, and this is one down side to that.

I don't see the difference between what you describe, and simply pulling 
with a snare; I'm still going to cast the snare, the mobs are going to 
split up the wrong way running towards me, then I'll FD.

The advantage is that it will take less time to get the mobs to the 
group, if the pull is long distance, and I've certainly done that... but 
it doesn't seem to me it will make the snared mob end up closer to me 
than the unsnared ones when FD lands.
