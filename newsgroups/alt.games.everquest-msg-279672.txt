Our guild has initiated an "Old World Wednesday" event.  On Wednesdays, you 
play a character specially made for the event.  No tutorial, travel by foot, 
boat, or port, no twinking, no added charatcer races (Vah Shir, Iksar, 
Froglok), Old World zones only.

Having said that, it might be nice to do that separate from my own guild and 
server.

Count me in (for the initial conversation at least).
