So, now that I've upgraded my kit, thanks to some helpful advice, I
thought I'd see if I could get similar help on my other question.

Frankly, after who knows how many levels in Oasis of Marr, I need a
change of scenery.  Any suggestions on where my newly dinged level 21
Dwarf Warrior can hunt?  I don't mind travelling.

Thanks,
Inyidd
