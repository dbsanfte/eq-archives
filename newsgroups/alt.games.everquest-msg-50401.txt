At least at first, leveling on Sullon Zek *was* a race...... it was a race
for the Good team to get as many people as high of a level as possible to
avoid being shut out of absolutely every decent adventuring zone in Norrath.
Between the Neutral and Evil teams, it was a race to get to get as many
people into Velious as possible to lay claim to it before the other team
could establish a foothold.

Last I heard, Tean Neut had Velious firmly in their grasp.  Most likely, the
race for levels on Sullon Zek is over (unless you're on Team Good, which
probably needs as many post-30 players as they can get.)
