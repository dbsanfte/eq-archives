Blah.  Don't ask me.  I'm into shoujo anime, not mecha.  And before
anyone screams at me, no I don't watch Sailor Moon :D

Oh.  Shoujo = girl.  Girl anime.  Shounen = boy. Boy anime.  Mecha =
nasty old robot cra-- *ahem* robot anime.

And hentai/ecchi >> al... *ahem*  Hentai = porn.  Ecchi = nearly-porn
(ie bouncing breasts everywhere and panty shots galore).

Uh... not that I'd know.

Ryou
(recommends Jungle de Ikou, in subbed OR dubbed format, for the
particularly masochistic)
