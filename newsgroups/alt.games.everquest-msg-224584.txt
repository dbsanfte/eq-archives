That train's already left the station. It started when they not only charged
people for the beta discs for SWG, they then forced everyone to pay the fee
even if they downloaded the software! There were plenty of rationalizations
offered for the cost of covering the CDs, the mailing, etc., but what it
came down to in the end was the realization that there was a demand, and
they were filling it. So they charged a fee. And people paid it. That's the
lesson we've taught them, and they are VERY FAST learners.
