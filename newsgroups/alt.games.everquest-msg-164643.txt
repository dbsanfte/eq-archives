I'd like to start a human (for role playing reasons...long story)
but I'm not too interested in playing a monk (especially since SOE
uber-nerfed them).

So I was looking at the classes available to humans (almost all
of them!).

Then I started looking at human stats.

Maybe I'm missing something, but it really seems like humans SUCK
stat-wise.  Not to mention their crappy night vision...

Am I missing something?  Who'd ever want to play a human?  A much
better choice is always available regardless of class!
