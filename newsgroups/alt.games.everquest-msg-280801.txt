Sounds like a good plan.  It's always great when friends play together.

It's really quite simple if you're not always looking for the easy way to do 
any task.  You have fun getting your characters all to the same place.  You 
agree on a place to meet an keep each other updated on your progress.  Of 
course a smart player would spend a little time leveling up a little before 
trying to meet in HighHold or somewhere similar.

Well, I never had any trouble running to docks or surviving boat rides. 
People who died on boat rides usually did something stupid like jumping off. 
And I hope any sensible cleric would be able to handle an orc pawn before 
leaving home.   In any case, the first thing you do is get a bind when you 
get to a new location so you don't have to spend time getting back to your 
friends.  These are all things that can be handled with a little effort and 
brains.  Of course, if you just want to play a game where everything is 
accessible and laid out in front of you then you have what you want already.

> Oh yeh, a boat load of fun that is.

Actually, it is fun -- it makes getting killed a serious event.  Adds 
excitement to the game.

Nonsense.  Crushbone to Highpass shouldn't take more than ten minutes if the 
server is properly populated.

Ah, choice.  That's exactly the point.  I want the choice to play on a 
non-expanded server.  What you do is entirely up to you.  I am not asking 
that the entire EQ world be returned to 1998, just one server.

Ignore away, Pancho.  Again -- I don't care what you do.  Either in game or 
out of it.

It is about having fun.  I had a lot more fun in the original game than I do 
now.  Not just because it was new and exciting, but also because it was hard 
and you learned to have fun getting to different places and avoiding danger. 
You, on the other hand, seem to like the game just the way it is.  That's 
fine too.

Whatever.  This has nothing to do with what I asked about.   I'll put you 
down for a "No, I'm not interested."
