I am thinking about trying Eq but cannot find out enough info online.
There is all kinds of info if you are a player but not a shopper.
Maybe some of you folks can answer these dumb questions.
Am I better off getting that new gold edition with all the games or
just buying them seperatly? I know game wise it is a better deal but
what about this? EverQuest Gold contains only one account key, which
will allow users to create a new EverQuest account, or to upgrade one
existing account with The Ruins of Kunark, The Scars of Velious, The
Shadows of Luclin and The Planes of Power expansions. Gold does not
allow the user to create or upgrade more than one account.
What are account upgrades? Am I better off having more than one
account? Does it mean I can only use one charactor at a time?
Can I buy a used game and use that? I heard that it cannot be done but
I do not know anyone that playes. Is there a website that has all of
this info? What is the differance between Eq and Eq 2?
Also I have an ATI 128 all-in-wonder is that good enough?
I hope that is not too many newbie questions at on time.
Thank you for the help.
