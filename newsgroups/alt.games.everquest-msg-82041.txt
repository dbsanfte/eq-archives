Ogre Warrior Ogre Shaman make a good combo.  They have added some
bears to the starting area for Ogres (Feerott) so there is a bit
more to hunt there until you get a few levels.  Then my fiends and I
(2 Ogre warriors and an Ogre Shaman) went to the zone right next
door.  Rathe Mountains has some nice XP hunting that will Take you
to mid teens.  Really Ogres are a great race to play and the
Shaman/Warrior combo is a good start to a group as you get farther
into the game.

Have fun.
