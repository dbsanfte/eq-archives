It's "pain and suffering"

remember when you bled to death you see

pain and suffereing tried to strike you but misses

In this game you don't really die from dot (bleeding to death) you die from
pain and suffering, what happen is when you are bleeding to death, the "pain
and suffering" in the zone would come to where you were lying on the ground
and finish the job. Hence exp loss in duels if you bled to death, because
you are not killed by another player but this NPC called "pain and
suffering". Lavastorm's pain and suffering is easy to track, its in a small
lava pool, stand there, make sure you are not targeting anything and cast a
PB AE, it will attack you and your target box will get a full red bar with
no name, pull it out and attack the melee message will say
"You hit pain and suffering for xxx damage"
yes it's killable with a small group, and lootable too.. doesn't drop
anything
