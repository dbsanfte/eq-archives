	Actually, even taking into account the insane PAL/SHD weapons that have
come down the pike(1), you have a substantial advantage over the knights
because of their low skill caps.  You may have as much ATK over them as I have
over you.

	Also, Lady Rumour says that the "triple attack for knights" in PoP is like
Ambidexterity in SoL; a very small chance of the extra attack actually going
off.

	All that being said I would have to agree that a knight is just as useful
as a Warrior in experience groups.  *I* can tank in most experience groups
these days.

	(1) Hey Verant, if you're going to give a class lowered damage output to
compensate for higher AC and HP (or a kickass pet), that means you do NOT turn
around and hand them ungodly weapons (or self-haste spells) to make up for
their low DPS.  I'm tired of being dead last in defense (BSTs tank better!)
and then finding out that knights outdamage my epics with weapons that drop
off mid-range gimp raid targets.
