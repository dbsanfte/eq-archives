Read the whole post before slapping your crap to the thread with
unnecessarily long quoting and top posting.

I am in no way selfish. I dont come shoo you off of your camp and i except
people to give me the same respect.

Althou i wouldn't conquer a whole basement of a green dungeon.
Because:
 a) It's boring.
 b) I dont need the crap.
 c) I have no attention span to auction (I dump stuff i dont use on a naked
newbies that i come across)

I have once done this in runnyeye when i wanted whole set of blackened for
my WE ranger whose almost all armour sets are ugly as hell. (IMO blackened
alloy looks cool on WE ranger)

Also killed all the rares when they spawned. Next to no people in zone so i
didn't have to argue with anyone about my camp. Wouldn't have propably left
my camp unless a guide would have come shoo me off.

Now get the hell out of my sandbox! :P
