    Tee hee! I'm trying to drill into the casual reader's head that if they
have gear questions, Allakhazam's is the place to go. Searchable by
atribute, drops linked to a bestiary so you can see what you need to kill to
get it - Allakhazam's answers a lot of questions about "what should I wear".
The Bazaar itself is the other great resource for a player with gear
questions, as you can see what can be bought and for how much on your
server. And it, too, is searchable.
