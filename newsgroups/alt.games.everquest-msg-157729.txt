No single cleric can Cheal faster than 1 every 10 seconds.  CHeal
rotations are generally designed to overcome that by allowing a Cheal
every 5 seconds or 4 seconds or...well anyway, faster than any one
cleric could do the job.  A 30 pause would require 3 clerics.  Cleric
one announces CHealburn.  Cleric 2 waits 3 seconds, announces
CHealburn.  Cleric 3 waits 3 seconds announces CHealburn.  Now a Cheal
hits every 3 seconds until the mana runs out.

You fizzle the whole thing at once.  Range same thing, happens when you
cast.  That seems easiest way to code anyway, but if its too
overpowering you could have it check range and fizzle for each Cheal
cast.  Its a pipe dream anyway, they'll never let us get away with
this, they nerfed MB stacking, clearly they don't want things to be
simplified.

I think it would be practical... I just don't think there's a chance in
Brell of them implementing it.

For balance purposes, A) you'd have to get a metric tonne of AA points,
B) you'd always spend all that mana when using it, even though the mob
might be dead, or the MA might die... essentially this would be useful
for serious mobs that you are very confident you can handle.  Use it on
a light mob and you are wasting much of the mana.  Use it on a really
dangerous mob, and you don't have the mana to start in a Cheal rotation
on the backup tank.  Remember that since the Mod Rod nerf, mana is
really an issue again.
