Actually, a low 50's enchanter can solo low 40's quite well. the 49 pet
really kicks ass, especially with sltw and dual wielded weapons. The only
problem is the pet sucks just about all the xp, so its good money, but poor
xp. Some of the best xp I get is just pairing up with a ranger and fear
kiting.with pet. Its about on a par with a decent seb group.
