You obvoiusly don't hang out with our guild. We got into Fear yesterday
and all the Mini's were down.  Within an hour, Freeport was in flames.

(Ok, actually we just turned around and went to Hate, which was fully
popped except for Inny. Took six hours, but we cleared the entire place.
And our Warlord *finally* got the hand of the Maestro. he he.  Not one
bard on the raid, and the amount of respectably decent bard gear that
rotted was INSANE.)
