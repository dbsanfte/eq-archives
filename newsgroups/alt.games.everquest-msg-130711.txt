And targeted tells are the way some folks choose to ask for help.  You to to
choose your actions but no one else gets to shoose theirs, right?  Your
belief seems to be that anyone who doesn't do things the same way you do,
either in game or on the Usenet, is an idiot.

As long as someone is polite (roleplaying is a plus, but not necessary),
I'll help in whatever way a 52 druid can.  Frankly, I'm glad to see that a
player is smart enough to use /w to keep from spamming the zone they're in.
"Gimme <whatever> plz" gets the character summarily ignored in shout, ooc,
auction, or tell.  No lecture ... no chiding ... just /ignore <beggar>.
That's something I can choose to do.
