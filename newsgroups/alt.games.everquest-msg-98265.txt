If they did add new low to mid lvl zones what is stopping all those high lvls
walking in?

Make it only for certain levels you say?

What your advocating is TLC (Trivial Loot Code) and that idea (IMHO) is totally
FUBAR.  
It has been tried already in the warrens and stonebrunt and linked to luclin
before they (sensibly) nerfed the idea.
(It was a VERY hated system - try a google search from aug-nov before luclin
came out and see some of the comments in this group alone)

Those that have reached lvl 40+ have put in the time and effort to get there
and are the people most likely to stay longer in the game (and pay more) than
anybody else, It's only good business sense to create zones to cater to them
specifically.

Considering the recent additions - Stonebrunt (a freebie) and Luclin you can
hardly say that low-mid lvls have been ignored.

I don't care what is written about me so long as it isn't true.
