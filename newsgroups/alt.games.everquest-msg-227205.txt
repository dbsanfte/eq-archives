Your logic holds true only if the person switching weapons is doing all 
the damage.  If its a duo, this may well be the case.  But in a normal 
group, you have one designated sponge, and two, three, or even 4 DPS people.

The sponge does damage too, to be sure, but if you cut his DPS in half 
or even eliminated it entirely, this wouldn't affect the damage output 
of the group all that much, at best he's doing equal damage to the two 
people that are there for DPS, meaning you lost a third of your damage 
output if his drops all the way down to zero.  More likely, you lose 
perhaps 20% DPS, and have 3 other people doing DPS, so you've lost only 
5% by changing to the slower but more protective weaponry.

If its a raid, then you might have 20 DPS people working away; reduce 
the damage from the MA and it means at worst a 5% drop in your raid 
damage output in those circumstances... and more likely, a 1% drop.

If this logic didn't make sense, then warriors and paladins and SKs 
would all be out of a job; they do less damage but soak damage better, 
which means you want them to do the sponge job while the rangers et al 
do the DPS job.  Whats happening with this suggested weapon swap is that 
the ranger is getting a bit more Spongelike.  Bad idea if you aren't 
working as sponge, but when you are, probably a Good Thing (tm)
