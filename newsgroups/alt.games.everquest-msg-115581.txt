I gave up on melee at about 20 on my enchanter.  It's a total joke...you may
do 50 damage while the SHAMAN (for god's sakes) can do double that and a
warrior can do 6-7 times that.  Why bother?  If you're FM and don't need to
do CC, then nuke and do some NON-JOKE damage.  If you're LOM, sit your ass
down. :)

Yes, Defense is definitely a good skill to get maxed...at level 57 I still
haven't figured out how to come close to maxing it without insta-death.  You
can't increase Defense unless you're hit, and if you're hit you're doing
something wrong if you're in an average pick-up group...work on Defense when
you're grouped with friends and the healers have mana to keep you alive just
to do that skill.  Good luck. ;)
