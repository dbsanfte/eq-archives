The problem are the HQ lion pelts, not the aviak eggs.
Got 0 pelts, 13 Griffon feathers, 3 mana vials (cant remember which one it is
for quivers), 20 aviak egg oil, 20 aviak eggs (i just eat them now whenever i
forage them).

Concentrate on getting the HQ lion pelts, i killed a lot of highland lions,
never seen any. The eggs are just a simple forage expedition to BB, usually get
1 or 2 when i port to ring, go check NE corner for oak bark, port to ring, run
to GFay.
