I understood the irrelevance of your point. Your
points are always understandable. You do not ever
have to worry about your points being too complex
to grasp. This is because you are a ninny.

>Nothing to get your panties in such a wad over.

My mistake. 

I thought when you entered this particular
sub-thread you had something to say. Maybe, when
you have nothing to say, you should say nothing,
instead of posting it. 

Of course, this would lead to a dramatic reduction
in the frequency of your posts.

And what on earth would qualify a Peewee Herman
such as you, to give advice on women?
