First of all increased STR will improve your max damage cap (not sure of
average but I would think so too).  AGI under 75 will cause you to take a
huge AC hit, and the higher the AGI the more mobs 'miss' you.  It is hard to
know exactly the numbers involved in this as it is nothing significant but I
have experienced a lot of fights where I am getting hit a lot less than even
warriors (I'm a Paladin), because of my much higher AGI than theirs (my AGI
is 120 unbuffed at lvl 44).

I think the reason they are 'suspect' is because it is hard to attribute any
great improvement to them seeing as it comes indirectly, unlike STA which
directly increases HPs, and WIS/INT which directly increase mana.
Personally good starting STR and AGI is nothing to complain about I don't
think, but as a Beastlord (or Paladin for that matter) I would concentrate
on STA and WIS items - STR items are in abundance anyway and it isn't hard
to get that up, AGI is not what I would call essential, but I do believe it
has an effect as I point out above.
