Not really.  You can hunt in Dreadlands as well, but, the drop rate is about
the same.  The one nice thing about DL is that you will still be getting xp
there, whereas, in FM, I would think they are green to you by now.  The only
other option is to auction to buy them, or hit the bazaar and see if you can
find them.  If you are going to go to a zone to auction to buy them, head to
DL, as there are more people there killing them than in FM typically.
