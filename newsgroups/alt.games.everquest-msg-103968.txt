Uberguild raids don't necessarily take a long time.  I had a friend in an
uberguild (Legacy of Steel), and his EQ time actually went *down* when he
joined them and started raiding 5 days a week.

I've read somewhere that the average EQ player plays something like 30
hours a week.  An uberguild can do most raids in under 5 hours, which means
they can do 6 raids a week, without spending any more time at EQ than the
average player.

The thing about uberguilds is that they are very efficient.  They don't take
an hour or two to get people together for a raid, and it doesn't take them
an hour to get everyone buffed, and make sure everyone knows the plan.  If
they wipe out, it doesn't take them long to do corpse recovery.  I seem to
recall my LoS friend telling me that in the worst possible case, it would
never take them more than maybe 10-15 minutes to get corpses recovered and
resed, and get everyone buffed back up and ready to continue, after a very
bad wipeout.
