I *don't* have a problem with kiting. If *everyone* involved has the 
ability to perpetually stay out of range. What I think is lame when the 
mob has a real choice of targets: one's he can hit because they are at 
point blank range, and one's he can't... and he perpetually chooses the 
one(s) he can't.
