As a low level shaman, they didn't have horses or drogmors in game, I had 
no pet, my equipment was laughable.  I was in my 50s by the time Luclin 
came around, and couldn't even dream of purchasing a horse at that point.  
My mana pool was a joke, canni 1 helped some, but not a whole lot, 
quiescence did not exist.  Shaman heals were a joke at many levels, it 
was impossible to keep up with the mob damage output when healing a plate 
tank, much less a chain wearing shaman.

I admit, that the conditions are far different now for a shaman than when 
I was low level, but, I don't have any experience as a low level shaman 
post Luclin.
