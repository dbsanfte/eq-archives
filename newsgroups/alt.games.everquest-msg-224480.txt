rofl... that's my favorite. Its even better when the male paladin is 
being played by a female too. Then there's all sorts of confusion... 
because she thinks she's dropped some clue that she's a female she 
wasn't aware of and that the 'hun' was directed at 'her'.

For my part I split my characters 50/50 male/female. But I don't 
roleplay gender issues either way unless I know who I'm dealing with 
(the 'player' not the 'character') and even then its pretty muted...my 
characters are pretty androgonous.

Unless I know 'you', I am simply not comfortable with the fact that I 
don't know how most people I encounter separate their avatar from their 
personality.

Some people are themselves: "What am I going to say?"
Some people are roleplaying: "What would I say if I were BurlyWarrior?"
Some people are puppetmasters: "What would Burlyguy say?"

People mix awkwardly when sexuality is an issue at the best of times. 
Add differing layers of personal investment/emotional detachment/ and 
then just for good measure add unpredictable gender role reversals and 
its just a horrendous mess.

I prefer to just ignore the whole thing 90% of the time.
