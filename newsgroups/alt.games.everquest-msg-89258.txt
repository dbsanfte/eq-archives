...and NO, I do not want to go to Lake of ill Manners.

Ideally, I want a dungeon where I can solo or group, and I will not get 
mowed down by mobs every five seconds. Preferably this would also be in the 
Old World, although I do not mind Kunark if there is an exceptional dungeon 
there.

I have been working FD, but it is still about 65 and I occasionally miss 
it... which can be a disaster :)

Any suggestions?
