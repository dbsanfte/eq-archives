Hello again all. Once again, I come to you for a little advice.

My warrior is now at level 30 (Just have to love that first hell level). My
biggest dilemma is that I am not really using anything fancy. I need a
little advice as to the things I might want to buy or begin to quest for to
make my warrior a little better at his job. Below is a list of what I am
equipped with now and my stats.

===Armor===

Head: Skull Shaped Barbute
Chest : Sarnak Emblazoned Tabard
The rest of my armor is Banded

Ears: +3 STR Earrings (One in each slot)
Fingers: +5 AGI Rings (One in each slot)
Neck: +5 DEX Necklace

===Weapons===

Primary: Gleaming Short Sword
Secondary: Blade of passage
Range: Long Bow (I carry 200 arrows at a time, since I decided to start
fletching)


I know it is time to upgrade my armor at the very least. I simply do not
know what to upgrade too. I have about 450pp in the bank and have been
hunting in LoIO, FM, and OT for the past 10 levels.

While my warriors stats are not bad, I know I need to work on a few of them.
These are his stats.

STR: 96
STA: 100
AGI: 110
DEX: 95
WIS: 80 (Don't think it really matters for a warrior)
INT: 67 (Again, I don't think it really matters)
CHA: 55

I hit for about 30 with my primary (Double attacking most of the time and
for criticals around 60) and I have a little less than 1100 hp (With about
550 AC). Any ideas or suggestion you might have would be most appreciated. I
was thinking of camping Dusty in FM for his Breastplate as well as doing
some of the crafted armor quests, But other than that, I am at a loss as to
what to do.


Thanks in advance for your help

Zacheia
