Hiya people.
Just wondering if anyone has a similiar config and if you are having
problems.

I have recently bought an AMD Athlon 1700+XP, slapped it into a Gigabyte
GA-7DXR mainboard. 512Mb DDR, Geforce 2 Ti (64Mb)
The mainboard has built-in a CT5880 creative sound chip and RAID support via
an additional 2 IDE headers.
I am running 2 Seagate Barracudas (40G) in stripe mode (RAID 0).
OS is windows XP Pro
Before the recent upgrade to DX8.1 It was rock-solid. Never crashed and
still doesn't in anything but EQ.
(Wolfenstein [lame twitch game], Stronghold, Half-Life [&Counter-Strike])

It seems to crash more often in some zones than others. eg Gfay it crashed
every 15min, Rathe Mounts, once every hour etc.

My 2nd PC, a PIII 450, 512Mb SDram, Kyro 2 vid card, SB Live, win 98.
Runs like a dog with all it's legs cut off and jammed in all available
orifices, BUT it does not crash at all. In fact if I disable everything it
actually runs as if luclin wasn't installed (apart from load times)

Anyone see this?

Desperately in need of suggestions that don't involve firebombing someone.
