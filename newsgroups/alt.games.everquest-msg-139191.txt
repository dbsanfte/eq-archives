Interlaced or bottom posting was already the norm when I started 7
years ago.

Uphill in a snowstorm, right?

No. Quotes, in moderation, are still needed to maintain continuity.
People often followup posts that can be days or weeks old, and if they
leave no trace of the original content, it can be hard to figure out
what they're talking about - especially for posts of the type "No, it
happened the other way". What other way? Without quotes, you don't
know. Many people use 'it's just above my post' as an excuse, but post
threading varies strongly from reader to reader, and most newsservers
drop posts now and then.

In other words, you can take your usenet expertise and stuff it where
the sun doesn't shine, flaunt it on a web based messageboard (which
work the way you seem to believe usenet does), or both.
