Translation: The maps are the best part of LOY, and we decided people don't
realize it yet.  So we are going to give them to newbies for the newbie zones
only, and get them hooked!

They keep talking about these tips but I still haven't seen them.  I hope they
aren't intrusive.  That "hey, don't hit him he's red" thing was =very=
annoying.  Heck, under 10 you dont lose exp or items on death, whats the best
way to teach the "don't hit reds" lesson?

Also, what I'd really love to see is a new con message; in general mobs from 3
to 5 levels higher than you are well within capability of a group, while mobs 6
levels and more over you are much harder due to difficulty sticking spells and
so forth.  Since for many groups, the "low reds" are the best targets for exp
and loot, an ability to differentiate one from the other would be very handy;
this would be similar to their differentiating the "exp greens" of the old days
by turning them cyan.  Orange Con, I'd call it.

Hope there's nothing that was in the old plane of Hate you needed... or you'd

This is a very annoying trend.  All new zones will be new only to people who
play on the premium server?  I guess thats a sound financial decision on their
parts though, cause every time they do it I consider upgrading.  If I was
swimming in cash I might have done it long since.  Where's my 300 million dollar
lottery ticket?

Having cast that line about 10 times total (half experimenting to see how they
worked out) I can't say I've ever noticed any discrepancy.

I thought this was a deliberate change!  Well this is terrible news for a lot of
soloers, and great news for the healer classes, since previously it was possible
to fight DOT casting mobs and survive, by zoning out while low on HP.  Yes, you
lost your buffs but you also lost the DOT that was killing you.

On the other hand, its also great news for soloer twinks; no more will I have to
worry that zoning out to avoid death is going to blow my KEI and HOV, requiring
another trip to the POK to get them reapplied out of petty cash.  Makes that
"extended duration" KEI a lot more interesting, since I should see it actually
lasting till it fades out on its own more often.

Untwinked lowbie  soloers, of course, A) can't afford KEI and B) don't have
enough HP from items to make this a frequent occurance.

Many?  I think people parsed this thru and concluded that 1/10 of 1% of the high
level caster population were flirting with the cap.  Of course that was pre POP,
perhaps that means 50% of level 65's were being capped out.  Not that depth of
mana pool is really all that important 99% of the time.

Undeads you mean?  Cause I might be more interested in playing my cleric if
there was content I could happily solo for actual exp again.  Not being flagged
for HOH yet, I can't say if this is what they were talking about, but I recall
complaints that certain undead became immune to root and/or got the ability to
summon, making them impossible to cleric solo.

I could have sworn I heard someone doing MGB Spiritual Light just yesterday in
POK.  Maybe they were agitating for this change?

This problem has been a massive nuisance; I fondly recall the days when crashing
meant no more than 30 seconds before being able to log back in.  On the other
hand, I'll no longer be able to hit /q, go take a shower, eat dinner, play in
the yards with the kids, and then come back and claim it took that long for the
server to let me back on (when it should have been clear I'd have been able to
log back at least two minutes earlier!)

See, this is what keeps me from getting a custom UI; then I'd have to keep
fiddling with the darn thing!
