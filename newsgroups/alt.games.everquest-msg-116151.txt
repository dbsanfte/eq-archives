Yes it sometimes does, but I don't believe that's the reason why MS is 
so despised.

Nonsense. Microsoft has in many cases impeded technological advancement. 
  Your example of PC pricing has very little to do with Microsoft, and 
very much to do with the way IBM released the x86 architecture.

Well, probably not. Does that mean its okay for companies to release
dodgy unstable software? Personally I do not consider Windows to be
worth the money MS charge for it. Its very restricting, bloated, bug 
rudden, unstable, full of security holes and it treats the user like an 
idiot. The only reason I use it is because most games only run under 
Windows, and I mostly play games on my PC.

The American dream is to monopolise the world? In every single market MS 
enter into, their ultimate goal is to monopolise it. Understandable, 
since they exist to make money like most businesses, but the difference 
is they do have the power to achieve that goal in most markets they 
enter into, and do we as consumers really want that? Personally, I would 
rather have the freedom of choice.

 > All of the bashing is driven by jealousy.

No, it has very little to do with jealousy.
