A) People are nuts.
B) When invited to a group, they think you mean "I have 5 people
ready to go and just need you"
C) They also can be picky, and when you say "I'm forming a group"
they may feel after looking at the classes and levels you have
that your group just isn't going to be a winner.

They may be correct at that last, too, "I won't join any group
that would have me as a member"; if you are going to have to
carry them around as dead weight perhaps your group isn't going
to make it after all!
