The punctuation being inside the quotes is historically correct, as
long as you're terminating the sentence at that point.  The way you've
got it has become more prevalent among programmers over the past
couple of decades, as *everything* inside the quotes is considered as
what's being quoted.

I found the mistake in .login  <-- a lovely sentence, which if you
terminate it with a period, is gonna make someone very unhappy.  Was
it in .login, or .login.?
