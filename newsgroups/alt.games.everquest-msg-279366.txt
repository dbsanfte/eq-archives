I was not talking about raid content above.  I was talking about high end 
single group content.

As for OOW, there is one zone that requires flagging to get into.  That 
is it.  The other OOW zones are either open to all, or are level based.  
As a low play time player, you should expect that it will take you longer 
to level and gain access to level based zones.  You should also expect 
that it will take longer to get gear upgrades.  Much like if I raided 
once a month, I will get a lot less frequent upgrades than I do from 
raiding 3 times a week.

GoD will be difficult at best to get to KT and beyond for a low playtime 
person.  PoP, I think we all pretty much agree, including SoE, that it 
was a mistake to make so many zones require flagging.
