I don't know WTF you guys are talking about with using BS to make it look 
like you don't stop fighting, or why you'd care about getting pp and 
backstab at the same time.

It's not like you have to turn off auto attack to backstab, or like your 
animation stops long enough to make anyone think you stopped fighting.

If you are gonna pick pocket in a group, just do it like you do evade.  
Attack off, pick pocket, Attack on, in rapid succession.  It's not gonna 
look like you stopped attacking, and more than likely you'll be able to 
fit it in between the delay timers going off.

And for god's sake, don't do it in a hotkey, do it manually.  Mutliline 
hotkeys take too much time to execute an evade in a timely manner.
