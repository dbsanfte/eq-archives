My main is a warrior too.  I *prefer* to have the caster do the looting - I
don't want to waste time looting - I wanna whack and hack...  but, I can't
stand all the dead bodies laying around.  typically, if the caster won't
loot, I /autosplit on, loot everything till I'm full/nearly encumbered, then
loot and destroy...

dead bodies, loot bags, and swords laying around can really screw up
targeting...
