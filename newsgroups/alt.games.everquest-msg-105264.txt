Nope. Never bothered checking into it that deeply. I bought the game
and the expansions and I play. Occasionally I check websites for info
though prefer to learn the game the old fashion way, like back when
people first started playing and there were no decent sites to check
out.

That's good of course.

And you're rude.

Ok, but a power outage would take them all out as inferred by the
other person's statement, BUT someone cutting/blowing up/causing
destruction of said lines wouldn't cause it to go out? Explain how one
will and the other won't.

Cut was a bad word. How about 'caused disruption of said power'?
Better?

Actually I was using the word 'hacking' as in someone outside of Sony
decided to take out EQ/Sony in any way possible. So yes, cutting the
power lines would be hacking as would someone hacking in through
computer access.

I never made a statement. I asked a question. Or did you not know that
a "?" symbol indicates a question?

I'm glad I don't know your friends.

My, this is such an extremely stuck-up and elitist group. I'm glad the
posters that have 'flamed' me here are not the general fare of folks
that I've found while I've been playing EQ.
