We've experimented with that, me pulling with Shadow (upgrade to
Stalk).  Basically, it lets me pull from a long way away, and not get
any agro at all.  The problem is, every time I do that, it seems the
mob heads right to a healer, no matter how much hate the tank is trying
to generate.  It really is easier for them to keep agro if they get it
right off the bat.  The only time I used Stalk for a good pull that
worked out the way we wanted was when we were killing the fairy queen
in Nek.  The pull with Stalk allowed me to pull the queen without
getting the attention of her bodyguards, but the queen still went
straight for a healer, even as far back as the lake edge.  The tank
came up with me though and started working on getting agro as soon as
possible (without getting the bodyguards to follow) so it wasn't too
bad.

When we are looking for something specific, I will track.  If we are in
a dungeon, or enclosed area, the tank leads and I call out which
direction to head.  If we are in an open area, I will lead and then
when I see the target, hail it so the tank can get it from me and then
pull.

Letting the tank pull is just easier, all the way around.  Easier agro
management is the main reason a tank should pull, since that is a big
part of their job - maintain agro.  The only time I really pull (as a
36 Assassin) is when I am soloing/duoing with a healer, or we are just
dinking around and leaving a path of destruction.
