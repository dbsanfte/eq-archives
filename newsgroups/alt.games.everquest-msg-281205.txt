After some thought (and a bit of chat with her guild leader) she's
decided to give the changes to EQ 2 more of a try.  Her complaint was
not that encounters were harder or that her class was nerfed  (in
fact, my impression was that she was leveling easier) but rather that
mobs that were grey are now green, so she couldn't enter zones she
used to play in w/o getting mobbed and taken down.  

I'm not sure how to relate her experience to what you are saying.
You're  saying that the upper level mobs in the zones were made more
difficult and the lower level mobs went down, but her experience was
that the level of the bottom tier mobs in the zone went up, not down.
