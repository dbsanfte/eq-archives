The firepot room is a closely guarded secret that everyone and their
grandmother knows about, no offense (obviously). In the room are 12 firepots
that, when clicked upon, instantly teleport you to the twelve major cities
of the world, Ak'anon Rivervale Cabilis, you name it. Every one can use the
pots, but only casters (that can bind) can bind themselves there.

As such, it's easy transport to almost everywhere. As a druid, you don't
really need it as you can port yourself around.
