Could someone please explain to me how a druid can solo as well as a
necromancer?  My 16 druid has to sit and med longer after a fight than my 34
necro does.  Soloing seems mind numbing without having any way to speed up
mana regen.  Or am I wrong?

I really want to like my druid, but I dont want to have to med for 15 mins
in the later levels.
