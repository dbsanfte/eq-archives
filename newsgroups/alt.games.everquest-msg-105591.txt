  Yeah, I was aware of the fire thing (especially after an embarrassing 
incident in Lavastorm where I left Combust memorized by accident*). I'm 
mostly concerned with Snare, Ensnaring Roots, and Immolate at this point. 
The things I can remember being really annoying with resists are fungus 
covered shrooms in Dawnshroud Peaks, dire wolves in Great Divide, a 
couple of mammoths in Everfrost, Dorn B'Dynn in North Ro (very, very 
green to me), Droon in East Karana, and generic cyclopses in Rathe 
Mountains. 
  Interestingly enough, the giant skeletons in Rathe Mountains (which are 
blue to me) almost never resist anything I throw at them. Maybe it's an 
undead thing...



* Hunting lava basilisks for eggs for working on my baking skill. "Okay, 
let me just nuke this guy and--uh oh. They're fire-based, aren't they? 
Let me just swap in Careless Lightning and...ow!  Ow! Hey, that stings!"
I had to run for the zone, reset my spells, and *then* go hunting.
