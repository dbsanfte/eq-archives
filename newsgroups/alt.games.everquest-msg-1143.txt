If theres one constant in the world, its the lack of certain people to post
intelligently, without vulgarities, and with some common sense.  Apparently,
there is no shortage of classless dweebs on the internet, and Dan Harmon is
living proof.

Not even close, im an old school, Beta 2 EQ guy.  I've NEVER, EVER
powergamed in EQ. I just don't have the time. Phat lewts? Traded for most of
em. =)

 Who said Necros cant solo?  Certainly not me.  What I DID say, is necros
that solo lose 50% of their exp to the pet, which makes soloing sucky. =)

So learn some grammar, learn how to act civil, and then come back when you
reach the pinacle of your 16th birthday.

Thanks
