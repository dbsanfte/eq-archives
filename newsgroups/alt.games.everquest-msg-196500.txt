I guess people are going to PC in droves. It was unfamiliar without
people fighting over the mobs and Sarnak camp.

There is no reason not to be in LOIO now, cause mobs are as plentiful
as ever. Lots of mobe make up for the xp modifier in PC, if two groups
are at one bandit camp, that isn't as good as one group pulling the
zone to a party.

Looks like I get to do some Sarnak quadding, unmolested!
