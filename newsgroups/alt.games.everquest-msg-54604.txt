OK, now I'm all confused.  I certainly don't think that Verant is an
evil company, or even that they have bad CS.  I think they are rather
arrogant in dealing with customers, and I think they have on several
occasions banned and/or deleted accounts without any warning, notice,
or justification.  All I am saying is that if someone suffers this
fate, it's not completely unacceptable to do a little ranting.  You
should have seen the language a guildie used when his level 58 necro
was deleted due to a Verant error.  It also took them 11 weeks to fix
the problem, not Gestapo tactics, but not the best CS either.
I think I'm a lot more likely to be labled a Verant ass-kill than a
Verant hater, but in this case, they fucked up, were unable to recitfy
the problem immediately, and pissed of a customer.  Let the man blow
off steam, Verant eventually fixed their mistake, and the customer was
reasonably happy.
