You'll never know how active they are about it other than the 'lip
service' they give you. There are legal roadblocks and lawsuit issues
to naming names on who you banned and why. That's why Blizzard is
vague and simply uses a general 'we've banned hundreds of accounts for
the speed hack'. It'll all come down to trust.. and sorry when it
comes to trust I'd put SOE slightly behind George W while Blizzard has
a very good track record.
