i've never actually wanted to flame anyone . ..

but look, you can make roughly 100p/hour (solo, or if no one cares about you
looting) at the camps in paludal caverns . . we're talking lvl 17 mobs here

stay for a few hours, make the fastest 500p you ever made


stop with this "camp this spawn and you can loot 4p items off it" . . .
genocide = money

clearing most 20-30's camps will make you plenty of cash, just based on
8g-2p loots that add up; PC is just my pat answer for everything
