Correct me if I'm wrong, but the zone mentioned for the spells was something
like Katta Catorium (spelling?) and not Shadow Haven. It's a difficult to
get to zone, most definitely not in a newbie area. Trying to remember from
EQ Atlas, it looks like you have to go through a lvl 50-60 zone to get to
it, fom either direction.
