It wasn't presented as a paraphrase but as a quote.  Note the quote marks.
I'm not going to play such games with any person that wants to twist things
in such a way to their favor.

"...and fighting..."  Yes, I would also consider that unacceptable.  But I
didn't say I would rez someone while I was fighting.  Only in-between
fights.

So it is alright for chanters and druids to make money while grouped but not
clerics?  That is what I viewed to be Davian's position.  I've been in many
groups where the chanter and druid make money off of people that come by for
a clarity or SoW.  Never once did they share that service fee with the
group.  But because my cleric's mana level determines the group's speed and
not the chanter's or druid's, I'm to "share" (a.k.a. give away more than 80%
of) any rez money I make with the group?  That's just unfair in my
estimation.
