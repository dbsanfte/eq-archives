If you expect to do a lot of buying/selling, make a new
level 1 character, move it *once* to the Bazaar and
leave it there permanently.  Transfer all your "want to
sell" items to it, along with enough cash to buy the
kind of items you might want.

Now you can buy/sell in the Bazaar at a moment's notice,
whenever the mood strikes you, by camping your primary
character and re-entering as your vendor mule.

The only drawback is that this is not available to
those folks on the one server that limits your
number of characters to one (FV, I believe).
