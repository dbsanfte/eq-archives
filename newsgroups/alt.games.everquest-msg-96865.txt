I general do not kill any animals inside Surefall Glade, Don't kill
any Treants(except Grizknot in South Karana, He's evil), Do
not kill any druids or rangers near any Druid Rings. You can
kill the Unkempt Druids in Rathe Mountains.

Most animals do not have faction. However, do not kill them with
in sight of any NPC druids or rangers or else they will gank you.
