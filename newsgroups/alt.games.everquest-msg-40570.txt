You do realize that the newbies don't know, either? :D  
I've found the *easiest* way is to turn right as soon as 
you get out of BB, follow the right wall until you hit 
the single guard, hoof it over to the double guards, and 
go down that aisle - then you skip the first left and 
take the second left - you'll pass a tree, and then you 
get to a bit of an open area with a chunk of ice in it - 
turn right and you're in Halas.  There are usually one 
or two newbies around if you're on when most other 
people are.  Just follow one that's being chased by five 
polar cubs ;)
