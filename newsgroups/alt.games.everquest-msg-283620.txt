You don't have to fight the waves as they spawn.  You can keep your
dain army right next to the giants but they won't agro each other until
the giants agro one of you.

When DoDH came out the monster missions were wildly popular.  The
lockout timers were shorter, maybe half an hour?  And each mission had
a seperate lockout.  Just doing the same mission over and over would
net you close to 2 AAs an hour.  However because the timers were not
shared, you could switch back and fourth and do better than that.  A
lot of people would do the Fairy mission in maybe 20 minutes and then
turn rght back around and do the orc mission (both in nektulous) in 20
minutes.

You could do the fairy mission very quickly because you could fight
very little or avoid fighting altogether (all the mobs were leashed).
Meanwhile you could skip a good deal of the orc mission.  We would send
one guy right off the bat on a suicide mission to hail the NPC.  Then
we would do a combo of fighting and mezzing-til-they-forget to free the
DE very quickly.  If you were fast with both, you would beat both
missions before the first mission's lockout timer was up.  Before they
seriously nerfed it all, you could get at least 3 AAs an hour.  This
was pretty impressive considering it had zero risk.

Something else you missed: you didn't have to loot that shard of
wisdom.  In fact you didn't have to zone in.  People would get several
in a group and then solo the fairy mission (one of a few that you could
solo).  There were some out there who were selling experience.  Give me
plat and join my group.  Then go to bed and when you wake up, 10 more
AAs.  That was absolutely ridiculous.
