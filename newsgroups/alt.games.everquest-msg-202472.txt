I'm an older player too, with the time constraints of a job and two children
active in extracurricular activities.  I play casters for the most part.
And I welcome this change with open arms.

No more will some moron with a KEI who is five levels too young to be where
he/she is be able to come onto the hunting grounds I'm using and wipe it out
solo, then bitch at me for wanting spawns.

Then you should be unaffected, if the level restrictions are the same as
they are for hig-end drui and shammy buffs.  43 is the lowest level you can
be to get these buffs.

If it were only that simple.

You see, the nature of this game makes it to where the way you choose to
play your game affects the way I'm able to play mine.  If I choose not to
get KEI, that doesn't stop the aforementioned moron from ruining my night.

Do you see the difference?

Sorry there Crash but you seem like a whiny little person to me.

This problem is very easily solved.  You don't like this person five levels too
young fighting where you are then move???  Who are you to determine that he's
five levels too young anyway?  Whats the freaking difference if he's there five
levels from now or if he's there now???  If he bitches at you put him on the
ignore list.  See your problems are easily solved and I didn't even have to
take away KEI from everyone to do it.  I'm not gonna make a whole lot of EQ
players sit around staring at each other so you don't get bitched at by a guy
you could easily ignore.  I have those same problems with people occassionally
too.  Ignore them.  You know what, there's still gonna be aholes even after
they take away KEI.
