Hi all....
I have a level 39, soon to be 40 Barbarian Shaman on the Tunare server.
After spending about 9 levels in OT, and most of a level in DL...where else
is there to go play?  Indoor?  Outdoor?
I ask because well, OT was as boring as hell, and DL seems to be a higher
level of boring.  :)   Ya know, the endless blue train to leveling.  Ok, a
lot of the stuff in DL is not blue to me, but, it seems to be the same
mentality.
Any thoughts?
