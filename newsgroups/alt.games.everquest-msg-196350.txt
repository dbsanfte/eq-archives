Other than the fact that he said himself that after KEI wore off, his 
mana slowly and steadily diminished, or couldn't keep up. If he were not 
the better puller than the monk or ranger at the time, he wouldn't have 
been pulling. KEI wore off and he described it as basically going 
downhill from there.

Yeah, I'd say KEI had a good bit to do with it. Once it wore off, he was 
a good bit less of a "super shammy", no longer to heal himself *and* 
debuff the mobs as the need arose.
