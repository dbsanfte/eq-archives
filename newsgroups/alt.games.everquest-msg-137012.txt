Not a 60 shaman here, just 54.  I was in The Grey last night soloing near
the ML zone.  A 52 druid came in while I was there.  In the time that I
soloed one Timeless Golem, and medded back to full, and started on my second
one, the druid finished quadding four and medding back up.  Maybe I just
suck at soloing.  I was using root and rot.  I tried soloing a Shissar, I
could not stick either poison or disease dots on him, after debuffing.
Zoned him.  I tried again, and managed to kill him with nukes only, plus
melee at the end.  I ended the fight oom, and at 40% health from Canning.  I
had Aego up at the time, or I would not have been able to do it.  Next time
I'll try using my pet, but, so far at least, against dark blue mobs, it has
worked out to cost me more mana keeping him alive than rooting and rotting.
