You've got 2 "3s" :P

Hate - multiple trips possible (though it seems to be dropping regularly on
Zeb)
Fear - freaking pain in the ass
Chardok - we easily did him & King with three 50+ groups (60 MT).  If you
hunt with relatively intelligent people (we all have guildies that are soooo
stupid even at the highest levels) it shouldn't be too difficult.

CoM - piece of cake with a CoM-experienced single well-rounded 50+ group.
Have AE mez up!!!  The trick here is that "CoM-experience."  The zone is a
little buggy but even without the bugs it's tricky.  When you get up to the
top of the see-thru ramp you'll be hit by about 5 critters unless you go
through the trouble of pulling them down with a monk.  Once you get to the
second-to-last building just camp there.   This can be a boring camp but it
WILL be an EXPERIENCE camp, so it's got a silver lining.  It's also likely
enough that someone will come away with one of those Ornate Runed Shields
(the caster grey/white diamond-shaped shield).  My gnome looks quite nice in
my Siren's Scale, Guardian or Nightie (white robe from Shar Vahl) robe with
my snake in one hand, and the ROS in the other. <g>
