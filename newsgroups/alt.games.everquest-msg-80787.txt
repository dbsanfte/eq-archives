Opinions are like.. well, you know the saying.

In MY opinion, the most fun melee class is a Monk (awesome damage, you
hardly ever die with FD, pulling, self-heal, etc) and the most fun caster
class is druid or bard.  It all depends on what you like.  For me,
self-survivability is very important which is probably why my three
characters are monk, bard, and druid.  All have fairly good means of escape.
