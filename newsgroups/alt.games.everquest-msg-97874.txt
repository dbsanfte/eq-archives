Wow, lots of changes.. Looks like Enchanters were mostly ignored again. I
don't remember any changes to enchanters for a long long time. 1 or 2 spell
corrections has been it. We want new spells ;) and have more control over
our pets. I do however like a LOT they are tryin' to fix the LD (Link dead )
problems, Now if they just fix it so when you are fighting a mob. ( Even a
BAT, or WOLF that is green) that when you return to game your not dead. I
always hated that. They keep you stuck on the game till you die You can't
defend yourself, run, or anything.. You just die.. That always bothered me.
I will take a look at the combat window, I think I will like that too.. I
guess I am just sounding off since I love EQ, and love my enchanter. It
really is an addiction, I need my EQ fix. The only other thing that I
bothers me, They need to shorten the time it takes to patch EQ. I can't sit
still, or breath right till I can get on again.  lol
