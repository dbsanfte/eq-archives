The Pet Plan (tm) Part 1 
It's taken me a while to wrap my head around this, but I'm finally at a 
point where I think I can present something. This is a break down of what I 
think is a logical and sane break down for pet melee mitigation. I'm 
posting this in %s relative to the current mitigation of the Air pet, 
because it's unchanged, and it just ended up making the numbers cleaner. 
This first set of numbers is all for the basic pet NPCs unfocused. Positive 
numbers reflect an increase in mitigation 

Mage 
Earth: 5% 
Fire: -5% 
Air: 0% 
Water: -5% 

Right now the earth pet is taking about as much damage as the water pet, so 
it'll be picking up a 10% bonus total in mitigation. for focus effects 
you'll be picking up 10% for Summoner's boon, and 2% for each tier after 
that (Darkness, Eternity, Ritual, Discord). Chaos is probably getting 
removed for now, as it doesn't really have a good place to go in the 
progression of the expansion. Instead, I'm planning on making spell 
specific foci for each of the pets equivalent to ritual summoning. That way 
you'll be able to pick up 4 separate items to gain the overall benefit of 
ritual summoning without having to do the LDoN raid if it's not available 
to you for whatever reason. They will most likely be augments. 

Necro 
RZ: 0% 
Saryrn: 2% 
Bert: 0% 

Now, these don't' really make sense, but I don't have a way of making  them 
make sense without nerfing something, and I don't think there's a need for 
that. The focus effects will follow a similar progression as the mage ones, 
but the necro ones will only be gaining a 7% bonus from ummoner's boon 
because frankly, mages needed and necroes don't. 
Each of the other foci will gain 2% on top of that. I'll also be splitting 
up the ritual focus into 3 individual items, 1 for each pet. Although I'm 
not sure that really makes sense as the RZ pet is pretty much obsolete once 
you get Bertoxx. 

Beastlord 
Arag: 3% 
Sorsha: 5% 

Beastlord pet melee mitigation is staying the same for the time being, I 
don't see a reason to adjust it right now. The focus effect changes will  
mimic the necro progression with a 7% basic increase from Summoner's and a 
2% increase after that. 

Overall, all the pets are getting an increase in melee mitigation across 
the board with a few exceptions that are staying constant. In no case 
should a pet be losing mitigation should these changes go live. 

As a point of reference PC mitigation abilities look about like this for 
average gear: 

War: 44% 
Pal: 39% 
SK: 39% 

I'm also still looking into changing Calliav to block any detrimental spell 
instead of just DDs. I'll have to mull over the impact of that a bit more 
though. If you start to figure in all the potential changes with the new 
pet mitigation AAs, the potential for much easier buffing with Pet 
Affinity, and the proposed changes above, you're looking at a fairly 
significant upgrade to the survivability of pets. 

Any feedback you have would be most appreciated.
