I've got the fungi and Toland's bracer covered. Fungi is one of those
items I just can't bear to sell even though my shaman hasn't even
considered wearing it since getting Torpor so putting it on my ranger
isn't a problem. Toland's bracer is one of those items I decided to
splurge on, it's the only item worth more than a few hundred plat that
I've actually bought for him. I'm working on the solistice, hitting up
the tradeskillers I know atm to see what parts I can get cheap before
I hit the bazaar.  

I'll keep an eye out for the Toland's BP but my guess is that it's not
something I'm gonna buy. Since I can get gate potions at cost it would
take a lot of those to cover the price of the BP and I don't have THAT
much money to blow on an alt right now. 

One question about that cloak you mentioned, is it item or spell
haste?

I'll definitely take a closer look at that staff, I don't think
they're all that expensive on my server. Given that it has a higher
recommended lvl than my current weapon (pasted below) and would cost
money, it can wait a little while though <g>.

Thanks, I'll ask around and see if the people I know are keyed for
Sky, I assume that I can have my corpse summoned to this particular
island? Having to waste the time of one or two groups to get people
keyed is the kind of thing I try to avoid for an alt even if the
reward is nice. 

Thanks for your help,
