Then go Role.  This allows you to keep your guild tag up, but conceals
your class and level (both unimportant to this problem) and your location
(which is why I'm suggesting it).  While he'll be able to spot you if he
happens to be in your zone, he won't be able to instantly figure out where
you are every time he wants to.

Try making a point of going places he Can't casually get to, instead of doing
zoneline stuff.  Places like Chardok and Seb are the worst for you to
camp entrance at, since he can very very easily train to your location and
you have no easy way to run.  But if you were working say Crypt, there's
very little chance he's going to get in to bother you without help, and you'll
find there aren't many people who will actively help some nut grief you.

You want to send a message.. but don't.  Because anything you say or
do can probably be twisted to look bad in a report/petition.  Instead,
you might want to look into getting him to say things that you can petition.
He's been able to train you without getting punished for it... perhaps he'll
be willing to help you out by saying as much.

If he's doing this sort of thing regularly, you may be able to get a GM
to come watch him do it.  GMs are capable of a form of invisibility that
can't be seen by see invis, and takes them off the /who lists as well.
They can sit anywhere, watching and "listening" to any say/ooc/shout
conversation.  Problem is a clever griefer will do this sort of thing
only rarely, not repeat it, and never ever say anything in any channel,
even tells, since you can report anything you see.  Since GMs are
busy, they can't sit around for hours waiting.  The Griefer, on the
other hand, can go play happily for a few hours somewhere, then
come train you again, and then leave and go back to whatever, having
spent only a couple minutes on you.
