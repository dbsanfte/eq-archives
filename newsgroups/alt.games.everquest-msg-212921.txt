A) most enchanters in the KEI trade I've talked to say they haven't noticed much
drop in income with the nerf, 45+ people apparantly made up the bulk of the cash
flow anyway; genuine lowbies didn't have much cash to donate, and twinks have a
tendency to be cheap in the way only truely rich people can be (ask a waiter who
tips better, a stockbroker or another waiter)

B) if you don't take cash for clarity or breeze then you aren't the sort with
the temprament to make cash from KEI.  Its a deadly dull job, and you have to be
deeply into the idea that sitting around casting a buff on people for money is a
fun thing to do.

C) so join a guild that raids, and you'll get KEI for free eventually when it
drops, or go after the research parts to make it.  Buying spells in the bazaar
is cheating yourself of the fun of questing for them yourself.  Not that I'm
above doing so, but its certainly not the only way to get them.
