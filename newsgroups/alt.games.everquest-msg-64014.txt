This is a wasted new race.  Think of kitties people would your loving house
cat not make about the best monk there is? This is a major waste.  And its a
class that needs a new race.  Only two can be monks.  human and iskar and
what do the other races get?  A new class Woot.  what do the monks get a new
class? noppers.  Some new items from what I have seen in posts.  but Kitties
should be able to be monks.
