You've done it now - this is how urban legends begin. This is now right
up there with 'if you keep the fletching book in your inventory or bank,
you'll increase you chances of successful combines' and 'if you run 15
times widdershins around the dark elf vendor camp, then chain cast
glimpse 6 times, the AC will spawn'.

P.S. What is the guards name? I want to level up on him and be a l33t
uber-god.
