  Basically, TLC kicks in because somebody in the group who got credit for
the kill, didn't get experience.  This can happen either because the mob is
green to one of the people in the group, or because there is a big level
disparity between the group members, and one person isn't getting experience
because somebody else in the group is too high.  (Or, if you aren't in a
group, TLC will kick in because the mob is green.)

  TLC only effects LORE and MAGIC items, but it effects them all.  Since
most quest items are either LORE, MAGIC, or both, you have a limited window
of oppurtunity in which to complete any quest that requires that you kill a
lower level mob.  However, lots of the quest items that are NO DROP on other
servers, are not NO DROP on FV.  Only newbie tunics, epic weapons, and a few
epic weapon quest items are NO DROP... so you can "hire" somebody to help
you with a quest if TLC is hitting you.

  I generally like it, but it does create a few problems.  For example, it
makes some trade skills even more difficult.  High Elven and Dark Elven
cultural smithing require MAGIC items that drop off lower level mobs to
create tempers... and these drops are kind of rare to begin with.  It also
makes some of the Iksar quests basically impossible to complete... you need
items off mobs that green at at VERY low levels, but the items are rare, and
if you hunt nothing but the mobs that drop the items you need, they still
may go TLC before you get it... and now that you can't de-level before level
10, this is an even greater problem.  And some of the higher level Iksar
quests require that you have completed a lower level version of the quest
first.  Sucks for them.

  But it's nice to be able to loot basically anything, and not have great
items rot on a corpse because nobody in the group needs it.  It's also nice
because you can pass around your J. Boots for a hit of speed. :)
