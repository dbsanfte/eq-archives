I'd welcome that as an encounter format; but I'd be hesitant endorse 
that as the premise for an expansion a la LDON.

I *don't* have a problem with a you-fuck-up-you-lose proposition. I have 
a problem with a you-fuck-up-you-lose-unless-you-brought-a-necro 
proposition.

The necro is a get of out jail free card; he will be considered 
essential. (to a lesser extent a cleric & pali too... but only a necro 
will survive a wipe, **and** allow the mission to continue.

Its not right for one class to be that pivotal in a mission. Its almost 
as bad as putting in locked doors that must be passed that require a 
rogue... or an impassable chasm that can only be crossed by porting 
classes...

In a raid type encounter go nuts... but in a <=6 man group? That sort of 
class dependance is out of place.

Yes, I know you don't *have* to bring a rezzer, because if you can do it 
without dying you don't need one... but most people aren't going to take 
that risk. You must know that.

I've been in that group so it does happen. Given that you can do most 
normals with 3-4 people, once i've got a decent core I'll add anybody, 
regardless of duplicity. And if noone is around (i play off peak this is 
quite common), I'll just go with the core. We usually still win, and its 
a lot more fun.
