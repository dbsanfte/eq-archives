So you advocate irresponsible pet ownership.  I guess in a world populated
by such people neutering animals is the best defense against the collective
irresponsibility of their owners.

Ironically, the people that actually get their pets "fixed" (lovely
euphemism for "broken in a way that makes them less of a burden") are
probably the ones least likely to have issues with unfixed pets.

Some of the common "reasons" for neutering for these people include reducing
the risk of ovarian/testicular cancer.  Well, guess what, same applies for
humans.  But I still have my balls.  I'll accept that risk.  :P  It's an
excuse fostered to assuage the conscience of doing something that you *know*
the pet wouldn't agree to if it had any say in the matter.
