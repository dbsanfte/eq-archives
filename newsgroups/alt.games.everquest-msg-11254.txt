How do you round 20 times 1 silver to get 2 gold 1 silver? Is my 1
silver really 1 silver 0.49 copper?

Nothing becomes cheaper. Whenever you buy more than 1 of an item at a
time, it costs a little more. Yes, even buying 2 items costs more than
buying 1 item twice. I'm just glad this doesn't happen when I *sell*
stacks of things, but it does make me wonder why they couldn't get the
math right for buying stacks when it is accurate for selling stacks.
