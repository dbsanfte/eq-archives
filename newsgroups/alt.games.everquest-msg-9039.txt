I recall a thread posted here about the Evil Eyes that will charm a
player and cause the player to start attacking member of his/her
group, and how clerics/shamans would have to use Dispell Magic to
break the charm spell.  

I'm confused about some of the suggestions to speed up the process of
removing the charm.  I've heard that casters should cast junk/short
lasting buffs first on the tank and save the good buffs till last, the
theory being that the junk buff would wear off and there would be an
empty space on top; then if the Evil Eye charmed the tank, the charm
icon would be on top, and then when the cleric/shaman cast Dispell
Magic, it would work on the charm icon first, since it was on top.
But then I thought I also read that Dispell Magic actually works on
the BOTTOM spells first, so one should have junk spells there, leaving
the empty space there for the charm icon to land (and thus being
cancelled first).  Which is correct?

Also, I thought I remember reading somewhere about mobs that will
erase the spells a caster has memorized in his/her gem slots (I think
it was a cleric saying he always keeps Divine Aura in his bottom slot
so it will be the last one erased).  Is that true, and if so, which
mobs do this and where are they located?

Thanks in advance,
