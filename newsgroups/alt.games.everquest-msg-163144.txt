I play a bard.  When I get in trouble I typically run to zone and by the
time I get there the mobs are so far behind that they don't bother anyone
afk at the zoneline.  They just turn around and walk home.  The only time I
got anyone killed (afaik) is the time that wizard tried to loot one of my
kills and got nailed by 8 toilers and a spectral wolf.
