I have been having this trouble for awhile now and have tried all I
can think of(I am not a computer whiz by any means but have managed
to fix most of the PC trouble I have had to date).  My system is a
500mhz pent, 768ram, Soundblaster live value, Nvidia Geforce 3 TI
500 and I run Win XP now.

What happens is the video skips, but not when I log in and start
playing usually.  Almost every time it does this after and hour or
so of play then I start to get choppy video when I turn or move at
all.  This happens in any zone and it doesn't matter if I am the
only one there or if zone populated.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.
