Of course it depends on your definition of low level.   My level 21 druid was
able to hunt there with no problems.   Most of the mobs were low blue to
green, and all of the ones that dropped that earring would have been very
green.   True they were more dangerous than normal greens because of the Harm
Touches, but not enough to make it into a 30+ zone.

IMO, 20 - 30 definitely constintues a low level zone, when we're talking about
an item this good.
