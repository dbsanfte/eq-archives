oh yeah, that warning is so useful.  IF you see it scroll by. If you are 
in a group pulling multiple kills and your chat window is flying by, 
there's no way you'll see that message.  I started a newbie and was 
looking for that message and still had to scroll back a long bit to read 
it.  I don't see how a newbie who doesn't know it's gonna be there is 
gonna see it.
