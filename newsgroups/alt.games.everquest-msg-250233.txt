If you hit F9 repeatedly it'll cycle through various camera views.

In some of them, particularly the "distance" views, you can then
use, uh, I think it's Ctrl plus the left/right arrows to swing the
camera viewpoint around and look at the character from different
angles.  (And Ctrl-up/down arrows to angle the viewpoint up and
down, too.)

There's a lot of user interface that's not documented well (if at
all) in the printed or in-game manuals.  One way to look for useful
commands is to do alt-O (letter Oh) to open the options window, go
to the Keyboard options, and browse the rather extensive list of
commands.  (Or even change the keys used for those commands.)

Your son might want to use the options window to assign a key (which
can include ctrl/shift/alt if desired) to the camera angle he likes.
