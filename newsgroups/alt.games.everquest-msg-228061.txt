They have basically stated (in IRC chats etc...) that it will be in the
fantasy genre.   Aradune keeps stating over and over that they "are trying
to bring Keith Parkinson's paintings to life"
http://www.keithparkinson.com/

Another comment often repeated is "just look at our team... what else could
it be?"

If you read the FAQ, they have leaked enough info to determine that the game
will be the best that EQ was combined with all the lessons learned in the
past four years.   The programmers also state that their graphics and models
are better than any previews you have seen from any game to date.   Big
words but if any team can do it, theirs can.

Only bad news is don't expect a game until mid 2005 at the soonest.  Do
expect a long beta process similar to how the original EQ beta.

I hope to see an  alt.games."sigilquest" created as soon as "sigilquest" is
replaced with an actual name.

Expect to hear the official Sigil announcement possibly as soon as January.
