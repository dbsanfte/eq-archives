I prefer the Enc/Cle combo. Cle roots when charm breaks. My enc never bought DC. Cle heals charmed
mobs. Sure the cleric adds no DPS but there are too many other benefits I like about having a high
level cleric. I also duo in ldon although charmed pets don't seem to do much extra damage there. Cle
Enc combo makes putting together a ldon group a snap. I have even done a few ldon hard, but this
requires a very good puller for me to safely duo in.
