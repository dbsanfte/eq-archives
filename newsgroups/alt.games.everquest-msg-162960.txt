the rangers i group with use archery as there primary means of doing
dammage. They use it instead of weapons at least equal to 12 20 (all have at
the very least primal). Some mobs in pov are snareable and do not summon. It
is entirely possible for a ranger to solo those mobs. Since soloing isnt
real important I dont really give a shit , but dont try and lie about it :p
