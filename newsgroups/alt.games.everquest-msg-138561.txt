I went to a lot of fun zones in the 30-40 range with an experienced player
that knew his way around the zones.  If you have a lower 30 group SolA is a
lot of fun.  Dalnir and ToF's were also two of my favorite zones at this
level.  ToF's is great, because as your group advances you can keep going
back to reach the higher levels.

We tried Kaesora and I think it would have gone well, but we needed a bigger
group.(rogue, tank and druid were not enough)  The nice thing about that
zone is binding in FOB.
