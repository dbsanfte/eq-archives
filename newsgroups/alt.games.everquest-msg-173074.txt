We've been hanging out at Highkeep for a couple of weeks now.  Trouble is,
Highkeep is often overcrowded and sometimes we aren't able to find a group
at all.  Does anyone have a suggestion on another place that we can go to
hunt for the next few levels?  Somewhere that's good for about 25-35, maybe
somewhere that's close to a bank and merchants like Highkeep?

Thanks )
