   Here is an easy test to discover if you have an improperly cooled chip.  
Take off the side cover, start your system.  Point a large desk or box fan 
at the exposed cpu.   If you can continue computing past the normal lockup 
time, then you have either NOT got a good enough heat sink or it is 
installed poorly.
