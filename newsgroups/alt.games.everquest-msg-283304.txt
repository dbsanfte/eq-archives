 I did that with a player in PC who said I trained them. They were at
the tunnel to the zoneline and I had gotten a bad pull and made a
break for it. They said I wouldn't get another kill while they were
there and they were true to their word. I did the /report and
/petition thing and got a canned response back saying I had to file a
/report to prove my claim. I then filed another petition saying once
again I had the /report. Guess what was their reply? See above.

Thye person was online the next day. What good is petitioning when the
people that are supposed to enforce these rules go DUH....

If they can't do anything to a guild who exploits in pok then why
bother. They evidenlty don't care. Let the uber guilds pay their wages
I'll just play Escae to Norrath for free. Boring but I get to try out
a few race\class combos I've never before.
