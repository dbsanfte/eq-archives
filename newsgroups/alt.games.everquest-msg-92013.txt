I am a fairly new player to the game and I am in a newbie guild.  While I
still don't fully understand all the functions of a guild I have found it to
be a good source of support for me especially when entering new areas.  Just
last night I found myself lost in Blackburrow (even with a map) and two
guildies came and helped me out.  I was able to buy a skinning knife that I
needed from a guild member, when all of my WTB's in town had been ignored
for several days.  I think that the majority of us are in the 12-25 range,
although there are a few higher levels.  This particular guild seems to have
a lot of mature, good, curteous helpful people in it.  That is probably not
the case with ALL newbie guilds, as I am sure is true of the higher level
guilds as well.  Basically from my perpective I would offer the same advice
that others have given.  Let her try out a guild, and if she doesn't like
it, she can easily leave and join another.
