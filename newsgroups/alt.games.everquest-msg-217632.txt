Multiplayer online games have become very complex and very popular
recently. They have the capability to transport players into an
alternate social universe more powerfully than ever before. The
benefits of these games are questionable. As more and more people
spend endless hours playing and many get addicted to these games, it
could become quite damaging to society. I wonder if any of you share
the same opinion?

Most people have not realized how big the game industry has become.
Take for example, Electronic Arts-one of the largest company that
makes and distributes games - total sales for last year was close to
US$2.5 billion and compare that to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc, a major
Hollywood studio and distributor, whose sales last year were only
US$1.7 billion. Research predicts that annual revenue from online
games to reach US$1.8 billion by 2005. Gamers have competed yearly at
World Cyber Games Challenge (WCGC) since 2000 with 17 participating
countries. An individual player can win up to US$40,000. It has come
to a point where champions are treated much like Olympic athletes and
become celebrities among the gaming community.

A game introduced some months ago, Ragnarok Online, has become
extremely popular in Asia and this game has the capacity to hook up
millions of users globally. Thai authorities were so worried about
students abandoning their studies and not sleeping that they imposed a
national ban on online games from 10pm to 6am daily. It is quite
obvious that game addiction of this scale is no longer an individual's
problem but a bigger issue that society has to deal with.

In my opinion, these games have become a replacement for real social
participation. The social and health problems with these addictions
are many, for example sleep-deprivation,  lack of hygiene, marriage
and relationship failures etc. A 24-year old South Korean man was
found dead last year at a cyber caf� after 86 hours of continuous
playing. The game "EverQuest" � nicknamed "EverCrack" by gamers � was
the reason behind a man in Tampa, Florida, fatally neglecting his one
year old infant. Perhaps these games should come with warning labels
or have a limiting play time factor embedded into the programs. How
about using some of the revenue from game sales to assist  games'
addiction research and support groups? Please share your input or
ideas.
