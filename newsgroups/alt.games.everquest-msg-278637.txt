Despite all the times that this gets spread around forums (usually second or
thirdhand by people with no actual knowledge, as above), I have yet to wait in
a queue line to login to WoW, playing regularly at primetime US times, since
January.

As for the max level content, as with any other MMOG, it is what you make of
it.  It could use quite a bit more than there is currently, but it does have
more "max level" content than original EQ did when it launched.  In my
experience, since the trip to 60 isn't as tedious as other games, more people
are tending to play alts up through the levels, so the faster leveling
balances out with the increased replayability, resulting in many powergamer /
leveler / whatever you want to call them types getting the same amount of
playtime out of it that they do out of other MMOGs.

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
