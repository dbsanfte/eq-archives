It's one of the downers of being agnostic, looking at the Fierce
Heraldic armor in the bazaar and not being able to use it. My agnostic
troll warrior can relate. Trying to find armor for an agnostic troll
on Bristlebane seems to be a futile effort.

Given about the same DPS with both, it seems to me that a 2 hander
will keep agro a bit better but that might just be my imagination. 

One advantage you get with dual wielding is that you can get a proc
off of the second weapon, which (all else being equal) should up your
proc rate by 50% since the offhand weapon procs abouit half as often.

Depends on your level. I wouldn't worry too much about procs to hold
agro, at least before 50th lvl. You'll hold agro more consistently
with high ratio weapons since you can never count on getting a proc
when you need it. There are a still few weapons out there with
excellent ratios that don't have a level cap, I'd tend towards those
at the lower levels.  

You can also look at Veksar for some decent weapons with a relatively
low recommended lvl (45). One or two from the 'remains' camp even have
excellent taunt procs, and unlike some other weapons, those never seem
to get resisted.

Ideally, you want everyone else (including pets) to be hitting the
rear of a mob. People take less damage (no ripostes) and do higher DPS
when attacking from the rear.

Don't forget to buy your agro disciplines, they're excellent for
pulling or for grabbing a mob off of the puller on incoming. 

Play around with /shield and consider making a hotkey(s) to
automatically shield one or two of your more important casters
(usually the cleric).
