Well, here's mine:

a) variants of red for any critical messages.  I define those
as shout, rampage, spell failures, etc.

b) variants of gray for non-critical messages.  I define those
as ooc, auctions, etc

c) variants of green for 'normal' messages.  I define those as
say, emotes, etc.

d) light blue for guild, brighter blue for group, and something
in between the two for tells.

e) primary raid channel in dull yellow.  cleric raid channel in
bright yellow.

and so on and so on...

That lets me react based on color.  As a general rule, only
the REALLY important stuff is bright enough to get immediate
attention within a color group, with lesser importance getting
progressively duller.

Add hitsmode in their own windows so my chat windows (one for
"normal" and one for raiding aren't tied up.  Lots of clutter,
though:  I put in feedback on not having the hitsmode windows
fade their text after a certain time, the one thing really
lacking from the newUI implementation.
