He's right, Shaun.  If you are not used to zoneline fighting then word to
the wise:

-ANYTIME anyone at all yells TRAIN be prepared to zone.  I don't care how
close to death your mob is, I don't care how focused you are.  Keep those
/ooc and /shout channels open and brace for it.

- Further, sometimes you won't even get that shout.  So if you see someone
running past you and they zone out, get ready.  Of course if you see like 2
or more gnolls, aviaks, fire goblins, frogloks, greater kobolds,
LDC's....(ad infinitum) chasing someone get ready to bail.  You'll lose the
exp for the kill but trust me, dying is worse

-Grim
P.S. Start with these rules, but as experience grows,  you can handle
trains...later you grow to like them.  >:->
