Since your Dual Weild skill is currently almost nonexistant, the
damage output of your offhand weapon is really unimportant.
The thing is, dual weild is checked each time your offhand
weapon would cycle thru its delay, and you get your skill
check when this happens... fail or succede.  Only after you
make a successful dual weild check is your weapon skill
checked to see if you hit, and if you gain skill in that.

So what you want is the fastest possible weapon for your
off hand, until you get skill up in dual weild.

Of the above weapons, your best choice would be Elder
Owlbear Beak, since it gives you higher dex, and the
skill-up check is dex based.  But the 2 dex isn't really going
to make much difference, so I'd put the Fungusbeast Spine
there instead since you'll be more impressed with yourself
when it hits.

Honestly, though, I'd run out and pick up something
faster, with no regard at all for damage, say a gnoll hide
lariat.  Its not like you are going to see piercing skill ups
for quite a while based on your offhand.

In your main hand, use the Centi Shortsword unless for
some reason your damage output is unimportant, in
which case swap in the fungusbeast spine and put the
owlbear beak in the off hand, that way you'll train up
your piercing skills.
