Totally tangential to this topic but I can think of one future
exception to this from my experience on FV. Vah Shir beastlords will
be in pretty fair demand on a new server. Why? Because, judging from
FV, there will be no damn Vah Shir shaman and no one else on the moon
can heal (unless you count bards). :-)

A LOT of us on FV went with BL healing all the way to 20 or so. They
hated it. Every one of them wanted to be doing something else with
their mana. But Vah Shir shaman were so *rare* (not surprising really
since they can't use the best shaman piece of armor in the game) we
were all left with no choice. (I was Vah Shir warrior)

Then again maybe things have changed.
