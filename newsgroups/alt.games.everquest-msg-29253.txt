Incorrect. Please see Wolfie's post in this thread, which has the details and a
good link. You can't do *any* alchemy until level 25, and even then, you can
only have a max skill of five, no matter how much you practice. I do suppose
it's theoretically *possible* that you might eventually get a successful
combine for  a FOB potion with a skill of five, but at nearly 200 plat a crack
trying, you better be one rich Shaman to attempt it.
