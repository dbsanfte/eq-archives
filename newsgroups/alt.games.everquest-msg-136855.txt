Gee that must be it ! All this time I thought druids where underpowered but
it must just be my complete inability to play one. It is true that any idiot
can get to 60 and that is proven daily . Since I have 6 characters above 50
I must be 6 times the normal level of idiocy ! :)

It just could not be that I regret the waste of time leveling the druid. I
can not possibly be telling the truth when I mention friends long gone from
the druidic ranks and game. Why examine the evidence, when the poll results
are already in ! Everyone knows druids are the best at soloing and that
soloing is the one end all and be all ! Everyone knows that druids where
never parked at the dungeon entrance calling for hours for a group !

Ill take solace in knowing that my druid as badly as I play him could take
that sap encrusted branch you are so proud of and stick it where the sun
dont shine :p Of course dueling is not real important either ;)
