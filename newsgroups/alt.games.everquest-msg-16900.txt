Thanks, have`nt been killed yet but I have had my butt saved
by some guy who killed the big snake while I was lying there
bleeding to death and then bandaged me up.  Gotta learn about
these banadages.....   Did I say, I LOVE this game :-))

I cannot wait to get some decent leather armour and some scimitar that
is`nt rusty but it will all come in time I guess. Got to come to terms
with my mind set of being a Druid and cringe from killing wolves or 
else make the money some other way and buy the leather.
Trouble is everything seems to be so expensive, I think Norrath must
be having a period of inflation.

I will be moving around more now I have Gate but my big fear is
losing my corpse and the gear I have collected.

Good hunting.
