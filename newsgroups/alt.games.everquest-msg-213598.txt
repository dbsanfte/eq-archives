There are multiple types of AE spells -

Rains - these hit a max of 4 targets total
over a max of 3 waves.
EG - 1 mob will get hit 3 times
     2 mobs will each get hit twice
     3 mobs, each will get hit once, then one
    	 will get hit on the second wave
     4 mobs, each mob gets hit once

Pillar type spells - The standby for
quadding.  Hits 4 mobs (mostly) with a 
small radius of effect - targeted.

Point Blank AE - hits an unlimited 
number of mobs but only in a small radius
around the caster.  

Some spells break these general types,
but most ae nukes fall in there.

How you managed to miss the discussions on
the many drawbacks of rains (particularly for
magicians) over the last 3 years I couldn't
tell you :)

It used to be a mage's pet counted as one of
the targets.  Early on in EQ, the 2nd or 3rd
wave of a rain killing a mob could make it 
poof (no xp, no loot).  The fix to that made 
it so that (almost always) a mob below 10%
health resisted rains 100%.  They just changed
that, but there is a hard-coded secondary
resist of around 20%.

All that being said, alternating 2 rains yeilds
the highest DPS for the aggro that mages can 
manage
