Well, it could be your raidleaders aren't announcing what buffs to use.  
Many a time I've seen people be lax about this, and clerics saying, 
"should I MGB V or K?" and silence.  But nudge them.  suggest that it's 
important that you know you're on the right track with buffing strategy.  
If they say "uhh... I dunno... the clerics decide that."  Then decide, and 
tell them to announce that you're using 9/K or Virt as applicable.

It's good to have them announce when you're going to start generally 
buffing, too.  Sometimes it wakes up those /afk's who move back in range, 
and the latecomers put on a fresh head of steam to actually get there 
before all the MGB's go off.  "Buffs begin in 3 minutes! Shake a leg!" 
Ahh, dreamy. :)

Bah, they just got there too.  Sure, -you- saw them sitting there an hour, 
and they actually even moved, when the cat walked across the keyboard, but 
they got bored waiting on raid setup, and were down the street buying a 
fresh sixpack and pack of smokes. :)

And remember, someone misses buffs, that's generally not such a big deal.  
You're probably really better off saving the mana for healing, if it's 
the last minute like that.  I usually bug the clerics because I'm panicked 
about being behind schedule, but if they don't recast buffs for me, it's 
not their fault.  I'm only an enchanter, I shouldn't be drawing aggro to 
even -need- those buffs, and they only have a marginal effect on my 
survivability in most cases anyway.  The same goes for most of the raid 
except the tank lineup and pullers, barring massive aoe situations.
