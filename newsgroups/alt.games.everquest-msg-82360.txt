That bind spot in FM is a top candidate for the stupidest idea VI has
ever had (and we all know how crowded that field is). Anyone bound
there who pops up naked after dying is a sitting duck, especially a
non-druid or shaman. 

One poor warrior lost almost an entire level trying to get back to OT.
She died 3 times trying to get there. FM has wandering mobs everywhere
with no rhyme or reason so there's no avoiding them. Finally she
spotted me, a druid, and I got her through there safely. 

That bind spot is IDIOTIC.
