I'm just curious, would a newbie halfling rogue (who has both hide and
sneak as natural racial abilities) be able to travel from Rivervale to
Freeport and then from Freeport to Qeynos without any problems?

(And Jazzmanian Devil, I put your name in the title of the post
because I recall you saying you have a Brell-worshipping halfling
rogue you made for the sole purpose of doing corpse retrieval from the
Hole, and was wondering if you had any trouble on your journey from
Rivervale to the Hole)

Thanks in advance,
