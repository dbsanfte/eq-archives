I don't think I missed your point, I think you missed mine.  If people
wanted it in the past it would still be available.  If they want it in
the future it will become available.  Car manufacturers will make what
people want.  It's just that not enough people want the V6 to make it
profitable.  When enough do, they will make it.  Like I said, things
come full circle, always.

I gotta agree with hughs on this one, at least in regards to the
planet.  I think he's pretty much right.

As for culture, well that's another issue.  One that won't be changed
anytime soon.  I agree that there's no reason to buy something simply
because it's the biggest unless you really need that.  But our society
is (at least US society) focused on out-earning, out-buying, and
out-supersizing the next guy.  It's a Napoleonic thing I guess....

I just wanted a tank to keep my children safe.  And pull dune buggies
and horses.
