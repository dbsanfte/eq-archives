Don't know if she was the black widow type.  She was in two guilds that I
know of, and shortly after removing herself from the last guild, she changed
the 2 character names whom the guildies knew about.  Interesting?  Perhaps
not.  I remember her sending me a tell one night telling me her new
character names.  As I added them to friends, I asked her the reason for the
change.  "Doesn't a woman have the right to just change her mind?"  Yeah,
she liked to do that quite a bit.  /wink  After I pressed her a little more
the following night, she told me changing her names was a "polite way of
saying fuck off".  She was a sweety.

LMAO, I will keep this in mind for the future.  Thanks for your post.  =)
