Ack yes - went into auto mode and responded without checking the spec :(

Anyway I have finally cured my problem after further tests and it appears my
firewall software was to blame. I was using ZoneAlarm (unregistered verion).
I disabled it and have had no problems at all since - may be worth looking
at this area for your problem, if you use one.
