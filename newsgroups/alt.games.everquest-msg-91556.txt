Hey If you are going to Fay this is the method. 
GO to FV. Easy from Cabilis. Follow the right side of FV port where
you can see the boat. Thats where the zone from LOIO opens up. Go down
by the water becasue most spiders stay out of there.

When the boat zones in, swim to is and GET ON THE RUDDER. The rudder
in the back. After it zones into TD, it will stop at a elven outpost
island. You can swim out there and sneak onto the docks. There is a
shuttle there, when the next boat arrives ride that shuttle to the big
boat, I suggest you just sit on that shuttle until it moves. AFAIK no
elves will bug you after you get on that shuttle.

Then you ride the boat normally to the BB zone. When you zone into BB
jump off and swim to shore away from the port.
