Given the nature of Usenet and how the mildest statement will get
taken issue with, I obviously should have stated it more precisely:
"The number of people with an EQ *account* with a 50+ player....etc."

To have no clue how to get to Qeynos, unless you are roleplaying,
which the people I'm referring to quite obviously were not, you would
have to never have been there with *any* of your characters.

Someone zoned into SK from NK just recently and ran up to me on the
bridge.  "Is this the way to Qeynos?" she asked.

Now, I grant you, west Antonica is pretty much a backwater and I
usually only get that way these days if quests take me there.  Still.
Hasn't just about everyone started a character in Qeynos, Halas, or
Surefall Glade at least once?  Haven't many of these people made it as
far as West Karana?  Leveling an alt in WK recently I was amazed at
how often a shout of "How do I get to Qeynos?" rang out, which was
what originally provoked my comment.

Personally, I think it's a function of everyone getting their butts
ported everywhere these days.  West Antonica is one of the few places
where you actually have to hoof it for a few zones and I think it
confuses the hell out of the little darlings.
