After a interesting exchange with a clueless officer from an uber
guild, who insisted that I was not serving a guild enough, whatever
that means.

I have decided to lay down the law. After typing /guildremove I have
formed a guild that ANYONE can steal the name of and use on thier
server. If you take my name, which I have copylefted, you have to
agree with the following terms.

The name of the guild is Natoobah. I think I have constructed a system
that will force you to play and enjoy yourself.

1) Raids are limited to starting in Taverns in a newbie starting area.
Groups may be formed with or without guildmates as you wish. Every
level and class MUST be included if they wish. Raids may then spill
out to any raiding zone but everyone must have a full pack of some
adult beverage.  You get bonus points if you are drinking IRL as well.
If you are not of age, you should be in bed or something.

2) Anyone who agrees to act like a considerate person may join and
leave as they wish. There are no membership requirements. If you hate
the people you guild with, or like them you can decide if you want to
be a member.

3) Preferably, The sum of membership level of a particular level
should remain constant. Ideally, there should always be 60 1st levels,
30 2nd levels 20 3rds etc until you have one 60th level person. This
ensures that people concentrate on playing and NOT leveling.

4) Uber behavior of acting like an elite dork, complaing about loot
division, forcing lower level charactes to go anon, and telling others
they are forced people to raid is grounds for removal from the guild,
and cause for pelting with fire beetle eyes until they glow.

5) No member is bettter than any other member. All twinks are created
equal, they are endowed by thier twinker with certain phat lewts,
among those loots are the loots of fungi, centi and the pursuit of
experience.

6) All officers are drafted. If you want to be an officer, too bad.
You are disqualified. If you don't want to be an officer, and would
rather play and tradeskill, you are now an officer.

7) If you are going to ask for power levelling, it has to be donw by
people lower level than you. You have to be gather a number of lower
level people, give them goodies, and they can do the heals and stuff.
(Imagine a 40th level warrior being healed by 40-50 1st-5th level
Clerics so he can kill guards for XP)

8) If you dont like it fix it. If you dont fix it lump it. If you
can't lump it leave. If it's a good idea, then people will do it. If
you have to convincce people it really is a good idea, then it
probably isn't.

9) If you rise more than 5 levels in 5 hours you must walk across
Spectre Island in Oasis.  You are allowed to bring a PL party of lower
level characters, if you wish.

10) Guildmembers can actually get promoted to guildleader and grand
poobah if they can get a date with Lady Shae in Freeport. It has to be
an actual date with her, no going up to her room, thats too easy after
giving her a bunch of wine. You have to actually take her somewhere to
eat and maybe take in a show over by the Monk's guild. Bonus time if
the date ends with you running for the zone with her chasing you. Even
more bonus points if your real life mate catches you dating Lady Shae
(male or female) and you have to run for the zone in real life with
your mate chasing you with a frying pan.
