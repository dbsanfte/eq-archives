    Not terribly important on XP grind mobs - they get dropped fast. The
next point is a strong one for having a shammy slowing, though.

    I don't consider it to be a particularly resisted spell. The fact that
it CAN be resisted, at even the 10% to 15% level, would make me worry about
relying on it to save someone.

    That's off topic - XP grinding is less likely for a 60 shaman, and
having the time to Malo, Malosini, THEN Turgur to save someone seems
unlikely.

    No kidding. As far as I can tell all the aggro tables are back to what
they were before the CHeal nerfs. Sitting is STILL a mob magnet, debuffs
make the mobs call your name several times in a row ("You will not evade
me!"), and my CHeal isn't much more annoying to a live mob than before. It
might be getting me high on the hate lists of mezzed mobs waiting to die,
but since I MoK them before being woken up I can't distinguish between hate
sources.

    In my experience, having a good slower and a gimp healer just delays the
inevitable. I have yet to see the situation where if I'm OOM the shaman has
been able to take over as healer and keep a group in the action. Usually,
the shaman rapidly drops to OOM because even with laying Turgur on
everything (which in itself eats mana), he still can't keep up with his
small, low-effiency heals. The party is already at a sufficient health
deficit that heals are REQUIRED, not optional, and being forced to heal as
opposed to sit or wince drives them OOM.

>mob.

    I know. My favourite is sitting after catching aggro, swapping in Root,
and Rooting before the mob can swing. ;-)

    A little off. It took Turgur, Torpor, Malo/Malosini (did he use
Malosini? Not sure, don't think so), a lot of wincing, and damage from Dog
Dog, Epic, Bracer, AND a home-made damage shield potion to do it. Although I
bet you could remove some of those damage sources and he'd still win, ALL of
the setup spells for the "lock" are necessary. Saying it was mostly due to
Turgur ignores how absolutely necessary spells like Torpor were to achieving
this. Amazing the difference between a 59 and 60 shaman, when you think
about it. ;-)

    Answer: proximity. If the ENCH had mez resisted and mob went to him
first, it's likely staying on him. That's why I'm so in love with my stuns -
it gives me a chance to get between the ENCH and the mob if any difficulty
mezzing is encountered, so that my stuns and heals will count in the hate
race.

    If it's happening consistently, hell yes. I've told many a low-level
enchanter to "Go back to Karnor's" when they try to get groups in a place
like Sebilis, because I've seen the results. They deny me mana by not having
C2, they waste my med time standing to save them, and they waste my mana by
healing them more than I should. But it DOES happen that sometimes when two
tough mobs come in, that first mez is resisted.

    Been there on a two group "XP raid". Loads of fun, especially with the
wall aggro occasionally causing wonderful "train to medding caster" effects.
The pace is great, and getting a part of your key is just gravy. ;-)
