I found this on a google search .....

<snip>

Best way that I've found to get EQ to run better on my machine was with
/viewport.

Say you are running the game at 1600x1200
/viewport 50 50 1024 760

It creates a 1600x1200 black background and shrinks the window that EQ is
displayed in to 1024x768 and places the upper left corner (0,0) at 50,50 of
your monitor resolution window. If you did that, you'd have some big black
blank spaces on the right and bottom of your screen. What I do is move all
my chat and data windows into that space so now I have, albiet a smaller
resolution, but 100% uncluttered view of the world. It just so happens that
this also makes it so the video card is really only pushing a 3D rendered
world that's 1024x768.
