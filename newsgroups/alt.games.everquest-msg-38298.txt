TCC will be a non event. Just as no switch led to a user base in UO that was
mostly in favor of no switch, you can't judge current market tastes based on
current user base in EQ.

Specifically, you have people continuing to play the game because they LIKE
the way it works NOW. TCC is not for the current user base, it is for the
people that have either quit the game in disgust over the high level
characters camping low level mobs or don't buy the game based on its
reputation.

VI is not really taking away so much as trying to appeal to a wider
marketing demographic. All the camping you have come to know and love with
the addition of TCC.

More like Whooooooooops! IMO. Namely that the work arounds and exploits will
be probably figured out on TC before the main servers are patched. It will
in all likelyhood be business as usual. The game still won't appeal to a
different market segment and there will be some of the usual wags such as
LtM blasting the buggy implementation. Characters having to lose levels or
experience to complete quests kind of thing.

Its not that VI doesn't want to get it right, just that they can't when
faced with the current user base.
