  Okay, how?

  You notice somebody is looking at your shoes.  Something goes off in your
brain telling, "Hey, this guy is looking at my shoes."  This is the function
that game messaging is supposed to provide, it tells you when your character
notices something happening that might not be readily apparent because of
the limits of the graphics engine.

  I don't think so.  Lots of people have no problem with it.  Some people
just get annoyed by the smallest, silliest things.  I mean, think of why
people are really inspecting you... they're not doing it to annoy you,
because frankly there are far more effective ways of annoying someone...
especially since we've been given the option to turn off inspection
notification.  They're either doing it because they're curious about your
equipment, or because they want to see what you have written in your little
character description box (which some people actually use for things other
than writing stupid things about how they've been wronged by being
inspected), or they're curious what the name of that neat looking shield and
sword are and don't want to impose on you to ask when you might be busy with
something else (or they are just shy), or they accidentally right-clicked
you.  How are any of these things even REMOTELY annoying?  Is it just the
WORDING that annoys you?  Come on, get over it... and if you're really going
to let it bother you, blame Verant, they're the ones who decided on the
wording.

  No, it's not.  It's like noticing someone looking at your shoes.  The
messaging is not "Soandso tells you that he is inspecting your equipment."

  In my opinion, it's bad form to try make others feel as if they need
permission for something that doesn't affect you at all.  If it bothers you,
you can turn off the messaging.  If it doesn't, you can keep it on.

  Boggling, but no more boggling than wanting to be asked to be inspected.
Neither effect you, and you don't notice either of them if you don't want
to.  I don't really see any difference.
