I have had to switch weapons before because the Knight in the group could
not hold agro with me.  Maybe the issue here is who can hold agro and keep
it.  In groups I have been in that were successful groups, the Knights held
their stuns until a Caster caught agro, then a quick stun and things were
back on track.  Using a Greatstaff of Thunder 2-hander I Can pull agro off
of a MT Knight.  Was doing just that the other day without taunting the mob.
When it became clear that the group needed a MT that could hold agro
consitently I switched to my Windblade.  Agro became a non-issue after that.
But we also had more downtime since the Kinght was requiring more heals from
the cleric than when I was MTing.

But hey, the game is slanted towards casters anyway.  I have read where the
developers are working on increasing the damage capabilites of melees since
they have fallen far behind their finger-wiggler firends.  Frankly, I hope
that more hate producing warrior weapons are introduced onto the market.  If
we were holding this discussion around a Warrior using a Blade of Carnage
that drops off the Avatar of War then the who can hold agro better would
become mute.
