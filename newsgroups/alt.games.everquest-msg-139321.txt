These spells are diety based, by the way, so you can only ever
mem one (there was a time when this was broken, so there
are some casters who have a whole slew of them memmed)

As a halfling, I assume you worship Karana, which means you
can learn Imbue Plains Pebble

Plains Pebbles are foraged in the various Karana zones, and
are droppable but don't stack.  Imbued ones, though, are
stackable.

There is a rumor that Imbued Plains Pebbles in your inventory
will cut in half your rate of eating and/or drinking.  I can't say.

They are also used in jewelry and perhaps some forms of
tailoring or smithing, I think to create items usuable only
by Karana worshippers.

They are probably most heavily used now in creating
Solstice Robes, part of the quest for Protection
of the Cabbage, a 59 druid spell, the quest also yields
a great all/all earring, and a great druid only earring.
