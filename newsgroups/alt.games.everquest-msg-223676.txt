I've been playing the game on the Stromm server for almost 2 months. 
In that time I've played a level 23 human necro, 20 barbarian warrior,
and a 14 high elf cleric.  I've had the advantage of my wife playing
online by my side, she's a 22 barbarian beastlord and 21 wood elf
druid.  We've mostly done Everfrost Peaks, Blackburrow, Greater
Faydark (orc hill), Crushbone, Kurn's Tower, and recently Paludal
Caverns.  She's gotten into the tradeskills and leaves her "merchant"
in the Bazaar when we're not playing (thanks cable modem!).  If not
for her, I'm not sure how I would fund my necro.

Here's just a few things I've observed:

- It would seem that some of the newbie armor quests are darn near
impossible to complete due to the rarity of some components and the
number of people camping said components.  Once I clicked the funny
looking book on a pedastal, the newbie armor didn't matter anymore. 
In short time, we had aquired more than enough platinum to buy better
gear in the Bazaar.  This was unfortunate because it was pretty fun
trying to get the stuff the hard way as I struggled to get used to the
game.  My necro got really bored camping for giant king snake skins
when there was better experience and loot to be had elsewhere.  I
wouldn't have minded if the items where spread out on creatures that
needed me to be 20th level, but I got to a point where it wasn't worth
the time.

- Some of the quests leave me wondering, WTF?  By the time by
barbarian warrior found enough of those Wrath Orc Wristbands, the
reward (the Saex) was pretty subpar for his level.  Maybe you had to
be playing EQ from the start to appreciate such rewards.

- The different languages aren't really useful, at least so far that
I've found.  As cool as it is to be able to switch to another
language, it kinda seems wasted since everyone has Common.  It would
have been interesting to have to learn new tongues.  I suppose that
sort of makes grouping as newbies difficult.

- The system of practice runes for spell research seems kinda broken. 
So far it seems cheaper (money and time wise) to either dump training
points into it or buy words from the Bazaar and raise the skill.  Even
buying the already made spells from the Bazaar seems to be cheaper
than hunting down all the components to make the practice runes.  I
have mixed feelings on this, since somedays I like improving skills by
questing, and somedays I'll just slap down the plat and call it good. 
Much like home repair in real life :).

- NPC's could stand to be chattier.  I always pause when I see one
talking without being hailed first, which really adds a lot of flavor
to the world.  I kinda get a kick out of figuring out how to talk to
them to get the quests, especially when they don't make it so
[obvious].  I have to give EQ credit for not using the old standby
menu system to interact with NPC's that most RPG have.

- The Plane of Knowledge and the Bazaar almost make things too easy as
a newbie.   Now that I've been playing a while I can see druids are
sore about the PoK portals, since it must have been much more
difficult to travel.  And the Bazaar, well, it's almost too perfect of
a market mechanic.  On the other hand, the PoK is great for friends
that roll up characters on different continents to get together
quickly.  And the Bazaar is good for newbies to get started with some
sweet gear for cheap.

- LDoN looks neat, but it almost seems like too much instant
gratification.  I'm afraid if I buy it, I'll be in bad like I was with
Diablo II.  Right now, I'm still in the explorer mode with EQ, and
would hate to ruin that experience.

- Lastly, something I learned the hard way: don't "decloak" in front
of the Iksar city guards as a human necro, just to see if they are
still indifferent when you are visible.
