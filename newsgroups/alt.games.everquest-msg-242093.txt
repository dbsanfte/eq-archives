Terrific work, a few suggestions below:

Kunark,

Lost

New players or people considering trying it are generally aware that EQ has
had a steady stream of expansions as well as patch alterations, and they
always ask me, "Overall how has the game changed overall?" They mean in the
developers' overall direction -- is it more group-oriented now than at
release, is it harder/easier to be a newbie, how has the death penalty
evolved, etc. It's a logical question when considering a new game that
you've heard/read is "constantly evolving."

So maybe adding that question and a two-paragraph summary answer would be
worthwhile. Very broad -- just a quick general consensus on how the game has
changed overall. If it would be helpful I could take a first stab at such an
answer, just shoot me an email.

You might want to add in the instructions for creating additional chat
windows and directing certain things to each of them. I can't imagine
managing any autojoined chat channels if they were still all going into the
single default chat window with the battle spam and so forth.



One more thing: unless I missed it, a section with a few basic questions
about player guilds would be useful. (Starting with clarifying that a player
guild is different from a character's class guild where you train skills
with the guildmaster).
