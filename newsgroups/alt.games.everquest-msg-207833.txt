Regardless of the answer to your question, I'll point out one thing my 
druid observed:

Plains Pebbles don't stack
Imbued Plains Pebbles stack.

So, would you rather have 2 10 slot bags full of Plains Pebbles, or one 
slot filled with a stack of 20 Imbued Plains Pebbles?

Also, imbues take mana.  Imbues in large healthy chunks like most trade 
skills require take significant amounts of mana.  In general, buying pre 
imbued items means saving a significant amount of time for the trade 
skiller, even if he -can- do the casting himself, he's probably willing 
to pay a premium for the pre imbued product instead.

You, on the other hand, can imbue them one at a time as you get them, 
and probably will in order to save space.
