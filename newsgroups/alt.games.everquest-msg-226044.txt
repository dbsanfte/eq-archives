I got run3 and regen 3 at 51, and then ran for 65, since then I have
got another 20 AAs so.. its deffinately bull. (Im not a cleric btw)

The other advantage to doing it when you hit 65 is some of the last
tab you can do at 65 with no prerequisits so, you can just do those
first if they are interesting. Its only the first 4 tabs you need to
do in order. (Some on the last tab do have requirements but not all)

Plus, as Richard has said, at 65 you have the world before you, your
spells are at their best (bar AA improvements), your AAXP will come in
as fast as you can count, I got 4 AAs yesterday by doing 8 LDoN
missions.

The only thing that can get frustrating with AAs is that you maybe
buying from the 3rd (class) tab and first point maybe 3 aa's, 2nd 6
and third is 9.. so you need 18 aas to complete.. It can feel like a
LONG time
