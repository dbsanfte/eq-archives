Well I suppose so, tho I've done 4 trips with my 54 BST and not had any
problems along those lines. I've won the rolls at trip end for two nice
wearable items so far, one of them a haste item much drooled over. Gone 1
for 4 on the actual goals, the win got me 15 points. Still learning but much
enjoying it.

One more thing I'll add: on my server a couple of us are trying to establish
a general practice of an all-server "LDON" chat channel. It seems an
obviously useful thing if people get into the habit. It's another way to
find or form groups quickly across zones (I do also use the LFG tool), and
people are trading info and tips as we all explore LDoN and learn about it.
And Lance's story makes me think of another use: a place to report people
who act like that SK did.

Since I am mostly doing LDoN stuff right now I've done "/autojoin LDON"
meaning I join the channel automatically whenever I log on to EQ. Highly
recommended if you can get the channel established as a practice on your
server.
