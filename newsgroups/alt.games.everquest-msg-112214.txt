o.k listen up dill weed, you isnt making any sence.. yes you do get a
free 30 days after you purchase the game,   i dont have a job
  i dont know how to spell. well whoopy-do, am i suppose to try using
proper grammar or something?    i better not make more than one
mistake per sentence or im royaly screwed.   well fug you. you ugly
bastards have no life,
thats all i can do is sit there in mama's basement and fling boogers
up at the ceiling and googling naked women on your internet   you guys
will get laid in your life,     youll never have it as good as ultima
online cause youll continue to support such a off beat service such
asan on--line game company, 
dont be a arsehole... get a life... dont spend your hard earning money
on an on-line game like Ultima Online when all your doing is feeding
the trolls (who are the programmers of this game) why should one have
to pay anyways? fuck them... games should be free... lazy bastards, if
one buys the damn game, it should be free, no strings attached... so
while you wack you tiny peters off on a female just remember that
female could be a man, a man that could be the creater of this game...
dont be a dummy... dont support an on-line game like Ultima Online. or
again your gay! the end!
