Nope. Granting 2000+ players at a time on a server the ability to
querie any zone at any given moment creates potential lag problems.
The game would actually have to load information fromt he zone, and a
bunch of bored jerks might figure out and macro to do a /who for
several different zones in rapid fire. At the rate a macro could spit
out the requests, a few people doing that could cause serious server
problems.
