Well, for one thing, a level 1 player can fall and take 10,000
points of damage.  He'll die, but that's what he'll see as the
damage taken.   Hitting for 512 is something else, of course.

You're playing EQ right if you're having fun.   "Fun" only requires
matching yourself up against yourself and your own expectations,
not anyone else.

Don't know.   Are you having fun?

Whatever for?  Sure, higher-levels get different spells, hit
for more points, whatever.   So?   What makes EQ fun to
me is the journey, and the learning involved, not the mindless
rush to level so I can get somewhere else.   Ultimately, what
matters if you hit for 59 against mobs with 1500 HP or 590
against mobs with 15000 HP?   That 1500 HP is only hitting
you for 40.  That 15000 HP mob is hitting them for 400.  It's
simply a matter of degree.   What does change, though, is
that the endgame mobs are something you'll *never* have the
accomplishment of killing by yourself.   That's something you
have, now.    Seems a trade-off to me; individual accomplishment
vs. group accomplishment.   Even at 33, I can take on white
mobs solo, and with good tactics, win.   I don't expect I'll do
that at 60.   And I think I'll miss that.  Chain CHealing tanks in
endgame encounters better be a *lot* of fun.
