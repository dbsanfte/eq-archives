It's a clever name for a way to fight a MOB. One typical example is
that you make sure you have a fresh SOW, then you cast either a DOT or
a Direct Damage spell on the MOB. Then you start running, making sure
to stay far enough ahead that you can turn and inflict more of the
same sort of damage as needed.

So, you're running along, with this MOB trailing behind you like a
kite in the wind, hence the name.

You may optionally snare the MOB, or even kit multiple MOBs at once.

It's a bit dull (until something goes wrong) but undeniably effective.
