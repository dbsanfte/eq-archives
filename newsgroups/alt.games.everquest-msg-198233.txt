The test server is a seperate thing entirely...  If you go to Everquest via
your start menu, it should give you 3 options...  Everquest, Everquest Tutorial
and Test Everquest...

That last one is the one you're looking for.  If you haven't regularly patched
that bad boy with each patch, I believe you will be patching for quite
awhile... LOL  I was going to log onto Test myself tonight and then realized I
hadn't patched it.  Said forget it and just logged onto the game.

Good luck!
