I'd rather call YOU a design flaw. That's the dumbest statement I ever
heard (not really, but its up there).

Anyone can get the lowest horses. They aren't all that expensive.

Funny, I've seen several and I have almost all the graphics turned

An outright lie.

No, its not like that at all.

You, sir, are an idiot. They should have left you in the abortion vat.
