Extreme infatuation with a computer game to the point where reality 
seems trivial in comparison, where the events of the computer game in 
this player's mind have such a profound psychological effect on his mind 
that he decides dealing with it is just too hard, and ending his life is 
the better solution.

This is of course assuming that somehow his playing Everquest lead him 
to kill himself. It seems to me there are *many* other reasons why this 
person would decide to kill himself. Perhaps his parenting, social life, 
drinking water or the weather of the day. Who knows what went through 
his head?

He probably had psychological problems to begin with as I have suggested 
above, and these psychological problems lead to his suicide. Not EQ or 
Sony or his ISP or his computer manufacturer. To me it seems that 
blaming EQ and suing Sony is simply inspired by greed more than anything 
else.

Because killing yourself to avoid dealing with reality does not seem 
rational to me.

Yes but you are the one who suggested EQ could be responsible, so I 
assumed you had a reason why.

Nope. The governments should adjust the laws to limit this sort of 
nonsense where people immediately look for someone to sue in the advent 
of a tragedy.
