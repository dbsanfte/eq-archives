   Ok. So they should go to jail. Over night, just to cool down. 
Clearly, less severe than going to jail for a week, month, or even
years.  But... going to jail is still going to jail, no?  Even if it is
only overnight.

   This is as clear an answer to the question directly above it as
anyone could hope for.  No, they do not go to jail.  There seems to be a
contradiction in what you are saying in this post.

   I guess, and it is only a guess, that you are saying that you believe
that while they should go to jail, if it were up to you, you wouldn't
actually send the order to round them up.  If that is the case, are you
saying that things that should be done are better not being done?  Or
are you saying that someone else ought to handle the details of getting
them done so you don't dirty your hands?  Maybe there's a third or
fourth answer I'm not thinking of, because I'm a bit confused at this
point.

   Maybe instead of arguing whether anyone in the country has ever been
incarcerated without having broken a law, we might do better to discuss
what the word "should" means.
