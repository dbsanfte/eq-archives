   I am agnostic.  I knew it meant that I wouldn't be able to wear 
certain types of armour (culture imbuded?  Didn't think there would
be tons of that available to gmomes anyways) and maybe other equipement
as well.  But I figured there would still be tons of other stuff to
wear, especially what with dwarves being such a popular warrior choice.
Looking at you screenshots, I see I was right.  I particullary look 
forward to getting my crafted.  I found the screenshots to be 
especially interesting, since my gnome is also a female (as are all
my characters).

   So far the worst I've had is people running up to me and telling me
I'm
short.  I tell them they're tall and hug their legs.  I was a group the
night before last.  I was the main puller, but we had a few eager
beavers
who would occasionally run out for stuff as well.  The cooler heads in
the
group grew tired of this, and put it to a vote as to who the puller
should
be.  I won hands down.  Everyone, even the other pullers, accepted
"Teatank
is the best puller" as a statement of fact.

Not just for gnomes, but still good to know.  Right now I'm mainly
working
on raising my 2 hand skills, since I figure that once I do get dual
wield, 
I'll have a hard time forcing myself to work on them.  I do find that my
skill increases are coming alot faster than they did when I played a
barb,
and I should imagine alot fast than any of the other popular warrior
choices, save maybe dwarf.

  Very cool.  Can't wait to run across one of those giant skellis
myself.  I've not been to most of the zones you show, but I look 
forward to going.
