 Heh. One of ours brought an entire live robin in once. We managed to 
intervene before any physical harm was done, and we caught the bird and 
released it into the back yard. It just kind of sat there on the lawn for 
about half an hour before finally taking off. I could just see the 
thought going through its tiny little head: "FUUUUUUUUUUUCK!"

I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
