This happened a few months ago when I was with a group in CC at the
genoids.  I guess a group had already been there.  They complained but
we left.  I did mention that if they had a problem with the one genoid
we killed (which was the Gem Collector) to go ahead and petition so we
could plead our case.  Of course, he had NO case to warrant a petition
so he just grumbled and sent an OOC "warning" other players about us. 
Funny thing is that we were the only other players in the zone.

That was when I didn't think the hallway could be considered a camp. 
After reading the other replies to my question, it seems to be
considered a camp across all servers so I won't do that again.
