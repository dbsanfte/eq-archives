Actually, it might not.  I had to use a different computer
once and had all but my Luclin CD to install on it (account
registered for all expansions).  Nothing extra was downloaded
for the missing expansion... I simply couldn't log into any
character that was in a Luclin zone.

Was a real hassle, lemme tell ya.  :/  Which sorted itself out
when we got the EQ computer back up and running.
