Hate to tell you "max" but it does state on the box that it requires a
credit card.  And another thing, even if they said "No Credit Card Required"
You still couldn't get them with a lawsuit, because having a credit card
isn't required.  I don't have one, and yet I can play using the good ol'
Game Card that I bought at Electronics Boutique.  So stop your bitching and
whining and go back to surfing the net for porn.

failed, they have never tried.
