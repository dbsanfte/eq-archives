Well, to belabor it just a bit more, EQ was never really "done". There 
did come a point when Brad and others merely decided to go "do something 
else".

The only difference is that before, EQ was already owned by SoE, so their 
departure was clean and simple. With Vanguard, Sigil would have a 
property at stake. Their decision would simply be to either sell it and 
move on or continue development on Vanguard and use it to fund their next 
project. The amount of sense selling would make would then be directly 
proportionate to the amount of money SoE would be willing to offer - if 
they wanted it, of course.
