Sorry, didn't phrase that well.

In OT there are the low cons (30-33ish)
Stoneleer Cockatrices/Sabertooth tigresses/
Sarnak Berserkers/Thorny Succulents

and High cons (34-38) Stonegazer/Tigers/
Knights/Spiked  and Kunark rhinos seem
to run 33-35 ish

So, still blue (the best tigress is still a
handful solo, and gives over half a
blue).  It's just that with 2 minor
conjuration: water and 3 true melee types
(30-35) on them, the lower set doesn't
last long enough to need a nuke.

Personally I think he's a mage who's too
used to soloing, since that type of over
nuking is more typical of solo mages
in my experience.
