Outside of the obvious effect that a swarm kiter has? Your play style
as part of the "society" of Everquest affects the mobs available,
affects the economy, and affects the number or type of classes to play
with. One level 14 warrior with a Fungi Tunic and or a 70 druid
babysitter can monopolize the mobs, as well as decreasing the number of
available tanks for grouping. (You have obviously never seen a selfish
powerleveler or group trying to take every mob in a low level zone.)

You need to look at the bigger picture as well. 100 powerleveller
twinks is 100 fewer people with any use for low level items, low level
grouping, anything but low level mobs in fact. You can argue if you
like that that behavior is okay, but you can't argue that it doesn't
impact others directly and indirectly. It usually has some benefits as
well as negatives, of course, but that doesn't change the fact that it
changes the overall dynamic of the game.
