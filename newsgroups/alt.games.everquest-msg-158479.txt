Its pretty cheap on sony's part imo. I dont mind buying expansions for extra
content, that how it should be. When I have to buy expansions just so I can
keep going raiding in zones I have raided many times before... well thats
pretty much the same as "You buy our expansion, or we'll fuck up your game".
Not sure that I want to outlay all that money on 2 copies of an expansion
for a game this old. I would have just liked to continue playing without PoP
for now, but without raid that really isnt an option. This may not be the
last "expansion" either, maybe number 5 is coming, and if we dont buy that
too, we'll be screwed.
