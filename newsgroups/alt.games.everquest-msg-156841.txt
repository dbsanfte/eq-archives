    After going to Cazic Thule and watching my nukes get resisted in a big
way in Planks, why do I feel that Lull will still suck?

    Divine Aura is the best of the personal invulnerability spells, and it's
level 1. When are you going to nerf that, EQ Expert? Harmony isn't a spell
line, it's a single spell. It's not unusual for a single utility spell to be
useful for a lengthy period of time.

    Design can compensate for any player ability. Take your Harmony problem
in CT. Possible solutions include:

(1) Selective flagging of mobs as "no Harmony" to ensure all initial pulls
from certain areas are multiple-pulls.
(2) Using geometry and aggro radius to force players to engage mobs before
they have a chance to cast Harmony.
(3) Upping respawn rate such that a group pulling mobs singly to camp (as
opposed to pulling multiples and mezzing) could not clear past certain areas
to where desirable loot-dropping mobs spawn.
(4) Increased use of wanderers in areas where Harmony can be used, so all
fights will get adds whether it is used or not.

    It's quite easy, if you try!

    THEN TUNE THE ENCOUNTERS TO TAKE HARMONY INTO ACCOUNT! /sigh

    So you've weakened Harmony-casting classes, and strengthened (in theory,
perhaps not in practice) Lull-casting classes. What other changes will be
done to restore relative balance to the classes affected? I doubt any
developer ever counted Lull as something useful a cleric does, nor do I
imagine outdoor camps that druids solo were balanced for druids without
failsafe Harmony.
