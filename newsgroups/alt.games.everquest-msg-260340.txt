Have you tried one yet?

I haven't done any since coming back, (I'm sure they're much easier now) but
I remember them well from the beginning of PoP.   We tried every last one,
in an attempt to avoid the lines at Executioner, which were 6 or 7 groups
deep.  All of them were an order of magnitude harder than Executioner.

I'm sure a group of all 65's in todays equipment can probably get past them
pretty easily... but I'm not so sure they could do that while carrying
people who are not contributing.

Would be worth attempting if you're just sitting there waiting... but I'm
not quite as sure as you seem to be that it would have surely resulted in
any more completed flags.

Probably just bad planning.   They most likely went in with great intentions
of "Woo! we'll do this over and over again, just churn them out... 4 trials
and we're done!"...  and then after the second, one of the key people PL'ing
people through them decided they'd had enough, and just didn't have the
paitence for more waiting.

Yep.  Was kind of silly to have everyone waiting, rather than just telling
them to be ready to show up when it was thier turn.

And if they're hitting off the AA crackpipe, they may still be 55.   But
with FT3 to show for it! =/

Um... no.

I was most definitely level 65 before ever setting foot in Valor and Storms.
As were my friends.    Average equipped people, as opposed to uberguilders,
were not getting past trials with a group of lower levels.  With the spells
/ buffs / equipment available then, trials sucked.  Hard.   (Especially
since it took them a couple months to finally fix the boss so he really did
mitigate slow, instead of just being unslowable with a mitigated message.)


(Plane of Nightmare, the mephits are incredible experience to level 64, and
the hobgoblin horrors to 65.)

Fair enough.  But PoJ trials is a separate case.   Unless your guild is
actively working on killing LMM, theres no reason at all it can't be put off
until level 65, where you can actually contribute to the group, rather than
receiving the flag as charity.
