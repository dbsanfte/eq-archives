What I say - boooring - worst expansion ever,some lines are even
worse than their predecessors(Pacify-Harmony line,and only 1 stun 
working on level 70 mobs,where we had 2 stuns working when the
max level was 65).
Another terrible effect of all the higher numbers is,that newbies are
hurt by it much,making it almost impossible to catch up with the older
players,but I guess SOE wants newbies go to WoW,not EQ.  =)
