If you're still around Oggok go in & find the potion vendor.  He/she will
also sell Chipped Bone Rods which have either 3 or 5 charges of Locate
Corpse.  Buy a few of them.

Go to WC and auction for a ride to DL.  Once you get there (you must have
SoW) go SE to the ice tunnel.  Go invis...some things see through it, but
not everything (I assume a 19 SK has it but I don't know).

Once you get thru the ice tunnel, target yourself & right-click on the rod
(it must be in a general inventory slot, NOT in a bag) and you will be
turned towards your corpse.  Invis up again and run that way.  When you
think you are close cast it again, get invis, and start running again.

Remember NOT to loot your corpse where you died...after all, you KNOW that
critters wander there.  Most zone walls around there should be safe.  Even
better would be for you to go back to the druid ring area and loot there.

Then get a ride back to NRo/SRo/WC and take the boat.  It's a hell of a run
from DL to OT (closest bind point for you) at level 19.

I'm not on Trib, sorry. :(
