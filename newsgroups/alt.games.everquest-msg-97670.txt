So I understand.

He has just corrected me.  'Singasong' is the only one he tried.

I would not have guessed correctly at the time; now I know.

He explained to me why he was compelled to keep submitting the
name.  I have a character named Hugashrub.  He pointed out that
both names are of the same form -- verb + article + noun  -- and it
seemed inconsistent to him that mine was okay but his was not.  He
is a very logical boy, and was eager to find out about this.

Daddy didn't know the details of this rule.  I hope you don't mean
this as a generalization.  I teach my kids all sorts of rules, and other
things.  Right now I am teaching him about usenet.     :-)

He is nearly 12, but that's rather beside the point, for me.  I tend
to judge games and such on an individual basis, as opposed to by
particular ratings, though I do use ratings as a guideline.  For example,
I have on three occasions taken him to see PG-13 movies, though he
is not yet 13.  Each time I first paid to go see the movie first, then
again a second time with him.

I play together with him, look at logs when he's played without me,
engage the naughty-language filter, thank people for having played
nicely with him when it's time to quit, and so on.  Be assured that I
am an extremely involved parent.

> your eyes...

Actually, this is quite far off the mark, and may be what prompted
him to say "e-mail her at comcast dot net and tell her she's a bad
lady."  I told him no she's not.  At worst it was rude of her to make
some negative assumptions.  Oh, now he says he was joking and
doesn't really mean it.  He's a good boy; just got a little protective,
I guess.

Now he's asking how I think she'll respond.  As I said, I am teaching
him now about usenet.  I've told him that folks often speak in ways
they would not, if they were face-to-face.  I've also told him that
most people are good, just like in EQ.  Unless your response is not
positive, which would surprise me, I will share it with him.

Just in case anyone is still concerned about how protective I am or
am not of my son, though I would take him to see LotR, or let him
play EQ unattended, he will not venture into all of usenet on his
own anytime soon.

Forgive the long, defensive message, please.
