At 200 skill your tunnel vision is lowered to the lowest form, so you 
can actually navigate, and the swaying stop around 1/4 sec after you 
stop moving. I got my last 25 points in alcohol tolerance in Kelethin, 
and was actually able to run to the store and get more booze without 
falling down.
This means that you can cast spells, although not as many, since you 
still get the Wis penalty.
But i can still see the fun in duelling a drunk warrior, use my armor to 
snare, root, and dot, and then actually be able to cast nukes.
