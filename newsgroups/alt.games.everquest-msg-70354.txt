You are blind then, Final Fantasy and its story are just presented in a
different way thanks to technology.

They used pre-rendered background cause they can, and it was very effective.
They used FMV cut scenes to show more emotion that real time could not. When
you played all those Final Fantasy games on the SNES, you always have these
little cut scenes using the game engine cause they couldn't fit a whole FMV
scene in a cartridge. FF has always had many cut scenes, they where just
replaced using FMVs on the PSone.
