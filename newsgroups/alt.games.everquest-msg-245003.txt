No. No. No. You are viewing it from the perspective of someone who is 
trying to cram the most benefit from a limited time period. The reality 
for someone on this server would be 'the time limit isn't a limit'... 
they aren't going to hit it anyways, they simply don't play that much.

That's a valid point. I would expect the populations to be lower... and 
grouping could be more of a challenge... maybe. The social dynamics 
would be quite different... I think the casual crowd is more easy 
going... there may be fewer people to choose from... but most of them 
would be pretty laid back. I you did a who 35 and found 9 people...most 
of them would be available to play with I'd think... you wouldn't find 
that 8 of them are multi-box-PLing alts.

A 3-boxer who can only play 10 hours a week? Who would pay that kind of 
money and log in that little?

In theory yes... a hard core raider would have less competition for 
mobs... but what hardcore raider plays 10 hours a week? By definition he 
wouldn't be hardcore!! No hardcore raiders should even be on the server...

It does raise the point that some 'hardcore' group might take it as a 
'challenge' to 'be the best' on a casual server... and min-max their 
time period to PL and raid etc... but I don't know. I don't really see 
it happening. They're going to want to play more, and their is really no 
point in deliberately hobbling yourself with a time limit.

If there is a demand for that ... run a ladder server, and let guilds 
'race' for six months. Declare a winner, x-fer the characters to their 
normal unlimited servers... and then reset the ladder...

The only people who would gravitate to the casual servers are those for 
whom the time limit is not the bottleneck on their play time.

I'd propose...multiple tiers... a 40 hours a month server. An 80 hours a 
month server... and unlimited hours a month servers.

Per my comments, do you revise this opinion at all?

Actually I'd have switched titles a while ago already if I could bring a 
few friends with me. At this point I'd rather play EQ with X, than AO 
without... but I'm winning them over slowly... :) Plus WoW is 
coming...its going to at least get a serious evaluation.
