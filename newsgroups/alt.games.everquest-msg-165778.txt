That's the main reason when I play my druid is spare time. Soloing does
afford a quick half hour romp.
Just some more ideas to throw at ya seeing as you haven't played in a bit.
Take up a tradeskill.
Make a checklist of quested or no drop gear you want.
Make a list of zones you have never seen and bank all your gear and go
wandering-not great for exp and in fact I usually get neg exp. But exp is
easy to get and dieing sooner due to exploring is less of a loss than later.
Groups in dungeons can be hard to find at times but DS snare root and back
up healer regen resists buffs is always good. Remember to ensnare every mob
as soon as chanter mezzes. Doesn't break mez and gets aggro to you.
And there is always the option of making an alt. -- I have and play too many
err wait -- I want more than 8 slot darnit !.

Have fun. Die happy. Live fast.
