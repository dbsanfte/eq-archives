I agree totally, and most groups don't *NEED* clerics either.  Many
exp grind groups can do fine with a Shaman or Druid playing healer.
Both classes fill that slot fine right now, as is.

Druids don't have a 'different' utility, they have ALL the utilities.
Heal, nuke, buff, debuff, and crowd control.  They're just not the
best at any of it.

In high end raid encounters you will no see a Paladin as MT.  In
normal exp groups, Pallies make fine MT's though.  So do
Shadowknights.  Just like Druids, in normal exp groups, CAN make
perfectly good healers.  Can they fill the role as well as a cleric?
Nope.  But with they're overwhelming bag of tricks, they shouldn't be
able to either.

Life is a bitch sometimes.  You have to learn to work with what you
have.  That's exactly the kind of thing that makes players GOOD
players other than button mashers.

There ARE three "healer" classes.  Clerics are the best, while druids
and shaman trail behind by a fair margin I admit.  But they make up
for that by being able to do other things.
