In my experience App IIs are kind of a waste, just skip right to App IIIs or 
Adepts soon as you can find and afford them.

Yes, you can skip over any of the intermediate steps and scribe the highest 
level spell that your skills will support. In my experience the skill 
requirements are pretty lenient so that if you have a spell to begin with, 
you're very likely to be able to scribe any upgrade to it, all the way to 
Adept III and maybe even Master.
