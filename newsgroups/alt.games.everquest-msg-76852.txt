Geez .. I would be so *extremely* happy to see a kill yield half a blue

Well I don't know druids, but I really doubt 27 is ready for Velious, not
past Iceclad anyway. Maybe you can form some snow cougar group. But For
Rygorr in EQ, Bears in GD or Giants anywhere, you're just too small. For
soloing anyways. I'd wait with velious till you're 35 or so to really
start enjoying. At 27, Kunark OT should be excellent exp for a starter,
though, at least in ther northern/northeastern regions (OT gets harder
clockwise, starting with about the NW corner/Dock). It's also known as
druid heaven (very flat, spacey, separated mobs etc).
