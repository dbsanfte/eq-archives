Well I'd feel your pain, but I'm still numb from this:

I get a tell asking if I can res.  I give /loc for person to bring
corpse to my group but he gets killed trying to get there.  Sends me
another tell demanding that I come to zone line to res both of his
corpses.  I am grouped with friends of mine who happen to be in his
guild so I tell him to hang on I am asking his guildmates if they like
him enough to drag the corpses for  him.  His initial response was to
call me retarded.  Then he had the balls to show up with  his corpses
hehe.  If he hadn't looted the second corpse after I resed the first
managing to screw himself out of one res it might have almost been
upsetting.  As it was his guildies had new understanding why I won't
join their guild and we all had a good laugh at his expense.
