Yes, you will go faster as you level... your sneak/hide modification will
decrease allowing I think almost normal travel while sneaking/hiding. -
Check out http://server3.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.html for more info on the
Rogue.
Oh, and I think you can move and stay hidden for as long as you like while
sneaking as long as you aren't agroed by a MOB that can see you (undeads,
etc.,) but I believe the sneak/hide of the rogue - especially that of the
halfling rogue allows you to hide from even some MOB that would normally see
through camo/invis.
