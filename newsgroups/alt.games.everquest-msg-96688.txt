Hi:

Before now I've always tried to equip my Wizard with as much Int as I could,
and until yesterday was happily going along my way with my total of 221 Int
for my 51st level character. In a conversation with a friend we struck upon
the subject of mana calculation, something I've not bothered looking into.
My friend pointed out to me (rightly so) that sometimes I can equip my
Wizard with better things at the slight loss of Int, so below is my
scenario.

Which is *better* for me *mana*-wise .. and please, can you give me the most
up to date mana calculation formula so I might be able to work this out
myself? Yes I've checked on various EQ Sites for mana calculators and but
there seems to be a difference in opinion as to how mana is calculated post
SoL. Anyway .. my scenario ..

Yesterday afternoon: Level 51 Wizard wearing 221 Int *plus* additional 155
in mana points on my gear.
Late last night: Level 51 Wizard wearing 200 Int *plus* additional 325 mana
points on my gear. (I didn't want to fall below 200 Int)

Although my Int has been lowered by some 21 points my hit points and saves
have been greatly boosted, but I just need to be sure that lowering my Int
won't have a diverse affect on my character. I've been told that the new cap
for Int was raised from 200 to 255 .. Can someone give me some pointers
please?

Thank you very much for your time .. safe hunting to you all ...

Stevie.
