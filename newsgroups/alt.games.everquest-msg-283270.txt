I played EQ from a few months after its release till shortly after 
Velious, then quit, big time, sold my account, went cold turkey.

I was back within 5 months, played till around SOY, quit and substituted 
  Anarchy Online (which was FREE to play!) but again was back within 5 
months or so... this time, though, I quit again just a few months later, 
more a case of tapering off gradually and then deciding it didn't make 
sense to pay for the account if I wasn't actually using it.

Well its been 5 or 7 months and here I am again, thinking about EQ and 
all the good times.

I remember the Qeynos Aqueducts, Blackburrow, Crushbone, the Aviak 
village... I remember EW, GD, Kael Drakkar, CC, WW... I remember Shar 
Val, Hollowshade, Shadeweaver...

I remember those zones and dozens more, not as zones in a game I once 
played, but better than I remember my high school, my home town, my 
grandmother's farm; I could navigate around them now, blindfolded 
(unless they've been updated like Lavastorm was... I remember old 
lavastorm, but new lavastorm I remember from the map)

I had a GREAT time playing EQ, I met a lot of great people, and had a 
good time getting around some not so great people.  I felt a real sense 
of accomplishment advancing my characters, getting better gear, leveling 
up, and learning the various skills of different classes and how to work 
and play together with different partners and groups.

Sadly, I also remember spending too much time, not enjoying myself, but 
just slogging away out of habit or because I hoped to run across 
something enjoyable to do later.

So, here I sit, thinking about coming back... and then shuddering.  Do I 
-want- to come back?  Does the world I remember so fondly even exist 
anymore?

I could come back as a new character, or I could restart with any of a 
couple dozen characters running from mid 20s to mid 50s, even a couple 
65s... I played after they raised the cap to 70, but I didn't play my 65 
characters at that time, I leveled "fresh start" characters up instead.

Here's the thing though, I never was much into the raid scene; to me, 
the larger the group, the less enjoyable for the most part, and the 
exceptions to that were things like killing Vox or doing Epic mobs or 
running thru Kael and crushing everything in there... NOT the repetitive 
"do this same encounter again and again and again" type of raiding 
necessary to "gear up" to the point where you can move on to the next 
challenge.

Not only did that mechanism bore the tears out of me, but I always found 
the reward system really sucked; generally politics or long term 
commitment from people who'd been in a given guild far longer than I had 
meant that I'd always get the short end of the gear stick... not that 
this doesn't make sense for the good of the guild, but as a player of a 
game, it didn't make ME happy.

I guess what I'm asking here is, whats EQ like these days.

And I suspect what I'm doing is talking myself out of logging back in :)
