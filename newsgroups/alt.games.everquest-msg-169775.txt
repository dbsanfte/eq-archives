Either what I wrote doesn't mean anything even vaguely similar to
what I meant it to say or your reply is incredibly ironic.  Tell me,
how is it elitist for me to be offended by behavior I find offensive?
Having gotten that far, tell me how the way you've rather obviously
taken offense at my comment is in any way different?  How do you
justify your obnoxious elitism?

Go for it.

It would appear, Matt, that there is a pretty severe breakdown in
communication here.  Your replies make it obvious that you do not
understand what I was trying to say.  I'll assume that is mostly
my fault and attempt to correct it below.

I'm not quite sure where "people who enjoy spending 2 hours trading
incomprehensible dialect strewn gibberish" comes into this.  You're
implying a cooperative situation to which everybody has given at
least the consent implied by voluntarily joining in.  As for XP,
I've played far too much EQ in the past 3-1/2 years.  In that time
I've gotten <one> character over level 40, my L55 Paladin, who has
accounted for somewhat over half of my total playing time.  I'm
afraid that if you want to "grind out the most efficient XP possible"
you won't be doing it with me.

I don't invite random people into groups.  Somebody incomprehensible
won't be in a group I'm leading.


Let me try to explain my position in short simple sentences.

That is not any sort of dig at you.  Just a recognition that
what I thought I wrote and what you read are two very different
things.

When I group in EQ my primary objective is to have fun in the
company of other players.  A crucial element of my fun is that
my groupmates also be having fun.  An equally important element
of my fun is that my groupmates have a similarly cooperative
approach to play.  If somebody in the group places a premium on
their fun over everybody else's fun it ends up wrecking things
for everybody.  When I'm in a group that's attempting something
challenging in-game, I expect everybody to put forth their best
effort to surmount the challenge.  Especially in a group that is
not used to working together, communication is crucial to success
in this sort of endeavor.  If you are deliberately making yourself
difficult to understand in such a situation, without at least the
implied consent of your fellow adventurers, you're having <your>
fun at the expense of the others (damn, long sentence, hope it's
clear anyway).  This last, having your fun at others' expense, is
selfish and discourteous.  I fail to see how being offended at
somebody else's self-serving rudeness makes me an elitist.  OTOH,
I would probably be inferring an elitist "RP uber alles" attitude
from your comments if they weren't so incredibly defensive in
context.
