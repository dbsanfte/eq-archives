Yep, it is the point. Its for some people and not for others. It isn't
for me really in a game as PVE as everquest is. There is just too much
of a time investment to have it made worse by people out to get you.

I've always heard that about Rallos then I've always wondered "then
what the hell is the point?"

Yeah the only add on rule verant made is that you can't train people
with npcs to kill them when they have no way of getting back at you
really. They made that rule because one famous (or infamous rather)
bard got to level 5 then trained SGs perpetually on evil types in
Oasis saying he was doing it because he can. Eventually a GM talked to
him then suddenly made up that new rule. He was basically causing
those other characters LARGE loss while he'd suffer no loss at all in
a death and since all he did was run with his bard song and drum to
get more giants to train on people, he'd be hard to catch even. He had
no other purpose ;)

>those.

I did, they were similar since races were on diff teams even though
you got no points and could not legally cause xp loss with npcs. High
elves and wood elves had it the worst being right in the middle of the
gnomes and dwarves on another team. I made a halfling and went and
joined the dwarves and gnomes and I'd run naked up to the wood elf
city to train then run back, was kinda funny ;)

Ah yeah probabaly one of those conquest type guilds if not conquest
themselves.

Yep, its hard to roleplay ganking someone and moreover pointless to do
so. Its the same thing if you do it quietly or do it yelling how dark
elves are evil.

Ummm.. but a lot of people do exactly that.. ;) I think they go to
raves.
