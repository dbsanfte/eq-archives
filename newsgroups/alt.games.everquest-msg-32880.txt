I only seem to resist it when I cast it on myself.  The handful of times it
has worked on me, I only take half damage from the blast.  (Oh, BTW DON"T
cast this near the guards in Freeport... I got two resist messages, and then
realised that I was being beaten to death by the two gate guards... ooops, I
feel stupid).

But the other night when I fired it at a giant to show off to my druid pet,
the giant closed with me, and I was caught in the blast... took full damage,
and was thrown high into the sky, looking at the frost giant scout wiggling
around with me... it was funny to watch... but gave me a very rude "WAKE UP
this can still be dangerous!" reminder.
