Each "point" of AAexp requires the same raw amount of experience as
level 51-52.

If you wait until 55+ to put exp into AAexp, you can fight higher
level mobs than at level 51. This means that you will gain AAexp
points faster. The level 60s in my guild can ding an AA point a night
pretty easily if they set thier mind to it. For raw power and
effectiveness Levels>AAxp. On the other hand solo classes like BLs can
really benefit from the first tier of AA skills (runspeed, regen)

It really depends on how you want to play. Another monk in my guild
put 100% into AA at level 51. He put 3 points into Runspeed, and 3
points into Regen. He pulls MUCH better than I do in raids, because he
does a better job of outrunning the mobs we pull, and heals faster
while feigning. 

If I were you, I would seriously consider getting 3 points into
natural regen. Iksar/Trolls get an additional bonus with AA points and
regen. (+2hps per tick per AA point).
