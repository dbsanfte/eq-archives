"Dalton White" <zesaraiz@cox-internet.com> :

>hey just got a question here. Anyone know if ya mess up your beastlord epic like i did the fight in td only 5 of the druz images spawned for me so verant after 24 hours reimbursed me for the 6th shard i need but then when i went back to td the scout was gone..... when the next scout spawns can i hand him the bag of broken glass will he let me continue my epic by giving me back the piece i need to have for the next step or am i gonna have to start completely over at the scouts again?
>thanks
>Zes

Yes you can turn into the scout, But you need to do the initial turn
in process to spawn the 6 skellys.  Then he is set to accept the
turnin.

Sorta lame because it messes it up for the next beast needing to do
skellys... but this happend to me and numerous others..

good luck
