Yow, thats overclocking your AGP bus, not your video card - although I'm
sure you'll still benefit from it some. Overclocking your video card depends
on what card you have. If you have an Nvidia card, do a Google search for
the 'coolbits' registry patch. Once you install that you can change your
video card's clock settings right in your display settings. For others, I
dont know. It seems there is a utility called PowerStrip that handles that
sort of thing, but I'm not sure.
