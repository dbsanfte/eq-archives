Hey all.  I am not an expert EQ player, don't know much about equipment or
weapons.. I just play every now and then to pass the time, and have managed
to get my dwarven warrior to 23rd level...  But lately, I've been wanting to
build up my character a little more, stock him up a little...because I know
I don't have the weapons and armor I probably should have at this point.

Can you guys give me pointers on what I should probably be carrying and
equiping up to this point?  I have a 23rd level warrior dwarf.  And please,
no Avenger Battle Axe mentions... that quest is making my dwarf pull his
beard out....  That darn Faldor Hendrys.

Thanks
