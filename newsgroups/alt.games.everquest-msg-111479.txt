It would be nice to be able to make a paper note. An object with your
name on it, that has lets say, less than 80 characters on it.

You can pass a note to someone, or make an IOU. Or even keep notes for
yourself.

"Find me and hand me this and I will help you."

"IOU 100PP"

"Raid gathers at Faydark spires 8:00PM EDT"

"Meet Foxee the wood elf druid at east freeport at 11pm PDT"

Of course that would ne entirely non-enforceable by a GM. An IOU would
not be the same as a check. I just think it would be a nice easy thing
to do which would fill a niche.
