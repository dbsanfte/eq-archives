I'm betting the spell book and hell level changes simply fall more into
the category of "design stuff we don't bother mentioning in the patch
message". They don't always specifically call out every change they do
in patches (particularly the nerfs) and like to leave some things "for
the players to discover". The spell book thing will be immediately
obvious. Given the possible implicaitons of the hell level changes, I
think they'll want to say as little as freaking possible about that and
wait for everyone to just forget about it and move on.
