The reason everyone keep going back to your monetary loss, is the fact
that that is the only area in which we can reasonably understand how
you've lost anything.

I'll repeat what others have said, because I am of the same opinion.
If all you had to offer your pals was taxi service, you were already
obsolete. That would have been pretty pathetic, and you should try
another class, because either the druid class is obviously not for
you, or your friends don't know enough to appreciate it. Have a little
self-respect and demand more than the privilege of being their port
whore.

You took such offense to an earlier posting (DD, I believe?)
suggesting that maybe your plight results more from shortcomings of
your own, since nothing was taken from you from a
performance/effectiveness standpoint, which is what group desirability
is all about. Sounds like a reasonable possibility to me.
