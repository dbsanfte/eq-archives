So that gives you the right to tee off on a total stranger who is
trying to find a little enjoyment in a passtime that you obviously
take entirely too seriously?

Just because you have had a bad day doesn;t mean you have the right to
pass on your misfortune to others. You might, instead, take a quick
second to consider how your actions impact on the world around you.
You feel pretty crappy right now don;t you? What was it, some jerk sut
you off in traffic? Boss climbed your frame? Your account got hacked??
Whatever it was it made you angry and ill enough to lash out at a
total stranger that was feeling pretty good until you came along.....
much the same as what probably happened to you to put you in a crappy
mood. Doesn;t it make you feel really good now to know that you made
somebody else feel the way somebody made you feel?

Thank you very much for your self centered view of life.
