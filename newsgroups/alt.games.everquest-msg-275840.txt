You're right.There is a posting from a developer on the Sony boards,
sorry its very late and I am too lazy to search for link.Though he
didnt mention "spend endless hours training them up by making useless 
items".   :)
Seriously,as usual they didnt think it to the end,while I can raise
every other tradeskill to 150 or even nearly 200 with vendor bought
components or very easy to farm stuff,there are no components
easily available to raise research afaik.It was mentioned in the
posting,that trainers will only train it up to 21 like every other
trade skill.
Yeah Sony,thats the way to go,make the game harder for
newbies,a sure way to attract new customers.  :p
