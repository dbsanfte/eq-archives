You know, the plus side is, we're kind of neutral as far as reputations 
go ;)  We don't have a horrid name (at least I don't think so - Cel?  
Graeme? :)) but neither do we have a sterling one (/rude open invite 
policy) - and if he ever did go so far as to take it back, I doubt much 
of us would care - there were already a few suggestions of either 
restarting a new guild with stricter policies or splitting the guild and 
making one open and no level requirements, and one a "progressed" 
version with a level requirement and with more rules, goals, and so on.

And the key phrase is IF he goes that far.  I really don't know him.  
He's a bit disturbing in his zealousness but hey, he could mean well for 
the guild.
