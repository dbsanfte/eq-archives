Orcs in Oasis are on Orc faction.  They don't share faction
with any other group.  The orcs that share faction with the
dark elves, are the Crushbone orcs, on the continent of
Faydewar, primarily in G'fay and Crushbone, but also found
in Butcherblock, and Lesser Faydark.
I doubt seriously you are KOS as a necro in the Overthere,
as gnomes, and erudites who are evil classes are not KOS. 
Hope that helped.
