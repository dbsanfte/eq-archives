Okay, It's been a while since I logged my 31 Bard...  I've been playing my
Druid almost exclusively...  Anyway, a group of us in my guild were planning
to take the Ass / Sup room in LGuk, so I thought I'd park my bard nearby, in
case the mask dropped...

Anyway, was travelling along, and switched my view with the F9 key, just to
have a look around while running...  and I gasped!  held tightly in my
bard's hand was an actual -drum-....  It even -looked- like a drum!  No more
patting on a flute as I streak from zone to zone!  Heh..  Anyone know when
this change happened?
