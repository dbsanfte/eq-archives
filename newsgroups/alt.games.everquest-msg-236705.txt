Yeah it does wander. 
I kind of forgot about the int casters.

A pretty darn high level Int caster wanders around the second qeynos
zone. The only way to really fix being kos to it, is to gather the
stuff for unser's call (its on allakhazam's, in the qeynos quest
sections.) I forget exactly what you need but its stuff you can
usually find on npc vendors around qeynos, when your vendor faction is
high enough.

That is where the one use halfling form mask comes into play, or using
a form potion (or even getting a wolf form) You go to the guy for
unser's call and give him the quest stuff in the other form. The one
problem is, I'm not sure if you are non KOS in the other form to the
Jagged Pine resident guy, stuck right around the caster's guild now
for a quest in the Jagged Pine zone. At the time I raised int caster's
there to indifferent on my dark elf cleric, that guy was not there
yet. He was a surprise when I was totally non kos to qeynos and was
casually shopping at the int caster area.

So he kind of rained on my parade, but he only attacks if you are
right at the int caster's guild area. I had no trouble at the bank,
which is nearby.

yeah and do some research to find out about "surprise" npcs like that
guy.
