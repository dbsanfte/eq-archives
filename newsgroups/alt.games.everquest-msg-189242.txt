Bot9 = group (rune); Pot9 = single (spectral).  Get it right!  That includes
calling it by the right name! Pot*9*! Pot*9*! Pot*9*!

The blackened vial is a pain.  I've gotten 2 gunthak waters (foraging), 4
broken skull bloods, one Pure blood, and still no vial, and that's with some
severe charmed boar troll molestation.  Have gotten about 20k worth of
sellable stuff though from whacking nameds in Nadox (steel wrapped bp, steel
wrapped leggings x2, coral adorned mask, hate forged pauldrons,
twice-stiched (sic) sandals, ceremonial hate candle, a few 50+ research
words, still no charms though, of course my mage friend got the wis/agi
charm on his first kill in gunthak >_< )
