Way to get around this will cost you $39.00. Open an account on Stormhammer
Create characters with the same name on Stormhammer. Transfer characters to
stormhammer there will be an x at the end of the characters name. Petition
to change change the names to know characters on your old server. After a
couple days cancel Legends and requst a move back to old server. There will
be an x at the end of the name petition to change names.
