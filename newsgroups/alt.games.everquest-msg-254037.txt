Note that each skill is level capped. e.g. your 1HS is capped at 
5+(level x 5). (formula for a melee class)

So at 5th level the maximum it can be is 30. If you ding to 6th, and 
immediately spend your 5 points on 1hs to get it to 35 you will never 
see it skill up on its own because you are already at the cap.

Occasionally, if you get rooted, and can't reach the mob to melee you 
might shoot at it instead of just standing there watching your group 
take a pounding :). Or in some cases to plunk a couple shots into an 
incoming mob, or as a ranged pulling tool (although you also have 
spells... so its not a big deal for that either).

Paladin's do pretty insignificant damage with bows. By all means get a 
bow if you wish... but it will never be a terribly relevant part of the 
game for you, in my opinion. Bows are pretty much fun little side 
diversion, at best, for any class but Ranger.
