I am the original poster of this thread.... I had posted it in discust
and not looked back since... A few weeks later I come back to see it
has generated over 800 replies. WoW. My intent was not to create a
flame war, just to post a story about Blizzard customer service.
Normally I would not pour gas on a fire, but I am posting a follow-up
because I see that 90% of you HAVE MISSED THE POINT COMPLETELY...
which is disappointing... Its clear many of you did not read past the
first page (lazy!). This thread was NOT about the definition of the
word pussy! It could have been any word ie: Bush, Beaver, Bush, FaQ,
"Meet the Fokkers", Shiat, Anal....etc etc (all will get you banned,
trust me I checked).

This thread was asking you how much censorship you like in your games
(note they already have a profanity filter, but still ban people who
swear or use other words they dont like, ie FAQ).

This thread was asking you how you'd feel if you were banned without
warning for using the word "bush" when referring to a plant, or the
expression "eager beaver". Etc Etc.

This thread was about Blizzard's policy of handing out 72 hour
suspensions to anyone they possibly can, without warning (which is
suspicious considering the enormous lag/server issues their having).
This thread is a statement about their customer service.

Lastly, and most importantly, this thread is about Blizzard violating
their own rules which they replied to me with (as posted on their
website - see quote in original post).

I am well aware that it is David and Goliath situation and nothing
will change from this thread. I've heard that they've oversold the
game so badly that they've haulted production until their servers can
stabilize. So I know they wont miss my $15/month. But the only thing
worse then unjustice is people that bend over and accept unjustice
while do nothing about it. At the least your now aware of how
mindlessly anal this corporation is. Awareness is good.

PS - I've been playing LOTR Battle For Middle Earth since I quit WoW.
It's a different kind of game but I'm really enjoying it. Its one of
the best real-time-strategy games I've played since Starcraft.
Especially with a good computer and THX surround sound its very fun,
check out the reviews it's getting. I thank Blizzard customer service
for turning me on to it =)
