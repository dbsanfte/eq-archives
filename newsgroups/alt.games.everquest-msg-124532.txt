Yes, it could be that... But  I've also gotten that message with DX8.1 
installed and an appropriate card.  The issue turned out to be that DX8.1 
has a bug (a bug? in a Micro$oft product? what're the odds! :) ) that 
causes it under certain unidentified circumstances to claim that 
DirectDraw3D is turned on when it isn't really.  So you have to run 
dxdiag.exe, turn it off until it says it's really really off now, then 
turn it back on.  Then everything is cool. :)
