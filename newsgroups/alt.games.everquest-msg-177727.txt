He told me that I am going to physically die of heart failure(my heart will
just stop beating) within this period, not necessarily in 3.5 years, any
time between now and then when he is ready to take me.(and he seems ready to
take me, and I am ready to go) He told me that as far as I am concerned I'm
going to heaven when I die and nothing can change that, I will also be
getting a prophets reward, whatever that is, seems like one of the better
ones you can get though.

So anyway, I guess I'll die at some point, probably an article will be
printed in the paper portraying me as a horrible person, and probably my
mother will just leave my body to rot in my bed for three days.

Then I will come back to life, and God will call me and the other prophet up
into heaven, then a few minutes later.....

An earthquake will hit the Silicon Valley or Las Vegas or both at the same
time and kill 7000 people which is about 250% more people than were killed
on 9/11. Sounds like all the people in these two areas will decide that God
is serious at this point and admit there is some truth to be found somewhere
there but they won't know what it is and continue down the path they were
on.

Here are the verses

Rev 11: 7-13

[7] And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall
overcome them, and kill them.

[8] And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which
spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.

[9] And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see
their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead
bodies to be put in graves.

[10] And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make
merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets
tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

[11] And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered
into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them
which saw them.

[12] And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up
hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld
them.

[13] And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of
the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and
the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
