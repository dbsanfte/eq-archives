You get the same things as on the free sites.

On some which offer both, like allakhazams, you simply get more
ease of use. If you pay on allakhazams you can have a view of
equipment dropped by zone. If you don't pay you only have the option
of doing equipment by body part/class etc.

eqatlas is free and allakhazams is free (except for what I mentioned
above) and are all I ever need. Sometimes I also check out eqlizer or
eqtraders, both also free. I never thought eqmaps was very good and
maybe visited it like twice BEFORE it cost money.
