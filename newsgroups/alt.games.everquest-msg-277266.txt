I can point to other *individuals* that have "done it all" in EQ2/WoW.  In
other words, there is a shortage of content for some people/play-styles,
even if you *personally* have not run out yet.  Whether that shortage of
content affects a large portion of the playerbase, or a small ratio, is what
I consider a "practical" example of "plenty of content".

There are people in EQ who have "done it all".  As near as I can tell, that
applies to maybe a couple dozen people max, and that's probably an
overestimation because the people that have done the latest-and-greatest
I often find out never saw a lot of older raid content.
