When aggro kiting the idea is to never let the pet get aggro.  For example,
I snare a guard in HoH; cast a dot or two and then send in my pet.  The pet
runs along backstabbing the guard while I run to one corner wait for the
guard to get close to me and then run to the next corner.  I want to
maintain aggro all the time, otherwise the guard will beat my pet up in a
few rounds of hits.
