Like many others, I think these changes are great.  Having a high level
cleric, I'm not forced to stare at that annoying book any longer, however,
I don't think that others should be forced to spend 35 levels of that
garbage.   Now I just turn and face a wall while sitting, much nicer :)

As for the other changes which affect new/young players again - excellent
idea.  There is a ton to this game, and I think that people given a little
help while starting out will make it more enjoyable for them in the long
run.  You do sound bitter since nothing really benefits you, why should you
care what they do for new players?
