I'm considering "moving on" from DAoC, and was wondering whether I'd
enjoy EQ.

I have a few questions, if anyone can help out...

1. Are there UK servers? Which would be a good server to join if I am
a complete n00b and enjoy roleplaying, despise PvP (OK stop laughing,
I know, didn't I choose the right game in DAOC), and don't want to
play thousands of hours a week?

2. How bad is the level treadmill? How long will it take to get to a
"sensible" level at which I can enjoy much of what the game has to
offer, and how long does it take to reach your cap?

3. Is it easy to find good groups? (This has been a real pain in
DAoC.)

Any other hints/tips/check out www.something.com would be greatly
appreciated. There's an EQ bundle for ï¿½25 from amazon - I was hoping
that was enough to get me started, but I vaguely recalling reading
that PoP also helps newbies due to quick travel and some new lowbie
spells...

Anyway, many thanks!

Shrub.
