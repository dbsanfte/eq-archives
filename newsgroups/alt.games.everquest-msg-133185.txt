Damnit....now you got me curious. Hope this new excitement doesnt lead
to massive xp loss but last night was my first AOE group......sort of.
consisted of.

Cleric
Cleric
Druid
Wizard
Wizard
Big ol Ogre warrior with lots of AC and HP

Now I was one of the wizards. We were both 19th level.
The rest were like 14 -16 and we were at orc shrine in
oasis. No chanters stunning but ogre could taunt to no
end and took hardly any damage. Ogre would pull a bunch
and get them all around him in a tight knot. Then druid
and wizards would spam AOE's while clerics healed tank
and took aggro off casters. Not the same sort of AOE
group youve been discussing but it was massive xp for
the lower levels and pretty good for us 19's. Also, we
werent using PBAOEs (dont have the runes yet). I wanna
do this again with ogre pulling about 12 or so and each
of us spamming PBAOEs. I guess the ogre was acting as
a enchanter here with the premise that instead of being
stunned they keep attention on him. The dynamics of this
will change of course as we get up in level and we cant
let mobs beat on us for even a second before they either
get stunned or tank regains aggro. At least it was a fun
break from the idiot monotony of low level grinding.
