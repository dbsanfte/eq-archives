One further wrinkle in this corpse change is that CoH does not work in
some planes.  I know for a fact it does not work in Plane of
Innovation, so corpses that sit too long on a raid are going to end up
back at the graveyard and mages are not going to be able help in
bringing the newly rezzed back to the raid.  I did not get a chance to
test if corpse summoning worked or not.
