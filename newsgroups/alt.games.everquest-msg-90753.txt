Not a bad concept.  I probably wouldn't take much advanage of it, but it's
not a bad concept for those who would.  To this point I've never paid for a
rez.  I have nothing against it, and may one day if the hit is hard enough.
I died working Giants in FV the other day (stupid drolvargs <g>) and lost
dang near 4 blues, but to me that's part of it ... the risk of the loss.  I
do a lot of soloing, and the way I look at it, if I overpull and die it's my
own fault.  In the time that it takes me to beg for a rez and get it, I
could've soloed a big chunk of the XP back.

I haven't really noticed this to be true (on CT, anyway).  I still get about
20p per seat on a port, with the occasional rush job paying as much as 100p.
Bind was never a big money maker in my case ... I usually gave them away.
In fact, I still do if some requests a bind somewhere other than the loc of
the Soulbinder (the entrance to CB is one example).

Just my opinion (and as my wife says, everyone's entitled to my opinion ...
heh).
