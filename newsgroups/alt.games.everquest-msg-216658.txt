I got my friend into the game a few weeks ago, so we duo whenever he plays.
We've gotten his druid to 24, and my necro to 25.  Questions:
    Good place to hunt for the duo?  I thought the cougars in iceclad would
be great, only to find out they are mostly red with a few yellows.  South
karana better?  What about Marus Seru?
    Also, neither of us have a lot of money, so I was wondering if anyone
could make a couple gear suggestions, say at about a 250-400pp each range.
Those are the questions, but any other suggestions would be welcomed.
