I love reading the Short Bus Gang posts. They all think they have something
to prove here. We don't care how well you can "flame". We don't care how
"witty" you think you can get. All you kids do is provide mindless
entertainment
for me while I'm at work.

You all get so worked up over stupid posts. I love it. Thank you.
