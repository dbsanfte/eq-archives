Assumeing both Characters are on the same account JBoots will be tough in
Sro the Cleric should be able to take the AC provided he or she can get a
root to stick and hold. You will need a SOW of some sort. Another problem
being your Cleric is not strong enough to win the AC if someone tries to KS
it. Final obstacale once killed your wizard may not make it to the AC corpse
before someone loots it. I can't say what I would do if I happened by an AC
corpse with a ring on it and nobody around. I would like to think I would be
honorable but then again I am a Troll Warrior and weak in front of
temptation.

Staff of the Wheel will require some ITU and SOW poitions and being able to
gate everywhere needed.
