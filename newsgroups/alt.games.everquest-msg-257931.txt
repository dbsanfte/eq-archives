Hmm, I though the same (after buying it thinking 51 was sufficient) and 
lamented that fact, and someone said that's no longer the case, that 55 
is now sufficient.

Will be a long wait if I have to be flagged for one of the above, I'm in 
a "family" guild at the moment, which has shown no interest in POP flagging.

This is sort of a catch 22; by the time I'm finally able to get the 
thing, I won't be able to kill anything unslowed, and if I have a slower 
I also have a haster, which means the 30% haste is inconsequential.

Course it still beats the 5% damage bonus that applies only to throwing

Grage
