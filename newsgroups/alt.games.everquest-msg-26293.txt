I don't know how they do it, but the 'hardware' twinking seems to go a lot
faster then a normal human could do it. I'm thinking of a clown I saw in
Misty Thicket who solo'd a twink character from 1-5 and shouted "DING! 5
levels in 53 minutes!" Actually since you start at 1 it was only 4 level so
figure the guy is not exactly Brainiac.

He must of dropped a couple of backpacks full of junk vs loging in and out
with just a few pieces at risk. I inspected him and he was loaded. Anyway,
that would have left him 19 hours and 7 minutes of playing to go from 5 to
twenty. Kind of wish I would have been there when his main was dropping that
crap on the ground.<grin> But yes, you should add in the time he spent with
his main sorting out crap and bagging it to drop. He was online more then 53
minutes to do it, just with his other character setting everything up.

Twinks still have some pathing bugs too. I have seen necros in Qeynos
Aquaducts pulling NPCs to these spots and just sitting there medding while
the NPC dies from a poison bolt after poison bolt.
