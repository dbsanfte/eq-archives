As someone posted on another thread- an easy way to keep sense
direction maxed is to do the following:

Put Sense Direction in one of your HotKey slots - I use 10
Go to your Keyboard setting under options
Under Hotkey  10- map the left arrow key and then the right arrow key
as your alternate.

Now whenever you hit the left or right arrow- it will activate sense
direction.

Of course- this is only useful to people who use the mouse/arrowkey
combo to move around.

Hope this made sense.
