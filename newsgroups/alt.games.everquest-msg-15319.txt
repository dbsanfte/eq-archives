Nope. I thought the same thing at times. I played my monk on that island for
two and a half levels (with shaman partner). We had many nights where we were
lucky to get a pair of eyes out of ten gargs. Then other times suddenly there
would be a drop on 3 out of 5. I'd just say you were on an *unbelieveably* luck
streak before, and now the odds are swinging back to normal.

I don't know what vendors you use, but you're getting rippe off. We were
getting damn near ten plat off vendors (9 PP, 6GP comes to mind, but don't
quote that) so 12 isn't much of a markup. Probably just high enough level that
the extra two was worth the time saved in hunting them himself or scrounging
through vendors.

Don't know of any new quests, but the Necro's use them for a component for
something and have for a while. I had necros looking to buy ours as early as
late winter.
