I think one of the main problems is, as its been mentioned, population
makeup.  There are of course far more evils than newts or goods.  I'm one of
them with an Ogre warrior.  I think perhaps if they implement a quota system
in which you cannot create a char from one team until the overall population
is more equal.  Of course this may drive people away even more.  Maybe they
could allow some characters access to a different diety.
