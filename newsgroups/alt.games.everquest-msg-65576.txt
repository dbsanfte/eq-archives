Well there you go - if you had to pop the case to see whether your 
motherboard has an AGP slot I guess you didn't spec the motherboard. If 
you've bought a pre-made PC they will usually use cruddy mobos with onboard 
stuff in order to cut costs.

All the major mobo manufacturers make boards with no onboard video and 
audio but you have to check that and buy one of those specifically.

People who don't know any better tend to get the motherboards with all that 
rubbish onboard because such boards are usually a bit cheaper, I guess 
because they have bigger production runs (since they're used by system 
builders). System builders use them for that reason and to save even more 
money by not having to include a soundcard/videocard/network 
card/modem/whatever.

Now, to reduce the cost of the motherboard, they won't include stuff they 
don't think you'll need. The manufacturer's thinking goes something like 
this - why would you need an AGP slot when you have a spiffy AGP graphics 
chipset built right into the board, complete with, oh, 4Mb of texture 
memory (4Mb should be enough for anyone)? Its not like you're ever going to 
upgrade your video is it? If you're the sort of person who buys a pre-built 
PC you probably won't be happy upgrading bits and pieces yourself so you'll 
probably just throw the whole thing away and get a new one when your PC is 
becoming outdated. Let's save money in production costs by leaving the AGP 
slot out.

Ditto PCI slots - you only ever get 2 or 3 on these boards, since they 
figure you would only want them for soundcards, videocards, network cards, 
etc, and all that is built into the motherboard anyway.

Motherboards with *anything* onboard are a nightmare to upgrade.
