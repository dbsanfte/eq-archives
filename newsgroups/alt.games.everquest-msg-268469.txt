And you call us top heavy :)

We have 2 Anguish guilds.  Guild 3 was aborsbed (was 2 trials from Anguish).
Guilds 4 and 5 are doing some kindof alliance to still have numbers to do
PoTime (and failing it seems, Jeril can answer better).  Below that I don't
even know.

We use 40% attendence too, for loot elegibility.  We don't kick below 20 or
any other though.

Thats rubbish.  The pre-time guilds on my server have won some trials.  I've
done some with bot crew too, bots galore, beastlord tank etc.

Rift BP's are about 140p.  If your not in a time BP (specifically plate
classes) its a nice upgrade.  And I don't forsee you wracking up on Time
BP's with a few farm ventures..

The random drop mask is better stats than phase 1 and 2.
The earing is better than most of times earings. Yes, TT, Innie and Quarm
can drop better. But you know as well as I do how rare they can be. 2 of
these dropped for us, 1 went to the guilds second best geared cleric, the
other went to our best geared Bard

That is far from being crap.

If you are recruiting melees using weapon haste.....

Only 70's on him that I've seen.  And if hes contested so what?  Plan your
schedule around the gimp mob spawns who take 5 mins to kill and can drop
items like +400 mana pool.

I didnt mention mana regen because the trial one beats everything (even
quarms, for cast time).

Well a lot of raid slowing (the first slow) isn't turgers anymore, but
nih'li.  Slow stick is a nice utility but it doesn't make or break anything.
1.5 is way better stats.

40 mins in qvic (1 hour if cyno and zoo is up)
1 hour: Anueks+Chamption evemt
2 hours: Zun, 2 goats, Ancient Crag.
2 hours: Inktu'ta

So kill him when he is up. He's not going to wait for you to find him up. 3
groups is enough - do him out of prime time if necessary!

Thats what happens when I don't loot

I think he's died 3 times since Omens on VS.

Bot them.  If Zun is rotated (along with qvic) why are you never getting
Cyno and Zoo?
Fix the rotation or FCFS it. Simple

So do we.  We stock piled a lot of quest items from back in the day though.
Also a bunch doesn't need uqua drops to make either.

6 more from qvic

How can all this gear still be prime choice for mains, if you have an
attendence % to boot the slackers
How can people blow their dkp/loot merit on txevu crap when Rift, MPG,
Anguish is just as farmable and way better?

Then perhaps its time to change that fact.  Dont let them be the ones to
break it and profit from your struggle and kill you off.

So get in on the action. Why can't you do the same?

Prexus and VS both has them.

We didn't do Runt often.  We only did Ixts before ACM too, and only did the
1 nearest.  2 times total, have we bothered to clear both goats.

Time is faster at supplying weaker more outdated gear quicker.

I went link dead about 25 times whilst my ISP didnt lose connection even
once.
I met Adolf. Adolph, Adolff, Beyonce, Beckham, Cantona, and about 30 other
unimaginitive bastard names in the space of a few hours.

I killed stuff so easy it was silly.  Auto attack bow, plunk an arrow from
max range and the mob would be dead before it even reaches me, maybe 1 melee
hit needed tops.
There was a goblin camp, had about 12 mobs in it.  Plunked an arrow at the
centre mob, and he comes solo WTF?  Killed the entire camp without downtime
and took maybe 3 melee blows in the process.  Wru adds, wru challenge?

The chat interface was limited and clumsy, not a patch on EQ.  Graphics I
don't care for, it wouldn't be my choice for playing or quitting (look how
retarded DE's moved in L2, i still played one). The models though, pig ugly.
EQ has some ok and some horrible models, WoW had 1 model that didn't look
retarded.  Everything in L2 was beautiful.

No I can't say how good or bad its content is, but I can say I easily had
endlessly more fun in a week of L2 than WoW.  The problem with L2 is PK
games always attract the fucking morons of online games, and their
actions/moronic chatter spoils it for everybody. (WoW chatter was pretty
hardcore, racist bs etc, but Im sure on live servers it will be clamped down
on.

What does my opinion matter anyway :)
