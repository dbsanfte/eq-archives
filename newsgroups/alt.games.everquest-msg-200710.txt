And...?  Where did I say I was actually using it at 28?  I stuck around 
in that zone for quite a few levels post-34.

Yeah, typo'd that in my calculator.  So 5 less mana per tick = 25 less 
per minute (keeping my assumption of medding for half the ticks) = 125 
less over the course of a kill and it's getting closer.  I think the 
difference if I took into account the proper root spell would still keep 
it sufficient though.

I only used LS as a basis for the estimation of total HP on the Large 
Zelniaks.  Nowhere else did it figure into my calculations.  If you check 
over 'em, I based it on Snare, Creeping Crud, Stinging Swarm and Grasping 
Roots with a pair of focus effects.
