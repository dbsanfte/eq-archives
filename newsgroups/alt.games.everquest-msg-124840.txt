    The monks that do the pull are, and it is apparently an important part
of how they do it.

    I'll use an example that isn't what I'm trying to avoid saying: take
Rumblecrush. Once you get Rumblecrush solo and incoming to camp, you have
some issues when he gets there. He has a very high damage output until he's
debuffed, so you have to get him debuffed ASAP or clerics will die casting
CH early (and since Rumble isn't damaged enough yet, he runs to the clerics
rather than summoning them and that puts him right in the middle of the
casters). But debuffing ASAP has the same effect as the early CH - Rumble
runs straight to the debuffers, who are likely near other casters, and tears
up half the raid. So, as an alternative to that, have the debuffers be the
ones to tag Rumble on the pull, and have them tag with their debuffs. They
might die, they might not depending on if the main tank can get close and
AoE Taunt in time - but the rest of the raid doesn't eat it, too. The only
other consideration is you have to keep the debuffers out of Rampage range
for the entire fight, or they could get low HP aggro early and still drag
Rumblecrush onto themselves.

    If Rumblecrush were perma-rooted, then by what you folks call "gimp
tactics" you wouldn't do this. Even though you'd want to do this if he
weren't perma-rooted. If Vyemm were pullable, we'd want him slowed just as
he was coming into camp, before tanks engaged. That minimizes the damage he
can do when we try to get him controlled. Because he's rooted, we cannot
debuff him on the pull - so we debuff him while he's standing there, and we
have the main tank pump him full of arrows at the same time to build hate.

    When? I was on the lookout for it, and didn't see it. What's your
EZBoard name?
