The n45 is over two years old.  I can't imagine why you would spend the
money to buy a 486 when P4's are on the market.
When you decide to buy the n52 buy.com has one for only $25 and
they are in stock.

I know this didn't answer your original e-mail, but all the research I
did on the Belkin line suggested that the n45 was okay, but not great.
The n50 was VERY much improved and a great product, and the n52
took the great parts of the n50 and enhanced them.  You'd be doing
yourself a favor to at least purchase a n50.

ps. The n52 has been flying off of shelves and it seems to take a day or
two some times to get them restocked.  Patience is your friend.
