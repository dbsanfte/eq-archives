If you chose to interpret positive discrimination towards certain 
minorities as negative discrimination against whites, that's your 
problem, not mine.

As for your taking it personally... Individuals suffer the consequences 
of their countries's actions all the time. You are involved in your 
government's efforts to compensate for some of the consequences of 
racism the same way that germans born after WWI suffered under war 
reparation conditions they didn't bring about, or the same way Alaska 
natives went from being Russian to being American and had no say 
whatsoever in the matter.

Would it be preferable if the police went around with racial-sensitivity 
reading devices, and only people deemed 'racist' were discriminated 
against under AA regulations, or is it better that everybody shoulders 
the burden?

You forgot to add that I probably also take candy from children and beat 
up old ladies.
