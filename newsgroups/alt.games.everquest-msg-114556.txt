Yeah.   Don't bitch about experience, or lack of experience on a raid.  Thats
not what you're there for. Groups are set up the way they are set up to have
the best chance of winning and of everyone making it through the encounter
safely.  Asking twenty to fifty people to try and play little games to control
thier damage so a kill or two finds each group is silly.   It increases the
damage everyone ends up taking in fights since things aren't dying as fast,
and prolongs the end of the raid where people can go form real experience
groups.

I forget who said it but...  Some days you're the dog, some days you're the
hydrant.  Don't worry about the "killsteal" group.  Eventually you'll find
yourself in it a few times, enough to make up for the other groups where you
end up with 1 warrior, 2 clerics and 3 enchanters.   And if you do find
yourself in the KS group, please, just enjoy it while it lasts and move on
with your life.   Advertising it to the raid won't help anyone, and will just
increase the chances of someone else feeling bad about it.
