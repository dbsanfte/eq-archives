It was the later one. When they created it they really did not think
about loot and things that much, evidenced by rubicite from cazic and
armors from lower guk being pretty much the zenith of loot. Even fear
and hate were not added for a bit after retail. They were pretty
thought to be the only armor you'd ever need since it was only for
fear/hate and the two dragons.

So back then loot was not "huge" because if you got to 50 and were a
raiding guild then you got all the stuff pretty quick. I knew people
who were near 50 or at 50 when fear and hate were added and they got
their drops there, stagnated for a bit, then quit.

So it pretty much was supposed to just be a role playing game to chat
with people, it got more complex as a result of it being so
successful. It was more or less an experiment.
