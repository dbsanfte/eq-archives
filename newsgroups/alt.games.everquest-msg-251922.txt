For a druid, kiting "really works" from level 14 on.

A tick of mana regenration / dot damage / whatever is exactly six seconds
long.

I would generally count to four (to allow for any possible lag) sit, then
stand and resume running as soon as I saw the HP / Mana bar move.

It works while running, but don't try it in melee.  Theres no way you're
going to sit down for sitting mana / health regen in between the monsters
swings.  You'll just end up getting smashed, as all hits on sitting people
land for the mob's max damage.
