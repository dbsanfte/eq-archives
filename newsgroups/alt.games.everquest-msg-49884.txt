Generally on a raid, you want one person and only one person
to act as sponge.  This simplifies the life of the clerics immensely.
Everyone else is either crowd control, debuffer, or damage
production.

This being the case, yes, generally rogues, and rangers are
preferred... except that when the main tank dies, those poor
fellows don't last long at all as backups.

As a paladin, you do qualify for main tank... if you happen
to be the guy with the most HP and highest AC on the
raid.  Helps if you are also the most experienced at that
particular raid.

Here's the funny thing.  How much damage you do is
inconsequential as main sponge.  Keeping aggro and
taking a beating are all that matters.  As a paladin, you
can stun, flash of light, root... all really irritating additions
to the taunt that don't cost you much mana.  On the other
hand, you don't have dual weild, which is one of the best
things going for aggro.  You can, at least, get ahold of
the fastest weapon you can find, and even (gasp) use a
shield, in order to up your AC.  Who cares if your
damage output drops in half, there are a dozen other
people slamming away at the mob, your job is to
stay alive and keep it beating on you and you alone.

If you aren't main tank, though, your job is to -avoid-
aggro, do as much damage as possible while allowing
the healers to concentrate on their real job.  Use a
big slow weapon if you have to, but you can probably
get away with just using the one you do the most damage
per minute with... as a paladin thats not likely to be
all -that- fast.  Don't flash or root even though you may
normally do so in groups... but do keep that stun
available to stop casters or prevent mobs from reaching
the casters if there is an aggro accident.  Be ready to
take over as main tank if necessary, although there should
be a designated secondary, and if thats not you and he
dies, your job is probably not main tank by now, but
rather "keep em off the clerics while they try to camp."

All of this, mind you, from the viewpoint of a paladin
wannabe cleric... I have a lot of paladin friends, but
I've never played one myself.
