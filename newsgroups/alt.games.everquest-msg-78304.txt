Ok. I am working diligently on my smithing - up to 179 now - by making
fine plate.  This is a VERY costly endeavor, so I try to do what I can
to minimize the time it takes between skill points. In my case, being
a level 12 cleric, my only option is pretty much a Reckless Strength
spell cast upon myself followed by a mad dash to fashion all the items
I can before that STR buff wears off and becomes a DE-BUFF for the
next 10 points of STR (yeah, it sucks but it's the best I got).

Anyway, I began another forge session in the same way last evening and
made a critical error.  I mistakenly held down the SHIFT key instead
of the CTRL key when selecting mq metal sheets, leather padding and
water flasks (only one of each was actually required) and ended up
putting 20 sheets of mq metal, 20 leather paddings and 20 flasks of
water into the forge. I hit combine without noticing my error and -
VOILA! - I was successful in creating one fine plate bracer at a cost
of approx. 450pp.

While smiling at my success on the piece, I placed the bracer into my
inventory where the mold used to be, grabbed the next mold, put it
into the forge and then went to grab the next metal
sheet/padding/water...only to notice THEY WERE ALL GONE!  Talk about
wanting to throw yourself on your sword. The only thing that saved me
was the fact that, as I stated above, I'm a cleric and therefore can't
equip a sword. So...I just knocked myself out with my smithy hammer
instead.

My point? (I know you're hoping against hope that I have one here.)
Verant has taken steps to ensure that items that will not complete a
known recipe will not combine and therefore will not be lost. Why
can't they do the same for extra items?  It is already an exercise in
EXTREME tedium and no small financial risk to make fine plate, even
for grand masters so I'm told - all to produce products which Verant
devalues on a regular basis. At level 12, 450pp is a HUGE issue for
me!  It will take me some time to recover from that one.

I want to make one thing perfectly clear: as the subject states, I did
screw up and I do realize that I am ultimately responsible, so no
flames please. However, wouldn't this be very similar to a cleric,
like myself, being able to actually equip that cool Wurmslayer, not
noticing that it is not doing any damage in combat since clerics can't
use 1hs weapons? After all, why shouldn't you be able to hold a weapon
even though you can't use it? They prevent that mistake from happening
and it wouldn't even cost you the majority of the plat you have to
your name. Why can't they put a similar safety featrue in for this
situation too?

Live and learn, I guess. I won't make THAT mistake again. :(
