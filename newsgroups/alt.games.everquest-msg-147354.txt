Which is one of the few things I can credit them for.

I am, quite frankly, fucking sick and tired of it all. It was tragic. It
was horrible.

LET IT GO.

I do not need or want to constantly be told to remember it. I am actually
watching
"The Wedding Singer" right now, simply because there is NOTHING else on TV.
Blah blah 11th blah blah Bin Laden blah blah.

You think I'm a heartless bastard? Whatever gets you through the night. But
I am sick of having this shoved down my throat. Jon Stewart (Daily Show)
had a good bit to say about it; watch that ep. if you get the chance.
