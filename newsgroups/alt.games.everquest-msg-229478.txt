I'm not entirely conviced you are right about this, see below.

Easy test for this is to take the ring off and swim around for a while. 
  You can hold your breath for quite a while, but if thats too scary, 
stay up on the surface.  Either way, your stamina bar dropped at the 
same rate, underwater or on the surface, EB or not.  What the Endurance 
bar does is anybodies' guess (untill someone tests it out, which I'm too 
lazy to do at the moment, after all it would take me a whole minute or 
so to find some water and bother to watch)

WEll, this is from years ago, I haven't been in the situation since. 
But I recall playing a cleric in Oasis, running out of food and drink, 
being broke (crocodiles don't drop cash and I wasn't looting stuff to 
sell... not that they drop much of that either), then running OOM, going 
afk, coming back a long time later and still being afk.  I'd been 
ignoring the food and drink messages since they didn't seem to have any 
effect.  I was OOS (out of stamina) and OOM and wasn't getting any mana 
-or- stamina back.  When I asked about this, I was told it was because I 
was starving that I wasn't getting stamina back, and because I was OOS 
that I wasn't getting mana back.  I didn't even have enough mana to 
summon myself one food and one drink to rectify the situation!

This effect may have been removed ages ago.  Or it may have been removed 
when the endurance bar went in.  Or it might still be there, or there 
might have been some other explaination for what I observed way back 
when, and I was given misinformation... not uncommon even today, but in 
the pre Kunark era we really were wrong about this kind of thing quite 
often.

Check to see if this is true if you've been out of food and drink long 
enough to actually be starving (just the message isn't enough, that only 
tells you that you don't have any food available to eat whenever you 
next get hungry; if you just chowed down on a fish roll and fuzzlecutter 
[breakfast of champions!] that might not become starving till tomorrow!

Splendid
