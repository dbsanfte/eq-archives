I first noticed the quests when I zoned into OT on my way somewhere
else, and heard the NPC emoting.  I went over, he conned indiff, and
I chatted with him and then went and did the FV quest and came back,
no problem.  I just had to watch out for the patrolling golem.  Later,
I tried to do it with another character and got smacked by the guards.
I thought at first it was a matter of careful positioning, and only
much later did some kind person point out that all the guards go off
duty at night, so I just needed to wait for that.
