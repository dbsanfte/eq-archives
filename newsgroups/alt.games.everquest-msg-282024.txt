It's been a long time since I've been involved in much game time but I 
understand there's been alot of changes. The last time I went into Fear with 
a group, the max level in EQ was 50.

Forgive my ignorance, but is it possible for the following group of three to 
survive Fear long enough for the Shaman's epic.1 drop, or would it be one of 
those coveted "what the hell were we thinking" moments?

60 Shaman (no epic)
62 Druid
55 Warrior
