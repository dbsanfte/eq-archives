I've got a 54 erudite enchanter.  I've been waiting forever for those
erudite cultural items they mentioned so so long ago. 

Erudin sucks, it's always sucked, it will probably always suck.  

On the upside, I went through about 5 enchanters of various races before
I found one I could get past lv 6 - it was an erudite.  Eruidite
enchanters are the bomb at low levels comparatively speaking.  

That being said, tell her to get her ass up to the nexus and go
somewhere else.  Anywhere. Really.  Kill wisps, go to uguk or feerrot to
kill froggies for thier cloth, go hunt in the kitty newb zone for the
silks, go to the warrens, go to everfrost and hunt wolves and bears
(that's what I did) Go hunt somewhere else. Anywhere.  But stay the hell
away from Erudin and Toxilla.  All Erudin is good for is a spot to buy
batwings, fish scales and spells.
