> Necros' can't quad kite.
> Sure they are, as long as it's a static single spawn on a six minute
timer.

necros dont need too . A necro can pull and kill singles every 60 seconds .
He also ends full mana and full health . rate of kill can easily reach 12
per 15 minutes . A druid on the other hand can quad kite 4 (takes a fair
amount of skill , at the very least much more difficult than the necro is
doing ) and then med for 12 minutes . A rate of kill above 4 every 15
minutes is very hard to achieve as a druid .

Shamans can slow a mob land a dot and med while the pet kills the mob . He
can generally handle a mob every 2 minutes or so . ( a rate of kill of 8
every 15 minutes )

Magicians can just send the pet in and then after it has killed the mob let
the pet rest to full health . A rate of kill approaching 6 per 15 minutes .

Enchanters (yep yep me ) can cheat . I can do what the shaman does but not
quite as well . Or if im feeling frisky i can load up some serious spells .
Walk up to a 6 spawn and charm the strongest mob there . Area mez the other
5 mobs and watch my fresh pet go to work . This is actually significantly
harder than quad kiting with my druid since it never works out quite as well
as plannned, but I have and could do again :p Nothing else is more fun than
making the true solo classes green with envy as walking up to a full camp
that they would be terrified to take , breaking it and then saying there ya
go now you can kill the respawn .

I think I have mentioned several times that my druid is harder to level and
significantly less powerfull than either my chanter or my monk. It is sad
that some people just dont seem to get it . The druids are dissappearing in
large numbers . Where at low levels they are a dime a dozen at high levels
they are almost extinct. I frequently go to raids with my druid because one
is nice to have and no others are there. And yet people wonder why it is
becoming harder and harder to gain a port :p
