Ok, different animal. But I would still maintain that they know far more
about how to get software out the door and into the hands of paying
customers than most game companies, and this is what is making them strong
players in the gaming market. They may not code the games, but they know how
to hold the right people accountable for delivering customer valued code,
that's what counts.

Trust me, Microsoft knows the PC game industry. I regularly participate in
playtesting many of the games that get discussed here and have spent much
time there over the last few years watching them evolve from their "Flight
Sim" and "Fury" days to their current stage. I've had these arguments with
Ed Fries and I've seen firsthand the transformation that he went through
before retiring earlier this year. These guys have not arrived where they
are solely on the backs of companies that they've acquired, they thoroughly
embrace the acquired domain expertise and make it their own. What do you
think happens to the people within a company like FASA when they acquire it?
Companies are not just abstract entities, they're just people bonded
together in a common enterprise and in this case Microsoft is smart enough
to know that they need gamers in there making key decisions. A lot of these
guys are gamers. Not all of them, most of the ones in the right places.

I didn't blame retailers or customers. I agree with your overall sentiment
that the industry shot itself in the foot, mostly because the smell of money
attracted everyone and, well, not everyone is talented or smart. Newsflash!

Again, I agree. It's not about the quality of the manual, it's about the
cost. The two are not synomymous. There are plenty of examples of
outstanding manuals that came in 2-color (black and white), low cost formats
(SMAC's a good example, as I recall it was over 200p of quality). Then there
are those 4-color monstrosities that offered nothing but cut and paste
regurgitation, worthless but looked pretty as hell (look at the SWG manual,
or some of the Avalon Hill games back when they were still trying to put out
PC games).  When your take on a game is like $10 after distribution,
spending a 40-50% of that on COGS that don't deliver value will kill you.

It's not any of those things alone, it's all of them. It's a mindset issue.
It's about treating the game business AS a business, where all decisions are
made based on value delivered for investment made, whether it's the
packaging or the corporate payroll.

Um, where exactly am I denying that they had an impact? I asked you a simple
question. Name me something that they delivered to the marketplace that was
truly innovative, as opposed to delivering something to the market that had
been done before and established as commercially viable, but not as
successfully executed and marketed.

Yeah, it has never has been and never will be, but it'll continue making a
fair amount of noise (witness EverQuest II ads in movie theaters now) on its
way to evolving into something that can and will be mainstream. Probably
another platform yet to be invented and closer to the convergent holy grail
we keep hearing about.
