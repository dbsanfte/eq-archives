That is because they used code developed by Microsoft for Internet 
Explorer. With CSS3 w3 standard, menus like the one your describing can 
be created using open standards.

Mozilla 0.9.4 Java loads up for the first time when you first visit a 
website to speed up initial startup times for the browser. It freezes 
for a second or two then loads, and java is loaded into memory from that 
point forward. Hell Internet Explorer on Windows XP doesn't even support 
Java at all.

IE 6.x = faily stable, used by a lot of people (most still use IE5), 
very insecure, does not support open standards, does not support full 
PNG image standards, ignores standard HTML errors, you cannot uninstall 
it without a 3rd party utility, uninstalling it makes a crippling blow 
to the features of the OS. No Java support on Windows XP. No support for 
classic style plugins. Active-X support.

NS 4.x = Old, doesn't support the newest standards (well duh, it is 
almost a decade old). Unstable, fair speed, good Java support, support 
for classic style plugins.

NS 6.1 = Browser faster then both IE and former versions. Supports even 
the very latest CSS standards, full PNG image support, fully Java2 
support, skinnable, advanced cookie management support, partial active-x 
support, still some bugs to work out, based upon the Mozilla 0.9.2.1 source.

Mozilla 0.9.4 = Browser faster then both IE/NS6 and former versions. 
Supports even the latest CSS standards, full CSS supports, XUL support, 
Active-X support, Java 2 support, classic style plugins support, support 
for blocking advertisments, support for blocking pop-up windows (all or 
just onload and onunload), advanced cookie management system, skinnable, 
open source (plus for all you good programmers out there), tabbed views 
support (in beta).


I have imported with Mozilla 0.9.4 and it does not do that *shrug* You 
also have the option to have Mozilla 0.9.4 load into memory. So start up 
times when you click on the icon are the same as Internet Explorer.

Hmm, I am using Mozilla 0.9.4 and it works just fine. No problem at all.

Okay then why not. Mozilla 0.9.4 is way better then Internet Explorer 
3.0. That must mean Internet Explorer totally sucks ass huh?

I don't really want to post my Apache access_log. I am using a client 
based log parser, does not output page avaible over the web or even in 
html format.
