The GF4 MX supports 8.1.  It just doesn't do all the features in hardware.  
It's essentially a clocked-up GeForce 2 (two-year-old technology at this 
point), and has little to do with a real GF4 as far as capabilities go.  As 
for the benchmarks, they don't really tell you the whole story.  For the 
newer crop of games, a GF3 or GF4 (not MX) will leave a GF2 or GF4 MX 
behind.

If you're really that money conscious, wait for the GF4 Ti4400, which 
should be at the $200 price point.  It'll beat a GF3 Ti500 handily.  
Alternately, wait until the Ti4400 comes out and buy the GF3 Ti500 at a 
"we're discontinuing this card" sale.  Otherwise, if you don't want to 
wait, go for the GF3 Ti200.
