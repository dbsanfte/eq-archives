It was easy for me to distance myself from my server's rant boards.  There's
a few people who delight in posting anti-Semitic rants, telling us all the
Holocaust was a hoax, etc.  Or endless boring political debates.  Almost
nothing related to in-game stuff at all.  Heck, most of the active posters
don't even play EQ any more.  It's easy to avoid posting on the Drinal rant
boards.

I find myself reading *other* server's rant boards, though.  Like Quellios
or Brell, who both have decent rant boards.  Alas I don't participate too
much because I'm an outsider after all.  But I love reading them.  =)
