As a macroing device, they all basically work the same so whatever is
cheapest or easiest to get is probably the best you need. Unless they
changed the cheapo buttons, which the pictures and at least one review
I've read on the n52 imply they haven't, they're a crappy controller, as
the button action will kill your tendons really quickly compared to a
computer keyboard. I guess that's why they're so cheap, they sure don't
spend much on parts. I've had an n45 since they came out and very
quickly realized how quickly the action put a strain on the tendons in
my wrist.  It's spent the last year and a half being my occasional macro
controller, before they even had the click to stop macro setting in the
macro software I just had a rubber band hold down a key to keep looping
macros.
