A good, experienced druid is always useful in a group, they can heal,
snare, put out respectable damage, track, evac, cast damage shields...
A bad druid can get the group killed, especially if they're counting
on him to be the main healer. Unfortunately, if you've solo'd up to
56, you probably fall into the bad (grouping) druid category. There's
really only one way to fix that, you have to group and pay your dues.
Preferrably, make sure that you have a paladin/cleric in the group
that can rez. You will screw up (everyone does) and it's a lot easier
for everyone to live with it if you can just rez and get on with
things after a screwup. 

On a more general level, your priorities in most groups should be:
1) Healing (gets easier at 58 with your new heal)
2) Snaring
3) Crowd Control (snare a mob to get agro, lead it off to the side and
root park it) 
4) Dealing damage

Often (or all) of the first 3 on the list will be covered by someone
else in the group but when it all hits the fan, it's usually a pretty
good check list to go down. You make sure that everything else is
taken care of before using your mana to deal damage. 

Overall, just jump in and do some groups and warn the group leader
that you're new at this. If he isn't an ass he should be able to help
you out with some what your role should be until you get a feel for
things. 

Good Luck, 

Frank
