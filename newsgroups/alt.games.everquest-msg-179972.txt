I know this is gonna be a rant and that many will flame me but gonna get it
off my chest anyway.  Just came from yet another Hate raid where we killed
all the minis and Inny (a not too easy feat for my guild) and you guessed it
no Shattered Emerald of Corruption again.   Now if this were the first or
second time this had happened I would shrug my shoulders and walk away.  For
me this is about the 12th time with Inny alone and the 30 or 40th raid total
without getting a stone.  In all I have seen one of these fall in all of
that time.   What is up with this?  If you do the work and get to the end
and "strike at the heart of Innoruuk" like the quest says you should be
guaranteed the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.   I realize that the ranger
epic is by no means the most difficult in the game but this particular part
is really frustrating me today.  The going rate to multiquest it on my
server at this point is 60k which I dont have and even if I did I wouldnt
pay.  SoE needs to really look at the epics and make them realistic.  Rant
off thanks for listening.
