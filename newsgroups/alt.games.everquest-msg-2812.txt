Geforce 2 ultra (the near 300 bucks one) was supposed to get a huge
price drop (basically they will be selling them at a loss) when
geforce 3 is out. If geforce 3 is out you should soon be able to buy
geforce 2 ultra which is much better than the regular geforce 2 at
like half its normal price (more like 150 bucks or less at the new
price) You have the exact same setup as me and that is what I'm
planning on doing (waiting for geforce 2 ultra price to plummet when 3
is out)

As far as audio I don't know.. except the SB live is a better card I
guess than pci128 (which I also have.. and is kindy goofy but ok) I
just never cared that much about audio and find the pci 128 to be a
fine card. I think the speakers you get make more of a diff than the
card kinda.
