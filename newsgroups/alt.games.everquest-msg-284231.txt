There is a very helpful summary of (almost?) all elements of game play 
called FAQ maintained by Don Woods and posted here regularly.

This is a link to the web based version of these FAQ.  I think you will find 
it helpful.

http://www.icynic.com/~don/EQ/age.faq.htm

And, your perspective on the game as a newcomer could direct Don with future 
changes or additions to the FAQ.  Just post here.
