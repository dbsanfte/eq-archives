You want more than 256Mb of RAM to run XP.  256 is fine if you only
surf the web, but once you load-up something large and hoggish like
Everquest, add another 150+ megs, and you're out of RAM.

Hard drive thrashing is rarely CPU related -- if the CPU was overloaded
it would not be able to thrash the disk.  In all liklihood, you're
running out of RAM and the system is paging to the swap file on the
hard drive, hence the HD thrashing and super-slow response of the
system.

Go to Best Buy (or similar) and drop the $30 on another 256 stick
of RAM.  It's the cheapest upgrade and it's likely your problem.
