Well we usually have the same people coming to each raid, the problems we
are having (well, havent had yet, so the forseeable problems) is that if
everyone can roll on an item that is an upgrade, one  person could, with
lucky rolls, win every single item they roll on!

This has not happened as of yet, and being fairly small we all know each
other pretty well, and around half the time loot is sorted without a roll.

The main problem I think will be all/all loot.
