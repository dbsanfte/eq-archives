I just picked up a Prophecy Scroll in TOFS two nights ago, so now, most of
the time, I am not wielding any weapon anymore.  I still keep the Beetle
Stinger handy for when I am soloing, and need to finish off a mob, but the
scroll gives me 4 more wisdom than the weapon.  Last night I lost on a roll
for a Spine Chill Spear, which would have been a nice compromise between the
two.  I will have to hunt some more there to see about getting one.
