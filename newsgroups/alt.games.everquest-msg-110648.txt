But just to warn you, they aren't mentioning some of its problems,
namely the horrible language barrier at the start (no one knows Common
and the race languages take some time to learn) and the insane
difficulty in finding pickup groups. Forget other dungeons if you're
not in a guild that treads off the beaten path - you're going to be
stuck with the idiot cycle in Kunark or you'll be soloing. This server
has numbers BARELY better than Sullon Zek, and its skill level is
lower on average as well, if that matters to you. Its uberguilds are
as bad as any other server's, worse than some (and they are often
fighting publicly, no roleplaying there just your usual uberguild
quarrels) And finally, not everyone roleplays and not everyone has
tolerant views on how you may roleplay.

Maybe you'll be able to overcome that; lots of people could, but I
couldn't. There's a good reason it's at or near the bottom in servers.
