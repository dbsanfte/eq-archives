Almost certainly the card....Live uses the CPU much harder than many
cards available, particualrly in areas with ambient sound....I
upgraded mine to an Audigy for just this reason, after several techy types
in my guild went hunting their choppiness problem and came down to that.

The improvement was VERY noticeable and I was after I added 256 Meg of RAM
to my pre-exsting 128, less chopiness....for no real benefit on that frot
(the memory improved model numbers and zoning in a big way but not this
chopping in noisy zones)
