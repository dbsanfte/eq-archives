Ok so account expired, cannot play EQ, no problem, pay again, play again,
simple...

Follow subscribe again prompts, simple...

AHH!

Cannot make payment though as

""Your current subscription must expire in order to use Global Collect.""

WTF? Thought account had expired???

Oh well follow instructions, simple...

""To do this, go to the game interface and cancel your current subscription.
You will then have to wait for it to expire. Please note that you will still
have access to EverQuest until the account expires. Once your current
subscription is expired, you will be prompted to re-subscribe. You may
select any pricing plan you wish, or change your method of payment.

Your characters will not be affected in any way by canceling or changing
your billing.

If you are still having problems after visiting this support section, you
can contact our Technical Support Department via email using our online form
<>""


MMM, apparently I cannot cancel account, as I "do not possess a current
active account".

Ah yes, they told me that when I tried to play game....

So, tried whole process again, and vicious circle began...

Any advice please??
