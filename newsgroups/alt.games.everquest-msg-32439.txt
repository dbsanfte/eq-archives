Good tanks will however turn and take the mob off.
If the tanks don't get the mob off you explain it to them, if they
continue to ignore you disband.
Also, All clerics should have a hot key that says "MOB ON ME! I can't cast!"
Sometimes in hectic battles its hard to tell who is being hit by what,
You know when you are being hit, the tank sometimes can't tell
when a mob has switched targets, especially in tight dungeon
rooms.

Ok that's a dumb move on the clerics or casters part, casting on a mob is
just going to piss it off more and root has a HUGE taunt value and it
breaks too easily. The caster is just making the tanks job harder.

If you are a caster and/or you want a MOB that is attacking you
off of you, you MUST do 4 things:

1)Don't run around like a chicken with your head cut off! If you run the
  MOB moves out of melee range of the tank and he has to turn and run
  around after it. Also, you may run out of the range of the healer trying
  to heal you. Let the tank stay in melee range of the MOB.

  If you are outdoors and you have SoW and a little more room to move then
  move in a circle. Keeping the other group members in the center and drag
  the MOB around them so that the casters are all still in spell range of the
  MOB and you.

2)STOP attacking it! And STOP casting spells on it! This is important!
  Don't panic! The tank can't get the MOB off of you if you keep pissing it
  off! The tank has to move himself up the hate list and he can't do that
  if you keep angering the MOB.

3)Face the MOB, and DON'T turn your back on it!

4)Give the Tank or Rogue a chance to take a few swings on the MOB then back
  away a short distance. If the mob follows you stop and try again.

Very true.

Unfortunately unless you have SoW running will only make you die
faster. It is amazing to me how many people don't get that. If you
run you had better be very close to a zone or you better have sow.

Unfortunately if the tanks don't listen to you then you have to simply leave
the group. Other clerics and casters will thank you.
