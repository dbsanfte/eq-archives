And the patch message from July 10, 2003, is where SOE announced
that Extended Affliction was being replaced by Burning Affliction,
so I think there aren't any Extended Affliction items any more.
(I suspect people were getting annoyed at how 20% extension on a
9-tick dot got rounded down to 1 extra tick.  But frankly, if it's
a random 1-20% extra damage instead of a straight +20%, that's
just about as bad.  All the other focus effects have their full
effect every time, or at least, that's what I thought.  Does a
10% mana preservation item save 1-10% at random, or 10% every time?
Does a +10% Extended Buff item (I forget the name of the effect)
give +10% duration every time, or a random extension of 1-10%?

The extra damage is still nice, but I admit I was expecting a bit
more bang for my buck.  (A bit more punch for my plat? :)
