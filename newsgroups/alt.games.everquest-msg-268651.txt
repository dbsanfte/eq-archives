This is the Access Quest that flags you for the Firemyst Gully zone, given 
by Ignar Steadirt, the dwarf at the Antonica Claymore. It's a 3-part quest. 
Part 1 involves running around talking to 3 different NPCs and then 
reporting back to Ignar. Part II requires killing Sabertooth runecasters 
until you get a random journal update. When that happens your journal will 
tell you to return to Ignar. Report to him and get Part III, which requires 
killing Darkpaw runecasters until you get the final random journal update. 
When that's done, report back to Ignar, who will then direct you to go speak 
with his brother at the entrance to Firemyst for completion of the quest.

If you exit Blackburrow and turn left, after a while you'll run right into 
the big doors that lead into the Firemyst Gully.
