Bill, if it's any consolation, back when my warrior was oh... about
forty levels higher than your paladin, I walked into LFay on my way to
go poke around in Mistmoore. I ran a couple hundred yards along the wall
and was suddenly dead before I realized what the hell was happening.
Don't feel alone there, friend. Lesser Fey is just one of those "cross
your eyes, grit your teeth, and hope you make it" sort of zones. Though
with experience in the game, later on you'll learn to minimize your
risks when travelling there.
