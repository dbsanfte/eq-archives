Horses in EverQuest? Computer Games Article
Soneldar Blackrose [8/31/2001-3:00:02 PM]  Comments[45] 

You mean as of Luclin, instead of running, we could be riding in the
moonlight on the shore of the Lake of Ill Omen? Apparently so. Computer
Games' new issue this month (Issue #131, Oct 2001, cover feature
Civilization 3) has talked to Jeff Butler, who is the Producer for SoL,
and has confirmed that there are horses that can be ridden in game.

Now, if you think there is going to be just one horse size, there will
be three. The smaller races, such as halflings, will get a pony. Humans
and anyone around that height gets a steed, and Trolls/Ogres seem to get
a big warhorse.

As for improvements to character, Butler has said that the only thing
being added while on horseback is movement rate. If you are going to run
away on horseback from a MoB though, be prepared: The EQ team is
adjusting the movement rates of all MoBs. The horse will essentially be
part of character model.

Also, to be noted, the horse can only summoned in the outdoors away from
cities, and also does not have its own set of hitpoints of stats, and
cannot act as a bank. Word says that horses won't be cheap, either. Each
horse has their own set movement rate, the higher the rate, the higher
the cost.
