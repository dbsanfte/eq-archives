Hehe, come over to Veeshan and give me one. Go for 18K on Veeshan, just 
too cheap to buy one, when guild can easily raid CoM, just need to get 
them to go there :).
Last raid we got SO unlucky, killed only 3 reavers, each of them spawned 
ghosts after first kill, no reaver drops.
Probably sound wierd, but i only need a jade reaver, Froglok Essence 
from Ulump, and Faydedar to get my epic. Isnt it more common to get the 
reaver before you get the item from VSR, or the seahorse in KK?
