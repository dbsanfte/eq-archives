Shaman slows are mostly magic resist, with a couple disease resist ones, 
but the biggest slow is magic resist.  Cure disease line of spells is 
used to remove the slows.  Other than the GoD slow, none have a resist 
modifier for the shaman, should be the same resist chance as enchanter 
slows assuming mobs are not tashed or malo-xed.  Some LDoNs I get lots of 
resists, others I get very few.
