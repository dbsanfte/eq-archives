You forgot to mention that said corporate takeover then proceeded to
rip out everything that was unique to the design of Horizons and
turned it into what has been described as SWG's crafting system in a
EQ skin, devoid of content, depth or originality.

In fact the current revews of Horizons backs his viewpoint up quite
nicely - another EQ clone with nothing to indicate any staying power
beyond people being tired of everything else and desperate for any
kind of change.

David Allen WAS a fruitcake, but he dared to try something different,
and was shot down because 1. he's got the charisma and common sense of
a Derek Smart wannabe, and 2. the guys controlling the purse strings
wanted a piece of the EQ pie, not a new market.

He supported his post with numbers. You may not agree with it but that
doesn't change the fact he supported himself better than say... you.
