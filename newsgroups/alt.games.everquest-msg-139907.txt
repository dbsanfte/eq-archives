Actually, once one reaches 51.  All of them can, and eventually will, hit
50, so long as you have trained at least one point into all of them.  If you
have not trained at least one point in all of them, then none of them will
ever exceed 50.  Not all trainers will train specialization.  In particular,
for enchanters, the shadowhaven and sanctus seru trainers have a limited set
of skills they will train you in, and it does not include specialization.
