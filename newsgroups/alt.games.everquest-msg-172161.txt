That's good advice.  I did the SFG Druid quests on FV, and it was the
pits (TLC didn't help, the Blackburrow drops mostly came from greens
so I had to scavenge and buy from other players).  I was actually
worse off than the Rangers hunting for the Giant Field Rats because I
did not have track (actually I gave up on the last two pieces until
I made 20 and did have track, came back then to complete the set).

One piece of advice for the OP:  as far as I could tell all of the rats
in QH were coming from the same spawn points, every rat there is a PH
for the Giant Field Rats.  So, if you want those whiskers, kill every
rat you see.  Also, there are a lot of different quest bits that drop
off the critters there, including several other rat parts, which sell
to vendors for over 2 gold each and thus are actually decent loot for
a non-twinked lowbie.  So loot everything that isn't NODROP, as well
as the NODROPs you need for your own quests, and use the cash to buy
gear from other players (vendor-sold Leather armor is an okay value
also, because you can later sell it to a vendor for nearly as much as
you paid for it once you've gotten better stuff).
