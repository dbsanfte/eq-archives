Did forget to post this; using Win2K, so I meet this spec.

PIII 450, meet/slightly exceed this spec.

320mb RAM, exceed this spec.

Did have ATI Radeon 7000, didn't meet this one (of course, I also don't have
GoD installed), switched out last night with an NVidia GeForce 2; meet this
spec now.

I dunno, I meet all these requirements, and yet I'm still crashing when it
rains. Just checked my char who was set up in trader through EQIM, and he's
no longer online, so I just got a non-rain-related crash, apparently, unless
a patch is going on.

Anyway, thanks for looking those specs up. :)
