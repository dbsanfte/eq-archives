That is a good point, but I frequently solo, and I make a point of 
getting somewhere as free of adds as possible before going into BW mode. 
  This might be worth doing for me.  Is it really minutes? 110 is only 
11 seconds, so at most this macro eats 44 seconds (plus another 4 or so 
in mysteriously wasted time, I guess).

Also, what actually locks up while a macro is running, just other 
macros, or all hotkeys?  How about autoattack using the actual attack 
key?  How about the action window?  I wouldn't mind losing the socials, 
if thats all there is to it, I primarly use them for assist and for 
calling for assist, both of which I can do by typing a fairly quick line 
/assist or /g tanking %t... and neither of which is needed when soloing 
anyway.
