The number of times it is useful at lower level, solo/single group 
situations is fairly low.  Next time, see if you can find a friendly caster 
that has a poison resist buff to buff you.  Shaman, Necro, Cleric, Druid 
all have poison resist buffs, probably some of the hybrids too, although 
they get them at higher levels than the pure casters generally.
