By what justifaction?

My car is parked in an underground lot at the moment... its locked, 
alarmed, and clubbed... i figure a determined theif would take around a 
minute to steal it. If he then used it to run down some kids you think 
I'm somehow responsible, 'at least to the degree of losing my right to 
ownership of the car'?

Worse, that's where SOE currently stops the investigation. They'd 
confiscate my car punishing the owner for no good reason, and let the 
theif/driver go scott-free because he's harder to track.
