Erm Barnacle, are you sure about this? Is flat rate the one where you pay a
monthly fee (roughly ï¿½12 or so, I forget the exact amount) and don't get
charged for the length of time you're online?

If so, then I'm not sure you're correct in this. The reason I say this is
because I'm in the UK and I use AOL (paying a monthly fee for unlimited
access) and I don't getting cut off after 45 mintues. For example, I was
playing EQ last night for about 5 hours solid and I didn't get cut-off.  I
had no problems playing. I also stay online fregularily for  5, 6 or more
hours at a time d/l stuff. Again I don't get cut off. I've been online right
now for about the last hour and 20 minutes and again, no cut off.

I've been with AOL since last Christmas and as far as I know they've always
had an auto disconnect due to inactivity. If you weren't doing anything
(i.e. sufring, d/l stuff etc.) after about 20 minutes (I think) a pop-up
window appeared asking if you wanted to stay online and if you didn't click
yes you got disconnected.

Cheers,

Dave
