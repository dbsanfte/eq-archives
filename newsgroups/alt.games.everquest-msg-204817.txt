Don't overestimate the Hole, if you have a puller that's familiar with
the place you can do it with a duo. Alternately, if you have a 60+
cleric and pally/SK to help, you can paradrop in. Both DA and jump in
the hole from Paneel, kill the 4 roamers at the bottom and you have
about 10 mobs to get through to get to the undead tower. IVU and run
up. Kirn is an easy duo for high 50s shaman/tank.

I'd assume max ally for the tear. It might not be quite max but the
final turnin has your true-spirit faction maxed out.

2 of the 3 mini-bosses can spawn the child, I forget which two though.
That's the only fight in the shaman epic that can't be duo'd these
days.
