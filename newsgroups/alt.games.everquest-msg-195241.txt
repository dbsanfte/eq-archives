Don't know, but at first I heard no transfers for six months.  Now I'm
hearing 12 months.  This was the latest on it posted at eq.crgaming.com:
__________________________________________
This just in from the EQ Live website:
  We've decided that this will be a no transfer server. After 12 months we
will review the situation on the server in case there needs to be a change
to this policy, but it is our intent to not allow transfers to the server.

  Thanks to everyone in the EverQuest community for your feedback on this
and other issues, we appreciate knowing what you want from your game.

This should make the new server gain a much more solid economy, particularly
with the great tradeskills now available to players.

I may actually start a playing again just to see how things are on the new
server once it comes up.
