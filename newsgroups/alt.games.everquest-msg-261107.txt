How did you think Windows Shutdown ends up with the PC turned off (on 
newer machines... well newer than 1998ish)? Magic? :p

Actually the main 'victim irritant' of a recent virus payload was that 
it shut windows down after just a few moments (long enough to try and 
spread 20,000 times, but not long enough for the user to update his 
antivirus software or do anything else meaningful. (It wasn't an instant 
off mind you... but still...)
