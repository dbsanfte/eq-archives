I actually agree with you. I can see how the post 60 endgame can be
fun, and I have no intention of quitting at that point! But for me, I
can't imagine it would be half as much fun without having made the
journey to get there. Where would the sense of achievement be? 

As a small point though, it's interesting to note the demands made on
players by some of the uber guilds. As you mentioned, those three are
indeed the top ubers on Quellious, but I can't say I've bothered to
investigate their rules. However, I've seen websites of other uber
guilds who lay out some pretty draconian demands on play time and
availabilty. While I understand the reasons for this, it starts to
sound far less like enjoyment to me, and much more like a job.
