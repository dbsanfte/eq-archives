Yes, well, I bought it for my HS key (I think that's the one).  I got to use
it for 20 minutes before I turned it in along with the drop off Xalgoz in
return for the key.  I then went to LoIO the next morning, and got me a new
one.  Having just spent 1k on the one I bought, I sold the new one.  Back to
the Beetle Stinger for me.

Smithing - 177
Brewing - 168
Pottery - 163ish
Baking - 135
Tailoring - 54ish (OK, I still suck at this one, but the 6th shawl is
calling to me)
Fletching - 203 (On my ranger, need to do this for the shawl quests on my
main)
Jewelcraft - 0 (Someday, when I have money, need it for the shawl quests)

The pottery, baking, brewing, and fletching are pretty trivial to do, just
time consuming.  The fletching is by far the most expensive of the easy
ones, and that cost me 1.5kpp or so, with a Wisdom of between 131 and 146.
