You can still get tasks at 66.  I did a "medium" one last night.  I had to
find some ruins in BW, then kill 10 skeletons and collect 4 bone chips in
Chardok, and then turn in 4 bone chips to an npc in BW.  The direction to
the NPC was marked on my compass.  For my trouble I recieved 1% of level 66
(at 100% to regular xp) and 115ish plat.
