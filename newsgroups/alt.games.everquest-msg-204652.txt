That's fine for you.  What about all the players who vastly prefer
have quality content that changes occasionally to mind-numbing
mediocrity that's in constant flux?  For that matter, while adding
variety to spawn tables and spawn locations would be a good thing,
imo, how does this equate to "content"?  I'm having difficulty
imagining any interest at all in a global storyline that reads
"Random things will spawn and attempt to kill you, good luck
citizen!".  I'm not saying that EQ has been great, or even good,
at producing compelling storylines that integrate with the more
mechanical content (quests and loot).  But abandoning this as a
goal seems likely to severely limit a game's appeal, if there are
no milestones (or merit badges, or whatever you wanna call them)
why are people gonna continue after the first 6 or 12 months?
