Hey I hope they have a long term plan too. But the point I was agreeing too
was that if the game company promotes a feature as a main part of the game
and doesn't have it ready at beta or even at launch calling it modular
doesnt make the excuse warranted.

Absolutely. I will never forget clicking enter game and being on a Kelethin
pad.
1st MMOG etc etc etc...
I got the game 30 days after release and started on FR.
I still get all nostalgic when I find myself hearing Gfay music while
running thru the forest.

I have now come to the conclusion that those that want to be at max level
should really have an instant level 100 or whatever button. My playstyles
dont tend to mix well with theirs.

As far as how advanced we are in MMOG's I tried the Guildwars open trial
afew months ago.
By the second day there was allready an economy with only a few items but it
was only a 3 or 4 day public trial.
