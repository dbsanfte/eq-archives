I was goofing around in EC the other day, somebody /auc WTB 3 orcs, I
/auc wtb Guild, I get a /tell what level are you.  I'm 11 so Thats how I
responded, next /tell is come to second torch, you're in, I /r I don't
know you, and you don't know me, I think its a bit pre-mature to be
joining your guild, /tell Why??.  /r Well, I think its good to get to
know the guild, and the guild to know me before I join.  /tell whatever.

DOH!!

learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
