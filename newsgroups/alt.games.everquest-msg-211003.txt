I too don't think the warriors ability to take damage balances the safety
factor.

Ben says he found the cut off to be about level 40 for his warrior and that
seems as good a point as any.

I haven't seen a lot of posts ~'I waited for 1 1/2 hours last night trying
to find a group for my warrior' lately and I think it is because people have
learned their lesson. I just don't think it is a lesson that has to be
learned so much as fixed.

For me, I have always found it easier to get breeze/clarity/... type spells
cast on my magic users then it is for something with regeneration.

I really think it can and should be fixed. I haven't checked recently, but I
assume things like healing potions that were ~19 pp are still far to over
priced to be useful.
