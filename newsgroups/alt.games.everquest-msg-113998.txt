This is ridiculous! This is the THIRD night in a row I cannot play EQ 
because of patches, patches and more patches. Why can't these 
incompetant morons test their patches BEFORE they patch??? They are 
worse than Microsoft!

They insist on continually patching at the most inconvenient time too, 
timed to start when I get home, and finish way after I go to bed. Why 
can't they rotate the patch times so its not always the same people who 
are inconvenienced?? What are we paying for here when we can't use the 
service??

Pathetic.
