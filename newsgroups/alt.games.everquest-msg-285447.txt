First remove blank plate from the back end.  otherwise you won't be
able to plug the monitor into the card!

A few may not need the extra power connector but if it doesn, hook it
up.  I think all PCI-e needs extra power.

I'd suggest letting the store do it.  That way if something goes
wrong, they'd have to fix it and figure it out, not you.  While 90% of

will need extra work and trying to figure out murphy's law can be
maddening for those not experienced with computers.
