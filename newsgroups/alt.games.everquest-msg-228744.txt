I can't see why they're refunding IRE unless standard reclaiming of pets
will now work like IRE meaning that IRE is now meaningless.  I wonder if, to
some degree, this nerf/fix wasn't sparked by the very heated complaints of
those who bought IRE only to find that it had a disastrous effect on their
ability to canni.  There were perhaps no posts that had as much anger on the
Magician's Tower as a player that just bought IRE and found canni was now
trashed.  I can only imagine the feedbacks and emails that must have also
been written.  In the end, canni probably died from its own press clippings.
It was something that was just too good not to get a lot of attention, but
the attention doomed it.

I didn't canni much, but I have to admit the times when I did it really came
in handy.  I had hoped to one day try the nuke/canni strategy in LDoN on a
hard mission where the mobs last a little longer.  This won't really change
my playstyle, but it was always great to know that in case of emergency
(i.e. an LDoN wipe) a full mana bar wasn't far away.  I will miss it.
