So what's obviously missing? Hmm..
Feir'Dal Sewing Kit (wood elf cultural)
Light Burlap Sack
Sparkle Purse (I think this is a container... for burning rapier quest)
the one you can quest for in Kerra Ridge
oh, and the one off the guano harvester in SolB that holds small stuff
and there's a Box of Nil Space in Sebilis, neh?
as well as a few god/dragon dropped ones
