    Stun and/or Root. If you really want to see a spider do a 180 degree
turn, sit down as he begins to pull it away. :-)

    If you Root the spider it'll face whoever is closest. As you can well
imagine, there's all sorts of ways to mess with the rogue then.

    They're aggroed from the ramps. See the Sentinels in front of the castle
when you're up at Frenzy? Lob a javelin at one of them, and watch the fun.
IF Tents knows what's coming, they can squish into one corner and escape
what's coming. And since most trains that go to the zoneout area end up
stuck behind the zone anyways, Tents usually doesn't get creamed by stuff
going home. Usually.

    We had an Asian guild on our server that was very good at training with
their monks and necromancers. One European who once was in their guild
reported that they loved to say "move them" whenever anyone was in a spot
they wanted. Like Fear.

> For a 60 monk I have a really good rep as far as trains are concerned

    On our server if a monk gets a bad train rep the GMs usually watch them
like a hawk until they mess up. The only person I can think of that trained
everywhere he went and never got busted was Choppa, and he was just insane.
I swear, I was never in a zone with him without hearing about SOMEONE being
trained.
