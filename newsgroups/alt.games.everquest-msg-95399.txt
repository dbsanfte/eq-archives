I was in LOIO with my 20 Enchanter for the first time the other night.  The
first thing I noticed is that shouting "ENC LFG" gets alot of replys.  I got
into a Sarnak Fort group almost instantly.  Monk, War, Cleric, Druid, Enc
(me), and a Bard.  I was the baby of the group, and most of  the pulls were
yellow or red to me.  The druid decides to cast an AOE spell on the 2 mezzed
recruits (they were just standing together after all) when the melee's were
attending to an Adherent.  After they aggro the cleric, who decided to fight
back instead of just letting me re-mez, I finally regain control after as I
go OOM.  The monk was so annoyed, that he decided to give a wonderful lesson
to everyone in the group on working with enchanters.  After a lesson about
how not to break mez and what my specific job was, he proceeded to give
step-by-step instructions on how to set up an assist button with him as the
target and how not to attack other mobs, even when they were attacking the
cleric.  I didn't have to say a word in over 2 minutes of schooling.  I was
so impressed that I sent a tell to the monk thanking him for the
instructions and told him that he was an enchanter's dream groupie.

You should have seen the fireworks after the bard broke a mez just before
camping!

Moral of the story, is that not all tanks are bad mez breakers .... haven't
decided about druids yet.
