A 60 SK in my guild was there last night.  He was unable to get the mobs 
off the enchanters.  They resorted to Amnesia and root.  The mobs have 
very low MR, and the courtyard mobs could be controlled with AE mez.  We 
have already formulated a decent strategy based on this info, which we 
hope to try out tonight.  Mobs further in require GoK for CC, which may 
make things a bit trickier.  
I'm actually hoping that this will be one of the zones where a bard is 
better CC than an enchanter, especially since most of the mobs are level 
54 or below.  (Bard mez only works on mobs 55 or below.)
Apparently CT is once again the trainfest we all know and love from our 
first characters.  At one point there were 52 people in the zone and 50 
corpses at the zone in.  Sound pretty much like 99 all over again, woot!
