Yup 39-49 is 10 long levels.

No this is right

Spell Level/ Warder Level
9/9
15/16
22/22
30/26
39/30
49/39
54/42
56/43
58/45
60/47
62/60
64/60

Spells do not "grow" as you level. The closer a BL gets to his next
spell level the weaker the pet is in relation to the mobs you fight.

Yup, it gets really ugly 36-38 and 45-49. Those are the "hell levels"
for the BL class. You have to group or just tough it out with slow
soloing. There are a few decent solo spots that you can grind through
at, and the payoff is worth it. The 39 pet is really great (especially
with the pet haste spell), and the 49 pet is truly a monster.

The one major problem with the BL class is the fact that they are on
the Hybrid spell progression. As a pet class this makes it extremely
tough in the 30s and 40s. (Mages and Necros get pet upgrades at 34 and
44)
