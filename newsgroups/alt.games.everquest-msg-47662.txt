Druid tracking caps at 125.
When I got my own medallions, I pulled them to the EJ zone, and
usually had both on track when I was standing there. When I handed in
medallions, a friend escorted me to the emperor, and I got the forager
and hunter for a friend of his before we went. I could track both when
we zoned in from EJ, but we pulled to the swamp zone this time, and I
could only track the forager while I was standing there. Running far
enough east let me track the hunter.
