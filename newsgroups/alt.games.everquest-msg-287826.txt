Lol, old school. Finally worked out that as well as boats and PoK books, 
there are now mages doing transports. As I entered Butcherblook, I came 
across a mage offering transport to Nederia's Landing and said yes 
thinking it was the Butcher block port.

It isn't and turned out to be somewhere in Antonica. Still haven't a clue 
where. Eventually found a mage to take me back to BB and found the port.

eassurring the nation that one law still exists for the rich 
and another for the poor. After a personal visit;
