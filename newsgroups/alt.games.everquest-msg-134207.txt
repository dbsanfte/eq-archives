When they found out (about 2 years ago or so) that most druids spent 
more time kiting then grouping they nerfed it. You couldn't be running 
away from a mob (kiting) otherwise dot's only did 2/3 their damage. It 
would do full damage if you were root/rotting (rarely happens) or if you 
were standing still and the mob was moving toward you (again rarely 
happens and you wouldn't get the full dot ticks anyway unless you stood 
and melee'd it when it got to you, hence the rarely happens)
