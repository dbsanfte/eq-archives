Even though I'm with Ben and Moopy on that issue I think it's hard to
explain. You seem to assume you have to achieve something when online.
So not a bit of your time is wasted. So running around to reach your
destination would count as wasted time. In that regard PoK has helped a
great deal, granted!
But there is another point of view. At least for me. When you are forced
to go through zones you had the opportunity to meet other travellers and
hear of things you might not know regarding zones, dungeons or quests or
just get the occasional 'hail'. Maybe you were adventuring with a few
friends so on hearing about a dungeon you might want to check it out. Or
just watching the scenery. This is the part of the game I'm missing
right now. And you can't argue that I could simply avoid PoK books and
run. As I stated above I liked the facts of meeting other travellers.
Running alone through zone after zone without a single player in them is
getting old fast. I did it with my first char that went over lvl30 and
tried to travel all over Kunark. I loved the ruins all over the place
remains  of a once great empire.
To get back on topic...there is much more to this game than reaching
your prefered monster slaughter spot and start grinding. But in my
opinion this is where PoK is to blame. People can and will only go for
efficiency and they are absolutely free to do it with PoK. I really
can't blame them but I sometimes wish I could make PoK undone...
