I don't see that it'll make much difference.  Lots of people
hate waiting 15 minutes for the downlink "auto-port" (even
presuming they're in the Nexus already), or the up to
30 minute wait for the "up-down" trip if they're starting
from a Norrathian wizard spire.

And if they're starting several zones away from the Nexus
or any wizard spire, that's even more incentive to just
buy a "direct flight" from a druid/wizard.
