Don't worry about 1HS. No druid *melees* with their epic :)
Because you are restricted to scimitars, you'll find there are very few 
nice magic weapons you can use in the 1HS department whereas there are 
loads of nice 1HB weapons.

You need a magic weapon if you want to hit magic creatures like ghouls and 
wisps etc. Don't worry only about damage, the ratio of damage to delay is 
much more important. A weapon with 1 dmg would be better than you 5 dmg 
weapon if you hit 6 times as often with it - of course that's just an 
example, you'll never find a weapon with those sorts of stats (well, maybe 
if you're a ranger...)

On a budget of 70pp, you're kinda limited, but you could get velium 
morningstar or warhammer, maybe a screaming mace.

Your role is whatever the group needs. That's the beauty of a druid - you 
can do everything, just not as well as a specialist. If there's no cleric, 
you heal, if there's no mage, you damageshield, if theres no enchanter you 
root-park adds, etc. In any event you should be snaring mobs to avoid 
runners, using harmony to control pulling from camps, and sowing everyone 
(at 14+).

Don't stress over it - put a point in each new skill to kickstart it, then 
the ones you use will go up on their own anyway. Save points for 
kickstarting tradeskills and bumping up skills that fall behind that you 
can't be bothered practicing.

At 11, group up for derv camps in Ro, maybe solo the 2 spawn of alluring 
sirens in OOT (I think they're about your level IIRC - check 
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com). Harmony pull one to break the spawn then you 
should be able to fight them one at a time as they pop - they are very 
wimpy for their level. Also, the bandit sisters camp in LFay - use harmony 
to single pull - as well as xp, you'll get bronze weapons, and necklaces to 
turn in to their father in Kelethin for items.

Maybe leave it a couple of levels, but Lavastorm rocks for druids. Its full 
of summoned mobs like elementals and fire sprites, and you have nice mana-
efficient nukes like ward summoned for these guys.
