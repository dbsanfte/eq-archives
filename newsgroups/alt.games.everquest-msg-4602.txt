I never said my intent wasn't trolling.  I went so far as to point out the
examples.  Where did I contradict myself, dumbass?  I <did> ask about EQ
from day 1.  You're either too blind, too stupid or both to see it.

You're right there.  I do feel sorry for you.  It wasn't fair to have
engaged in a pissing contest with a dickless man.  I especially like how
you've used my 'pity' approach.  Immitation is the most sincere form of
flattery, I guess.

On the other hand, you wouldn't be up for posting references, would you?  Or
are <we> supposed to take your word for it?  I'm able and willing to post
references.  C'mon, hot shot.  You've already been burned once.  Care to go
at it again?
