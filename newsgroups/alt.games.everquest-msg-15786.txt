Velious, Great Divide, Kodiak Cave 3.

I was hunting there at 40 with a 30th level Shaman for heals.
The caves are out of favour, I assume, due to poor loot (occasional kodiak
claws and pelts)
but are awesome exp.
Don't actually go in (unless you can get in a full group) go up to Velks
Lab. on the ledge above, there is a room off to the right which is close to
a the zone in case of trouble. Pull the wanderers and the ones at the front
of the cave, minuses over my group/partnership is you'll not have SoW but
you get better healing and have natural Regen anyway.
