Had a guy give me one of these when I gave him a port yesterday. It has
+5 INT on it, so it replaced my sacrificial dagger which was a loaner
from a guildie. Plus, it has a VERY cool graphic.

No idea where it comes from, though, or what it might be worth in /auc. 
The name would lead me to believe that it had a haste component.
(Useless to a wizzy of course) but nothing mentioned about that in the
stats. Any more info on this item?
