Nope. There has to be some ramping up of the challenge as you reach the 
highest of levels. The rate of levelling and difficulty levels must change 
to reflect the highest levels in the game.

There is naturally going to be a trade-off for people who play at odd 
hours. Are they soloing all the way to 65? If so, do they get to 65 as 
quickly as if they had grouped? Do they have access to the same caliber of 
loot as those who group (raid)?
