This is exactly what happened to (then) mid-level Paladins during
Kunark/Velious.  It is also what will happen (and anecdotally has
already started to happen) to Knights now.  It is only a very small
step from "Knights can't tank in GoD" to "Knights can't tank".  It
is not a question of "if", just "when".

Trials through 4 are tankable by appropriately geared Knights.  The
mountain trial nameds aren't, but one does not require the named be
killed and the other is routinely dealt with via charmed pooka.
Knights are getting into KT just like many others, on the coattails
of their friendly neighborhood Enchanter.  At that point Knights are
beyond the point where they can tank single-group nameds or even
yellow-con trash (barring a good bit of luck with the RNG).

How many groups, _guild_ groups, do you think are taking Knights when
even at 11.2khp and 2600ac they cannot reliably tank the mob that is
the goal of the trial/camp, or even certain of the trash/adds?  When
choosing your answer consider that it takes hours to get to the named
and succeed/fail.

Non-highend Warriors were indeed screwed by the combination of aggro
limited casters and "good enough" Knight tanks who had caster-level
aggro generation.  Now Warriors have caster-level aggro generation,
eliminating their balancing/defining tanking disadvantage (weak aggro
generation), and they have access to AAs worth another 500hp, and an
always on 5% DI damage reduction, and unlinked disciplines that allow
them to chain AETaunt/Furious/Defensive, and Endurance regen AAs, and
those infinitely scaling avoidance and mitigation disciplines.

Knights, meanwhile, are ready for PoP during GoD, just as Warriors
were ready for Luclin during PoP.

Oh yeah, Paladins have one other thing.  They have the gracious
support of the Warriors they supported for many months in their
quest for relief from SOE's inability to understand their own game.
Oh, wait, nevermind that last.
