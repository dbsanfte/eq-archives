I believe you can still get the charm from PoK, it will have no stats on 
it until you start getting flagged for access to various PoP zones, but, 
the adventurers stone can still augment it.  As I vaguely recall, the 
stone increases marginally when you have 10 successes in one theme, but, 
I don't honestly know the details on it, mine has done nothing for my 
charm yet, as I just don't do LDoN all that much.
