The wall is that unhappy place where your obligations in life conflict
with your desire to "be all you can be" in EverQuest.  Nobody likes to
beat their head against a wall and the only solution to avoiding the
wall is to not play EverQuest as much as you&#8217;d/we&#8217;d like
to, perhaps?

The solution I found was to join a computer club and to share my
account
with the club and I share the accounts of the other members of the
club.  It&#8217;s similar to a commune but not quite.  Doing this
allows me to play EverQuest at my convenience and I&#8217;m no longer
stuck trying to level up an avatar to fulfill a specific function for
a specific purpose.

I can for instance log on to the BBS read the EQ message board and
know
what characters are available and play pretty much any class at just
about any level point in the game I want for just about any time
period I want.  It&#8217;s similar to checking out a book from a
library.

We&#8217;ve been lucky or well organized enough to avoid any real
problems.
Since we&#8217;ve been using this system since early in 2000
we&#8217;ve only had to "suspend" one person once over an item "trade"
that wasn&#8217;t sanctioned by the club.

I wonder if any other clubs are doing this?  I know that some guilds
use a system like this but without the face to face accountability I
can see how a system like this one would eventually fail an "online"
community but it does work for a real world club.

How do you get around The Wall?  Does EverQuest give or do your real
life obligations give?  

Or perhaps you feel that neither has to give that&#8217;s fine to,
I&#8217;m just
wondering how you handle The Wall.
