Just a comment or two or three:

PvP is dangerous.  PvP attracts griefers (players who will do things like
killing newbies for kicks, just to cause everyone else "grief").  PvP can
get highly frustrating.  If you get offended when people are mean to you,
don't play PvP.  If you aren't ok with spending a good chunk of your time
hunting PKs (playerkillers) down and looking for revenge, don't play PvP.
But all that considered, I can't imagine ever *not* playing PvP again.  The
reasons are simple:  without PvP about all the rewards of the game are
experience and loot, and sometimes seeing new places.  With PvP it's a
dynamic, fascinating world with all the complexities and twists that life in
a fantasy world like EQ would really have.  To each his own.  But PvP really
ain't all that bad.
