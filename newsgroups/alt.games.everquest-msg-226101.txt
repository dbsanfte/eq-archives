From the shadows, the mysterious "Rastus" <nospam@mailbox.uq.edu.au>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Other than /testbuff that puts you to L25 and gives some no drop
equipment, everything else is exactly the same.

Both. Actually its even harder to level on test due to its prime time
peak population of about 600 or 700 people. And during the day? Yikes.

You should be aware that the quality of player at L25 on test is
extremely poor, far worse than you would find on a production server,
due to the enhanced ability to grief and the total lack of any
recourse when it happens. There's no CS on test.

Once you get to the 40s things turn around though.
