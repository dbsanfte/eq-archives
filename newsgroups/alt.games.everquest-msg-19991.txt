Excuse my 'lameness', but when did we do this? Where did we officially
remove "RP" from EverQuest's description? While someone might have reworded
something somewhere (you tell me -- I've no idea how this rumor started), we
certainly, both internally and externally, still refer to and consider
EverQuest a Role Playing Game. The description of the game on everquest.com
calls it an RPG. The FAQ on everquest.com not only calls it an RPG but even
attempts to define a Role Playing Game in one of its sections. And the small
'old world only' box in the stores says Role Playing Game in yellow across
the top.
