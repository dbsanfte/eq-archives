I'll pass by my normal rule of not answering inconsiderate top posters,
since this is such a funny topic.

Yes, I could to to Casters Realm or to a variety of ezboards, etc. which
are devoted to *being "Legends Forums"* and support it. And yes, I'm
sure I'd see a majority of posters there supporting it. Or, if anybody
bothered to make one, I could find a public forum somebody put up to
talk about how Legends "5uXX0rz" or what have you, and find lots of
people who hate it. However, if you just to to a forum for all EQ
players, such as alakhazams, I think you get a cross section of the
player base. It seems that is' overwhelmingly viewed as a poor idea and
will be bad PR with their customer base. Will this stop Verant from
doing it? Hardly likely, if history is any teacher on such matters.

As to it's success..... will there be 8000 sucker.... errr.... players
who will sign up? I've no doubt. That poll alone tells me that 4% of the
players probably would. Let's see....... 450,000 players times 4% is....
(/em takes off shoes to count) 14,000. Yeah, I think they'll initially
get enough for certainly one, and possibly two servers.

Now, who will they get, and what will the reaction be? Well, I don't
think a bunch of newbies who havent' gotten very far in the game at all
are going to shell out four times the money for these "features" when
they havent' figured out what they have yet. And I think the mid range,
non-uber players are going to know that the *really* sweet, PHAT L3WTZ
in Legends is going to be going to the same people who get it on the
regular servers now, so paying that much to watch other people get even
BETTER shit that you'll never get probably doesn't sound that appealing.

That leaves us with the Uberguilds. Ok. They can profit. And if enough
of them are willing to risk the move, shell out the money, and go for
it, then they will move their guilds lock, stock, and barrel over to
Legends. When they get there, however, they will be faced with the
compeition of nothing but *other* L33t uberguilds. The first race on
that server won't be to see who can get smithing up to 172 and have Fine
Plate. It will be to see who can be the first crew with enough ST keys
to take down the 4th warder.

VI has said there will be dynamic quests going on with special loot, and
that's great. But it's NOT what the Uberguilds have been asking for.
They are tired, on the older servers, of being jammed into the same few
zones fighting over the same top end loot. Racing for the Statue/AoW
after a patch. Hitting the Top Boss Mobs when they pop before
Uber_Guild_02 gets them.  They would like new zones of the caliber of
ToVN and Sleepers (and the couple new ones in Luclin) so they can spread
out, switch off, and have more room to breath. I've seen nothing to
indicate that the copy of Norrath on Legends will have any more or
different zones than we have. So it's the same contests all over again,
only now you've got Fifty Uberguilds to fight against, instead of the
other *maybe* three or four on your old server.

I'm thinking this will fall into the "be careful what you wish for"
category. Of course, with that said, I really do hope the resident
uberguild on our server moves over, and I wish them all the best and
success. ;-)
