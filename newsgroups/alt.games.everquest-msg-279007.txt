Subject: Revisiting FANG
 
Anyone remember the invasion of the FANG people a couple of years ago? A 
bunch of people from the Fight Ace News Group decided to "take over" 
alt.games.everquest. In typical troll fashion, they declared themselves
the 
leaders of EQNG (EverQuest NewsGroup) and made a series of proclamations 
about how the "new" EQNG would be formed and reassuring us that the old 
hangers-on of a.g.e would eventually disappear. 

As you can imagine, it led to some volatile flames that spanned the days
and 
weeks. The trolls were carefully engineered to elicit outraged responses 
and, as human nature has proven to be reliable, people rose to the bait. 
Our trolls battled their trolls in an epic battle. 

In the end, of course, the FANG people eventually went away and things
went 
back to normal. As to what caused it to happen in the first place, I'm 
guessing it was a bunch of bored people taking a swipe at an easy target
- 
after all, EverQuest was several orders of magnitude more popular than 
Fighter Ace. 

Today, for no reason, I decide to track down what had happened to FANG.
The 
original newsgroup is dead because Microsoft no longer owns FA. But FA,
to 
my surprise, is still around and is now up to version 3.6. The
newsgroups 
can now be found at news:gamenews.vr1.com. 

I took a look for our "old friends". Thunder_Princes couldn't be found. 
Neither could the Ardent Avenger. I did find GetSumJ, who just two days
ago 
announced that he was quitting Fighter Ace. 

Don't know what prompted me to look that all up, other than a desire
maybe 
to see what had become of the trolls. Like most trolls I've come across, 
they burned out. Being a troll takes a toll - no pun intended - on your 
psyche, I think, and eventually the troll either burns out and stops
posting 
or becomes completely psychotic. I've seen both happen. 

Anyone else remember the FANG days?

Someone forwarded this to me today...prolly GetsumJ

You'll be glad to know I'm doing just fine. Still have an EQ account but
have mostly been playing City of Heroes. I see a bit of embellishing on
your part, hoping only the worse possible outcome for me. A bit of
wishful thinking. Sorry you felt so abandoned but frankly I just had
more important things to do. Odd how you remember things completely
different from reality.
Thunder Princes and the rest of the gang are all doing well btw. We are
only an "earshot" away.
