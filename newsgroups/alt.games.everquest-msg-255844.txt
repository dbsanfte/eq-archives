Exactly which words did I put in your mouth? I simply responded to your 
cheap shot with one in kind.

LOL. He's an addict? Based on what? The fact that *you* wouldn't spend 
$100/month for a game? For at least 4 people at that. I easily spend 
$300/month eating out with my family. Am I a food addict? Moreover, how 
many new games do you buy a month? I know of plenty of people that spend 
well over $100/month on new games. Spending 100/month on a subscription 
to one game, and not buying new games, would constitute saving money. 
Again, not the behavior of an addict, but someone trying to spend their 
money for entertainment wisely.
