Yeah, just got back from camping it since this morning for a while, guess
i'll get lucky and find her up or after the first cpl hours of killing her
place holder.  Can't wait to get this started past her since I have most of
the groups needed to do the rest.  Started doing the Runed bowl as well.
Thanks
