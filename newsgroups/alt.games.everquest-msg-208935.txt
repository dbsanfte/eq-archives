    The /testbuff command acts as a complete heal on a player. So people try
to use it to kill mobs much, much too powerful for themselves by spamming it
and hoping the mob doesn't kill them in one round. As the piles of corpses
attest, it's ultimately futile. There's also another /testbuff exploit where
one does /testbuff, dies, bags all the free gear, then does /testbuff again.
If your level is actually raised by the command, you get a new set of stuff.
The stuff isn't tagged Lore, even though many of the items that they're
based on are Lore. So you get casters running around with, in effect, two
Steins of Moggok equipped, or rogues with two Crystalline Spider Fangs, or
warriors with two Centi Shortswords, or....
