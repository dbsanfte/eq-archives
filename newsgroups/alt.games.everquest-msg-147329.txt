I Don't think a Guild name can be changed for the simple reason not all
members are online at the time of the change. I have been in guild when they
have disbanded and the players online loss their guild tag but the player
offline retain theirs. The only way to change a name that I can think of is
to form a new guild it will take 10 different members to form the new Guild
then reinvite your old guild members.
