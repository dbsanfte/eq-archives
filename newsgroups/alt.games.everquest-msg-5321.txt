Ummm as far as I knew, you can't use invis anymore to turn in scalps..Save
the scalps up until you're apprehensive, then turn them in.  It takes alot
of orcs and gnolls to get there....
Maybe they mean go invis and go to the guard to target him, run out of aggro
range and take invis off to con them?
We used to be able to use invis to fix faction for a ton of places, like
Neriak with wine and FP deathfist belts, Verant doesn't like people doing
things the easy way anymore I suppose.
