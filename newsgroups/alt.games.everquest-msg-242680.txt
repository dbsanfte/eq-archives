Hm. Pacify was something I forgot. I agree with you there. CC is nearly
pointless when you can do lulls. But me and my group didn't do it that
way. We let our SK Tank pull and let the adds be my concern.

Okay I see your point I think. And I can't argue against it. :)
Lets put it this way. I have the macros ready and if somebody wants them
I can just adapt to that. I never had linked the macros to my actual
casting. And I never will. So I don't spam due to fizzled spells and
pressing this combined macro/spell button again and again.

Good point. But I guess one should go through calling all battle spam
when your toon is young and later settle down to just the needed amount
of messages like slow resist. I'd argue it would help the groups
tremendously when they see what the other members actually do.
Granted on 65 it shouldn't be necessary but sadly I've seen soo much
miserable group play there.

And if they lern to know each other the spam will fade by itself because
then they know when to expect what action from whom.
