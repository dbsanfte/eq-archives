Pretty unimpressive on me at least, but I think I was bugged.  The
first time I tried that looked just like my Kael quest boots, in any
guise.  Later they looked pretty much the same as a fungi tunic,
silver chain with greenish accents.
Speaking of the fungi, I'm not so excited to sell it now.  I have
found that I am a lazy soloing monster now.  I can keep myself at
about 115% haste, regenning 45hp/tick, and Dotting the hell out of the
mobs while meleeing now.  To HELL WITH KITING!  MWAHAHAHAHA
