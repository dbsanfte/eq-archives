> Help!  My trader crashes to desktop at random intervals since the latest
patch!  Havn't seen anything on CR or EQLive - the only reason why I don't
think it's just me is that a) it happens on 3 machines and never used to
happen on any of them, and b) some other people grumbling about it in the
Bazaar.  What's up with this?  It's very annoying, especially when /trader
mode is most convenient when you will NOT be there to reconnect in the event
of a crash to desktop.

I have 2 computers one in Win 98SE and one in Win XP, and 2 accounts (one
for my son). We leave our traders up all night. Since the last patch I will
find the Win XP machine back at the desktop almost every morning, while the
Win 98 machine is still in EQ. If this doesn't change soon I'll be heading
back to Win 98 again. /sigh
