Before I retired my monk I was in a very active guild. We raided 5
nights a week, and everyone was expected to hit 55+ ASAP. As a puller
(and not in the KS group) I lost more EXP than I could make up on the
2 days we didn't raid (I usually spent those two days in the real
world). It's not much fun when the KS group is "dinging" AAXP points
almost nightly when your exp bar is moving backwards hehehe. 

The net loss of EXP and the massive time commitment (for me anyway)
that the guild required forced me to realize that the high-end game is
not my thing. If shared raid experience had existed back when I
retired, there is a slim chance that I might have stuck it out.
