Which food?
1 thing I've noticed im lacking now, is spell haste that my (ring?) used to
give me.

Unfortunately Improved Damage doesn't aid my rains (and when you can cast a
rain for 1890 in 500ish mana, or an 800nuke for 300mana...)

Were none for sale.  Maybe I'll get lucky on a 1-2 group tormy sometime (tho
id much rather random for his head).  I had a dain ring on my shaman that I
can't seem to locate :(  Nfc where that got to...  alternatively, I can give
him a steel ring (of earthern resistance, or something?) - the PoE
tradeskill ring.  I have a few spare.

Oh yeah, and I wonder what fag suggested the lamest looking helm in the
world, to me! :p
I bought a platinum tiara for now, that UGLY coif just HAD to go.  Maybe I
will find a better (stat and graphic) helm at some point.  I bought the
shaman a tiara too, seens as im upto failure number 6 or something on the
PoE chain helm now.

I bought him a lizard too, as I figured horsey is the biggest boost possible
I could get him.
So thats another milestone in the game completed - I've finally zoned into
LoY now too!

Now I just need a AoN, so I don't have to keep turning ugly luclin models
on!
