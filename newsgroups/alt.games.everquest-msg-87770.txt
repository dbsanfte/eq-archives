Hi Pete,

First off let me say hi and welcome you to the eq ng.  I will give you a bit
of background on myself should you care to read:

I started playing UO in 97' played for 2 years and quit.
Started EQ about 2 days after quitting UO -- just making sure family and
friends were still alive :)
Played EQ for about a year and quit, went back to UO - purchased 3rd dawn
Played UO for about 6 months and went back to EQ - purchased SoL (newest
expansion)
Now maintain both my UO and me EQ accounts

So as you can see, at least for me both games have merit and continually
provide a bit of entertainment.  The learning curve in both games is fairly
close, however the interface in EQ will take some serious getting used to
after playing UO... especially where your backpack in UO can contain almost
countless items.

There is generally more emphasis in EQ on character equipment.  A much wider
range of items than we are provided in UO.  Sitting around waiting, and
waiting, and waiting for monsters to spawn is a necessary evil of the game.
That took a long time for me to adjust to as well... don't get me wrong, you
can just wander the countryside looking for things to kill, but eventually
you will want an increased rate of experience rolling in and you will start
to 'camp' at spawn points.  There are trade skills in EQ as well, although
you don't have to spend your day cutting down trees to get your lumber.  In
fact, for the longest time I never even picked up a trade skill... I think I
was lvl 40 or so when I took up baking simply for the fun of it, you can
really do up some wild things :)

I find there is a better range of player types to chose from in EQ, the
graphics are debatably better...  IMHO, something about the 3d isometric
view of spirits in UO really won me over.  Even with the new graphics in EQ
people are still made of triangles and polygons... takes some getting used
to.  The landscape in general is georgeous, I am often in awe of new zones
and giant structures there in.

The world in EQ is *huge* even in all my time of playing, I suspect I've
only explored 50% of zones (keeping in mind I don't have the 2nd
expansion -- Velious or something).

The people in EQ are just as stupid as the people in UO.  There are d00ds,
and assholes, childish behaviour and name calling -- I guess this is the
constant with any online game. You will be able to chat it up at towns,
although like UO some are ghost towns which people never visit..

All and all though EQ is a decent game, and if you enjoyed UO you owe it to
yourself to try EQ for awhile... and I mean a good 2 or 3 weeks of playtime.
I really didn't like it at all for the first week or two, after I was
accustomed to the interface, the playstyle and the commands it suddenly
became very engulfing.

Your system is adequate to play, I am on a celeron 500 w/320mb of ram, cable
connection and it does the trick.  *However*, you may have to drop 100bucks
or so and buy a GeForce 2MX card or something (Depending on your budget).
In addition to 128mb of ram, I splurged and got a generic geforce card...

Cheers!

Probis
