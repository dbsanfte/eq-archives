There stated reason for long respawn times is to restrict the rate at which
new uber items enter the game. Your suggestion is contrary to the stated
goal.

On the other hand if I was running things nothing would have a respawn time
greater than 12 hours.

Gms are so corrupt in favor of smaller guilds its not even funny. If you
want a shot at a mob just petition , chances are you will get it though
everyone will despise you.
