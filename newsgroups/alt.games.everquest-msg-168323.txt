The improvements seem marginal at best, although perhaps they add up.  Sure no
DC or Trueshot/AM on the list that I can see.

Excellent point, I've been using it for just that, too.  And that "first heal"
casts in a second or so, which means you don't have to pump out a SR or SE, and
can do the whole encounter on straight Cheals.  Many PoP mobs (especially the
ones you'd be mobs worried about) seem to take long enough to kill that
arbitration pops back up for the next one.

I was grouped killing giants in the POS desert this morning, and the druid kept
popping a fast heal on me every time I did an arbitration.  I finally asked why,
and she said she was worried I was going to get low HP aggro.  I suppose thats
possible if there's sufficient damage out there... but it would sure have to be
a lot and I'd have to be the one with the least HP remaining, which doesn't seem
likely.  More likely, she's going to get aggro for casting a heal when the MA
doesn't yet have really firm aggro!
