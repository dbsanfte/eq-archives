Other replies you had so far did not answer your question. 
Here are just a few zones where your L19 chanter can solo all day in 
perfect safety (barring any suicide moves on your part obviously):

East Freeport
N Qeynos
G Faydark
Tox.


Of course you won't gain any xp but you can't have everything. Do 
everybody a favor, if you are going to solo, stick to these zones and 
others like them, and try not to take too many mobs away from the low 
level newbies who need them more than you do. 
Don't solo in LOIO and the like, leave that to the druids and necros. 
They solo better than you do and usually there will be too many of them 
competing with you for the mobs.
