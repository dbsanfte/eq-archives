Thanks Tools and Fox for answering.  First, I do not see any kind of zone 
description to give me a clue to where it might be (I wish there was one).

No, I'm not browsing from a black market broker, just from my room.

Thanks for your answers. I guess you're right, if they don't respond to a 
tell to give me directions, I guess I'm SoL and have to go through the 
broker....blah..

Take Care All
