Well, wanking off alone by playing [for example] eye of the beholder 
would save you a lot of money every month without having to treat people 
like human beings.....[actually, i happen to like EOB...fun game even 
though old=)]

If you want to group, you have to deal with people. Most people I know 
say that they are a xx SK and need a healer. that is minimal rp...and 
they at least have the social skills to interact verbally. Once grouped, 
they have to periodically ask things like med break, nature break, can i 
pull now...can i pull faster... we negotiate loot rules and who does 
what job before we go in...demonstrating that they consider me to not be 
an npc put in norrath for their use.

my rp makes me consider NBG looting, unless absolutely everybody 
declines to roll on something and it is a greed roll, whether for an aug 
or a droppable to sell. many others will follow NBG looting in the same 
manner. these people are wonderful to group with. i will group with 
these people again if they demonstrate they can make a reasonable 
attempt at playing their classes, can be depended upon to do their group 
role [puller, mt, main nuke, slower etc] and behave politely. *even* if 
there is a more uber idiot available. i played with one character last 
night that i had to literally tell to sit in a corner and stop hailing 
the trees. i can tell you i wont be grouping with him again.

if you are competent, and treat me like a person, and still make a greed 
roll on something that is a definite upgrade to me, i will sorrowfully 
consider you as someone not interested in the welfare of norrath, and go 
on my way as soon as possible and seek out those who wish to help end 
evil in norrath. IRL, you character is a greedy barstid and i will 
probably not ever group with you again. not a big deal.

if we want to Rp, then fergoshsakes let us RP in peace=)

i would seriously love to have all planar uber loot, and be an epic'd 
65. i can do it if i change my play style to one less RP, but i grew up 
RPing, and it makes me happy.
