While you can hope your raid leader is up to speed, knowing the route 
and details yourself cannot hurt, particularly if you happen to lag out 
or crash to desktop or something.  Keeping your mouth shut about what 
you know unless the raid leader starts asking questions is a good idea 
in general, though, on the "too many cooks spoil the broth" plan

Since you are flagging to get in to the factory, ignore this part.

Mount is a good idea.  In fact a mount is almost always a good idea in 
any outdoor situation, which most POP zones are.  If it is getting in 
the way, get a shrink or two.  Sitting bad, mana regen good = mount.

Ignore this.  Live to the end or get a rez after and you'll get flagged, 
your mission doesn't involve the whole spider teams thing.

Xanamech is a more or less standard dragon fight, again, surviving the 
AoE's and tearing him down fast before your damage forces evaporate is 
the key.

However, before you get to him, you trigger a gnome to take a walk, thru 
hostile forces lining the passages of the zone.  He's fairly fragile and 
quite prepared to fight to the death, you can't let him do that, so you 
need to do a -lot- of killing, keeping his path clear.  Often raids 
detail someone to mez him or to engage him in melee (without hitting him 
back), then mem blur or atone him to get him moving again.  This can 
backfire, however, as he's pretty touchy about his route and can forget 
that he's done it right, go back and start over.  If your force can 
handle it, some raids let him walk at his own pace the whole way to 
avoid this.

Either way, this means the raid force will be fighting half a dozen mobs 
at a time, working furiously on many relatively easy fights, there's apt 
to be little coordination involved.  As a druid, nuke, heal, whatever 
you like... pretty much same as everyone else; do your best to keep 
everyone in your group alive (probably not hard) and kill the mobs fast 
(also not hard, if you've exped at the POI zone line you've met about 
every mob you'll see, this is just lots more of the same.

When you get to the dragon there will be a buff and rest up break 
probably, then you'll engage.  Dragon has two AoE, one of them is 
directional, if you can stay out of his front arc it won't hit you, the 
other you can't really avoid.  MT needs to keep Xanamech's attention so 
most of the raid can stay behind the mob, including nukers and healers. 
  Amusingly, one of his AoE's is a powerful DOT and snare, so once you 
get hit, running behind the dragon if he spins in place is particularly 
difficult.  This aside, the gnome who brought you here must stay alive 
if you want to get flagged, killing the dragon but losing the gnome 
won't do it.  This means that keeping the dragon from breathing on the 
gnome is highly important, all the more reason to keep the dragon facing 
the MT (who is opposite the gnome)

As a general rule in raids, gating and succor are out.  Your survival is 
not important.  Raid success is all that matters.  Expect 96% rez, which 
means you can get the lost exp back in very short time, heck, even the 
paltry exp you get off a raid is usually enough to make up for this.

Gate and succor each take spell slots.  Its hard to imagine you can't 
think of 8 spells you'd like to have memmed (I'd like 10 or 12 slots!). 
  Further, you might accidentally cast one of them when its not 
appropriate, taking yourself or your whole group (or part of your group 
if you are seperated) out of the raid force.  Even when it is 
appropriate, when your raid is clearly losing, its generally considered 
bad form to survive a wipe by running out on your teammates (although, 
situationally it can be beneficial, if it means getting a still buffed 
up and ready to go group out alive and ready to get back to the wiped 
bodies)

In POI in particular, its worse than in many places; there is no COTH 
allowed in the zone, so you can't get back to the raid force without 
killing your way across most of the zone, which is of course stuffed 
with see invis unmezzable unlullable mobs.  And if you live but the raid 
suceeds anyway, you won't be able to get back to the raid in order to 
get your flag.  Dead, they can just rez you.  If the raid wipes, there 
won't be a nasty CR, just wait a few minutes and the bodies will pop up 
in the graveyard.

You'll be eagerly courted for your porting ability after the raid is 
over, without you or wizards, the melee are going to have to fight their 
way all the way back out.  Don't mem gate, succor, or port till you've 
got your flag.
