This is true.  Getting anywhere useful from the TP spot in the DL is
another issue.  Damned near all the mobs in DL see through inviso.
SoW and Levitate are almost required.  My warrior made it through DL
to the spires for a TP up to Luclin, but that was with SoW and being
REALLY careful on the run through DL.
