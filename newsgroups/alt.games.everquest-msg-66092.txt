OK my fellow ATI owners, I have done some digging and some testing
with EQ:SoL and here are the results.

1. Go to Verant's Web site and verify which drivers are reported as
compatible with EQ:SoL
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/compatability_matrix.jsp

Rage Fury Cards:
Win98/ME: http://support.ati.com/drivers/winme/winme_r128_4137192.html
Win2K: http://support.ati.com/drivers/win2k/win2k_r128_513013279.html

Radeon:
Win98/ME:

Win2K:
http://support.ati.com/drivers/win2k/win2k_radeon_513013276.html

Radeon 8500
Win98/ME: http://support.ati.com/drivers/winme/winme_8500_4137206.html
Win2K:

Installation steps:

1. Download and install/re-install DirectX8.1

2. If you are running an AMD Athlon or Duron processor on a VIA
chipset motherboard download and install the latest Via4in1 drivers
(4.35) from:
http://www.viahardware.com/download/index.shtm#4in1
Also download and install the AGP 4.10 driver found lower down on the
same page.

3. Download the correct driver and extract it to a folder (see links
above).

4. Follow the driver Removal and Installation guide found at the
following link. DO NOT skip any steps. This guide will ensure that you
have completely removed the old drivers and registry entries.

The following is for Radeon/Radeon8500 owners ONLY:

1. Download the Radeon Tweaker program (version 1.1.96) located at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/radeontweaker/

The Tweaker requires another helper application GTK 1.3 found at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=27778

Load the GTK1.3, and then install the tweaker.

2. After the Tweaker is installed run it and select all of the
RECOMMENDED settings. The tweaker is easy to use and each setting is
explained.

Using the drivers and installation procedures above I have
successfully run Luclin on the following systems:

System 1
AMD Athlon 900mhz
512mb PC133
Via KT133A Motherboad (Iwill KK266)
Phillips Acoustec Edge Sound Card
Win98SE/Win2K (Dual Boot)
DirectX8.1
Radeon 8500LE (4.13.7206-Win98, 3.01.3286-Win2K)
Via4in1 4.35
Via AGP 4.10
Radeon Tweaker 1.1.96 (all recommended settings)
GTK 1.3

Luclin is playable. I am not seeing any massive lag or pauses in
graphics performance. I set the clipping plain back to about 50%.
There appears to be some pausing when entering a new area as textures
are loaded. It appears as a quick stutter for 1-5 seconds then all is
smooth again. I am running HIGH textures and all character models.
1024x768-Full screen.

System 2
Athlon 900mhz
128mb PC133
Asus P3V4X Motherboard (Via Chipset)
Via KT133A Motherboad (Shuttle AK11)
Built-in Via Sound
WinME
DirectX8.1
Radeon 32DDR/Radeon 7000 (4.13.7189)
Via4in1 4.35
Via AGP 4.10

Luclin is playable. There are MANY pauses for textures to load. All
textures are displayed properly, with no corruption or polygon
tearing. Due to the limited memory in this system I am only loading 2
character models. (additionalmemory is on order)

I am posting this in an effort to help fellow ATI owners. If you have
any additional comments or suggestions please add to this thread.

Cheers
