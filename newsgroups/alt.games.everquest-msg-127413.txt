The only bit I know about it is that part of the field is involved in
separating the random (natural causes and the like) from the planned.
William Dembski was working on the idea of finding "specific complexity"
which could not be accounted for by natural causes.  He was approaching it
from a mathematical view, and looking for patterns and algorithems that
would indicate design as opposed to chance.
