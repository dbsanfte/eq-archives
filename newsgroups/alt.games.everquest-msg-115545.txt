*Mutters something again about her agnostic warrior, who can't use the
bow and can't wear the dark green imbued infused hie armor, and is at
18 somewhat too high to be rerolled. Damn.*

Considering that cultural is a race thing and not a deity thing at
heart, I wish they had put in some non-Tunare wood elf cultural stuff.
And why are all these new fletching things blessed when not a single
one of them is imbued?
