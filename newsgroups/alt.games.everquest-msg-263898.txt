I don't think that means you have to wait to 50 before you get any of them 
... I read "By the time they've reached level 50, every character will gain 
access to four racial traditions " to mean it'll work in a similar way to 
getting skills in EQL.

Like getting dragon punch, flying kick, eagle strike etc. as a monk ... or 
meditate and channeling etc. as a caster. Whatever class you made in EQL you 
had most, if not all, of your skills by the time you were level 30 but you 
didn't have to wait until 30 to get any of them.
