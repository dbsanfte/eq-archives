They did. If you are giving materials to a craftsperson so s/he can make you
something, there is nothing wrong in asking to be grouped while the attempt is
made. If the craftsperson declines to group with you, you should probably find
someone else with the skills you are looking for. Although the Povar-Tarew Artisans
takes pride in the honesty of our members (cheats tend to get kicked out pretty
quickly), I don't expect that any of us would be offended with such a request. *I*
certainly would not be; in fact, I usually insist in such cases :-P

On the other hand, there are some craftspeople who will do a direct swap: "Give me
a HQ cat and 3pp, and I will trade you a quiver I've already made", that sort of a
thing. Of course, you don't need to be grouped for that.
