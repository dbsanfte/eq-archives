I'm not going to say that you will love it, it just isn't for everyone, 
but it is a good newsreader. Things become much simpler <S> once you 
learn the hotkeys. Such as, hitting the "k" key while looking at a 
message will killfile that person, and it lets you set how many days you 
want that person in the filter. Any who, good luck with it.
