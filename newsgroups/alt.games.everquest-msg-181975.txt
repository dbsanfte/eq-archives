    The agreement was made between the three guilds, and the leaders of each
guild agreed to it. So it would be the decision of Lotus Cult and the other
two guilds involved.

    Since they agreed to those terms, THEY made those rules. It's just like
the whole loot thing - who are we to say if they could or couldn't keep the
loot? Well, since they agreed to a deal where they wouldn't keep it, THEY
were. They broke their word to us that this is how things would be. This is
why we're pissed.

    No kidding. It's a good deal for everyone involved. With flagging
working the way it is now, we're seeing more and more 100+ person raids on
my server to get into the second and third (HoH) tier zones so people can
XP.

    It was their suggestion to try and deflect one of our sticking points,
would be my guess. We still wanted loot, specifically the 2HS, off the mob.
So I imagine they said "fine - you can have the loot if we kill it, just let
us kill it in peace". If I were them and negotiating to get a flag mob kill,
that's what I would do.
