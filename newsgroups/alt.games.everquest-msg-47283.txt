Not in this case, becuase the worst case scenario leads people to believe DO
NOTHING, if your hit kiss your bottom goodbye. The reality is that for the
next 10 years it will be limited to back yard inceticide operations unless a
major military state hands over agents. Event hen, outskirt exposure does
have survival chances and *anything* you have helps that.

Modern terrorists are 6-8th grade level education at best, relying on
concealment and bravado.

After reevaluating the events of the 11th, they screwed up hard.

If there were 8-12 total planned, boy did they screw up!

Sure it was bold, unexpected, but the plan as a whole was botched. They
didn't even consider attacks on the gulf and west coast would have to occur
before the eastern USA.
