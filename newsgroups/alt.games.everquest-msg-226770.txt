I got to be ML in two ldon adventures tonight...first time for me.  did 
the  missions (first was a partial, second was success with time to 
spare), sold, and split.  

The question I have is that I thought /split pp gg ss cc was supposed to 
split EVENLY across all members of the group.  When I did the first 
split, it should have come out to be 42p 5g each, but I ended up with 
44p...why?

(And, since I messed up and split with one of our 5-person group out of 
zone, gave her the 44 plat so she wouldn't be out anything...I wasn't 
there for the loot so much as xp.  Did I do the right thing there?)

So, is there a bug, or did I just not quite understand the /split 
command?
