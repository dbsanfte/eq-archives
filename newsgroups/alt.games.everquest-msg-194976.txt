I played two clerics, and discovered Flash at about 30 on the first one,
my second used it extensively from 1 to about 55 and occaisionally
afterwards (flash kitng undead in PON is fun)

I made a point of grabbing a copy for my shaman, but haven't used it yet,
been tanking or acting as standard group shaman/tank while I can (pretty
much any class can tank for the first 20 levels, and I think should, get
those defense skillups in there while they are relatively painless!)

Flash's extremely short cast time and the fact that it's rarely resisted
make it an ideal soloing tool, I look forward to figuring out the details
on a shaman, your notes here should help.  Using a pet in tandem with it
hadn't occured to me, it runs around if its target isn't in melee range,
rather than latching on to whoever -is- in melee range?  Does this also
work for PCs if they can keep low on the aggro list (say evading rogues?)

I can see I'm going to regret not making an Innoruuk shaman for the snare
neck, I thought that wouldn't be too important lacking Fear, but with
Flashdancing and DOTs breaking Root, snare would have been nice.

Forssake, still 13 cause of the login weirdness and now the patch!
