    Agreed. I'll give two examples, different enough that they can't be
called different forms of the same thing, but they do boil down to "knowing
what to do" because everything is knowing what to do.

(1) Figuring out a new encounter. My specific example is the Rallos Zek
encounter. Until that fight, we had never used the bard gate song (sorry,
this involves a bard) for anything. But we used it to get rid of adds in
that fight. We also used an AoE x-loc out of the zone to let other adds
despawn, rather than try and fight them, kite them, etc. These are things
we'd never done before in any encounter. So was it skill in knowing all the
things we were capable of doing and picking the ones that helped us overcome
the fight, or was it just "knowing what to do"?

(2) My buddy that got me into EQ used to play with an enchanter, Eros. When
Sebilis was just being explored after Kunark came out, they would go there
as part of their normal play group. When they went, Eros would be group
puller, lining up all the mobs neatly mezzed for the group to kill. One of
the tricks he'd do when they set up in a spot like Nec Guard was this: he'd
jump the gorge to make the mob path a little bit longer to get to him and
give himself time to mez it. Now, I've seen that gorge and I sure as hell
wouldn't jump it every time I pulled, knowing a mistake would likely kill
you and leave your corpse in the water at the bottom (Sebilis was NOT
trivial back then). So was his ability to time the jump a skill, or just a
matter of knowing when to hit the space bar?
