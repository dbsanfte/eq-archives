I really think you had a string of bad luck.  About a week ago I
solo'd 5 Hill Giants using my charm/swarm kiting technique (Level 42
bard) and only one of them dropped 4pp.  The rest dropped on average
35pp.  The richest giant I killed dropped 49pp.  Ok, it actually
dropped 47 pp but between the extra gold and silver it equaled to 2
more pp.  In around 20 minutes worth of work I earned about 130pp with
those 5 Hill Giants.  The xp was really crappy but I guess that's the
tradeoff.
