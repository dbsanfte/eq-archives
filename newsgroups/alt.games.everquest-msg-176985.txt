I just read about this today, and must be why I thought there was something
special about them. Very likely they will win 3 years in a row, 2003, 2004,
2005(might be a major riot on this one if Clinton is elected, hopefully
played in Bay Area against 49ers at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, would
make a good story to tell grandkids at least as long as not many people are
hurt)

I would probably go to that game even. What is the spread on tommorow's
game, 4 points or something?

Tampa Bay Florida - Freaky winter storm
Bay area - No rain for 2 weeks, otherwise decent weather, green hills and
foliage in January

Bucs have to travel west, jet lag
Raiders can just drive south

No brainer, the hardest thing for me is figuring out how to place a bet
