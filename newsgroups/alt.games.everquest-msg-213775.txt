Yes, for the same reasons I would get to know anyone I meet through any 
other means.

No.  I've met a few people who play, and I do talk to them at times, but 
none have become close friends.

No.  See above.

No, but could happen.  I actually met my wife through AOL, long before 
EQ.  She lived across the country from me, we met a few times, and, 
eventually, I moved out to her, and married her.  Still married to her to 
this day.
