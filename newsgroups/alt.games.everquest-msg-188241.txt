Ew. it was $5.95 when I looked as well.  I was still considering buying
into it, maybe after my EQ subscription lapses...  But I certainly don't
think it's a $9 a month game either.  At $5.95 it's a cool little
distraction game, at $9 a month it's getting into the real game prices,
which it just doesn't compare to.

Well it's not that bad, I refuse to even use a messenger service, except
at work where they make me...  But yeah if you are that irritated by
people you don't really know it wouldn't be for you.
