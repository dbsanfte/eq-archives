Yes, but as I said below, no other class can do ALL of it in one
cuddly little half elf package.  Druids are a GREAT addition to any
exp grind group.

>Druids are decent at soloing but suck ass on raids.

FWIW, my main is a druid.  52.  Not in an uber guild, but we do ok.
That said....

Yeah, druids are excellent soloers, but yeah they aren't necessary on
raids.  Then again, the vast majority of classes aren't NECESSARY on
the majority of raids.  You don't NEED a mage or a necro.  Don't need
a ranger.  More than three enchanters are over-kill for most raids.
Don't need bards.  If you got a warrior (at least 55, with defensive)
and a paladin, you don't need a shadowknight.  If that wizard doesn't
have mana-burn, what's the point.

>Wizards out nuke me, 

Because that's pretty much ALL they can do, other than play taxi.  And
druid nukes are only second to wizards. 

>strength buff is useless and over written by Shaman
>buffs anyway, 

But since they're going to be spending their time buffing and slowing,
somebody has to play back up healer, particularly if you're short
clerics.

>Clerics over-write my skin buff, 

But if you're like most normal guilds I've seen, you're a little short
on clerics more often than not.  So, having a druid around can be nice
to help out.

>CH is a broken spell
>that makes all other heals pale in comparison. 

If all you're doing is back up healing, say keeping the any casters
alive that stray to close to the fight, you don't NEED CH.

>DoTs are for soloing, uber-mobs resist them and regular grinded mobs
>are dead befor the dot is even half over makiing it extremely
>inefficient mana wise. 

Yeah, but unlike a BUNCH of classes druids do indeed have the option
of soloing.  And soloing damned well.  One of the big things that
makes druids such good soloers is our diversity in spell casting.  For
that diversity we trade off having a specialty.  It's a tit for tat
thing.  

>Damage shields are
>nice in grinding but minor on raids, regen is also nice grinding but also minor
>on raids. 

Yeah, but then again for most people, the vast majority of the game is
grinding.  And druids are pretty damned great for grind groups.

>The debuffs are a joke, resisted a lot and draw way too much agro
>in some cases.

Won't argue the aggro thing, but I actually find my fire debuff handy
for soloing.  At 52, my new fire DoT gets resisted more than I'd like,
so my pull spell is almost always my debuff.  Very handy at that.

Sorry, but I can't help but think that you're missing out.  *Shrugs*
