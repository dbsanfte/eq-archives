Same Resolution On is what I use...the windowed screen is much smaller than

There are 3 easy ways I know of:

Create a "Spells" hotbutton (you can make the book icon a hotbutton like
you'd make anything else a hotbutton)
Type /book
Hit Ctrl-B

I got it to work the other day but I forget how...I THINK I right-clicked on
the top left little square in the chat box.  Normally I just change to
windowed view and do it from there.  It's annoying.
