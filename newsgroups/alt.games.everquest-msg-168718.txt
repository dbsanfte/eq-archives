The problem is that you have a really fuzzy notion of what the "fruit of 
your labors" is. If you are making a great salary at a company that only 
exists because of corporate welfare provided by the local State 
government with taxes that came out of my pocket, damn right I want a 
piece of that. If you drive to work on roads paid for by my taxes, I 
want a piece of that. If the company you work for makes money out of a 
country open for business by US forces, whose budget comes out of my 
taxes, I want a piece of that too.

And of course, it goes without saying, the money *I* make also partly 
belongs to you, for the same reasons. What you naively refer to as "your 
labor" is actually the labor of everybody in the country. You are just 
failing to see the connections.

Good! We'll make a leftwinger out of you yet. :P

Care to explain, or at least provide a valid example?
