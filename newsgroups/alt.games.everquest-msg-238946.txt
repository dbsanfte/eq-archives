DOH! And here I thought I had created the perfect lowbie soloing machine,
the auto-self-healing tank (a low-level paladin wielding a lvl55 2-hander
that procs a 180-point heal). Of course the proc is still there but if the
weapon's damage is scaled appropriate to the toon's level, we're talking
single-digit DPS now. Well can't really call it nerfage can we...;-)

Hmm, perhaps I'll try an experiment: just how long might a melee fight last
if the toon's weapon proc heals him mana-free faster than a db mob can
inflict damage, but the weapon's DPS is so low that he can't hardly put a
dent in the mob? That'll be my frog pally parked in a corner of CB for the
next day slugging it out with an orc legionnaire....
