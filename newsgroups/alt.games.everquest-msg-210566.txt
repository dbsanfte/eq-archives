Not only useful downright required for being in a raiding guild.
Whole guilds benefit from it. The reduction in downtime is huge.

> Bard- May add the most to a players usefulness

Yes a very useful Epic, it benefits many people not just the Bard.

> Beyond that no dice

Most epics have decent stats even if the effect sucks.
Remember Epics were Kunark era items.

Rogue Epic is nice for the haste. Very easy to get.

Beastlord Epic also has haste, very useful.

Monk epic is still very useful. Its easy to get compared to some Epics.

Mage Epic is useless, the 61 pet beats the epic Pet. Just Level.
This epic is waaay too dificult to get for the item.

Druid Epic is Decent.

Paladin and SK epics are a joke.

Necro Epic is sad.

Warrior Epic is decent for warriors in a small guild.

Shaman epic is out dated.

Enchanter epic is out dated.

Wizard Epic is nice but not essential.

Ranger epic is still good for people not in an uber guild.
