I wonder how many of you haven't bothered to update all your drivers in 
years. I'm having no trouble with lockups at all.

Please tell me you're either joking or have zero experience in this area, 
not to mention having no clue when this not-quite-CH is availible to 
Druids (58).

Someone that wants something vaguely resembling mana efficiency, and 
anyone that wants to make actual use of a druid so we don't get bored and 
say "screw this"? I've far better things to do than act as a main healer 
in a dungeon full of newbies when clerics are availible.

Where did we take over as Wizards? I don't recall seeing that memo, it 
must have been slipped into the pile of other flames I get simply because 
I'm a Druid.

May I suggest two things:
#1: Don't start blasting right at the beginning of the fight like an 
idiot.
#2: Use that "useless" cleric to stun the target and blast away like an 
idiot anyway.

It's fun when you know what you're doing, isn't it?

If you're getting smacked a lot, there's something wrong with either your 
tactics or your group.

Where the hell did we steal wizards jobs? Do you have any clue what you're 
babbling about? Apparently not...

Good, it'll increase the average IQ of Everquest players to lose people 
like that from the population.

While there are druids out there that apparently WANT to steal the jobs of 
Wizards and Clerics, those of us that know what the hell we're doing do 
NOT want those jobs. We want to remain druids; it's a far more 
entertaining job. I couldn't really care less about getting TR. The 
people I run with know better than to throw a Druid into a Cleric's 
shoes, and we don't have a huge shortage of Clerics. TR will be useful to 
me only in dire emergencies and, depending on situation, raids. Druids 
have not and will never replace a good Cleric (though we've been able to 
replace a bad one for years).
