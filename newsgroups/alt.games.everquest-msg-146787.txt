Hmm, that one isn't on my list.  Perhaps because I don't understand
the position.

If this is the point then my response is

I'm willing to make small risks which don't endanger life and
limb or more importantly my RL family, in order to perhaps
get equally small and unimportant in the grand scheme of things
rewards.

In this bounded game environment, I can risk anything, even
death, in order to win some small trinket or just the thrill
of vicariously defeating some difficult opponent.

While in RL I might be reluctant to argue with a cop who's
pulled me over for something I didn't do, since facing down
an armed man with the de facto presumption of righteousness
on his side isn't a good bet, in a Game environment I'm free
to take such gambles willy nilly, sometimes I "die" and
sometimes I persevere against incredible odds... all in  good
fun either way.
