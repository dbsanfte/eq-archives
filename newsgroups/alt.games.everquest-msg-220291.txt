Great idea... for another game. EQ explicitly requires you to camp 
specific spawns to obtain specific items and for quests.

This anti-camp nerf would *have* to be balanced by a serious quest/drop 
system overhaul... otherwise players will be screaming.

"First I have to camp mob X through a dozen PHs, THEN when the named 
pops, it *might* have what I need...and this is already friggen lame... 
and now you've gone an nerfed it so the whole time I'm not even being 
awarded xp? Why call it EverQuest if every aspect of the quest system is 
devised to ensure nobody would enjoy doing one? Might as well call it 
EverTradeSkills" ;p
