Grats me.  You skill in fubar posting has increased <255>.  Anyway, what I 
meant to say was that Verant is stating that the 'total EXP required to 
get from 30 to 60 has not changed' they haven't said that 'the total kills 
to get from 30 to 60 has not changed'.  It certainly required fewer kills 
(for EVERYBODY except clerics, warriors, rogues, druids, and shaman who 
have NEVER grouped with a hybrid) after they fixed hybrid exp penalties.  
Your numbers are good, and the multiplier idea is one that should have 
been obvious to me from the beginning, but we have no real proof that they 
will introduce multipliers less than 1.0 on any level.
