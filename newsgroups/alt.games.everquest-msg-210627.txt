Economics dictates that the price for labour should settle at the least 
amount the employer can pay without the employee deciding its not worth 
showing up for work/finding a new job/etc.

That hasn't occurred. Newbies would happily keep their chips and silks 
for 1 or 2 pp per stack (that's still be 500-1000% markup over what the 
merchants pay AND very good money all things considered at the low-low 
levels after all).  Just because 'daddy makes a million bucks an hour' 
and the time it would take *him* to clean the garage would pay for 10 
ferraris doesn't make the job worth even one ferrari to me. 'I'd do it 
for a fiver...'

There are only two exucses for 10,000% markup...

One is charity. And I'm sure this is a factor... many many people are 
happy to give away items or grossly overpay a newbie for something.

The other is supply & demand. And this may be the case too. Is the 
newbie population sufficient to keep the high-levs adequately supplied 
with bonechips? Perhaps not... perhaps the price of bonechips has 
escalated because only at 20pp perstack is it enough to divert cash 
starved 10th, 15th and 20th level players back into chip/silk hunting 
because its the best way for them to earn money too... while at less 
than 20pp per  stack maybe they're better off farming bronze/rawhide/etc...

Its certainly possible: the server population *is* top heavy.

However, whether its charity or supply/demand it doesn't strictly 
matter. At the end of the day its still twinking from a certain point of 
view.

Consider that twinking is simply acquiring equipment that you could not 
hope to acquire at your level, without the "patronage" of high level 
players. That 2nd clause adds an impor

Its only marginally more abstract, but its not difficult to see that the 
ability to "earn" items selling bonechips for 20pp, one way or another, 
requires patronage of high level players.

Players 'your level' could not hope to afford such prices. The 'economy' 
mixxes production from all levels of player into a big melting pot, so 
its impossible to engage in an economy excluding higher level players. 
But seeing as the higher level players have impacted the economy so 
dramatically it is not unfair to suggest that engaging in the player 
economy (either buying or selling into it) ultimately amounts to a 
significant amount of effective patronage. And that is why a large 
number of RP/Ironman/do-it-yourself players boycott the bazaar and the 
more 'perverted' aspects of the economy.
