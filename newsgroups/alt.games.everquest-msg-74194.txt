me and my girlfriend have been playing eq for a little over a year now and
have never had a problem getting to Firiona Vie from butcher block.
Till last night.when we get on the shuttle from bb to zone into timerous
deep it says loading.....then it pops up chat like the zone has loaded. then
rite away zones back to BB as if we arent loading fast enough. We have on
the memory cache to help load zones faster and it has been working with
other zones but not this problem. and kunark is enabled cause we can port to
dread lands just get lost.
me and her both would be gratefull for any ideas or help.   Thank You
