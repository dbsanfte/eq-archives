Strange thing happened in EC today. Was grouped at orc 1 (again) with a
halfling and another dark elf. The group was crap, when i arrived i said im
almost oom let me med before you pull, guy pulls the whole camp immediatley and
i use remaining mana and start to melle, halfway through the fight when hes
nearing death he quips "Arent you going to cast some spells?" he dies, i
survive. I go back we start again. Anyway, he agrees with the other guy to buy
DF belts so the guy leaves to go get them while we are supposed to be fighting,
i think "Do the fucking trading after" but say nothing. We cant really fight
with just the two of us and besides the other guy seems more occupied with
randomly running around attacking the odd lion. A guy comes up and starts
pulling orcs, i think "bloody clown, we have this camp" but as were still
waiting on the other guy to return i just sit on it. A high level barbarian
chick turns up and wipes the whole camp out. I say "These people are taking our
camp" to my groupmate but hes busy slaying big cats. Anyway, after a while the
barbarian comes up to me and says "Are you just going to let me steal your camp
like that?". "well our group is disorganised right now, but yea, who the fuck
do you think you are?" i reply. She says "Nice to see somebody with some balls"
gives me 50 plat and buffs me to the nines. That is a fortune for me and im
well chuffed i can now afford my level 12 spells. At the same time there was a
guy casting an illusion that makes him look like a tree and offering loot to
the first person who could find and poke hm. I love EC sometimes heh.
........After reading that back i realise that i post here sometimes just about
my experiences in EQ , sorry about that but none of my friends family or mates
play EQ, hope you lot dont mind my pointless tales.
