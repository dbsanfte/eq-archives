I'm of two minds on the subject.

First, as I have a wiz as an alt, I know what you're saying re: mana.

On the other hand, I play on a machine that has a P4 1.4 processor and a
Geforce2 with 64Mb onboard ... and when someone zips past me with some type
of conjured compadre in tow the framerate dies.  Or when I try to buy from a
vendor who's around a wiz with a familiar (as I did yesterday), the
framerate was so bad that I could only complete the transaction by staring
at the ground and clicking on her shoes to open the vendor window.  If it
hadn't been for the fact that she was selling the Tribal Mask for 30p, I'd
have probably gone to another vendor for it.

Whenever I go to meetings, we have to either silence or turn off pagers.
The more I think about it, I'm starting to think something similar needs to
go for the Bazaar. No pets ... no familiars ... no warders.  They poof at
the zone, and as long as you're there the spells have a funny way of not
working when you try to throw them.

My 2cp, fwiw.
