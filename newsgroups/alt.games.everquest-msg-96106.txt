Probably no *great* reasons, but: A) it's only mana
efficient if it's being cast on more than 3 people at a

that are constantly running up to them and saying, "sow plz
thx bye."

Isn't it generally conceded to have the best combination of
hitpoints and melee damage output?

Good question. Maybe it takes just enough damage often
enough that you have to heal/buff it to keep it alive?
