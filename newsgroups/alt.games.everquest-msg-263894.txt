I've been reading alot about EQ2 and all the pros and cons to system 
requirements.  In another thread, there was a quote that Sony has set the 
graphics standard with future development of technology in mind, or, they 
have developed a game with graphics that current computers can't handle, but 
in the future, hardware will catch up to the software.  Don't they remember 
what a gigantic disaster Shadows of Luclin was when it came out?  To play 
that expansion, you had to upgrade to DX8 and if you didn't have a video 
card that supported DX8, well, too bad for you.  What's to say that when the 
next generation video cards do come out, and the game becomes playable, Sony 
won't just up the requirements again?
