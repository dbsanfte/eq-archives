25 mana?  At level 50 (about minimum level you'd come across a black
sapphire) that's a loss of mana just to gain 1/3 (minimum) of one swipe of a
critter's paw in HP?

Considering the cost (and considering at level 51 and 52 I'm perpetually
broke with a current combined bank account of only about 5k) I'm thinking
it's probably not worth it.

I don't have my tradeskill book handy and I can never find the right
castersrealm's page in the time it would take me to add this line, but you
said electrum earrings...if gold adds AC and maybe switches the HP/mana
thing, THAT would be worth it.  Do you know the stats of the gold earrings
by any chance?
