Yes, I said as much.  Druids and mages tried this in groups I was in 
again and again, and it just didn't work out, the stars pretty much had 
to all align and even then your group had to be arranged around the plan 
or it didn't work right.  But arrange around the banishment plan and 
then don't have multiple rock spawns or get any resists at all and you 
aren't playing optimally... I don't know about now, but back when we 
were failing 100 times in a row, optimally was the only way anyone ever 
got thru a trial.

This is the waltzing around plan I'm referring to; it can work, it does 
work, and it means more damage from every pet (and every melee except 
the MT, too)... but for some reason, MT's just don't seem to grasp this.

Which is unfortunate, I know I've seen this reported many times, you are 
looking at 15% more DPS on average from each melee/pet who is in the 
rear arc, not to mention no riposte damage, no enrage damage.

I did this while soloing my shaman, shaman would tank and pet would DPS; 
even got to where the shaman wouldnt' actually bother meleeing, just 
stood close to take the damage (better at it than pet) and increase 
pet's DPS (definately noticable when pet is the only thing doing 
damage).  Its not hard, its effective... so why aren't more tanks doing it?

I mean, in your average group, 50% of the damage is coming off 
melee/pets other than the MT (figure MT plus nuking is the other 50% 
more or less), so the MT can improve group damage by 7.5% just by 
bothering to learn to dance!

That doesn't count mage water pets (and some necro pets), though, which 
do even -more- damage from behind, just as rogues do, but are much less 
manueverable than rogues.

If you gave the plate classes a discipline which increased group damage 
7%, didn't cost any endurance or have a timer or interfere with any 
other discipline uses, wouldn't they be lined up around the block in POK 
to get the book?

I especially notice that with earth pets, which of course have prox 
aggro creation, but this explains why water pet with taunt off still 
isn't able to dump aggro to a shaman pet with taunt on who engages first 
with any reliability.

Making Malosini a key spell, I've noticed.  While -I- might not have 
trouble landing nukes, making my air pet's stuns land is a bigger deal. 
  20% slow that stacks with shaman/enchanter slow?  Sweet!  Now if only 
they'd up the drop rate on gnoll hide lariats.  (j/k, of course, the 
mobs we are killing will be immune to that stun anyway)

Really?  Thats a pity.  I don't know what you are referring to, though, 
in terms of pet upgrades.

Going from previous MS pets, I assumed MS III was essentially a GV pet 
that doesn't cast and has GV earth pet HP, plus -sometimes- GV fire pet 
DS (which the GV fire pet rarely casts!), which would make him a nice 
tool for soloing low level mobs (velks spiders for example) or when 
partnered with a Chealer.

I mean, I -miss- having a self DS-ing pet, but 50+ fire pets are a joke 
and the Decoy can't hit the barn side of a broad.

I figure you compare all nukes to all nukes, details like whether fire 
based or not, evoc or conjuration based are just part of the comparison. 
  Question is, at the end of the day, how much damage does it do per 
mana spent?

But lets look.  Char, 700 damage for 260 mana, evoc based.  With same 
assumptions as I made for SFoS, thats 3.04 damage per mana.  Since SOS 
and SFoS are significantly better damage ratio I really haven't used 
Char in ages, in fact I didn't use it much at level 52, when it seemed 
to compare poorly to the conjuration based nuke I was using back then, 
due to an erroneous assumption I was making about summoned jewelry...in 
reality I was only getting 2.9333 damage per mana of shock of swords.

I just realized I have forgotten to include the earring summon in any of 
  these estimates, but since in all cases they would effect the numbers 
in the same ratio, the  comparisons should all still be valid; the 
reported mana efficiency are all too low, but too low to the same 
proportion.

Well then, tell me about ASOTS, rumor has it that ancient spells no 
longer drop on most servers and are essentially unobtanium, and further 
that they always were unobtainable by normal players, only top end 
guilds ever saw copies of any of them at all.

I'm looking at Firebolt of Tallon, 2000 damage for 500 mana, 4.0 ratio 
without considering focus items or specialization, looks like a sharp 
upgrade from SOFB (fire based, but Bolt, on the other hand, level 61, EP 
deal)

Looking at Black Steel, 1400 damage for 360 mana, conjuration but not 
fire based; 3.89 ratio without focus items or specialization.

I guess in both instances ASotS would be better... but since I don't see 
any chance of getting it, thats just something to irritate me.
