That is a great story!

Very sneaky and very well planned out attack.

What you did was underhanded and you totally ruined a planned event
with a GM presiding. You were lucky that you didn't get suspended or
have a warning put on your account. 

I don't think what you did was wrong, but it smacks a little bit of an
exploit. Using multiple characters to spy on and even lower the
defenses of the enemy guild violates the spirit of a Guild War.

Enjoy your success, and be thankful that the only punishment you
received was the ending of the Guild War.


Cheers
