I've been trying to log in tonight for about 3 hours now. Every time I can't
connect to the login server and the few times I do get through (via heavy
enter-smashing) it says the login server is congested..

Is the login server down? Nothing is noted on the server status pages, but
it's seriously ruining my plans considering I was going to update the
guildbankers, re-arrange them and magelo-update them.

After 30 minutes UT usually starts to bore me :-/
