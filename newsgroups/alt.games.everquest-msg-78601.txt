Str, it has a direct affect on your attack rating that you can see...
to a point. Is it worth wearing an item with zero or perhaps bad ac
then for str? No, its not. For the most part just getting weapon skill
and offensive skill up is what is going to make you hit better and
that happens naturally by level.

Basically as a 32 pally, the 3 main possibly benefits of AC/HP and
higher str (small as that benefit may be) will be realized for you in
the best way by buying a full suit of crustacean plate. This stuff is
just DARN GOOD and basically the holy grail of tanking (ac/hp/str)
until basically you are getting planes armor. I tossed it on my troll
sk at like level 9 and its still very good for it at level 36. You can
get a lot of milage out of it without worrying about a higher AC item
for say the chest like the enameled black bp, by instead maximizing
your accessory item acs such as cougar claw earrings for the ears and
at least fine steel plate (player made, and cheap) or better ac for
the face and gorget. Of course for the rings you'd get player made 6
ac 65 hp ones or barring that the 5 ac 55 hp ones which are a lot
cheaper (even the 4 ac 45 hp VERY cheap ones are better than rings
such as ones with just 5 ac and 5 str.)

Best place to buy crustacean really might be in cobolt scar, but
unfortunately it will be hard for you to get there since you are
probably kos = / Right there is where people quadding the othmir will
be selling it cheap since they are druids or wizards who won't feel
like going to ec to try to sell it when they get it and its heavy and
lore. Heck I've even seen crustacean arms on vendors which i guess
players sold when no one would buy, at fairly affordable prices.
