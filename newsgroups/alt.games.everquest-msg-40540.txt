    And you think a group of FRIENDS will be able to waltz into a TCC
dungeon with a valuable drop and take that camp? Again, I use pre-Kunark as
my guide: every item of value is camped by a full group, each group has a
"list" of folks next in line to join the camp. Unless you're list holder and
can manipulate who gets in, you have no choice who you group with other than
avoiding the camp. And not many strangers run NBG these days, as not many
camps drop items for every class which are of equal market value.

    And less time doesn't wash. If all of your "friends" can solo the mobs
in question as they get to higher level, then each of you can solo camp X
*at the same time* and get all six items in Y time, where Y is how long it
takes the last drop of the six to drop. If you have to move around as a
unit, you have to spend the time it takes each item to drop as a sum to get
the six drops. You'd better be getting XP if you're using up that much game
time to accomplish something. And you ARE making sure every one of your
friends gets rewarded for helping you by getting six items total, aren't
you?

    And it isn't longer longer longer if you do the right thing and make
sure everyone gets something?

    The evil farmers MUST get something out of it if they do it. If farmers
hated farming and felt that being in a full group was a better path, why
wouldn't they do it? Unless there's already too few things they could do
that are level-appropriate.

    And better that THEY sit there and do nothing than ME.
