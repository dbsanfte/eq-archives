Taking up the cause of an argument that can be demonstrated to be
wrong is one thing. Moving the goalposts and throwing up the smoke and
mirrors once that demonstration has taken place in order to bring some
false legitimacy back to a defeated stance is quite another.

Others DID say more words on it. You then proceeded to try to bog
things down with, in the words of another here, semantic bullshit. It
was only after you were called on it that you suddenly got defensive.
Well, if you don't like getting called on it, DON'T DO IT.

And enough with the "get over yourself" histrionics. It's meaningless
in this context.

I can't imagine why someone would get upset when someone starts
spouting off theories about how its okay to wreck a game and then
starts flinging up (again) semantic bullshit to obscure the debate
when the stance falls apart around them.

You called yourself a "devil's advocate". Understand exactly what that
means - you're defending an argument that can and has been shown to be
wrong and yet are trying to legitimize it through any means possible
anyways. Your appraisal of your position therefore is quite accurate -
you are trying to defend a reprehensible stance. You are using
disingenuous debating tactics to do so under the cover of
"intellectual discourse", and by doing so you appear to give them more
legitimacy than they deserve simply because the bullshit is piled so
high.

Then when someone took the time to dig through it and blow the feeble
mewlings of your argument to smithereens, calling you out for shifting
the goalposts, you retreated into more semantics, crying about how you
were being treated etc. Well it was refreshing to see you drop the
broken threads of your pro-ebay argument but I can't say your
replacement is much better.

You picked a sorry topic to do so, used arguments that were shown to
be false, and engaged in questionable practices after they were
knocked down. Hopefully you've learned a lesson about being a "devil's
advocate".


>Nevermind. You win. King Ben rules usenet, blah, blah. Happy?

I hate slimey defense lawyers.
