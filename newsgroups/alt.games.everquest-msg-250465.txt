I know that all of the poeple I know in game are not buying it .. you
can count yourself in the minority from my perspective.

Look at the context the bl;eat was about high end raids in GoD .. the
ubers were complaining taht they had setup for 70+ raids in time and
has to go down in numbers for GoD.  That help a bit in the context?

No just everyone I know.

Ah the failed raiding expansion .. seems to be a thread here.

Yes .. I am one who was bitterly disappointed by this summit.  I don't
know why I thought they may have got it right but as soon as the list
of immediate fixes came out my worst fears were justified.  I have
stated before that SOE had a golden opportunity to set things right and
they missed it.  All they had to do was go to their own forums and pick
something for everyone that could have been fixed or did not unbalance
the game. They didn't do it .. a little bit of a bone thrown to the
majority of the players would have solved all the negativity.  Instead
they catered to their audience of uber guilds and fan sites ... sigh.

Yes my 65 Shammy still can't get a slow in on time and parties are
still dying needlessly.  Was in there tonight actually .. some of the
transits are easier and they have fixed some pathing issues but it is
still not right.

Congratulations ... obviously you love SOE ... I bought GoD and made a
berserker (2 mistakes in one expansion) ... I won't be buying any more
after last weekend's debacle (the gab-fest).
