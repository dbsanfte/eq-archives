Correct, if an individual (say, a wizard) who was ungrouped did more damage
than any individual in a six person group, the wizard would get the xp, even
if the sum of the damage done by the group was greater.  Stupid system, but
that's how it was on day one.  I can't remember when they changed it...
pre-Kunark?

They're wrong :)  It was a long standing rumor (making it quite on-topic for
this thread), but it was never the way it worked.  One variant of this was
the rumor that said if your *pet* got the killshot, it stole 50% of your xp.
That, as far as I know, has never been correct either (though I've never
played a pet class, and have always been fuzzy on the xp rules with pets).
