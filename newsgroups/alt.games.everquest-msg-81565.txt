Hmm. My non-expert opinion is that this sounds like power supply problems
with the card. Why this should suddenly start happening I don't know. Might
be worth popping open the case and making sure the card's power supply
connection is ok. (voodoo5 has to have a direct link to the power via one of
those red-black-black-yellow cables, rather than getting power through the
agp port like GeForce does).

One of my machines is a very similar setup - P2 400, 512 ram, voodoo5 agp,
and aside from running like treacle it has no problem :)
