    Nice misrepresentation.

    Our server is a lot better for this. Most guilds will let another guild
that gets there "first" throw themselves at the mob until they quit, and
then move in. The only dispute comes in deciding who was "first", as
occasionally the first guild to move isn't respected as the first guild to
the encounter. I think leapfrogging sucks, but I've seen it happen where one
guild thinks the other is moving a little ways in, then pausing to get more
people.

    Our initial offer to them was a one day each rotation, no other strings
attached. The final agreement was the result of give and take between the
parties involved. We tried to be fair about it, and it bit us in the ass.
