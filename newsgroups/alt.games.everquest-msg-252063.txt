Never say never, I suppose, but I doubt very seriously that I'll be back.
However, it was neither GoD, CoH, nor the buggy code that did me in.

Ultimately, 3+ years of playing the same game was enough.  I probably stayed
in longer than I should have because of the people, but ultimately even that
wasn't enough of a driving force for me to renew.

There's a fine line between "Getting into a groove" and "Being in a rut".
At least there is for me.  YMMV.

The phenomenon is still interesting, though.  That's why I keep checking in
from time to time.  ;-)
