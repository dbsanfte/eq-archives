Auction to buy banded armor for 1pp per AC.  You'll get takers.    

If any of your bronze is large, auction that your will to trade it for
banded or medium bronze.  Some troll or ogre that just looted a piece
of medium will probably trade & you'll have lighter armor.  Some smith
that figures he can recoup some of his cost by selling the bronze may
trade.  

Head to High Pass & get in a group for the Shralock pack.  It is a
weight reduction bag.  Level 18 is great exp there.  

You might try a group in Permafrost with a good group.  Go for the
goblin archeologist.  He drops a weight reduction bag & the dented
brass mask.  The mask is a plus strength item.
