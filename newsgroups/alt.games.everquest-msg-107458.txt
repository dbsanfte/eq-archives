Breath of karana is an outdoor only, double resist check spell. It contains
an extra knockback feature that gives it an extra resist check. The net
result of course is that it is resisted far more often then a normal dammage
spell.

I assume you are talking about wildfire for your other refrence. It is kinda
hard to tell since your facts are so off. wildfire is level 59 , does 1024
dammage and costs 320 mana. This is a dammage to mana ratio of 3.2 . The
cleric closest equivalent is judgement(lvl56) 925 dammage for 325 mana a
ratio of  2.85. Reckoning a bit lower in level and thus with a slightly
worse ratio of 2.68.

we can tell therefore that way,way,WAY behind for you constitutes a 12%
diffrence.
