Until you get out of level 20, and loose your damage cap, you probably
won't ever be able to do much more damage than that with the sword...
in short, it's more a problem of your level than of the sword itself.
Offhand, i'd suggest keeping the Vellium Long Sword for a bit, it's a
good weapon for the level, and it'll let you hit wisps.

For around 70 plat, tho', I'd be on the lookout for an Axe of the Iron
Back.  Stay away from the Bone Bladed Claymore (the neg 8 agil may
well be a killer to your AC, I know it was for my dwarf pally), and
the Shiney Brass halbeard, which is simply too slow to be of much use
at your low level.

I'd also look around for a cheap handed blunt and two handed blunt
weapon.  You can probably find Veluim weapons quite easily, you'll
just be using them right now to keep your skill up should something
good pop up later on.
