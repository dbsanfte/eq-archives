Like I said, if I'm breaking any rules feel free to report me to VI. I
gave you my player name, can't be too hard to do.

Since when were we talking about bind point camping. Naked people at
their bind points don't give loot and are a waste of mana.

However there are times when I will kill naked people. If I see someone
who looks like they could be a pain any time soon (ie jumping into a
fight I'm going to have) then of course I will kill them. The last thing
I want is 3 extra lures or a 900dmg HT coming at me in the middle of a
fight from someone who has absolutely nothing to lose.

Nope.

PvP covers all forms of Player vs Player combat, fair or not.

There are better people at doing that. Ask one of the many nodrop lvl52
wizards, they have that title.

If I was level 60 and had a super computer I probably would have entered
the necro BotB. I did go and watch the BotB though (at 5fps...), the
person who won on RZ was a level 60 from the guild "The Begotten".

I can say that I probably would have beaten about half the people in the
BotB hands down, as most were just anti's who didn't know what they are
doing (ie the level 60 necro who lost to a level 54 because he didnt
bother casting a pet etc).

Don't think I would have beaten Zyrino (the winner), or Nimade (the
runner up).

> Those would be the ones having a valid claim to knowing what PvP is about.

Not really. Nimade gets owned fairly regularly, he tries to cast the
necro epic on people for crying out loud. Zyrino *does* know what he is
doing though, and he also has godly gear as well.
