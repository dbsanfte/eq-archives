DT, I was (obviously) making a joke.  To be serious for a moment...
If they were making code changes and just dumping them onto Test
without substantial internal testing first, there would be no
players on Test.  It would be an unbearable environment to play on
when it was even possible to log into it.  Believe me, with a system
as complex as EQ they're doing substantial testing of every change
candidate internally, the reason it so often looks like new stuff is
untested is <because> the system is so complex, with change atop
change atop change atop...  The odds agains a flawless roll-out of
anything are astronomical, and it's no surprise to me at all that
problems often slip by Test, especially since they frequently do
move things live within a week or so of trying them on Test.

So, to be brief, a "five minute" coding change costs so much more
than five minutes to deliver to the customers that the five minutes
could be anywhere from zero minutes to a couple hours without any
significant effect on the net cost of rolling it out.  The failure
of Marketeers and CS Managers to understand this has been the bane
of my professional existence.
