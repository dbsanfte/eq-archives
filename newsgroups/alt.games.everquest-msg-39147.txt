You can get a skill increase only if you get exp from the kill.  Since
very few greens give exp, practice on blues.  You haven't said your
level, but I found giant bats were good for practicing poorly
developed weapon skills (and binding wounds).

If you have faction to work on, find an already full group and
practice skills on their blue or higher mob.  (Ask if they mind
first.)  You'll get faction, weapon practice and be in a great
position if a spot opens in the group.
