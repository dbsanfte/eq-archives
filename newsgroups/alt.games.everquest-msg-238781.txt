Hindsight is always 20/20.<g> I have found that it's usually best to
discuss pulling in tells rather than group say. Some people seem more
willing to ask questions and offer suggestions in a private
conversation.

Strange. Cancel magic really is pretty low agro, if nothing else the
shaman should've been pulling the mob off fo you as soon as he cast
slow (resisted or not). 

To make that kind of a group (low DPS) work with a cleric pulling,
you'd almost have to keep the mobs in camp non-stop. Heading out to
pull while the group was still killing the previous one. Problem is,
that only works if the rest of the group is pulling their weight. ...
which doesnt' seem to be the case here.

You recognized early enough that your current strategy wasn't working
but you needed someone else in the group to take up the slack, which
never happened. Kicking someone out of the group at that point
wouldn't have mattered. It doesn't sound like the problem was any one
person but the whole group. 

On the bright side, it gets a lot easier once you get to lvl 65. 50s
LDoN can be a pain if your tanks are low level compared to the rest of
the group but once you get to 65 that isn't a problem any more. 

The group you described -- Cleric, shaman, druid and 3 tanks -- would
be one of my favorites at 65, 2 healers, a shaman for crowd control
and 3 tanks makes for a most excellent tank mez group. ... and if you
aren't worried about pulling singles, you spend a lot more time
actually killing mobs.  

I wouldn't worry, bad groups happen to everyone occasionally and I
don't see where you did anything wrong.
