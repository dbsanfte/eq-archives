I'm KOS to the Freeport Militia because I killed the WC Tollbooth guards
several times (7 to 8 times - that's 7-8 times each guard, not total), but
the Pallys who guard North Freeport are warmly toward me. I don't think it
would take much to get to "ally" with them (I kill any Orc that crosses my
path just for the heck of it).

If I max out my faction by wiping out the Orc camps a few times, could I fix
faction with the Freeport Militia by killing a few of the Paladins in North
Freeport and not end up KOS to them?

I know there's a quest you can do in Erudin to fix faction with the Freeport
Militia, but.... 1. It would require handing crap to the same character over
and over again for well over an hour. Maybe even a few hours. 2. It requires
someone to help. 3. I don't want to do it if I don't have to.

Its no biggie if I can't fix faction this way, because I can keep doing what
I've been doing: Using an alt to procure supplies from Freeport if I need
them and either finding someone willing to help with a transfer or doing the
old "shove in brew barrel or oven and switch characters" routine after
running the alt to wherever I have my main camped.

(I generally avoid Freeport altogether with my main - I have a bad habit of
getting a lag spike right after I walk through the gate in West Freeport,
and don't want to take the risk of Invisibility conking out on me, and I
can't risk going through the tunnels to get to North Freeport because I'm a
High Elf)
