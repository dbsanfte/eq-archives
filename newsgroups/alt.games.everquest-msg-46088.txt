The wizard drop spot is well north of the druid spot.  It's up the
west wall about 2/3 of the zone, and has quite a few mobs that wander
by.  Still I wouldn't really think it's that dangerous, since I've
never seen a trakoraptor there, and nothing else is sowed.  I'm sure
I've been jumped at the druid zone in, but can't remember ever having
it bother me, but having Selos always loaded does take the sting out
of being aggroed.  I used to like the wizard port a lot more before
everything greened out, was enough of a run to kite 2 mobs on the way
to TT zone.
