I'm sorry, but if you're wasting mana so your party can "feel good"
about the camp, it's time to find new people to group with.  That's
just a recipe for disaster as that usually means they people in

Then find a new game.
Anyone who still believes EQ is a roleplaying game is either:

1.  Terminally myopic.
2.  Under level 30.
