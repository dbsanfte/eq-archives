I decide what I want to be, and what my story is, just like I would
for a paper RPG. In the case of my Druid, I was an outcast, tolerated
but not welcomed, living the lonely forest life of a Druid. For that I
chose Half-Elf, a race traditionally frowned on by both humans and
elves. 
Ironically, due to many levels in Crushbone, the Dwarves like me
better than humans or elves.... I am amiable to any dwarf I meet,
except those special bandit ones in BB.
