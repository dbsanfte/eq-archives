An extra dime means you're closer to becoming a billionaire. Neither of
these are untrue, neither of these are worth crossing the street for.

As I understand it, strength *only* effects maximum damage, and has no
effect on any other hits. Therefore the 1% (or whatever) of hits where
you strike for maximum damage will get a slight increase in damage, but
the other 99% will stay the same, and your 'magic number' (the number
you hit for most often) will remain the same. This equates to a very
negligible amount of extra damage, greater than zero, but certainly not
enough to neglect ac, hp, stam, or resists for.
