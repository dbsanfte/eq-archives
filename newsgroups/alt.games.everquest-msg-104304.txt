Well that was an interesting weekend, I levelled from 14 to 15 delevelled
and then levelled again.

Just after making it to 15 for the 1st time, I moved to West Commons and
after killing a few willo-wisps I grouped with basically a few muppets, they
decided to goto Befallen because they said it gave good XP, so we did.

After entering the 2nd Level we found no real worthy kills so we decided to
vacate and go back to WC, but on the way back the leader took a wrong turn
and we ended up stranded with Mummies on the 3rd Level, Leader and friend
then disband and make a run for it leaving me and another not used to
Befallen to meet our deaths - gits.

Luckly a LVL 41 Ranger found and dragged my corpse for me to safety.

I then went back to increase my XP again in EC which was fine, then I
decided to goto Freeport to sell stuff, I entered North Freeport and saw a
NPC called Rin Distlemoor, as he was Green to me I thought why not kill him,
what a bloody mistake, one hit and he went running for the guards who
joyfully made me Lvl 14 again.

I then decided to join a grp at East Freeport gates and goto Oasis and the
Orc Highway, at last a group that knew what they were doing, and I levelled
back to 15 and managed to get halfway through 15 before logging out.

All in all an eventful weekend.
