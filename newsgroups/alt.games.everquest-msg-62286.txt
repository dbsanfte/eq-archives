Buy a Tinkerers Bag 100% reduction wt 1 cost 5250p or use summon bags but
with those you have to hit town and sell and bank before logging. Monks are
great characters but you must be able to afford playing a Monk because you
can't loot. My Monk only loots on Gems or drops that I can sell 50p or more.
