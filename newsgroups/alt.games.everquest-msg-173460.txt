I think you're a little confused.

Point systems are for guild raids, not open or invite raids.  The open and
invite raids tend to do /random, because they're typically one-shot deals.

Guilds tend to use point systems to keep track of peoples' attendance over
time.  Even if you don't raid that often, you'll eventually have a chance at
the item.  And you'll get that chance by putting in the same amount of
playtime as the person who raids every day.  Example:  Person A raids every
day.  They get one point per raid.  After 10 raids, they have 10 points,
which they spend on item X.  Person B can only raid once per week.  After 10
raids, they have 10 points, which they also spend on item X.  The only
difference is that A got his after 10 days, while B got his after 10 weeks,
because A plays more often.

And this is how it should be.

What you're saying is that you, who doesn't contribute as much, deserves an
equal chance at any item that you are able to equip as someone that
contributes more.  From your viewpoint, this is great.  But from the
viewpoint of the more active player, it's not.  And from the viewpoint of
the guild as a whole, it doesn't make much sense either.  The person that
raids more will use that item more, and that item will enable to guild as a
whole to perform that much better.

I've seen breastplates that would be a 15 AC upgrade for the main tank that
raids every day go to another tank who raids every two weeks, when it was
only a 5 AC upgrade for them.  All because of /random.  Now which tank would
get more mileage out of that breastplate for the guild as a whole?  The guy
who raids more often.  Putting it on him increases the guild's
effectiveness, and makes it that much easier to get breastplates for the
other folks in the guild that need them.

This is why the point systems, and things like them, exist.
