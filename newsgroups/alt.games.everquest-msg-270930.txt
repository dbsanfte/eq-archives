Well I mean I'll do what I can for you. If I'm in a group at Wall of 
Slaughter or something we're out of luck as you couldn't get there and I 
couldn't leave. But when I'm free or not too far off or somewhere you 
could safely get to, I'd be happy to buff you up.

And I wouldn't let one mean player rain on your parade. I don't know why 
any cleric would act like that. After all, you get into that class 
hopefully because you like helping people out, you know? Fortunately, at 
least in my experience, people like that are the exception and not the rule.

On another note though, while I don't care personally about making plat 
for buffs the fact is that those who stand around in PoK buffing are 
doing so to raise money for whatever reasons typically and for the most 
part donations for this time spent are expected by them. So I wouldn't 
expect free buffs in PoK all or even a lot of the time. I'd expect to 
pay the going rate and when I didn't have it ask someone if they'd be 
kind enough to buff you as you are a low level toon and broke. I don't 
think many would turn you down.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that is isn't really fair to have an 
expectation that there are free buffs in PoK ever. I mean when it 
happens or somebody doesn't mind, great. But people who give their time 
to buff others and had to earn or buy the spells to do so do deserve 
some compensation for their efforts in my opinion.

I'll give you a case in point. Clerics have to do a pain in the neck 
quest and camp a certain mob sometimes for hours to get temp. It's a 
fair amount of work to get it. And the only reason clerics go to this 
trouble is so they can provide their groups with this buff primarily. It 
doesn't exactly afford them some fabulous benefit other than being able 
to temp themselves when they like. And even at 20p a cast in PoK you've 
got to spend a lot of time standing around casting then sitting medding, 
etc. to make any money. So when these guys buff you they kind of have 
that donation coming. Again, that's just my opinion for what it's worth 
but I think it's probably one shared by many players.

I always give Enchanters 50p for casting KEI on me. It's nice of them to 
hang out in PoK making that very helpful buff available and I appreciate 
them doing it. But talk is cheap so I make sure I fork over the 50p. :-)

In another example, unless they get lucky on drops and are patient, the 
typical Cleric probably forks over some 2500p for Virtue and around 10k 
for HoV in the bazaar. And what does the cleric get out of HoV? Well not 
much really considering they could Virtue themselves for free anytime. 
But it's part of being a cleric to buff people for battle and so of 
course every cleric cannot wait to get spells such as these and many do 
pay these high prices for them or put in a lot of time going for the 
drops and random quest turn ins to get them.

I guess what I am trying to say is players who buff put a lot of effort 
and or money into obtaining these buff spells and then they spend their 
own valuable time hanging around in PoK buffing people. Given that, it 
is very reasonable and I think proper to offer them a decent donation 
every time. I don't think it's a good idea to make a habit of seeking 
buffs for free. If you want the buffs regularly, then you should find a 
means to raise the plat to pay for them unless somebody offers it you 
free or refuses a donation.

I can see asking a favor of someone once in a while, in a pinch. I just 
don't think it's good to make a habit of it and it sounds like you found 
yourself surprised one day that you couldn't land free buffs. It sounded 
to me like you expected to be able to. I don't really know why you'd 
expect that.

Anyway, once again, if I'm around or someplace you don't mind running 
to, I'll be glad to take care of you and I don't want anything for it.
