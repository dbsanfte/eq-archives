Ok, Here I go.


America is a powerhouse because We were pissed off on several occasions by
those idiots across our pond.  We needed weapons and gear, we got off our
butts and made it.  We also found better ways to do things faster due to
need.  War has always made for advancement in the USA.  It was the
Revolution that introduced standardized replacable parts for the rifle.
That idea spread over time for other products. The civil war advanced things
even further.

It is simple really.

As to the economics.... Welllll.  Before the unions forced change, our work
system was SEMI- Fuedal in nature. The power Barons of the age controlled
the nation from behind the scenes.  They were over thrown by followers of
believers in Marxism.  Fortunately, the ideas of the Republic overwealmed
that failed system.

Remember, America is NOT a Democracy. It is a Represenative Republic.  It is
based most strongly on the Roman system,, with bits of the Palament of
England thrown in.

Our Economy in America is great because we worked to make it great.


As to Everquest????  IT IS A DAMN GAME!!!!!!  Get over it.

LOL..
