No not really. Few roleplayers would choose to play in a world with no 
challenge, where they were commissioned highly menial dull tasks and 
rewarded like kings for their effort... thereupon becoming supremely 
equipped, and subsequently mowing through all opponents with ease... 
don't know about you but ... that would get dull fast for me. Since 
that's the default mode for EQ then I'm not surprised RPrs impose 
restrictions on themselves to up the challenge.

Sure... everyone knows the price of something like eggs shot up 1000% in 
gold-rush boom towns. Thing is boom towns became ghost towns overnight. 
In EQ the boom goes on forever... that pretty much sucks any heroism out 
of being a part of it. A trained monkey can get rich in EQ. And once 
your rich, you can buy sweet items and rock your way through levels 
without a snag... great.

If that's what your idea of fun is go for it, by all means. But if its 
not... or more likely ... you've already done it a few times that way, 
and you know that endgame is 99% either waiting to raid or looking for 
group...and you want to try some old-fasioned dungeon crawling in the 
lowbie dungeions...  and want to try to up the difficulty... then not 
getting twinked and questing your items will do that for you.

So what. Just because the game gives you a shortcut doesn't mean you 
must 'embrace' it. The long road has a lot more to see.

Its like the shortcuts in Super Mario brothers... sure you can warp to 
the end and beat the game in under half an hour. But so what... why skip 
3/4s of the game just because you can. Your not cheating... those warps 
aren't bugs or cheats... they're a part of the game. That doesn't mean 
you must 'embrace' them every time you play through.
