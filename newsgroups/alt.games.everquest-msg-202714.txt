Less difficult to parse now, as other's spell damage is showing.
However, it's going to be hard to figure out the interval over
which to apply the damage - most wizards wait a bit before cutting
loose, so their engagement time is going to show as less than
a melee's, thereby boosting their per mob DPS numbers.  A more
effective way would be to get their damage total for each mob and
average it, then compare it to the average damage - per mob - a
monk does.

2 rangers, 1 mage, 1 wizard, 1 druid, 1 cleric - our puller would
just grab a pair on a regular basis, get back, spin/root one, and
we'd usually take the first down before the 2nd broke root.  This
was Nadox, however, much easier wihout the "required" classes like
a slower and plate tank.
