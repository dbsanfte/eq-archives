Hehe, i have. But ignore list is limited to 30 people. Think i got 12 or
so on at the moment, including some idiot who tried to threaten all the
Wu armor sellers in NFP to sell it cheap, or he would "tell his guild
that they shouldnt buy from us (moron not anon, and not in guild), and
would shout that we were overpriced. Just resulted in him being banned
from buying Wu armor from any of the frequent Wu sellers in Freeport.
*s*

But problem is that you cannot just start /ign people as soon as they
beg for buffs, and you cannot know they are total jerks before you HAVE
discussed with them for 5 min. After that they can come on the ignore
list, but hard to do it before.
