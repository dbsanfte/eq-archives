I ran my 40 Bard through the Warrens with his best AoE DoT song
playing continuously, so as to improve faction standing
with Paineel.

I felt like Typhoid Mary -- everywhere I went, kobolds
would run away from me and then just drop dead en masse after
fleeing about forty feet.

It was kind of spooky, actually, especially since I've played
a Paladin for two years and never had much prior experience
with big DoTs.
