Try Paineel guards. No faction hits, and drop a bronze bastard sword and a
kite shield. I'm not quite sure what is the minimum level for killing them,
but you should be there or thereabouts.

One word of warning: Don't go for the newbie zone guards, or the guards near
the palace. The former are *drastic* undercons, and the latter are about 10
levels higher than the rest.

If you spend a while in the Warrens first for Heretic faction (or kill some
Erudin guards), you can even sell the stuff in the same zone and bank the
cash.
