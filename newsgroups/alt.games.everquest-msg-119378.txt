This is just what I needed to get this working.  Since unlike say Chains, I'm
not reapplying charm every tic if I leave it running, I'm free to do whatever
I like for 18 seconds or so.  Made an enourmous difference to me.

On the other hand, I shrugged off the "distance and speed" portion of your
advice quickly... running avocets in KFC with a 21 ranger partner, I'd
charm one mob, swap the other and tank till charm broke, then charm
-that- mob and fight the other direction, repeat until both mobs near death.
This worked like a charm (sic) with two mobs dead, me injured low enough
to allow me to practice bind wounds, and the ranger untouched... because
finally I've found a bard taunt!

Of course in the long run I'll need to learn how -not- to get hurt, but then
again, my cleric still melee's at 59... not just swinging, but on occaision
deliberately serving as MA.  Perhaps I'm just not capable of running
characters in the accepted "normal" way!
