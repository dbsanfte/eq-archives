I am happy with the new system also.  I had trained a Necro and an Enchanter 
using research runes (lots of farming) to the max they allowed.  I was 
facing the aspect of purchasing the required components in bazaar for 
skilling through spell creation.  I had full stock of the Words and torn 
pages for the two classes to level forty-nine.  Then came the hard part... 
the added ingredients, the rolled pages and odd components.  Now, I am in 
the process of converting those out-of-date components to Celestial Essence, 
as possible and needed.

Now, the only thing is that each spell level requires a different "pelt" so 
we trade one bank commodity for another.
