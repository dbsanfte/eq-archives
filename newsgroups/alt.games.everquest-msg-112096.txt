Hello All,
(OT) Looking for MMOFPSRPG Players

If anyone has heard about it great, if not you want to. Planetside is
a MMORPGFPS. Game launches in around 3-4 months we think. Imagine a
cross between the combat of CS, the development of Evercrack and the
graphic quality of Jedi or Tribes  3500 people per battle, 64x64 km
playing areas, 3 empires, freelancers, outfits, missions, vehicles
(tanks buggies, bikes etc) aircraft, (orbital drop pods, dropships,
bombers, jets), character upgrades (command XP, combat XP and
cybernetic upgrades) various armour types, stealth suits warp gates.
PlanetSide Website - http://planetside.station.sony.com/
Which brings me to The DreamScape Virus (www.dreamscapevirus.com),
European outfit currently at 103 members, are looking to be the
largest and best PlanetSide clan at launch. We are looking for people
with good strategy, FPS, and RPG skills, who are interested in
