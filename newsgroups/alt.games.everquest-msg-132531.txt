I just noticed last night that when I equip my AC items that it adds far
more than the item AC, especially when the AC is high.  Example a Netherbian
Chitin is AC 20, but when I put it on my little SK, it gave her 32 extra AC
points.  I guess I never paid attention before, but it's nice.  Anyone know
what effects the base AC?  How is it calculated?
