Why? They *are* games.

Hm. Either we live in parallel universes accidentally connected by 
Usenet, or I don't understand the sentence above, because sure as fuck 
Norrath was not modelled after the world *I* live in.

It's not "shocking", it's bad for the game and bad for legitimate 
players. It promotes patterns of behaviour that would not take place if 
there was no connection between EQ plat and RL money, and it makes the 
game less enjoyable for everybody else. It's not like I'm somehow naive 
and didn't expect it to happen, I fully know that where there is a money-
making opportunity some people will flock to it like flies to shit. I do 
expect Sony to protect the integrity of their game by stomping on them, 
because EQ was simply *not designed* to support that behaviour.

If, on the other hand, you were playing something like "There, Inc", 
where you are very much supposed to support your in-game lifestyle with 
your RL dollars, knock yourself out, I have absolutely no problem with 
that, because that's the way the game has been designed; but EQ 
certainly was not.

Yes you can. It's called "the Law".

And for the record, I have no problem at all with "greed" within the 
parameters of the game. If a level 65 is camping all the Crag Spiders in 
EK for their silk and leaving none for level-appropriate players because 
he wants to raise Tailoring, well, tough shit. On the other hand, if we 
have three teams taking turns and camping all the HGs in Rathe to sell 
the plat on Ebay, I do have a problem with that.

Certainly, if people want to do something, they will. Hopefully, if it 
goes against the rules, they will be punished for it, and they won't do 
it again. That's how "the Law" works.
