PCMag's been slowly going downhill for me.  Content has really
decreased, and advertising is way up.  It still has good things, but
not nearly as much as it used to.

The one thing I miss the most from the earliest PCMag was two extra
columns they had in their software reviews.

1) Would you (the reviewer) buy this software.
2) Would you accept it as a gift.

Silly but useful summations of the value of a given package.
