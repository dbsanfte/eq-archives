 May want to watch out if you're dueling. You can get aggro from nasty
places. The best thing to do is die to Sirran. That way you'll have more
than 10 minutes to res plus you wont get things like a train of all the
genies from the quest room. Although it's kinda funny seeing them all
come up and whack the people dueling.
