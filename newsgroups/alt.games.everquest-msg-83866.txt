Actually, whining in this newsgroup *is* acceptable.

It just has to be a specific *kind* of whining.

Whine about EQ?  Bad, bad, bad!

Whine about whiners?  Good, good, good!

I suspect I speak for a lot of people that visit this newsgroup
in saying that it gets very, very tiresome listening to people
whine about the whiners.  Just STFU and let 'em whine.  You don't
need to make matters worse by whining about their whining.

Oh, shit.  I'm whining about the whiners that whine about whiners.
