Heheh.  I did that with a Snow Cougar in Iceclad.

Actually, I'm still addicted to melee.  My "never attacks anything
anymore" above is more a goal than a reality.  Though I've been
playing a new Druid on Stromm lately, and he has no need to excuse
his BattleDruid[tm] status as he's only just dinged 20.  One nice
thing about Stromm has been that with the weak gear and lack of KEI
there is a lot more grouping going on, I've grouped way more getting
Firjak to 20 on Stromm than getting Medra to 37 on FV.  Of course,
that makes meleeing while solo all the more fun, since I end up on
my ass 95% of the time grouped.  Root parking is about the only
"action" I see grouped as I've been very careful of agro in groups.
I watched way too many Druids die to poor agro management in their
late 20s and early 30s when mobs start hitting harder.  I don't see
any reason to suffer when others have been so thoughtful as to have
already done it for me.
