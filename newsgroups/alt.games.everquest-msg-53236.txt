If you want to get tailoring up to about 150, I can't think
of an easier method than by farming the spiders in CC;
they drop crystalline silk by the bardic tonne, and you
can make crystalline silk armor, pieces trivial starting at
106 and go up piece by piece to almost 150 (146?)

In one night I brought out 5 stacks of the stuff, and I wasn't
serious about farming it at the time.
