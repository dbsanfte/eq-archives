To anyone who has been around awhile, 150p for a BABS seems an incredable deal.
And 200p as a normal price seems outrageous.

I was running thru E Commons the other day and someone did a PC on a BABS
and got a reply of 300p and it stopped me in my tracks. I was in GFay the 
other day and someone did a PC on a Silver Swiftblade and someone responded
500p.

I had someone give my ranger a Stormwood Battlestaff once, does this mean
the thing is worth nothing? After using it for 10 levels I traded it and
2Kp for a Swarmcaller, does that mean the Swarmcaller is worth 2Kp?

So, I know people get deals, but what are these things worth?

(Personally I think they need to fix runnyeye again, or close it for 
awhile so I can unload this enormous pile of 2HS weapons that is building
up on my alts).
