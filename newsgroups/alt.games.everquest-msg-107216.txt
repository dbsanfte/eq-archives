Wow, you sure that you are playing the same game we are?

In my guild there is one 60 druid, several 50+ druids, and quite a few lower
level druid alts.

I have several freinds outside the guild that play high level druids as
well.  Believe it or not, there are quite a few druids out there still.  I
can't say that I have noticed a significant lack of them at any level, up to
and including 60.
