LOL you totally ignore ergonomics (and admit to it) and you wonder about
pain?

INVEST in a good chair ($125 minimum, probably).  ATTEMPT to sit more
correctly.

Get the monitor down to eye level (jury is out on what the correct height
is, but you shouldn't be looking up).

Try a different mouse.  It could be your pinky is numb because of what it's
doing...is it being dragged all over the place?  Put in funny positions?

Get a keyboard drawer and get it off your lap.  Ideally your keyboard drawer
will be big enough for your mouse as well.  Your wrists don't need support
if your keyboard & mouse are at a good height.

Lord knows I'm not perfect; my mouse is too high and my legs are often
crossed under my chair, and sometimes I put the keyboard in my lap...and
sometimes I have problems similar to what you describe, too.  I figure I'm
on my way to CTS (right hand has been weaker than usual for a while, but I'm
also horribly out of shape so that might be it too) but I try to avoid doing
the STUPID things you do regularly. :)
