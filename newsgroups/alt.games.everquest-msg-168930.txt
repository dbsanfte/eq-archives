Me and some friends were CoV rebels and used to hunt in skyshrine all
the time, mostly because of the guardian armor that dropped and the
fact that hardly anyone else ever hunted there (and getting CoV back
isnt that hard). Has anyone hunted here since they redid the zone? Is
it harder - easier? Any new drop info? Thinking about reliving old
times, but am scared they gave it the 'ol Cazic-Thule facelift (ie 55+
zone).
