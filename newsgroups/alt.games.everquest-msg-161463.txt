What do you expect?  The media has it's story, it's the only word that many
people get.  And, even then, you have to listen carefully for the facts and
filter out the editorial.  If the media was truely neutral, the "moderate"
position would be several notches to the right of where it currently is.

Hmm, one point came to mind as I was reading that.  People say that Bush
just does what Rumsfield and Powell tell him to do.  Do they realize that
those two are pulling Bush in opposite directions?  It's Bush's job, as
president, to take the information that his advisors bring him, digest it,
and come to his own conclusions.  No matter what he does, he's going against
one of the two.

It's fun listening to Rush, and Bortz, and the like howl when Bush goes to
the UN to ask for a resolution, or to congress asking for authority (which,
as Rush correctly points out, he already had) for a new stage of the game.
Yes, their arguments may be techinically correct, but Bush realizes that
there's alot more to weigh than simply "I will because I can, so neener."
How anyone can watch as Bush lines up each part of the puzzle, and still
think he's an idiot is beyond me.  Yeah, I know, it's his handlers, not him.
