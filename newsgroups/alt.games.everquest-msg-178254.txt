No, that's basically it. It's a palette overlay on the current texture, 
and it's no different than looking at it through appropriately-colored 
cellophane. If used very tastefully, it may just about work on armor 
that doesn't have much of its own color, but on something like those 
armors with gold detailing, it will be a bit of a mess. It's not really 
Sony's fault, just an inherent limitation of the system.
