Wow excellent tip, should put it in its own thread!

I've only used two charges so far, its more a "last resort" item than a 
tool at this point (unlike SOW potions, which I'll eat on my way to a 
camp which has a shaman in it, just because I don't want to spend the 
extra 5 minutes travelling)'

But it shouldn't be much trouble to keep an eye on it and trade it in 
when I get down to one charge left.  Heck, I'll buy a second and that 
way I won't even have (potentially) to run to Bazaar and hope for a 
replacement if I really need one.
