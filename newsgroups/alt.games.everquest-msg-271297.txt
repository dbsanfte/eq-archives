for reasons I'm sure no one here cares about, my Christmas this year sucks.   
I didn't even bother with a tree.  Years ago, I was the annoying girl who 
wore a Santa hat from the day after thanksgiving till New Years and also 
listened to carols 24-7 the whole time.  This year, hat still in storage, 
no decorations, no carols.  I would stay home and not go to my sister-in-
law's house for Christmas dinner but that would mean I'd have to provide 
one more day of meals for my family and we just don't have it.  I'd go on 
with my crappy life but I guess this isn't the place for it.
