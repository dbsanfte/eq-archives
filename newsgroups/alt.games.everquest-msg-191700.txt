    Unless they changed the faction requirement, that won't work. You used
to need Amiable to get the hammer, and someone else's pet will just be
Indifferent to you. Only your own pet will be Amiable.

    It should be easy to test this, of course. Find an enchanter with
Project Illusion and hope you haven't hosed your faction too much with the
outpost. But when my buddy first did the quest, back when Kunark was young,
it was Amiable that was required.
