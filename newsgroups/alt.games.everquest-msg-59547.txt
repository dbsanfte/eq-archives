On EMarr, I've noticed Felodius Swordsinger...(or whatever the guy's name is
who's usually in East Karana at the bottom of the ramp coming down from
Highpass)...standing in Astaed Wemore's place.  I don't know what's going on
here.

BTW, for those who don't know, it's in the grounds of the Temple of Life in
Qeynos, in the big yard in front of the fish pond.
