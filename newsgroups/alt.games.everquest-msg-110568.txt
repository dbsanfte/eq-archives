It's called a twink.  The 'Gold' armor you saw on the chest, had you
examined it, is called 'Brown Chitin Protector'.  It has a plate look, and
is damn heavy.  There are items that are all all wearable that will looke
like plate, such as the Golden Effreet Boots, and the Runed Mithril
Bracers.  There is also the Elder Spiritus Gear that gives a chain look on
Druids.
