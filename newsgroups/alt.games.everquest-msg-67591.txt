1 point into each skill at is becomes available, until level 10. Drop all
40ish points you'll have saved up into backstab. You may want to even hold
off for several levels on pick lock and sense traps and whatnot, because
those skills are utterly useless before level 10 (and pretty much useless
all the way up to level 50, where suddenly they have a miniscule amount of
usage). Backstab is one of the most crucial skills to raise, and also one
of the most difficult. Putting a huge number of points into it right from
the start will save you an enourmous amount of headache.
