    Disco one. MAYBE Disco two (we once had a skillful rogue get past the
Grup PH to pull bodies, but that's not a sure thing). Chef. Necro Jail. The
camps in Seb, excepting D1/2 and Arm/Bar and Chef, usually aren't within
clearing distance of each other.

    Velk's has the same feature that I loved in Sol B - instead of sitting
at zone and LFG'ing, I can wander from camp to camp on my rogue and ASK
groups if they'd like me. Most groups are much more willing to add someone
that's taken the initiative to come to them.
