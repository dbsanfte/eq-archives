I can't see them porting characters - the bare basics
of the new character system indicate that it is completely
different from the old one.

You don't even pick a class before 6th level, and then
only a basic class.  You specialize that class further
at 15 and 30th.  They've already mentioned 3 new skill
areas.  Also - how do you deal with the rare items that
people put huge time into getting in a world where items
break down?
