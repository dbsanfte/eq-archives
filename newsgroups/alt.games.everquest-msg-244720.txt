Don't think "link" is the word you're looking for. A link would be
something you click that pulls up other info such as item links that
pull up item stats when you click them.

If you mean making it so that you can say to your group "casting on
soandso", then the line you would want in your hotkey is "casting on
%t". %t will be replaced with the name of whatever you have targeted.

By the way, there's no z in "please". 3 more letters won't kill you.
