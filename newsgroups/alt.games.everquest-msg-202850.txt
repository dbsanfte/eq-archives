Oh, Kiss my ass with your "Old Timer" crap.

I am fed up with you OLD WHINERS. Things change. If you are so stuck
int he mud that you can't move ahead then you deserve to eat the dust
of those who can accept change and move along.

I bet yoou hated it when YOUR fater told you stories about how easy
YOU had it growing up compared to how HE had to grow up didn't you?
