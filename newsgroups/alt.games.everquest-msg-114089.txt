It's quite possible that this is a druid. In the appropriate level
range, Shadowed Men are awesome exp. They are suceptable to Harmony so
you can single pull, are summoned so the ward summoned line nukes them
with awesome efficiency.
At 24, I could solo 3 shadowed (sometimes with pets) before needing to
med. They were blue to yellow then, with green to blue pets.

I preferred the 4-spawn near KFC, myself. Plenty of room to snare and
run if needed, and a zone line nearby if things go really hairy. Once,
after Harmony the pet of one I pulled took a detour through the mass
of Shadowed Men. Harmony does not remove aggro, it just reduces the
range a lot. That damn pet managed to round up every damn one of them
on it's way over. Damn pet pathing!
I looked like a madman, running for the zone line being chased by a
gaggle of hovering weapons.
