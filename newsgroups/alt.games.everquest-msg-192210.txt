Hmmm

1) Mob inc, add, add, add, wipe out = zero exp gain and at least 4% loss on
rez

2) Mob inc, add, add, add, Charm add, sic add on other add, root park other
add. Oh No! We have lost up to 33% exp on some of those kills. Overall
result exp gain no wipe-out.

The cleric and the shaman in the tale are ultimate grandmaster fucktards.
