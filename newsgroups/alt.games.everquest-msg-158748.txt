I got mine by ordering from Electronics Boutique... be aware these network
things for PS2 are constantly on back order. None of my local stores had
them, and I had to get them online- and even then it took two weeks to
arrive.

I do reccommend a keyboard. It's very hard to have a REAL conversation
without one, although they have a few choice phrases tucked in
there.(Whassup, thou?)
