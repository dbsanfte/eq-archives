Advantages with new spells (just talking from druid perspective, some of 
it will apply to shammys too):

Druids can be usefull in end game groups (try getting a group if you 
heal slower than the mob hurt the tank).

Dont NEED a cleric to go anywhere (cant even count the groups/raids that 
never happened because no cleric were available).

Druids as backup heal on major raids. Were not as good as clerics, but 
now you dont have to cancel a big raid due to only having 3 clerics 
instead of 4, put a few druids in and get them to cast a few sec before 
(1-2 sec and the clerics 4 sec). This should make people able to do more 
big kills, AND not neccesarily be wiped if 1 cleric go LD.

Probably a lot more, but all i can think of at the moment since im not 
even the level to get the spell.

Problems with the new spells:
Clerics can be replaced in groups. I doubt this will happen much, due to 
clerics having better heals, having group heals, actually being quite 
decent meelee fighters now, and able to rez fallen comrades. Clerics got 
to be a more all round char than JUST healer. A group would be STUPID to 
take a druid over a cleric just for the heals.
