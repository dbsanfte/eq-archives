In Kaev's case, I think it was rather obvious a joke. Considering that the
comment was all one paragraph, it's usually safe to presume that they're all
on the same subject - which is why I think it's obvious he was joking.

Heh, I've learned that people will generally get offended by anything. I've
used those before, and it usually passes right over people's heads.

What he wrote was all one paragraph, and the punch line was at the end. That
is the indication that the entire thing was a joke.
