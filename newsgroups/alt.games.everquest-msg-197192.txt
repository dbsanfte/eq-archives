Decay times (These are absolute.  You may not extend them by logging off.):
Pre-level 10: 30 minutes.
Level 10+ (naked): 3 hours.
Level 10+ (geared): 7 days.

Rez times (These only count down while the account that the character 
belongs to is logged in on the server where the corpse exists.  Two 
additional notes: 1) Character select screen counts as logged into the 
server, you have to exit at least to the server select screen; 2) Even if 
you are playing a different character on the same account, the rez timer 
for any corpses belonging to any other character on that account will count 
down.):
Pre-level 11: Not sure, the only reason to get one would be that the person 
forgot to bind themselves somewhat near where they are hunting.
Level 11+: 3 hours.

One other thing along this line: consent to drag corpses persists even 
after you camp.  This makes it possible to consent a higher level character 
on the same account for corpse recovery purposes, or to consent a friend 
who will be on later to recover your corpse for you.
