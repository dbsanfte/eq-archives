Societies are a concept that won't be fully realized until a couple of
bugs are wiped out.

But basically, the society levels as it's members earn society points by
doing quests.  As the society levels, and your standing rises within
that society, it's vendors (and you) will have access to more items.
There may be more to it, but since societies don't level as of yet that
we've been able to determine, we don't know. :-)
