I read an interview with the director in which he was asked
why, if the filming was done all at the same time, they didn't
release the films closer together, like maybe 6 months apart.

His reply was that he wished they could do that, but the
enormous amount of post-production work required for the
films (special-effects, mostly, plus editing, sound, etc.)
simply made it impossible to finish each film less than
about twelve months apart.
