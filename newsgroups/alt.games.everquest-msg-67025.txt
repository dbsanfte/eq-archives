If I didn't love my class then I wouldn't be pushing for better changes -
only logical if you think about it.  If your comments are taken seriously,
then no one would ever try and make changes for the better.  Yes, I would
never switch classes, no I don't like complaining, yes I do love my class,
yes I do hate the way Verant and a lot of other players treat it, and yes I
do think we should improve what we can.

Oh and if you really want a break, then just don't read the posts.  If you
continue to read, then obviously you don't want a break.  I started this
topic, and I will defend my class to the last :-).  Please don't think I am
hung up over this, I am just very passionate when I am focused on something,
and I can tell you my life does not revolve around this topic :-).  Only
have to look at numerous threads in this newsgroup to find similar people
:-).
