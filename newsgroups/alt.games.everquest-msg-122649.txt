Does this mean that those sirens outside the entrance to SG will no
longer be able to reliably stick their greenie charm to a passing 60 warrior
with a 250 MR?  Not that I minded so much since the warrior in question
hit for a max of 24 a pop; apparantly you lose all your class/level/stat based
damage multipliers when charmed.   What worries me is a charmed
druid (or wizard, but I hunted hairs for my druid friend there a lot, so
its -her- massive nuking that haunt my memory)
