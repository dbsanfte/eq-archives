It's a lot more likely to just enable you to act like a merchant, with
the possibility of adding a /auction.   The only zone I'd expect it to
work in is Bazaar on Luclin, as well.   There's no reason to have EC
or GFay populated by 100+ people when you can go to a dedicated
zone with two banks as well as tradeskill vendors and combiners.
