Got to Options/keyboard where the camera controls are and look
for the key combinations for tethered camera movement.  These
are the ones that swing around your head.  Also, the shift/alt
keys got really messed up in the last patch - I had to go redo
a bunch of keys (like shift+Numpad# for hotkey banks became
alt+Numpad#).
