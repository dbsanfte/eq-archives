Subject: Is there a character more powerful than a Necro?

From what I can tell there sure isn't.  My level 28 Erudite Necro can solo reds
in Dawnshroud Peaks.  Level 28 should, theoretically, be a weak level for the
Necro because his pet is weak compared to his level and he'll get a new pet and
many new damage spells at 29.  Now the only other characters I've played past
level 28 are a wizzy and pally but neither one of them would be able to even
think about taking on a yellow much less a red.  Especially one level before a
new rank of spells.  I wish I'd have played the Necro from the get go, or does
it get harder?
