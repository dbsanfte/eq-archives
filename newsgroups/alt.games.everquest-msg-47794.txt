 Well said. I'm an "older guy", early forties. I've worked long and
hard for 25 years to have a nice car, a nice home, etc, etc.. I've
endured a lot of crap, sacrificed a lot for a pension and done a lot 
of boring, tedious things so that I might be comfortable later on.
I'm just beginning to start enjoying that sort of thing now.
 
 What I've seen in the past 20 years is younger people, more and 
more, want it all "right now" without putting the time and effort to
get it. They throw enormous anounts of time, energy and money down
the crapper becuse they can't bear to wait, they can't see any 
farther than tomorrow, or they don't believe tomorrow will ever 
come. This attitude is rampant today and it's manifesting itself
in our little game we play as well. 
  
 Ye reap what ye sew. You get out of life (and EQ) what you put 
into it. Nothing more, nothing less.
 
 Grow up people. Have a little patience. Put a little work into it.
You'll like life, yourself, and EQ a lot more.
