    I'd follow that advice, with one caveat. Save up all those Words you get
hunting, even for spells that can be vendor-purchased. At 24, raise skill by
buying up the skill until you're at the level 20 cap. Then start attempting
the non-essential spells you have the Words for BEFORE buying up the skill.
You can usually gain a fair chunk of research points without having to buy
them by doing this.

    That seems very, very wrong. The reason it's in Ogguk is because it's
also a Shadow Knight pet spell. So you'd THINK it would be located in every
SK guild accross the world, including the Dismal Rage guild in Freeport.
Check there first if you have the faction to do so. I know my baby necro got
hers in Paineel's SK guild if you want a place it might be easier for you to
gain the faction to access, and as a follower of Inny you MIGHT even be able
to check the Neriak SK guild.

>(And as for getting
>somebody else to research it, I haven't even found the words yet.)

    Look up the words for the level 24 pet spell NOW, and every time you use
a vendor check for them. I believe the rare word is Detachment for that guy.
My level 24 necro, with eight characters total looking for necro words, has
TWO sets of words for that pet, which isn't on any vendor (it isn't a SK
pet). Those will be some very tense combines....
