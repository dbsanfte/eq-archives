I don't think the relatively small regen from the ICC is really going to 
  make much difference for this.  Twisting in Hymn on occaision isn't 
such a chore anyway, and you shouldn't need to do it much at all, if you 
have its because you did something wrong, you aren't supposed to get 
hit!  12  angry mobs beating on you at once isn't something ICC is going 
to take care of, what you need is a epic cleric standing by.

TBoots work 99% as well as JBoots; yes they aren't insta click, but for 
a bard this matters much less than for other classes, because bards 
don't have to stop moving to use clickies, and getting hit interrupts 
them less because the movement component doesn't interrupt, they have to 
actually get stunned.  Not that JBoots aren't better, but you can get 
the TBoots in ten minutes instead of an average of 10 hours for 
JBoots... assuming the extra 5Kpp isn't a problem.

A right click invis item that doesn't take charges would be very handy, 
but I've never seen one in the bazaar nor in my bouts of wandering 
around in LOIO hoping the guy that drops the animal one would happen by. 
  Easier to just juggle in a flute and sing invis, frankly, only have to 
learn how to think 3 seconds in advance, and thats a necessary bard 
talent anyway.
