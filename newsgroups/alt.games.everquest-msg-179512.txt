I wonder what "incentive" there will be to buy this one. With pop they had
to force us by excluding us from "raid" if we didnt upgrade. If you dont
upgrade, guild kicks you out. (any guild worth its salt)
Ahh... ive got it! Make it necessary to have the guild tool to turn on
guildchat. So if you dont upgrade it fucks you up with your guild. Bravo!
Maybe I can get a job working for Sony marketing.
