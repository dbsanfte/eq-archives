I don't think a polite request would be met though, at least not by bizbee,
he said as much himself with his very first post :
"It's always polite to ask, but I'm afraid that if the raid leader said
"no," I'd simply go ahead and do as I pleased anyway"

> I'd discount additional lag from a single player as being a reasonable
reason

Ok so its 2 people?  Or his group? Or his small guild turns up? 1 person, 2
people, 6, 10.. where do you draw the line?
Lag can suck ass on the best of days (specially if other raids are happening
in the zone at the same time), and yes even just 1 extra person does add
lag - what happens if the cheal rotation or MA goes link dead because of the
lag?

Id love to know just what sentinel actually does.. theres a cleric one that
gives a similar effect too...

As for reps - well the cleric who ninjad our Lodi shield did have a rep
(they stole a guildies AoN prior to the shield)
But the person who ninjad the 10th ring war head (much much much worse) was
just an unknown random guildless player

If i was completing my monk final battle again, and an unknown monk was
stood there, not speaking, refusing to leave.. I would have concerns that he
was going to ninja the item (meaning I'd have to restart my epic)

Call it paranoia, but if i feel concerned, if I feel threatened, then its
arguable that his presence is making me feel harassed - which is against the
PnP policy

Maybe it is paranoia, I used to be naive too though, I used to trust people,
and I got screwed bigtime as a result.. if theres one thing you learn in
life, its to try and avoid the same mistakes again, else whats the point?

Well I agree with you mainly, in my last post i said

In most cases we have no problem with people "tagging along" on our raids,
our last vindi killing had a group or so of an opposition guild who came to
grab a faction hit (not a guild were on great terms with either) but that
was fine.

if were clearing nToV though, thats a totally different story.  If they
aren't with us and refuse to leave, im quite sure my guild leader would
petition to have them removed.
####

Kael can have many raids/groups/soloers all over the zone, generally in ToV
thats not the case (and a wipeout in ToV is much much worse, god forbid if
its caused by somebody tagging along who refuses to leave)

If yu turn up RIGHT at somebody elses camp spot though, and its obvious your
there for that (if your at Tormax ramp and kos, your not 'passing by' or
questing) and your asked to leave, I can't see a single valid reason why you
would stay (im not talking about every person in every zone being told to
move).

If you are being asked to move, chances are there is a perfectly valid
reason for it, and to say "if he says no id just stay anyway" well your just
being an ass, and I've not met a gm yet who thinks otherwise
