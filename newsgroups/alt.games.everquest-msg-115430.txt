    Well, yes and no.  There are several spots that are bind
capable that don't have soul binders, such as the gypsy camp
in the Karanas and that aweful spot in the Frontier
Mountains.  Also, it is handy to be able to bind yourself
and others in city zones where there is a soul-binder, but
not exactly right where you'd like him to be.  Evils can be
be bound in Freeport, for example, as long as you park them
by the wall near the tunnel, where the guards rarely go (I
know this from experience, my husband Lenny decided to pitch
his ranger and go with an Ogre Warrior).  Also, at some
point my elf cleric is probably going to fight in the
Overthere, it will be nice to be able to bind at the
Outpost, again, away from the guards.
