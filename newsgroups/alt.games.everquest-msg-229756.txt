From the shadows, the mysterious Lance Berg <emporer@dejazzd.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Want to know something even more interesting?

Of those newsgroups, the only ones that have anywhere near the same
number of people topposting as bottomposting are the two aussie
auction groups. Two of the three comp are difficult to judge since
theres very few replies compared to new threads, but the last one for
sure is a bottom posting group.

It's also amusing to note those who are topposting are not trimming
either and generally behave like IE noobs who start typing where the
cursor is placed.

Apparently this Andrew fellow is either a liar or just plain stupid.
In either event, if he'd like to try again with some new evidence,
some that DOESN'T contradict his own statements, he's welcome to go
try...

I suspect he'll just slink away and try to pretend this thread didn't
happen, however.

It's been shown that when people throw out connectionless insults in
such a fashion, they tend to be projecting that which they dislike
most about themselves.

At least us "pre-pubescent children" know 1. how to post on usenet
properly, and 2. how to avoid lies that can easily be tracked down on
google.
