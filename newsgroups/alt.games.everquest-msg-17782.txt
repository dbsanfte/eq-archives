Hmmm. I like this change. I have a lvl 6 cleric in GFay which occasionally
has to run from a train of orcs to the guards. Casting this shield might
prevent a train to the guards.

Also I hope this means that stupid green lvl 1 skellies won't aggro on you
when you med in the middle of nowhere. It can hit me, but only 1 out of 30
attacks or so for 1 dam and it will die with a 99.9999% certainty. I know
they're brainless, but even then you can't be THAT stupid :)


Kilmir, who tends to damshield himself in low lvl zones before medding.
