PATCH MESSAGE, JULY 31, 2002 
We apologize for updating the servers on such short notice. As a
bonus, /hitsmode functionality is now available in the new UI. Please
check out the context (right-click) menus from New UI Chat windows.
Hopefully this version is somewhat easier to understand. 

General Enhancements and Tweaks

NPC and PC names display settings should be saved between sessions. 
Bazaar Search Window is now resizable. 
Disabled Begging and Stealing in the Bazaar 
The New UI Train window no longer cuts off any skill names for INT
casters.
