Seriously, there's always something for a druid to do. If nothing else, 
nuke and buff. The clerics handled the heals and the mage likely took care 
of the damage shields. Snare, root park adds, DoT if fights are lasting 
long enough and nuke.

My druid isn't that high a level, but I've never had any trouble finding a 
role for him. Don't know how animal charm works at your level, but you can 
likely also add significant DPS with a pet.
