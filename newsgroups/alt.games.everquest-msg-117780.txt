}my story so far im now in a guild the legend of the forsaken which is cool
}as they are prety helpful as it took them ages to teach me the "who GUILD
}all" command apparently i was not putting the / in front and all it came up
}was "you say to your guild: all" but they were really patient as it took me
}like 5 mins to finally get it right. and there were other embrassing
}situations like my first time being a tank and everyone told me to bind "INC
}%t" but when they said put a t next to the % i thought it was INC percentt
}or INC percent%. ghee i felt stupid but everyone was supportive. so i really
}like the community i have never meet anyone bad yet :).

You're new.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with not knowing everything 
right off the bat.  You have no cause to feel stupid.  Judging by the 
number of times I've had to explain the /who all GUILD command and 
/g INC %T to people, these are non-trivial tasks that everyone has at 
least 5 minutes of trouble with the first time. :)

}but im really getting into the role playing like i see myself is a last
}defender character who always goes down to let the others live.  and i made
}a whole heap of binds like:

Don't call them binds.  It will probably be confused with your bind point 
or casting bind affinity at some point.  It's Making A Hotkey.

}my heroic phrase
}"run you fools Dareydiel looks back to the %t(which means the monster im
}looking at) and shouts You shall not pass!"

Why are you calling the rest of your party fools?  

}my need healing phrase
}"my friends, i would surely die if i do not get aid soon"
}
}my incoming phrase
}"i have lured a %t to his doom"
}
}when i use death ward for added effect
}"I call on the power of Mithaniel Marr BEGONE %t"
}
}my low on mana or oom phrase
}"The essence of my God is weakening I must pray to Mithaniel Marr for more"

You may wish to add the word 'mana' to the end of that.  If you hadn't 
told me, I never woulda guessed it meant 'oom'.

}my thanks for buffs and general thank you phrase
}"I thank you kind soul may Mithaniel Marr bless you on your journeys"

Other than the two little quibbles there, these are excellent!  I wish 
more people put the time and energy into these things that you are.  Heck, 
I should do more of that myself. :)

}i guess your thinking im getting carried away but it prolly cause i play
}AD&D and i really like to role play (maybe i should go on FV server?) but i
}was wondering do you guys do this? do you guys play it like a game or play
}it like an actor i dont know if im making sense but i just like to get some
}ideas for other cliche fantasy sayings :)

My characters have individual personalities, and are clearly different 
from each other.  but they are also all clearly me.  It's like they're 
shards of me.  What's really scary is sometimes I think my gnomish 
enchanter is playing me in real life.  Like when I bump my 6'2" high 
noggin on a too-low door frame...

}also the other day i saw a high level necro in action and i must say im
}starting to think being a paladin is a wrong choice.

There is no wrong choice.  Well, Pallies suxx0rs though. :)  No, not 
really.  They are a challenge to play well, but a well-played Paladin can 
truly rock.  Necros are fun too.  Personally, I suck pretty badly at 
playing either of those classes. I seem to do best as an Enchanter, 
Warrior, or Shadowknight.

}also where do you get
}cool magic items all my stuff comes from buying at auctions the only magicl
}thing i found was lockjaw leather armour and i did kill it just looted the
}croc i dont want to spend ages killing some pathetic weakling monster (in
}this case camping orcs to get deathfist belts to sell for 4 plat each) to
}make money to buy awesome equipment.

To get better equipment, get more levels.  Farming money just doesn't help 
nearly as much as levelling up to where you can hunt the beastie that 
drops the Screaming Item of Uberness yourself.

}When i imagine my paladin i think she
}goes on grand adventures fighting monstrosities of evil to gain a magical
}item, but all her adventuring is in haggling with a merchant in a zone next
}to her starting city for a good price on the  magical item hardly heroic, im
}18th level  i must be high enough to be a hero now right?

You can be a hero no matter what level you are. :) I've met level one 
heroes even.  To me a hero is anyone willing to go the extra mile to help 
someone.
