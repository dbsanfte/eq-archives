The No Drop "A Jagged Shard of Bone" that I got in LFay during
the weeks-long GM event there has been nerfed without announcement.

It used to be usable in the primary and secondary hands.  Now
all of a sudden it is secondary only, which makes it impossible
for my Paladin to use the damned thing.

I really liked it too, it was a dagger that proc'ed Fear, which
could be very useful at times.  Now all I can do with it is
Destroy it to make room in my bank, since I can't equip it,
and can't sell it.
