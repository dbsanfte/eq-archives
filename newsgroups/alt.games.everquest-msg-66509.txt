Just to clarify all this, at no time did Verant promise us a free horse.
There was a spell for summoning a horse on the test server for some time,
but as we know that is no guarantee it will go live.  Just before the
release of Luclin the spell was removed from test and replaced with the
current system - in the alternate advancement.

Sure it sucks that we have to wait that long just to get it, what is even
more wrong though is that we have to wait the same time to make LoH a
complete heal, something that we should get from level 1.  By the way, I
don't think the alt advancement system is quite as bad as what some people
say.  Someone said it was actually half the exp of level 51, not the full
level.  That would make it around about the same exp as level 40.
Regardless, most level 60 Paladins have reported that they can get about 1
yellow per hour.

Having ranted on with all my other I would like to thank Verant for giving
us Instrument of Nife (totally awesome against undead) and Valor of Marr (we
are now much more soloable).  These two in particular but other spells are
nice as well.  But apart from what ToK was there is still (and of course
with the nerf this is true once again) that is a class defining ability, nor
makes us wanted on raids.  Now that is what SUCKS.
