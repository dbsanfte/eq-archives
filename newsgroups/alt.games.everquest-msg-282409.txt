What gives YOU the right - and on what basis - to state categorically
it was intended as "a disgusting racial slur"?  Have you ever seen
evidence of where bizbee stands regarding racism?  Do you actually
KNOW where he stands?  Do you know what race he is, or what racial mix
his friends are?  Nahh, didn't think so.
