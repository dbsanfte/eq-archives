>>>Start out the same way you did, gather shadows and jump down the hole,
<<<

Gather Shadows is not the spell you want. Invisibility to Undead, which is a
level 1 necro spell, is what you want to use.

Gather Shadows makes you invisible to living creatures, not undead ones. The
skeletons at the very beginning of Befallen are real low level, that's why
they didn't attack you.
