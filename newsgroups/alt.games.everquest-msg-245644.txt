Hm, my druid buddy and I quad kited in Cobalt very easily. I sat on my 
droggie between the rock and the skyshrine temple-port and combined 
celestials in my mortar, and popped an occasional heal on him, and an 
occasional earthquake as he ran them in circles around me. Just a bit of 
a different technique. Was easy once I knew when in the orbiting to 
start casting quake so it would hit when the target and rest of the mobs 
got into position=)

We made serious plat selling wyverhide armor kits [everthing in 1 BP for 
20 combines, hide, cod oil, Celestials and the like] to people for 
skillups=)
