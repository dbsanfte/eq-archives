My rogue has made some decent platinum doing corpse recoveries

Summon items.  When I played a mage on FV, I earned some decent

I've never played a monk.

My paladin has earned some decent platinum doing rezzes for

So your gripe is that druids and wizards charged too much?

I don't think it was ever a gravy train.  Ports cost mana.
Mana costs time.  The druids and wizards earned their port
money.  That it was safe is meaningless.  Some tradeskills
make money and they're safe, too.  Do you want them nerfed?

Things slowed down considerably with the Nexus, and now with
PoP/PoK, I suspect the porting business will be almost at a
stand still.  You can be happy now.  How dare someone else
make a profit on a service...and a safe one at that!  Such
horrible people.

It's too bad you had such terrible, gnawing class envy before
SoL/PoP/PoK.

Well, duh.  Why would you feel bad about a nerf against a
character you've thrown away?
