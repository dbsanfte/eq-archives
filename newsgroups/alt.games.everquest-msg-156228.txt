Well, a more accurate statement was that 10 years ago, the games were
sufficiently primitive that only defective (no offense!) people could become
addicted, but now, the games are advanced enough that normal people can
become addicted. :-)

Seriously, there have always been people who get addicted to games.  Go hang
out at a weekend chess tournament, and you'll see plenty of addicts, and
that's been going on way longer than 10 years.  However, EQ does seem to be
different...I'm not sure if it is just a lot stronger in its addictiveness,
or if there is a qualitive difference.
