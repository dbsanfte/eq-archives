I am trying to increase archery skills for my 24 pally.  Up to now I was
only using arrows to pull potential kill.  And to do that one don't need
much skill to do it. So typically I shoot one arrow to pull per kill if I
used arrow at all.  But, that method doesn't take you too far with advancing
skill points.

I became interested in advancing my skills because the other day I saw one
player using archery skills in more advanced way; killing with arrows alone,
and pulling potential kill in such a way so that it couldn't call for other
creature to train us.  And that was very interesting.  Also arrows are the
only thing Melee class player has to stop the Caster class from attacking
from distance.

So I packed my quiver full of arrows, my Fletching skill is up close to 50
now, and went for target practice.  I was interested in shoot count so I
went to the area where there are lots of low level snakes and such things
running about.  I "root" the target and kill it with arrow shots.  But after
shooting over 100 arrows my skill points stayed where I started!  Can one
earn skill points by shooting lower level critters or do I need to attack
blue or black level target?
