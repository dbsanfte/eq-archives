Last time I checked, my character does not play the game without me.   If I hire
someone in game, it's still ME doing the hiring.  If I could tell my character
to go and earn some plats while I am at work, the problem would be solved.

Not exactly.  But if I had enough money, I could buy a team, and hire players.
If my team won a trophy, I guess in some sense it would be partly mine.  Plus,
in theory, hockey players get paid for their time and thus don't NEED an outside
job.   I have an outside job that helps me pay for my Everquest subscription.
If I feel like buying a few plats to make the game more fun for me, this is a
GOOD thing for Sony because it makes me play (and pay) longer.     

Or are you suggesting that Sony should restrict EQ subscriptions to only those
people with a proven talent at playing?
