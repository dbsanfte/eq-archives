    Thanks for that - I did read that part previously. Here's the part I
quoted again:

    "If he's brought in more than one target, I move to another one, "

    That's what threw me - it sounds like you're saying when he pulls more
than one, you attack an add, not his target.

    Is that not what you meant?

    Yeah, but you also seem to say when he pulls two, you tank the add. Or
you tank one of the adds when he pulls 3, etc.

    Yes that is true, if they follow that rule. However, if the MT is
assisting the puller and staying on target, everybody can assist the MT
*before* he's even got his target acquired, by assisting the puller. This
allows everybody to act earlier.
