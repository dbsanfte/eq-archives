Don't read so well, do you?  You're not forced to pay anything.  You -are-
forced to show an ability to pay.  You'll note that the billing
starts -after- the first month.  Yes, that's right, you get a month (or 30
days) to play before you're billed.  Put another way, you get a free 30
days.

Gee, I'm so sorry that you don't like their product.  I'm sure Sony's crying

your $19 Canadian goes, I don't think they want Monopoly money.
