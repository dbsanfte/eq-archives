Some people just have better luck than others.  I harvested two severed
firs the first time I went to TS.  Since I spent all my time in Nek, I
thought firs were just another common, so I destroyed them.  Since
then, I found one more.  This weekend I found a ruthenium (sp?) that
sold for 65g (the rest on the broker were 85g+, so I guess I sold it
too low), and have a feysteel that I don't know how much to charge for.

Last week, I was in a group with a guy in EF that had like six rubies
on him, four high-quality pelts, a couple opals, etc.  His list was
insane.  I asked if he looted it all and he said a couple of the rubies
and one of the opals, other than that they were all harvested.

A couple of my friends were completing Manastone recently.  One of them
harvested for days straight and didn't get her high-quality pelt.  She
ended up having to pay like 2p for one, just out of frustration.  She
did give me like 20 stacks of T4 meat though :P  Another guildie found
his on the first den he hit in EL.
