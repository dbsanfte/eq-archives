I know I've seen it many times while failing sense heading.  It's just
possible that I transferred that in my mind to believe any failure could
result in a skill increase, but the one I believe I've seen was while
attempting to cast lesser shielding.  At the time, it wasn't very reliable,
so I would have to cast 3-4 times to get it to take.  It almost never
fizzles now.  OTOH, Halo of Light is currently pretty unreliable, and I've
only seen skill increases on successes, so maybe I've just talked myself
into it.

Cheers,
Eric
