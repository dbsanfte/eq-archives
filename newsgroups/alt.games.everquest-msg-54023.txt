That's interesting, I never changed the status of the inspect message, I see
inspect messages, it would appear that seeing inspect messages is the
default state.  If, on the other hand, you meant that inspect messages are
on by default, then perhaps you should reread what Dan wrote.  Specifically,
he said that he is happy they gave him the tool which allows him to be
ignorant of the intrusions, and he turned it on (the filter which causes
inspect messages NOT to be displayed) the very first day.
