Fungi Tunic
Tolans Breastplate
Tolans Bracer
Horse
Solstice Earring      (FT1)
Dark Cloak of the Sky (50% self haste)

These are the only ones that spring to mind; the fungi tunic is
primarily useful at the 'lower' levels , up to about 60, but retains
utility forever. The BP is a great port device, with the LDON and
POP port systems it gives you insane port flexibility for free. 

Prior to getting Endless Quivver the Tolans Bracer will summon arrows
which is handy for you; once you DO get your archery AA's, the horse
gives you sitting mana regen whilst you plink away with arrows, much
like casters get their advantage while casting. This is handy for
maintaining nuke DPS at the same time, etc.

I cant read your magelo, but your epics are still worth doing - slow
is always useful to have , and the ATK on swiftwind is handy till
the end game as a piece of archery jewellery.

Weaponwise... War Marshalls bladed staff is probably the best 'cheap'
weapon off the top of my head. For real advice look at

My midgame knowledge is sadly out of date - it stopped around the time
of velious ;)

Not any more - they keys are no longer no rent, so once you've keyed
up its easy to go to. The sphere drops on the 5th island, which is the
same island that spawns the keeper of souls; the critter who drops the
core part of the dark cloak of the sky.

I've duo'd that island with another 65 ranger, but we already had our
keys to get up there. While its a bit trickier getting up there for the
first time (some islands have things that are very addy, for example),
it should be too tricky for 1 or 2 groups of decent players, dependant
on level.

It does, however, take time - the Keeper for example is a timed spawn.
