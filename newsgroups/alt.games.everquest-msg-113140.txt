Last night my level 14 enchanter did a full run from NRO to NK, and none of
the druids i asked in tunnel, at WC druid ring and the ones I passed by on
the way, would give me a sow for the long run.
A total of 6 druids were asked (polite, in /tell and in roleplay style, no
"SoW plz" style), and 3 refused, and 3 ignored. None of the druids were
engaged in battle or groups.
Unfortunatly there were no shaman around to ask, so I cannot judge if its 
a druid only thing.

I managed to survive the slow run to the NK spires without SoW, but I'm
surprised that Im not worthy the expense of 40 mana points. I know it might
add som meditation downtime (1 minute for a level 40 char) but if you are
sitting at the tunnel reading /auction, then it doesn't seems like a big
offer to me.

This incident made me embarrased to be a part of the druid class !

Anyway. If you see my druid on Antonius Bayle, I can always spare 40 mana
for the SoW. And when my chanter makes it to FV, he will find you worthy of
the 35 mana cost of Breeze for those who ask polite
