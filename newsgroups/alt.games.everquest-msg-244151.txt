He may not have had enough faction to buy them from the vendor, but
just enough not to be killed. Same for FV. It's easy to sacrifice
faction for easy EXP if you don't realize you need it until it's too
late. Maybe he was just being nice, or not paitent enough to work his
faction back up.

I'm having a good day, so I'll go with being nice. =)
