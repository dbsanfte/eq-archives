At level 28?

Would you care to explain how? You don't have a decent AE spell yet
(so no quading), your best single target nuke does @105 DD (depending
on focus items), and you only have 2 decent DoTs (Creeping Crud,
Stinging Swarm).

Let me guess....You are twinked to 200+ Wis and had KEI?

Nothing wrong with that, but hardly indicative of what the class can
do on it's own.
