I started the Crazed Gobs in Butcherblock at 29, worked them one at a time
until 34, then started quadding (well, tripling) them.  Stayed with it until
37 or so when I started getting cyans mixed in with my blues.  Then it was
on to FV for Forest Giants.

The Crazed Gobs have the advantage of being fixed spawn points far enough
apart to not aggro (no harmony needed), and they drop nice loot (I averaged
between 80 and 90 plat per bank run).  The camp is a druid's dream ... lot
of room to kite, guards close by should you get into trouble with a
resister, and zero possibility of adds from wandering mobs.

The disadvantage is that every druid out there knows this, and they're often
camped.
