    Ok everyone.  I've decided that I want to make a wizard where I can
transport and have use of spells.  I've mostly been playing a warrior.  Plus
I would like to transport to sol now and other places, without taking boat.
So, what race, etc should I go with and where should I put the points at.
Plus, anything else that you would like to add about how to make a great
wizard would be appricated.

Thanks,
Noah
