	No, because we KNOW that they didn't drop off those mobs in the past.  Geb
Twigborn's quest was well-known to be among the broken quests in the game from
day one.  It wasn't until about a year later that the Highland Lions were
added, from which the HQ Lion Skins did drop.  (And we found that, as usual,
the reward wasn't worth the trip.)

	I must have killed thousands of lions, personally, in all that time in
various parts of the world without getting HQ Lion Skins off anything but
Highland Lions.  There are thousands of tailors in the game with similar
experience, and then there's these two crackpots who say they got them
someplace else (assuming you and the guy on the website are two different
people).  If they DO drop elsewhere the probability must be so low as to be
negligible, but the vast likelyhood is that the people who say they got them
elsewhere are mistaken.

	But *lots* of people have gotten them from Highland Lions, so you'd have
to be a true loony toon to hold that position.  I only have to ignore you.
