I'm not sure this is a good thing for the *rest* of EQ. LDoN is already 
the optimal gear path for most people entering the game who don't want 
to buy plat or farm silks, but this almost makes spending time outside 
of LDoN a waste of time. =(

Up until now, you could at least get intermediate gear from drops in 
other zones, while you save your AP... but if you can spend your AP and 
then get it back when you want to upgrade whats the point of doing 
anything but get AP?

I hope at least their is an AP loss on sell back.

They really need to provide alternate ways of earning AP.. e.g. by 
handing in quest items collected from elsewhere in the game. (Still make 
people 'unlock' the ldon item by doing the various ldons.

If they go group in CoM or SolB, or EJ, or something they shouldn't get 
penalized for it.
