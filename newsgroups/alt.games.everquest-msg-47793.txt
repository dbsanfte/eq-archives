While his response may have been somewhat offensive, it's no more
offensive to me than people who insist on using whatever newsgroup they
feel like to check there newsgroup settings, instead of using alt.test,
which is where such things should be posted.  This type of test in many
other newsgroups also tend to proceed spam bombardment of the newsgroup,
which is part of why it upsets me and others to see people post test
messages elsewhere than alt.test.  It also needless eats up bandwith,
and people shouldn't have to download that kind of crap when/if reading
a newsgroup offline.
