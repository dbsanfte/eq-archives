A bit deviant from topic, but:

I'd like to see all player-made items tagged with its creator's name.  It
would be in tiny print when you inspect it, e.g. "Tailored by Dalavidu"

Why?  I don't know.  Maybe if there were differences between created items
such that similar items were of more or less quality depending on the
creator then perhaps a particular artisan's work would be more desirable
(collectible?).

Probably just pride, or something....
