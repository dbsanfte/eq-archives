As far as I know, the only thing "count" does is omit the listing of
the actual names of the players.  It's useful when your query would
otherwise return so many players that it would get cut off (e.g., "/w
all druid").  "All," of course, only means "include all zones in this
query."

I don't believe there is any way to include anons in class queries.
By design, I should imagine.

A bit OT, but I *swear* there used to be a way to get a list of
players in a zone other than the one you currently occupy.  I don't
know if they took it out or I'm hallucinating here.  Anyone remember?
