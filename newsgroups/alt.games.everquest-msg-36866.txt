At the worst you may be dubious. Just kill or loot warbraids from Sarnak
Bezerkers. Turn them in four at a time to
the undead marine Capt. Rotgrime. This is the ONLY way to raise your
faction.

I made it to amiable, bought a jade and gave it to the undead foreman to get
the workman's sledgehammer (2hb equipable by every class, at lvl 50 it procs
gate to The Overthere)
