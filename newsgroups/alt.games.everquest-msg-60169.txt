    No, I'm not talking about prom queens, although there IS a bit of that
where they shed, say, a few AC to go Ry'Gorr BP over Ravenscale/Ivy. I'm
talking about people who took the traditional outdoor XP route because
that's where the pickup groups were, who never camped an item because they
couldn't find folks to help them with it (and it ain't often you can camp
greens for solid gear pre-50), and consequently bought much of their gear in
EC with cash from incidental drops and coin loot. First characters that have
nobody to drop twink gear on them and who are learning about the game as
they level up.

    Nor would a first-gen character, until he learns more. How many of your
pre-Kunark tanks have max STA allocations? Would you call them freaking
morons because they didn't know that stats were useless? Does the existence
of EQ info sites imply that anyone who plays the game without looking for
them and reading them intently (you have to pry to get any useful info out
of some of the popular sites, and you won't know a priori what sites are
useful) is a moron?

    Last night: me (54 rogue), 57 cleric, 55ish SHM, 46 rogue, 51 SK, 59
ranger. That was our right corner group. My rogue has been in Velk's since
level 49, and has never been terribly out of place with other people's
levels on the floor. Again - that may very well be server-specific. But
that's what I'm seeing more and more of - people come at a low level and
never leave.

    I'd say we're a bit behind. From reading on FoH's site, most servers
have been in NToV a lot longer than we have, most servers either woke the
Sleeper or have been farming Ventani a lot longer than we have, and many
servers have multiple NToV-capable guilds (whereas we just got our second
guild). The top guild on our server was founded by a wizard, and in many
ways they thought like wizards. Although we had our Kunark server-wide
firsts (first WIZ epic, first killing of the Queen of Chardok), Velious was
a rough transition.

>Generally on most servers, there's only two or three top end guilds.

    The number two guild, again, has JUST started killing Tormax, and last
night was having issues against Yelinak. They were the first to bag all the
First Broods, though, and achieved this some time ago, so I imagine it's a
learning curve/attendance thing. (The top guild never bothered with Sontalak
for some reason. Which I always found odd, given how other servers' top
guilds described pretty much keying up off his one day respawn.) Only those
top two guilds have killed any Velious kings, period.
