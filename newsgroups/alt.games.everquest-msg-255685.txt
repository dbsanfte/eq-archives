Well, I beg to differ.  Waaay back in 5th grade we used to play this game 
at lunchtime, kicking the soccer ball around the field, where one person 
would be goalie, and everyone else would try to get the ball past him.  
Whoever succeeded would get to be the new goalie.

So basically, we were all solo soccer players.  Soccer can exist in the 
absence of teamwork.

EQ was a game for soloers and single groups.  It's grown to be a game for 
raiders and single groups.  Naturally, those who like to solo are feeling 
some pinch.
