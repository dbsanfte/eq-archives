I figured that it would be useless for anything else then overviewing
a scene, i have a map of Rathe Mountains and it shure looks weird,
a good spirit of the wolf would be nice to run faster, but that the
necro don't have, i do have the lvl 1 spell invisibillity to undead
but it lasts a very short period of time, or will it last longer when
i am of a higher lvl?

Maybe i will wait until lvl 12 when i can get the bind spell so i
don't have to start over again.
