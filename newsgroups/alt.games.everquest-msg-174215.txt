For every one person determinedly working the system to save themselves 
a few pounds/dollars, there are several people who buy software they 
otherwise would not have done, because they know they can return it if 
they don't like it. 90% of the time they keep it. And remember they are 
almost certainly still making a profit on that game you bought at a 
30-50% discount. Game (in the UK, I can't speak for other places) 
operate a no-questions software return policy, and their business model 
seems to be holding up quite well at present.
