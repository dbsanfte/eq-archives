In situations where I've needed to let a friend temporarily use my account,
rather than giving them the password, and then changing it when they are
done, I've changed the password *before* giving it to them to something that
will be easy for them to remember, and that has no connection with any
password generation scheme I use for my passwords.  When they are done, I
then change it back to what it was.
