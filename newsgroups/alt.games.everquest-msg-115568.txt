If you Lesser Succor by yourself I'm PRETTY sure you lose only 150 mana.  At
least, I've used it a number of times (god, I use that bugger all the time
if I need to go to BFE, and I usually do) and at 52 I think I'd notice the
200 difference per cast.  *shrug*  I could be wrong.

As for soloing, yeah, Egress is handy, but by the time you get it hopefully
you're grouping a bit more.
