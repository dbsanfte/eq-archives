First, bard is depended on their armor more than weapon, try to buy a set
bronze armor.
Second, do you max the blast instructment skill? L18 DDD song is the key for
damage. You can change horn and lute hot key, for L2 dot, L6 heal, L18 dot
song. Mob die so fast.
Third, try blues if you wanted to stay alive, or killed by few full damage
of double attack from black.

For me, I play my L18-20 at Highpass. Not easy, maybe you can try mammoth
calf at Everforst.
South Karana is for L20 or above, but there are some low avaiks. High level
likely teens kill them, so they have something blue/yellow spawns to kill.
Unrest will be ok for you, many blue/yellow for you level.
The orc highway and croc in Oasis also good, but I hate oasis. Too many
stupid stay there.

After I come to L20, there is two place. Avaik guards at Lake Rathe, and the
gargorlye at OoT. Avaik is always camped, u can find a partner or group
easily. Gargorlye is share spawn with greater skelly, just fit for solo, but
you can only bind at Freeport. Have to spend a long time to recover corpse.
