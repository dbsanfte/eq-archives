Star Wars is more "pop" Sci-fi.  The good guys always win.  (even if one of
them gets his hand cut off)  And I don't personally consider Ep 1 to count,
it was unmitigated crap (*cough*JarJar&Anakin*cough*) with a bit of
backstory to it, and a couple nice fight scenes, still prefer The Matrix
though.

Bladerunner is more of a "noir" Sci-fi.  And don't say anything about the
original cut with the crappy happy ending scene, the directors cut and the
fade to black are the real way to watch it.  And you never really can tell
if Decker is a replicant or not...

Now which one is Joe Moron more likely to go see?   Or the critics to review
favorably?
