I guess it depends.  I can crit nuke for about 4k, and my frequency
seems to be about one crit nuke per 2 fights.  Otherwise I'm hitting
for about 1800 to 2k per shot.  If the tank doesn't require fast heals
or chain CH's I can drop about 3-4 nuke per mob.  Of course mana runs
out eventually but with Clairvoyance and a bard I'm usually good at
that pace for 3 to 4 mobs till I have to slow back down.

The stun can be significant if you're dealing with a CH or gate mob.
Otherwise you are correct, long recast time (once per fight is usual,
occasionaly twice).

The hammer can vary much so I can only speak for me.  I hit for
minimal normal damage.  Anywhere from 16 to 60 (about my max).  But it
proc's for 155 about every 2 to 3 swings, and drop in my nuke aa's and
I can crit proc for 400.  It may still only be 2k during a fight but
it's something different.  If I'm going strictly for DPS I'm better
off nuking.

However, as I've been working on defensive aa's I find I can offtank
fairly well.  Not tank-class well but better than most chain and
leather melee classes.
