All,

Hopefully I'm not bugging anyone yet, but I have a few questions. First,
killing snakes and beetles is getting quite monotonous. I realize I am
young, but is there anything better I can do with my time to gain exp, fact,
money, etc at lvl3-4? Also, last night in MT I was attacked (as I see it) by
a black wolf and after getting SOWed (among other spells) I killed the wolf
and the guy that SOWed me was pissed. I assume he was a druid, but what did
he really expect? To be perfectly honest, I thought my whole goal in life at
this level was to go to MT and kill everything in sight and loot. Guess I
learned.

Anyway, all advice for a lvl3 Halfling Rogue is appreciated and thanks to
all in this ng for all the help.

Phinehas
Halfling Rogue III...and dinging nightly :)
