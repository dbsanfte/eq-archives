I'm not really sure what level it starts at, if it isn't at level one.  I do
know that when the introduced it my wizard was level 20 and he started
critting right away.  He actually USED to do it on a fairly regular basis.
I think they have nerfed the rate at which you will get crits though, cause
I haven't had one in about a month.  I used to get the several time per
session.
