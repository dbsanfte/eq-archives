Yes I saw that, and can't believe they'd promote something like that.  I
really think more of it is based on knowledge and personal experience.  Pet
psychic I'd think is closer to a doctor than psychic.  I think I'll record
tomorrow's show and watch it when I get home (Tivo, and thats only if my
computer has enough hard drive space) just to see how much doctor is in
there rather than psychic.
