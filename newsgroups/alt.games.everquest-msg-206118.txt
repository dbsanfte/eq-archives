>   INEXPERIENCED CHILI TASTER

>   Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Tester Named FRANK, who had moved
> to
>   Texas from the East Coast:
>   "Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili
> cook-off.
>  The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened
> to be
>  standing there at the
>   judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon,when the call
> came.
>  I was assured by the two judges (Native Texans) that the chili
> wouldn't be
>  all that spicy and besides, they told me I could have free beer during
> the
>   tasting, So I accepted."
>
>   Here are the scorecards from the event:
>
>  CHILI # 1: MIKE'S MANIAC MOBSTER MONSTER CHILI
>
>   JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato.
>   Amusing kick.
>
>   JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor.
>   Very mild.
>
>   FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff?
>   You could remove dried paint from your driveway.
>   Took me two beers to put the flames out.
>   I hope that's the worst one.

> >  to   be taken seriously.
> >
> >  FRANK: Keep this out of the reach of children.
> >  I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides
> >  pain.  I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me
> >  the Heimlich  maneuver.  They had to rush in more beer when
> >  they saw the look on my face.

> >  My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano.
> >  Everyone knows the routine by now-get me more beer

> >
> >  JUDGE ONE:
> >  A mediocre chili with too much reliance on   canned peppers.
