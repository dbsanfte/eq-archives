Now *that* is incorrect.  He actually did have an exit strategy and a plan
to oust Sadaam.  Whether it would have been a viable strategy or not is
anybody's guess, it obviously never got tried.

Also incorrect, though I've seen it tossed around a few times.  Nothing Bush
Sr. or his cabinet ever said indicated this.

In fact, it did.  The UN was up in arms (figuratively, of course...  it is
the UN after all) about the war, in spite of the fact that we were merely
honoring an agreement with a friendly country.  They started bitching even
more as the troops approached Baghdad, with their main argument being that
we had already accomplished our stated purpose for the war, driving Iraq out
of Kuwait and preventing the likelihood that they would try again anytime
soon.  Bush Sr. gave into the pressure, both from the UN and from at home
from those who agreed with the UN, with the promise from the UN that there
would be sanctions imposed and enforced.  It was probably the biggest
failure of his presidency.

We're talking about "republicans doing whatever the UN wants" right now, so
stop trying to change the subject.  =P

They'd been allowed 6 or 12 months multiple times.  The question that should
really be asked is why they didn't cooperate fully with the sanctions if
they *didn't* have anything to hide.  There is a possible answer to that
question that doesn't involve their having "WMDs" by the way, before you
call that a conspiracy theory.  =)

Would you rather invade Iran?  With a military that *hadn't* been partially
pounded a decade before?  With a ruling power that *wasn't* universally
despised?  I can't see that as being any better, and can see the definite
possibility for it to be worse.

Would you rather invade Korea?  The country can field a standing army of 3
million people, and that's before the Chinese start pouring in to add to the
crush of bodies.  Talk about a bloodbath.  Oh, and we can't piss China off
too much, cause China *does* have nukes, and the missile technology to drop
them on our heads, without fear of repercussion from any other country. 

Yeah, it might start WW3...  and after every country loses 90% of its
population, China assumes its place as ruler of the world with as many
people left as the US started with.  How's that for a conspiracy theory? =)

It's the only thing on that page you linked that wasn't a statistic.  All
presidents have statistics, some *might* even have some relation to who is
president, but that doesn't quite rise to the standard of an
"accomplishment" even if you somehow manage to make a concrete connection to
the president at the time.  Rubin had far more to do with the economy than
Clinton did.  Greenspan would be next in line.

So you're an Antichristian?  I'd have to venture an assumption about your
parents at this point, but it would just lead to a conversation that would
never have substance.  =)
