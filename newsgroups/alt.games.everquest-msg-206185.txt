Last one I saw was the Halloween event last year. Most of it was scripted
pops (werewolves and such in WC), but there was a GM or two dropping
illusions on folks (werewolves, imps, jack-o-lanterns and such). It was
largely mid-bee stuff that was dropped by the special mobs. The bummer was
that it was largely high toons that were getting all the kills (apparently,
there had been some better drops the year before)

There were some rumors of some interesting pops around Christmas too, but I
don't recall any details, and I think they were of the spot variety (some GM
amusing themselves).

About a year ago, there was a race of some sort in GFay. I believe the prize
was a 100% weight reduc bag. It involved you creating a lvl 1 toon and
finding something (might have even been the GM) in zone. They all got lined
up on one side, and then were sent to do something. I considered doing it,
but the zone was lagging out BAD (later heard there was something like 176
in zone - not the bazaar, but still a LOT of toons in one place).

So, they've been rare, but they do still exist.

Oh, and I can tell you that Povar still definitely has people around. A lot
of the previously overcrowded zones are way down in population, but, when I
look around, I think as much of that is people spreading out after the xp
changes as anything else. Sebilis and Velks are just a couple of the zones
that suddenly have folks in them again. Seb is still not a whole lot of fun
to try and get a pickup group in, but at least it's not empty anymore, and
it often has 3-4 groups working. I haven't been to Velks in a while, but I
can tell from what I see for sale in the bazaar that a lot of people are
going there again. Veksar often has 4-6 non-raid groups working.
