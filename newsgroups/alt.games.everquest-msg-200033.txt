Much truth here.  It's all about where and what you hunt at this point.  At 
level 5 you might try the East Commons, Qeynos Hills, or find some higher 
level things to kill in the zone right outside of your starting city.  Once 
you get to level 10 or so you can head to Crushbone and kill stuff there 
(unless you're a dark elf, since it'll screw up your faction a bit).  Once 
you get to 14 or 15 you can head to Paludal Caverns and absolutely rake in 
the XP until you're in your mid-20s.  Even with 2 hours at a time, you 
should be up into the 20s before long :)

Wandering around at that level you are more than likely going to get your 
ass handed to you rather quickly, especially if you're unfamiliar with 
factions and such.  Your race and diety are going to determine for the most 
part where you can go safely.

As a warrior, you have no way of effectively healing yourself, so you're 
going to want to find a healer to team up with.  That alone will open up a 
lot more places for you to go and make the xp come in much faster.

There's 60 more levels of content ahead of you, I wouldn't start exploring 
in earnest until you've gone through about 20 more of 'em and have an idea 
for the game mechanics ;)
