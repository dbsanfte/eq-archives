i know everyone is going to weigh in on this, but the side-effects of haste 
buffs do stack when you see them in your window - that is, if you have a 
bard song plus some enchanter haste buff (a shaman's haste is always only 
pure haste - no side effects like stat boosts), you may do more DPS from 
having the atk/str/whatever boost along with the second haste (even though 
the actual haste isn't bolstered by the pretty-much-wasted buff slot)
