The 10 commandments merely codify morality. The implied punishment and 
reward not withstanding. Even the bible doesn't say "'Thou shalt not 
kill' is 'good' because God says so". Or more generally the bible 
doesn't suggest that God 'chose' what is moral in some arbitrary way. 
That which is moral is moral independant of God... in other words: if a 
Christian was suddenly confronted with irrefutable proof that there was 
no God, and he beleived it... it would not release him from morality. He 
would still beleive it was wrong to kill.

Similiarly atheists beleive it is wrong to kill, and they have no divine 
intervener telling them so.

Yes. Although the motivation wasn't particularly.

No different.

Subtle distinction.

And this what most Christians would tell you too. They're choices are an 
attempt to live according to God's will because that is the right thing 
to do, punishment for failure notwithstanding.

No. Then 'good' aetheists are the most moral people. I disagree with that.

I think Dogma illustrates the point pretty well. Its far more important 
that you try to be good within the framework of what you beleive, then 
it is to beleive in the right framework. God is looking for people to 
'lead good lives'... but theres more than one road 
(religion/philosphy)... and he doesn't really care what road you take.

You make it sound like religion inherently lessens your morality.. this 
is simply untrue.

True, there is an aspect to organized religion that suggests 
each-to-its-own that they are the one-true-path...but few reasonable 
people really beleive that; its mostly an artifact of the organization 
not the individuals.

That a young child born to a tribe where 'Christianity' (for example) 
hasn't reached yet, who dies at 4 years of age, would be condemned to a 
fiery hell for eternity simply because of the misfortune of being born 
in the wrong part of the world doesn't sit well with most religious people.
