It's way past time for level restricted items.  All the 
new mage summoned focus items are level resticted this
way (I gave a top tier focus earring to a 34 wiz, and
it only gave him +15hp/mana instead of 20).  This in and
of itself will address the growing imbalance between 
(essentially) untwinkable casters and melee at the lower
levels.
