If one wants to get technical, the name of the first game is 
'EverQuest', not 'EverQuest 1' or 'EverQuest I' or 'EverQuest Live' (now 
a truely meaningless term since they are both 'live'). Therefore a 
newsgroup for .everquest is (at the least) for the first game.

But otoh we tolerated the (admittedly very small amount of) EverQuest 
Online Adventures traffic here without too much complaint.

I think we can be all encompassing. That we can bridge the gap, and heal 
the wounds left over from the bitter partisan infighting that has gone 
before us. To look ahead, not behind, to harmony between the players of 
Everquest, no matter their race, class, server, platform, or revision 
number... that we can..

sorry, got carried away there.
