One thing to note though is that BA now works the way ID does -
IE an average of 10% (0-20%).  This opens the way for other BA
type items with greater percentages on DoT's in general, or 
on a specific type of dot (such as Poison, Disease, or Magic),
much like those that exist for nukes.

It also opens the way for a BA type spell for various types of
dots along the lines of the ID spell for Ice/Fire nukes that
wizards get and the songs that bards get.
