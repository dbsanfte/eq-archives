From my enchanter experience, the sole purpose I have found for research 
is to do combines for low level players of the same class so that they 
too can have the spells.  :b

I think that your success rate has just been bad, as was mine.  I gave 
up, and asked a high level enchanter to do my combines for me for 
precisely that reason.
