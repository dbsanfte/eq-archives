Ahem. I happen to be a socialist, and I happen to agree with your position 
in this debate, so that doesn't really mean much. In the face of it, neither 
of the factions in the middle-east conflict are exactly "liberal".

As for the marketplace keeping any media outlets unbiased, that doesn't work 
that way. All the marketplace can do is to keep a media outlet *popular*, 
and all this has to do with is its *perceived* biases, rather than its real 
biases. If the country's mood swings to the right, right-wing outlets will 
carry more weight, and if it swings to the left, that will happen with more 
leftist media. It's only logical.

"Unbiased" is entirely in the eye of the beholder. What is unbiased to you, 
for me it's blatantly right-wing, and what would appear as unbiased to me, 
it would probably sound blatantly liberal to you.
