What I do know is that
I find myself compelled to log in every night and play, play, play, because
my wife and I are having a great time. We are both level 17 with our current
Heroes (we re-rolled after taking previous Heroes to 20) and mostly duo
together, roaming the streets in seach of bad guys to kill and missions for
our contacts. We played a mission last night that introduced us to a new map
I'd never seen. We were winding our way through this deep, three-story
office complex, taking elevators to three separate fighting areas, twisting
and turning around corners and ambushes that kept us white-knuckled
throughout. We had to save 7 hostages and free them, and this required
locating them hidden away in all kinds of odd places and taking out the
guards (some of whom were wired with self-explosives). It was outrageously
fun and required all of our best tactics to stay alive. As a Controller and
Defender, we don't have a lot of damage dealing to our credit, and we were
fighting the Tsoo, probably the most difficult mobs to fight at our level,
and the battles were furious and fun. We failed the mission with 1 hostage
to go :( but wow, what a fun experience. In the end, we didn't feel cheated,
we felt disappointed! We let our contact down. :(  Tonight we go back and
take on the next mission from this contact and hopefully will redeem
ourselves.
