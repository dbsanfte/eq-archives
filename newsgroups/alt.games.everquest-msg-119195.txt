No - I do none of the above, I just report/page.

You seem to have some built up anger there for some reason - been on the
wrong end of a few reports have we? Well - there is a easy solution for not
getting reported, and that is to stop being an asshole.

As to the number of incidents required - yes it is one. I am no-ones
babysitter. In just under 3 years I have had reason to report/page about a
dozen times.
