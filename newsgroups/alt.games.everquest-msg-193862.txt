Wow, news to me. Looks like MS wants to cash in now that it isn't
selling XBoxes for them anymore. When the XBox launched Halo was the
"must have" game, and really the only reason to buy the system at the
time. 

Halo should have been out for the PC before the XBox was released
(nearly 2 years ago now). It was shown at E3 something like 2.5-3
years ago.

Great news to hear it will be on the PC. Glad I was wrong :)
