Shame on you then for acting like a spoiled child.

I don't "fully support" outages. I hate server downtime as much as
anyone, but I don't over-react and throw a hissy fit when it happens.
I accept the fact that such outages are unavoidable if the game is
going to improve. You obviously have no clue as to what is required to
service and maintain the staggering number of EQ servers that Verant
is responsible for. Cutting VI some slack isn't ass kisses, it's
common sense.

So you inflicted downtime on your customers and none of them quit? Did
any of them bitch like a 2-year old when you had scheduled or
unscheduled downtime? I don't see masses of EQ players quitting
because of patch days, but the whiners come out like roaches.
