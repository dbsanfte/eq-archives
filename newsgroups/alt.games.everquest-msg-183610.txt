... I'm masochistically anal?  Lizards are starting to like me.  And I 
got two factions in Qeynos to luv me lots the other night.  Of course 
I'm mildly pissing off COUH doing the gnoll teeth quests, but eh - I'll 
pacify them later.  I think mass slaughtering of bandits does it (now

Yeah yeah yeah.  Whatever.  Still, point being I need the damn faction 
anyway, so why not.
