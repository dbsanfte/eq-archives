I had a nightmare recently with my EQ.... Here's the deal:
I had changed my CPU to a faster one..
Upgraded my RAM (oh, btw, Windows ME doesn't handle more than 512megs.. did
you know this?)
Reinstalled Windows
Reinstalled 23.11 Drivers for Vid Card (most recent)
Reinstalled DX 8.1
Reinstalled Trilogy & Luclin - took over 10 hours on 56K

Game crashed after I selected server.. it would load equipment, then go back
to connecting to login.  Turns out my WIN MODEM was the culprit - even
though it worked fine before... with DX8.1 and the win modem.

Ok, Win modems use CPU for functions... turns out DX8.1 does as well.. so,
byebye interent connection when DX8.1 kicks in. - Can confirm this by
running DXDiag and running DX8.1 Test on Video screen.  Modem connection
stays active, but internet is disabled and can't browse.

To fix this, I had to move my physical cards around a bit so that the modem
had a different IRQ and also so that the Sound and Video cards were not
sharing with anything else.

Just wanted to share this in case you have a problem similar to this. - The
best solution is probably for me to just get a hardware modem. - But - it's
working so I'm happy. :)
