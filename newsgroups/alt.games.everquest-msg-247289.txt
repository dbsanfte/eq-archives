Doesn't bother me, and didn't hurt my immersion.

Not quite sure what you're getting at with this one.  Don't think you

Again, disagree.  PoK was a bit overboard, but on the whole there are much
worse things wrong with the game.

The two biggest problems as I saw it.

1) Overuse of keyed / flagged zones.  There should never be expansions with
the entire content restricted to very few players.  The game gets its
strength from player interaction, yet they did thier best to stratifiy the
players so they could only interact with the small groups that were at the
same place in the "progression."  The idea is to draw the players together,
not introduce artificial barriers between them.

2) Complete surrender to Munchkinism.  They destroyed old content by
trivializing it with higher levels than it was designed for, and where
levels weren't added they threw in gear that was so unbalanced that once you
got it, everything backwards was trivial.  Every expansion they apparently
felt they needed to make the loot "jaw dropping" over the previous
expansion's best to entice players to go after it.   The massive mudflation
destroyed any semblence of balance that remained.
