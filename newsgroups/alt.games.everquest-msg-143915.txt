This is all I ever wished they had done to Conquest, as opposed to the
stripping of their guild tag.

Verant hasn't dissolved the guild, although the master of cliche that writes
for their web page seems to think they are done with EQ anyway.  My bet is
that that will last 7 to 10 days, depending on how long the majority of
those suspensions winds up being.

What I thought was funny was how, immediately after these folks were caught,
they realized, ". . . shit is rotten to the core in Norrath and San Diego -
any dev/designer worth a damn jumped ship long ago, class balance is a joke,
itemization is full-on Monty Hall, zones are buggy, encounters are busted
and if SoV was a rushed delivery expansion, then SoL is a full on abortion .
. ."  Although there is a modicum of truth in this quote, LoS's making it
just after they were caught cheating in the very same expansion they revile
the most shows this guild's complaint for what it is:  a liberal mixture of
sour grapes and hypocrisy.

Good riddance to Legacy of Steel if they do indeed quit.  I'm sure the
guilds under them will be grateful for the greater opportunity to excel in
this game.  I just hope they will carry with them the lessons LoS has helped
Verant to affirm -- no guild is bigger than the game (or in some cases,
games) they play in.

You break the rules of EQ, you bear the consequences.  Or, as Legacy of
Steel has threatened to do, you can go beta test a sad mockery of it.
