Man, you ARE looking for a fight today Lok.  =)

I've petitioned my share of idiot names in my day, and I've let a lot
that made me groan slide.  One thing I've learned is to just let it go

/ooc Heh, I wonder how long it will take Poopypants to get a GM
enforced name change! 

Often times the Kodak moments that brings out cn be priceless, or
droll depending how many other kewlios are about.
