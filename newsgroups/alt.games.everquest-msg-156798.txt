Well until the 'Guaranteed Way to Promote Grouping' includes aptitude and
co-ordination tests to weed out the completely incompetent I would say it is
better to leave a few sandpits for the clusterfucks like myself to play in.

Face it - would you like someone like me in your group?

BTW - the only thing I find funnier than the monk nerfs are the bitter monks
screaming for everyone else to be nerfed.

Would you like some Anusol? I have heard it is useful for soothing the pain
you must feel in your torn sphincter from having being sodomised repeatedly
by the Thorny Bat of Nerfdom? On the positive side I bet your mother is glad
that your head is already in close proximity to your own ass it means you
can kiss it better yourself...

Oh, by the way, Have a Nice Day!
