Yep...the lil' druid twink is now broke, and the main is broke too. Where
would you all suggest a 34 druid go for some plat loot? Other loot is okay
too, but plat is the easiest thing for spell buying. I have 5 lvls to go
before I need a few hundred for spells (maybe more, dunno). I have all
expansions. Any ideas?

tia. :)
