Watch the vendors for the words you need for your researched spells
coming up. The Words of Detachment are hard to find, and they are for
the RESEARCH ONLY 24th level Pet spell. In the Bazaar, they are cheap
at 200pp.

You want INT and STA if items have HP or MANA that helps. You have to
realize, HP==MANA.

If your pet is way blue, go petless. Petless kiting is great and I
often dont send in my pet until the mob is kited down to 50%. The mob
continues to chase me, and leave pet alone. To kite, cast a darkness,
then any dots you have at a distance. Keep moving unless you are
casting, send in pet. When the mob is way down I will cast my Mana
conversion (like allure). When it is dead, I loot and med.
