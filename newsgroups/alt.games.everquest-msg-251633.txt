MoK, thats it.

Its presented as the negative DS... but if you use it for anything but 
PLing, it has almost no usefulness in that regard.

Clocking in at what, a mighty 6 point heal per hit?  If thats accurate, 
you'll have to hit your target 50 times to make up for getting hit ONCE 
by a mob that does 300 per hit.  Meantime the mob has probably hit you 
at least 25 times...

But the overwriting of other DS, thats a much bigger deal, because most 
of those "other DS's" are a lot bigger than the heal the MOK does.

Even then, there are other means of removing those DS's.  The thing is, 
those other means are brute force cancel magic line spells, and in order 
to get to the DS you often have to remove (or have other casters delay 
casting) useful debuffs your group has put on the mob.

MOK is a precise surgical tool.  It always gets the DS, and never ever 
touches any of your buddies' debuffs.  I'd use it just as much if it 
didn't have any heal component at all.
