Er, hughes, I think we're talking about the real world here.

It may not be a terribly wise course of action, since there are hundreds 
of thousands, perhaps millions of Moslems who are, in fact, US citizens.

If you want to have a chance of stopping further occurences like 9/11, a 
better course of action would be for the CIA and other intelligence 
agencies to recruit at least a few people who can speak Arabic and start 
infiltrating those groups. Stirring the pot further by invading an 
already defeated Islamic country will actually *decrease* US safety, at 
least in the short term. The US would do a lot better trying to close 
the enormous foreign intelligence gap that it has allowed to grow since 
the end of the Cold War. If the CIA and the NSA grabbed about half of 
the Pentagon's budget, there would probably never be a second 9/11.
