We had a couple decent, but not great items drop.  Went in with just me 
for healing a group of melee types, added a mage when we got there.  It 
was fun, we did have one death inside, when the warrior who was pulling 
got an overpull, and took one for the team.  A cleric friend of mine was 
in zone, and nearby, so we got him rezzed.

The lava inside was doing about 70/tick to me without my resist gear on.
