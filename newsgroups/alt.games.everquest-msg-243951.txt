I personally wish the PoK didn't exist. But that's another story.

I'll grant I haven't used all of them yet.

My bard & druid both use the one in North Qeynos which between bard 
speed or sow, and being in the same zone as the pok book is where the 26 
second claim comes from. But I'm more than aware that for others it is 
longer, and I'm aware that few tribute masters are in the same zone as 
the pok book... most require at least one extra zone.

But we agree its only a few minutes and not that bad (ie we're not 
taking boats or waiting for spires here)... so this needs no further 
discussion.

If you read my posts again you'll see that I agree that its implemented 
badly. Fixxing it would probably entail something like what you 
describe... I've suggested previously in this ng something much like 
what you describe... to prevent any value or need to pause-resume buffs.

You'd still have to go home to pay them from time to time.

People will bitch about it and not use it at all if it is one iota less 
convenient than it could be. Its a wonder these same people don't whine 
that mobs don't simply keel over dead and leave lots of cash and rare 
loot whenever they pull them. :)

That said the nerf and "bug fix" to tribute values just after the GoD 
release has soured the tribute system for a lot of people, to some 
extent justifiably. Nobody thinks you should have gotten millions of 
tribute from 3cp fishing bait... but there were a lot of items worth 
quadruple or more what they are worth now... that were never in need of 
adjustment... imho at least.

It stacks with FT items up to the FT cap. So if you are an uber endgame 
player with FT15 in items there isn't much point. But otherwise tribute 
is a convenient and affordable way to get some FT.

My aforementioned bard has a solstice ring and pays for FT2. That gives 
me enough regen to charm pretty much as much as I want.

Also, *do not pay for tribute with pp*... particularly as a lowbie. 
There are plenty of junk items that are worth far more tribute than 
plat. When something junky drops consider its value for tribute, if you 
can't sell it to a player, and a merchant will pay you a few pp tops... 
you might be pleasantly surprised that its worth 50 or 100 tribute points...
