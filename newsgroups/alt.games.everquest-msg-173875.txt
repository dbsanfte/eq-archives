Same is true for BDs, it is not trivial at 250 with either Platinum or
Velium.  The list of trivials has always been identical for all gems for
Platinum and Velium.  Every list I have ever seen.  As far as the 5 percent
mod, that will not tell you if it is trivial with the bonus anyway, the only
time you will get a trivial message is if your raw skill level is at or
above the trivial level, and you get a successful combine.
