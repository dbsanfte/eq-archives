It wasn't the whole guild, which, after all, is 700 toons.  Or about 200 
mains.  It was a core of 4, plus 3 or 4 buffers, plus about 9 unflagged 
people.  While I've been in guilds that small, this one isn't it.  There 
were over 30 guildies online at the time, most weren't involved in the 
POJ thing at all.

Now I dont' really see any reason why they couldn't have done one of the 
other trials after success in Execution, which would have turned a once 
per 45 minutes thing into a once per 15 minutes thing, and easily 
flagged all 9 unflagged in the time they took to flag 4.

But my real objection is that while the core of 4 did indeed have to 
commit to the 90 minutes, the 4 buffers could have been out of there in 
45 (buff the group going in, and then wait about and buff the second 
group going in), and of the 9 petitioners, 2 could be done in 15 
minutes, and two more in 45 minutes, and the remaining 5 could have been 
told "not today, try again next time" at the beginning, instead of 
cooling our heels for 90 minutes only to find out at that point that the 
runs were over.

Or the buffing squad and petitioners could have been down clearing the 
way to Mavuin, which is a fairly decent camp for both exp and loot, 
making useful progress during the down time, and making the preflagging 
and flagging of people simple.

The guild seems to be about half 65, which means if everyone logged on 
their mains they could field 100+ 65s.  The family nature of the guild 
means it turns out to be more like 25 65s and a like number in the 55-65 
range... but then again, many of the lower level folks are alts of 65s.

And you have to remember, the 55-65 people are actively playing those 
characters and leveling up; by the time they get BOT flag and TT flag 
and CODe flag and so on, they may well be 65.

While its possible to level up to 65 and then go do all the flagging, 
POP was really designed with doing the flags at lower levels in mind; 
before the "you get into the tier free" plan you'd find it incredibly 
difficult to get to 65 without doing at least POJ trial.

Further, when you look at the number of two boxers and high level alt 
players in the guild, you'll realize that some of the people are trying 
to get a level 50 alt flagged so they can get him in to POV where they 
can PL him more quickly.  Again, this isn't a toon thats going to be 
spending a lot of time in his 50s.

I agree, I just don't think flagging in general is a  waste of time.  I 
do however think that the way this was done did waste quite a lot of 
time for the majority of participants.
