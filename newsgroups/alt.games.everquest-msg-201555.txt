He chose to be incompetant because it served his end at the time - it drug 
tons and tons of people to his site, most of them being the kinds of morons 
you hate in EQ.  The kinds of idiots that need to be a fan-boy to someone 
so they choose Furor because he's cool because he uses 3 curse words per 
sentence.

Now that he's trying to gain more and more favour from Blizzard ( creators 
of WoW - World of Warcraft ), he has changed his tone of his posts to not 
be so abrasive.
