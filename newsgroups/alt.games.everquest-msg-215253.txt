For at least one of the drops, there are mobs with the same name in two 
different areas, the lower level ones, that will be green to you, vs. the 
higher level ones of the same name that will be dark blue to you.  My 
understanding, and my experience was that only the higher level ones drop  
whichever part it is.  I need to look up the quest to be be sure what the 
name of the mob was, but, there is a room with a stage in it with I think 
Initiates that are mostly green, vs. an area elsewhere in the zone with 
higher level initiates.

Some of the drops are rare, but, the only one that took me a real long 
time to get was the stupud Gunthak Gulf Water, which, you, as a druid, 
can get by foraging.
