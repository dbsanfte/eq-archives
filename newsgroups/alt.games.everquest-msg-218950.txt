This is where I got bogged down in that other thread.  I was
assuming everyone could agree on this point, which turns out to
be more interesting than I thought at the time, and had a second
point to make.

Assuming that which of these strategies you use has no impact on
mobs killed per hour, it seems to me self evident that its better
to adopt a strategy which keeps your mana above 50M at all
times.  In the end, running from 98M down to 50M and back up to
80M and back down to 50M will still result in you spending the
same amount of mana per hour as one that has you running down to
20M and back to 90M, or running from 20M to 50M and back; and
both will use the same mana per hour as one that has you sitting
constantly within 5M of 80M, or of 50M, or of 20M.  All other
factors being equal (and there are of course lots of other
factors as I point out in the post I started this thread with),
mana use will be the same in the long run any way you stack it.

BUT there's something interesting to where your average or your
minimum normal operating mana level sits: emergencies.  A group
that has 80M sitting there "in the bank" is much more prepared
for a rainy day than one that has only 20M.  If both kill the
same number of mobs in the same amount of time, the group who's
strategy involves keeping a higher mana level available for
emergency use is better off.

The opposite of this arguement is that sometimes the kill rate
falls off so steeply that you end up generating more mana than
you can use; if this goes on long then the group thats sitting at
80M has only 20M of medding to do before capping out, while the
group sitting at 20M is ready to gain a full 80M of medding in
the unavoidable down time.

To me, Dead is worse than FM, but I suppose you'd have to factor
in the odds of each occuring in the situation you find yourself
in.

One corrallary is that if an unavoidable down time IS approaching
(say the only Tank in the group announces "I have to take a bio
break after this next pull guys") then its time to pull out the
stops and blow thru mana fast, that way you'll kill that next
pull off faster, the med break will happen sooner and so be over
sooner, and while its happening you'll be lower on mana so you'll
have further to go before FM.

As a mage, I tend to drop about one nuke per mob, maintaining 80%
mana level more or less constantly, assured that A) I'm doing the
same DPS I would if I dropped three nukes on the mob and then had
to sit out the next two and B) I'm ready with 80% mana if
something NEEDS KILLING NOW, which happens from time to time. 
But if the cleric (or frankly just as often, the SK puller/MT)
announces "OK med break after this next one" then I throw
everything I can in at it that won't put me over the aggro line;
use em or lose em, as they say.
