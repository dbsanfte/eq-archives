<18kills@JPF.org> Joseph Paul Franklin's bottom made this noise:
> Who should the sniper target next?

<Snip>

In other news, an individual refering to himself as 'Joseph Paul Franklin'
cross-posted to various groups on Usenet tody, causing uproar amongst a
vocal few, and probably a silent majority.

In his post, '--=Sniper Poll Questions=--', he asked questions such as 'Who
should the sniper target next?' and 'What should the snipers slogan be?'

Independant authorities state that the comments *could* have been taken
humourously, if a significant amount of time had be left to pass... But
because this was done while the sniper was still at large, and because of
the newsgroups chosen to post too, most people rightly found it highly
offensive.

Police profiles state the perpetrator is probably a male in their early
teens, as apparently only people who fit this age group would ever post
anything offensive to a group, and adults are without exception always
sensible, considerate and pleasant.

This reporter urges anyone who has solid information on the poster, not to
bother telling me.

This is Adrian Wood, at the scene of the post, back to you.
