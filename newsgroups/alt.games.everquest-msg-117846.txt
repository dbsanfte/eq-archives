There's a huge difference between PLing to 50+ in 5 days played and
reaching 60 in 50 days played. I feel sorry for *you* if you think
that someone who doesn't do things slowly isn't really enjoying the
game. What works for you doesn't work for everyone, and personally, I
*hate* sitting idle when I am playing.

Oh, and I know several towns like the back of my hand, including my
home town of Kelethin, ramps and all.
