That is, after you get up. If you stay down, the mob stays off you, so if 
you have to feign off a bad fight and you've dotted the meanie, either /q 
while FD or wait for all your dots to wear off.

35.

Mobs have a chance to remember you based on their level versus yours, 
although FD *always* memwipes a mob under level 35. Mobs have an increased 
chance to forget you if they return to their spawn point. You can use this 
to your advantage- split mobs fairly close to the spawn and you have a 
better chance of just having one when you stand. 

Also, any damage spell that is in mid-cast while you feign will cause your 
feign to break, as well AOE spells. Heals and buffs or debuffs that don't 
do damage are safe.

Also, when pulling, train your healers to only heal you after you hit the 
ground. That way, they get no healing aggro.
