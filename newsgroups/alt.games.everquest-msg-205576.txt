level.

If Neverwinter and Diablo II are your cup of tea, I'm not sure SWG will be
the 'right thing' for you. I don't know anything about the gameplay of
Morrowwind.
I will say that I really enjoy SWG. I will also say that I found Diablo II
to be really cool for the first half, only ground through it to see the
ending sequence, and only got the expansion because someone gave it to me. I
never finished Neverwinter nights.

Personally, I think if I really liked d2 and nwn, I'd probably prefer EQ
over SWG. Though EQ is not as pretty. At any rate I'd wait a week for the
initial congestion to settle down in SWG.
