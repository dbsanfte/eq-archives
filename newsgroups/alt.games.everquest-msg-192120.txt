Dont forget the real fun ones:

Some changed keyset on some keyboards (a few german guildies had this problem), where Z and Y is switched. And no, it dont bother anyone to spend 3 hours logging in because Z and Y is switched and you cant see it.

Oh, and then fun one with NPCs charming. Guild killed Lcae Katta and Nathyn Illuminous tonight, both can charm. AFter charm people cant attack or cast spells, have to camp out to fix it. REALLY fun to have 8 people camp out in middle of a fight to be able to fight again.
