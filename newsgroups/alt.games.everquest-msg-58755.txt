I have just set up a non-anime forum. I'm trying to make it into a
community for all gamers to come and she thoughts/hints/experiences
etc. Most gamers play more then one game, and it's kinda hard going to
different sites each time you wanna visit a forum for whatever game. I
don't know if this can take off, but I think it will. Come, visit,
tell me what you think. I'll need some moderators too...
