Look Bizbee, you called me a fuckface without provocation. I never said
anything or posted anything about you. You are a bi, fat 10 sandwich eating,
gas bag. I'd love to say it to your face. I am about a decade older then you
think I am and don't sit around posting much. Why you thought it was
necessary to even show your ugly ass in this thread is beyond me, but I
could care less. You can kiss my entire ass. Good day sir!
