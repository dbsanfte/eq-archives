Ok here is where we hear from every flavor of game nazi there is...

Plat Nazi 

No-Drop Nazi 

Bazaar Nazi

KEI Naziz

Content Nazi

Grouping Nazi

Solo Nazi - Very rare 

/em sighs...
So many people telling you how to enjoy your game and why you are
doing it wrong heh.

My personal favorite?

Once something is in the game leave it the hell alone, no nerfs no
when no how. Get it right the first time. But thats too much to
ask...from the developer nazis.
