Harmtouch can make up for a lot of the difference.  I'm sure SKs are fairly
popular on Discord.  Not that LoH isn't useful...  but I don't really think
it makes up for the hp margin that warriors will have at the earliest
levels.  A lot of deaths on Discord will be one-shot kills probably, and a
warrior is gonna be harder to one-shot at low level.

Hide and sneak could be useful in PvP, if the ranger ever actually had a
chance of succeeding the skill check.  :)  Tracking is only useful when
you're the hunter.

Yeah, beastlords before level 9 really don't have anything going for them at
all.

That may be the only reason on any other server...  on Discord it may not
even be an option.  No guarantee of seeing level 9.  :P
