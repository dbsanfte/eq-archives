I had it on a 500 mhz Celeron and was happy.  It's better on my 800 mhz
Athlon.  The question is using it with Everquest which really taxes a
machine.  The recommended CPU for SOL is a PIII and I believe the Celeron is
PII.   If you're experienced enough to strip the system, then it will help
as will tons of memory.  My boys play on home assembled systems and the
default services are 4 or 5 compared with 10 for a factory machine.  Less is
more with EQ.
