Yea, pretending the game character is real. I'm even able to do it in
newsgroup posts.

Using thee's and thou's isn't roleplaying. And my cloak is special
because I DIDN'T have to camp it for x hours or fork out an exuberant
amount of cash for it. I actually had *fun* getting it, and it was a
complete (and very pleasant) surprise.

And unlike your poor wittle warrior, I
1. have fun when I hunt in Velk's
2. get bored fast doing the /lfg routine and leave if I haven't gotten
anything in 5 or max. 10 minutes.

Since there really is only one belt I'd consider replacing it with
(two other belts are big maybes, should I come across them), 
I think it's safe to say I never will worry about it.

For your hypothetical partner's sake, I truly hope you don't regard
sex the same way you regard playing EQ.
