(Biz knows, some don't, so I'll repeat the first part)
I have a 57 enchanter, 52 druid, 49 wizard.  None of whom go into hiding
except on rare (once every couple months usually) occasions.

It sounds like yours and Lokari's server sucks.  I SHOULD be getting more
requests per day than you and Lok combined (since I regularly play two -
sometimes 3 if I'm doing rezzes with my brother's 60 cle <g> - characters at
a time), but the vast majority are polite enough (even though they might say
"plz" or forget that word altogether) and are not rude if I tell them no.
Hell, the last time someone couldn't take no for an answer was...musta been
6 months ago (and yeah, I remember who it was...Shadowkin).

I don't count newbie beggars in that, though...they are the things that are
right below SLIME in the food chain, so I don't matter to me.  But even with
them, very few get rude with me when I ignore them or say something not-kind
to them.
