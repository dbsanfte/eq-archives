I don't watch much TV ever, and when I do it's taped to replay later
fast-forwarding through commercials.  I was off work on Friday but even if I
was there (assuming that's when the story broke, I still haven't seen
anything) I may not have caught it because I usually only have time to read
local news and the comics.  My main source of world news is my Yahoo
homepage at work...and if I'm not at work....

"Your" as in "people who care."  Ken in particular, I wasn't very clear
