Just don't let it bother you too much, otherwise I think you'll burn
out on being a cleric when you get to higher levels because people are
going to die, sometimes often. From all you've posted here, you seem
to be an excellent, consciencous (sp?) cleris but it's still gonna
happen on occasion. If someone dies due to your mistake (which wasn't
the case in what you described but it's gonna happen), learn from it,
figure out what to do different next time, rez 'em and move on. 

Rgds, Frank
