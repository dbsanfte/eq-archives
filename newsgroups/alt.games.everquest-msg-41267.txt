I agree with you here Dark Tyger, kinda. Yeah, these people seriously
believe we are monsters, for whatever reason. Now, lets say we somehow get
rid of all the terrorist organizations. Does this somehow snap some sense
into the brainwashed people? Nope, and they'll be forming new terrorist
organizations before you know it. Send an American out there wearing a US
flag, and see if he survives the day. They might as well all be considered
terrorists, they're willing to kill like they are. People need to be civil
before I can see them as civilians.

I realize I'm using way too broad of generalizations, but I hope you see my
point. Not that I'm saying we should pull out the nukes and clear em all
out. We need to be careful whatever we do. I dont want to see anyone get
killed, but its going to happen. And I'm not going to feel bad if the people
who were celebrating the attacks get hurt in the crossfire. Sorry.

Joe
