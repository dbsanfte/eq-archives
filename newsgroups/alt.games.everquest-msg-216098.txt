I have started a mage. Now level 10. I have a couple of questions.

At what level does having the stein, shovel, broom etc. increases the
efficacy of the summoned pet?  Should I worry/spend on that now?

I saw the basic shovel, etc for sale in the bazaar at 200pp.  Could a solo
54 druid walk into Najena and easily camp them and get them for free, or is
it a group type place? I know little about Najena. My sense is, my main
could smoke through there.
