True; when they did the survey for the house I'm in now, the markers
were placed about ten feet or so in from the street. Not coincidently,
that's where the neighbor's fences and hedges started. It is effectively
mine, as far as walkways and plantings go, and if I don't mow it it doesn't
get mowed, but it isn't part of my property. (And if they ever put a
sidewalk there, I have to shovel it within 24 hours after a snowstorm.)
