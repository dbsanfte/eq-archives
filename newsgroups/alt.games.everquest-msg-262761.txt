I think this is where your argument falls off.  If somebody is spending
money to buy items, it is obvious they don't want to farm or quest.
They probably just want to be able to keep up with their friends to guy
hunting who do have that stuff.  Now, if somebody buys store bought
stuff just to go and kill bigger/badder mobs to get better equipment,
there is a deeper problem with them ;)

Making it NO DROP would probably be the only way the model would work,
but NO RENT would break that model.  If it was NO RENT, people would get
tired of buying it daily, and go back to IGE or wherever else to get the
non-NO RENT item.  IGE would then be back in business farming away.
