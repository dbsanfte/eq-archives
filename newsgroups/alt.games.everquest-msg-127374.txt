It's the inevitable conclusion of any debate between "free
will" and an "all-knowing, all-powerful, all-merciful" god.

Any god which knows *everything* knows not only what is, but
what will be, correct?  If that god *knows* the choices you
will make, you have NO "free will" from the god's point-of-view,
regardless of how much "free will" you have from yours.  The
god would *know* what you were going to do;  your path from
birth to the grave would be -- again, from the god's
point-of-view -- a path with no branches.

To take that argument to the logical conclusion, that god
not only knows what you're going to do, he knew when -- in
fact *before* -- he created you.  You were created without
any options from his point-of-view.  So, yes, it's his *choice*
to create you, knowing that you'll make the "wrong" decisions.
"Free will" from your point-of-view is meaningless since your
choice is known in advance.  You, after all, are *going* to
make the choice.  You were going to make that choice before
you were created.   So, no, you have no "free will."  And,
yes, *every* "wrong" choice is made *by god*, since only he
had the power to create you and *knew* you'd make that choice.
