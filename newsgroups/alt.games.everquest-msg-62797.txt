Right, and as I said in another post, it's because I work in "real life"
x,y,z all day, every day, that it bothers me....It's what I'm used to...I'm
sure most people don't work in coordinate system and don't really care what
the position of the numbers is, just as long as they can find their way.....

And just because it was taught in high school doesn't mean there aren't
people out in the world using geometry and trig every day.....
