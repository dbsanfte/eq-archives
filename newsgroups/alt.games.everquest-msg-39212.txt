I believe that is about right.

Yes, but especially for a lot of us Paladins (and SKs no doubt) horses are a
natural thing to our class.  It is like the Soulfire and Ghoulbane -
nowadays they are pitiful compared with better weapons out there that come
just as easily, yet they are a source of pride, because they are, as you
say, a status thing.  That is what the game is about to some degree,
developing your character, and the more elements you have to do that the
better, horses being one of those elements.  Sure, if you don't want to get
a horse that is no problem.  I can't imagine every player and his grandma
getting one nor do I think they should.  But it adds another element into
the game to further add to your character experience should you wish, and
especially for me as a Paladin, I look forward to it.

BTW, on the subject of SoW, many high level druids and shamans have said
they support it - stop people begging from them all the time.

Would be good even though I support the idea anyway, but no sorry :-(.
