If the bard isn't contributing to DPS via haste, DS, charmed pet
then what -is- he doing?  (yes, I fully understand that his
contribution to DS via hitting things with weapons is about what
you'd expect Keith Richards to do in heavyweight prize fight).  

(I can answer that question, he's pulling, mezzing, and otherwise
performing one of the half dozen other roles he's good at, bards
are more flexible than swiss army knives, er, I mean druids)

More to the point, given a recent thread where we examined this
issue in depth, DPS for most groups all centers around mana and
HP regen... a bard contributes those two things only when he's
actually around doing so.  IF he runs off, its like your KEI just
dropped and won't be back till he returns.  Now its entirely
possible that the benefits of always having one and only one mob
in camp so your melee don't ever have to stop putting out DPS yet
no healing mana is being wasted on an add outweights the
occaisional loss of potential manaflow... but of all the classes,
the bard is the one that costs the group the most when he's not
in range, so it is at least something to think about.

Thats not a bard thing, its a player thing.  I've seen druids and
necros and rogues and enchanters and clerics (well, me) and
warriors who can manage similar "perfect pulling" in the right
circumstances, heck, even I as a mage have pulled in just that
way, given access to SOW and the wide outdoors of OT to pull in. 
Bards have the tools to do it in much more places... but the will
and skill to pull like that, thats the province of the wetware
between your ears, not a function of the class.

I do appreciate that, and think there's even more I don't
understand about rogue pulling, I know not many seem to do it
well, but there are some who can break a single named out of the
middle of a crowded room and walk it back past a dozen mobs,
turning half an hours's clearing into a two minute "cherry
picking" operation.  I'm sure its a combination of hide, sneak,
archery, Run 3... but not having ever played or even been close
friends with a high level rogue I'm not familiar with the
details, which is something unfamiliar, in most cases I can help
clueless level 65s out with intricate details of their class
enough to get them up to at least the point where people don't
know they were EBayed for a half hour or more.

52 necro who wasn't aware she could mez anything but the undead,
and was going to reroll as something else so she'd be useful in
groups comes to mind.
