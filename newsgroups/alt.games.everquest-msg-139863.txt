My server (prexus) already has a Dutch channel, with one of my daily hunting
partners/friends being dutch (and several guildies).. if you set this up, I
can inform them for you

Something like  /autojoin serverwide.dutch:dutch would be easy enough for
people to remember (and I think, what they would instinctively type if they
were guessing a Dutch channel might exist, but didn't know)
