I'm going to guess either monk or shaman. I know members of both classes
on Xev who have solo'd to fifty almost exclusively. They group when the
opportunity comes up, but mostly they solo. The shaman has a nice
assortment of spells and pets (later on) to make it viable, and the
ability to disable the mobs and haste themselves. The monk is an awesome
damage dealer, and with FD, can bag out of most fights when things go
south. Might be a bit slower, but basically never dying is a very good
way to ensure steady progression.
