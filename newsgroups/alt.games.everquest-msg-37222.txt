The funny part is that they didn't used to be able to do this.

But they're Rangers, and the same time that a patch gave PC
Rangers the ability to cast See Invis (or cast it at a lower
level, I forget), the FV drachnids got the ability as well.

Suddenly, post-patch, FV was full of /shouts of, "WTF??", from
people who used to invis nonchalantly past the drachnids
but got a rude awakening that things had changed.
