Bash reduces my downtime, as stunned mobs don't do as much
damage... and ones who's spell casting was interrrupted to
Lots less.

Goofy hammer reduces my down time by increasing the group
damage rate; more damage out means less damage in.

Yaulp V Drastically reduces my down time.  How?  It
gives mana regen while standing, meaning I'm much more
able to not sit... a good cleric in most situations used
to consist of MOSTLY down time.  Before fight, during
fight, after fight.  Now I can pull (keeping Yaulp V up)
and melee (Keeping Yaulp V up) and buff (keeping Yaulp
V up) with comperably little reduction in mana regeneration.

Ethereal Light is... usesless and stupid.  Not a downtime
reducer

Ethereal Remedy is... looks nice for hard encounters,
a big heal for its speed.  Mana hog though.  Not a
downtime reducer

Ethereal Elixer is... freaky.  But I've already seen its
use from time to time, when damage is spread thru a
group but not coming in too fast.  Now that I'm out
of SF at last I'll have to see how it works on AE mob
raids.  Perhaps a downtime reducer, versus using
normal group heals.

Reducing cost of pet hammer means hammer gets
used almost constantly.  While this would seem to
increase down time (250 mana spent per mob) its
substantial damage output means mobs die faster,
which means they do less damage, which means
less healing is needed.  On moderately long lived
mobs, a net savings in mana.

Also, increases in cleric damage output means
mobs die faster, even if you discount the "less
damage recieved = less down time" arguement
(for example if you are a fear kiter) this still
results in more mobs per hour, not exactly the
same as downtime reduction, but not shabby
at all.

Perhaps you would have prefered an upgrade
to the class that better fit your idea of how a
cleric should be run, personally as a long time
battlecleric wannabe, half these improvements
were a dream come true.  Funny that it
wasn't the new heals I liked... but clerics were
already your premier healers, and these weren't
really much help.
