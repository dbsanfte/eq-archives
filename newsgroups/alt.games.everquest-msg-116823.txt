Eh, I'll concede this point, I installed RH7.2 but I was doing it via Linux
for Dummies which kinda frowns on doing a default installation (what do you
learn if you do default?  Nothing, of course).  I do have a "perfectly
acceptable" box for it...P75 64MB RAM which is, of course, nowhere near
acceptable if you intend to install a GUI.  It's good to know that Linux
geeks lie as much as Verant. :)

Errr, maybe I'm mistaken but isn't telling someone not to go into the
Terminal window equivalent to telling a Windows user not to use an MS-DOS
window?  My point was, end users do NOT like to have to open a black window
just to do maintenance-type things, such as installing software.  Try doing
everything from a GUI for a week (like Windows users can), and write down
everything you couldn't do or find.  I'll do the same thing for
Windows...let's see whose list is shorter by a long shot. ;)

I mentioned the version and the computer earlier.  I suspect that the
computer may have been not up to the task...either that or I simply didn't
have enough patience for something to take 10+ minutes doing nothing at all.
I have a P2-300 laying around here somewhere, I think, maybe I'll
appropriate that.

Can't do that.  When you buy a Dell you have all software pre-loaded.  IE
and OE are FINE software, except for all the hacks. ;)  I've used the ones
that are installed by default with RH and, well, they suck (the font is what
jumps out at me, and I couldn't figure out how to make it look at all
pleasing to the eye...slowness was another reason...there were others, I'll
have to download the latest dist and stick it on a newer computer).  Dell
comes with MS Office installed.   Formatting ANY Windows computer and
getting it back to minimal functionality just involves doing a default
Windows installation...voila, you're done.

Ok, you've got me thinking that it's time to screw around with Linux again.
:p   Now that HP is dumping the MPE operating system (what we use at work)
and we're all going to have to learn Unix in a few years, I'm thinking I
should probably spend more time playing with Linux.
