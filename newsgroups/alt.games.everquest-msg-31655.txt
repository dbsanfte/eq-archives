No violation here, there are plenty of drinks in Norrath, and I'm a master
at both making and drinking them. LoL, Toaster, I gotta remember that one

We have a winner.  Accoring to this Wannadrink is a possible violation, but
Beerdrinker is an encouraged surname? Odd.  Oh well,  I guess he'll just
have to live with the Surname Beerdrinker.

No violation here.

Wannadrink fits in fantasy if his character is a drunk.  Or better yet,
Beerdrinker, since it's an encouraged surname.
