Luclin has only one thing to offer a starting player: Paludal Caverns, and
excellent teens and tweens exp zone.

Arguments could be made for the Bazaar and being able to reap profits by
selling spiderling and spider silk and pelts harvested while killing
spiders, wolves, lions and bears, but that is not game-play.

Oh, you can also create chatacters of the Vah Shir race, cat-people.

Planes of Power has absolutely only one thing to offer a new player, and
that is the ability to use the portals to cross long distances safely and
easily. This isn't really crucial for a new player and takes away the
enjoyment of personal exploration.

As far as the latest expansion, Legend of Ykesha, you won't have much use
for it for quite some time unless you wish to make a character whose race is
Froglok (intelligent bipedal amphibians). Given the number of races
available, this is not crucial.

You have a lot to enjoy ahead of you, try not to let the legions of
experienced players ruin the adventure for you.
