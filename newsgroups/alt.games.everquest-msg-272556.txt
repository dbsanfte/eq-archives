I shouldn't do this, but...  What makes you think that's illegal?
When you agree to the terms they require for playing EQ/EQ2, part of
that agreement covers your behaviour on the official message boards
(see particularly sections 6 and 11 of the Everquest User Agreement).
If you violate that agreement and they ban you, the only one in the
wrong is you.
