Heh. I've been in there a lot lately, in fact, if I haven't crashed again, 
my trader is probably there now. :)  What I've thought would be helpful is 
if there was a list somewhere cross-indexing people's name in the channel 
with the name we know them from in the newsgroup.  Sure, most of us have 
our character name in the signature, but I find that I never remember 
them.  Well, except for a few, like Teapray, Lenny, Meems, and Monual.  
But I'd never know which name means "Ben Sisson", for example.  So fess 
up, who's playing who lately?  Or was there an actual a.g.e. webpage 
made? I vaguely remember talk of one.  I am:
