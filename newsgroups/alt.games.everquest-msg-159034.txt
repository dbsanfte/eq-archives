One thing I noticed about the more skilled clerics I grouped with
in low to mid 40s was that they mem'd either SHeal or CHeal, not
both, and almost always SHeal.  They'd use CHeal only when fighting
in situations where agro was consistently well controlled with a
"real" MT (usually Warrior, rarely a Knight), who they kept buffed
to max HP.  When multiple melees were taking damage (ex: fighting
in DL with no Enchanter) the Cleric would generally use SHeal when
a tank or Ranger dropped below half health (that was also a place
where they mem'd a dispel to take down those annoying DSes on the
drachnids).  I believe Bergh has oft opined here that CHeal starts
getting really valuable late in your 40s... might be a little lower
now for Warriors twinked with good HP gear.
