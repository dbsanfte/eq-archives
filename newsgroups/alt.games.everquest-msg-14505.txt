Very odd, and definitely the wrong kind of meleeing cleric. If he were
doing appreciable damage and/or just taking a couple swings for
practice purposes it could be understandable, but he should have taken
proper care of heals as well. Heck, not a single warrior in the group
and he's leaving you stranded until you have 1 bubble left? I know
clerics who CHeal warriors at 2 bubbles and freely dispense supHeal on
everyone else.
Hope you made a note of this cleric's name. Don't group with him
again.
