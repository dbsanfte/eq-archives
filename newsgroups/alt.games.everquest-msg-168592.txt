Killed him quite a few times.  (Damn, I love that hammer, even more than the
41 percent haste neck...).

Get him slowed immediately, and you'll have no problems with him.  (other
than possibly keeping the gnome alive during the fight. (not necessary for
loot, but is for flags)).  He sounds much worse than he actually is.  Spread
out any paladins you have for group heals on the AE, and make sure the
groups know to stay together.

If you're interested in keeping the gnome alive... Spin the dragon so the
gnome is attacking from behind, and make sure the raid does not push the
dragon.  If he moves too far, the gnome will summon him back.   Do not aggro
the gnome at any time during the final fight,  nor mez / mem blur him.

As others mentioned, during the walk you have to keep everyone out of his
way.  He will poof if he tries to walk through someone.  We've had very good
luck with detailing a group or two to walk with the gnome, and having the
rest a room ahead clearing mobs.   You can mez the gnome all you want during
this stage, just not the final fight.
