The one *you* were discussing.  The one that is unabashedly irrelevant to
the *actual* discussion.  You really would be well served by going back and
reading the post that started this thread and my reply to it (wherein you
will find none of your nonsense that you seem to think the discussion is
about).

As to your wife, when she asks you if you think Catherine Zeta Jones is
prettier than her, might I suggest "If everything else, for the sake of
argument was exactly the same, except she was named Catherine Zeta Jones,
then how could she possibly be prettier?"

Also, go with the Do-It-Yourself-Divorce package.  You'll need that money
you save, trust me.  :)
