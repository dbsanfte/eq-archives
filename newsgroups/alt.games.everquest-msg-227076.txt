I do have my insane moments, usually related to in-game fashion, but
fortunately this wasn't one of them. *grin*

We once saw a 10-stack listed in LUcy...got so excited as my husband ran
off to buy 10 and try to combine them in his bearskin potion bag.  No
luck. :(

And fyi, the muglwump in the warrens drops insta-cast invis potions as
well for those who don't know. Not every kill sees one drop, but I make a
habit of killing him everytime I run to LoY zones, and it usualy keeps me
in healthy supply of free potions.  And the heal potions he drops are fun
to pass out to young-uns. :)

Speaking of, though, aren't there some high-end self-invis items for the
uber? I seem to recall Monual mentioned some item he uses to invis.

My "favorite" zone for this stuff is Veksar...with a little knowledge of
the mob placement and access to both invis and itu, one can get to any
camp up to nobles very very fast.  Unless you have people new to the zone.  
I usually go crossed-eyed by the time we've hit the shops.
