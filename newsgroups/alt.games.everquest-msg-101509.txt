I actually had a very weird effect going on the other night in
Lavastorm.  If I clicked anywhere that there wasn't something else, it
would target a (lava I think, but I'm not sure) basilisk.  The big
problem was that someone was killing off shadowed men, and I had a hard
enough time figuring out where the corpses were.  So my text screen was
full of /cons of the basilisk.  Finally, I ended up using "locate
corpse" and /loot, to make my life much simpler.
