Actually, I believe the phrase is idiomatic in Aramaic.  It's more
along the lines of "Kill-steal my orc pawn and I'll kill you" than
a literal threat.

Just imagine how bloody and violent someone translating common
English a thousand years from now would think most people were
if they took all "... is going to kick your ass" and ".. is
going to kill you" literally...
