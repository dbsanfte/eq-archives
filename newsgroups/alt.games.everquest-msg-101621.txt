Are you agnostic?

My agnostic DE mage was able to get past the guards and get a bind
from a player just outside the Warrens.  I don't remember the con from
the Paineel guards, but he was only dubious to the Erudin guards.  He
did kill a number of kobolds in Toxx before moving into the Warrens.
Killing kobolds in the Warrens and Toxx gives faction with the guards
in both cities as I recall.
