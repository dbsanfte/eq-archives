Get a Shadel Bandit ring for one of them, I'd say 2 if they weren't lore,
get a 6ac/65hp for the other, but keep one of the diamond rings for resist
gear if you want.

Very hard to make due to rarity of cazicite chunks and expensive due to mana
vials, but if you have it already, it's fairly good, but some BD cultural
would be better, and every cleric race except halfling and erudites can
smith BD cultural plate of some sort, both halflings and erudites tailor
their BD plate (same basic stats except who can wear and potential imbues),
and halflings can wear dirf smithed plate.

Orb of the Infinite Void is 100% own over the kitty litter shield and on
most servers cheaper too, wtg logic.

Focus doesn't work on CH and HoTs (celestial elixir) and it's only a so-so
item not counting the focus.
