   I know GetsumJ from the game (I assume that it's the
same person, though I suppose that could be wrong).  I
may have grouped with him once or twice, and I've certainly
chatted with him a few times.  He's always been a pleasant
person to be around.  When he recognizes one of my lowbie 
alts (he knows Tealeef the best) he has offered me supplies
if needed.  He's not know, by me anyways, to be a grief 
player.  I would group with him in a heartbeat.
   Not that one could guess any of that from the few posts
of his that I've seen here.  Very odd.  Perhaps it really
is a different person.  Maybe the random name generator
kicked out "Getsumj" twice on different servers?
