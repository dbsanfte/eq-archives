Underutilized in what sense? You mean the lack of 50+ farmers in there facing
no danger whatsoever to get all the good drops? Yeah, you're probably right.
However, my low level "screw around when bored" alt has found that zone to be
very populated (at least on Xev... YMMV) with people of lower levels getting xp
and sometimes organizing multiple group attacks on big things like the
mugglewhump or whatever the fuck it's called.  Admittedly, even if I could get
in there with my Troll, I wouldn't be able to get much in the way of good drops
because of my level, but hell, I have no interest in adventuring there anyway.
I'll never make 45 in the Warrens.
