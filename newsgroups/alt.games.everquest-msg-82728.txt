My ignore list would fill very fast...My Bard (mule in EC) permanently has a
full ignore list (30) and I have to read it, look for someone whose name I
don't recognise (means I no longer remember what they did so time to take
them off) to remove to add another moron. The ignore list does not drop the
name from above the avatar if it did (and was a larger list) I'd never
bother with petitions...

Necro called "Painfulanal" I petitioned, Monk called "Jettli Trainsalot" I
did not, not because it isn't in violation just because I can't be bothered,
he still won't get any ports, buffs, sows or heals from me.

I choose to play the game as a fantasy enviroment it was meant to be, some
names I can't bring myself to ignore and I will petition them, feel free to
question my priorities, life style, sexuality as much as you like...I'll
still do it.
