Damage shield potions are made by shaman, last for about 20 minutes
and are totally useless for a 1st lvl character since the damage is
determined by the level of the person using it. 

There's 2 types, one does (lvl+1)/4 for a cost of around 10p. 
One does (lvl +1)/2 for a cost of about 35p. 

Prices aren't exact but should be close, too lazy to look it up atm.
Note that it's the price to make one, doesn't count cost for failures,
etc. You can probably expect to pay about double that.
