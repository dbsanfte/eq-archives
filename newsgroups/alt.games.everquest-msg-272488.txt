Or you can do what I do, never ever click through the DRM prompts.  If
I'm at a website and I unexpectedly get such a prompt, I refuse it.
If I launch a WMV file and it pops such a request, I immediately
terminate the program (via Task Manager if I have to) and delete the
file.

As for the academics, try explaining to them that having one or more
degrees does not give them the right to show less common sense than a
6 year old child.
