<snip lost money story>

I know that there are some issues with picking up money off the ground
if it's about to disappear. That may have been what happened. I've
picked up money occasionally, and sometimes it goes into the inventory,
sometimes it doesn't. Either way, I figure, I'm no worse off, so I don't
give it too much thought. You might just want to let it lay on the
ground, though, in the future just in case.
