Smaller guilds couldn't clear PoA with 24 people... so added to the fact CoH
doesn't work in there, AND the first isle (keymaster) sells coffins (albeit
at a very damn expensive price) I think SC was a deliberate "workaround" for
raids that couldn't get enough keys..  disabling CoH but leaving SC meant
people wouldnt just hop across each isle summoning for the fun of it.. due
to the cost you have to make each summon count

imo anyway
