Gee, I'm sorry biz, let me rephrase:  The recorded history of the wars
and atrocities committed in Europe and Asia over the last few millenia
is a monument to the evil OF self-serving and self-righteous men, before
which the blathering of a handful of petty fools (a club including
GetsumJ and Cyrakis along with Lewinsky and Tripp) pales into
insignificance.

There, is that better?  No less sexist than Cyrakis blather, and now
nazi-free with bizApproved(tm) phrasing.

Oh, and while I may have made the questionable decision to respond to
the troll attempting to amplify the original troll, the topic of
women guild leaders had already been left behind prior to my post.
