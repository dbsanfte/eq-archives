Yep, elsewhere in the thread I noted:

"A surprisingly nice one is the one that slows your eating rate
down.   "Improved Natural Metabolism" There are some very nice
stat/resist increasing food items out there, trouble is
eventually even if you deliberately force eat other foods to
preserve them, eventually you are going to go AFK longer than
expected somewhere without hiding the good food, and eat them.
Eating and drinking less often would help stretch this out.  If
you don't eat stat foods, it won't be all that big a help, just
save you 10, 25 and 50% on the pittance you put into food and
drink, if forage isn't working in the zone you are hunting in. As
a Vah Shir my metabolism is twice as fast as anyone elses, so I
get the reverse effect there, bad thing about Cat Bards is they
find it harder to use stat foods.  Ah well, we look good, and
thats whats important."

As for Regen, well I meant for a bard, and addressed that one too:

"Regen, on the other hand, is a joke IMO, with lute and the 55
heal/mana song on I'm getting 25 hp per tic back, its not often
that one or two more are going to matter to me.  Of course this
works all the time, not just when singing that song... but I've
very rarely been in a circumstance where a tiny bit more regen
would matter to me; if I need some regen (even while fighting) I
just start including the song in my twist.  Primary slot string
instrument helps a lot here, if you can get one..."

Bards are probably the class that would find regen least useful; healers have
little use for it because its so slow but it might save them a bit of mana.
Melee find it more useful since their main down time is regenning HP.  Necros
and shaman (and to a limited extent mages) find it most useful since they are
actively trading HP for mana all the time.  Bards though.. well it costs nothing
to run healsongs but a twist slot, and if you are grouped you run that song a
lot anyway.  I actively mock people who insist on healing me up to full before
sitting down to med; save the mana I'll heal while we wait for you to make back
what you already spent!

I suppose -some- classes could make a case for buying run 3, metabolism 3, regen
3, and even First Aid 3.  Bards, not so much.  Nor clerics, which are the only
cases I've really looked into.
