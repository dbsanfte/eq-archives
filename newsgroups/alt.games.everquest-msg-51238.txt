Agreed that doing the hosts fix is a pain for non-geeks and
it was a good tip to ping patch.everquest.com

Didn't know you could add that type of info there, thought that
was just for telling a connection what the address of the DNS(s) 
to use. A local ISP here a few friends use had the "can't find 
patch"server problem even though their net connection was fine 
for all other things and the hosts entry did the trick
