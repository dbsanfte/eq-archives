i said the "not too interested in the official rules" bit to try and
discourage the official vs gentlemanly threads we have often seen in the
past. you know the ones where theres some guy that allways takes the
official line just because its the official line.

but, ye, this guy did need a kick in the balls. because i wasn't too sure of
the gentlemanly way of acting i just let the selfish bast have all 3.

i ve added him to /friends and will tell him about this thread next time we
are both on. then unadd him from /friends and forget about it.

also next time i am multi-camp-spot pharming i will make a hot key for the
/ooc camp checks i get something like this:

/ooc am  / sage / frenzy but if you want 1 or 2 send a tell

it is quite clear theres is a majority view here. summed up nicely by
jazzmanian devil:

 "You and I would be in total agreement if it weren't for the fact that
you're talking about *a* camp *spot* (singular) and the OP was talking
about some jerk holding down three different areas. If you have the guns
to hold down five different spawn points, and nobody else is around to
hunt them, then I say, Fine. Go for it. But if you want to "camp"
something, by definition that means you'd better be there, watching it,
and ready to go when the spawn pops, or I won't respect your claim.  So
long as you're staying there tending it and legitimately camping it, I
won't even ask to share, or when you'll be done, etc. I'll just go on my
way. But if I show up and there's nobody there, invis or otherwise, then
as far as I'm concerned, the spot is open."
