Not exactly in game, but in real life, I've seen
last name - Dicks
last name - Pollock
last name - Butts
and once talked to a hillbilly sounding guy from Arkansas who's name Was
actually "Billy Brown".
And not to sound totally sick, but I've never liked the sound (combined with
its exact spelling) of the name "Dickinson". (separate the letters) I'm not
up to the kind of relationship that name suggests (who first had that name,
and HOW did they get it?).

Anybody else think of any real life funny names they've seen?
