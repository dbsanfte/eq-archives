I've got some news for you. He isn't the only one. I thought CoH was great 
fun, a real breath of fresh air....for about a month. Then it became just 
more of the same simple game day in and day out.

Oh, by the way, most of the people I heard from who had that same 
experience said the same thing - it was a novelty, a delight in it's 
simplicity. It gave incredible first impressions but had zero staying 
power.

If you're gonna quote someone, at least provide an accurate context and all 
the facts, like the fact that the rest of you undoubtedly felt the same way 
when you first picked up the game.
