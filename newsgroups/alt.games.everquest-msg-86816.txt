There's a scalemail quest that you can do as a lowbie that requires some low level of
smithing skill.  Not more than 10 or so, I'd guess.  As an iksar monk I was able to make a coif with
no skill at all.  That was Shestar's Scalemail Coif quest, I think.

Several things that drop in the Field of Bone are used for armor:  Loose scale, Wolf scale,
Scaled Wolf hides, etc.
