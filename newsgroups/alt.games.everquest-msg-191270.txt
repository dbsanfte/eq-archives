Yes, GMs on server shouldnt have anything to do with this sort of issue. 
It should be irrelevant whether or not you have killed the mob.

Current setup: there is a timer on corpses all round the world of EQ, if
you dont loot in time you lose the stuff. ~Everyone has to deal with it.
It is arguable that by failing to bring enough people to successfully loot
up then you are not doing the challenge as well as it can be.....the kit
it powerful and no drop sure, but thats known, its an issue in the
challenge. Roll beforehand, have enough that someone can disengage to
loot, or request that there enough no drop items now at all levels that
are good that need a longer timer. (and frankly that last is more sensible
than the other ideas IMO, though if SOE came back with them Id shrug and
see their point).

If the timer is different in PoP then this is a matter to be dealt with
out of game by direct petitions to SOE to change that loot timer. If the
problem is significant enough across the broad range of levels (where
there are drops that are worth a lot comparatively at that level) then
again there should be a drive to increase that timer across the range -
again an out of game issue for dealing with GMs.

I can see a petty good case for requesting a longer loot timer (or even a 
drive to requesting that a /consent be done on the corpse to make it free 
looting) - arguing that kills from groups can need a longer time to sort
out (the point of the timer being that the killer gets first loot after
all), maybe even Raids only getting special treatment - that ties the
longer timer to PoP more which might suit the high level guilds where this
is probably more of an issue.

I just dont think that such an in game/character action should be dealt
with ad hoc by a GM on server in game - the setup is there and everyone is
aware of it and to have GMs messing around a) basically says the rules
dont matter and if someone whines enough they can do you over, b) any real
problem is not getting addressed properly anyway and c) the first two
arent really distinguishable properly becuase its all merged into a server
GMs ideas....

As such sorting it long term and short term should be dealt with as far as
interaction with GMs is concerned out of the game and direct with SOE or
on the forums etc.....a player working inside the rules isnt breaking them
and shouldt be hit by out of game forces for it....

Now what you do to the individual concerned who has breached significant
social rules in the game as far as in game reaction is your oyster - you
got the description, you pass it round.....thats a different matter and go
get the ninjalooter, leave him to die in nasty situations, dont rex him,
make sure those who suffered from his actions also make him suffer...there
is plenty you can do without crossing SOE's lines.
