There isn't one.  There are plenty of websites, and many of them have 
discussion boards, but very few of them are 'good', and fewer still, if 
any, focus exclusively on dire charm.

However, a.g.e here is a learned batch of generalists who may know the 
answers to any specific questions you may have about dire charm.  You 
would do well to avail yourself of this resource, rather than barging in 
and saying, "I don't wanna talk to you, where's the specialists?"
