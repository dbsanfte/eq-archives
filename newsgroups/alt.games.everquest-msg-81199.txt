... I LIKE Bizbee. I think he has some opinions that people can learn from.
I think he says what he feels. I think that, wholeheartedly, he knows what
he's talking about. (and I say "he" only because I do not know if he is a he
or a she, but I guess the former). I LIKE the fact that he doesn't take
bshit from people. I LIKE the fact that Biz answers questions in the
"spirit" in which they are asked.

OK... I just plain like Biz. Flame away.

Just my .02 worth
