As one of my guild officers says "Velks is teh EXP!". It was the only
place to grind high level exp with a pick up group back in the day,
and it is the best, easiest, quick, pickup group exp now that I know
of. (Very near a PoK book.) That being said, I have become sick to
death of Velks, can't stand to set foot in there after about 10 hours
total of grinding there. And I've only seen the damn entrance. =)

There must be better places to exp now, but as you said it's always
camped, so a pick up group is easy to get there. Even if they are
morons, the zone is a quick hop away.
