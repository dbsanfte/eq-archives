If you RP, almost everyone else will RP with you. There are a few
"doods" running around, but most of the people playing on the server
are mature and like to stay in character.

The world isn't empty, but it does have a low population. If you stick
to the popular zones you will usually find other players. Most of the
"problems" that occur on regular servers are related to overcrowding.
You won't have to worry about that on FV :-).

"Twinking" is a lot different on FV. Many players suffer from
"rerollitis". I have heard of people with characters in their 40s
re-rolling to try something new. So if you see a twink, don't assume
that FV has the same problem as other servers. 

>> 3) Any tips from players on FV

Play the Character (Race/Class) that you want to play. (You only get 1
to play with per account)

If you want others to RP with you, you need to RP with them. RP starts
with you and ends with you, if you know what I mean. 

I would also recommend that you turn off Shout and Auction (Especially
in the newbie zones), if you want to avoid non-RP shouts and comments.

The best decision I ever made in EQ was moving to the FV server.Give
it a shot. You might just like it.
