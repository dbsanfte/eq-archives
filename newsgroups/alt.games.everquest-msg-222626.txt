    You need to read his definition of griefer to understand it. "Nailing
people that piss me off" sure sounds like someone that likes to be annoying
to me, as opposed to someone that just lets things go because "they're only
pixels". It's the EQ version of road rage, and reading your posts here, you
qualify. ;-) You were in the bottom third or so, so it's not like it's the
most important part of your game.

    Because others have respect for him, given that he is a guild leader.
The question says something about how you view guilds. Do you see them as
groups dedicated to a goal, groups which presumably have as leader someone
with leadership skills whom they respect (and who is deserving of that
respect), or do you see them as random collections of players that could
have any old moron as GL? Let me ask you - how did you score on Group
Affiliation? I'd assume very, very low.

    I liked it. It came back with about what I figured I'd get - Achievement
85%, Group Affiliation 45%, Griefing and Relationship 35%, and Immersion at
15%.
