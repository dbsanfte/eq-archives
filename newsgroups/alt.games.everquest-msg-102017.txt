Well, I don't do this, but being a 55th Druid, I sure get alot of requests
for buffs, I just thought I would relate a couple of them to you here:

Situation #1:
Loser: Can u buf me plz?
Me: <casts SoW>
Loser: n e more?
Me: no

Situation #2:
Valiant: Pardon me wise one, Could I beg for the blessing of Karana as I
attempt to slay these evil ones?
Me: <casts 250hp buff, SoW, +10point regen buff, Shield of thorns 20point
DS, 40 point STR buff>
Me: May Karana Guide your steps

Who wins? the guy you got done typing sooner? or the guy who took all of 3
seconds to be polite and respectful?

Mullo 55th Druid
