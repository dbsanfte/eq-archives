Yeah I agree that it was not money well spent hiring Heather Graham and 
Christoper Lee. By the time I hear those voices one of us probably won't 
even be alive lol.

However, adding all the voiceovers for the regular NPCs was a good design

just can't. Not sure if it was worth the cost (no idea what it cost) but it 
sure is a nice element.
