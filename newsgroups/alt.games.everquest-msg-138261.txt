Agree on Howling Stones, but if you're looking for pickup groups at 52
you are looking at a very long row to hoe if you want "new, fun and
exciting". Are you in a guild of like leveled people? You really need to
go group up and hit some fun dungeons.

I would also reccomend the Hole if you can get up a full group with an
evaccer and some crowd control. Once you get past the evercamped entry
mobs, it's generally deserted and the xp bonus there is insane. Plus the
odd drops of weapons and loam armor that you can sell in the bazaar for
a nice chunk of change.
