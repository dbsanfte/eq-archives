Well I for one am glad they are going to remove the flagging requirements for
2nd tier planes. Being a Beastlord I was in constant demand by my guild for
trials and I hate getting called from PoV, PoS, BoT or CoD to help more guildies
get flagged. Now I can concentrate on getting my Spectral parchments and runes
for next 3 levels. Making those flagging trial made it hard for some classes to
get through and made other classes in too high demand to allow them to continue
on without looking like total elitist to the younger members of their guild.

All I say is it is about fuggin time.
