As a young Vah-Shir I have been attempting to acquire an acrylia slate. Each
time I get to the acrylia mine I'm told I need to show my journeyman's cloak
in order to be issued the goods but I never received a cloak. So I went back
to the village and re-traced my steps a few times to see if I missed
something but alas, I am at a loss. Has anyone else experienced this or know
what I'm missing?

Thanks,

Erik
