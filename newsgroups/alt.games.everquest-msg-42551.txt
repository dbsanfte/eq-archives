I suggest taking up tailoring from as early as you can. Even if you don't
plan to take it to great heights it still gives a good feeling of how it
works and you can increase your cash amount a bit as well (not much though).

Also for all melee classes I advise to otry a bit of fletching early on.
It's good to have 125 range arrows, makes pulling a lot easier. Alse the
first few levels of fletching cost practically nothing. Selling 1 Rusty
Sword should get you up to skill 10 or so, the next sword will make you
trivial for the most basic ones (lvl 16)
