No, aside from some pretty elaborate rip-off scams (and there are some,
sadly) the bazaar makes it pretty hard to rip people off anymore. That's
why I was endorsing it and trying to help the OP with instructions on
how to use it to his advantage. He was hesitant about using it, and
didn't understand it's inherent advantages in doing what he hoped to
accomplish. I was also drawing a comparison for him about *why* it's so
much better, by comparing it to the pre-bazaar days where he'd have had
a high likelyhood of getting reipped off in either /auction, or EC or
GFay, etc. by the various "haggling is good roleplay" shitheels.
