}I got visible exp handing in crafted quest items around level 35; a
}nice chunk of it, too.

Yep, I got a massive chunk (about 1/2 a yellow) when a guy I was grouped 
with handed them in in my early 20's.  I wonder how many levels you'd gain 
if you were level 1? :)

I wouldn't be suprised if there was a simple rule, though, like "No quest 
exp for you if you would stand to gain more than an entire level."

I know I didn't get experience trying to hand in kobold hides in Qeynos at 
the warriors guild at level 1, but it _may_ be quest specific.

On the 'not doable at level xx' thing:  It's possible that people are 
saying that on the allakhazam forum when they mean 'you won't get exp for 
doing it at level xx'... Apparently, to many people, not getting exp makes 
the quest entirely pointless.  Being a faction junkie, I have a somewhat 
different take on it. :)
