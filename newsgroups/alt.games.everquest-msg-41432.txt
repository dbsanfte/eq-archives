Exactly the same quote was reported on my guild's website. I searched
around and the closest I could find was:

Century 1, Quatrain 87
Ennosigee feu du centre de terre,
Fera trembler autour de cit� neuue
Deux gras rochers long t�ps feront la guerre,
Puis Arethuse rougira nouueau fleuue. 
Earth-shaking fire from the center of the earth.
Will cause the towers around the New City to shake,
Two great rocks for a long time will make war,
And then Arethusa will color a new river red. 

Quite clearly referring to volcanic/earthquake events

Century 6, Quatrain 97
Cinq & quarante degr�s ciel bruslera
Feu approcher de la grand cit� neuue [neufue]
Instant grand flamme esparse sautera
Quand on voudra des Normans faire preuue. 
At forty-five degrees, the sky will burn,
Fire approaches the great new city,
Immediately a huge, scattered flame leaps up
When they want to have verification from the Normans.

These are an amalgamation of out of context, vastly separated semi-
quotes, with a huge slice of poetic licence.

You can put away those 'End of the World is Nigh' placards now..
