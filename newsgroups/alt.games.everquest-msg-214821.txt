I have to agree with Annie here.

I think bards have an edge in rarity, mainly because the class is so
complex (and physically demanding) to play. Mages - in fact any class
that can solo relatively easily - do not enter the picture.

(Bards can't solo *easily*. The main Bard solo methods are very tricky to
do; they can get awesome experience in doing it, but getting it done is
quite difficult.)

When I see a high-level bard, I usually recognise their name. That isn't
remotely true of mages.
