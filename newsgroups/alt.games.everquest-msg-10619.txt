Blew smoke? No, I didn't miss it. It happens every time someone asks Verant
about the inexcusably shoddy collision-avoidance programming in their game.

Now, is it inferior programming, or simply piss-poor game design? That's
hard to say, since the lame excuse changes depending on what day it is. One
way or another, it's incompetence. Based on some of the other bonehead
decisions Verant has made, I'd lean toward shoddy game design, but there's
really no way to be sure.

I mean, look at how he describes the "we need 40 players to even use this
expansion" complaint. In one breath he says that they don't want that kind
of complaint (duh, of course they don't -- that would be a colossal design
failure, if true), but in the next he says they wanted *exactly* that for
Sleeper's Tomb, and he's *disappointed* that a group of Ubers can do it with
less! "Hello, my name is Gordon, and I have no grasp of game design."

The article is littered with this sort of thing, but it's not exactly news.
Reading the patch messages archived on Caster's Realm makes it clear that
Verant has a pretty feeble grasp of what people who actually play EQ want
(with the exception of PKers: they seem pretty happy with how those servers
are run).

[ ad hominem attacks snipped]

These are irrelevant.
