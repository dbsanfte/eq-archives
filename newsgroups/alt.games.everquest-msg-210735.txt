Embarrassingly enough...yes :�(

DE
Str 70
Sta 75
Agi 90
Dex 75

Gnome
Str 70
Sta 80
Agi 90
Dex 85

Assling
Str 80
Sta 85
Agi 100
Dex 90

All Warriors have 25pnts to spend.

Gnome's beat us in Stamina and Dex but Asslings, they just own us :�(

I can only assume they thought people would want DE Melee's anyway due to
the Salvatore novels alone, not to mention every other anti hero rip off of
Moorcock's Elric. So they made them the least attractive to play, stat wise,
to save Norrath from being over run by Teir'dal Warriors, Rogues and SK's
:�)

Frodo Baggins versus Drizzt Do'Urden....Any contest?
