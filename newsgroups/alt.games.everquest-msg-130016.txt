Look back at the attributions.  You introduced the subject - I'm
asking for clarification.

What does the past ill-treatment of Native North Americans by
the colonisers have to do with the present situation between
Israel and Palestine?  I don't understand what it has to
do with the argument.

You seem to think that, somehow, any American that doesn't
know how to put the genie back in the bottle and make everything
alright with the original inhabitants shouldn't say or do anything
to try to prevent something equally horrible happening *today*.

What I'm not understanding is why the fact of past wrongs
should make people say nothing about current wrongs.

Terrorism, as it is defined, is a matter of opinion.  Our opinions
differ, so we call different people terrorists.

What is "civilised" depends on your perspective.  Those early
settlers with the smallpox blankets thought *they* were the
civilised ones too.  Our perspective varies.
