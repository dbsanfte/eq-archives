Quite the opposite..they seem to be hinting that certain aspects of
legends, at least, will be brought over to regular servers....from
castersrealm...

quote

Gamespot recently interviewed John Smedley about the upcoming legends
server.  Here are some snippets:

Will the effort and resources required to maintain the new service
detract at all from the basic EverQuest servers? 

Absolutely not--in fact, it's just the opposite. We plan on moving the
content from the Legends servers over to the other servers on a
periodic basis. 

End Quote

Now that may be total BS..but if it can be believed...then We regular
server folk might be seeing the same content as legends folk..just a
little longer down  the road??
