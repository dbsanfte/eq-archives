Solist's Icy wand, right click Direct damage.  38 DD every 6 seconds,
usuable at level 12. 

At level 12 it makes you a god with no mana limit.  At 30 it is a nice
downtime reducer.  at 40+ its a nice toy.

ULTRA rare drop in Kurns Tower.  I have bought them for as low as 1k
and sold them as high as 10k.
