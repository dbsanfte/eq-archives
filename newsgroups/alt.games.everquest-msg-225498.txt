More importantly, since there's no exp for being the highest damage 
group, people don't get stupid and burn heavy trying to outdo all the 
other groups; I saw a massive drop in wizard deaths after raid mode came 
into the game, and also saw a lot more situations where nuking mana was 
available when it counted, instead of being spent on all the trash mobs 
along the way.

And I was in the "ks group" on many occaisions, even though this was 
well before the massive upgrade to group exp, we'd still come out of a 
raid with more experience than we could have earned doing anything else 
short of a PB AE group.  One group getting 90% of the kills, but 5 
groups doing the killing?  Great deal, thanks for feeding us your exp guys!

Raid leaders can also build groups to do specific roles now, without 
worrying about trying to also balance out their damage production so 
each group would get some of the exp.  Not that all of them did so by 
any means, a frequent cry was "raid exp doesn't matter".  But the truth 
is, if you were in one of the DPS groups, raid exp did matter a lot, as 
I said above, it was some of the best exp in the game, a dirty little 
secret kept from the rank and file, curious how often a raid leader or 
his favorites were in the group that was getting all the exp.

Since either making a KS group on purpose or trying to spread the kills 
out evenly meant making a raid less effiecient than it could be, those 
were both IMO bad things that were solved by the raid mode.

At the same time, I really don't get why raid exp has to suck so badly. 
  They encourage grouping, giving you a bonus (a small one back then, a 
large one now) the more people you have in the group... but the second 
you go to the seventh man, you not only don't see the upward curve of 
higher and higher bonus continued, you actually lose all the bonus and 
drop down to solo exp rate (or worse, I have seen rumors its actually 
worse than soloing somehow)

What stops them from saying "OK< its just like grouping, two people get 
so much, 3 so much more, 6 so much... anything over 6 will be capped at 
that rate, but hey, you got at least a full group together, here's your 
reward!"

Its bad enough that most raids have far more people than they need to 
kill everything up to the final target, but it adds insult to injury to 
make them work, not for a smaller slice of the pie, but for a smaller pie!
