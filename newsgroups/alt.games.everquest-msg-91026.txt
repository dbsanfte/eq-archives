A little late to jump in on this post, but has to be said...

When it comes down to it... Do you think that posting the same question
over and over again, inquiring 'Why is it down?  When when it be up? What
happen to <server>?' requires to be posted or needs to be responded to?

It is like taking a pad of post-it notes sticking them on a surface with
the same, inane question, thinking that "More is Better."  It's a waste of
space and effort to have people doing that when one question is fine.

Just cause they deleted other posts refering to the same question, doesn't
mean they could care less.  But it should doesn't make the situation
resolve faster doing the Bart Simpson "Are we there yet?" posting either.
