    The planes are linear. To get to Plane of Time, one will have to kill
ALL the gods in the previous planes. I haven't seen a guild that's killed
more than one of the Tier three gods yet (of four). And once they clear tier
three, they still have tier four (elemental planes) to clear before making
Plane of Time. It won't be as fast as some people think.
