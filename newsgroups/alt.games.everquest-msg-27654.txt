Level 51+ enchanter, druid with almost full use of a 57 cleric, none of whom
go /role very often.  Nah, the sow and clarity begs generally don't bug me
unless I get a tell from someone in EC saying "can u crack me plz?" or in
Steamfont and someone says "can u tp me to WC."   I turn around in a circle
once...if I can't see them I ignore their tells.  If they're not close
enough to me not to cast it on them right then, screw 'em...I don't have all
day to wait for their sorry begging asses to run to me (I NEVER deliver
unless 100+p is involved).
