Har!  Indeed so. :)  I'm reminded of one particularly good one, when we 
were fighting the Itraer Vius...  Our MT was blinded, of course, so he 
didn't know until after the fight that the wizard in his group had 
accidentally hit his exodus hotkey about 5 seconds into the fight.  He 
kept calling for cure blindness, and all the curer-types were complaining 
in /rs about him being out of range.

The amazing part is, we won the fight anyway.  That's about when we knew 
it was time to move on to a harder mob. :)
