I used to completely agree with you about mana pool (I got to 
65 with an unbuffed mana pool barely large enough to cast Mass
Mystical Transvergence).  

For XP groups, I still agree with you.  Our recent small (15-20
people) am raids are swaying me toward a larger mana pool.  Ice
and wind bosses last just about 3 minutes in our fights, and I'm
one of the big DPS classes in those fights.  In these fights I 
often expend my entire 4200 buffed mana and a rod shot (360) as
well as 30 ticks at 50-70+ mana per tick (depending on who's 
there for the raid).  The extra 1k mana means an extra 6k damage
over the course of the fight.
