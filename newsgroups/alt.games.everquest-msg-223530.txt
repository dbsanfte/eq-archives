Have you ever developed a testing plan yourself?  Coordinated all aspects of
testing in a controlled test environment?  Ever performed unit testing ...
integrated testing ... regression testing?

Do you even know what those are?

Somehow, I doubt it.

I would go into what's involved, but I doubt you'd get it (or care to ...
all you seem interested in doing is bitching).

So:

#include <stdio.h>

int  main(void)

{
    char response;

    printf("Well, do you hate the game or not? (y/n)    ");

        {
            if ((response = getchar()) == y)
                {
                printf("Don't let the door hit you on the ass on your way
out. \n");
                printf("No, I don't want your stuff);
                }
            else
                printf("Fine then ... quit whining about stuff you've chosen
to deal with.");
        }
     return 0;
}
