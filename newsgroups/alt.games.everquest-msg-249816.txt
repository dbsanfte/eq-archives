You have to ask yourself, though: Why is so much content abandoned?
Why is it so hard to find a group?  Is the PoK transport system
the cure for the disease?  Or is it just suppressing it, and putting
the body on temporary life support?

It seems to me you may have identified a disease, but not the right
cure.  Is the right cure to allow people to shuffle off to the latest,
hottest XP grind spot for their level by implementing an overkill
transportation system?  Or is the cure to retune content so that whatever
your destination is, you'll probably find people there?

Or could it be worse...could it be that the world is TOO BIG?  Maybe
some server consolidation is in order?  I don't necessarily think I know
the answers, I'm just asking the questions.

Similarly, not everyone wants to grind their way to level 65, either.
They would rather buy characters that have already been leveled to 65.

It's a rather beautiful, wonderful, good thing that people don't always
get what they want.  If they did, life would be much less fulfilling.
