If you can, try to up the memory to at least 256MB to compensate for
the processor. Looks like EQ up to Velious will run okay, with many of
the bells and whistles turned low or off. My desktop computer is a
Pentium 2 350Mhz with 256MB of ram. I don't dare even attempt to bring
Luclin into my house, for fear of my poor sad little computer self
destructing.
