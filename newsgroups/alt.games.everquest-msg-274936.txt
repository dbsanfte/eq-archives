This isn't just for my server.  I figure that on every server there are
people trying to improve this faction.  Whichever server you're on,
come on out and get faction.  Group up with whoever shows up.

The faction comes so much quicker when a few people are working
together.  I would guess 4-5x faster.  I've done a lot of time solo out
there, but it's so much better when someone else is there too.  My goal
with this is to have a time when all us individuals will know that
there will be others out there too.

So this isn't *my* event to get *me* faction.  This is for anyone
working on Dranik Loyalist faction.
