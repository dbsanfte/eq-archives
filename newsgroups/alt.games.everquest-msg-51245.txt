I am a lv 10 rogue on Drinal. So far I have found 3 rogue quests and they
are all puny exp paymant and item wise. If anyone has any rogue quests from
lv 10 and up but below lv 30 please tell me. Sincerly Durus, Rogue, Drinal

I can't think of any level 10 quests that give you anything but "puny" items
and experience, if you've been playing EQ for more than a few months and
have regularly seen better stuff.

The only quest that I can think of for a pre-50 rogue that drops an item
that MAY not be considered "puny" by you is the Burning Rapier...a weapon
that really isn't all that good, considering the time & trouble taken to get
the stupid thing.
