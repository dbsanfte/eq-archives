I didn't bother to argue because ultimately it's a matter of opinion,
not something really worth debating, and extremely unlikely to change no
matter how many heartfelt posts are made here. However, I've played
since beta and quite like the books now. Granted I've done the boats and
cross continent thing enough that the sense of adventure has long since
been replaced by a sense of tedium, to the point where I often put my
characters on autorun across the Karanas or Dreadlands and went and did
something like make a sandwich while doing the runs. Back when Kunark
came out I played a druid in an uber guild and the number of runs I had
to make across the dreadlands to karnors to port guildmates back to
emerald jungle after wiping to Trak were more than enough to lose any
slight interest in crossing that zone ever again.

Personally, I think people who want adventure and the chance to explore
will find their way just fine, dispite books, while the people who just
want to get someplace will probably find a shortcut like a druid port or
whatever anyway. There's still lots of places the books don't go and
people still seem to go there a lot so I don't really see the big deal.
Norrath and other old content may seem smaller but try raiding umbral
planes and vex thall, or ToV sometime. There's still lots of places that
are a decent run from the nearest port in or book for those wanting
adventure.
