    Fact for your pulling pleasure: a mob with secondary aggro (you haven't
engaged it, it aggro'ed off another mob being aggro'ed) does not spread
aggro. This is how people who are non-KOS can pull King all the way to zone
in Chardok. Pacify his guards, mez/root a mob beside him so the King has
secondary aggro and not primary aggro, and run like hell for zone keeping
him outside aggro range but inside chase radius. Well, you need a rogue to
keep doors open, too. ;-) You can use invis in much the same way.
