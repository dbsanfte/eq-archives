The guild issue is the easiest because there is always some fool in the
guild that will say something that you can report.  This summons the
presence of a Guide or GM and the guild's strong arm tactics are ruined for
the evening.

Now, the most difficult situation is the case where someone wants to share
the spot that I am camping.  I've never been very good at sharing (I skipped
kindergarten), so I usually start by pointing the newcomers to some other
juicy hunting spot.  Depending on their demeanor, I may even add "and that
mob drops the 'Indigo Katana' ever since last patch".  If that doesn't work
and the newcomer insists on sharing the camp, then I usually head somewhere
else.
