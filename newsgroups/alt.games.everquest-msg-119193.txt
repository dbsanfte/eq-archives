   If this newsgroup were limited to only "valuable" post then the traffic here would
be much, much lighter, my  blue friend.  
   I don't really like Blackburrow for the reason of the incidents you describe.  It
is a newbie dungeon, and is populated by either true newbies, or experienced players
playing alts.  The newbies may do things you describe out of ignorance, but IMHO the
real trouble comes from the alts.  These people often tend not to care about the
lower levels, and cut whatever corners they possibly can to help them on their way to
whatever their target level is.  Not all, of course, or maybe even most, but enough
to make being around a concentration of them unpleasant at times.
   Oh, and you will see alot of Barbs in BB.  Unless they get a port, they pretty
much HAVE to go through there, and many choose to fight there as well.
