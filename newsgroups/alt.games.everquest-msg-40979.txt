It is the truth. The can do absolutely nothing immediately if they do
not have evidence. Even a /report is no garauntee. The response
generally means the will be doing an invis investigation if they've
had more than one complaint about the same person. But, if the person
doesn't do it again, there's not bloody much they can do. Would you
rather have Guides/GMs suspending/banning people on just the word of
one player?

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
