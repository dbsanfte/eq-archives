Hmmm, I would have to disagree on several points.  A feudal economy?
I don't see it.  Truly it's not a pure capitalist economy either but
to call it feudal is an extreme view of certain rare aspects of the
game.

I agree that Sony is adjusting the economy as we go but for reasons
that are outside of monetary considerations for the most part.  Most
of the Lore and NoDrop stuff was to try and balance the game more.  To
their credit, SoE is trying to make a balanced game where everyone has
the same even ground starting out.  Obviously this is not possible
because people will twink new characters they start but SoE at least
tries.

Btw, I'm no SoE proponent.  I think they seriously screwed up with the
Verant acquisition and the corporate decisions post acquisition, but
that's a different rant.

I think several of the things you mentioned also have to do with the
realization that the resources are infinite, and they are compensating
as best they can.  It would not be possible for them to limit the
world quantity of plat to a specific number.  Well, it would be
possible but now you're moving from an enjoyable game to a masters
project.
