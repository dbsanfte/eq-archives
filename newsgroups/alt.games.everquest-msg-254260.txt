I'm leveling up my chanter using a 65 beastlord.  The chanter is currently lvl 
54 and I'm in Nadox killing the undead since they are the highest mobs in the 
zone.  The hot spots show Nadox as being from lvls 50-55 and Hate's Fury as 
55-60.  Does this mean that both zones have increased exp for lvl 55 
characters?  So when I ding 55 I could be in either zone and get better exp?
