I never see it mentioned, but always check with merchants! I picked up a
Fungus Covered Tarmok Staff (30DMG, 40DLY) plus other stats for 6pp from
Shady in the tunnel in EC. I also saw a Centi Warspear on the same NPC
for 7pp one time, but when I returned from the bank, it was gone..No
surprise there!
