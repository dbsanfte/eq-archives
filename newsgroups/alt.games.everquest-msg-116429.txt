I'm going to hazard a guess here, your highest level character is in the
mid-30s, and you're trying to make money off HGs, but can't get to any
because of higher (45+) people being there and killing faster.

You're an idiot, everybody pays the same $12 a month, you may not like what
they do with it, but they do have every right to be there, just like you.
If you can't grab the HG as soon as it spawns and kill it, then somebody
else will.  Also, HG's can still be light blue up to 52 or 53, so they ARE
getting exp.

As for saying that "they don't need the p[l]at, they just WANT it", you're
an idiot, just because you're level 53, doesn't mean you don't need money
any more, hell, most of my (50+)friends have a hard time getting money
anyways and cringe every time I tell them how much I spent on my latest
upgrade (3300, 4000, 15000 for my last 3 big purchases, and I've never
farmed HGs except to see if I could kill them back in my mid-late 30s).  My
2 druid friends that I offered to pass on my ES arms to at the cost(2k) that
I paid for them back when I bought them a month earlier, they both jumped at
the offer, and they both had to scrounge junk off alts to try and afford
them.

So, to reiterate, you're jealous of their ability, and you're a moron who's
mommy must have let him eat ice cream for dinner every night, and you just
can't stand that not everyone bends over backwards so that Ken gets what he
wants, when he wants it.
