More stuff coming out of Luclin.
*sigh*

Looks like Xev's uberguild was the first on our server to go into
Acrylia Caverns and take down the undead warmaster. Apparently dropped a
pretty nice piece of headslot all/all gear.

Here's a picture:

Crown of the Undead Warmaster
Slot: Head
AC +25
+15 to STR, DEX, STA, CHAR, WIS, INT, and AGI
+100 HP and MANA
+5 Save Fire, cold, disease, magic and poison.

Not too shabby. The MOB gave them quite a bit of trouble, apparently, so
I'm guessing this is a pretty serious encounter needing an uber raid
force since these guys do ToVN regularly.
