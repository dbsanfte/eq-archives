This has come up in another thread, but I think it may be worth bringing 
up again... Does the fact that the xp curves have been flattened mean 
that people who completed lvl 45 before the patch eat all Hell levels 
*plus* longer, harder levels after 45?

It's purely anecdotal evidence, but xp in 48 is going much, much slower 
than it did on 47. I'm pulling a constant stream of blue Bloodgill 
Goblins, with no downtime and no deaths so far, and progression seems as 
slow or slower than it was on lvl 45. Anybody else noticed something 
similar?
