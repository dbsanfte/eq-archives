A lot of debuffs do no damage (druids does, i cant really think of others
tho).. but root>mez because some mobs in HoH are flagged unmezzable.  How
else you going to deal with that 500hitting add?

be hasted and have an add smacking me in the back

Root > heal because heal means agro.. means mobs (adds) smacking you,
preventing you from casting that long duration big hp heal..   altho these
kinda work in conjunction... root the mob, then you can heal big

Debuffs are THE MOST critical thing in the start of a fight (think statue
when hes a challenge, rumblecrush etc).. but once these land, slows, big
heals, mez, root all become THE MOST crucial spells in order to raise your
success chances..
