Guilds are formed for a variety of reasons.  Some are formed as friends 
and family type guilds.  Some are formed as serious raiding guilds.  Some 
of them are formed to allow the guild to accomplish things that the 
individual could not, which includes things like quests and raid level 
mobs.  There are plenty of low and midlevel guilds out there still.  
Likely not too many serious raid guilds at that level though.  If what 
you are after is finding more people who are also interested in doing 
things like completing epic quests, then you can easily find that in any 
number of family and friends type guilds.  If you are looking for serious 
raiding, you need to level up.
