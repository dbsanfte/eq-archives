Never claimed to be anything more than an armchair political scientist.
Libertarian to boot so really despised . Opionions are like assholes
everyone has one, and incidently I stand by mine :p If you disagree with it
say so (you dont seem to have a problem here) and then back it up with
evidencce if you feel like it.

My evidence for the decrease in rent can be found at clarkhoward.com

My evidence for an incompetent governor in california can be found by
observing mr greyout himself. Supporting evidence would be that he is now
desperately trying to break contracts he signed when electrical power was
expensive. Additional evidence can be found fairly simply by doing a google
search at google.com on such key phrases as califronia electrical crisis.
