Yes, because that post wasn't updated after I made a deposit.  They told me
to look at the new post.

> And a third.

Yes, because after I paid my car payment I looked for a new post and there
wasn't one.  They told me to check the original post because it had been
edited and updated.

> And a fourth?

Yes, because now I have two or three different posts to check and I'm never
sure whether one of those will be updated or a completely new post will be
made with my current balance.

The people in the pub don't care whether I can find out my account balance
or not.  Doesn't stop me from complaining over a beer because my bank is
doing something stupid.

Didn't take many.  But then I kicked the guy's ass, because he was the one
that told me to use that bank.   =)
