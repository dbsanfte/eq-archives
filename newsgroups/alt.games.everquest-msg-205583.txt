I'd disagree here for two reasons:

1.  Damage cap at lower levels.  A high damage weapon will not do more 
damage than a lower damage weapon, unless both are under the damage cap.

2.  Best ratio weapon will ALWAYS win out in your off hand (barring 
damage cap limitations).  An 8/16 weapon is ALWAYS better in your off 
hand than a 30/70 weapon.  (you should really compare (dmg*2+1)/dly on 
the weapons rather than straight ratio.  So 17/16 vs 61/70.  Over time, 
you will do more damage with the faster, lower damage weapon.  You won't 
see the cool to look at high damage hits, but, the mobs will die faster.  
Of course, at level 17, given the damage cap, you won't see much 
difference in the amount of damage per hit regardless.  One other 
consideration is procs on the weapons, they can affect the overall damage 
done, and agro generated.

Are you talking about the ranger epic swords?  Swiftwind and Earthcaller 
I think.  Both are one handers, and meant to be used with dual wield as 
it is.  One procs a slow, other has haste or procs haste I think, not 
sure, never looked into it very seriously.
