I am thinking of starting an "evil race" character.  I've been looking over
stats for Ogres and Trolls.  The thought of a Troll seems cool, as I don't
see them much.  However, it seems like Ogres have them beat at everything,
hands-down.  Maybe this is why I don't see many of them???  I realize they
have regen but is it worth the slowest experience accumulation in the game?

If I do start either Ogre or Troll, should I just stick with warrior or are
the physical aspects of either worth the low wis/int for either shaman or
SK?

Personally, I wish I could make a Troll Bard.  Not only would this be cool,
but would most likely resemble Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead.

Sean...
