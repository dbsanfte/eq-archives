You're talking about the client.

I'm talking about the CONTENT which you do NOT own.

At best, you own the client (you don't, but let's pretend you do).  You 
have no rights at all to anything at the server end.  None.  Zero. 
Zilch.  You never signed up to any rights, you never entered an 
agreement to posses any rights, you have none.

If you use *anything* from the actual everquest game then you are 
breaking copyright law.

What software?  You bought the server?  And all the data there-in? 
Nice, how much did it cost you to license that from sony (you know, like 
  Ubi-soft did for a while).

You don't want to find out your breaking copyright law so you're 
ignoring the most fundamental tenant of it.  If you bought Doom, the 
game, and you then released a mod, and that mod contained the original 
artwork, you would be breaking copyright law even if you only gave it to 
your friends for private play.

It's not your content.

> work to a new, private use, is copyright infringement

Stop using the word private, it's irrelevant.  You either have rights to 
copy something or you don't, and you don't, no matter what the intended use.

> you only say that because you assume i'm doing something wrong

No, I'm not assuming anything, you're refusing to admit you're doing 
something wrong so you can justify you actions to yourself.  You're 
morally decrepit if you steal copyright material.

> then tell you that you can only use that product the way they say?

Because you agree to that when you signed up - if you don't like it - 
don't sign up.  I make a choice every time I sign an EULA.  If I break 
that agreement, then I'm morally decrepit.

Yes, that is *exactly* a breach of copyright.

> think about that and answer me ... where's the copyright violation?

You copied material you had no right to do so.  You own the physical 
media and you own the right to watch it, but you DO NOT OWN THE RIGHT TO 
COPY IT.

It's called Copy Right for a reason.

I'm done, you refuse to admit the truth because it doesn't fit what you 
want to hear.  Go read up on copyright law, actually read the words, 
take it in, and then come back.
