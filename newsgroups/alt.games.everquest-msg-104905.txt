Damn French... it couldn't possible be my fault! Ok, I couldn't resist.

Anyone who has ever been addicted and managed to kick the habit will
probably tell you the kick to kicking their addiction is taking
responsibility for their own actions (as well as getting help if they can't
kick their addiction on their own). So you're right... ultimately, only one
person is responsible for your actions... except maybe the French.

Just my 2cp worth
