I tend to see much more randomness when equivalent-level mobs dispell me 
than exp blues or raid mobs.  The randomness also seems to favor picking 
off lower-level buffs.  There also seems to be more randomness the higher 
my MR is.

What I think happens is, each type of dispell has a number of buffs it can 
strip, and possibly a cap on how far down it can go.  So it starts at the 
top, and each buff in turn tries to make a resist roll of some kind that 
involves mob level, possibly my level, the buff's level, and my MR.  If 
that buff passes, it goes on to the next buff.  If that buff fails, it's 
dispelled, and if the dispell can strip more buffs, it goes on.

Raid mobs generally all my buffs will fail the resist check, so it takes 2 
or 4 off the top as appropriate.  Exp blues I have a good chance of 
either resisting completely or losing the first buff, and a low chance of 
it going on.  Right-about-even mobs seem to have the best odds of 
stripping a buff here or there.

But most junk buffs are pretty low level, and seem to have real good odds 
of going first, luckily.

But I could, of course, be entirely wrong about how it works.  Tough thing 
to parse. :)
