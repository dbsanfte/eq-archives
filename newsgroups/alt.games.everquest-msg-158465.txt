I don't know... but I have a few suggestions :)

- The Scarecrows from the field in West Karana will invade Quenos. Will drop
precarved pumpkinheads.
- Sand/Forest/Hill Giants carry around a HUGE pumpkin.
- certain NPC's will give you a treat if you say "trick or treat" (how about
a hearty meal called "pumkin pie"?)
- Skellies will roam all zones - even the ones that never had skeletons.
