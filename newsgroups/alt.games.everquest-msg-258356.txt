Well, they could have changed the tables, but they probably didn't realize
the simple way to do it.  They probably thought that, in order to keep
people from having sudden changes in XP, they would need to do a big
database update all at once.

They seemed at the time to be a bit afraid of anything that had to write to
the database outside the game, so it is not surprising that they went with
an on-the-fly bonus to counteract the differing tables, rather than fixing
the tables.

However, there was another way.

    1. Change the tables.

    2. Add a marker to each character that records whether or not the
    character's XP has been adjusted.  This could be done by creating a new
    faction, which is something they did know how to do safely, so no scary
    database stuff required.

    3. Put a check in the server whenever a character enters the world to
    see if the adjustment marker is set.  If not, the server can give the
    character an XP adjustment to bring them to the right point on the new
    table, and set the marker.

This is much less scary than an out-of-game database adjustment, since it is
all stuff that the server is doing anyway (faction tracking, giving or
taking XP).

Speaking of databases, does anyone know what EQ is using?  The rumor is
that SWG uses Oracle, but there is no particular reason to believe they
would necessarily use the same one EQ uses.  The only other game that I've
been able to find out about is DAoC: they use MySQL (and their servers are
running on Linux) (they were going to use Oracle...but the cost of the
license was 60% of their *entire* budget for the project).  (And the rumor
is that a lot of the early problems in SWG were because of the cost of
Oracle--they bought a license for a certain capacity database, and they
really needed more, but it would cost a lot more, so they had to make do,
and it showed).
