I said warrior was better DPS.  And it is, undoubtedly.  But that was a
simple question and now you've changed it to a more complex question.  The
answer is still simple, it's just the other option.  For 3-boxing, the
paladin is a much better choice.  Unless you want just the simplest possible
character (possible for somebody wanting to 3-box) the paladin provides a
considerable amount of utility.
