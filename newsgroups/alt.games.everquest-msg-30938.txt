Been mucking around in Befallen looking for the Moltor spawn to get the plat
ring.  I understand that the spawn point is at the entrance and to kill off
anything that spawns there in the meantime.  Is there any other trigger or
do I just need to be more patient?

I've read the horror stories on the web already for the length of time it
might take - I just want to confirm there is no other trigger....

Thanks!
