Oh, I know.  My druid was my primary for about a year before I fell in love
with my enchanter.  I bought a second account and had the enchanter
transferred over to it (before they started charging) because the few holes
that druids have as casters are neatly plugged by the enchanter, and
vice-versa.  My druid was also the character that did all the non-no-drop
quests for all my characters...how can you beat that?

It's easy to hate druids but it's based on envy.  Some of the uberguilds on
Zeb are starting to realize that, hey, you can't exactly snub druids,
because at EVERY SINGLE LEVEL druids have something to offer...if NOTHING
else, TRANSPORTATION.

In experience groups (playing my enchanter) I'll always pick a druid over a
ranger unless we have NO tanks and need one (which is rarer than tanks will
admit to).  As enchanter I really love shaman, but if I had to pick, again,
I'd pick a druid.

And druids are better soloers than any other class in that they get to pick
where they want to fight and be there within 15 minutes, and more likely 10,
and possibly 5.  This comes in very handy if you go to your favorite spot
and it's taken.  NO biggie, just pop over to some place 3/4 of the world
away and try there.  Mages and necros, while CERTAINLY fun to play, don't
have this option unless they have a pet taxi...and let's face it, probably
the majority of necro primaries don't have that many friends.
