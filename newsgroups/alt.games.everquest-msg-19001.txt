I just had a little look at this software. All I can say is wow. Any player
who uses this is at a VERY distinct advantage. You know those hours and
hours players spend waiting for that rare spawn? Or those mobs that spawn in
random locations? (I should mention that I'm too low to experience either of
these time wasters but you highbies talk about them) well now you can see
immediatly the level, class, hitpoints, loc and a nice map showing it all to
you.

If only I'd kept my Linux laptop =)
