For a 65 wiz, you could go quad gargs in Plane of Nightmare.  They drop alot
of diamonds and blue diamonds... in a session of xp there at 56 I would get
about 2.5k.  Fairly high magic resist on them though... might take a few
tries at snares.

Personally, I have 2 spots that I make cash from. 1 is king in seb... takes
awhile but fungi sells well.  Second is the sewer in Cazic-thule.... Boots
of flowing slime are about 100k on my server ;)  You could probably handle
CT as a wiz.
