You were caught just deal with it. Be happy they suspended and didn't
ban and because "everybody" does it, they decided to go easy on you
with a suspension this time.

And having read their site with all the "potty mouth" text from top to
bottom, over sexed observations about female NPCs, no wonder our guild
is only upper level and not uber. If it takes this sort of membership
to be "uber", we'll never make it. :-P
