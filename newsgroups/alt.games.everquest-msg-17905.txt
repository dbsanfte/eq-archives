So be careful out there all you
> potential Goo hunters! This dungeon can be a right Beyatch on wheels.

Its not that bad . All caster mobs are grossly underconned because they both
hit like warriors and can cast spells . The ones in dalnir are no worse than
any others . The trick is to keep your resistances above 100 especially
magic resistance . The mobs dont actually hit harder or have more hps than
they are supposed to for their level. To solo this dungeon below level 50 or
so (ie. farming for loot ) you need to have exceptional resistance gear, or
be able to buff same . A standard 6 man group of the appropriate level that
includes a bard and a priest class could also handle it . BUT this is the
reason that dalnir was so underused that they had to add exp bonous and it
is still not as bad as kaesora or droga/nurga.
