Looking through the plethora of information in EQLog and found an
interesting stat.  The listing of the num kills per level.  Now this isn't
separated into cons, just the total number of kills you had while at that
level.  I found the range (post level 10 upto 16)  to be from as low as 93
on up to 163.  It didn't increase with level, so that means I was pretty
efficient at some levels while not too efficient at others (don't do many
quests, so kills are my primary exp gainer).
