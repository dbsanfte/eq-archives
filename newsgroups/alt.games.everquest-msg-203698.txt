First off, damage shield potions use your characters level to determin how
much damage they do So it wont do much damage at level 1 and probably won't
be worth it.. I dont know exactly how much damage each one does per level,
but im sure that the 62 shammy that posts here will, being as most decent
shammies are alchemists =P
Secondly prices vary per server, so depending on how nice your local shammy
is, depends how much you pay for them.
For things like this in the future, try some of the EQ reference sites.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com
http://www.everlore.com (shite imo)
http://eq.crgaming.com
http://www.eqtraders.com
http://www.magelo.com
http://www.eqprices.com

There are also various class specific sites, im sure some have been posted
around here from time to time.
