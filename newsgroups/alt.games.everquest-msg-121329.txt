It was probably an old message, or someone talking of something they did a
long time ago.  The EQ server *used* to send your faction value to the
client whenever you /con'ed something, and then the client figured out what
message corresponded to that faction level.  A few months ago, that was
changed so that the server just sends a number that tells which faction
group you are in.
