Chain Smoker... I've gotten sick to death of you
coming over to alt.talk.creationism and harrassing
us, and obsessively following me around the newsgroups.

As I've said, if that's how you get girlfriends?
Your technique isn't working.
Go buy it in the streets.

You're scaring me enough by your insane behavior, I got
up with somebody who knows a whole lot more than I do,
about tracking people's usenet history... you can
change your screen-name, but the address didn't lie.

I was told by somebody alot more experianced than myself,
at tracking down people on Google Groups, and they said
to run a check on Chain Smoker's address...
and I lie not... I found this DISGUSTING post in his
background. CHAIN SMOKER... ARE YOU A HOMOSEXUAL...
I WOULD NEVER LET YOU AROUND A CHILD!

YOU ARE A PERVERT.

Big dicks?  You got to be kidding.  There is absolutely nothing big
about
these cocks! What fucking world are you living in?
