What classes other than Monks get Dual Wield, and at what levels?

And do the weapons have to be the same type? In other words, could I use a
blunt weapon in one hand and a slashing weapon in the other?

(I have a L3 Monk, but he fights with his hands; I'm going to two cracked
staffs when I can afford them)
