Trying to balance my time in GoD from exploring the new zones to
poking around the ship in Abysmal sea. Unlike previous expansions, Im
really trying to get into the lore and story and really "consume" this
expansion. ITs been interesting so far, and Ive talked to tons of
NPC's in Abysmal and have enjoyed the story aspect of it (I literally
laughed out loud when I saw the guy kicking the box around below decks
on the ship).

One thing I found were the progressive tradeskill quests. Essentially,
these are quests to jump start a tradeskill for free up to 54. Most of
mine were already well beyond that, but my smithing was still kind of
low (which i really need to raise in order to finish the Thurg shawl
quests) so I started the smithing quest.

This process is kind of novel but I wonder WHY they are there. Getting
any of the skills from 0 to 54 isnt very expensive at all (even for a
newbie) and not very time consuming. Doing it now with this free way
seems to take far longer and only saves at most... what 100pp if that?
Do these lead to far better things - quests/new recipies etc? Is it
actually worth the time to do them?
