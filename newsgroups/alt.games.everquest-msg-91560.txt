You will only get the stein if he talks to you and gives you the quest in 
full. If you just go ahead and give him the book, he'll eat it. There are 
a few quests you can do to raise faction, although when I did it as an 
enchanter, I didn't need any. Illusion: dark elf and one cast of Alliance 
did the trick.
