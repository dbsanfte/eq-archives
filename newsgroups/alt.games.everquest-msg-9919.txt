Not like you would know, as you have never honorably served,
furthermore, the prison or Service options went away in the 30's with
the exception of the marine's who did away with it in the 50's.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when

apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
