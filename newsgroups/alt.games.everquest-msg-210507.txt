I haven't technicallly had it resisted, but I remember on one occasion
tracking down the black unicorn in WL and finding a pint sized unicorn
(aka someone else had used it as a pet and shrunk it). I was the only
character  in the zone, so it wasn't currently a pet. I cast Dire
Charm, got spell did not take hold message, ran away with an angry
midget unicorn trying to fear me.

In other words, it's best to not try DCing a shrunk animal.
