It was a military vessel in international waters, not engaging in any
hostile action.  How did the Isrealies know they weren't engaging in hostile
action?  They jammed the Liberties signals.  That requires close knowledge
of the Liberty and her frequencies.  They knew what the Liberty was sending,
especially since she couldn't send anything (ECM wasn't as advanced back
then as it is today ... and before anyone asks; no... I don't know, no... I
don't want to know, and no... if I did know, I certainly wouldn't write it
here).

Not only that, but the fact that they knew how to jam the Liberty's radios
meant they knew what ship it was.  This disputes their claim that the U.S.S.
Liberty ( http://ussliberty.org/g/0016.gif and
http://ussliberty.org/g/0033.gif ) was mistaken for the Egyptian boat, the
El Quesir ( http://ussliberty.org/g/elquseir.gif ).

Yes, we do.  Isreal ensured that the Liberty -couldn't- share information
with anyone.  Four of the five radios were jammed.

Anything could have the potential to cause harm.  That potential, alone, is
not enough.  Even so, Isreal's attack was sufficient to say that they
regarded us as an enemy combatant, thus declaring a de-facto state of war.
We should have responded in an appropriate manner.

The reason was to cover up the activites of their war.  There are other ways
to do that than killing the witness.  Basically, the Liberty saw too much.

I've got eight years under my belt, EQ.  They may be as an enlisted, but
they don't count for less.  Yes, there were reasons for Isreal doing what
they did.  There are also reasons why a gangster would kill a witness.
Neither are legal.

Attacking a neutral party is an atrocity.  http://ussliberty.org/g/0048.gif
Those are three of our sailors under those tarps.  Sailors on a ship that
wasn't involved in that war until that day.  That's an atrocity.

Obviously, there was a lack of communication.  None the less, the way to
deal with a lack of communication is not by shelling a ship for over an
hour, gunning down stretcher bearers and fire fighting teams (a tough enough
job as it is, believe me), and destroying lifeboats as soon as they are
thrown in the water, then radioing the U.S. Embasy and calling it an
accident.

True, it's not terrorism.  Each of the thirty four men killed
(http://www.ussliberty.org/casualty.htm ) were combatants.  None the less,
they were neutral.  That's what removes it from the realm of combat to a war
crime.

That was the very reason for their attack.  If they did not intend to cover
it up, and kill every survivor, they would not have attacked in the first
place.

We're not claiming terrorism.  We're claiming an act of war.

Even that does not justify an attack on a neutral party.  Something like
that should have been dealt with by a call to the embassy to ask for a
withdrawl.  The U.S.'s response to the attack should have been to end the
war with the U.S. as the victor.

That is not justification.  They are military proffessionals, responsible
for their actions.  You know right well what would happen to you or I if we
screw up.  They made a calculated decision to attack a U.S. Navy ship when
we were not at war.

Reason to believe did not exist.  Isreal knew everything we were sending.

When dealing with neutral parties, you _must_ take those into consideration.

It would be an act of war, and Russia would have justification for launching
a counter attack.

We understand the acts perfectly well.  None the less, they are not
justified by the reasons.
