What, you mean like my Wiccian friend who wears the emblems of his faith
openly?  Yeah, his job's in jeopardy, let me tell you!  Oooh, how about my
friend who just got a promotion, her Wiccianism sure hurt her!  Please, said
religious discrimination is rare these days, and usualy actionable.

Here's something to chew on.  How does the fact that it occasionally happens
elsewhere justify it happening to christians?  Is it ok to discriminate, as
long as the right people are discriminated against?

> Wanna talk about religious discrimination?

Please do.
