CannV is sweet you really should get it ASAP. IE: when you get your AA dont
waste them on other skills just get your MC3 and then get CannV and youre
golden. The only thing that sucks about it is that it eats 2000 HP when you
cast it so +HP items are very important, you should start buffing up right
now. My friends shaman alt just got it and she has 1900HP unbuffed and its
hilarious (if not a little sad) when she uses it unbuffed and dies.

RS3 is very usefull because it works indoors. With the introduction of the
shrew spells Im sure that isnt so great any more for a shaman im sure. The
only thing about general points is that unless its runspeed, metabolism, or
regeneration it isnt worth getting with your first 6AA. Dont waste them on
stats.

When your shaman is level 60+ you can PL your friends as easy as pie and not
have to worry about a thing. I would not suggest going full AA untill at
least 60 or even putting it up to half untill 55/56. The amount of AA you
will get per hour per day will increase dramatically once you get tier 2-3
flagged (lv58 and 62 respectively).

Advancement in AA is equal to the amount of experiance it takes to get
through level 51. As you start fighting things that are higher and higher
level you will get much more AA experiance per kill. Thus it is slower to
advance in AA at level 51 than it is to advance in AA at level 60.
