Just got my fear whip and starting to look to trak. Some in my guild are not
seb keyed so I volunteered to help them get their keys (naturally). It seems
that the forager cycle is no longer spawning in TT. I used to farm that guy
for almost a whole L60 looking for an Iksar mask (got it), so I know how the
spawn is supposed to work. Did they change it or is it broke? This is on
Saryrn server if that matters.
