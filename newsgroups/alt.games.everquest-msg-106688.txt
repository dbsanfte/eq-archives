Depends on the mob and the zone. But I'd say that even without the other
two, a necro wizard combo could kick ass on lower dark blue mobs in the
fifties quite easily. I mean, they can both solo at that level, and
adding together the combined capabilities of the two classes, I dont'
see why not. The rogue would be of more limited use, but if the necro
was fearing everything, I guess the rogue could just keep backstabbing.
Problem is, if fear wears off/is resisted at the wrong time and the mob
aggros on the rogue, they lay out some nasty damage at that level, and
rogues don't tend to remain vertical very long under that type of
assault.  Of course a post fifty wizard can shorten a fight like that
quite a bit. ;-)

I hear ya. We had to CANCEl a raid into the Hole to go try for another
shaman and ranger epic piece. We were waiting for nearly two hours and
only got one cleric, and never did get a chanter or a bard. Taking
twelve people  through the city and down to Jaheil with one cleric and
no crowd control when most are low fifties is suicide. I Called off the
raid in disgust and went to bed. :-(
