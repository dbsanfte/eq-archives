If that idiot gets YOU killed then the experience debt is good.  A bad
tank can quite easily kill a healer and vice versa.  But either way I
do see that it would put some people off grouping with strangers - not
a good thing as your group of acceptable people to group with will
increase very slowly (if at all)

That would be easy to prevent by only sharing the experience debt
between players within a certain distance of the dead guy.
