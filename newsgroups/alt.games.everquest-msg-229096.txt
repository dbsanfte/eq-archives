My target rings looked fine before & after the patch.  My find path,
which was weak before, is now no longer visible and only a sparkling
effect lights the way.
Seeing it proper on my other computer it looks like the sparkles were
supposed to be in addition to the path.  I'll have to look harder next
time to make sure its not just really faded.

I don't have my exact driver, but its from 3 or 4 months back.
