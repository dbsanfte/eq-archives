early levels a high damage 2hander will be sweet, once the pet can
dual weild, then give two high damage 1handers...
Be aware.....   Delay has NO effect on how pets use em... Pets will
always swing at a pre prescribed delay no matter what the weapon says.
At some point giving your pet a weapon has no effect, due to their
Inate damage will be better than the weapon.

sorry, have no idea here... my necro kills what ever suits him at the
time..

/pet back off I belive is the command...
Be aware, if you have pet setup on Guard, and he gets engaged with a
mob, when you pet back off he walks rather slowly to the guard
postion..  If pet is on Follow you, and you do pet back off, he will
move at a faster pace to you (unless he is right next to you)...
