Hehe, i have quite the opposite experience with Dreadlands. Karnors Castle is
located near the FM zone line, so if you park your druid butt near that
place, and then port people, you can earn a lot.
Most people needing ports from there pay 50pp for a trip to WC, more for the
more desolate areas, 100pp for EJ is not uncommon.
Have earned my most porting money there, when i was waiting for a guild buddy
to show up for a port.
True, you have to run a little, usually a 30 sec run from FM zone to Karnors
to do the port, but for 50-100pp a port, who cares about a 30 sec run.
