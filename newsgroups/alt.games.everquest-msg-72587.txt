I have two stories:

 My main is a 48th level cleric.  I'm waiting at the Druid ring in NK.
I then notice one of the druids attack a Pally that wandered nearby.
I quickly volunteer to rez the guy, since I'm bored, and I'm just
waiting their for a lift from a guildmate for a raid.  But I ask the
guy shouldn't he consent me so I can drag the corpse because it looked
to me like he was KOS.  He assured me that he wasn't and that what
happened was he attacked a wolf near one of the druids and the druids
attacked him.  I said ok, never heard of that happening before (Druids
in WC don't behave that way, and never saw it happen before).  Great.
I rezz him, heal him, and buff him.  At that point my friend the druid
shows up to gate me to the raid but we are both low on mana so I sit
down to med.  Stupid wolf attacks me, and next thing I know, I'm being
pummeled to death by a druid, hitting me for 300+.  Was dead real
quick.

2nd ALMOST resulted in a TPW,. but actually no one died.  Stories like
these are always better when only the stupid are punished,, but in
this case we all (barely) got away with our lives.

 I always have macros for my heal spells.  Key 1 is for Cel heal, 2,
is for Greater Heal.  On the rare occasion when I decide to have
Complete Heal up, it's in the 3rd spot.  I had just installed EQ on a
brand new PC after Luclin, and had to recreate all my macros (not too
hard -- I didn't have all that many).

So my first key slot had a message to the group saying 'casting Cel
heal' on target, followed by  a /cast 1,  and so on.  I recreated the
macros from memory.

Only problem is that for the Complete Heal spell, I put in  a /Cast 3.
I never keep Complete heal in the 3rd spell slot -- it's always in the
7th.  I knew that when I memorized the spells, but forgot it
immediately when recreating the macros.  I had the macro set up for
over a week I think, before I ever had a need for it (as I said, I
rarely cast Complete heal - Cel heal is quicker to cast, more
efficient and as good as you need in most situations.

When the time came where I needed it, I coulldn't read the message on
the screen because things were scrolling by too fast.  If I had, I
would would ahve realized that I was casting Retribution on my
groupmates instead of Complete heal.  I must have cast it 3 times in
one real bad fight.  Fortunately no one died, and Retribution costs
significantly less to cast.

I even petitioned to report this as a bug.  By the time the Guide
responded, I had completely figured out that Iwas an idiot.  Guide had
a good laugh about it.

Fortunately, I had a backup healer in that fight and no one died.  But
We almost all died (had we not had a backup healer,, we would have).
My friends beleived me when I told them that Complete heal was broken
-- except for the backup healer who told me that it was working for
him.
