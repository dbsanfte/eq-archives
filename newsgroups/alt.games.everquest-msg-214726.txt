Half Elves in EQ have never been a good choice for a minmaxer, they
get infravision in exchange for crappy stats (as opposed to, say,
Wood Elves who get infravision, hide, and forage in exchange for
improved stats).  Frogloks are kinda lame in that regard, basicly
Half Elves with better stats from a game mechanics point of view.
