You can uber-twink at level 1, you just have to avoid being stupid about it.

First off, YOU WILL DIE.  Take this into account.  Don't give your newbie
barbarian warrior full crafted and a pair of yaks, run him to Misty
Thicket, and start fighting without getting bound.  Run him there, get a
bind, THEN twink.  And don't fight someplace that you can't get to quickly.

You'd think people would not have to be told this.
