They both do the same thing, which is to cut down the amount of mana you
expend on each spell cast by a certain percentage. They are focus items.
The only difference is that MP I will only work on spells up to level
24,a nd the MP II item will work on spells up to level 44. To get them
that effect on spells above level 44 you'll need to find an MP III item,
or get a mage to summon you one.
