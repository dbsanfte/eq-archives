In crushbone we killed the trainer, I am the enchanter.  I won the
roll on the shiny brass shield.  This is the kane bayle (1 week old at
the time) server so this is a sought after item.  I offered to sell it
for 6pp (the cost of one of my current level spells) to any of the
melee in the group.  I was told in private tell, that no one would buy
it from me because they were offended by me participating in the roll.
 NBG, you understand.

Why is distributing loot fairly amongst all that participated (which i
did) considered greedy.

I think the NBG concept should be labeled MBF (Me before Fairness),
since no one really needs any paticular item, and excluding people
from a chance at the item is not Fair. And no i do not whine when i am
one the other side of the fence.  I do offer the stuff i can't use at
a reasonable rate though, and appreciate when other do the same.


So i gave the shield to a cleric freind!
