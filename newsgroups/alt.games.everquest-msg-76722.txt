Beastlord pets will take a weapon and equip it/use it.
Its just that you can't see them equip it.

It is the same with mage monster summon pet... you just don't see it
equiped on it.. but watch the the damage its slightly higer.


It appears to to me that BL pets are very similar to the mage monster
summoned pets.

Oh and BTW, as far as I have notice with both my 53 mage and 19 BL,
pets can equip and use just about ANY item in game... but   can't make
a item proc like a levitate ring, it has to have a auto proc like
sword of runes


I usually bring my mage to my BL and summon up a full suit of plate
and elemental defender, blanket of the elements, lev rings ( for the
AC) and coldstone.. (again for the AC)
So far as yet haven't notice a  ecumberement penality for pets yet,
tho that don't mean they don't have one
