http://eq.castersrealm.com/creationguides/skills/default.asp?class=Shaman

For Max point levels for each level the general rule is (Level*5)+5. so at

level 1 you get (1*5)+5=10
level 2 you get (2*5)+5=15
level 30 you get (30*5)+5=155

There are exceptions to this rule (Monks get (level*7)+5 for double attack I
think)
And for TradeSkills (Jewelcrafting, tailoring, etc) this cap doesn't exsist.
You can have 200 skill in tailoring at level 1. Only exception to this would
be Shaman Potion Making which is (level*5)+5

You have to watch your skill increases to know where they are at. UNTIL it
reaches 101 skill level and it is then shown on your skill list in game.

Couple websites that I like.
http://www.everlore.com (Only think Can't stand is pop up banners... dam the
person who invented them)
Http://eq.castersrealm.com (Favorite personally)
http://www.allakhazam.com/
these three should in of themselves solve most of your questions. some
answers ya have to dig for tho heh
