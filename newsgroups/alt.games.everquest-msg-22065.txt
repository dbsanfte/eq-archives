Nope, it's unlikely that that would be considered an exploit. No bugs
are being abused. The orc behaves just as it was intended. If you'd
found a pathing bug that allowed you to stand in one place and burn
away while the orc never was able to move close enough to touch you,
that would be an exploit (pathing bug. Root/snare doesn't count. Just
cutting off the smart-asses ahead of time)
