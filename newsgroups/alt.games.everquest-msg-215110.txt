I hear ya.... Ive been playing for almost 4 years and have gotten used to
the beggers which are most commonly found in Bazaar & PoK these days. I've
found that most of the "Plz Kidz" are under age 14. Often you are dealing
with an 8 year old playing their brothers account. Its something to keep in
mind before you tell them "where to go". They dont have the patience,
attention span, or skills to play the game.  I pity them. And also they
don't have the maturity to read and understand a post like yours - or direct
tells trying to explain the same thing. They've found it more profitable to
beg then to actually play and wait for that high level to come upon them,
for that drop to drop. The only way to prevent the spread of the "Plz Kidz"
is to not feed them.

Plz dont feed the Kidz.
