>According to the manual:

BZZT! Never never never believe what you read in the manual as being
'gospel', particularly regarding some of the hidden aspects of the game.

Dex has been parsed to have a very slight effect on proc rate, and
people also say it has a slight effect at how fast you learn weapon
skills. Neither of them are noticeable, even in large dex jumps.

Ignore DEX, ignore STR, ignore AGI over 75, get lots of AC, lots and
lots of AC. Once you reach 1200ac, start swapping out for +hp and +STA,
once you hit 1350ac, go fully targetted on sta/hp
