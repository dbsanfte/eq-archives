I'm under the impression (perhaps wrongly) that if you filter them in
options, they don't get logged, so for those of us who like to amuse
ourselves by parsing our logs, that's a big minus.

I use two combat spam windows on my characters (plus two chat
windows), one for other characters and misses, one for my hits and
hits on me.  That lets me see if I'm getting hit, and how much I hit
for, and still have everything logged.
