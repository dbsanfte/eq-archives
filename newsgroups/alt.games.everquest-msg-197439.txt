Regardless of which account, on either computer, when I zone into
Western Wastes I am immediately dumped to the Server Selection Screen.
And all subsequent attempts to log back in, yield a 1018 or being
dumped back to the SSS.

I know its not the toons, cause ive had a freind log in ppl from both
accounts successfully in WW.

Its curious cause it manifested itself on both computers at the same
time.

I've deleted the zone, and its maps from both computers, and repatched
them both.

Any hints or thoughts are greatly appreciated.
