That part of the portal system never went live.  There are such pots in
several cities including Ak'Anon, Qeynos and the one  you found in
Neriak.  They do not, as some have surmised, lead to the portal room in
Tim Deep though,  they predate Kunark and are actually left over from
beta.  The one you found leads to Crushbone as I recall, the others have
similar connections which lead from one part of the original world to
another.
