Most people aren't going to volunteer to pay for something they can get for
free. Somehow, you've got to come up with a diplomatic way to let people
know that you would like some reimbursement for the dots you use buffing
them.  Don't push it if someone says no, but  I bet a lot more characters
than you think would be more than happy to give you the cost of the dot.  If
you don't want to go that route, perhaps you could spend some time in PoK
casting Temp for donations.  That may not be how you want to spend a few
hours of your time, but it may help ease money problems.
