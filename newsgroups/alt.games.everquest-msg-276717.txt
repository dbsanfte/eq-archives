Hmmmm, I want to look into this. Will be off work tomorrow until next Friday 
night. Woo-hoo!!

So, could you tell me what anaglyph glasses are and where I can read 
about/purchase them on the Web?

Is the special Nvidia driver you refer to below in another post something 
that makes some kind of difference in the display on a standard CRT monitor 
or does this driver require some kind of special hardware or glasses that 
you wear?

Enquiring minds want to know!

Thanks. And thanks to all for the interesting discussion here about the ways 
and means you approach 2 boxing with. I am definately looking forward to 
giving it a try.
