I'm a 47 druid who sort of skipped vellious; my first experience was porting
to icelclad, being mass mobbed by dervishes, dying, then trying to figure
out how to get to my corpse without having the experience repeated... now of
course i have the GD port and the iceclad portal is pretty much unused.

I've been looking at the shawl and ring quests, and really wanted to get
involved with improving my faction, but it seems like i'll get no xp if i
kill giants, and besides, they don't seem to be that easy to isolate (or
perhaps i just show my ignorance of the zone?). I was thinking about
powerlevelling someone else up in gd so that even if i don't get xp, i'm not
totally wasting my time. My guild is too weak to go raiding (they are very
excited by crushbone) and changing guilds seems a drastic solution.

Any ideas? Can i get xp from giants or are the ones around my level
impossible to root/dot without loads of adds?

I tried asking another guild if they'd just let me help them during a war
there, but they weren't interested... i don't know if there's a rule against
healing a player against their will, but i wouldn't be surprised! ;-)
