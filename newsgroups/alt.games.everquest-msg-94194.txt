Hi,

Thanks to a lost body I am in need of equipment.
I managed to scrape together some miss match items to get me throught
30, but now safley into 31 I need to check out my wardrobe.
I am a 31 halfling druid.
I have about 750pp at the moment, but can quickly grab some more via
ports.
Current equipment sucks apart from a testement that I stole off my
cleric alt.
(By sucks I mean that I have no earrings or rings !)
I exclusivly solo and am looking to increase my mana / wis, but still
have some AC.
What should I buy / hunt / quest for ?

Also I have SoL, but I have not been to the moon yet.
What are good places to solo at 31 and any suggestions for pull spots
etc ?

Cheers,

Jim
