At lower Lvls I would not use the clinging darkness to solo. You will cause
a big train in seconds.

I would recommend going in and taking the two guards to your right. There is
another guard to the left of the zone but around the corner there is a guard
that is in the argo range of the first guard. At your lvl it is likely that
they will con Black to Yellow. I would wait until there are a few people in
the zone, at the zone entrance to help you in case things get out of hand.
(It happens quite easy in the Warrens.) What I suggest is that you camp the
Kobolds that are at the tent by the Wizard spires and not try the Warrens
until this small camp becomes trivial.

I will say that last night I made 20 pp in one hour there. The loot is Phat.
The lvl 8 mobs and higher will drop bronze weapons worth 1 to 2 pp and Soft
Wicker armor worth 2+ pp to venders. I do know that Druids and Rangers of
low lvl like the Soft Wicker Armor. (It looks like leather but is green in
color.) Was selling extra Soft Wicker to Rangers/Druids for about 5pp per
piece.
