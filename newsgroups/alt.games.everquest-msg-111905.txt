I'm just done receiving a Vex Thal file update... Is anybody far enough 
along the VT key quests to justify Verant pulling their finger out about 
this zone?

I'll most likely never find myself there (heck, never been even to Umbral 
Plains), but I have to confess I feel very curious about what this zone 
has to offer.
