Conceeded point.

Again, however, EQ is supposed to be a group game.  The only
bad thing is it's not ALWAYS possible to get a group, so the only
option left is to find something else...tradeskills, bazaar, auctions,
or <gasp> soloing for xp.  When you can solo efficiently for xp even
though you love grouping, it just adds another dimension to the game.
Without some pretty decent gear, most melee classes cannot
solo _effectively_.  Killing one blue mob in 10 minutes is not
effective soloing, while killing 4 blue mobs at once (or one yellow)
every 5-6 minutes is good experience.  I ran through 52 in a day
with my alt rogue because she could single pull a room full of
very specific blue-to-her-mobs, fight down to win and heal with
her Mrylo BP back to full to keep up a rate of about 4 mobs every
7 minutes or so...without the Mrylo BP, she'd have had to bandage
up to 70% and then heal up to full just so she wouldn't die fighting
the next blue.

Efficient solo power may not be the most important thing for
a druid player (ne Celaeno <waves>), but even she'll admit that
it's possible if she wanted to do it occasionally.  Same with one of
my alt's guildleaders, a necro...he spends 90% of his time raiding
or grouping, but can also just go clear out a dungeon full of blues,
get to the bottom, and gate out when it's time to log for the night.
Heck, if I had some sort of gate item (I was really pissed before
Luclin came out...the GM wouldn't even talk to my main because
he wasn't a wizard...a rogue with that Nexus portal necklace would
be fun ;-)  ), I actually would probably spend more time solo
just because the xp is better...it's just too dangerous if things
go wrong.
