You have just made my point, although, I think, unintentionally.

I believe the level system of societies (and guilds) is intended to inspire
team work and generosity. Only if members think beyond "What's in it for me
right now?", will a society prosper.

Basically, I love this idea, but because of the way tradeskill societies
have been designed, it's virtually impossible to build the necessary team
spirit. When you do work for the society, the only recognition you get is a
"Thank you!" from an NPC. As in real life, generosity should be rewarded
with recognition and gratitude from the community.

Guilds have a chat channel, a web site, special raid quests, and what have
you. When you announce a successful completion of a writ quest people cheer
and express general satisfaction. That's all the reward I need as long as I
sense that everybody else is also trying their best for the guild.

Tradeskill societies have an instanced place to go crafting, that's all. You
don't even get to know the other members, because there's nothing to
encourage conversation with the couple of other guys hanging around. When
you do need to speak with other crafters, they're from other branches, and
therefore from other societies.
