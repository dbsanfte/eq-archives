Just means that your newsreader is automatically wrapping.  The standard 
for usenet is 72 (I think) characters per line.  Some newsreaders will 
automatically wrap posts that the poster failed to format correctly, some 
will not.  In my case, it does not, and, thus, I don't bother to read a 
post that is not wrapped, not worth my time to scroll across, and too 
lazy to change newsreader settings for someone who is unwilling to 
configure theirs properly.
