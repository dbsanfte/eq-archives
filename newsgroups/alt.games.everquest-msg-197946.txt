Iksar in Dulak (and probably anywhere else you can find 'em in LoY) also 
drop it.  I hear there's an entire ship of 'em somewhere in there, though I 
haven't been bothered to check into it much.  You may need to bring a group 
if it's one of the higher level ships.

From what I hear the iksar in SoNH and WW do NOT drop blood.

Only iksar blood I've ever seen was on a vendor in gunthak, and i quickly 
snatched it up ;)

Lemme know what you come up with.  I have a few vials of tae ew blood left 
and plenty of sarnak and froglok blood (about 3-5% drop rate on froglok 
blood in FV, and plenty of 'em, btw).
