Right and I work for Santa Claus.

That message wasn't for my benefit or any other players. It was a push
by VI/Sony to get the numbers to a record high.

No, it gives them a great advertising tool when they launch Planes of
Power. I wouldn't be surprised if they print "Join more than 100K
people online at the same time!" on the front of the box.

"REAL" VI/Sony employees have already stated in print that the
subscriber base is larger than 400K. So now I know for a fact that you
do not work for VI/Sony, based on your false statement above..
