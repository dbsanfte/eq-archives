A few months ago in Eastern Waste, I was at the Ry'Gorr fort when I saw our
servers most-uber guild leader duel and kill at least 20 players in about a
minute total.  I suspect this was for the same reasons as posted above.   Is
Sleepers Tomb a no port area too? or where they doing Kael or something?

Orlun, 3rd level Rake, Xev

PS, the guild leader was nenja (60 rogue) and I swear I saw a death message
at least every 3 seconds.  Was awesome to see but now I realize it was
probably naked casters he was dueling.
