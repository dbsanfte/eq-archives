No, I just think your full of shit.   When I have a guild ranger pull for me
in PoP, he does a damn good job of it.  Better than any other class IMO
(bard can offer more by staying at the group for starters).

If you think rangers are such shitty pullers, maybe its a problem with YOU.
I see what skilled rangers can do, and its damned good.

Lots of tips here if you ever wish to ask and learn about pulling.

Think about it /wink
