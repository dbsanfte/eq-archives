I learned some languages after i ran into a nice gnome that taught me. 
Now im trying to get the rest of the languages, but the rare ones are 
hard because noone knows them.
Problem with learning others is that i can do better stuff the 20-30 min 
it take to learn someone a language, and 15pp at level 48 dont exactly 
make me interested. So im stuck with the problem that i know almost all 
the common languages, and a few rare ones, and noone knows the rest i need.

I have mastered the following:
Erudian
Elvish
Tier'Dal
Troll
Ogre
Thieves Cant
Combine
Dragon
Elder Dragon
Darn speech
Gnomish

The last player languages are easy to get, got average or more in those, 
but the damn gnoll, fairie and such are not to be found.
So hope i run into someone someday that wanna learn the rest, so we can 
sit and bounce the skill increases back and forth untill were both maxed.

And it DO have some purpose:
Guild meetings, in my former guild we did them in troll, less risk of 
someone to listen to us, not many trolls in Toxx.
Sometimes people (usually troll, ogre, de) speak in their language, or 
in Dark Speech so noone can understand them. Funny to listen in and see 
what they say, and maybe start to talk in the same language too to see 
how they will react.
