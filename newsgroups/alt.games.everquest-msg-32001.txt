(Mmm, more thread drift!)

I assume you're running an X server then? And probably going with
the default window manager? I don't know what that is on RH 7.1,
but it's probably GNOME/Enlightenment, and that combo is a memory
and processor hog of the worst kind. Try switching to a lighter
window manager, or run it like it's meant to, bare bones CLI.

Of course, changing window managers might be a non-trivial task
for a beginning user, dunno how easy that is with RedHat's admin
tools, and I sure can't recommend doing it manually...
