Basically a Pally 40 and above is a backup healer that can do some decent
damage. You will never have the damage output as a warrior or even an SK.
But your greatest assit is Lay Hands and Heals when your Healers are out of
Mana or in Trouble. Unfortuneatly The Paladins role above 50 is very limited
and not in big demand an FBSS and wurmslayer combo is good but have invigor
ready you will need it Wurmmies drain sta big time.
