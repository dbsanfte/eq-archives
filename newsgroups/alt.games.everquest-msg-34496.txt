    Yes. Most of the "odd" forages in Kunark (Water Reed in LoIO, Ice
Crystal from DL, etc.) can be put in the water extractor with a purification
tablet that was added to the merchants a few months ago. When combined, one
gets a flask or two of "purified water), same stats as flask of water. The
purification tablets are Lore, so this is no good as a water source. My
speculation is that the "Iksar cultural pottery" that was promised HOW many
months ago will require the purified water.

    And for those that like to bash VI, this is a great thing to key on. The
purifier was broken for what, eight or ten months? Then, when they finally
DO fix it, the only use for it is in a skill that was also promised months
ago, but never delivered. Unless purified water was needed for an otherwise
broken quest. See - there ARE things other than Alchemy. ;-)
