I used to overpay in EC because I just didn't want to go to the trouble 
of researching items on Ally's only to have to sit and /auction for days 
on end waiting for someone to sell at a price I could afford.  Plus of 
course I'm still unsure of how to 'price' the stats of something.  Now 
that the bazaar is up I never, EVER buy something over 100pp unless it's 
below 'market value'.  It's so flipping easy to play in DSP and just 
check in at the bazaar during log-in, camp-out, why bother paying more?
