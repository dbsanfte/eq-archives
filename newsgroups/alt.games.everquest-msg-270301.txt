A "group" flagged encounter is, always, considerably harder than a
"solo" encounter of the same level.  If you have a solo encounter of
six green con mobs, you'd probably have to be really bad at your class
to die to them, If it's a green con group encounter, then depending on
class and level it may or may not be possible to defeat them, but no
matter the number of mobs, it will cost more power and hp than a solo
encounter would, IME.  I see no fuzziness, except in the confusion of
terminology between a group of monsters and a group flagged encounter,
which are completely unrelated things.  Using "linked" or something
for multiple mob encounters is better, it avoids this confusion.
