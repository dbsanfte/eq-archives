LOL the guy that used to draw her quit or was fired 
whateveryouwanttobelieve.  While I never liked the fact that a half-naked 
high elf was the spokeswoman for the game, at least the earlier pics of her 
weren't too far into the realm of pron.  At least when I started playing 
she was something I could aspire to look like (no comments on my frumpy 
haus-frau frame). She has since evolved into a character I can't relate to 
at all.  Come on, any woman would freeze to death in that outfit and that's 
not the least of my problems with her.
