The problem with AoW is you only have a split second to FD, before he beats
you into a pulp

Im not uber by any means, but the difference between my gear/HP and "uber"
monks HP is only a few hundred hp, and when you think the AoW can hit for
1000 or so a pop, thats only 1 hit more (so its not just me/my ghetto gear,
its a pretty general statement)

Saying that though, I've managed and seen other monks FD him off.

Vindi is the bastard who I can never FD off, once he turns on me im dead..
guaranteed.
