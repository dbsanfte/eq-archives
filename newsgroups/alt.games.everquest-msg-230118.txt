Oooh!  I did this quest way back when Luclin first came out - back when Peqi
was camped 24x7.

And the really funny thing is... I did it for the Shimmering Mace.  =)  I
already had a better back item and the meditation mod did nothing for me.  I
ended up selling the Cloak for some nice plat.  In fact, when I auctioned it
(this was before the Bazaar was working and before you could link items) I
got several tells asking me if the Cloak was real - items that modified
caster skills were relatively new.

The Mace, on the other hand, gave me a nice WIS bonus, and being a human
cleric I was way behind the curve on getting WIS maxed, so every +WIS item
was like gold to me.  And, at the time, there were darned few items that
offered better WIS in your PRI slot.

Nowadays, of course, the Mace is very passe.  Heck, at level 56 you can cast
Hammer of Judgement that gives you a decent PRI weapon:  14/18 AC 10 Dex
25 Wis 5 HP 35 Mana 35.  Even if you never melee it's a nice stat item.

As for the Cloak itself... the meditate mod is going to be mostly
meaningless.  When I got the Cloak I had already maxed out meditation, so I
gave it to a ranger friend to test regeneration.  Without the cloak, it took
her seven minutes forty seconds to get from zero health to full health (with
no KEI or anything).  With the cloak, it took her seven minutes six seconds.
So the difference in mana regen is negligible.

If you're looking for a slightly easier if more annoying to quest back item,
try the Aegis of Life:  AC 12 Wis 10 Disease 25.  It fits on both your SEC
and back slots and give a nice WIS bonus.  And even if you do find a better
back item, it's still nice to have in the bank if you ever need to bump up
your Disease resists.  The quest is pretty simple:  camp a spot in South
Karanas for both the living and undead version of Lord Grimrot.  The
annoying part is that it's a four-hour spawn, and the Grimrot spawns are
uncommon, so often you just get a skeleton.  What I did was to bind myself
near the spawn point, then use the spires in NK to go somewhere else and do
stuff, then gate back when the spawn timer was due.

A nice alternative to all of that, if you have the plat, is to get someone
to make your twink some crafted armor.  A typical back item is a Salubrious
Heraldic Cloak:  AC 16 Wis 15 HP 40 Mana 40.  The price on Heraldic items
has fallen through the basement because of ornate armor; you could probably
get a cloak like that for 20K.  Recommended level is 45 but even at lower
levels the stats aren't bad.

It's not too bad; move forward in AR until you get to the fallen pillar and
camp that area.  I was lucky; back in the day AR often had a group there,
and I sat at the zone line until the item dropped and traded two stacks of
peridots for the item.

That's the primary reason to do that quest; it's fun.  =)  The conspiratists
have some very mildly amusing dialogue, and you get quite the sense of
satisfaction from getting the items.  These days Peqi is up all the time -
he used to be the bottleneck for the quest.

The quest is a bit of a timesink, though.  You can buy better stat items,
depending on your plat.
