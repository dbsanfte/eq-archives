Sounds to me like you are talking about Call of Duty, and I will completely
agree.  This game is so much fun.  Makes you feel like you are truly in the
middle of a war, and yes the AI is very good, there are a few missions where
my "men" have taken out targets better than I could.  I'd recommend buying
this game to just about anyone.  I'm not even a huge FPS fan, but I had so
much fun playing through this game, so far around 3 times, and playing
through it again now.

Great fun, great diversion, great tension release.
