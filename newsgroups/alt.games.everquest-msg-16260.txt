And in another message, you write:

If that is true, I'm shocked that you don't recognize the common thread
between the two examples you give (everquest and a casino):  ADDICTION.

The guy that lost all his money in the casino is an addict, just as the
person that plays 10 hours a day at EQ compulsively.
