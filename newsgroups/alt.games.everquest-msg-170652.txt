Not exactly true. I had my little 16 gnome mage in The Warrens the other
night. I was pulling blue shamans, pack elders, protectors, and sentinals.
When I got shaman spawns I'd sic my pet on a nearby green, and the shaman
would heal like crazy without engaging.  Eventually it would stop and my pet
would kill the green, taking very little damage. I could then pull the
shaman and the pet would eat it with it casting maybe one spell during the
entire fight.
But in general mobs, especially high level ones, have so much mana, and when
not agro'd count as meditating (think of a PC caster on a horse), that it is
usually a very important to get the mob agro'd and off tanked, or mezzed, as
quickly as possible if he's helping. High level mobs can virtually heal all
day without running dry if they are not agro'd but not because they use no
mana. To give you an example of how large mana pools are, I can sieve myself
out of mana (53 enchanter) in like 5 casts, but I had a white con mob heal
nuke me after I mezzed it and dropped 10 mana sieves on it (plus a Theft of
thought).

Anyway on the original topic, mobs have 4 ranges they deal with. Agro range,
which is the shortest (the radius at which they will come at you). Assist
range, which is usually a bit bigger. Helping range, where they heal and
buff, but don't agro, is basically limited to the normal max ranges of the
spells. Finally of course is 'chase range' the range at which they will go
after someone who is on their agro list.
