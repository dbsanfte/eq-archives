Actually, not at his level.   Up until 54, LDoN was still great experience.
It was 55 exactly that it declined remarkably.

Tier 1 zones have the added problem of finding stable groups.  Although I
did look, I was only able to find two tier 1 groups while I was within those
levels.  (55 - 58)

One group was at 56, pulling the PoD courtyard.   It was great experience
(everything was white / yellow to the whole group)...  gaining perhaps twice
as much as LDoN over a given stretch, as long as pulls continued.   But they
didn't.  It was the worst example of the "pickup group merry-go-round" that
I've ever seen.    We pulled nonstop for 15 minutes... then the paladin went
afk for 20 mintues.  Then the enchanter said "oops, gotta go, bye." and
logged on the spot.   The paladin who had been afk came back and logged as
well.   We had to spend time before we finally found a bard, but the bard
wasn't enough to slow much, and the druid kept running out of mana (was
holding steady for chain pulling while the enchanter was there)... then the
druid had to leave and we sat around at zone for 20 minutes trying to find
any healer to come.

While we were killing the experience gain was double the rate of LDoN.  But
after you added in all the time we spent screwing around trying to find
replacements for this class and that class and unable to pull because X
person had left...  it came down to LDoN rate or a little worse.


The other group was camping the yard trash at PoI zone in.  Without the high
level opponent bonus, it was the worst experience ever.   As slow as LDoN or
slower, and the most boring thing in the world.    And even being lower
level was not allowing us to whip through them, because they were just
hitting too hard.

LDoN was the only stable groups avaialable.  So, in the end, I did LDoN to
59 (and parts of 59) when I was ready for Valor.  Got a couple groups there
and finished it off.
