its so easy in terms of time and effort for iskar to get into Freeport. then
a human to get into Cabalis. i did it once with my Mage High elf. it took 13
level of killing in Loio to get not kos to the troopers and about 500 stacks
of bonechips to get not KoS to crusaders. im sill kos to the shamans but
there easy to aviod.
