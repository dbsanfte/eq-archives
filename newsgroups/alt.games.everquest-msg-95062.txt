The answer to that is that druids have always been the most popular
class in Norrath on all non-original non-split servers. (though
warriors show a slight lead usually, its well known that warriors want
their level and location known, while many druids don't.)

If they are so popular (and they are), Verant can safely assume that
they are fulfilling their role fine (maybe even too fine) and
therefore don't expect any bumps to the druid class, it doesn't need
them.

It's a simple concept - if you wanted to be a group god, you shouldn't
have picked druid. Too many people want their cake and to eat it too.
