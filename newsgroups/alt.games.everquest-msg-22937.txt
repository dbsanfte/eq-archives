I will defend my home territory, sort of. Feerot is too dark and a nightmare
to find your way around in, but it is a good zone to get your first few
levels because you have vendors in the same zone as lizard camps. Since
Shaman get SoW at 9, there is really no reason for people not to be SoW'd.
So... unless they were in Oasis below level 9 or were nothing but casters in
the group it should not have been a huge problem.

You don't even have to leave Feerot until about level 14 or so.

On the road to Oasis.

Leaving Feerot <or Grobb> you get into Innothule Swamp which is another nice
low level area. The entrance to Upper Guk is crowded with low level
froglocks who drop netted armor and rusty weapons.

From the Swamp you get into South Ro. SR is IMO one of the most underused
areas in the game. Zombies, Ghouls, Dry Bone Skeletons, etcetera, even Sand
Giants. It has Orc and Dervish camps galore, none of which see any heavy use
like those in the commons.

So the only reason to go to Oasis was for power leveling in the percieved
best zone in the game for PLing.

This makes them a lot less sympathetic IMO. I mean if someone was training
SGs across zones *into* Feerot then they would have a point. Specifically:
Were they prevented from leveling? The answer is a resounding no from this
corner. They were looking to take advantage of the fastest place to level
and wanted to get this bonus w/o any interferance.

I'm reminded of that lake with an indian name that losely translates to "You
fish on your side of the lake. I fish on my side of the lake. Nobody fish in
the middle." That is what Oasis should translate into common.
