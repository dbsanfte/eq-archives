I wonder why there aren't sanity checks in the server to catch things like
that?  E.g., the server should know the best loot (in terms of plat drops,
or stats on weapons and items) that the designers *think* they put in, and
raise an alarm if anything drops that is better.

That would have caught the Crushbone thing, and such classics as the Moss
Covered Twig when Kunark came out.
