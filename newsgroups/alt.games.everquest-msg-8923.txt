    Cry me a river about your pet, druid. I'm a cleric. :-(

    I wish I had a pet like yours, that could at least farm faction. I met a
druid in Crushbone that had somehow managed to screw his faction in PoG
before doing his epic (sigh, they'll let anyone be a Heirophant these days).
He hadn't even thought of using the bear because he thought so little of it.
