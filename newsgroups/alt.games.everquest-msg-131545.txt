     wow, this is a new one on me, sort of

     nothing worse than using old drivers with new hardware, in this
instance using the VIA AGP VGart driver from the original IWill KK266 CD
with the newest nVidia driver, nada, nope, won't work. Once I installed the
newest VIA AGP driver it works like a charm

    never assume anything

    thank you  10 ^ 24 power
