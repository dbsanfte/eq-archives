It seems a few older quests have been broken when DoN went live.

Cast #1: my group were helping a wizzy epic in KC by killing Venril
Sathir.  Many of the people, myself included, have done him before and
usually are a pushover.  My brother once duoed him with his 60 shammy
and 60 SK when 60 was the max level and did it fine.

Today: we had a terrible time and wipe.  2 70 cleric went OOM healing
MT and nearly every nukes and dot were resisted.  The only thing that
landed without resist were malo but that didn't help the other
resists.  Plus the mob had insane regen and went back to 100 a few
seconds after the last surviving tank went down.  I was chain casting
pet summons to give a 58 cleric a chance to camp out before I died.
We all were upset and very positive that Venril was either overtwinked
or broken in some way.

Case #2: a week ago my group were in Howling Stone just for fun and to
get Hand of Glory key.  5 hours later we were still stuck in the north
wing because the damn named mob that drops the key to access the west
wing never popped.  /bugged it and next day my friend told me that HS
was bought down for bug fix.  Haven't been there since then.

Case #3: twice I've failed LDoN missions (both collect on normal)
because we never collected the required numbers.  In both cxases we
were able to kill every single mob and none was left in the entire
zone to drop the needed items.  No more collect for me!

There's also rumor that Jboot quest is also broken as well.  If you
have experience in either Venril kill or Howling Stone and could check
these out, I'd appreciate it.  Better yet bring in a full raid force
for Venril.  I just need to kjnow if it's bugged in other servers or
if it's just Vazaelle.
