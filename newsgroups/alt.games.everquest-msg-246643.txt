Its great as one of only about 3 well geared clerics online. I *loved*
time when we got into adhoc untimed no order complete heal rotations
and stuff. But yeah, 'farm status' raids are tedious.

Even Quarm is still up if I can convince my melee not to avoid the AE
and fight through it. Keeping everyone alive and cured and stuff without
running out of mana... I love it ;)

You'd be surprised. In aggregate people are still vital, although it
might not feel that way individually. And theres the fun of the company
and working well as a team.

*can* start. But you can solo to 65 too. To progress after 65 + AA's are
done raiding is all there is and for the 'Ooo I want to be the baddest
on the block' types rather than just 'Im as happy raiding fear as time'
then theres only one place to go.
