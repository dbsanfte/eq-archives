The same exact thing happens with me, even with the in-game music 
running. If I stand still for too long the music stops or stutters until 
I start moving again. I tried adjusting the priority of winamp and EQ, 
but neither one helped. I'm not sure there's any way they can coexist 
peacfully! I'm running a p3-1000 with 256 mb of RAM on Win2k, by the 
way.
