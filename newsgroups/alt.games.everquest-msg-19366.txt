Perhaps I should have clarified that I was asking him only out of curiosity.
Far too many people who employ English as their primary (and usually their
only) language fail to do so in a concise, intelligent manner.  I have
studied another language for four years and I achieved only basic written
communication skills; trying to construct this post in French would have
taken me all day.  I well understand the difficulties associated with
non-English speakers and I feel it reflects very badly on Americans in
general that people who did not grow up with our language can so often use
it better than we do.

And no, my mom is not a crack whore, she does paperwork for my parents'
business and she is on the town council, thank you for asking.  If you want
to insult someone, insult me.  At least I'm here to defend myself, you
coward.
