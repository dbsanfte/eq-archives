I think there should be a high lvl warrior discipline called Behead. It
would give the warrior at most a 1% chance to end all fights with mobs
lvl 60 and up with a single blow and most importantly, leave the body.
An ability of this power would naturally have to be a final tier
ability, most likely requiring the warrior to be lvl 65 and have more
than 50 AA points to get that skill. I think that would give the long
abused warrior something to look forward to.
