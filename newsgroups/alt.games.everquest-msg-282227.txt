The exploit was for a gnomish catapult that was 6pp profit per
combine.  After setting up bots, yes some people made billions of plat
profit and sold it on-line.  Some guy posted a message about the
exploit here (and on multiple class boards) earlier, but didn't tell
what it was.  He did notify Sony though, and they fixed it a couple
weeks later.  I think some more account got banned.
