Um, Gygax and Arneson were partners for some time.  Tho they parted on
less than amicable terms, I don't recall any acusations of theft (and
a couple of the gamers I used to hang out with played in games ref'd
by Arneson).  None of us thought very highly of Gygax, but it was his
ideas we disliked, not the lack thereof.

All of this stuff is derivative tho.  And the myths and other stories
from which these ideas were taken/adapted were themselves derivative.
It's kinda the nature of the beast, people have been fantasizing in
one way or another for an awfully long time.
