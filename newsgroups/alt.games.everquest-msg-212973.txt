I've never heard that said about DoT's, but that's
essentially meaningless -- I never played a DoT
caster long enough to worry about it.

As a guess, rains were coded with the first wave as a
DD, the remaining waves as NPC damage, which would
cause the mob to poof.  So they 'fixed' it so it'd be resisted
if it had a chance to kill the mob rather than changing the
coding.  Now they've changed the coding.  I'm not sure
if they're any historical basis for the mob only poofing
when the rain caster was dead.

Rains are different in that they're individual DDs, each of
which can be resisted and (logically anyway) treated
differently.   DoTs are resisted once, AFAIK.  It'd make
some sense to handle the first wave as a DD and the
other waves as DDs cast by 'something else' since the
caster could be moving or even casting something else
when the other waves landed.
