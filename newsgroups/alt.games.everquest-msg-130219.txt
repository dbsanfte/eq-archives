You imagine wrong sir. Having both a 60 druid and a 57 monk I can tell you
hands down that the monk outsolos the druid by a wide margin. On the other
hand my 60 chanter puts both to shame for soloing. If soloing was important
this might mean something.

As the utility cleric (only 51) on my seperate account can attest to, most
of the time the main tank just dosent matter. However the bigger the mob the
more I would prefer to be healing a defensive warrior . I just wish the damn
meatshield would remember how to taunt just a bit more often :p
