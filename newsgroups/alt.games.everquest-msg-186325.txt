"It'll protect the same at the same skill from the same height always."

You say "always".  I give a concrete example otherwise, partly to point out
where you are mistaken and mostly to set the guy you were answering straight

where what you meant was perfectly clear because it's not convenient to your
current post.

My opinion of you climbs with every passing day.  =P
