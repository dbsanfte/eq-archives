 I must say thats a very astute observation for a 14 year old. 
Really! But.. as little as 10 or 12 short years ago a 770k disk 
was considered "big". 30 years ago (when I was playing around 
with mainframes) we had no storage devices.. we programmed using 
<gasp> punch cards or programmed directly into memmory, line 
after painful line through remote terminals. The storage devices 
then were huge reels of tape and our only output devices were 
<gasp> (very slow) printers and time used on the mainframes was 
extremely expensive. If I had only known back then, if I had the 
foresight and imagination.. Programming came easy to me back 
then, I really should have kept at it.

 Bill Gates (who went to school very near me and probably 
shared time on the very same mainframes I used), HE had the
foresight and imagination. He imagined very powerful CPUs,
input devices (hard drives) and output devices (monitors) 
sitting on people's desks like we have now.
