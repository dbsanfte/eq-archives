Let me say the fable on MS operating systems.  The NT class Microsoft
operating systems do not handle games very well.  The NT class is
meant for businesses.  WinNT and Win2000 are the NT class.  You are
lucky to have EQ running on Win2000 for 4 days.

Windows ME would handle games better.

But, I will never let go of Win98.
