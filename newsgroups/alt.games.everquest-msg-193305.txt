Mage/Cleric

My wife & I started a Cleric & Mage a awful long time ago, (Nov 2000??), &
we partnered right up to 62.  We took a 4 month break & just recently
returned.  A cleric never breaks a nail when they group with a mage!  We
were EXCELLENT partners, toss in some crowd control now & then & we did
pretty much anything we wanted.

We broke the cleric off to another account when my wife changed main
characters to a BL couple months ago, its now 62 & man do I got the AAs.   I
duel box the cleric & she slows with her BL & sends in her pet, good lord
are we powerful!  =D
