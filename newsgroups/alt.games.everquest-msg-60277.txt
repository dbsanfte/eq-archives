Or, if you don't have any use for a quest gem and want it to

Or, if you want to get involved in one of the more expensive in-game
hobbies like jewelcraft and have a reasonable chance of seeing a ROI

I make this post to remind people that guilds are like families in
another way, too. They only work if people come to them with the
understanding that their primary use will come from a pooling of
resources with *everyone* contributing and not just angling for what
they can get. And, not to get too newagy, but that's how you get the
most out of them. Just like you get far more game advancement in
groups after a certain point in the game than six people could do
individually, you get far more metagame advancement in guilds after a
certain point.
