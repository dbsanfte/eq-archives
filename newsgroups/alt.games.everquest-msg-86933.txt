From what I have read on the eqtraders board, they were quite well aware of
what is involved in failing the combines, and yet still said that was the
better route.  I am not trying it that way, as I have some interest in other
high level tailored items as well, and, as I may have mentioned, I have the
other major prerequisite for becoming a tailor in EQ, I am a masochist.
