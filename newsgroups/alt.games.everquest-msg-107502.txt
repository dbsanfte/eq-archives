Sure, I'll quote it.

/ooc:  This channel is designed for not having prolonged dumbass 
       conversations.
[Dan's Imagination, Chapter 7, Verse 53]

The interesting thing about this definition, of course, is what very 
subjective terms 'prolonged' and 'dumbass' are.  Almost as subjective as 
the 'excessive' and 'inappropriate' appearing in Verant's rules on zone 
disruption.

The basic problem is, some among us feel that inane chatter is good, in 
that you meet people you otherwise would not have, and others feel that it 
is inherently offensive to ask a question taking more than one response 
to answer.

So, here's my proposed solution:  We must create a new zonewide channel 
called /inane.  Or /blather, maybe.  Then all the people in the second 
group will know -exactly- which channel to turn off, and everyone in the 
first group will be able to have their random, meandering conversation.

Somebody said 'take it to channel! it bugs me!' Ok, so say we take the 
discussion to 'PvPdiscussion' channel.  Now, we want other people in the 
zone who may be interested in joining the discussion to know about it, 
right?

So every few minutes, the original complainant should expect to see

Oocer says, Out of character, "Come to the fabulous discussion on PvP 
we're having in the channel pvpdiscussion, password letmein!  At the 
moment, we're trying to figure out ways to hit each other with a Tome of 
Discord.  If you have any ideas about that, we'd appreciate it if you 
joined and told us."

I think, personally, I'd rather just hear the discussion.

Of course, this in no way excuses the retardedness that seems to flow like 
water in LOIM, but there just isn't much that can be done about that. :)
