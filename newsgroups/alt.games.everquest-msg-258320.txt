Exactly right. I expect the same behaviors that I practice from others and
always accommodate them in others when I see them (e.g., the alternating
merge rule-of-thumb). For those people to whom none of this matters, there's
no loss and no gain. Everyone should be happy all around. The only ones who
are unhappy in this scenario are those poor souls who steam over the idea
that anyone else might be getting "ahead" of them. I bet these guys are
often the same ones who complain about "power players" in EQ. ;-)
