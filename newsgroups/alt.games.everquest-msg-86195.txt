Forgive an obvious-sounding question, but did you prime your 1hs skill by
putting a point into it when you first made to your class guild - hopefully
before you embarked on your long and glorious killing career?  All weapon
skills and 'Lelvel' skills  you will get as you advance should be primed
with 1 point to get them started.
This also is where twinkage can bite people.  I'm not sayin you did, because
I don't know, but folks who do hand off or hand down higher level armor and
weapons to newbie Alts will see slower progress in their skills - to the
point where it hurts them in their lowbie levels.  Found out once by
twinking a newbie paladin in full Blackened Alloy Armor, Velium Round
Shield, Ghoulbane (pre-NODROP), Deathwatch Sword, Orc-fang earrings,
Grotesque Alloy Mask, and a Black Alloy Medallion.  Guy could kill with a
look.  Owned the GFAY newbie areas. Dropped decaying skellies in one
hit...and that was the problem.  He wasn't swinging that sword enough.  He
also wasn't getting hit enough.  By 7th level his skills were:  1hs-6,
2hs-2, offense-7, defense-4.  He doesn't get much play anymore.  Wish I'd
sold that Ghoulbane before it went NODROP.
