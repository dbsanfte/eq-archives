Why not?  I mean, currently this is true, you can't stop a spell by 
ducking on a horse because you can't duck on a horse.  But I don't see 
any in game reason why you would be able to stop a spell standing and 
not while on horseback.

I'm guessing its because the /stopcast command actually makes you duck 
and unduck.

And perhaps that the inability to stop casting was part of the balancing 
assumptions for horses.

Pretty annoying though if you ask me, as when I first heard about 
/stopcast I was excited that I'd finally have a way out of spells other 
than moving the horse and hoping I'd gone far enough... and waiting the 
full duration; or hopping off the horse and ducking out.

I suppose you can now write /dismount, /stopcast, /mount... is there a 
command to resummon the horse?  Three second delay there though.

This, on the other hand, seems like it effects the balance for 
necromancers; one of the "costs" for FD was that you couldn't do it 
forever with your pet up.

Nice, although I'll have to see just how much, really currently the 
damage off a DS is pretty insignificant in most cases at my level; a 45 
point DS will take a long time to kill a 20,000 hp mob.

Grr, none of the mage heals?

Lowered cost on Black Steel is nice, although I don't have it yet, which 
probably means the cost to buy just went up.

I used mouselook for a while long ago, but eventually went back to 
keyboard for everything.  I don't think it was because of smoothness, 
though, so I doubt I'm interested in this change.

I have no idea what this Tutorial thing is.  Thought maybe it was 
something in EQOA!

It wasn't working before?  What does this mean?

Heh, they really are trying to push the idea that they are "listening", 
eh?  Well good on us, even if a lot of it is just a gloss, at least it 
shows they know we want some kind of cooperation.
