You will not evade me, runen@netcom.no (Rune Ness):

>Yes, if

>save her. A dead cleric isn't going to heal you ;)

If *any* healer starts getting whupped on, save them. Druids can end
up doing primary heal even at mid and high levels, and the average
cleric has tougher skin than a druid :)
And if the tanks won't listen to a call for med break.. don't heal
them. I often slap a regen on tanks for downtime healing, works
particularly well when I have a good partner. If a tank still insists
on pulling with less than two bubbles of health, it's time to look for
another tank.

>And if the cleric loots during a fight, boot her. Then tell her why.

Doesn't just apply to clerics.

You're the second other Norwegian I've 'seen' on EMarr :) (I once ran
into Benreddik Fyfasan :) Seen more Swedes...)
