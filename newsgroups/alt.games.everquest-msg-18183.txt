I HATE when people send me tells begging for buffs...Or hail me while
I'm running by. I had some snert chase me halfway through the EC
tunnel hailing me...I finally stopped and turned. "SOW, plz?" I turned
around and continued on my way. Naturally, I got tells about what an
asshole I was. I was trying to get somewhere. Silly me thought that if
he chased me down so long, it might be important...the fact he kept up
with me meant he was already SOW'd...He just wanted a "refresh"...

On the tells asking for buffs... I'll sow people who /ooc for buffs
politely... Same with people who ask in /say. Heck, I through in extra
buffs if they scritch my wolf-formed ears before asking. (happens a
lot, surprisingly. ;-) ) But butting into a conversation or whatnot
with a tell directly? Nope.
