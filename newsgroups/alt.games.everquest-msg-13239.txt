Clerics aren't *that* unsoloable, really - simple root & nuke tactics
work well up to the mid 50's, even on many non-undead mobs.  However,
exciting it is not - root/nuke/root/nuke/med/med/med/repeat.  I've done
it a few times when all else fails, but not for very long - just too
boring.  Root, atone, divine aura and of course self-healing mitigate
the risk factor a lot.

Of course, plenty of classes solo much better, but clerics are far from
the least soloable class around.
