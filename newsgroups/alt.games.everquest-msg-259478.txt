(long details snipped)

Thanks for sharing this info.  I only recently learned that
/autosplit is unfair this way.  Previously, I had heard the
explanation that it split "coins" evenly, with extras going
to the looter, but I thought it was still mostly fair because
I assumed what it meant was that the TOTAL number of coins
(of all four types) got added up, then divided evenly.  So
if the looter in a group of 3 players found 10 cp, 5 sp,
3 gp, 1 pp, that would be 19 coins, and each player would
get 6 coins at random with the looter getting whichever coin
was left over.  And I figured if that's how it worked, then
the extra coins were mostly in the noise, and the random
coin handouts would come out mostly fair in the long run.

But when I was two-grouped with a friend a few weeks ago,
he asked that I not autosplit, and explained why, and we
watched what coins we each got from the next couple mobs,
proving his (and your) point.  Since which I've turned off
autosplit and ask other MLs to do likewise.  (Which makes
my monk happier anyway. :-)
