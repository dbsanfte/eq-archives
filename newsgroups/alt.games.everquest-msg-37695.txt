 There are a lot of mobs already in existence that aren't soloable and
drop valuable loot. So I guess your argument is that any mob that
happens to be soloable should not drop valuable loot?

 But you're under the assumption that people are raiding CoM due to the
'Valuable loot'. If that means finishing epics then maybe you're right.
If that means the random drops such as Wu's Trance Stick then you're not
since those things are still easily soloable. I'm going to contend than
95% of the people killing Reavers and the Lords are after epics and not
the other stuff that is dropped.

 ? 

 I'm not really sure why that's there but OK.
