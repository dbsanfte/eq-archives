Connect the modem to the winxp machine. Put Internet sharing on the WinXp
machine. Make sure internet sharing is disabled on any of the other two
machines. Make sure there are no firewalls on the three machines blocking
each other.

WinMe and Win98 will not lock up due to sharing an internet connection. They
will lock up because they are old crap OS.
