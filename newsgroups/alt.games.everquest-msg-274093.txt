No, it's about you. I don't like shitbags like you who can't keep
their word (yet claim they're not dishonest, even though selling the
account is exactly that). I don't like people who profit off of other
people's property without the owner's permission. EBayers playing the
account is far down the list for why I have issue with shit like this.

If you can't grasp the fact that not only are you violating your
contract, but you're committing an act that isn't a far stretch to
call fraud (And I have every confidence that if and when it's tested
in court, it will be ruled as just that. You're selling something you
have no right to be selling, as it's not your property), you need a
dose of the real world.

Yes, you're a dishonest person. Suck it up. If you didn't want to be
judged, you shouldn't have put yourself up for judgement by posting
here. If you don't care that we're judging you, you wouldn't be making
such an effort to defend yourself.

You played the game, you got what you paid for, you're done. Leave it
at that and let the account go. It's not your right to recover some of
the money you spent. You paid for entertainment and you got it. This
isn't an investment that is supposed to return profit later.
