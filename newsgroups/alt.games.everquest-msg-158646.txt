As a higher-level rogue, I've been in the kill group getting close to
100% of the experience on a number of raids and it's NEVER been even a
half of what I could get while grouping, usually more along the order
of 10%.

I, for one, welcome the changes. The XP was never worth the resentment
of people who imagined we were getting a ton.
