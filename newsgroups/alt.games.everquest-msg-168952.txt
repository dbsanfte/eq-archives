This has come up before and hashed to hell then.  I am one of many
whose experience with NBG in pick-up groups of strangers (i.e. not
guildmates and not long-time friends) is that the person(s) demanding
NBG are greedy scammers.  This includes melees who quick dump that
LORE haste item on a mule so they can come back and claim NBG again
tomorrow.  NBG was unfair to casters in a lot of places, and on my
server you just don't see it in pick-up groups because of that.  So
why should NBG become the rule of the day now when it would be unfair
to melees?  If you know who you're grouping with, and there is a pool
of people who play "can and will use" (better description than NBG)
gets priority on droppable loot, and scammers who infiltrate that
community are identified and expelled, then you've got an argument.
On my server that just doesn't seem to exist outside of guilds and
guild alliances.
