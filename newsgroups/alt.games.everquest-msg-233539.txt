If you have a goal such as:
Level 65 and 28 aa (my goal from the time I started playing my kitty
seriously and only 'botting my mage - 6 general, ND3, Pet Hold and
Paragon) you are better off simply going 100% xp to 65 then 100%
aa to 28.  At 65 I now have my 65 warder, Spiritual Dominion, Arag's
Celerity(*) and Spirit of Rellic  Those 4 spells make me vastly 
superior to the 62 BL, and far more able to get groups in decent xp
grind zones.  That translates into more XP per hour over the course
of this period of leveling and therefore a shorter time to my goal.

Also, we discovered that I can easily tank HoH mobs without draining
our clerics mana (of course he's 185+ aa's with FT11).  On your typical
HoH mob I grab it from the puller with slow, then incapacitate
(for aggro as much as anything) then DoT (again for aggro).  The
cleric usually leads with Elixer (he gets a full 7 ticks out of it,
I tested it while maxing my defense.  There are 7 separate jumps in
the HP of my kitty.  That's with SCR3, SCRM and no EEIV item) then
1 of his quick heals near the end.  On really bad fights he might have
to hit me 3 times with the quick heal.  And I only have my 50% slow 
:-P 

Have I mentioned I love my kitty?  :)

*  WTF is up with SOE programmers and the ` (grave accent) being used
interchangeably with ' (apostrophe)?  It's REALLY distracting when
you try to look up Arag's Celerity and it doesn't come up on lucy
because it's Arag`s Celerity.  Worse, EQWatcher pronounces the 
grave accent separately.  So, instead of hearing "Flameshield of
Ro has worn off on Bosra's warder" I hear "Flameshield of Ro has 
worn off on Bosra grave accent ess warder."  Same with many spells.
