Did you replace an item in that slot that had some STA on it?  If you
replaced an item with +3 STA, then you only netted a +12 STA, which would be
72 hp.

I have done this so many times, thinking I am gaining +15 and forgetting
that I am also LOSING +5 so I am only netting +10 of some stat.

Also, 199-174 is 25, not 15.

I don't know the ratios or formulas, but this was one possibility that I
have done myself.
