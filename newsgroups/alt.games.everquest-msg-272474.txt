    So people don't have to visit out-of-game sites to figure out how to get 
from point A to point B. The EQ world is pretty big, and a newer player 
won't always know where Crypt of Dalnir and Crypt of Nadox are.

    As an example: you're a tradeskiller. You want spider silks, and are 
willing to pay X for them. With the barter system as I'm seeing it, you can 
leave your trader up, with the offer to buy any spider silks handed to you 
for X each. People will be able to search The Bazaar and see if anyone 
wishes to purchase a given item from them. I'm a big Bazaar buyer/seller, 
and I'm really pumped about this feature. I'd love to have standard "Will 
Buy" amounts for certain rarish items, so I could get them before someone 
else.

    I'd love to free up a base inventory slot which is now devoted to food 
for force-feeding, and cloudy potions in case invis dropped early. I'd get 
another nine slots of carrying capacity out of this, and as a tradeskiller I 
still use every slot I can get.

    Rogues used to swap weapons to bring in a high DAM piercer for 
backstabs, then swap it back out for regular DPS. Today, I see this mostly 
being a bard thing, with all the instrument swapping they have to do. And 
for utility items - I'd be happy with a way to quickly swap my epic 1.0 into 
my hand for ressing, and my GVD into my offhand for invis, and....

    There's plenty of people out there who feel like you do. Maybe the group 
of you should get together and form a guild! ;-)
