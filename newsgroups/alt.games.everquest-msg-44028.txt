I need some help folks !

I got my Druid to 20th and eveybody said go to LOIO, so I did.
Well, on my server, LOIO is a zone populated by loners, or groups
of loners. I have yelled and died with people standing not 5 feet away;
my guess is waiting to kill what I'd been fighting. The hunting is ok, but
I'm in this game for the interaction as well. I play at odd hours, so none
of my RL EQ friends are on. I've started new characters in the hopes of
recapturing the fun of the newbie levels. Anybody got any suggestions
where my druid can go to hunt, level, and converse ?
