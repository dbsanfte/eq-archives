Hmmm, I look at the same facts and reach the opposite conclusion.
Without a god, free will is a given since there's ample proof that
even the deepest rooted instincts can and are often ignored by people.
From my perspective, it's only if you add God to the equation that
lack of free will even becomes a possibility.
