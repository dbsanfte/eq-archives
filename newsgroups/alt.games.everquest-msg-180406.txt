You had bad luck.  This happened to me a few weeks ago.  I must have killed
a dozen of them and only made about 8pp, then it changed and they started
dropping more plat.  Even starting out slow, I still averaged about 120pp
per hour after selling all the FS weps that drop.

Not so sure about rogues being the problem.  First of all, you would notice
if a rogue was close enough to your Giant to PP it.  Rogues can't PP while
hiding.  Also, PPing creates BIG aggro so you would notice a rogue getting
stomped on from time, or you would see your Giant aggro and start chasing
the rogue.  Rogues also get random loot off the Giants, and they always get
ALL of something, so if the giant dropped 4pp, then that means that it
couldn't have been PP'd because if it had, there would have been no plat at
all.  Also, you would notice that sometimes it had NO gold, or silver or
copper.
