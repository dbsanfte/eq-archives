To answer your question, I am on my fourth cleric, having played two of them
to 40+...now a gnome cleric and finding I enjoy role playing vs power gaming
a LOT more...and having done lots of revives and rezzes, I have NEVER seen
such a message.  If you have velious, I might recommend east wastes and
ulthorks...easy quadding and safer
