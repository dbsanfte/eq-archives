I just dinged 14 in Misty Thicket. Bought my spells (most) with like 4-5 pp
remaining. Now have some good spells, SOW, Stinging Swarm). I need some cash
and looking for snareworthy evens and yellows. Where should I be going?
Oasis?

Also, I have accumulated some Misty Acorns, a stack of silk swatches, and a
bunch of pelts from a trip I made to the commons. Are these worth much at
the Bazaar?

Any other advice welcomed - like a low cost, common magic item that is
easily obtained?


TIA
