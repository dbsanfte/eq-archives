I would have to say I feel the same way. Hailing an NPC and seeing 10 lines 
of text fill my chat window always bugged me. I know I'm not the only one 
guilty of often merely locating the bracketted words, ignoring what may 
actually be somewhat interesting dialog or backstory.

Personally, I'm looking forward to the voice acting. What I've seen has 
been pretty decent. I just hope I don't wind up having to hear the same 
dialog over and over again.
