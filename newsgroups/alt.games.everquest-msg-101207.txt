If there is truly an increase in the incidence of leukemia near that
plant -- and I don't doubt this, just not familiar with the specifics of
that case -- and if that higher incidence can be linked to the plant, then
there is indeed a problem in the way it's being run.  But why would the
media single out sellafield if it was a problem common to all nuclear
plants?  It's my conviction that the media is going after sellafield because
the issues are specific to a badly run reactor, not to reactors in general.

Leukemia has a number of causes.  One of them is exposure to radiation.
Another is cigarette smoking.  Another is exposure to benzene, present in
gasoline and other chemicals.  There are many possible reasons for the
problems around sellafield, although I don't pretend that the reactor isn't
the prime suspect.  Has the media done independent tests to measure
radiation levels in that vicinity?  Or is it too easy to say, "Well there's
a reactor there.  It must be the reason."  Funny too, speaking of the causes
of Leukemia, that I have never seen the cry go out to force refineries to
get benzene out of our gasoline.  I was once told that it can be done, but
that the cost of the process would make gasoline about ten times as
expensive as it currently is.

I know it must sound like I am rambling here, but the thrust of that last
paragraph is to ask this question.  Why is it acceptable or at least
tolerated by the public at large when people die of Leukemia as long as they
get it from exposure to fossil fuels, but big news if it is suspected to be
a result of exposure to radiation?

I wish it weren't so, but plain old boring truth doesn't raise eyebrows.
The truth is, nuclear energy has (or can have when done properly) less of an
impact on the environment than many other sources of power.  Surely, the
industry knows this sort of statement cannot compete with claims that
nuclear power kills people.  So they try to grab the eyes with those "fluff"
commercials you mention.

Who commissioned the studies that generated these reports?  If it was a
party with clear interests on either side of the debate (as seems to me to
be the case with many such reports) then they must be discounted.

Here's the thing.  We have more people in the world than ever before.  Hence
more demand for power.  Certain organizations oppose underseas oil
exploration, exploration for oil in nature preserves, the building of dams,
the burning of coal, and nuclear power.  All of these methods of power
production have their down sides.  But if we don't bite the bullet and go
with one of them, where will our power come from?
