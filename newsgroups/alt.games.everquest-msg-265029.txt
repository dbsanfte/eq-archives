This is an interesting question;

My first thought is yes, EQ2 has virtually taken over the discussion 
here and I hardly see any mention at all of EQ

But on reflection, I think the same thing is going to happen to EQ 
itself; the same way Civ II took over from Civ I.

They told us the two games were going to both be maintained, both 
continue to get upgraded... and perhaps that will be true to some extent.

But the marketing and general consensus from people in the Beta seems to 
indicate that EQ2 is likely going to supplant EQ.

If that's the case, then keeping this the EQ newsgroup, both for the EQ1 
hangers on and the new EQ2 population, seems to make sense.

And if, after the first couple months of EQ2, the posting goes back to 
being primarily about EQ1, then that too will seem to make sense; it 
will indicate that EQ2 was a failure after all, at least insofar as 
pulling the AGE people away and causing them to talk about nothing 
but... our population here isn't really all that good a reflection of 
the typical MMOG player.
