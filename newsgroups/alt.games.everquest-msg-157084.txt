Heh, another supporting anecdote for Cel's "Monk nerf was really a
leather-class nerf and nailed the Druids too" hypothesis?  I do
know that with 700+ AC on a plate wearer I would not expect to take
near max damage on every hit from a 25ish mob.  And my Druid had to
be more disciplined than usual when I played him for a bit after
release, seemed like even more of the hits were big than usual (was
killing Aviaks, Tesch Mas Gnolls, and the occasional Elephant in SK),
but I didn't think too much of it as his AC is only a hair over 500.
It'll be too bad tho, if my "big tough" human Druid has to give up
melee so young (L25), I mean it's not like I'm some frail wisp of an
Elf or one of those candy-assed Halflings.
