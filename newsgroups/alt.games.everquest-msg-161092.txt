I wanted to say something about the nice people I found in the AGE
channel. No foul mouth JR high jokes, no cursing and complaining, just
nice chit chat about EQ.

It was nothing like the NG :-)

Annie made a point about possibly being unguilded, but after last
night, I am in no hurry to re-guild up. With the chat channels, the
raid chat system, and the bazaar, then only thing I need is the tag
over my name.

I better put on some FR gear. 

This isn't a antiguild rant, just a rose for the guys on AGE. If you
love the guild system, then good for you. I am sure I will love it too
when I get to endgame. I change servers, and keep crossing those
lines, and having AGE as a community ACROSS servers is nice.
