I'm in the same boat, but I'm not sure of your conclusion.
I agree that I don't intend to try EQ2 for a while (I just
don't have the time for both, and I'm still having fun in
EQLive), so I'm mostly not interested in EQ2.  (I've read
a few posts to get some idea what it's like, but I don't
need to read more at this point.)

But I don't want all the EQ2 players to go off and talk by
themselves, if only because lots of them used to play EQLive
and might be willing to share their experience and wisdom if
they see me post a question.  I don't think it's fair to
expect them to keep reading a.g.e just so they can see my
questions, so I'd have to post in a.g.e2 to get their
attention, which means I'd be sticking eq1 stuff into their
eq2 newsgroup, just because I wasn't willing to put up with
their eq2 stuff in my eq1 newsgroup?

I don't know; I think we mostly need to wait and see how much
discussion there is after things have had a chance to settle
down a bit.  I don't know the procedure, but I don't think it
takes *that* long to create a new alt.* group if we decide
it's necessary.

I do warn y'all that, if EQ2 does continue to be discussed in
the a.g.e newsgroup, I will *not* be attempting to maintain
details about EQ2 in the FAQ.  But I have, for now, added a
question to the FAQ regarding whether it's okay to discuss
EQ2 here.  And I'll make the answer be whatever we decide,
but what I'm proposing as a straw man is:

Q: Can I post about EQ II on alt.games.everquest?

A: For the time being, yes.  At the moment many of the EQ II posts are
comparisons between the two games, so the relevance to "traditional" EQ is
clear.  Once EQ II has been released and had a few weeks or months to settle
down, the a.g.e readership may decide that too much of the EQ II discussion
is no longer interesting, at which point a separate newsgroup may be formed.
