Polished Steel Ulaks drop of Tribal Lookout in Dawnshroud Peaks - be a while
before you could get them yourself so it would be worth buying (but don't
spend over 100pp each). The stats are:

9 Dam, 27 Del, 3 Str, 3 Wis, 3 SvM, 25 HP, 25 Mana

The only trap is that these are so much better than other weapons commonly
availiable to non-twinks that you can come to rely on them and ignore
piercing. I ended up just equipping a Recondite Bandit Dirk (You will get
one of these eventually once you start on the bandits in Paludal) in the off
hand on easier blue mobs, ie Mushies and later on Grey Hoppers.

If your mildly twinked or have nice friends, a Harpoon of the Depths or
similar would be even nicer.
