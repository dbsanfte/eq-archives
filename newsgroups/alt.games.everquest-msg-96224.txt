Calm down Jazz, the removal of hell levels does not necessarily mean
that it will be easier to get to 60. I would guess that they will just
spread the load across all the levels. At the moment it is easier (in
terms of xp) to do level 29 than it is to do level 20. If the made the
progression linier then the total to get to level 53 could be the same,
just with the road bumps at 30 35 40 and 45 removed.
Make it one big hill rather that "flat" sections divided by blooming
mountains.

Jim
