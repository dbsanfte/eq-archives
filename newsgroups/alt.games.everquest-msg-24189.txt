Thank you! I have checked out eqatlas on several occasions, and some
of the others as well. My biggest problem with this is being
overwhelmed with the sheer volume of information.

There seem to be extensive lists on what the best items for [a given
class] are. I confess I have yet to spend the hours necessary to
figure out what exactly I need to get (read about item, check quests,
check locations, check monsters to see if I can do the quest, check
prices, repeat with next item, etc.)

Verant doesn't appear to have skimped on content, that's for sure.
