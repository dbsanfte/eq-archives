You are so dead wrong on this it is sad.

Hardly! And I quite resent your assumptions about what I want from an 
MMRPG 'WORLD'.

I find the global channels to be a negative actually. I don't even care 
for ooc/ and zone wide shouts. I don't care for guildchat either or even 
tells, but I recognize the latter 2 are an absolute necessity; it would 
be impossible to play the game without them. I'd prefer just say, and 
gsay, if it were feasible, but its not.

I do want a multiplayer game, a massively multiplayer game even. I want 
to walk into a crowded freeport and do some buying and selling with 
other players. I want to meet other people hunting and travelling as I 
run from Freeport to Qeynos; I want to get picked up by a bard as he 
runs by to speed me on my way. (all obsolete now that we have the 
unattended pc bazaar and pok books).

What I do not want is to zone into lower guk to heroically defeat the 
ghouls and be told there is an an available uncamped skeleton in the 
bedroom closet and Mezzchanting Ubercrack the enchanter in the supply 
room is planning on logging out in 45 minutes or so, and I'm welcome to 
join that group when he leaves.

What I do not want is to zone into the plane of fear to slay the 
resident god and find the zone empty, with a note on the wall saying 
Pharmlords Guild was here, don't bother staying we'll be back to farm it 
again in 20 minutes.

What I do not want is to zone into the warrens at 16th, and start 
fighting my way to the King room and have some 60th level ranger zone in 
on his way to stonebrunt, run past me, and kill the King on his way 
through for kicks, or to be fighting up ToFS get to the 4th floor and 
suddenly have a group camp-in on the 5th floor and start farming it.

Instanced dungeons solve these sorts of problems.

Lots of people playing in the same area *but not necessarily together* 
only works if they aren't competing for the same kills. In EQ however 
this doesn't work...typically only a few kills in each zone are worth 
making, if the zone is popular you rapidly have people conflicting on 
them, which is a decidely un-fantasy game result... when was the last 
time a p&p gm sent you to a dungeon that was full of heroes and devoid 
of monsters... or to slay a monster who was nailed to the wall by 
another group when you arrived? Or read a book where this happened? Or 
watched a movie where this happened?

Instanced dungeons done right can resolve this. Instanced dungeons LDoN 
style are on par with Diablo 2 'HillRunz' and are a bad joke.

I don't even think instanced dungeons need to be restricted to a single 
group... perhaps an AI component that spawns a new instance when the 
first is too full (based on average mob survival time or, % of mobs 
getting killed per hour, or something). And some sort of mechanism to 
let groups bring their friends into the instance they are in...
