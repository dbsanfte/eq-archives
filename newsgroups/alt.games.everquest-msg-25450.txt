Thanks alot to everybody who replied :)
I've learned alot about grouping now and what makes a good/bad group. I realise
i also made mistakes in that particular instance and have an /assist macro and
a /gsay Im being mashed, please help ;)
My original post was a bit whinny when what i really wanted was good advice
