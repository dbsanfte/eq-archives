I have two hard drives in my system, so I just copy it to the spare if I
need to reformat.  Haven't had to do that yet since going to Win2k.  I have
always kept the old hard drive from my previous system, and installed it in
my new system, keeping the newest one each time of course.  So I always have
that option available.  I do have a CD burner too, but this is a lot faster.
