My bard did this at 52 with a 52 monk buddy, and again just a little
while ago at 55 solo for my 30 warrior (well, really I was getting him a
bow but it seemed like fun to get the key since I was already there).
Two mobs that are always up, pretty easy kills, elapsed time per key
roughly 20 minutes including getting -to- the and the running to the
emporer with the parts.  I bet a full group of 46's could get that key
with a little effort.  This is radically different from trials!
