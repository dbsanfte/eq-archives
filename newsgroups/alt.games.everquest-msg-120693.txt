I am a little confused about this subject.  There was a website that was all
about the firepots.  I looked at it a couple of times but it seemed that
they were not working and it was a big mystery as to when and if they would
ever be up and running.  Now I see a post that the firepot end gates have
changed and people seem to be using them.  So where can I get some
information about them?  I looked everywhere for the site I visited before
but could not find it. I think it was called The Underground Highway or
something like that.  Does anyone know the correct web address of this site,
or of another site that would give the locations of the pots and other
information about them?
