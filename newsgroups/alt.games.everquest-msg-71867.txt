I'm a human paladin.  I started playing the game and having fun, checking things out.  Then after I got up a couple of levels I
actually pulled out the instructions and started reading.

I wanted to join the Paladin guild, but it said that as a new player I should hand a note given to me when I first start out to my
guild master.

I don't remember ever having that note.  The only thing I can think that may have happened is that I got killed once at a low level.
I had nothing of value (I thought) and I never went back to my body.  It may be then that I lost my papers.

(This is something that just dawned on me.)

I thought that maybe being a Paladin, I needed to complete the quests given to me to prove my worth.  I got Squire Nals's head.  I
got the Venom Sack from a desert tarantula.  I handed the token of generosity to (I forgot his name, he's standing by the river
there behind the hall of truth) and then a couple of levels later, I handed him the token of bravery that I got for killing the
tarantula.

AND - Nothing.  I got some experience but I'm still not in the guild.  If I did lose this note, am I screwed?   Do I have to start
over if I want in the guild?
