I was a child when the original series aired on Saturday mornings. I
have to say that I found the Sleestaks and their dark city extremely
frightening. Of course, those were much simpler days and kids today
probably wouldn't even flinch at that. The remake series was really bad.

Everybody sing:

It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
