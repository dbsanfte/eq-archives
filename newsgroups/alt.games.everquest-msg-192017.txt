"well grounded in logic --or-- truth --or-- having legal force" (emphasis
mine)

Thus one choice is "well grounded in logic", ignore the other two for the
moment.

Logic is funny, its sort of a "garbage in, garbage out" thing.  You need
some givens to work from, using those, you can prove or disprove a given
axiom (or in some cases, merely prove that you don't have sufficient
givens, or that the givens are in fact contradictory and can't all be
true.)

So its entirely possible to logically prove things that are not true...
and we won't even have to blink at logically proving things which aren't
legal, as there's precious little logic  in much legal procedings.

If you are a monkey, and all monkeys like bananas, then Darktyger likes
bananas.  Do you like bananas? Lets say no for the sake of the arguement.
If I dont' have that given, though, and -do- have the other two premises
as givens, then I can logically conclude that you -do- like bananas.
Assuming either of the two premises is false, the conclusion is actually
wrong... but quite logical.
