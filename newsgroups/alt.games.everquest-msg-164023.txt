Yeah, unfortunately there is alot of racism in the USA.  For example, my 
mom has some good friends she talks about alot.  She talks about all the 
silly things they do because they are christians.  I was under the 
impression these people were the epitome of 'holy-roller', in other 
words, the kind of person who looks for all good things in every thing 
they do.  Until the day I met them and had to spend 2 hours stuck in 
same room with them.  These people are the worst example of racist 
bastards I've ever seen.  The only reason I didn't get up and yell how 
stupid they were, was because I was at my mom's house, 3 hours away from 
my house and I didn't have my own car.  Instead, I just left the room. 
I refuse to speak to them or about them since that day.  Has bugged me a 
little that I didn't tell them why I had to leave the room so abruptly. 
  (I was at a point where I wanted to smash her hypocritical mousey 
little face into the dining room table.)
