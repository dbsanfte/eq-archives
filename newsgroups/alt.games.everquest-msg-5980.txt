Full answer:

Every second the game checks status on certain things.  Regeneration is on a
6 second timer (as are many other things in the game).  There are no real
"tic's" in EQ as it is constantly checking states (example:  Drowning you
get to drown every second, if it were "tic" based you would only drown every
6 seconds)

All that having been said, regeneration (AKA: natural healing) in the game
is on a 6 second timer and leads to folks thinking that EQ, like MUDS, is
tic based (it's not).  In 6 seconds each player heals a set amount of hp.
That is:

Everyone except Trolls and Iksar:  1hp standing/2hp sitting (till level 20)
Everyone except Trolls and Iksar:  2hp standing/4hp sitting (till level 50)
Everyone except Trolls and Iksar:  3hp standing/6hp sitting (I don't know if
it goes up at 51 for non-regeneration races or not beyond this, I've never
really paid attention to it on my non-troll characters)

Trolls/Iksar: 2hp standing/4hp sitting (till level 20)
Trolls/Iksar: 3hp standing/6hp sitting (till level 50)
Trolls/Iksar: 4hp standing/8hp sitting (till level 51)
Trolls/Iksar: 6hp standing/12hp sitting (this increases throughout the 50's,
I don't have numbers past 51)

Hope this helps!!!
