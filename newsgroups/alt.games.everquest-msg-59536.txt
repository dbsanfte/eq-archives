  I was wondering if anyone plays EQ using Linux? I recently bought SuSE
Linux 7.2 and am trying to get up the nerve to actually install it. Aside
from some possible hardware issues I might have (the Modem being the
biggest), if I can't play EQ...
  I have been looking at WINE but frankly I'm rather new to Linux in actuall
practice. I know it's not going to solve all my problems but from what I
understand it's a good alternative to Windows.
  So if you run EQ on Linux let me know what hoops I gotta jump through to
get it to work.

Thanks,
