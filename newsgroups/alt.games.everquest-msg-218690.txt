  Fair enough, I guess.  But if you don't want people to be rude to you,
you might lead by example.

   Yes, I am sure you are capable of being quite nasty.  Thanks for the
invitation, but raw flaming isn't really my style.

   Being snippy is being snippy.  Believe it or not, we don't have
direct line into you head that lets us know when you feel it is "no big
deal" or not.

   Again, fair enough.  I know that I've certainly misspoken here
before.  Alot of people have.  And not all have had the character to
admit it afterwards.

There are *a lot* of parents out there with genetic issues who
choose to have children anyway.  They play Russian Roulette with
their children ("he only has a 75% chance of getting XYZ...").

Those kind of people should be shot.

   Like you, I will be perfectly willing to admit that I misspoke. 
Please explain in a reasonable manner how "You implied that people who
have less than perfect genes that decide to become parents anyways
should be shot." is not a fair summation of this post.  I guess you can
take issue with my use of the word "perfect" in this usage, since you
were you using the figure 75% rather than, I dunno, 0.00001%.  Would it
have been more accurate if I has used the word "adequate"?

    That's a lot less aggressive statement than the post I quoted.  It
can still be debated, of course, but it isn't nearly as extreme or
offensive.

   I appreciate that you want us all to be exceeding polite, and really,
that's not a bad thing at all to hope for.  However, I can and will post
any way I feel is appropriate.  I do believe that being polite is a good
thing, of course, so hopefully the world will be in harmony, at least on
this issue.

   Thanks for the benefit.  But, you say that these things are "clearly"
not severe genetic disorders.  There are plenty of people who think that
they are.  Things that you believe are patently true are not necessarily
universal truths that are obvious to the rest of the world's
population.  

   Also, just because I would also like to be clear as possible, I'd
like to say that I in general respond to posts on an individual manner. 
I do not research every recent post someone might have made on the
subject at hand.  True, it might be better if I, if we all, did that. 
But I just don't see that happening.  It might be best if you just
considered this to be one of the charms of usenet.

   I appreciate your trying to make me feel better, but I've pretty much
come to terms with the hand I was dealt.  At least I got the "knows how
to cook good" and the "is better than play chess than Lenny is" genes,
so I feel it wasn't a total washout.

> I'll try to end this on a positive note.

  An uplifting gesture.  I'll try to do so as well.  Since you seem fond
of typing out my full name, I'll tell you that my middle name is
"Marie".  So if you really like typing out the whole thing, you can
indulge that whim to its fullest with "Ms. Annie Marie
Benson-Lennaman".  However, it might be easier to just stick to "Annie"
or "Tea", as most others on usenet or the AGE channel do.
