Oh, not in the least! And please note that I never said anybody else was
"wrong". Simply that in the groups I play with, that's how the term was
used in my experience. (I think I even went so far as to say to you that
it might be server specific.) I simply disagree with the other
interpretation.

My only beef with it is people who take *their* interpretation, (read:
opinion) and then state it as a "well known fact which you were
obviously ignorant of" etc.

Big difference. If there are people in the game using Int Caster and Wis
Caster, lumping them together to cover all the "pure casters", (as
opposed to the hybrids and melee) and if a VI representative  wants to
"establish some definitions" supporting it, then the other
interpretation isn't as universal and "clearly defined" as some would
like to maintain.
