I assuming the Gateway has some kind of on motherboard sound chipset? You
haven't mentioned what sound card you actually have, nor the motherboard in
question in case it is onboard sound,  so it would be a very gifted psychic
indeed who can help you out with this one.

I am also assuming being a P4 it was shipped with WinXP or  maybe Millenium?
Hang on a tic, I was forgetting my talent....

*hands to brows*

Hmmmn....

*Veins bulge in forehead*

Got it! You sacrificed your black chicken within a <broken> chalk circle and
had aligned the Gateway box to Magnetic North instead of True North before
unpacking it!!

Tsk Tsk...

You were doomed from the beginning!
