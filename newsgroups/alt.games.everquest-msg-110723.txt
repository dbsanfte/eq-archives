You have really lost me here.
You complain that saying that right and wrong are subjective is
"Assertation, not fact." and then you blithely spout out that Al Qaeda
are "wrong" and that this is a matter of "fact".

What you have basically said here is that anyone who does not hold your
view of the world is wrong, and that you hold the rites to decide what
is right and wrong and thus what is good and evil. 

Either you are just the sort of person who should never be trusted with
any power or you are a troll and should never be trusted with any power.

How does it feel to be that self-righteous ?

Jim
