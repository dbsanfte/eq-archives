Indeed. I've gotta think that there's a *lot* of internal discussion and
support for the idea that has to occur before a poll gets put up on
everyone's login screen. The fact that this idea got this far means that
there are strong lobbyists internally for the concept. If it comes down to a
debate between those who want to monetize an activity that is already
occurring and for which Sony arguably is leaving money on the table, vs.
someone's concept of the "integrity" of the game, who could have any
question about which way that decision will go?
