A whole lot of big bad nasties on that side,  Very Very aggresive, most blue
to my 30 ranger.  I've heard that 50s can get xp on that side but i'm not
high enough to check that out.  There's also a tunnel that allegedly
contains the entrance to an unopened zone and some really high nasties
guarding it, I haven't been up the tunnel to look at it cuz I'm a fearful
little woodelf.
