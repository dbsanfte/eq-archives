Well, as soon as you can memory blur is a good idea, as you can wipe the 
hate list (No, you *don't* want to hit our cleric! You forgot allll aboutn 
that GHeal...) and save her butt in a pinch. Also, I would advise getting 
all the buffs possible so you can either buff your pet to the gills or you 
can make a tank out of anyone that happens to be around. A ranger with a 
cleric and a chanter backing him can actually make a decent tank.
