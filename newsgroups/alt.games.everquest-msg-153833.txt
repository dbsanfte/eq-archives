I have only risen to level 42 (dwarf cleric), but the more I hear about the
50+ game the less interesting it sounds. I have several friends who have
made it deep into the 50s, and it seems like I'm getting a far more varied
and interesting gaming experience than they are now. I read a description of
the cleric epic with time estimates for the camps -- yougottabekiddingme.
Hey I like this game a lot, but I plan to keep having a _life_!

I had already concluded that when I hit 50 I'll decide what my next MMG
choice will be. Since I've enjoyed EQ a lot, that choice could be starting
fresh in EQ with a completely different class. But I might instead go try
DAOC for awhile, or wait for EQ2...regardless, I am very unlikely to be
interested in the 51-60 experience that I've seen and heard about both from
RL friends and in the game. It sounds as if Verant is getting that feedback
from a fair number of people, and hence feels the need to realign the
endgame in order to keep customers.
