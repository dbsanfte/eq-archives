I know there are "partial resists" and I was at the San Diego Fan Fair and
got some information on the spell developers on this topic.  Specifically,
they were talking about the new bane spells and their aggro, but they also
covered resists.  To paraphrase the EQ Developers that actually make the
spells we use:

"With most DD and DoT spells there is a calculation that involves your
level, the MOBs level, their resistance, random factor and so on.  This
gives you partial resists with reduced damage, full resists, and full
damage.  However the Bane spells always do full damage.  There is no resist.
100% of the time you will do your 1000 points, which yes, is a lot of aggro.
That is why we gave these spells 200 range.  You can use your range as aggro
control."

Someone asked, "So range reduces aggro?"

The answer was, "Yes, range is one of the factors in the aggro equation."

"How much of a factor?"

"You will have to play with the spells and find out.  If you are too close,
your Wizard will do 1000 points of damage and be summoned right into the AE
range.  We all know how long you will last at that point.  But with a little
care and tactics the new bane spells should let Wizards stay viable.  We
realized the no-resists would cause trouble, and we already addressed it,
and now it is up to the players to decide just how they will use it, where,
and how often."

Someone else asked about how long you should wait to cast the bane spells,
which was ignored and they moved on to another topic.
