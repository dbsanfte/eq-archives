Hmmm. Probably 60% of the time. Will be a LOT less when I finally find the
UDB up.

Most of your skills are capped when you hit 40 until you hit 50 (when the
cap goes up). So, if you get some of those skills up, you can largely forget
about them until you hit 50. At 50, you make another brief rush to max them
out, and then you're done.
