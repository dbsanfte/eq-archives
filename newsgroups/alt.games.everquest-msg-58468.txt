Tailors should get the hint about that very early on. Most of my
characters have done *some* tailoring at early levels, though I never
mastered anything. But even for lowbie crap, there's always some
components that are a PITA (for lowbie standards, anyway) to get.
Example: my new necro needs to make small, large, and inky shadow silks.
There's only "x" number of shadow wolves (all green, btw) running around
the commons. You know how many of those fuckers you have to find/kill to
get *ONE* stinking shadow wolf pelt? Yes, yes, I know, it's nothing akin
to the aggrivation and danger of tailoring shit you need up in the two
hundreds, but it's still annoying as all fuck.
