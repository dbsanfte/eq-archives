If I were to answer "yes", then that would imply that I have and still do.
If I were to answer "no", then that would imply that I have in the past but
no longer do.
If I were to recreate the situation your reply was reffering to, I would not
be responding, however someone else would be responding in my place flaming
you, ignoring the previous post (the one which you were replying to), and go
on to assume it is you who has the problem for even asking such a question
because in their mind you would be assuming I were a wife beater.

Yes I know it is a question.  However, can you explain either the relevance
here or what you are trying to say?

P.S. Since I was very young, I watched the problems others experienced with
their relationships.  I made the observations that the problems involved
outweighed the rewards.  As I grew older, others around me only confirmed
this more often each day.  I have since continued my practice of "The best
way to avoid being envenomed is to not play with the (venomous) snake."
Even today, others prove to me, as well as instruct me (based on their
experiences), that my decisions in this matter have been wise ones.
    Therefore, the question of "Are you still beating your wife?" is
irrelevant, in my past, present, and future.
