I was kind of thinking of the times you have to run through a zone to get to
the zone you are going to hunt in.  Like Grimling for example.  I have
terrible lag in that zone.  I wouldn't mind checking it out a bit, but I can
barely manage a run through.

I personally never use Auto because it causes some problems for me.  If I
use it for a long run I disappear and no one can see me, or get messages
from me.  I have to camp and come back.  Very wierd stuff.
