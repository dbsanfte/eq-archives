Hehe, we ALL try to get killed by something we didnt expect. Just get used to
it.
Last one i got pissed over was being killed in Everfrost (talk about louse zone,
newbie zone, that have NO landmarks in half the zone, loc useless since half the
zone are mountains, and hear that a nice level 30 mob sometime run around in the
newbie area. Oh, lets not forget, 30 min to get there, even for a druid who can
port and sow herself). Used 30 min getting there, just got out of the
frustrating part of the zone, then a barbarian guard appearntly didnt like wolf
form, so killed me. Its a LOT worse when ther is a 30 min run through dangerous
zones, just because you are not accepted in wolf form there *s*)
Or the classic: Sand Giant spawning right behind the Inn in Oasis, you inside,
just at his aggro range, 2 sec later youre dead.
Or the "wow, forgot to look at the screen for 2 sec" and fall out over a cliff
taking 10000 dmg. Im still sure that The Hole zone was not a Erudin weapon, but
some troll not looking where he was going.
