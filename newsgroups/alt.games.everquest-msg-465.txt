The pace has slowed to the point the game is much less
enjoyable.  I am playing the forth character class I have
started that I have gotten to level 10 and each time I get
discouraged at this point.  I wonder if I am playing in the
wrong area of the game for my level.  So where do the people
here go at level 10?  My character is a Erudin Necromancer
and it does not have the advantage of getting all kinds of
good equipement from a higher level charcter so please take
that into account.  I mostly solo this character as well
since that is in keeping with a Necromancer being
universally hated in the realm.  Thanks in advance for all
replies.
