Unless you see a meleeing Cleric.... definitely shit for brains there!

My favorite thing about being a Cleric is just sitting back and healing
people, buffing them short term during fights, and helping them out after
the fight.  But yeah it can get really annoying when they expect them to
cure their disease or resurrect them without any thanks at all.  As if my
time is theirs.  If they bring the corpse to me, I will charge litte, if
they don't then they better have a lot saved in the bank because it is going
to cost them.
