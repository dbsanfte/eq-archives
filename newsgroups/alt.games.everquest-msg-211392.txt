Technically, I think their measurement units are based on the /loc units.
Also I seem to remember reading someone tested the max range of some spell,
and got the loc's, did the math, and came out with like 5.0 loc = 1 spell or
bow range unit.
I'm not sure about that, and have no way of testing. Myself, I just play it
by eye, I have a good eye for distances (I spent two years as a surveyor,
though half that I was the guy with the stick). I usually can tell if I'll
be in range or not on a given spell.
