When did Sony become a non-profit organization? Where does it say in
the EULA that "extra bullshit...that should have been in the game to
start with" will be given out for free?

The whole point of adding the expansions (and the new content players
will want) is to sell said expansions and keep people playing (paying
monthly subscriptions). New content has to be created, and that means
paying for artists, programmers, additional servers, and retail shelf
space. It's a win-win....Sony makes money, and players get new things
to play with..

You can still buy EQ basic and level 1-50 in the old world. You do not
"need" any of the expansions. If you "want" them bad enough, then you
can buy them just like everybody else. EQ is a game, not a charity and
not an entitlement.
