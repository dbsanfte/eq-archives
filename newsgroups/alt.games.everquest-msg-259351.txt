Heh, yep, that one gets used a *lot*. I'm quite familiar with that 
definition and the people who use it.

But ... I have to wonder if we're actually witnessing a difference between 
some cable and DSL systems. Leo's experience is pretty interesting comparing 
Comcast to Verizon. I'll get some data on Millennium Digital vs Verizon and 
see how that shakes out.

That way, when I die I can have even more reasons to blame "lag"!
