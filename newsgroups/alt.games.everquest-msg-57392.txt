Now that's amazing. I've been checking north Norwich exchange every
month for absolutely yonks now, and completed the BT notice of

been upgraded. Nada from them. Went to your link, and thence onwards
to BT themselves and it appears that north Norwich has just been
enabled. Thanks for the link. Things are looking up :).
