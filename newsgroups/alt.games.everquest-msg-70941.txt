Confused me for a moment with level one vicar, you mean your a 51st level
cleric?

Anyway, the PBB can be replaced for CBB (chipped) +5wis dropped off ogres in
WK (as well as other places I've heard but WK for definate)
Girdle can be replaced with a crystalline belt from Rygorr inspector in
Crystal Caverns (AC5 +3wis +3int)

They're easy ones off the top of my head (had to do a similar thing with my
druid)
