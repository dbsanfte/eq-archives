It is a very good moral axiom, and I do wish more folks actually followed 
it.  It has a slight weakness in that it assumes everyone wants to be 
treated the same, and we could probably get a good thousand post thread 
out of dealing with that. :)

Yup.

}Having known a good many prostitutes in my younger days (when I
}used to date a pro... not pay for one, mind you, but instead was
}the "boyfriend" a surprising number of working women have on the
}side) I can say that these stereotypes do apply in a few cases,
}but certainly not in most, not even in many.

Heh.  Aye, I'm another ex-"boyfriend". :)  I'd say it's probably 50-50ish.  
It probably varies a lot, depending on where in the world you are.  
California seems to have a large number of reasonably high-class types, 
but in the bad neighborhoods there's plenty of not as high class types as 
well.  I think society's first mistake is declaring prostitution to be 
bad.  It's very much a 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater' type 
situation.

The odd part to me, though, was finding out that a fair fraction of these 
women were actually strongly against prostitution being made legal, for a 
variety of reasons.  One being that it would probably negatively affect 
the price they would be able to charge, since there's always a premium on 
illegal activities.  But more importantly, if it were legal, it would 
become subject to all sorts of regulation, ie, they'd have to bring their 
apartments up to OSHA standards for a workplace, including installing 
gender-separated bathrooms, blah blah blah.  And thirdly, because if you 
look at places where it has been made legal and is regulated, like Nevada, 
the women tend not to be better off for it.

}Economics are
}responsible for a good deal more of the trade than anything else,
}that and society's placement of women on a lower pay scale than
}men.  Power for women, particularly in lower economic
}circumstances, often seems to be available most easily in the
}form of their gender.  Drug dependance and violence are generally
}the stuff of the media and pulpit, far more important are factors
}like insanely high college tuition costs, unbearably high levels
}of credit card debt, or the inability to work in a "mundane" job
}for wages high enough to pay for a babysitter.

}The "high class escort" is not driven by these things, so much as
}for real wealth, accumulating tens, hundreds of thousands of
}dollars over a span of a few years and then retiring, much as a
}professional athelete does, spending his valuable young physical
}potential to earn high dollars fast, then try to convert that
}into a second carreer which would probably be impossible without
}the punch of those big dollars.  

One of my favorites was a girl who actually had an MBA.  She'd set a goal 
of earning $87K by June, 2003, for precisely that purpose.  The only 
problem was, having achieved this goal, she was (a) -still- making very 
good money, and (b) enjoyed the work.  So she's still going. :)
