Not long at all... but put me in even the local wooded park in the 
middle of the night after madly chasing a wounded wolf and beating it 
down with a stick, in the fog/thunderstorm... and I wouldn't know which 
way was what... never mind pinpoint my exact position and make a 
bee-line for the gate.

Not that I think SH was implemented well before, or think in game maps 
are bad... but I think the fixes/additions were implemented poorly.
