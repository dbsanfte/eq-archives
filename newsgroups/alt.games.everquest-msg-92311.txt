Hmmm, maybe its your video card or gamma settings... Using a GF3 here with
latest drivers.

In Greater Wolf Form, which gives Ultra Vision, I still have no problem
seeing them. I got 2 in an hour last night, one of a Young and one of an
Elder, both Green to 52.

It  is hard to discern the bile glow from the reflection of the river or the
crystals, but just wait till they walk off. The easiest way for me to see
them is watching for the glow on the tunnel walls. I like to run in from the
south side - other side from Thurg - and look into the first tunnel to the
right. If you see a glow on the tunnel wall - you're good. Easy to pull out
to the plain as well. I've never even gone in as far as the Crystaline Wurm
Chamber - although I got a peek of Shardtooth last night :).

Oh yeah, the super secret thing was a supposed to be a joke - I shant forget
the ":)" again :).
