Unless they are selling many of them I let em undercut me... They'll sell
their one or two and I'll be back in business. I did buy 30 of something at
less than my sale price, just because I knew they'd move in a few days at my
higher price... profit is profit

I had 3 suits of Enchanted Teir'dal chain for 700pp each, someone undercut
me at about 400... I still sold all of mine within 3 days.
