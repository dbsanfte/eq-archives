I looked for the quatrain and could only find this one

The year 1999, seventh month,
      From the sky will come a great King of Terror:
             To bring back to life the great King of the Mongols,
                      Before and after Mars to reign by good luck

I guess its yet another translation, but hopefully it shows that these quatrains
aren't that clear. Thank God. I am not looking forward to WW III.

I also would like to express my deepest sympathies, and sincere condolences to
anyone and everyone that is/was struck by this horrendous tragedy. I can only hope
that the repercussions and aftermath of this unspeakable act lead to some good,
though it's a thin hope. And i pray for wisdom for our leaders.

Bart, Amsterdam
