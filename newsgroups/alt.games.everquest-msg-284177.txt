*IF* things are very much like the original then the only tank you
need is a monk.  Until Kunark monks were the shyte; could DPS far
better than rogues (rogues didn;t catch a break until Scars), could
avoid and mitigate better than any plate class, and could pull.  3
classes in one but most people didn't realize their uberness until it
was too late.  Kunark saw them get the ginormous nerf stick and
they've been recovering ever since.  Imo of course.  However, if
people thought it was indeed like the old days then roll up a monk and
take names.
Necro's and SK's have been seen as great and decent solo'ers
respectively.  The same logic could be applied to old world, it's just
that very few people figured it out fast.
You didn;t mention, or know, the numbers for each class.  Perhaps
people went batshit on those three classes and overpopulated.

In the old days they were far better than warriors.  Warriors had a
raw deal pretty much through to GoD.  Then they became the most sought
after class since most people at the high end gave up on warriors a
while back.
But again, people have learned over the years how things work.  Parsed
dps, figured out how to maximize a class and combinations of classes,
etc.  People figured out that for certain mob types you have to have a
warrior, with all it's extra HP and the mitigation/avoidance.  But
those didn;t come available until PoP, and didn't have a serious
impact until GoD.

Rogues back in the day were severly gimped.  If that's still the case
why play a rgoue?  Monks can out dps them and have FD.  Awesome combo.


Now of course all of my above statements are based on the actual
original coding.  If they have changed the coding to match today's
classes but just given people the old world economy and mobs and
zones, then none of it holds except possibly the numbers.  As in how
many of those closed classes do they already have?
