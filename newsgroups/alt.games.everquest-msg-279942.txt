I must have missed the patch notes that said they removed the level
limits on the zones, but boy is it fun :)  This weekend, we helped a
level 29 Inq do her JBoots.  We had a pretty decent train in both EL
and Zek, but nothing compared to the one in Feer =)  It was hilarious.
We had her escorted by three level 50s (assassin, dirge, templar).  The
assassin led the way, the dirge and templar were right behind the level
29 to provide dirge speed and reactives.  The dirge was casting buffs
constantly to pull the mobs away from her and get them on him.  That
was our second attempt at finishing that track - the first time we
weren't really set up, with a 36 conj, 44 conj, 50 dirge and the 29
inq.  The mobs beat her up rather early, which is why the conjs
switched to their mains (after completing the quest for themselves).

Overall, it was a blast.  I think tonight I am going to try to get my
level 37 conj up to the portal by SE.  That should make it slightly
easier to beg a group of 50s to take me into SE with them once I hit 38
;)
