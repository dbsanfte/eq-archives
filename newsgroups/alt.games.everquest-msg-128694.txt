Uh-huh.  How many CHeals do you see cast in Oasis?  LoIO?
FM?  Hint:  Clerics have to level up to 39.  And, except
against undead, they're extremely limited in doing so
outside of groups.  The healing bonus is there to make
up for THAT, not the later, non-issue of CHeal.

And, again, the bonus is there to *balance* the lower-end
differences between the priest classes, where the *only*
place a cleric has an advantage is in HP/AC buffs and
increased healing ability.  Druids or Shaman bring more
to groups *before CHeal* than a cleric does;  there has
to be some balance to allow clerics to level up.  And that
balance reflects the class:  clerics heal better.  At all
levels.  Period.  You can't remove that advantage without
re-balancing the priest classes at the lower-levels because
they are balanced at that point.

Besides, complaining about CHeal isn't relevant to a
discussion about the healing differential on the same
spells anyway.  Removing that differential won't mean
druids could replace CHeal with Nature's Touch.  All it
would do would make other priests more effective in
non-raid encounters.  And they already bring more to
those encounters than clerics do.  It's a non-issue
except for whiny druids who aren't content to already
be the second most powerful class in almost all areas.
