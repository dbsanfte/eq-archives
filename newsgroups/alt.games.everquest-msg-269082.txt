Um, thanks, but I could use a few more details, something closer to
the other class writeups?  And there's no need to SHOUT about what's
missing, since I admitted it up front where I wrote:

As for alphabetical order, I think the classes that ARE written up
are already in alphabetical order, but if they're not please point
out where they're not.
