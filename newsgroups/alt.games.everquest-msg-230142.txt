As for why the spell sells in the Bazaar for several thousand plat, the key
is that it has a base duration of 72 minutes. All melee classes dig that a
lot. Still, I sort of regret having shelled out 3k for it myself -- at 61, I
often find myself in groups getting other buffs that render IoS moot (either
because of stacking issues or because my stats are maxing out without IoS).
For a 60s BST, IoS is very valuable for soloing, but I rarely do that
anymore.
