The newbie armor can be fun, sort of, if you enjoy questing.  But it's

not too difficult to get much better in the bazaar.  At L14 willowisps
are pharmed easily, and still give xp.  Turn in the Greater Lightstones
to the gypsy in NK for more xp and a book that sells for 9pp+ (book is
a container, make sure you have top level slot(s) open).  At 14 a Druid
can easily gather 200 to 300 pp in a couple play sessions hunting wisps,
depending on competition.  With that much cash you can buy better stuff
than the newbie gear easily in bazaar.  At 14 AC is still very useful,
HP never hurt, but +WIS and +MANA are what Druids usually go after, and
several of the focus effects are very useful:  Affliction Efficiency,
Affliction Extension, Mana Preservation, Extended Enhancement, and
Affliction Haste and Spell Haste are all very useful, Improved Healing
is nice but the combination of relative rarity and great popularity
make Imp. Heal items usually way overpriced in terms of bang for the
buck compared to other focus effects.
