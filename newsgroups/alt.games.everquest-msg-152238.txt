Well theres a few more things they both get. Wizards get familiars for mana
regen. Druids get mana regen too (POTC) thats castable on others. Wizards
get gather mana spell too. Wizards can learn enchanced run speed at 51, so
they dont have to be slow. Druids can charm animals (proll useless) and dire
charm. Druids can get in groups easily now at 58+, which a wizard probably
wont, unless they need an evacer. Oh.. big one... Druids get track. Also
wizards get TL.
