    You have got to be shitting me. Here, let me fill you in on something.
When WE started killing Luclin bosses, WE were level 60, had crap-all for
AA's, and were wearing armour and carrying weapons you'd buy in The Bazaar.
Our casters had no foci and maybe, MAYBE, a few FT, and that was amazingly
uber if you had it. Are you trying to tell me that you have worse than that?
Right now my guild is raiding in zones that were freaking designed for level
70 characters - THAT is "taking out content far above you with shitty gear".
We've shown what we can do by killing stuff with gear that was appropriate
for the time, not gear, levels, and AA's released two years later that
trivialize content. Try taking out dragons sometime with no nukes over 1600
damage, no weapons better than 13/20, and no insta-cast raid-wide heals to
see how we had it back in the old days.

    33 hours in LDoN would net each person (1 hour per at Normal difficulty,
level 65 assumed) 1683 LDoN points. Assuming they qualified, that would net
each person a 100/100 item for 1492 points and leave some left over to work
towards aug'ing them. In addition you'd have the cash from item drops and
cash drops, which should be sufficient to buy at least one or two other nice
items in The Bazaar if pooled. You'll also have bumped your LDoN charms up
by 6+ HP/MANA (and possibly some other stats), and you'll have 11 AA's each
(about 1/3rd AA per hour Normal assumed).

    Those 50 people in the raid get diddly-squat in terms of cash drops. The
AA gain is laughable - the best raid XP I've ever seen would get us all
2/5th an AA in four hours, so collectively the raid would get 20 AA's to
your 66. We have four top-end drops, you have six solid items plus are
closer to making them even better.

    But, you see, you don't put in the time in LDoN to get geared up. I see
it when I look at the LDoN rankings on my server. You'd be in the top 100 if
you had 290 or more wins. That's 100 characters total that have adventured
close to enough to max the LDoN charm, let alone outfit themselves fully in
LDoN gear. LDoN came out in September of 2003. Ten months, average of 30
days per month = 300 days since release. If you'd done ONE LDoN per day
since release, 1 hour per day, you'd be in the top 100 and have four fully
aug'ed items or multiple items with lesser augs (like the ones that drop).
But I know the names of most of the people I see in the top 100. They're in
top guilds. They're not Joe Casual, who apparently can't spend one hour per
day to gear up.

    You didn't need to eat burning coals. You just needed to go on one
adventure per day.

    Yesterday's raid gear is sitting in NToV, in Sleeper's, in Grieg's End,
in Akheva, in Cazic Thule and it's not being killed. Yesterday's raid gear
is sitting in 18 man events in GoD, and PoP. Go get it.
