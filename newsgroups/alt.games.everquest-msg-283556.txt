 From the EQ site,

The Sleeper has been awakened!

The Sleeper has been awakened! We are going to open up a second 
progression server named The Sleeper on June 28th alongside The Combine. 
The rulesets of both servers will be identical. Also, we are opening up 
a second naming server for The Sleeper which will be available on 
Wednesday, June 21. Names will have to be reserved on each server 
separately. Long-term populations are hard to judge at this point so let 
me take a minute and explain our thought process on this second server 
and what might potentially happen.

Do we have the initial interest level to merit a second server?

The maximum number of simultaneous players for The Combine is set at 
more than double the usual number of players that are on simultaneously 
during peak hours on normal servers. That number of simultaneous players 
is much higher than any EverQuest server has managed at any time in our 
7-year lifespan. On a normal server only about one-third of players 
actual play at peak but we should also assume that this will be higher 
(at least initially) on the progression servers. What that means is that 
we have to believe that about 6 times our usual number of simultaneous 
players or more are interested in playing in order to justify a second 
server. This is a pretty big number. The only information we have to go 
on is the number of accounts that have created characters on the naming 
server and our own intuition. You have to remember that there is some 
number of players that will reserve a name but never actually log in. On 
the flip side this does not include any people that plan on coming back 
to EverQuest to play on the server but have not yet reactivated their 
accounts. Bottom line is that we think the interest is high enough to 
merit a second progression server.

Will we have the population necessary to sustain a second server?

Maybe. The amount of debate this server has caused is incredible and it 
also very clear that there are a lot of different viewpoints on how this 
idea should be implemented. Add in that whenever a new server is opened 
the interest in the first days is dramatically higher than the long-term 
population and you have a recipe for confusion. Our current theory is 
that the first days will require this second server but the population 
will probably settle down into a single server's worth of people. 
Although a cap on simultaneous population is technologically necessary, 
we need to do what we can to accommodate all the players that want an 
opportunity to try out the new server.

What happens if the population continues to be enough for two servers?

That would be great. I wonder which server will unlock Velious first.

If we do need to merge the two servers, how would that work?

If both servers are at the same stage of progression then The Sleeper 
will get merged into The Combine. If the servers are at different stages 
then the server that is behind will be merged into the one that is ahead 
in expansion unlocking. If there are naming collisions during a merge 
then the naming preference will go to characters on the host server.

If you have any questions please hop onto our forums and ask away!
