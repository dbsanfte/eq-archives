From the shadows, the mysterious "Archerbear"
<archerbear@notqwest.net> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

Fourteen at 65 actually.

What Andrew and the person he was talking to were describing was quad
kiting so the druid version is also snare blast blast blast followed
by eight minutes of medding. The only real difference is druids have a
much safer time gathering them up at the cost of taking somewhat
longer to kill them all and having to med more mana back.
