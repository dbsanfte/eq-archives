I can relate. When my first character (a wood elf ranger) was a baby of nine, I
decided it was time to take the boat to Freeport and see more of the world. Got
off the boat, got through the port authority building, and was taken down by a
guard. *blink* Ok, that was odd... Back to the boat, back to Freeport,
cautiously peek through the door of the port authority... and taken down by
another guard. Until this point, I had only spent time in Greater Fay and BB,
and had never gotten any negative faction hits with Freeport. I probably died a
total of eight or nine times as I inched my corpse closer to the dock. Once I
got my corpse looted (finally!) I found all the guards who had used me as a
practice dummy all day were suddenly apprehensive. I've never had a problem in
Freeport since.
