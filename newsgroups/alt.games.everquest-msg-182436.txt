Never played one, but I know people who swear by em, or the Troll
version.

I had fun up to about lv 12, then I started getting irritated with all
the money I was spending on gems to summon pets.

No controversy.  Iksar are by far the best Necros.  Only class they are
any good at infact.  I didn't really care for it though, only got mine
to lv 7 :)

Very, but paying for kei will get you into the good levels in a hurry,
this is the LAST class I'd recommend to a newbie.

Hmm.  I enjoyed playing a rogue at low levels.  It's fun sneaking around
and seing the sights.

Enchanters are fun after lv 12 when you get to start charming (badly),
until then they are an f'n pain.

My 43 cleric still isn't that fun.  Booring Job, then everyone dies. 
Actually I enjoyed him more in the early pre 30 days, cause I could get
kei and go to town on stuff.
