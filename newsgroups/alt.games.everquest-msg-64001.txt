I agree.  None of my characters have any of the teeth, but I have read up 
on them and was pretty excited about making the run to get the first one.  
I am pretty disappointed about not having to do it, now.  The keyring idea 
that has surfaced in the past was a great one, and should have been 
implemented.  -Someone- at VI must have thought of it or read it here at 
some point.
