Removal of the hybrid exp penalty, and the changes to group exp sharing that
went with it.   Groups became much more inclusive, allowing you to group
with who you wanted, without fear that adding a specific class or level
person would cause the entire group's exp gain to slow to a crawl.

Premature "greening" of mobs during 61 to 65.

I'm really getting tired of the same four fucking zones.   And I can't
really go back to the old haunts, even for a break, since they are now
mostly light blue / green, with the only blue sections being a half hour
fight in from the zone line.    (And being the parts that it would take a
"balanced" group to be able to go to)

Unnecessary as well.   I understand they wanted people to move on to the new
zones, but the insane exp modifiers on the planar zones would have done that
all on thier own, while still allowing for "breaks" to all the level 55 - 60
dungeons now sitting almost completely empty.   It would still have been old
world gain rates, so half or less of what a planar group will pull in  (plus
the parchments most casters need do not drop there).   But you could have
gone there with a non-optimal group, and still had a fun time every so
often.
