the newbie cleric (DE) quests are great, if you're looking for fashion
(fashion = best excuse to do a quest IMO), and the DE cleric symbol quests
were very very entertaining

what are the races of your chars? just asking so i don't over-post

the Testament of Vaneer quest can be fun if your timing is lucky (you don't
want to have to camp 7 hrs) . . .you get to play cards with a crooked
erudite !

and for the record, my personal favorite quest to date is the Tashania (lvl
44 enchanter) quest . .. travel around the world, use illusions . . . plus
SWIMMING !  best quest ever !
