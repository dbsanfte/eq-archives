   Could be.  I know that I will be, if/when the time ever comes that I
cancel my account.  I might have another game(s) that I like alot more.  I
might have tons of friends in them to run around with.  I might never want
to log back into EQ again.  But just knowing that I've taken the next
logical step, and fixed it so that I can't just come stroll back in
whenever the whim takes me, will make me sad.

But on the other hand, he could be sad that he ever got sucked into
playing, and feels sad for those of use who are still playing and wasting
our pathetic lives.  

Hard to say, really.
