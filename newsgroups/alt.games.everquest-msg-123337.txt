The guide in this story could probably use some fine tuning of their
technique, but you sound a bit dense yourself. We're currently camping
Rage for a cleric in one of our allied guilds. We have 12 people in the
zone at the moment, and have had since Monday. I damn well consider it
camped, because there's 18 more who are either bound right on that spot,
(the wizards and mages, for starters) or have camped out their mains
there and are playing alts while they wait and listen in on the raid
channel. (That's me. Camped there Monday afternoon and just playing my
wizard since then. Half our guilds post fifty melee is camped there at
this moment.)

Last night, Talendor popped. We had a full raid force there and started
the pull in less than five minutes.

He dropped five spells, too. Pretty sweet. ;-)

But back to your original question, it sounds like you guys want to use
FiF as justification to fuck over somebody else's guild who's been
putting in the time to camp Rage.

Guides have "forced a roll" on MANY other occasions for rare, contested,
higher end spawns. They pretty much HATE doing it, but it's often the
only way to force a settlement when guilds start acting like children
and can't come to an adult agreement between themselves.
