Depends on the item in question, wouldn't you think?

It's not so cut and dried.

Just because it's a copyright violation of something that belongs to
Sony Online Entertainment (or whoever holds these copyrights), that
doesn't mean that the artist in question completely forfeits all of
his or her rights to the work.  There can still be plenty of
independent artistic merit and creativity in a derivative work, and
copyright laws apply to that.

So no, Sony couldn't swipe someone's EQ stories and bundle them up in
a book, and swipe some pictures from someone's EQ art site to
illustrate the work and publish it as an "Everquest Potpourri" without
any acknowledgement to the creators of the works they used.
