Those players leave FV.  It's as absurd to judge the FV environment
by a few people in the newb zones as it is to judge the environment
on Test by the newb zones on patch day.  Keep in mind that there are
way too many children of all ages who get their kicks by annoying
other folks, and that's exactly the sort who decide it would be fun
to go behave like that on FV.


<snip tale of ambitious attempt at roleplay in EQ> 

It sounds like you and your in-game friends have some great ideas,
perhaps you'd be more successful if you tried something a little
less ambitious.  There are active roleplayers in EQ, I've run into
them occasionally even on regular servers and they're not at all
uncommon on FV (despite the impression you got from a few idiots).
When I play my Druid on FV I take a sort of RP-lite approach, I
don't care much for "role-speech", but I enjoy playing a "lone-wolf"
wanderer who bestows the Rainkeeper's blessings on most any random
traveler he meets (drive-by buffing is fun, and with a Druid I've
got a nice selection of buffs and tremendous mobility), which is
completely in-character, if a bit generic, given my class and patron.
