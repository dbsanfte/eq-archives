I'm missing the dogma reference... doesn't seem to fit either the
definition except in a loose un-significant sort of way nor the movie.
Spell it out for me please :)

Methinks the parser is broken. You can't find meaning without free
will because there isn't one without free will.

At best the automaton will reach its inevitable pre-ordained state of
thinking of itself as having found a meaning... but if the meaning it
thought it found happened to be the real meaning of the universe its
merely coincidence and insignificant. Because there is nothing
meaninful or significant about anything an automaton does.
