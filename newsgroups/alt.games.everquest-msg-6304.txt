Yeah yeah everyone says the same thing until they have a high level
and can twink their other characters. Get over it.

Everyone started with crap and worked up at least one character. It
ain't fun to die to a fire beetle 20 times when you did that already.

Gee I just got this uber monk weapon, hmm you know I always
wanted to try a monk, ah what the hell.

Hell half the fun of this game is playing different characters.
