These are your coordinates. First is n-s, second is e-w, third is up-down.
Check this map.... http://www.eqatlas.com/oasisofmarrmap.html
You will see these coordinates refer to about the middle of the north.

Got to do a /loc to find your loc.

You can also buy chipped bone rods in most cities, which have 3 charges of
locate corpse (If you forget to do a /loc). They sell for a few pp. I know
the vendor next to the bank in kelethin sells them.
