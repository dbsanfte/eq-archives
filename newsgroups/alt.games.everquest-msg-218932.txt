Hmmmm.  Paladin gets first stun, first heal, and first buff at his
first spell level.  And, of course, he's a tank from day 1.  By
his second spell level (15) he's got 2 stuns, a better heal, another
buff, basicly he's got his class in a nutshell.  So then, why is it
that your typical L50 Paladin is a clueless doofus?  I think you
give SOE too much credit, and the players too little, for the depths
of bad play to which EQ players routinely sink.

kaev <--- wonders if that made sense as he heads out for coffee
