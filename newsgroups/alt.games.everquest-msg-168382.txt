Rare?  They drop every time off the mobs that drop them.  Once you can kill one
of those mobs, you can kill it every time it pops.  Power up your guild a bit
and then you can take down more mobs that drop them.  At this point we are
killing Zland, Kland, Vindi and SoRZ (used to kill Yeli too but he didn't drop
the thing) for them, and only Vindi doesnt' reliably drop a key.

We worked hard for our first 6 keys.  Now, keys are just part of the regular
"FFA mob check" pattern.

Now lets discuss the rest of your post.  I'm a cleric.  Worse, I'm a 65 cleric.
Pre POP and post Hammer of Divinity/Yaulp, cleric was arguably a melee class for
a while.  At 65, though, there's little in the way of worthwhile exp that I can
get solo meleeing, and while my damage output was at least a contender with the
50 to 60 crowd I hung out with in my 50s, its a joke compared to that of the
post 60s I'm usually with now.  I'm NOT likely to get a primal weapon in ST.
(primal are all dictate for my guild)

Is there anything at all there for me?  DKP and a whole lot of hunting of the
sort I like least, same zone same mobs again and again.  At first it will be
fun, since its something I haven't done.  But I've been watching guild chat long
enough to know that its going to become tedious.

Further, pre POP you could at least chortle over the exp you were getting in
there.  Now, though, instead of great exp for 60, its decent exp for 65...
compared to other non POP zones.  Compared to POV, its apparantly as much a joke
as Ssra was compared to PoD at 62.

Oh, and no parchments drop in ST.  Put spectral parchments on the mobs and my
attitude will change in a hurry!
