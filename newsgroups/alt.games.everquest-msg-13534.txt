As my new High Elf Wizard works through the levels (7 at the moment), I've
begun tailoring raw silk armor.  So far, pants and a cloak have gone off
without a hitch (skill is currently at 16).

It seems like I start tailoring for every character I create, but abandon it
after the leather I make becomes obsolete and move on to smithing.  However,
with the wiz I've begun to explore tailoring as a long-term skill.  This has
led to a couple of questions .... <g>

1) I have seen on EQTraders that it's possible to add pigment to armor as
it's being forged, tailored .... I just can't seem to find any instructions
on how to accomplish this.  Assuming I've come across a few evergreen leaves
in GFay, how can that pigment be incorporated into my raw silk armor?

2) I see in your tailoring guide that to make a robe I'll need two silk
swatches and a robe pattern.  Per EQTraders, the only place that has a robe
pattern is Velious ... not a safe place for a lvl 7 Wizard to travel just
for a pattern.  I thought that maybe 'cloak' and 'robe' were interchangable
(like 'skin' and 'pelt'), and ended up making a very nice raw silk cloak
rather than a robe.  Any idea where a robe pattern can be found other than
Velious?  And does the same thing apply to sandals (vs. boots), etc.?

Thanks in advance for any tips/pointers thrown my way.  As always, it's
greatly appreciated! :-)
