To be honest, I am not exactly sure, he only played one character, ever,
he is a real life friend, but or schedules did not allow us to play
together much, but I'll tell you what I do know.

He started much later in the game than I did, but, to my knowledge he
was never twinked, aside from a few peices of patchwork I gave him early
on.

I know he soloed all over Butcherblock early on, no big deal there.

At around 30, I bumped into him at the zone to Lower Guk and he said
that he soloed the undead frogs in the first hallway and from what I
understand, he did this till 35.

Much later I heard he traveled around a bit with a ranger friend of
ours. But don't know much aside from that. He quit the gane around the
release of Kunark and does not talk about it much aside from the fact
that he was totally frusterated doing the cleric BP quest. Something
about other people killing the triggered mob.

Basically, he ran around seeking out undead, and killed them like an
armored wizard. I am not saying that is the way I like to play, just
saying that there are other ways to play a cleric.
