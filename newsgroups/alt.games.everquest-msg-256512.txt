In an LDoN group yesterday I ended up leader again because I'm one of 
the people working on GoD leadership abilities.  About midway thru the 
run, I finally got to 6 points, which is my cap for my level or 
something, I can't buy HOTT if I want to, as its 7 point cost.

But that's OK, I've already selected my next pick, the 6 point ability, 
Spell Awareness.  Click on that, say yes, confirm in the box that pops 
up, and there it is.

Every "Quido starts to cast a spell" message is followed, on the same 
line, with <cannibalize II> or whatever the spell is.

Whenever a spell goes off, or a proc goes off, the message for that is 
also followed by <velium shards>

There's no added line for the spell name, except in circumstances where 
the original message is long enough and your window small enough that 
adding the name of the spell to the end forces wraparound.

TO me this is a big transformation in the game, instead of a black box 
where spells are going off randomly all around me and I have to just 
guess people are doing something or other, I suddenly see everything 
that's happening.

I'm suddenly mildly annoyed by the cleric's repeated messages that he's 
casting Celestial Healing on so-and-so.  I know perfectly well what he's 
casting, and when he starts, why it says so right on my screen... 
although to be honest, it doesn't say on who.

I'm elated to see the "Xander begins to cast" <lull> messages, as that 
will make assisted pulling much smoother, with less spam, I can stop 
asking my lullers to tell me when they've cast.

But the defining moment, the reason I bought the ability in the first 
place, doesn't hit for a while; we pull in a healer mob, chew thru his 
first 60% or so as usual, then he begins to cast a superior heal and I 
let it slide, he lands it, but we're eating his HP bar faster than that, 
now he's down to 30%, and starts to cast <complete heal>.  Bang, I stun 
him, get interrupt, and shortly after that he's dead.

If I'd interrupted the Sheal, he'd have cast the Cheal next and got it 
off, I'm reasonably sure of that because I was the only one interrupting 
spells most of the time.

Obviously I don't have a lot of experience with this yet, but its my 
hope that knowing what spells are coming off the mob will let me pick 
and choose which ones to let go and which to stun; my stun is insta cast 
but has a 12 second refresh on it, so any mob who's serious about 
casting is going to be able to get half his stuff past me, I want to 
stop the big ones like slow and CHeal and let the little ones like small 
nukes or Malaise slide.
