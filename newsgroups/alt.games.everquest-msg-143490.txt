Good grief man!  Do you think you're playing at nursery school recess?
Or have you played too damned many of those mindless single-player
games where you regularly walk out of the dungeon and sell/buy at
fixed prices?

There is no doubt that the seller in your example is being greedy.
That does <not> make him dishonest.  And he isn't being 1/100th the
scumbag a KSing solo druid/wizard/necro is, or an uber-bullie guild
steamrolling some other guild's raid, or...
There're <far> worse "evils" in EQ than somebody trying to make a
little extra pp in a trade.
