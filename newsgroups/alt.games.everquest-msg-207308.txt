Fixed it!

Alright.  I had used the advanced options of the installer to get most
of the files, and I had a Jaggedpine.s3d file in the EQ directory.
But I didn't have *.s3d files for warrens or stonebrunt.  Hence the
original request.

Another go round with the normal installer/ autopatch thing didn't
work.

So I used the stand-alone executable in the EQ directory,
OptPatch.exe, which was for some older version (1.1.6 or something
similar), and *that* did the trick.  

Warrens here I come!
