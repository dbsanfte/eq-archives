I know there are serverwide channels that extend beyond the particular
server you are playing on, but does each server have it's own serverwide
channel?  This would be handy if you wanted to find out if a spot is camped
in a distant zone, or if there is a cleric in the zone you died in, or if
anyone is casting KEI in the Nexus.  You could ask if there is anyone in
that zone that could check for you without having to go to that zone to find
out.
