I've only played CoH, but I've read a lot about EQ2. It seems to me that 
the soloing prospects of both may be fairly similar. Where CoH really 
shines IMO is the fact that it is just plain fun - uncomplicated, easy to 
get into fun. It genuinely appeals to that comic book fan in a person. 
Unfortunately, one of its perks can also be a weakness. You may come to 
view the simple game mechanics as over-simplification by mid-levels. I 
find myself settling on the most efficient attack combinations and 
hammering them over and over now.

I'll just give you my take on CoH.

Pros:

1. The absolute best character designer in the business, by far, bar 
none. SWG has a pretty good one, but it still doesn't compare.

2. If you liked comic books, you'll love CoH at least initially.

3. It's extremely easy to get into. Nothing about the game is very 
complicated. It's just great simple fun.

4. Mudflation will never be a problem, as there is no economy, really.

5. One of the first MMORPG's I've played where they actually *do* add 
content regularly *at no charge*. The new zone, The Hollows, is very cool 
and interesting. It's one of my favorites now.

6. Vanquishing evil-doers with super powers is just flat-out fun. :)

Cons:

1. Though they do a great job with adding content (again, for free), the 
content does tend to be largely more of the same with different graphics 
and storylines.

2. One aspect of having no economy is the fact that there is no cool gear 
to upgrade to or other loot to shoot for.

3. If you're used to other games, EQ for example, you might be put off by 
the fact that kill-stealing is viewed in a bit less negative light in CoH 
for whatever reason, and therefore will tend to happen more often than 
you might be comfortable with, at least at the lower to mid-levels.

I highly recommend CoH, though I do question its staying power. 
Regardless, I believe that you will easily get your money's worth and 
more. That said, I have every intention of buying EQ2 come Monday, at 
which point my CoH account might well be deactivated. ;)
