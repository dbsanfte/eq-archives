Well, there's the camp that drops the componentless levitate spell!

I wish they'd just add ladders to the basement dropoffs. Give people a
chance to climb up into a wing without jumping through hoops or
bringing a rogue along. Hopefully they'll upgrade the level of mobs a
bit, except for South and East(?) wing, there were already a lot of
light blues there at 60.

Hmm, they fixed the gating roamers in DN? I haven't been back in over
6 months, we spent so much time there that I got pretty burned out on
the zone.

If you crawl in deep, a surprisingly large portion of that zone is
above water. Adding decent drops to the named there would be a big
improvement. You've got a nice haste belt off of fellspine and
wavecrasher/drums off of the named elemental that (I think) is a
random pop. Killing lvl 60+ named and seeing them drop trash just
doesn't seem right.

It's been well over a year since any of the Rock Golems were
unmezzable. I do hope they make some decent changes to that zone, it
was always one of my favorites.
