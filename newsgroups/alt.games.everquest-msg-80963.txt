Amazing.

My former web host provider, Verio (which was best.com until Verio
bought them) was recently bought by Earthlink, and the service went to
shit.  

Went to Verio's web site, and it tells you you can cancel on your
web-based account control panel, but the cancel button has been
removed from it.

Sent in an email asking them to cancel, and it took 3 days for the
AUTORESPONDER to answer back, telling me a human would check into the
matter and get back to me.

I live overseas, so phoning them isn't an option.  Guess I'll just
tell the credit card company to not pay 'em.
