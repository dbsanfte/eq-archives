Certainly . We are entirely capable of reducing every Islamic nation to ash
and molten glass . There is a significant minority of our people who think
that would be just a grande idea. Are you saying that nothing less will get
the point accross? Personally I would rather just blow the people
responsible all to hell and gone but if you can convince me it is required
to kill all of them I am willing . Matyr and source of inspiration my ass .
