44th may be there (too high for me to worry about when I was there), but
the 29-39 ones certainly aren't (i.e. the 'research only' ones aren't, they
may well sell the normal vendor sold ones).

My wizard used to be bound there, if he still was I'd go check, but it's a
long way (and too high for my liking) for a quick wander by ;)
