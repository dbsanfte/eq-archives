Ok this is my personal rant about the language idiots who appeared out of
the woodwork last night on AB.

Firstly this is a European server, not an English one, and last time I
checked there were many more languages spoken in Europe than just English.
Personally I think it adds character to the game to hear all those different
languages being used, not to mention showing the truly worldwide appeal of a
game like Everquest. However, it really annoys me to hear those cries of
"Use English", or "This game is English, use English language, take those
foreign languages to tells".

Am I the only one who sees this as a very bigoted and europhile approach?
What makes it worse is that these people are more than likely from the UK
like myself. I can understand that many people dont speak those other
languages, I dont myself, but if you dont understand what someone is saying
in game it's safe to assume it doesn't apply to you.

Before any of you assume anything about me, I am English and very patriotic,
but I also have room to respect the culture and language from other
countries and races. My wife is Mexican, she speaks English fluently in
addition to her native Spanish language, I see it as my responsibility to at
least make the effort to learn some of her language. Unfortunately many
English speakers think everyone else should make the effort to speak English
in exclusion to everything else.
