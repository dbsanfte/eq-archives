We have XP, too, on all three of our computers. On
'my' computer, the system has been flaky ever since
we got it. Our son's computer (a month or so newer
than mine) has been just fine. After a year and a half
of regular problems, we think we've *finally* figured
out that a big part of our problem has been a faulty
ribbon connector <??> to the hard drive. Or, at least,
the last few times it's flaked out, reseating the ribbon
has brought it back to life.

So, I guess what I'm saying is that, anecdotally, XP
is less of a problem in our house than the difference
in the 'hard' parts of our systems.
