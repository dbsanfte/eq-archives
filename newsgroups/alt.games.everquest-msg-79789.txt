Not a record, but I had a hell of a good one Tuesday night. Tiru and I
were in Permafrost because I had stupidly forgotten to get the Block of
Permafrost for my Epic. (DOH!). We went down, wiped out the king room
goblins and started pulling giants out of the next room. Diplomat and
the first "Ice Giant" were no problem. On the next one, the door to
Vox's hallway opened and one of *Those* Ice Giants came out with the one
I pulled. Fought them for a while, but it became obvious it would take
too long and more CHeals than she had to get them both down. And by
then, of course, the King Room has respawned and the gobs were
annoyingly even shooting off heals on the giants. I decided that
discretion was the better part of valor and asked her to shoot off one
last CHeal and gate. (Bound right outside the dungeon.) Then I ran for
it. My plan was to just get well away from the giant's area and Goblin
King before dying, and she could just come in and rez me and we could
try the pull differently. No clue how, Innoruuk must have been watching
over me, but I made it all the way to the zone line with two Ice giants,
the entire King Room spawn, and all the goblins from there to the gate
on my ass. Fortunately, as usual (unless a Vox raid is going down) we
were the only two in the zone, so I didn't wipe anybody out.

We went back after medding and healing, did the same pull, but killed
the small giant first while the big one was still beating on me. He
dropped the block of permafrost and I then proceeded to pull the SAME
train to the zone again, minus one giant. Didn't die once either, and
got my epic piece to boot.
