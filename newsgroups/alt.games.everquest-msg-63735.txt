Ok........ this one's probably going to be *really* stupid. When I first
set up our two computer LAN type arrangement here at home to play EQ
together, I also (somehow) set it up so both computers could "see" each
other over the LAN through Network Neighborhood, with permission to
share files, print, etc.  Last night, as I mentioned, we had to reformat
the Gateway's hard drive. Now I can't establish the link between
computers, and since we used my HD to store a lot of backup files for
the Gateway, intending to move them back over, this is a serious PITA.

I've checked to make sure that both are identifed with a Workgroup name
that is identical. Each computer has the same "name" as it had before.
Both are Window's 98SE operating system with the same 10/100 ethernet
card in them. The card's attach to a simple hub which then goes to our
cable modem. Aside from the reformat on the Gateway, nothing has
changed, hardware or software wise. Any tips on how idiots can quickly
set up their LAN again so the two machines talk once more?
