wouldn't let me equip items my character bought:
'your class, deity, and/or race may not equip that item'

Thats weird. I checked the web pages and a fourth level half-elf
warrior should be able to wear leather robe and leather sleeves. I
was trying to improve ac.

Could it be the character's level ?

Character is wearing the same thing, in cloth. I even unequiped the
cloth items and then tried again with the leather items. Still got
the same message.

Thanks,
JimP.
