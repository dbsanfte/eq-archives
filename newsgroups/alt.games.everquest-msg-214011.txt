Sure, but of course when get more levels, you can also kill higher
level mobs because you can effectively group (and thus are desired) in
higher level zones.  The only reason to stay at 62 then, is if you
really wanted to remain in the tier one zones and occaisionally find a
level 57 mob or hope for a factory/castle group.  (or if you are
addicted to Veksar or whatever).

The minute you decide to get "real" experience at "your" level, being
65 will generally make the AA's go by faster...depending on the
situation, *much* faster.

I still don't see how that matter unless you are purposefully limiting
yourself to mobs under level 60.
