*rolls eyes*

Do me a favor: go to http://www.biyee.net/v/color_vision_test/ and run
through the tests for a while, especially the deuteranopia test and
the protanopia test (tritanopia is for blue deficient, the rare one)
and tell me what you get on each of them. 
(They don't have an end point, you just get a more reliable percentage
the more panels you answer. Oh, and closest color means closest hue,
not brightness)
