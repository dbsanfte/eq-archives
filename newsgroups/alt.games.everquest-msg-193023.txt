Yeah but the game is full of so much misinformation from players that anyone
new will always pick things up like this. At least he is questioning these
rumours.

I remember some of the doozies I was fed when I started, like;
The more hits you take to kill an animal (bear,wolf, cat) the lower quality
pelt you get
Dex makes you hit more often (still hear this now)
Dex makes you attack faster (this is in an old guide that came out around
the time of RoK!)
Corpses of Mobs lying un looted will slow down the respawn of new mobs
(still hear this today)
Drowning doesn't cause Exp loss....Not sure if there was EVER the case but I
guarantee you it has been since just before RoK.
as well as the same crap about levels effecting (newbie) mob drops, which I
heard not long before the release of Luclin.
