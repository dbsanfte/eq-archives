Yeah, I was actually happy about dying, I was hoping for another skill
raise.  Though I did get to see a raise last night off an umbrous toiler in
ME (192 defense, 791 ac)

Yeah, I've got a frog crown for resists, I wouldn't mind a woven grass
headband either, but I'd also go for an Elysian crown.

If you get a lot of root breaks, the Warden symbol is actually better since
it saves you mana, just as long as you either have enough room to move
around a bit or can take the hits for a moment (which I do on purpose for
defense raises)

mmm.... Treant Tear...
Actually, assuming that you could find a wizard to port you up there, the
Thunder Spirits on isle 1 should be soloable by you, and do drop the earring
(don't touch the princess though)

Why take a ranger?   Just kill all the animals you can find to clean up the
spawn table.

Also, there's a new way to get the 6th shawl that removes sirens from the
picture, 2 velium bits and a sandalwood in a forge (shouldn't take more than
5 tries with mediocre smithing anyways) make the exact same "spool of sacred
coldain thread" that you need for making shawl 6 that comes from the siren
hair/manticore mane/giant beard/wolf whisker combo, granted, the sandalwood
costs about 100pp, and if you brew the coldain velium tempers yourself,
that's about 8pp each for the velium bits, but it's a LOT cheaper than
killing those damn sirens.

At least they gave you a nice cloak, I wouldn't say no to a free one either.

Maybe so, but it's still an upgrade unless you've got 255 wis already.

Yeah, I was thinking it had a lot less wis/mana than it did, I'd probably do
the same as you if I had one.

Heh, yeah, particularly with the RoV not even working...

I saw somebody mentioning legs rotting in the global auction channel, I wish
I could've gotten those, but I was in the Grey at the time, and before I
knew how to get through ME to UP.

You should be able to kill Elysians solo for the legs if you wanted to.

I'd go for a tali of benevolence too.

You're fortunate not to live on the same server as the 'team', I cheer every
time I see them bitch about getting KSed on Lodizal.
