The largest cause of accidents is being male.
Second largest cause of accidents is being young.

Source of information - most any insurance agency.

Now, here's a nice bit of info from Colorado, for all crashes attended

by the cops in 2000:

Cause of Crash                      Percent 
Inattentive to Driving                  22.4% 
Exceeding Safe Speed            14.2% 
Animal Caused                         10.7% 
Following Too Closely               8.4% 
Lane Violations                           8.1% 
DUI-Alcohol                                 6.2% 
Failed to Yield Right of Way       5.1% 
Exceeding Legal Speed            2.5% 
Wrong Side of Road                     .8% 

An important thing to note here is the difference between "exceeding
safe speed" and "exceeding legal speed".  You can be doing 20 MPH and
be exceeding the safe speed, if the conditions are bad enough.  *Pure*
speed crashes would be the "exceeding legal speed" crashes.

I was surprised to note how low DUI was; I figured it would be higher.
Especially as DUI is the noted cause for 31% of all motorcycle
fatalities in their data.

Actually, speed is a major factor in *results*, not in *cause*.
Rarely is the accident *caused* by speed; speed increases the amount
of damage once the accident happens.  *Cause* is things like driver
intattentiveness, illegal maneuvers, et cetera.  Speed exacerbates
what happens afterwards.

So, of all cars involved in casualty-causing accidents, 68% were
exceeding the speed limit.  Of all cars not involved in accidents, 42%
were exceeding the speed limit.

Of course, without actual speed information, the "generally travelling
faster" statement goes right out the window.  Based on the above
information, we don't know what the average speed of the casualty
vehicles was, neither do we know the average speed of the control
vehicles.  "Generally travelling faster" means nothing.  It especially
doesn't indicate *how much faster*.

Note that they give no information whatsoever on how many cars *under*
60 KPH were involved in casualty-causing accidents.  As a matter of
fact, examination of the report shows that they blew off everything
happening at or under the posted speed limit of 37 MPH.

Also, their criteria for selecting accidents was explicitly
"casualty-causing".  No casualty (ambulance), no accident.  Now, given
that increased speed = increased damage (NOT cause, but effect), this
disproportionately cuts off all possible low-speed accidents where the
people involved don't require an ambulance.

Further, no information is given in regards to the road where this
test was done. I can show you a 50 KPH zone in Calgary which is tight,
windy, has several feeder roads, and has trees all over the place;
prime accident territory.  I can show you another piece that's also 50
KPH, 4 lanes wide with a median, dead straight, and has no feeder
roads at all.  Which do you think will show the higher accident rate?

Now, this shows a problem with people driving significantly in excess
of the posted speed limit, not a problem with speed per se.  So, to
make the report more valid in re "speed causes accidents" they need to
do the exact same thing again, but this time using a stretch of road
with a, say, 100 KPH or higher speed limit.  They also need to redo it
on the original material, and include *all* accidents, not just the
ones requiring an ambulance trip for somebody.

Something else to note is that they selected their case vehicles
always post-crash, then subselected only for those that they could
easily do a simulation on to derive a believed speed.  The control
vehicles selected were selected on a "random" basis, but they provide
no information on how they were randomly selected.  This has a very
important bearing on the relationship between the control and case
vehicles.

It's an interesting document, biz, but it really requires a complete
read-through.

Again, speed rarely *causes* accidents.  However it alway increases
the *results*.
