It's not that I have problems when I pull - it is that I am not allowed
to pull.  When I am soloing and I want one solo mob out of a bunch of
them I can use stalk to pick the one I want and not get any adds.  If I
didn't have stalk I would have to get closer and have a higher risk of
adds.  This is the position that the tank is in - as far as I know they
do not have the ability to pull something from the range that I have.
I know that I can pick one mob (or group) out of a number of close
together mobs.  This ability would be useful in Nek as those groups of
Dragoons do seem to stand near each other.
