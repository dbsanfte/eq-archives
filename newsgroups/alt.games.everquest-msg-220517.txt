Boohoo...

And if the 'assist' function wasn't already there you'd probably be 
crying about how lame and dumbing it down it was that you could just 
assist a target to see what he was attacking. After all even without 
/assist there are ways of figuring it out... if you were truly not a 
stupid handicapped incompetent you wouldn't need /assist....

Give me a break. That you need any 'skill' at all for this is 
ridiculous. Some things *should* be obvious. The ability to discern 
wether you are about to pigstick a mezzed mob or a rampaging one is one 
of those things. You shouldn't have to dodge around the problem to 
figure it out.

Next you'll be telling us how rendering the screen in 3d really dumbed 
it down, and how much more 'skill' it would take to play using a text 
based interface...

You must be very proud. Everquest is the first game I've ever played 
where anyone with there eyes open could have even a possibility of not 
knowing.

I know people who can play a game of chess from just a list of moves... 
QxB, P-K2, PxP... but that's a clumsy interface to play from. You can 
improve it using a checkers set... and you can improve it still further 
using an actual chess set with differentiated pieces... none of these 
steps dumbs down chess... the game itself didn't get any easier; it just 
got easier to interact with. Nobody has ever been called a stupid 
handicapped incompetent chess player because they preferred to play 
chess with 'visual aids' (e.g. a chess set).
