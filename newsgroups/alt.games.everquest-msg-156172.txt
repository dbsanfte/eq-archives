I have been playing EQ for well over a year now, and think of my self
as pretty knowledgeable. However, I don't understand how Mutli
Questing works (I have never asked ingame either, didn't want the
d00dz giving me grief) and was hoping someone could take a moment to
explain it to me.

Thanks in advance.
