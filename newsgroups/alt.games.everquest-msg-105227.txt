Bugger, well, I guess I could just hold mini quests and give them away but
the problem there is it's normally the loudest newbie that inadvertedly gets
the attention. I liked the ability to leave presents for newbies on mobs -
it rewards the hard working newbies in a way that doesn't identify your
character as a potential mark for the buff/begger whores.

Oh well - there's <always> a plan B.....  : )
