Speaking as a programmer...

Sometimes the "big fish" require a good deal of time. Not active
programming time, but more of a "back-off-and-let-it-stew" time. At
any given moment I've got several of these kinds of coding problems
brewing at the back of my mind.

That doesn't mean I completely freeze on other work, though. If there
are easy-to-implement items on the list, there's no reason to ignore
them in the meantime.
