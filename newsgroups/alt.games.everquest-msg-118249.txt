A killer combination and I really wish I'd thought of it back in the day
when my wife started her shammy and I started a monk. I now have met a
husband wife team in an ally guild of ours who play a troll Shammy/SK
duo. They've been doing it for 52 levels and they still never need to go
looking for a group. They hold the entrance to the hole by themselves
quite nicely with virtually zero deaths. If things go south, the SK
holds them off while the shammy gates outside, then the SK feigns, or
failing that, swims for the zone. A well equipped SK can have great AC
and HP, right up with many warriors, and as you say can out-taunt nearly
ANY warrior when they wish. They're both great on raids too.
