I was looking at eqatlas.com today, and noticed something, well, odd.

In Shadeweaver's Thicket, off of PC, there is a zone connection that says 
"To an Unknown Zone"

Does anyone know what this "mystery zone" is?  I'm assuming that it is a 
zone connection for something that was left out of the Luclin expansion, 
or something along those lines.  I'm thinkingof taking one of my alts 
(that I rarely play so it won't matter what happens) and exploring this 
zone connection, but thought I'd put the question to the group here and 
get some thoughts.  Anyway, it's of no major importance...I just got 
curious about it.  *IF* I ever actually go check it out, I'll post my 
findings here, provided they're anything other than "it's a dead end".
