Hardly, it's a dig on all those fuckwits who insisted that they be the
first one to get <fill in the blank> basically making a total ass of
themselves when within a matter of weeks, we were letting components
rot.

Give it a few weeks, there's a point in the curve when things just
snowball.  You have that painful period when you're figuring out how
to do things, spending a lot of time dying and doing CR.  Then after
some event or another, things just "click" and suddenly you're plowing
through the zone.  Every guilds reaches this point if they stick with
it long enough.  We were there as well.  We repeatedly (and I do mean
REPEATEDLY) failed against Velketor of all mobs.  But we figured it
out and now he's a chump.

There's no hidden secret or "elite tactic".

Like I said, there's a point when things snowball.
It used to take us 2 full days to clear ToVN.  We do it now in 8 hours
on patch cycles (the last few days when things got stable enough to
actually raid has been great since we've been raking in Vulak loots).

Every guild organized enough and dedicated enough will reach this
point.  

The only thing that really seperates "uber" guilds and non-uber guilds
is the organization.  Killing shit is easy.  Managing 50+ people day
in and day out is incredibly painful.
