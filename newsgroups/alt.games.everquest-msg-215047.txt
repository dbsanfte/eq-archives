"Rant mode on"

The most annoying phrase that I constantly hear in EQ is "PLZ".   AKA, pls
or please.  This phrase usually accompanies various levels of whining,
begging, pleading, groveling, etc.  Its like Oliver Twist on crack.

PLZ, can I have money
PLZ, can I have weapons
PLZ, can I have buffs
PLZ, sir, can I have more......

This seems to come mostly from people starting an char and don't want to do
any work to lvl themselves.  Or seeing all their friends (do they really
have them?) being Twinked up the wahzoo.

A couple of things happen to me when I first started EQ.  One, I didn't know
what buffs were, like anyone else just starting, and I didn't get one until
my char was lvl 7.  This was from a cleric who came across my very damaged
body and heal me without me asking.  Thanking her, we both went on our ways.
I thought that was pretty cool and have tried to help newbies who are in a
really tough fight whenever I see them.

Second, while wandering in through a zone that was way over my head at lvl
9, a warrior happen by and gave me a really good weapon and a couple of HP
rings.  Now whenever I am upgrading my equipment, I look for someone who
doesn't know what an ALT or MAIN is to give stuff to.  Someone new to the
game, who could use a little help.

While I'm in rant mode another annoy thing is newbies who hail you and just
stand there waiting for you to do something.  I have had people standing in
front of me at 25% HP, automatically expecting me to heal and buff JUST
because they hail me.  After a couple of times, some without even a thank
you, I started to add names to the IGNORE list.  This is a social game, not
Mind Reading 101, talk to me.

And my favorite, was the newbie that asked me to help track some mobs, hit
them a few times and then said I could kill him now, he would still get XP.
Maybe I should have just sat at his keyboard and lvl'd his char until he was
ready to play.

Some simple rules for EQ.
1) Fight your own fights, either solo or as a group.  Power lvl'ing means
you won't learn good skills or tactics that will help at higher lvls.  And
by the way, you might meet some new people with every new char you create.

2) If you don't have it, earn it.  Kill things, isn't that the point.  Mobs
are the ones that have the money and the equipment, its where most people
get their stuff from.  And SURPRISE, you get XP for it too!

3) If you need assistance, ask and say thank you.  If you need a lvl 65
char, because all your friends (do you really have them?) have one, go
bother your friends for it.

4) Explore.  EQ is a big place with a lot of stuff to see.  I see chars'
sitting in one zone lvl'ing and then moving to the next zone to lvl.  They
become experts at killing maybe a dozen types of mobs, when there are
hundreds.  I have been hunting in some zones for hours, collecting stuff for
tradeskills, and never see anyone.



Finally, AAARRRRGGGHHHH. Sorry, had to be done.
