I'd say the fact that they can do it to a raid-level mob in one blast
(from each member of the group) does make it worse. KSing raid level
mobs in general is a more serious matter, IMO, than KSing your
standard 6-man xp groups. Normally your standard xp groups don't
require days or even weeks of planning and gathering forces and don't
pay off with equivalent loot...

I just see manaburn, as it is now, open for grief play in a way that
is fixable, hence the upcoming nerf. It'll still be useful, as far as
I can see. It just means that a group of wizards can't vaporize an
end-game challenge right out of the gates...
