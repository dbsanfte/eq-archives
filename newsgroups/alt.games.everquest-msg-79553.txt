Get the Everquest Trilogy.  Shadows of Luclin is an expansion that cannot
play without the original.  The Trilogy gives you ample opportunity to try
the game out without too large an investment.

However, make sure your machine is capable of running the game before you
spend the money on it.

We love it so much, we not only bought the Luclin expansion, but also two
new computers so we could play it without problems like horrid lag and so
forth.. hehe

What?  I AM NOT addicted!  LOL!
