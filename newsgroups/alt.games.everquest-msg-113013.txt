That is because trade skills soak up money and time.

I have heard of one newbie fletcher that made a bit of cash after he found
several players that wanted to be steady customers for arrows. Smithing is
about the same, you can contract out for metal bits and studs to higher
level players. Brewing you could do it with Heady Kolas<sp?> for people
making Wu's armor. I would really *find a buyer* before I try any of those
since if you have to sell back to the NPCs you will lose money.

Just a ball park figure for trade skills like smithing or jewelry is you had
better have about 800 pp to put into it before you start. I don't twink a
lot so as my characters were in lower levels I would buy things like +2 int
rings for a couple of pp each. I think I am the exception since everyone
twinks every character they use.

When you have the 800 pp to put into them, you may want to think about what
equipment you could buy and what effect that would have on your rate of
leveling.

Baking is ok in that you need a lot less to get started and into profitable
range. I think at about 130 skill you can roughly double your money each
round of purchasing items from NPCs. I have heard that monks will buy stacks
of cooked fish+batwing because of weight considerations but I have never
seen it in game.

Tailoring is ok because you can raise it at break cost even to master level,
but seems more like a lifetime commitment. You train with your guildmaster
to 21 skill level then spend the rest of the characters EQ life hunting hide
bearing or silk producing animals. You would make more money killing stuff
that drops bronze weapons.
