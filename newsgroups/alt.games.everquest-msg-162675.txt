I find the reverse of this is true.  I need warriors now more than ever,
and I need them as high level as I can find.  A mere 60 warrior simply
doesn't cut it any more, his mitigation is too low, his HP total is too
low, I need someone who can accept a very very serious pounding.

Likewise, a warrior needs a cleric now.  It was getting to the point where
a shaman or druid made a fine healer for the high level out trying to make
some experience... but not any more.  You WILL be socked so hard on initial
pull that you'll need CE or SR to survive it, and you will be taking so
much damage even from slowed mobs that Cheal, and I don't mean Incomplete
Heal, is the only mana efficient answer.

This will be solved, of course, and as with every other expansion, clerics
and warriors will be trivialized.... but right now our two classes are back
in the driver's seat, a "must have" for any decent group.

As a cleric, I benefitted enourmously from level 61, with the vendor spell
Supernal Remedy.  Half again the heal in 2/3rds the time for the same mana
as my previous fast heal... fantastic upgrade.  There was literally no AA I
could earn that would have come close, leveling to 61 ASAP was a great
move.  While getting from 61 to 62, I got more worthwhile spell upgrades,
and still more getting to 63, and there are still 61/62 spells I don't have
yet.  As a cleric, I don't regret getting to 62.

What I do regret, in a way, is getting to 63.  Now I'm reduced to sitting
in PoJ doing trials again and again until one day I happen accross a pickup
group that is capable of (or just lucky enough to) pass.

Early on (my first 30 or 40 trials) I can say that quite a few of them
failed because of me.  I say that because NOW I know what to do, and I
wasn't doing it then.  So when I'd run OOM, or get killed, it was often my
own fault, bad tactics at work.

However, I haven't gone under 50% mana in a trial since that point, I'm
meleeing almost every mob, its really not me thats blowing the trials
anymore, its the fact that we have a random assortment of pickup people,
most of whom have never passed a trial, and well, it shows.

I'll pass eventually, just because the luck of the draw will eventually get
me a group of good people who work well enough together to pull this off...
or because my guild mates in europe will finally get their copies and I'll
be able to field an actual good group on purpose.

But until that point, I'm going to be a paper 63  (or heck, the way I'm
going, a paper 64) with the level but none of the abilities.

Bergh

ps I'll tell you what, I get a lot closer to beating a trial with a
randomly selected 63 warrior than I do with a really good 60 warrior.
Why?  I don't know, but I suspect, as was certainly true from 1 to 60, that
level matters a lot more than you'd think when it comes to a tank.
