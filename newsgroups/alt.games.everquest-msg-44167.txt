Short races can squeeze in without problems.
Large races will need to be shrunk or have a rogue open the door for
them if they don't have a key.

The key is no drop.

You can zone out, but squeezing through the "locked" door is easier
going in than coming out.

Remember, the zoneline is underwater.

At level 51, you can single pull the entry way stuff.  They are
usually elemental warriors which are about level 38 to 41.  Once you
get past the 6 elemental warriors up front, you have the potential for
running into an elemental crusader.  These are about 3 levels higher
and cannot be single pulled at 51, can be if you're higher level.

The 6 at the entry way are on a fast enough timer that a soloing level
51 player (or a duo) can keep them cleared with just a little bit of
downtime.
