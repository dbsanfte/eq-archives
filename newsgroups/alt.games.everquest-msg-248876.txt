An accurate description, but the fact is that it *does* work, or at 
least it <can> and is working on some servers. But who it works for is 
the raiding guilds. But not just the top one or two per server - I'm 
talking about all the guilds who are capable of mounting a sustained 
raiding force at any level. (Yes, I know, that's hardly a majority... 
I'll get to the rest of you shortly.)

As each expansion adds new top end content, the top tier guilds move up 
to that and start trying to work it out. This opens up opportunities for 
guilds just below them to have more chances at moving into the content 
they just vacated (or at least don't dominate as much) and so on down 
the line.

Our server has three guilds that have killed Quarm, two more in Time 
trying to get to Quarm, probably six in the Elementals, and a bit more 
than that still working the top end of Luclin and the lower to middle 
PoP bosses. Below them, believe it or not, we have smaller, newer 
raiding guilds who are fighting over Velious content. Hell, an argument 
recently broke out on the boards over ToV North!

Point is, that when the top 3 guilds started having GoD to work on, plus 
their Time Raids, there was no longer any time or boredom to bother 
being in the elementals. This opened up new opportunities for the guilds 
trying to get in there to have a shot at EP bosses and work out their 
strats. This likewise freed up time for the guilds below them to ahve a 
shot at Emp, Seru, and VT, etc. and so on down the line. And the gear 
filters down (at least the tradable stuff)along with higher levels, more 
AA's, strats being published, etc. etc. making it easier for those that 
follow to beat the content.

The top end raiding guilds are the only ones who have seen it *ALL*, and 
to boot, they had to do it all initially using gear from the last 
expansion and no ready printed out strats on everything from the web. So 
I can see where their input would be invaluable in terms of "What Do We 
Need To Fix, Guys?"  If they truly plan on listening, and more to the 
point, actually DOING SOMETHING about what they hear, then they will get 
priceless feedback from these guys, assuming their reps don't blow this 
chance.

(Note: Our guild is in the VT rotation and have not gotten any higher 
than Agnarr in PoP, so I'm not speaking defensively from the Tier one 
perspective. But I *have* come to appreciate how it works.)

Sadly, this leaves out all of the people who are career soloers, or 
"just group with your friends" types, or in family style, non-raiding 
guilds, and all the other casual players who don't have the play time to 
be in a sustained raiding guild. What about them?

This is a problem in the process of these interviews. I think people in 
those situations DO run into problems with the game that the raidaholics 
don't run into. Or at least don't run into as often, and likely isn't 
enough of a priority to bring it up compared to high end raiding issues.

Having reps from the top couple guilds on each server was a good idea. 
However, I think they should have a separate meeting with reps from some 
of the larger (by numbers) family type, non-raiding guilds also. That 
could give them some insight into issues being faced from folks living 
on the other side of the street from the full time raiders.
