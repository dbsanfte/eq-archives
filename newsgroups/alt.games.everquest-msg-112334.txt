Someone told me that the Fungus Patch vest is actually not that rare of a
drop in the triggered quests, and that it is cheaper than Fungi tunic. Of
course, it could have been that they were telling me this so that I'd sell
them my un-used fungi tunic (I keep hoping they'll make it vah shir
wearable).  But...does anyone have any experience with this drop?  If
there were as many in teh game as there are fungis, I'm sure it would be
cheaper than fungi (due to fungi being useable by many more classes, in
particular monks).  

I have assumed, however, that they are rare.
