Well, I am a pretty skeptical person, and I have seen a UFO...of course 
i *think* it was a meteorite, but have no proof of it....so I did see an 
UNDENTIFIED flying object. Never claimed it was an alien craft=)

Big whonking difference between considering yourself a skeptic and being 
gullible...most skeptical people wouldnt believe it was raining unless 
they see it themselves...

Now, am I skeptical becuse I saw something I cant identify but think is 
sonething very real, or am I gulible for not trying determine if it was 
a meteorite through it being very late and all i wanted to do was go to bed?
