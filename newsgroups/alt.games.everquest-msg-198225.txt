Definitely in favor of this, though one question remains: if an uber 
person  wanted to push their level 46 twink through trials, could they 
then get them into tier 2?  ie: will you be able to circumvent these 
restrictions by going through the old channels?  If so, the tier 2 
requirement seems a little low.  It could probably be raised to 58 or so 
without too many complaints.  XP still flows quickly in tier 1 at that 
level in a lot of camps.

This would just kick a lot of ass.  I think SOE is finally acknowledging 
that it's really trivial to xfer items between alts, they're just 
removing the requirement of finding someone you trust who's willing to 
stick to one spot for a few minutes.

This is interesting.  Think I'll have to fire up my test copy and see 
what kinda items I get ;)
