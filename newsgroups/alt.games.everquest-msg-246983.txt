I think it's basically an issue where people are expecting better service
from a more 'mature' industry... It's really hard to hold (from a management
perspective) guides or what have you accountable when guides are volunteer
idiots that applied via a form and got interviewed in tells.

SWG and FF both have better 'volunteer' systems in place, imho. You want to
become a newbie helper (with no special powers, mind you), click your
checkbox in your character profile. In FF, you go talk to an npc, you just
have to have a certain level and number of hours played. Then you can change
into a 'mentor', and expect to answer questions (and begs for loot, but you
get that anyway, right?).
Me, I hate people, I answer stupid questions all day at work on the phone,
and never want to join anything like a guide program. No mentor/helper for
me, thank you.

Leave 'tech support' to the people who are (work with me here, I know this
is going to have you rolling on the floor) trained for the job and know what
they are doing. Which means the UO, AO, DAoC, EQ, and from what I understand
(never used them) FF GM's can all go home now, k thx. (the SWG support staff
has, on the other hand, helped me out in every situation I've ever asked for
help with. Though I think it may be that I know which battles to fight, and
which to just concede defeat with. There were a lot of concessions there.)

I mean, you gotta realize. I've had people call me up at the ISP I work at
for help with the fact that they died due to a bug in AC.

<boogle>

Sorry.. I gotta stop this now before it devolves into (further)
senselessness
