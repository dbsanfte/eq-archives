Well, I had fog until the last patch in Netherbian on both my 
gimp computers, not sure what my laptop has cardwise, but it is a 
2 year old HP ze4100 and my desktop *had* a gforce mx440 in it 
last time I was in neth thursday morning, and after the patch no 
fog. Not sure where that falls on the data graph=)
