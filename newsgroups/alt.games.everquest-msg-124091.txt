    And they certainly paid for it with enough deaths. =)

    Snip tactic. Not surprisingly, Wraith tried this *once* with us on
Tormax. They had about 12 people milling about the ramp, waiting for
reinforcements to log on (not arrive, log on). So we called the pull in
shout, ooc, and auction - "You have two minutes before Tormax is pulled to
WL zone through whoever and whatever is in the way." The ones that stayed
became speedbumps. Now, when Wraith wants something they do what we do -
they set up a sufficient force in the zone in advance.

    *shrug* I can't agrue the point, because I agree with you. But we've had
GMs watch us do it, and there was no problem with it. So at least to the
people making the rules, it's an appropriate way to engage perma-rooted
mobs. I believe they take that view because with other mobs, you can debuff
them while pulling them / to pull them and perma-rooting takes away that
valid option. And yes, there's at least one high-end mob that we debuff as
we pull - that isn't just an "in theory" idea. =)

> Im not sure why they rooted all ntov lords and ladies

    I think it had something to do with people training them and/or fighting
them in places where the breath weapons would be totally nullified. Vyemm is
the only dragon now I can think of where clerics don't have a place to hide
from the AoE, though. And even he isn't so bad if you position right. I find
that if I wedge myself in one corner, between my one AA point in Channeling
and my +10% Channeling boots I can consistently get off a CH through the
AoE. I have to be in that corner, so I go straight up and down, but I can do
it. So I CH the main tank while others all use fast heals.

    So you have to actually bring debuffers with you! =) It also makes you
do things to manage aggro. If you use the easiest way, debuffers have to
camp after debuffing - and then you don't know when a debuff fades except by
the effects, or if you use stopwatches.

    We don't do that. The other top guild on our server does dodgy things
like this on rare occasions - they used to use the focus stacking bug on
their warriors, and once they warped Vyemm on top of Aaryonar's spawn point
(and left him there for the next guild's NToV rotation, LOL). Our view has
always been that these bugs will be fixed, so we might as well do it without
exploiting the bug and then we'll be fine when it is fixed. We don't see
perma-rooted mobs being changed.

    He always was. Vulak was just a long, boring fight. I was part of what
turned out to be the last Vulak killing on the server - took 30 minutes.
Tanks were going AFK, one cleric nearly fell asleep, etc. No challenge, no
"OMFG can we do this", just sheer boredom. Compare that with another fight
we do that is the same length - Vyzh'dra the Cursed. Because he charms (and
because he can warp at times), the fight is always uncertain. If he charms
the warriors on him, he's just lost ALL aggro on them and we have a real
fight to get him back under control before he kills every caster and ranger
we have. And there's always the danger that a caster could get charmed and
start nuking a hole through the main tanks - it's the only fight we do where
I know I'll be attacked by at least one of my guildmates. =)

    Our warriors have at a minimum a SoD, and most have a BoC or Hategiver.
The monks don't get aggro. The only melees we have with aggro problems are
one overly-aggressive shadow knight (he gets given offtank duty or told to
cool it), and a rogue with I believe a Tendonslicer (the snare-proccing 16
DAM thing). The rogue has just about had it with that weapon, too.
