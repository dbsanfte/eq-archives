Have you done the math again since the DOT change?  Root/Rot
seems like a waste of mana (gotta keep re-rooting) when you
no longer need to keep mobs stationary in order to get full DOT
damage.  Can you usefully spend the extra mana using DD to
speed the kill up?  I know that I personally use rot and nuke
tactics instead, even if it does turn out to be a bit less efficient;
true kiting like this is far more enjoyable for me than the sit
nervously waiting for root to break plan... of course since my
cleric can only solo via root/DD, my willingness to suffer thru
root on another character is quite limited
