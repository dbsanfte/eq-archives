Sounds like a pathing issue. I am not a beastlord, I play a mage but you
figure out pretty quickly that all pets have the same pathing as the mobs
and until you figure out the pathing in a particular room you will want to
be very careful.
No way to fix it unless verants wants to do some changes that they haven't
done since the game was released. Just learn to deal with the pathing of
pets. In some areas its not even worth dragging my pet along for the fight,
the pathing is so terrible that it can bring alot of mobs down on you.
Nothing more embarrassing than to have a runaway pet bring death upon your
group.
Tips to help:
1) tell your pet to sit and pull to your pet.
2) know your zone, if you can get an invis watch the pathing of the local
mobs, pets have a similar pathing if not identical
3) park the pet on the mob that gives you pathing nightmares spawn site and
tell it to sit or guard depending on the zone
4) lastly if you get too frustrated fight outdoors, more room to work in and
fewer issues overall (not always though)

Good luck
