Did you jumpstart new skills with at least 1 point when you got them?
Some skills like dodge, parry, specialization, etc will not go up
until you put at least 1 training point into them. If you did this,
then the points you have stored up can be used for tradeskills,
languages, etc. You don't have to spend them at all if you don't want
to.
