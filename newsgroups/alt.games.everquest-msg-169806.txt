But so many of the game rules and class balance change at 50, it seems like
a different game. They should fix it so levels 1-50 also get balanced out
better. Also many of the classes need fixing prior to level 50... but they
have left many things broken for months and even years in some cases. Seems
VI also only concentrate on "high level content".
