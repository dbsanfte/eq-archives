Sometimes, when you camp out on the dock, you can re-enter the
game on the boat (wherever it may be).

That happened to me once in Freeport, and I wasn't even
camped really near the spot where the boat arrives.  I camped out
near the stone wall that backs the dock, and when I came back
in, I was on the boat in the Ocean of Tears.

I don't even want to know what sort of bizarre program code
could produce behavior like that...
