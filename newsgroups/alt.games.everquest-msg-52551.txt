I didn't respond to it because I didn't feel it warrented a response.  An
economy that supports trade skills and one that supports hunting mobs are
not mutually exclusive.  Nothing of the kind.  The notion that they are is
simply silly.

This is true what you say regarding prestige and meaning.  For those players
who enjoy camping for hours upon hours to obtain these items, then this
system is fine.  I take it that you are one of those players, and this too
is fine.  For those who do not enjoy this sort of gameplay, which apparantly
is a substantial percentage, there must be another solution.

*I* never said it has no economy.  I said it has a poor economy or rather a
poor economic system.

Nor did I ever say top end items should be easy to obtain.  Easy is a
subjective term however, and ideally a game should be difficult enough to be
rewarding while still being enjoyable.   There could certainly be ways to
obtain these items that, while still difficult, are much less monotonous
than 6 hour mob camps.

Everquest has an economy, and by purest definition it is a "workable"
economy because it is an economy that "works" or functions.  People trade
things and buy things and sell things.  That is an economy.  But the economy
does not support the tradeskills that are present in the game, it has
horrible descepancies in effort and reward, ungodly inflation, and lends
itself to utter saturation.  In short it is not a "workable" economy in that
it is not a "good" self-regulating economy.  No matter how much you insist
that it is.

An economic system with consumable items does not equate to a Monty Haul
system.  It is very silly for you to act as if a stable self-regulating
economic system and a system with rewarding gameplay are mutually exclusive.
They aren't.  If the designers and game players agree that 6 to 8 hour camps
are fun and make for a rewarding experience they can include those camps, if
they like.  The detioration rate simply gives the designers an extra
variable that they can tweek to adjust the value and rarity of any given
item.

Regardless if he was or not.  If the EQ economy exemplified the sort of
economy that the lead designer thought best for a game, he would use it.  EQ
is an excellent game that has made a number of mistakes from which future
games are learning, not least of which is its economic system.  SWG is the
very best example because it is being designed by the same company, though
maybe not, as you say, the same lead designer.

Of course it does, and to design a game that attracts trade skillers does
not mean designing a game that is unattractive to PvE players.  Very often
these players are one in the same, and even when they are not, all players
are attracted to an excellent, entertaining, and rewarding game, and a
stable, self-regulating, player driven economy only helps.
