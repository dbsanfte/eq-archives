That's what I get for not actually going back and looking.  OK, then it 
boosts your mana pool size for a fixed time period, seems to me to be 
pretty useless overall, given the maximum boost is now 100?  200?  Either 
way, not worth the cost of the potion.  If it were an instantaneous boost 
to your mana, I could see people wanting them, OTOH, I could see that 
being pretty unbalancing too unless they limited it to once every xx 
minutes.
