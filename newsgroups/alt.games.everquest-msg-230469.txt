Yes, the book finally showed up. It was not on the floor, but sticking 
out of the top of the desk where predicted. I commisioned a rogue to 
come pick the lock and kill the vampire.

We found a spot in Akheva to duo and kill some robes until we got two of 
the items required for the second to last turn-in. I have combined them 
and now only need the final turnin of Abrogast and Miller, and their 
subsequent murder for renigging on the deal. I'm going to try to round 
up some friends this evening for that.

Sadly, I've seen no strategies for the kill. I don't know if the other 
NPC's in that building would assist them, where we should attack, if 
they despawn after they get a few feet away, etc.  We shall see. I'll 
try to just bring enough firepower to make it a moot point.
