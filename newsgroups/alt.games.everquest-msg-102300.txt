I've been told to try Anarchy Online, and may once I finish downloading 
the .iso.  The beta's got bad reviews but all said there was so much 
potential.  Now, apparently the game is better and, like most next-gen 
MMORPG's will give EQ some stiff competition.  AO is sci-fi based, 3000 
some odd years in the future, resistance vs. massive corporation thing. 
  I guess the thing that EQ has going for it is well established player 
base and many of the quests/items have been discovered and can be had 
for a price.  I would love to see a new EQ server start from scratch, 
not just split.  Where there are no lvl 60's and everyone had to start 
from scratch.  All of a sudden, Screaming Mace is great and that being 
able to sharpen weapons becomes somewhat important.   I'm wondering if 
they can merge 2 servers and then use the extra one to do this, it would 
be cool, IMHO.
