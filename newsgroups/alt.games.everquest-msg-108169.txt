I was about to start a DE wizard and for the first time being a DE I have a
choice with a deity. Agnostc, Innoruk, or Solosek Ro. If I choose S. Ro
won't this possibly make me KOS in Neriak throughout time but however give
me a better chance for quests for items, etc...
Just for the heck of it I choose S. Ro and went to freeport but the
merchants will not sell to me yet (got kill some orcs first) and I am dub.
to the all the guards including N. Freeport. Any suggestions?
