I have found the exact opposite:  The timing on a /pause command
is EXTREMELY variable, and should not be relied upon.  It even
varies, quite repeatedly, depending on which "F10" screen mode
I'm in -- the /pause command "runs out" faster in "small
view, many menus" mode than it does in "full screen" mode.

Furthermore, it can't send "the whole macro" to the server,
since many commands are done entirely client-side (e.g., /book #
to flip pages when you're already in your spellbook).
