I spent my first two months in EQ wondering what the hell my guild were
talking about when they said they'd been raiding.

At it's most simple, raiding is doing something with more than one group of
people.

Before the planes of power expansion, raiding meant getting a bunch of
people together, setting up 2, 3, 4 or however many 6 person groups, and
then using chat channels to co-ordinate your attack on some creature or
creatures which 6 people aren't enough for.

Either there's too many of them, or they hit too hard for a single healer,
or you need to do so much damage that you need lots of damage dealing
people, etc.

One of the main issues with that, is that only one group can earn XP (there
were other issues, looting and communication amongst them).

When PoP came out - they added a formal raid tool, you still form groups,
but those groups are then amassed into a single raid.  The tool allows a
maximum of 72 people to be in a single raid (although depending on where
you're going and why, you could form say, 2 x 60 person raids if you wanted
120 people).

So, it's a collection of more than 6 people put together to take out tough
targets, dragons, giants, gods, weird alien-like beings, and annoying and
evil militia men in Freeport.

One of the consequences of releasing expansions and increasing level
limits, is that targets which once required raids, can often now be single
grouped, or killed with even fewer that 6 people.

You can raid at any level in the game, several epic items require raids.
Some expansions are targeted almost directly at raiding, PoP and GoD being
two examples, where most of the content needs raids to reach it.
