To him I would politely but firmly tell him to fuck off since he obviously
failed reading comprehension (since he didn't read your loot rules before it
started) and you can't trust his word on anything.

But, regardless, it's my opinion that augs are common enough that anyone who
can use them should roll...but if they've already won an aug during that
adventure, don't roll again unless the other people have already won augs.

Dropped items are usually MUCH nicer than augmentations, and just 'cause I
got a +6 mana item doesn't mean I should be jipped from getting a 50
damage/10 delay 1hs weapon (exaggerated on purpose but there are some REALLY
nice drops).
