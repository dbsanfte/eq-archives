Actually, there are. If you're talking of a cash pool large enough
to include cloaks of flames and fungi tunics, or one generated by
selling the same. Plenty of level 60's in my guild will raise funds
by sitting in twink level areas taking 100pp per KEI or POTG while
spending the time tradeskilling or chattering to friends - some even
EQW it and check back every so often to cast while they play around
on an alt.

I think its would be legitimate to compare the "twinking" effect
in terms of cash... lets say, <x>pp worth of items for the warrior
or purchased buffs for the caster, if we're talking about the ease of
levelling an alt.

Of course, if you're talking about the unbalancing effect of items
then hey, a fungi tunic and a manastone run cheap and work well
too. Manastones sell on my server for 15-40k depending on buyer and
seller and this is one where it never dropped; split server.
