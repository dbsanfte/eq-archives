How much are you looking to spend?  What is the system you are planning 
on putting it in?

$150 range, the Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB is excellent (about 6x the 
performance of your current  card).

$400-$500 range, the top end Radeon X800, or NVidia 6800 are both 
excellent (around 15x the performance of your current card).

For under $100, check out a Radeon 9600 pro maybe (about 3x the 
performance of your current card).

The performance boost will depend a lot on the resolution your run, and 
is not specific to everquest, but, it's a pretty decent guideline anyway 
for the differences in performance.

Personally, I have the 9800 Pro, and it is great.  I run with all options  
except shadows turned on all the time, including raids, at 1280x1024 
resolution.  Only time I have issues with framerate is on raids with lots 
of spells going simultaneously, if I am looking at the target of those 
spells.
