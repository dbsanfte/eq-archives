Hello,

I posted here about a month ago asking for help on various issues and was
glad to be greeting with many offerings and advice.  After about a month of
testing the game (I know, it takes a while for me to check out everything)
and playing a Dwarven Cleric to level 10 as a test character, I think I am
finally set to start over and play a main primary.

One of the first things I've found in the testing period is that the only
race I want to play is Human.  It simplifies things for me, eliminates race
envy (since I am a human in real life) and gives me a decent well-rounded
character for any class.  I've tried everything from the Gnome Warrior to
Iksar Monk to Wood Elf Druid and I am not happy with playing any other race
than Human it seems.

I think I have narrowed it down to a Human Warrior, Druid or Ranger... my
last hurdle.  Plus, I am still clueless as to what server to play on, lol.
I know they are essentially all the same, but I really did not enjoy the
people on Zeb for the most part.

Hopefully I will get started by tonight!
