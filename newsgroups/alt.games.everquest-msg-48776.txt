Boy do I feel sorry for you, glad I did not start off in Rivervale.
I have seen the complete opposite, I began my journey from Halas
I have seen more Roleplay in the first 2 days that the server was live
than I have in the whole 14months that I have been playing EQ.

I would assume though for alot of people that are powergamers, a halfling
druid would be a good decision, for they do level faster than the others.
That may be reasoning for what you saw, only a guess though. I will admit
I have seen some d00ds as well, but I am sure that their time on FV will
be short lived.
