I have to disagree that instill doubt is useless. If you can fear kite, you
can significantly reduce the amount of damage you do. I've partnered with a
druid who snares the mob, and then if I can get one or two successful ID's
per fight, it works out great. Unfortunately it does take FOREVER to raise
the skill, and I've neglected it. I know if I expect to solo any more, I
need to fear kite. Stuff just hits too hard.
