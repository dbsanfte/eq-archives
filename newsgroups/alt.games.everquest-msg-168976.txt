    See Bergh's experiment, posted above. Had a monk pull a mob the cleric
was not KOS to, get beat on a bit, then cleric used Divine Arbitration and
the monk feigned afterwards. Mob still not KOS to the cleric, wanders away.
Zero aggro. None. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Perhaps your rogue friend would like to
replicate that experiment, and then get back to us on how much aggro Divine
Arbitration is? ;-)
