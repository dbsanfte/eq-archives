Just out of curiousity, what method do you employ to kill him?  We had our 
first attempt at the perma-rooted bastard on Thursday, and employed the 
split-force method.  We had a small force keep the right wall cleared, and 
positioned ourselves so that any knockback would send us into the right 
wall.  It worked well, though we didn't kill him.  We got much closer than 
we expected, and then spent a day or so discussing better ways to keep the 
right wall clear.
Of course then one of our officers watched our servers UberGuild kill him, 
and they just ran in directly and didn't worry about any of his guards.  
I'm about 90% sure I know how they positioned themselves, but I don't know 
how exact you have to be for this.  
So, do you guys clear a wall and ensure that if you do get knocked back 
that you go there, or do you just employ a frontal assault?  I'm sure 
he'll fall next time we try, I'm just hoping it doesn't take three waves.
