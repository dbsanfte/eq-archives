Heh, the union pamphlet lies!  There's no way you can be a lazy chanter 
(in a group) and be even marginally effective.  On a raid (where mana 
draining doesn't play a role), sure.  Buff everyone, then maybe nuke if 
you feel like it, unless you're the only enchanter, then you'll have to 
tash too, and cripple if the shammies are being lazy.

Loud and overbearing?  Yes, those are required, usually, in pickup groups.  
Usually after the eleventy-seventh mezz has been broken.

Self-centered is not allowed.  Enchanters are one of the top classes for 
being put in the position of having to take one for the team.  If you're 
too self-centered for that... please.  This is not the class you are 
looking for.  Move along.
