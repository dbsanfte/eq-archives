Actually, we ARE "farming" for something: XP. when someone else comes
along and slows our xp gain by KSing us, then it's a problem.

Also, Cryptic and NCSoft may make the "official" rules, the "social"
rules of the game are set up by the players. The majority of players
find KSing to be rude (although, not all find it rude ENOUGH to make a
big deal out of it). You'd be hard pressed to find many players at all
that don't find following someone around and constantly KSing them to
be a REAL problem. And this, by the way, is something Cryptic DOES
agree on and WILL discipline over. Contrary to what someone else
mentioned, whether or not the KSer is too high to get xp doesn't
matter. Repeated, persistent KSing is harassment, is griefing, and
*IS* against the rules.
