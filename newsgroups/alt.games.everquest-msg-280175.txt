Well, presuming someone responds to him/her, which you did, and 
presuming that someone copies his/her content, which you also did I 
doubt 'fear of having it archived' was the motivation or he'd/she'd be 
much better off not posting at all.

So...  perhaps he's/she's counting on someone to reply, copy the content 
and archive it for him/her, and he/she feels he's/she's just doing 
his/her part to try and reduce the cost of the "internet" by reducing 
redundancy.

;)

PS Damn we need a gender neutral 3rd person pronoun in this stupid 
language. Talk about redundancy.
