I logged on my Iksar BL to play for a little bit tonight in Lake of
Ill Omen; this was about 6:15 p.m. Pacific Time, so it would be
between 6:15-9:15 p.m. in the United States.  Just out of curiosity I
did a /who to see how many people were in the zone; and it turns out I
was the only one!  I was only on for about an hour and I think the
highest number of people in the zone during that time was maybe about
eight players!

I remember when on a weekday evening in the U.S. there would be an
average of about 70-75 people in LOIO, and sometimes more than 100
people, especially on the weekends.  I know that Paludal Caverns is
really popular because of the obscene amount of experience one gets
there, but I hadn't realized how popular; now it seems like LOIO is a
ghost town these days. (of course there's also the fact that PC is
easier to get to than LOIO, at least for non-Iksars)

For the record, I have been to PC exactly one time, and that was just
to figure out how to get there if I ever did decide to want to play
there, and I only stuck my head in there for a minute and left.  I
finally decided I wasn't really interesting in playing there; I'm
rather weird in that I like to avoid the spots that are really
popular, so I'm actually determined to deliberately stay away from PC,
even if it does give lots of experience.  (plus I prefer to solo since
my playing time is limited, and I find my BL to be an excellent
soloer, so it's no big deal to me if there are only a couple of people
in the zone).

I chatted with the few people in the zone and asked if PC was now like
the LOIO of the past, when it was often referred to as Lake of Ill
Manners because of all the idiots KSing, training, etc., and they said
pretty much, yeah, so I guess I'm not missing much! :-)

Anyway, sorry for rambling but I just thought it was interesting.
