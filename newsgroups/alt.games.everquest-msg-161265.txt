I'll disagree (since we're just arsing around anyway) and put druid at
easier than rogue, if only for the fact that Fay is a pansy compared to
the pulls and fight required for the general. Since the OP included
"annoying" and "long", I'll still put cleric harder than both because of
the number of camps for insanely rare random spawns involved, (Lord
Bubblebutt in Lake Rath, and that idiot in Sol A) and the current
nerftastic drop rate for the shards in skyfire.

Haven't done a lick of the epic for any of our few beastlords yet, so
I've no clue how easy/tough that one is.
