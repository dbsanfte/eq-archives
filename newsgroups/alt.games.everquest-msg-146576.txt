I find it hard to beleive someone can not realize that a pack of mobs
being quad-kited (Assuming quad kiting from the statement "one of my
bunch was loose") are already enganged. I mean, they don't exactly
normally path all together in a nice, neat little pack like that...

Of course, it is entirely possible that he DID pass the Beastlord
while he was medding, the rager broke off on him, and he decided to
fight it down. The Beastie would have been well within his rights,
IMO.
