The most fun I ever had in a chess tournament was when I entered the
"open" section of a tournament instead of the "under 1800" section (I
was rated about 1600).

I had no realistic chance of a winning a game in that tournament.  In
6 games, I managed one draw, and was pretty lucky to get that.

Nevertheless, I played the best chess I've ever played in that
tournament...and every game seemed more meaningful than the usual
games in the class sections, because of the challenge.
