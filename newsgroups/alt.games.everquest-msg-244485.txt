Whenever a patch is put on it seems there are always a few servers that remain 
up.  How can I play on those servers?  For instance in todays message it says 
all servers are down except for Kael Drakkal and Sebelis.  If I can I'd like 
to create characters on those servers so I can play during patch times.  
Problem is that when I launch the game and I put my password in it never 
connects to the server selection screen.
