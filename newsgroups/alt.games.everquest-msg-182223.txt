Oh, I understand and agree perfectly.

But I normally cast CH at 40 to land between 20 and 30, and I *announce* it.
Or sometimes cast at 60 for an unslowed MOB; different situations call for
different strategies. (I've seen non-raid MOBs requiring a cast at 80...)

I *love* it when the tank gets below 20% or so and somebody throws a patch
heal. If the tank's HP drop below 10% or so, I'm not doing my job right.
The tanks joke when their HP drop below 10%, but I don't like it any more
than they do.

Any cleric that resents patch healing needs a reality check.

It's when they're trying to second-guess me that drives me insane...
they're blowing mana for no good reason. Result is that they're LOM and
can't patch heal when it's *needed*.
