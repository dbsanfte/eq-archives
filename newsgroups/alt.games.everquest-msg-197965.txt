Replying to Graeme's because yours never showed, Meerina.

I farmed the frog bloods in the Swamp at the Frog city - I was bored and 
had an hour or so to waste.  I got the Sarnak bloods waiting for the 
Chancelor to pop ( getting everyone I can keyed for HS ). I only have 1 Tae 
Ew so far, but can get more when time warrants it.

Thanks for the info on the Iksars I mentioned.  I haven't spent much time 
in Dulak, but I'll put the word out for people to save the blood.

I can't decide what item to have my smith friend make with the bloods.  My 
warrior will be wearing full brellium whenever I give him the stuff to make 
it and my rogue is basically just leveling up for Chardok.  The Chain armor 
would be nice but the Rogue is decked out nicely now with borrowed stuff 
and the 14damage piercer is sweet, but it has a required level way above 
the level I plan on getting him to.
