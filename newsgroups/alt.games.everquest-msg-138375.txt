My server (Cazic) has a bazaar channel.  As far as I know there's no way 
to list channels.  Perhaps someone has set up a web site listing them?

On Cazic I wondered if there was a channel to request and offer ports 
for plat.  There has never been anyone in the taxi channel when I 
checked, and the port channel has been password protected for months.  I 
finally guessed the password.  It's port:plz of course.  But no one was 
in it when I checked.  Very frustrating.

Do other servers have a channel for this?
