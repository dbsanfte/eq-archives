Two words? <Two> words? Guess all that sun and exercise isn't all it's
cracked up to be...

I always wondered about the western peculiarity of actually seeking sunlight
and "the hard life" of exercise and physical exertion. I suspect it may come
from being a few steps behind on the evolutionary scale. Asians for example
(I find Asian girls attractive hence my interest and knowledge) have long
since broken the "caveman" mindset and realise that life has changed
somewhat in the last few hundred thousand years.

 A desirable partner to them is not just the muscled (from menial labour)
and tanned (from <outdoors> menial labour) but more likely to be the pale
(from indoor and/or supervisory roles) and overweight (from being successful
and enjoying the good life) although not too much as that will cause health
problems (A dead husband does not support a family very well).

Our entertainment?

Yes - and this is exactly how much much it hurts me:

I have many insecurities but my physical appearance is not one of them. It
suits my lifestyle perfectly.....
