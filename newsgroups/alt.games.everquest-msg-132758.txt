Nowadays, the scam only works if someone puts up two items more than
they can fit in their normal inventory (For instance, having full
bags/only space in tiny bags and then putting mainhand and offhand
weapons in a trade window). When the trade is canceled, the first
weapon is put on the cursor, and the second weapon drops to the
ground, with a message that you didn't have space for that and it has
dropped.
Confirmed dropping/no dropping at all can't override the limits of
inventory space.
