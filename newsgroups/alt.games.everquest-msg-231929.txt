Finally reached Sony on the phone and they said my account is a Ubisoft 
account.  I don't know how this could be.  I live in the US and my credit card 
is from a US company.  I play on the Innorruuk server and never played on a 
European server.  Anyone else have this problem and how do I go about getting 
my account switched to Sony in the US?
