No official policy.

Unreasonable to 'ask'? No. Unreasonable to 'expect'? Yes.

Many people are nice enough to move on or will share a spawn graciously, 
even when they are PLing or farming... but not all of them.

"Sod off," I guess.

Or I suppose you could stick it to them, and log on a hi-level main or 
summon your guild of 65ths...and launch a raid in Kurns tower until 
there is *nothing* in Kurn's tower left to power-level off of, and then 
keep it like that until they leave... this won't take long.

PLers are there for fast XP, its not worth their time to compete for 
mobs. If an opposing force shows up to share the spawns that *can* out 
pull, out damage, and even stave off kill-steal attempts by the PL team, 
then they've got no percentage in sticking around.

> Would a player have any recourse?

Official recourse. None. Unofficial recourse... see above.
