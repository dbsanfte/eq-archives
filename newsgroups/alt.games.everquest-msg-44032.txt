They have done some of this already, more would probably help.  For
Kurns, I was binding my monk buddy over outside Kaesora, really
not bad at all.  Lake of Ill Omen, though, she's stuck with the death
run thru Firiona Vie, since a monk can't invis to get out of Cabalis.  Making
people cross high level high danger zones to get to decent hunting grounds
their level is just nuts.  Course LOIO is hardly unpopular despite this, so
it certainly isn't the only problem.

At higher levels, Verant wants to encourage you to rely on a cleric/paladin
to res you back to your body, preferably the cleric, who can bind nearby.
Up till 29, though, this isn't an option, so low level zones should all have
convenient bind points nearby, while over 39 you are busy relying on
the res to get you exp back, so a nearby bind point isn't going to interfere
with your wanting a cleric either.
