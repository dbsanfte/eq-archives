Hi.

Everquest for most of us die-hard believers is a dead world, the fun
went out of the game a very long time ago.

The Everquest project wants to rebuild that origional feeling we all
had when playing the game, the development team is going out of their
way to recreate the origional game for people whom never got a chance
to experience everquest at it's finest.

If you miss playing the game as it once was before the Kunark
expansion to really see what true everquest is all about then come and
join us at

http://www.projecteq.org/

Hope to see you there.
