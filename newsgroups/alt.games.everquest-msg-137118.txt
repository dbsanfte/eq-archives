And mutter some choice words about the cleric. Single target aego me
and die... I try to be good about aego if I have c2 or kei, but last
night, I had aego on me from the night before and c2 ran out before a
new enchanter arrived at the raid. The loss of that extra mana regen
was very noticeable, and it wasn't long before I went ahead and
clicked aego off anyway.

Sev gave me mask of the hunter the other night. Yay, extra mana for
velium hound hunting!

Mask of the stalker is one of three spells on my want list, along with
NR and moonfire.
