Well hopefully they just have the damage stacking and not any
of the secondary effects. Maybe they could implement a 'law
of diminishing returns' for each successive spell cast.

For instance if a spell lowered a mobs AC by 20 points
the second dot applied could lower the AC by 10 more points
and the 3rd application lowering it another 5 points, etc.

But the damage should always stack. After all 5 monks can all
attack the same mob at the same time and 5 wizards can all nuke a
mob at the same time so why shouldn't 5 necros be able to cast the same
5 Dots on a mob?
