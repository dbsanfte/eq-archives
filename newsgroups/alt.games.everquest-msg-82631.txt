   I did read that, CM.  And what you do in your family
is certainly your business.  I would never presume to
remark on the relationships you have with those you hold
dear.  But I am not a member of your family.  Neither,
I assume, is Dark Tyger.  In the context of your family,
the word "Nazi" may very well be a term of affection.  To
most of the rest of the world, it brings to mind WWII, and
the torturous death of over 6 million victims who where
starved, or worse, simply because of racial hate.

   You may well be.  But in this particular case, you 
hiding it well.  Calling someone a "Nazi" in usenet is
an ad hominid attack, regardless of how you try change
its meaning by giving your familial context of the word.
    Calling someone a "Nazi", regardless of the context
you try to impose on it, is no more sophisticated, and
a good deal more mean spirited, than calling them a
"booger-head".  Hence Goodwin's Law, which now more than
ever I believe should not bet set aside.
