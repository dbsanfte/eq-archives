Several.... concerns I have with that:

1)  As some agency outside the family takes apon itself part of the
responsiblity of raising a child, the parents will slowly relinquish control
over that area.  In other words, we're training parents to be ineffective,
and then using that ineffecitveness to justify additional government
involvement.  Kinda like the mechanic who fixes one problem with your car,
then breaks something else, so you keep coming back to him, thankful that he
can keep your "troublesome" car running.

2)  The TV program is probably the most innocent of those, as you can remove
it from the batch if you don't like what you see, so I'd rather
contraversial things like this remain on PBS, than migrate to the classroom.

3)  No part of the government has the right or responsiblity to rear my
child.  That's clearly govenrment overstepping it's bounds, but always for
the "highest of reasons."

4)  My train of thought derailed, so I guess I'm done here.
