I've not done the math, but I'm pretty sure it isn't much more (if so) 
than a minute.

It's never been a problem for me. When I'm interrupted, I am able to hit 
my melee attacks, specials (based on hotkeys) and cast spells just fine, 
so it is probably limited to affecting other macros until it runs its 
course. 

The only thing I try to keep an eye on is wasting bandages. If I get too 
close to 70% and know I still have another bind or two queued up, I just 
hit ESC to untarget myself, and no additional bandages are wasted, or 
I'll just switch targets to a nearby groupmate to help top them off. This 
works if I target a mob to fight as well, as rather than triggering the 
bind wound ability, it gives me the "You must target a player character 
to bandage" message.
