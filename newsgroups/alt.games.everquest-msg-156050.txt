Monks got nerfed cause they needed it.

Most people agree on this.

With that damage output they shouldn't be better at avoiding damage than a
warrior like they used to.

Warrior had more HP but that don't matter much in experience groups.

There used to be very little sense in taking a warrior over a monk in those
circumstances.

After the patch monks are still a great class.

Before the patch an unequipped monk at 49 could outtank a well equipped
ranger at 55, that's crazy.
