I hate to med and I hate to med a lot.  I quit EQ a while back when I got tired
of staring at my spell book.  I've recently come back and can't put into words
how much more fun I'm having now with the new zones and the availablility of C3
and KEI.  I think KEI has made the game everything I always hoped it would be
for me and I'm really enjoying myself again.  I have recently learned that some
items will also increase my mana regen rate and that if I get items with
Flowing Thought that I will get the increased regen.  My question is that since
I'm pretty certain that if this is true that these must be valuable items and
must be very expensive and or difficult to come by.  Is it possible that a poor
level 41 wizzie can hope to start looking for some stuff with Flowing Thought
or should I just forget about it and try to keep leveling?
