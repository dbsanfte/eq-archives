    Split it however you want. When I did mine, I had 2 in Channeling, 2 in
Healing Gift, 2 in Healing Adept, 2 in Mental Clarity, 2+4 in Spell Casting
Mastery, and 2 in Reinforcement. Just so I could see how each one impacted
my play.

    I'm not sure Tarre would even notice the extra points in Mental Clarity,
what with Lich+ level mana regen. I'd look into Spell Casting Mastery (IF
they fix it) and Natural Durability, with SCM being the one I'd max first.
12% mana savings on all spells cast is huge (IF they fix it). Do any of the
nice Class skills have Archetype prerequisites for necromancers?

    Lifeburn is a really quirky ability, which frequently leads to the death
of the necromancer using it. Read up on it on one of the necro class sites
first - the necromancers we have with it are ambivalent about how useful it
is.
