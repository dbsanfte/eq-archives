slaughters are by far the easiest.

kill xx

as opposed to:
kill xx AND find <named> AND kill <hard hitting name>
kill xx AND find <npc> AND clear path to zone out while keeping <npc> alive
kill xx where xx = 5 * amount of collects

For any other type you usually need to kill 1.5 to 2 times as many as in a
kill xx adventure. plus chance to fail because you took a wrong turn.
collects are usually even worse because you need to wipe every dead and
usually have to retrace your steps to see if you missed anything. Without
good maps the other 3 types are just too hard compared to the kill xx.
