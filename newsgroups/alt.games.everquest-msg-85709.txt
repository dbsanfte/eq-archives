New drop, nice dam/del + it's H2H not 1HB, Stats and a Sv bonus and weighs
less than 1 "stone" (just) plus a 50dd proc.
Shame it's lore.
OK, it says common drop but haven't seen too many in EC so I'd guess 10k (if
you're selling ask for 15k just to test water)
If this is as common as the Centi weapons then the price will come tumbling
down real quick (it'll fall anyway, it's just a matter of how fast)  and you
might as well half my PC...any idea when it procs?

On the plus side, even if it is common I have not seen many people hunting
that fort, at least on BB. Most in TM will use the small outpost near the KC
entrance to pull from.
