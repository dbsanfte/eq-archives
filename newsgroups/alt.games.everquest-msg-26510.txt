> How do you bound your left and right arrow keys to use sense heading?

I'm not a tech writer, so this may be difficult to understand,
although I hope not.   I may also use some wrong terminology,
but if you're familiar with the game, I imagine you can see if
I did and translate if necessary.

----

First, create a hotkey for it.   Pull up the abilities menu, click
and hold on the one you want, and drag the button (when it
becomes one, takes a second or two) to the hotkey bank and
put it in one of the boxes there.   (You can also create a macro
and put it in your hotkey bank, of course, but I don't believe
you can use abilities in macros.)

Then go into the options menu, select keyboard, and page
through until you see the option for user keys.  These are
keystrokes used to execute the hotkey bank buttons.  (I
believe they're set by default to ALT-1, etc, but I'd have
to look to be sure.)

Find the user key for the hotkey where you placed your
Sense Heading button, and click in the options menu to
select that one.   Then, you just hit a key that you want
to define to execute that hotkey, for instance, the right
arrow key.

That makes the right arrow key bound to two actions:  first,
it turns your character to the right.   Second, it executes
whatever is in that slot in your hotkey bank.    If you put
Sense Heading there, it will try to do a Sense Heading
whenever you turn to the right.

BTW, these settings are used for ALL your characters
and ALL your hotkey banks.   If you have Sense Heading
in the bottom left hotkey bank on one character, and
Pickpocket in the bottom left hotkey bank on another
character, they'll both start working when you bind a key
to that position.   This can lead to some surprises if you
don't pay attention....

---

For my cleric, I've got Sense Heading bound to the left arrow
key and a /loc macro button bound to the right arrow key on
most of the banks.   (You have 10 possible hotkey banks.)  So,
as I move around, I automatically get both a direction and the
current location.   For my ranger, he has Sense Heading and
Forage in those slots for most banks, and /loc in his "traveling"
bank so I know where I'm at all the time.   My wife has the same
setup for her druid, but uses Sense Heading and a "/pet follow me"
macro for her mage in one bank, so she always knows the pet is
close when traveling with a pet.   In her "fighting" bank, she put
a "/pet report health" button there, so all she has to do to monitor
its health is hit an arrow key while sitting.   That frees up the six
visible slots in Spellbook mode for other things:   an /assist macro,
a /pet back off macro, a /pet attack macro, a macro which heals
her pet, etc.

I went through the tedium of training Sense Heading up to decent
levels on both my cleric and my warrior by sitting and clicking that
stupid button.   My ranger - new character - got his sense heading
and forage max'd without me even thinking about it as he just ran
around killing bats in Qeynos Hills.
