I just hang around a newbie zone, normally Black Burrow or Nektolus but
sometimes Crushbone and watch for suitable recipient...Trouble is I'm a real
git so not only do you need to be not wielding Lammys, begging for equipment
but I'll also not give anything if you have a dumb name as well. So, I don't
end up giving much away...those that do receive (I never give plat) get a
fair amount tho :ï¿½)
