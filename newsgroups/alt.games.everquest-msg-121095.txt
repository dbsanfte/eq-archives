I have the guilded the chimp so he occasionally get called in to summon
corpses and for the first time find myself being ported around in groups. I
have noticed that the 768mb of PC133 Ram and Geforce 3 Ti 64mb system causes
him to be the group speed demon on the zoning. First few times it happened
it scared the willies out of me, popping alone into an previously unknown
zone and waiting.... waiting.... waiting..... <starts to worry> ....*pop*
<phwew> ....waiting *pop* *pop*  ....waiting *pop* *pop*.
