What he said=)

I love exploring new zones when i get the chance to...for a long time 
one of my empty slots had different characters rolled up in it to use to 
explore places my mains were KOS. i took a baby halfling rogue all over 
norrath and much of luclin =) I have had a blast hunting in all sorts of 
different zones, and to me half the fun is finding great places to hunt 
that helped my factions or at least didnt give me hits=) Now if I could 
only get kael to amiable without thrashing my coldain and veeshan factions.
