I have a 51 mage, and I'd give up any chance at CoTH (which
is nerfed into oblivion in many zones - for very good reason)
for the following -

1.  Pet Hold as an innate ability for all pet classes at 50
2.  On attacking a target, if the pet has LOS on it, it ignores
    all the pathing nodes in a zone and beelines for it.
3.  On returning to it's Guard here spot, or master, if it has
    LOS if makes a beeline for that spot.
4.  Get rid of the recently confirmed 4 pet limit for attacking
    a single mob.
5.  Get rid of the pet EXP penalty in a group (not solo).

Note that the first 3 are for all pet classes, and 2&3 simply
go to fixing problems with the pathing.

4 was long rumored to be gone, but was recently confirmed to be
in game, and the pet EXP taking in a group is worse than many
had believed (Instead of the pet having to do 51% of the total
damage to take a share of the xp (as was previously though) it
just has to outdamage each of the PC's individual damage.  This
negates many alternate grouping combinations, especially ones
where pets contribute the majority of the damage.)

All of these are simply to fix the situations where pets are
strongly discouraged.  Interestingly enough, in the same response
where he confirmed 4 and 5, Alan stated that they didn't want
situations where magicians would rather not use their pets.

The irony almost choked me.
