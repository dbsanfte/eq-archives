There's nothing wrong with this.  If you don't like it, go somewhere 
else, or try a game with more instancing or something; the MM in MMOG 
means you have to deal with the fact that you don't get zones to yourself.

Instead of "complaining" you might have made your suggestion despite him 
not asking first; assuming there was room you or he might have been able 
to change your locations a bit to reduce the chance of conflict.

Nope, its not a violation of the rules.  It -might- be a violation of 
standard practices of the EQ community, but honestly in this case it 
doesn't sound like it.  You seem to have been in the wrong up to this point.

Deliberately training you -is- a violation both of SOE policy and 
community policy.  Proving this is what was going on (if it even was; 
mobs can spill from kites fairly easily, which is why your initial idea 
of suggesting some seperation was a good one for both parties) is 
difficult, though, without a witness or the guy actually saying thats 
what he's doing.


The OOC stuff on the other hand, is just talk, unless you think he was 
threatening to stalk you and deliberately prevent you leveling.  This 
would be pretty hard to accomplish, but trying it, and even threatening 
to do it, -would- be another violation.  If, on the other hand, he was 
simply stating his opinion that someone as inept as you would never 
manage to level up that far, then thats just talk.

Four years ago, you could reliably get a GM to show up and observe 
behavior, and you -might- get some results.  After that the odds 
gradually dropped, but a big shift came after the Legends server went 
in, at that point the odds of anyone not on that server getting timely 
GM attention dropped dramatically.  After all, poor GM service on the 
regular servers might drive you to pay more per month plus a moving 
fee... its not in SOE's best interest to give good CS elsewhere anymore!

Red to 60 means level 62 or higher, not 65 or higher.

That would be training.  Tit for tat I suppose, but you'd lose all basis 
for moral superiority.  No surprise if you started talking about it that 
some people left, because many people would rather not train someone 
even if he deserves it.

Many people play on PvP servers for just that reason.  But if you think 
someone is annoying because he wants to play near you, think how 
annoying it would be for him to wait till you are low on hp and mana and 
engaged with several difficult mobs, then suddenly attack out of 
nowhere.  Rarely is a PvP battle a fair fight, and people who -like- 
messing with other people make up a disproportionate fraction of the PvP 
server crowd.

Thats some AI on that virus, to know when to LD him... sometimes, 
though, I've suspected SOE of writing one that tells my machine to LD 
whenever I get a really good group ready to go somewhere fun.
