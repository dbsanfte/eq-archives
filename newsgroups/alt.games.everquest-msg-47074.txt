Personally I have a hard time believing you could persuade 24 people
(sufficiently intelligent and motivated people to be able to learn to fly
planes etc) to kill themselves just because "god wants you to, k?". I go
along with the 'pissed off' angle myself but I guess we'll just have to
differ.

That's a nice line of propaganda there. I'm sure it was a factor given the
hardline muslim world's treatment of women in general, but don't you think
the blatantly uneven 'policing' of UN resolutions by the west in general and
the US in particular might be a bigger factor? Ya know, the way we bomb and
sanction arab countries that break resolutions and yet allow Israel to
flaunt far more significant ones while at the same time oppressing arabs?
That would be my take on it. . .

Hrm well if you dig back into the roots of the Northern Ireland 'troubles'
I'd say invading the country in the first place was a pretty obvious
'flexing'.

I'll give you religious zealots but I don't buy the psychotic line. . .

Pretty simplistic dismissal of all terrorist/freedom fighter motivation. . .

The massacre of 6000+ innocent civilians is never justifiable. . .

Sorry, but it _is_ understandable. Anyone telling you this was the random
act of a bunch of madmen and IN NO WAY related to the past or current
actions of the US and allies and their pursuit of foreign policy goals is
lying to you. IMHO of course.
