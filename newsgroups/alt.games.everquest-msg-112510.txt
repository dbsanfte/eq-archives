And the point is?  That there is a three month window for something that's
just been announced to release over a year from now?  That just doesn't
bother me too much.  Of course, you could make it really interesting by
pointing out that 01Jan03 is also "Winter 2003."  Of course, Verant cleared
that up by stating "4th Quarter."
