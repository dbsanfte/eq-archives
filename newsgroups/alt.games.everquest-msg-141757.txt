255 (decimal) = FF (hex) = 11111111 (binary)

this is the largest number you can get with an 8-bit 'byte' (count the
number of 1's in the binary) so it's not very likely there will ever be a
way to get stats over 255, because they'd have to re-write massive sections
of code to do it, adding another byte to each stat, to raise the cap to
65,535 :o)
