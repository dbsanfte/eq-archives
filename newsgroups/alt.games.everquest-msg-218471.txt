And somehow that makes it ok?

But China was in hot water with the UN, which you seem to care about.

Troops will fight and die as they always have.  Doesn't make it
glorious or good, just a reality.  And I personally believe Iraq had
the weapons, even though you can't be convinced.  And assuming they
didn't, the man still needed to be taken out of power if not taken out
completely.  As for the UN being mad, well, we are the UN.  I would
love to see how long it lasted without the US fronting everything:
troops, money, etc.  As for recession, there are no timeouts for
recession when it comes to bad people.  I don't think George W. Bush
Jr. is the greatest president we've ever had, but we've certainly had
worse, like the one just before him.
