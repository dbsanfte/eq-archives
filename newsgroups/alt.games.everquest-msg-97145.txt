Just so you know...  I am one person who is looking at the patch with some
mixed feelings.

I do run 7 other alts that will benefit from some of these changes, a
Cleric, for one...  For Rezes...  an Enchanter, Ranger, Beastlord as well as
my Cleric to gain benefits of medding without a friggin book...

I do have concerns about the 1-10 CR bit.  It should be 1-5 CR, not 1-10.
As for 1-10 XP boost...  Sorry... I also have problems with it too.  One of
the things I find a problem with fast leveling players...  Is the lack of
understanding of their character and their abilities.  While getting higher
is great, the understanding of their character is lacking when people are at
these formation levels.  In the progress of learning how to play my Druid...
I learned upfront I need to stop trying to melee, and focus more on trying
to kite, and root and dot...  More so when I hit my twenties.

When I played my first cleric, I was berated for not knowing my character,
and I had help getting up to the level I was at.

Also...  For new players...  While I admit... EQ is not newbie friendly...
Why encourage Newbies to do stupid things even further?  Playing in CB...  I
have seen people ruin my ability to level my 13th level Enchanter further,
because they keep doing stupid things.  I have now...  Brought my Druid into
the zone a few times just to derail people's stupidity, denying them their
spoils now because they haven't gotten the hint not to try it without proper
support.

From experience...  Too fast will create issues.
