An easy to get pair of magic boots are the Hunting Leather Boots quested in 
Shadeweaver's Thicket.  They aren't great overall but for a new level 6 
player they are pretty handy and best of all, free.

All you need to do is kill the Saurek Hoppers until you have four Saurek 
Hopper Scales and then hand them to Captain Tarief for the boots.  The 
Scales are droppable and can be found on the merchants in the zone almost 
all the time if you have a few gold to spare.

The Saurek Hoppers should be within the abilities of a level 6 warrior if he 
watches out for adds and single pulls them.

The Scales are uncommon but not too bad and the Saureks drop varing quality 
rockhopper hides that can be sold in the Bazaar for up to 50pp each for the 
High Quality ones.
