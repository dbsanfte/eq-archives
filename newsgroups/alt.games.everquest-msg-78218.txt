The sad thing about The Simarillion is, I bought the book on tape version,
the complete unabridged version.  I played it while driving cross country,
got the tapes mixed up, I think somewhere around tape 10 or 11, swapped two
of them.  I didn't notice my mistake until much later.  It seemed a bit
confusing for a moment when I put the wrong tape in, but not for very long.
I had read the book a very long time before.  I don't see myself ever
reading it again, it just did not do much for me.  OTOH, I am rereading The
Hobbit, and Lord of the Rings for the 8th time or so.
