Just today I made it to EK with my Iksar monk (got bound in Arena). You can
imagine how disappointed I was when having killed 4 Carrion Spiders I had looted
nothing! No silks, no halfling meat, nothing! Was I just monumentally unlucky or
did Verant screw up the loot for Carrion Spiders? Anyone else suffer the same
indignity?
