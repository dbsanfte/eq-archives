:> Maybe they need to make something expensive, filling and lightweight,
:> like Elven Waybread, something that would be too pricey for most
:> players, but have a stack weight 0.1 and Monks would be lining up.

: Well theres already Elven Trailmix - hearty meal, weighs 0.5 I believe,
: and a stack costs just over a plat to my Woodelf. Probably too heavy for
: monks though...

  Fishrolls, .1 weight, Hearty Meal, I think I'll take up Baking.

exterior transtemporal mechanics function when you're dealing with
omni-dimensional ripple effects triggered at the end of a continuum
