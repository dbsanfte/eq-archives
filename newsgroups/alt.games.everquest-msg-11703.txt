There was no criteria stated such as soloing or grouping.  Mark simply
professed to compare pure tanking ability (which excludes spells in my
definition of "tanking") between various classes.  The confusion and
dispute began when Barry implied that the Shaman class is a tank.
This is a dispute of semantics.  It would be more accurate to say that
a Shaman may be more powerful than a Warrior (if that's really
so--*shrug*), but the term "tanking" refers to the Warriors method of
fighting, while the Shaman's method of fighting would be called...
would be...  *shrug*  "debuffing, dotting, AND tanking".  Take away
the spells, and you've got your accurate comparison of "tanking".

If the shaman cast no offensive spells such as Slow or other debuffs,
or DOTs, but just pre-fight self buffs...  I'd find this hard to
believe.  Add in the debuffs and dots, and then it would be more
realistic to me that the Shaman would win.  Either way, it's not a
pure tanking test if the Shaman buffs themself up to the "T" before
the fight.  It's simply a duel.
