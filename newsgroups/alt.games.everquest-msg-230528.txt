This is likely to be W32.SwenA@mm.

Microsoft *never* posts patches, updates or anything of the sort to
Usenet.  Neither does it email them.  They are always bogus.  Viruses,
trojans or whatever and usually with spoofed headers.  If you have
doubts check the Microsoft Windows website and do a search on
"security" or similar terms.  Or sub to microsoft.public.security
where this is quite repetitively discussed.  Or use a little common
sense.  If you use Micro$oft products and don't know if you are up to
date on patches use Windows Update to find out; something you should
do on a frequent basis anyway.

Likewise be wary of any messages alledgedly from your ISP claiming to
have lost records or such BS and asking you to email confidential
information to them.  Go to your ISP's website or access Support from
your start page and it's practically certain you'll find they never
ask for information in this way rather than through you entering it at
their site over a secure connection.  If your ISP is so lax as to ask
for confidential info submitted by regular email, you really ought to
change ISPs.  Such messages are usually identity theft type scams
though there is said to be one alledgedly from Dell.com about your
account having expired which contains the W32.HLLW.Torvel.B@mm worm.

The following subject lines usually contain the Win32.Spybot Worm or
the Backdoor.Litmus.203.b Trojan, according to a post in another
group.

Britney Spears Nude is presumably the same as it shows exactly the
same line count/size as Christina Aguilera Nude which must be a
nuisance in the two newsgroups I've spotted which are devoted to
binaries of Britney Spears nude.  :-)
