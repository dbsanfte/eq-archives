Maybe people don't.  But I do.  I have a twink of every class except 
Paladin (because... I just don't see the point) and Enchanter (because 
that's my main).  So at some point, I must have hit most of the 
unpopular ones.  My ranger twink is a wood elf though. :)

On a side note, it's amazing how much I suck at playing a druid.  I 
thought this was supposed to be easy...
