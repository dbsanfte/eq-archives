A good assumption.

Which is swell. But just because you play that way doesn't mean you
should expect others to. 

>I just found it arrogant to refuse a 40 mana buff, when asked politely. 

I find it arrogant that you would criticize people simply because they
don't play the way you think they ought to.

>It appears that I play EQ different from you (and the 6 druids I accuse 
>of being arrogant).

Yes, apparently. I never ask for a free buffs, and I never approach
people directly for buffs. I always offer a specific payment, and I
always do so via /auction.

And, of course, I never condemn an entire demographic just because
they didn't leap at the opportunity to give me a free buff.

>I just think my way makes the game a nicer game. 

It certainly would have made it nicer for you, anyway, which is what
you wanted - to make your trip go faster.
