A quick brown froglock jumped over all good men to come to the
aid of his guild.  Where are you going Molly Jean?  Are there fruit
loops in your underwear?  I was unaware catching flies with
lemonade puts meat loaf in your tea.  Are there authors in the
jelly?  Does Mrs. Brown know she's queen Victoria, and was her
lovely daughter named Elizabeth?  What a set on Herman if she was.
Does anyone run spell checkers anymore, and if they do what is
there purpose when a porpoise has a purported purview of a yard
of ale?

I'm sure I missed a few there, but I did my best without using a
spellchecker or grammar checker.
