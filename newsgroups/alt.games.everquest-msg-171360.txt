Hmm, sorry, but thats the opposite of my experiance-i've had 2 nvidia
cards over the years-both did'nt work well, lots of trouble with
drivers-got rid of a g4,4200 on this system cause it was semi-broke or
somthing-never would work right-the radion worked perfectly for 3
weeks-then the trouble-anyway-thanks for taking the time-Ironeyes
