True some of these are about making the game easier and some are about
making the game require some more forethought.

To provide incentives for players to become friendly with certain
NPC's who are now only targets. For example Gnolls. Basically this
transforms all of these NPC races, Gnolls. Orcs, Kobalds, Frogloks,
Lizards, Aviaks, Centaurs, Ottermen, etc into smaller versions of the
Giant and Dragon factions in Vellious. One of the few good things
Vellious did was add factions where you make a certain choice then
lose some benefits for doing so and gain others. Unfortunately they
wimped out by again making a "correct" path to follow instead of
allowing a real choice. Imagine the same conflict in South karana on a
lesser scale between the Aviaks and Centaurs. With quests too like the
coldain shawl quest.

This ties into the above in terms of giving players a reason to want
to be friendly with certain factions.

As long as items do not degrade the economy will continue to devalue
plat and items. Items cannot be returned to their original place
without wear and tear but money can be given value, by giving the same
costs of existence that would exist in a real economy. This keeps plat
valuable, reduces twinking, spurs people to use any means of getting
wealth, etc.

Because it is unreasonable that I can carry 80 loafs of bread in my
backpack. Food should be less numerous, be consumed less often, cost
more and be non stackable. it also provides an incentive to those
classes who have summoning spells and to those who are involved in the
baking skill. Baked items would weigh less and provide a higher
nutrition per weight value.

Depends on the fee.

They don't need to all they need to do is provide an out when I get a

Takes too long. It takes the equivalent of three eq days before

Having a food vendor on every corner is unrealistic.  If you are going

need.

Exactly. You could if you chose kill a vendor. You could kill a
banker.  But doing so would give you quadrupedal faction hits and
that's not just to them personally its to every NPC of their race,
their class and their religions. You wack the Dwarf guards too often
and the gnome guards will kill you on sight for killing fellow
followers of Brell.

Yes but its not instant.

The difference is they would all start as Threaten now. You would
still have the same options to increase factions but you would also
know that if you got on the equivalent of the ten most wanted list
there would be no turning back.

I guess following the storyline and history of the world seems like
Roleplaying to me and those who do so should be rewarded and those who
go against the spirit of the history should be penalized for it. This
isn;t anything new its the same in real life. You have the option to
go against your families religious values but there will be a cost.
In game the cost of a Tunare and bertoxullus worshiper grouping would
be exp unless both have previously worked their factions to be neutral
to each other.

True, I do think that what it does is remove camping quite a bit, and
in an easier way then the route DAoC has taken.

This is again just something that provides more options to players. I
am always in favor of giving options to players where I can. This
increases the palmers ability to customize themselves to the game and
it provides a money sink.

I think they mean the "/em hey stop attacking my kills asshole" emotes
not the general purpose ones.  using the player built emotes is an
easy way to negate the language barrier.

What would you do if someone you never met came up to you and started
throwing questions at you such as where you work etc. Most people want
some control over how much others know about us. This inherently
protects the palmers privacy somewhat and also increases the need for
player to player interaction.  Once you have known someone for a while
you have no qualms about telling them about your work etc.

A who command is necessary in a game like EQ, and since the world has
magic it can be assumed to be possible, that being said it would still
be limited to those who are your friends or someone you would likely
talk to anyway because they are your race class or ally.

No it would not.  In beta it was entirely possible to swim thru zone
lines as you run thru them now. That is all this change would allow. 
The option to not wait for a boat but to swim is thus given but to
counterbalance it the increased stamina drain means this would mostly
be used by people who had Just missed the boat.
