    haha maybe i should just do it back to you, but I'm not leaving this one
alone.

    If fear fucks up that badly how many times do you think we'll cast it?
27? Ok, good now assume it isn't me but someone you believe to be sane. 2?
Much closer!

    Fear Kiting is Kool and a legitimate tactic. The more dangerous to the
person kiting, the more fun it is, generally. PoJ sounded to me like a place
where (leaving myself open to the ignorance train of attack, fire away if
you like I don't see the point tho - plz note i do not at any point claim
knowledge of the plane of justice) fear kiting had huge rewards and probably
huge risks. That said, I hate all exploits and refuse to use them (like I'm
sure most ppl do) and am dissapointed to hear that much of the exp being
hauled out of there in this manner was through exploiting a pathing bug.

    If fear kiting isn't viable in PoJ without the exploit im doubly
dissapointed and hope there will be some cool places further up the scale
from early 50's zones to try it :) Not to mention any other zany and
not-boring tactics that might work.

    PS I love the tie you should wear it and not be ashamed.
