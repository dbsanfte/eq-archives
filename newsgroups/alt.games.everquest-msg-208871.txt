    The problem would be proving it. "Yeah, Mr. GM, I put.... 200 BILLION
plat in the shared slot, yeah, that's it. That's the ticket. My alt needed
it for his date with Morgan Fairchild." You'd get a lot of people claiming
they lost plat if any bugs came to light, and unless there was a way to
track who actually put how much in the shared slot (which I doubt) the GM's
would be using their judgement on each case.

    But I will give them credit for this: every time EQ has implemented new
features involving trading, they've been pretty damned secure and bug-free.
I think they, more than any prior MMORPG I've seen, understand how important
that is to a game. So if anyone is going to get it right the first time,
they will.
