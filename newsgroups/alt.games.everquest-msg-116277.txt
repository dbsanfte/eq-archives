*grin*

I grew up in Blackburrow in 1999 and it was exactly like that then.
The zone in from Qeynos Hills could expect a Gnoll train (usually with
some of the tougher ones from downstairs helpfully mixed in) which
would mince anyone under level 10 in double quick time.

Thinking about it 'back then' the game was exciting, shiny and new so
taking a "dirtnap" every 45 minutes or so didn't seem such a big deal.
No one was rezzed, you just ran from Surefall or Qeynos if you were
lucky or Halas if you weren't.

Falling down the bastard tree trap and losing all my meagre gear at
level 14 wasn't a huge amount of fun admittedly but it was all crud
looted off mobs we were killing so no great loss in retrospect.

Still, Blackburrow provides the perfect grounding in dungeon basics
(see: Crushbone for smelly Elves) which you will stand you in good
stead later.  Trains, decent pull spots, grouping, zone geography etc.

"Grrr, what is this useless Snare spell for anyway?!"
"I never do any damage with these damn arrows, I'll just sell them"
"SHIT! I FELL!"
"Guys, GUYS, three of us CANNOT get up this ladder at once"
"I'm lost"
"Anyone seen my corpse? It's in the water somewhere"
"Gnoll Brewer up"

Ah... happy days.
