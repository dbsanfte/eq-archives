Some things I might add:

When I quad kite I cast a regen & a damage shield spell. First pass I
run right through them and let myself get hit. They will take some
decent damage from the damage shield. You will regen back the HP's
after another 4 or 5 casts of lightning, at which point I run through
them again. Can usually do this 3 or 4 times during quadding and it
can save you a cast sometimes as the damage they take from the shield
is enough to get them dead when otherwise they might be sitting at  2
or 3 percent.

But the main reason I do this is that it raises your defence skill,
which you'll find will be hugely lagging behind everything because as
a druid you don't get hit a lot.

I don't bother hitting them down with a weapon as your so completely
hopeless with one, by the time you've missed 8 out 10 swings, done 45
damage, you could have sit and medded and done a DD spell for like 600
or whatever level your at.

Cheers,
