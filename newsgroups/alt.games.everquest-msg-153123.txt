>I just killed a giant, how on earth did it not drop a head?????

That danged over-zealous tank with the uber 2HB must have squashed it
beyond recognition. :)

/hijack on

What does everyone think about loot being affected by the method used
to kill a mob? Higher quality piercing or blunt weapons having a
better chance of not damaging a pelt too badly, therefore a better
chance of producing a HQ version? Might give players a better reason
to keep weapon skills up?

Just a thought.
