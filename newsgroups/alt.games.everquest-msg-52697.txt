My opinion Mark was that although by the rules "the first to hit" is the one
who should get the mob but if you were sitting there for 4 hours and someone
tells you that they were going to take it wouldn't you be aggravated that you
just lost 4 hours because someone was being (as I think he thought) a prick to
him.  If I sat on a spawn point for that long and someone logged in and told
me that they were going to jump my spawn when it did I would do the same thing
as he did.   He was in the wrong to ks you but my opinion is you were in the
wrong to take his camp, you bent the rules to suit your situation and he
shattered them out of anger.
