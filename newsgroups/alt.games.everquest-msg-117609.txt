Last time I ran a bard must have been over a year and a half
ago, pretty much stopped around when Velious came out
and breathed new life into my first cleric.  Now I'm on a
new account (new as of a year ago that is) but finally started
another bard.  Thing is my old notes aren't as useful as I'd
like, and hopelessly out of date anyway.

I've poked around a bit, but haven't come up with a good
site yet, any suggestions?

Llyric, 24 bard, Morell Thule (and yes, thats higher level
than old Random, my original bard ever got anyway, so
I'm in untested waters even without the new songs)
