I might also suggest using as much of your HP bar as you safely can, so you 
can take advantage of the new increasing returns HP regen feature. The 
longer you sit, the faster it regens. You end up sitting more if you only 
take it down to 50 or 60% before sitting than if you always take it down to 
25% before sitting. This only applies to HP. This may not be as big a 
factor at the lower levels, but I figure every little bit helps. :)

I agree with the other poster who recommended a mage. You might find that 
class a bit more to your liking. Nukes plus pets.
