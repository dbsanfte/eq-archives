Too bad you aren't on my server, I can't wait to get a cleric friend so we
can go to the new and improved Runnyeye, maybe then I won't get killed so
much...  and even solo with a low blue kill i get a full blue bub, same for
high greens (thanks to the zone exp modifiers).  eesh, i hate the sporeling
hordes that occasionally appear though... and the gobbie casters, they hurt.
