Both major parties.

Ahh... as opposed to a Chinese-owned pathalogical liar like Al Gore?

Good. GFWs need to live in fear.

As opposed to Clinton's appointees who are just this side of
Communists? Damn you have a slanted perspective. Do you smoke a LOT of
reef?

>
>Acceptable?  I THINK NOT.  

I agree. You think not. Not at all. If both parties enter into an
election and both parties agree to the margin of error, then it's
acceptable to both parties. Both knew the rules going in. Then, one
decided that the rules could be broken for an advantage.
Reprehensible.

I'm sure you do.

Sorry. Nope. You bought the lie, and have twisted it around in your
little head so that it rings of gospel to you.

Is THAT why you walk funny? I'd have sworm it was the leprechauns that
have been buggering you all these years. Aren't you a little old to be
believeing in leprechauns?

Fact, You can't honestly dispute his facts. All you can do is try to
make an end run around them, and it's not a very good end-run at that.

Ahh yes, the teckla... Good choice... The peasants... the
proletarians... Must really lend itself to your communist
tendancies...

Teckla is a ficticious "clan" of "people" penned by Steven Brust.
They're the peasant class. just in case anyone was wondering.
