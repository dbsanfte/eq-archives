Bullshit. The powergamers were the biggest *sellers*. Buyers included
a far higher ratio of casual players, who wanted what they could get
without having to earn it. Powergamers tend to have all no drop gear
nowadays, stuff far better than anything that is droppable. The only
ones buying are doing so for their twinks, and even that is barely a
blip.

This is different from buying characters, which has much different
influences and variables.

Want to bet? This strikes to the very core of game integrity. I've
played from the beginning and wouldn't even think twice about quitting
if this happened.

The one game that already made this a part of its premise went bellyup
before ever going live.
