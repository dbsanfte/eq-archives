That's what scares the hell out of me...

We forgot in 1993, 1996, again recently with the Cole bombing, and now an
unfortable (I hope) event. I thinkt here will be a lot of minor retaliations
in the next years over the course of our actions. And some day there will be
larger, more threatening ones... Forgetting is simply burying your head in
the sand until the next one occurs. We can't afford to do that, even though
that is harder to do...

I am psycholigically tough, just not dumb as a brick to not try and find a
plan of defense and action for my family. I won't underestimate the bravado
of the terrorist organization (this isn't just Bin Laden, this is a "Club"
of idiots who flock from conflict to conflict). I do what I do every day,
continue on as normal, but I will do my homework, and protect my family in a
defensive manner. I outlined how I would do that for now in the initial
post. Any conclusions above and beyond those outlines are conjecture and
flames.
