Never, NEVER do this.  Don't argue with a GM.  No matter what.  Arguing is
ITSELF an offense.  Asking very politely what's wrong, if you really don't
understand, is one thing.  Complaining about GM actions or Verant policy
ISN'T acceptable to the GM's.  If they're in a bad mood, just this much
argument, when they're already considering you a problem, is enough for an
insta-suspension.

The 'hard coded' filter is VERY VERY limited.  It ONLY filters out a few
specific obscene words, and such.  It is, by the way, in your client, not at
Verant.  The 'filter' at name creation is that any new character creation is
submitted to an actual GM/Guide's screen for approval.  Unfortunately,
they're busy.  Very busy.  And if the Guide/GM takes no action on it, after
a certain length of time, it's auto approved.  The only 'filter' that really
exists is that names already in use can't be used.  So the GM's can add a
'bad name' to the filterlist of the server, when they catch it, and
essentially, it's just marked 'in use'.

What they SHOULD do is pop up the naming rules whenever you try to create a
character, to force you to READ them.
