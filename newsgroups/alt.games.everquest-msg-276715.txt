I wondered about the lack of this feature for over 6 years.

Another update that are useful is the ability to move your character
to home city when not logged in for 24 hours is also useful if you got
caught in a bad place.  ie a named raid levle mob decided to camp near
you and cut off your only way out and you have no gate spell or potion
and can't get a hold of anyone to help, just camp out and come back
the next day.

The one update I would like to see someday is the one that resulves
some million or so unfixed bugs.  I miss the long boat ride.
