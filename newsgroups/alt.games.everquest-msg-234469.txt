As a bard, I'm not sure how hard it would be to incorporate another click
into your routine, but I think if you just created a hotbutton to tell the
group to back off all pets so the MT can bring the mob back down, you would
have a lot of success.  If it's too much for you to do, I might suggest that
you ask the MT to let people know when to back off pets.  As a mage, I asked
tanks on numerous occasions to let me know when to back off the pet so the
mob can be repositioned.   I was rarely taken up on the offer, so I created
my own hotbutton that says, "Backing off my pet so %t can be repositioned".
That usually does the trick.  I've never played a beastlord and haven't
grouped with them often, but don't discount PC push either.  I almost always
use the same magician pet - Servant of Marr which is supposed to push less
than other magician PoP pets - and with some tanks walling is a problem and
with some it isn't.  Same pet, different PC's, different results.
