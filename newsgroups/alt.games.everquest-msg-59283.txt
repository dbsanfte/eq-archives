|It's not pvp it's Realm versus realm. 

	This statement is not meaningful.  The point of the game is
player-versus-player combat.  Anything prior to that exists only to prepare
people for PvP.

	None of this means anything.  I do not want to fight other players, ever.
By and large the people who engage in PvP are assholes.  They have no interest
in fair competition and no sense of sportsmanship.  I do not want to waste one
minute of my life dealing with them.
