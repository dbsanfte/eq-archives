ALMOST done that before.  Just to be safe, rather than clicking cancel, I
backed up to cancel the trade.

Accedently destoryed valuable over less valuable, but here we're talking
about a fine steel vs rusty, that I was planning on selling to the vender
anyway.

You know if you buy enough items from the vendor, it will eventually show up
in his inventory.  I'm not sure if there is a limit to how many things that
don't show on his list he can also hold (waiting to put on the list as you
buy up what he's got).  But I've noticed this from many vendors.  I sell
them something, then buy a few things, and either something else or what I
sold shows up.

Is this (or anything related to EQ) the reason?
And if it was, was it one of those "I could understand if it were me, but I
can't understand the exact same situation if it happened to someone else."?
