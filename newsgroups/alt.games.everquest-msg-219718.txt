Hehe I feel your pains ;) Youll get over it eventually though :) The
Inventory space will eventually seem "adequate" if not spacious. Not haveing
to carry thousands of components will make that a lot easier :) PvP is a LOT
different from Darktide, or even the PvP that was on the Blue servers in
AC1. Still though if I had it to do over again I probably would have started
on a Blue EQ Server too. RL Friends got me involved on Vallon Zek, and Well,
once youve got some established characters its hard to give them up. I dont
know anyhting specific about the Bertox Server, as the only non-pvp servers
that I play on with any regularity are Firiona Vei, and Torvon. Torvon seems
to be a great server. Its got the usual low population in the newbie zones
( as youve already noted on Bertox ), but it seems to have an active higher
level population. Most importantly to a newbie though is that the economy is
VERY newbie friendly. By that I mean that if a newb is a little industrious
killing the right things for thier tradeskill drops, you can make a decent
amount of plat and then turn around and spend that plat in the Bazaar on
very decent items.

Speaking of the bazaar have you looked in there yet ? Its an absoultely
AMAZING piece of work!! Think of the Arwic Subway with out all the vendors
shouting out thier "bargains" then tack on a UI that lets you search by a
wide variety of parameters for exactly what your looking for. GREAT way to
sell or buy things :)

As to grouping, yeah its a little more group intense than AC ever was, but
your choice of a beastlord mitigates that a LOT. Beastlords, in my opinion,
are the easiest class to solo with. GREAT pet, very decent range of spells
to us, and very decent melee skills. Add in the fact that beastlords are
very desireable in groups as well and youve really got a well rounded class.


What ever you decide to do though enjoy the ride :) Theres SO much to do and
see in EQ that it can be overwhelming :) IF you want to take a look at some
of the things that are available here are some web sites thats I have found
invaluable :)


http://eq.castersrealm.com

http://everquest.allakhazam.com

And once you have a feel for the mechanics of the game

http://lucy.fnord.net

Ive sadly not been able to find a website that is an equivalant to
Crossroads of Dereth.

If you have any questions post 'em here. I read the group pretty regularly,
and Im sure that if I cant answer the question there's definitely someone
here that can :)
