Then allow me to be the first to tell you to stay as far away as possible
from the third installment of the MoO series.

It really is shit, believe me.  I took it back after a week and the guy
behind the counter didn't even have to ask.  He just saw the box and when I
said I wanted to return it, he asked "it's because it's bad, right?"  We
talked about it briefly and he suggested that the unanimous impression was
that it was terrible.  Even though it probably was against store policy, he
gave me my money back simply because it was awful.
