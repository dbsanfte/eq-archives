Yes.  Barducks Darkpaw is who you kill to trigger the war.  He's a bit of
a toughie, but he doesn't summon at least, so myself and my shaman husband
could duo him starting at 54 if I did root-duty whilst he used his JBB and
epic to slowly pick away at barducks.  We used BArducks so we could learn
patience in killing things. :T

I killed barducks 7 times, never defended the city (nor did I zone out
after killing barducks...just kept killing gnolls for xp), and I'm still
Ally to the folks that get slaughtered, so I think those are in fact just
rumours.  That, and I don't recall any negative faction hit messages
coming at me out of the blue.
