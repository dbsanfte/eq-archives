More prevalent on some servers than others maybe?  On Povar, I do not know
anyone who isn't aware of this, and many claim it's happened to them.  Also,
and admittedly a far less significant issue, the cleric and wizard pets
despawn instantly when cast, making them an infintessimal amount less useful
than they were before.  Will have to /bug it next time.  The crash has only
happened twice to me, so I feel lucky relative to some of the other folks on
the server.
