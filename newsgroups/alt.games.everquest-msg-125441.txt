Some of the evil cities might accept you, but you can pretty much
assume that all of the 'good' races want to kill you on sight. Faction
work is tricky if you are new to it, so try to find a higher level
necro or two that doesn't mind answering questions (be polite).

Invisibility is every necro's best friend after their pet. Try out the
following link for one of the best necro sites out there:
