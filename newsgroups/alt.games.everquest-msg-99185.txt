I understand exactly where you're coming from. I guess I just don't agree
that it will hurt the game at large. It's going to be easier for the
powergamer types to breeze from 1-60 than it ever was, but they always
managed to do that in a few months anyway.

The casual gamer is still going to be the casual gamer whether getting to
mid-levels is slightly easier or not. It might help them get one character
to high levels in a little less time, but I still don't think we're going to
see everyone with a slate full of 50+ characters.

It might be easier now to take my Necromancer, who is level 39 now as he
approaches his 3rd birthday. But the 10-15 hours a week that I can afford to
play still isnt going to allow me to take my Cleric there, let alone my
Wizard, Enchanter, Warrior, or Rogue who are all level 20 or lower there
anytime in the forseeable future.
