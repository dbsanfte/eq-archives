I tried out that approach of putting windows up top, and it just
didn't work for me.  I MUCH prefer putting the text box on the bottom,
and then a thin line of windows across the top.  Basically what I
found is that I very rarely need to look right down at my feet, but I
am VERY interested in that giant or wyvern that is up on the horizon.

In general I like the new UI, but I find the fade on the spell gems to
be a pain.  I'm going to have to fool around some more tonite to see
if I can get just that window to stay opaque.  I love being able to
separate out spell messages into another window (at the bottom of the
screen, of course).  Makes sure you don't lose the "root has worn off"
message in the middle of battle.
