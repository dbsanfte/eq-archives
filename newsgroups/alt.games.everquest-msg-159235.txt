If one is a vengeful idiot with his head firmly entrenched within his

Zones that require keys/flags are usually easier in places than the key/flag
itself, the only exception to this that I can think of is Sebilis and it's
key.

I was soloing level 62 mobs pre-pop thx ice burrowers.

I never said that.  Please make citation.

Actually it does nerf players indirectly.  By increasing mob abilities
without increasing player abilities the relative power gap widens, no
different than if you nerfed the players themselves in some way.  This is
called nerf by omission, and as a druid, I'm no stranger to it.

So since light blues are as high as 57 (potentially higher, but not
confirmed) at level 65, classes that have low group desireability shouldn't
be allowed to get exp except at a significantly slower rate than anyone else
since anything that they can solo will be light blue (half exp).

So you're just bitter, and one of those whiny monks that should've quit the
game because he didn't have the world on a silver platter anymore.  I do
think they overdid the mitigation nerf, but it really was necessary to some
extent to preserve balance.

If I could get a group, hey, that would be great, but guess what?  People
would rather have another melee in their group for constant damage output
than a druid or wizard for some burst dps occasionally, and in the case of
the druid, a few utility spells.
