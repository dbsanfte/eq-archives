My 55 Paladin dumped his Deepwater Helm, with which he could heal
120hp in the same time it takes to bandage (and it works all the
way to 100%), because it wasn't worth carrying it around anymore
for a fairly small decrease in downtime when he soloed.  Why in
hell would he want to carry around a mess of bandages?  It's a
99.99% wasted skill for a Paladin.
