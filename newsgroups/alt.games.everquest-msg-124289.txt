I think its that way on all servers.  Early this morning I got my swimming
skill up and got a nice screenshot of a 4 skiff pileup.  1 stopped and
turned 90 degrees, another came and ran into it and got stuck.  Then a 3rd
one hit the other end making a U shape, then a 4th came from the side and
hit those 3.  I guess that final collision did them in and sunk them, as
they all disappeared within a few seconds.  Too bad they didn't actually
show them sinking, would have looked nice.

Has anyone ever seen one of the boats run into the ground or anything else?
A boat collision would be cool to watch, or be on. =)  Even better if the
boat got off track and started sailing across the zone.
