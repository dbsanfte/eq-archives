Horses cost between 11k pp and 100k pp. There are 4 different grades with the lowest being slightly faster than running but slower
than jboots and the fastest being close to spirit of cheetah speed. People can and do get that kind of plat. The horse is not meant
for everyone or the price would be a lot lower. It is meant as a kind of status symbol.
