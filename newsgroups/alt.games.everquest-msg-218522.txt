It makes it redundant. :p

Yes, so we punish the people to teach the government a lesson (which
seemed pretty much indifferent to the measure...).

In spite of the fact that zero evidence has been found? Sure, a few
things that MIGHT point to WMD, but can even easier point to totally
innocent things... I agree, Sadaam was a horrible man, but it's not
our place to initiate a revolution in another country.

And that is exactly the type of naive, arrogant bullshit that makes so
much of the rest of the world hate us.

I've seen no evidence that Sadaam was a direct threat to us. I've seen
accusations, but for the past 10+ years, he's been a madman who's been
hard-pressed to be able to do any damage outside his own country. I've
seen all the accusations that he had this, or he was helping "them",
but no proof of any of these.

The only "evidence" they've shown us of proof Sadaam had WMD turned
out to be a lie. A lie that Dubya passed on to us knowingly ( a point
which you seem to avoid. Something which is far more treasonous than
what Clinton has done ).

Let's not forget that little CIA leak that Dubya's administration is
responsible for as long as we're talking about giving away secrets...
