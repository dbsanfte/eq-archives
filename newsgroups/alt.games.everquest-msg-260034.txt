I've been off for four months and trying to access my account.  I logged 
onto EQ normally, clicked on the account icon and was delivered to 
station.com, everything keeps directing me to enter an activation key.

Do I need to contact Sony to reopen my account?  Nothing will let me get to 
a screen where I can enter a credit card.
