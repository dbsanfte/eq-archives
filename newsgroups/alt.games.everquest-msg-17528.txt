In a word, no. PCI cards are slower than the AGP cards of the same
line (because of the width of the bus and possibly, depending on the
configuration, distance from the CPU) and they cost just as much.
There are a few out there, but AGP has been the standard for years
now, and you're better off replacing your motherboard and getting one
that can handle AGP.
