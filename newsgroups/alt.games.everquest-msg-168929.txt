Go in the Factory in POI, take your first left, open the door at
the back of the hall, and you enter a room with some non-KOS
guys.

Immediately on the left is one who will chat with you.  Go thru
the chat and he'll offer to set you up with a trial of endurance.

This is similar to the trials in POJ, a party of at most 6 is
transported to a seperate closed area for a series of encounters.

We tried this yesterday.  Go in and there's a substantial wait (I
presume to let DS and other short term buffs cast by people you
aren't grouped with wear off) and then you get a few pops; robo
bugs.  These are fairly easy mobs, few HP and damage at the high
end of 250.  More pop, and more, and more.

We got up to 8 popping before we lost control and I had to DA,
enchanter mezed everything and then I healed myself... and more
popped.  So many mobs up, enchanter couldn't get them mezzed all
at once fast enough, and I didn't manage to keep her healed.
Then I had about 6 mobs on me and I went down FAST.  In short
order everyone else died from the 12+ mobs on them... except the
monk, who FDd.  He said more mobs kept popping, at the high end
he had over 30 mobs in the room with him.  Then they slowly
deppopped, until at last he was alone in the room with one mob.
He stood up and killed it and waited some more.   Finally he gave
up and used his gate potion to get out of the room.

Our bodies were back well before all the bugs despawned, I'm sure
he was in there well over a half hour total time.

All the mobs seemed to be mezable, and I'll wager they were
stunnable as well.  It strikes me that this would be an excellent
trial for an AE group, just stay there for ten minutes until the
maximum spawn is up, AE stunning or AE mezzing everything.  Then
go to AE stuns and drop the bomb.  Sadly most of the mobs were
cyan or even green to 65, so its not of much interest to me as
far as exp goes... but if there's a reward for killing all the
mobs that strikes me as one good way to get it.  And if you were
in the low 60s, it seems to me this would be a fantastic
opportunity, POP level exp in nice easy to generate chunks, no
competition, no worry about training people, no worry about
stealing thier mobs... the trial guy literally sets you up with a
good AE worth of mobs, free of charge, no need even to get a
puller!

Cleric, chanter, chanter, wizard, wizard, wizard, ideally... but
do you even need that much power?  Maybe chanter chanter cleric
cleric would do!
