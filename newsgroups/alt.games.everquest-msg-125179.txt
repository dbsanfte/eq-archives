Actually, its mostly a single guild on TM who does this.  I've seen them
with an entire group at the two most 'exploitable' spots; at one spot you
can round up almost all the seahorses in the zone, and at the second spot
you can round up sirens - both with almost no risk at all (unless you were
to go LD maybe).  Sirens used to be a lot nastier, but since the last NPC
caster change, they are pushovers.  They hardly cast charm or nuke anymore,
mostly rooting and trying to mez now.
Last night I saw a L43 wizard there, so I guess they have started PLing
their alts there as well.  It just boggles my mind to think that VI has
fixed much lesser pathing glitches in zones in far less time.
