Travel from SG out into Western Wastes, did succor take you half way thru SG
to a non aggro spot?? Succored thru last night and get slaughtered at the
succor point which I thought those were considered "safe" spots?? New
pathing take a Moktor right to the edge who attacks you, followed by the sea
lion like creatures?? Any one have a clue as to when this was changed??
Perhaps a better way thru SG to get to WW and to Halls of Testing???




Thanks
