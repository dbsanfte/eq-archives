Actually, in my opinion, Apple really did lose their way for a while.

In my opinion, Microsoft pulled ahead of Apple when it comes to
operating system technology when Windows 95 and Windows NT came out.
MacOS at the time was pathetically behind the times technologically in
many areas, probably the most important being, in my opinion, the lack
of true preemptive multitasking and lack of virtual memory (please
correct me if I'm wrong about MacOS having those things in 1995).

Fortunately, Apple got their vision back -- in spades! -- with the
release of MacOS X, which is superior to any operating system
Microsoft sells (in my opinion), and costs a bundle less (for both
typical users and developers).
