My druid is level 30 now (or 30 turnings of the leaf or whatever heh).

I hunted enough this weekend that I should have made 5 levels, but I made a
yellow bubble.

I've read alot about the 'Hell' Levels and I figure I'm in one then?

Couple of questions spring to mind:

1.)  How would one keep their sanity through this?  I can see me being in 30
for quite awhile since I only play a bit on weeknights (ok ok, and like
every freaking waking our on the weekends...).  I really am having the time
of my little druid life in Stonebrunt for now and plenty of blue stuff there
to keep me busy.  How long did it take you?  (yeah you!)  Is this normal?

2.)  How cool is it when you get to not stare at a spellbook at what? 35?
I'm looking for those warm-fuzzy types of stories to pacify me through this
time of much woe and reckoning.  Also is it like, ding - 35 sit down to med
and no spell book or is it ding 36, no spellbook?

TIA
