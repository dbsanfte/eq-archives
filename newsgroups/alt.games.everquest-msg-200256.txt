- There's no such thing as a "round" in EQ.
- Your secondary weapon's delay determines when dual wield is checked,
it has nothing to do with primary weapon delay.
- Your Kick has a delay of 70, iirc.
- At L24 double attack doesn't apply to your secondary weapon yet
(unless they've changed it, there's no chance of double attack with
secondary weapon until L29).

Unless his weapon was pretty weak compared to yours he should've had no
trouble keeping agro using Cease, which costs little mana.

At 52 Ranger gets a self-buff that's actually a hate debuff, forget
the name of it.  Until then it can require some thought and effort to
not take agro from a Warrior (a big slow 2-hander can be a help, also
handy when fighting mobs that have damage shields).  A Paladin or SK
should be able to hold agro without too much trouble if their weapon
is not too inferior to yours.  Another thing that can help you with
agro management is to stay as far away from the mob as you can and
still hit it while having the tank stand right on top of it, proximity
matters more to some mobs than others, but it always matters at least
a little bit as far as I've been able to tell.
