On Wed, 09 Jun 2004 19:55:17 -0400, I needed a babel fish to
understand Lance Berg <emporer@dejazzd.com> :

I personally would Highly recommend this class.  It is soloable when
there is need, and very usefully in a group.  You will have high DPS,
and various utility spells to help along.  Most difficult time in this
class will be between level 45 - 49 where your last pet (that  you got
at 39) will be difficult to use solo, but hey that's a great time to
head out to OT and grab a group.

This would be another recommendation.  Very soloable, and usefull in a
group.  Biggest issue is... not many people realize how useful they
are in a group.  But you can make it your goal to show people how
useful you are.

Had fun with mine, but he only made it to 15..  due to the fact I love
my Beast, Necro and Monk so much.

good luck in your decision.
