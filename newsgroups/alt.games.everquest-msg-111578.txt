As a rogue, I think of root as an evil, evil spell. And, on MObs that
need to have any kind of aggro management done on them, it's really
awful. Root makes aggro 100% proximity based and, as soon as it
breaks, switches back to the normal hate list. If I'm trying to
position myself behind the MOb with any number of other melees, I
often have to get in close to get into backstab range. If taunt does
not work, it's much easier for me to build aggro ahead of a main tank.

Slow is *amazing* on raids. Getting slow to land is often the
difference between success and failure on big MObs like Vindicator and
Dozekar.
