Believe they are required to for the cultural smithing armors or some
such.  If you got them foraging, don't worry about saving them.
You'll get *LOTS* more of them, damnit.

If you didn't get them foraging and just picked it up off the ground,
it's because somebody did forage it, got irritated, then dropped it on
the ground.

Plains Pebbles aren't rare, so don't sweat it.
