Of course, in the case of murder, there is harm done to another
person, so the comparison is hardly applicable.

Why is it so sad? What I feel is so sad is people get so worked up
over certain words. They're just words, for chrissake, it's not like
they hurt anyone. Yelling "FIRE" in a crowded theater causes a safety
hazard. Yelling "SHIT!" doesn't. Urging someone to kill the president
poses a threat to national security. Spouting a stream of obsceneties
only offends the over-sensitive.

Why is it inapporopriate? Because some stuck-up prudes deemed certain
words to be evil with no reason whatsoever? Seriously, WHY are these
words so shunned? WHY are they rude? Because someone somewhere along
the line didn't like the sound of them is my best guess.
