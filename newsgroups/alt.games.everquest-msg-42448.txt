Having never played a Monk I can't tell you what to expect. But from what you
have said so far I can assume this is your main character and that you won't be
able to twink it to high heavens.  So my advice would be to either partner with
a Cleric, or a Shaman.  Shaman being the better choice for most of the game.
    Partnered you should be able to take many of the blues and even some
white/yellows at your level with minimal downtime.  Even when I was level 30 as
a cleric I would partner with a monk who had his fighting batons and an FBSS
and we were kicking major ass.

Regards,
   The Nameless cleric who is still level 40 but hardly plays right now.
