    I recently got my niece hooked on playing EQ (just doing my job as
pusher for VI).  My characters are all on a different server from hers.  My
problem is: she is still very new at playing and doesn't have very many
friends on her server yet.  She has been repeatedly asked by several
different players to join guilds.  Not the same guild, different ones, all
new guilds that are just starting up.  I'm really surprised at this.  I
wasn't courted like that at level 9.  Could it be because she is playing a
cleric and everyone wants a healer/rezzer for the guild? I play a ranger,
never played a cleric at all.  I don't want her to jump into a guild and be
stuck in a bad one.  I also don't want her to alienate the few people she
has managed to form a friendship with.  Help!
    I joined an established guild that had a website and forums and an email
list.  We all keep in touch even if we arent playing at the same times.  The
guilds that are trying to get her to join are brand spanking new, and don't
have any of that yet.  They don't have any high level characters in them.  I
don't know what to do.  She is looking to me to give her advice and I
honestly don't know what to tell her.  Should she join one of them? Prior to
these offers, she looked at some guild websites and saw one that she is
interested in but when she inquired they ,very politely, said she was not
known to any of them and to get a few more levels and reapply later.  Since
then, she has hooked up with one of the members of that guild and grouped
with him a few times, so I think if she goes back to them soon and asks
again she may get in.
    I can't give her good advice about players on her server because she is
on a totally different one from me. I don't want her to make a mistake and
join a guild of troublemakers, end up dropping that one and then have her
reputation sullied by said troublemakers.  She loves playing and I don't
want her to be discouraged from playing by some of the outrageous behavior
I've seen.
    My niece's name is Coradeka, currently 13 Dwarf Cleric, on Tunare server
