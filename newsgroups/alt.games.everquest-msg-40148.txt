I made a couple of mules not too long ago.  The first was a female warrior.
She helped out someone as a level 1 (running an errand for a necro), and
wound up with a nice combination of ringmail, bronze, and banded as a
reward.  OK, I figure....she's cute....it was a flirting thing.....

So my next mule was a male Shadowknight... using the same scowling face as
the PoD, so he's fairly ugly.  Someone needed a low level evil to run an
errand.  I responded to the call, but started out sounding a bit snotty,
since I was roleplaying my sk.  But I go ahead and help the guy out with the
errand he needed me to run.  Despite my ugly looks and rough behavior, I
wound up with several pieces of patchwork, a crystaline sword, 25 plat., and
enough druid buffs to take me from level 1 to level 4 in relatively short
order.

Now instead of deletable mules, I have characters I'm going to be playing on
a semi-regular basis.

So I agree.. it's not just a "sexy pixel" thing.... much of it is how you
interact with other players, and a willingness to help others who are in
need.
