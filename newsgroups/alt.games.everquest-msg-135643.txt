Ever since the patch, I can't get past the "Establishing Connection to
Login Server" message.  Worked fine before the patch, then the patch,
now can't get in at all.  Now, it sits on that screen for about 45
seconds, responds with the 1001 error please try again, but then the
program crashes at that point no matter what I try to do (login again,
exit, etc).

Anyone else having this problem?  Looks from the posts like others can
get in, at least some of the time.

Gracias
