Of course, 10 minutes after I post this, I answer my own
questions.

Mages and Wizards do, indeed, get Channeling at birth, and Druids
don't.  The weapons skills I talked about are also granted at
birth.  So, of course, those don't need to be trained first.  Same
with Tailoring.

My poor level 11 Druid is now well behind in Channeling (since I
never put a point into it).  Darn it.

-Ed

P.S. What am I saving all my skill points for?  I don't know.
