Seriously, someone explain this to me.  I keep seeing the ads (with their
itsy bitsy print) saying how wonderful it is, but I can't figure out just
how it relates to the original EQ.  I saw it in the store last night, and
before I even think of shelling out $50, I want to know what this game is
exactly.  An expansion?  A standalone?  A "second" online EQ?  Do my
characters carry over?  Is it entirely separate?

If someone could toss me a clue, I'd be grateful, for clearly I have none
today.

Thanks.
