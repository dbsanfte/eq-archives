This reminds me of something that happens often in Marvel comics (or
did when I was reading them).  Someone, such as Wolverine, would be
about to kill a bad guy, and someone would remind him that doing so
would make the good guys no better than the bad guys.  The claws are
retracted, the bad guy goes to jail....and a few issues later, he's
escaped, and doing evil things again.

Just once, I wished Wolverine would have said, "I don't claim to be
better than him", and then slit the bad guys throat.  In the long run,
it would have solved their problems better than being "better" than
the bad guy did.

Using the ends to justify the means is dangerous, but sometimes is
called for.  The difference between us going to their level, and them
being at their level, is that they *stay* at their level.  I'd prefer
a world where no one is at their level, but they have made that
impossible.  The choice is between two worlds:

1. We try to play nice all the time, and they play dirty all the time.

2. We play nice most of the time, but sink to their level on occasion.
They don't exist.

As long as we can do #2 without it turning into:

3. We sink to their level to wipe them out, and then stay there
because it is easier than playing nice,

then maybe going to their level is the right thing to do.
