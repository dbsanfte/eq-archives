A 54 will get more aggro than a 55 would, yes, depending on
mob level.  The major difference, however, is resists to spells.
Level 55 is one level where the shift in innate resists changes.
A 55 will do a LOT better job resisting certain AoEs and spells
than a 54 in the same equipment.

But, yes, there IS a bigger difference between a 54 and a 55
than there is between a 53 and 54, for instance.  The same is
true for level 60, BTW -- a level 60 can do things a level 59
just can't.

I'm don't think that "aggro gets out of control" is a reasonable
explanation but there is a valid reason why some upper-level
guilds refuse membership to those below level 54...
