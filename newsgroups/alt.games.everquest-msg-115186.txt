I bound myself there.

When I was bound in the Nexus, I found myself waiting for ports down a lot.

If I need to hit the moon, I can wait for a port up.  Velious might still be
a pain, but the only time I'm really in a hurry is for guild things, and
there are usually porters picking people up for those.

I figure I can always re-bind in the Nexus if I change my mind.
