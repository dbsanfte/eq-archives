Star Wars Galaxies sucks total ass

I have had it with that piece of crap game

You want Sci Fi get Anarchy Online, or just wait for Worlds Of Warcraft if
you MUST leave EQ

BUT DO NOT...DO NOT get SWG
Simple as that and I quote:

http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=53200675&page=1

"You know, it's pretty funny when I took a huge ribiing for my review over
at Guru3D, and now watch as basically only 2 weeks later people start
agreeing.

Pretty soon it will be enmass. And that is a good thing - because next time
SOE might actually hire a couple designers instead of a violin player and
some old EQ GM's. Maybe Lucasarts can realize that they pushed out the game
too early. But, as I predicted the early downfall of SWG - I will also
predict the following:

Koster, the wonderclown, will maintain his infalliable artsy oil painting
approach and say that the genre just wasn't ready for his ideas. Well, guess
what Koster? No one is ready for your ideas. And they won't ever be unless
they have fun beating off with a cheese grater.

The suits at Lucasarts will also play the infalliable card and just say that
the market itself is saturated and fixed.

Meanwhile, when WoW hits the streets with content for the masses for hard
core and casual alike - with what will be the first feature complete MMORPG
to ever hit the mainstream - they will wonder where their 23 year old
marketing grads went wrong.

Common sense is not a hiring guideline for management in gaming firms. Think
it is starting to show yet?"
