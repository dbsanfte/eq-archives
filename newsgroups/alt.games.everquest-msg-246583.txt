/sigh

I bet you don't take what you read in the enquirer at the grocery store 
at face value too. :)

the ti4200 is perfectly fine for EQ, i have a ti4600 on my 2nd box and 
it runs eq flawlessly.

my brother runs a gf2 mx400 and its perfectly fine for EQ too (little 
laggy here and there but the whole system is pretty dated... with a P3-800.

As far as the HL2/nvidia issues go, the situation is more complicated 
than that. And rushing out and buying an ATi card to play eq... is 
solving a problem he doesn't have ... hell its solving a problem for a 
game that isn't even available yet, and which might not have a problem 
when it does finally release. Everyone knows both Valve and nvidia are 
working on it.

The cone of pixels problem the OP specifically reports I haven't heard 
of (but I haven't been following problems with dx9 either... but it does 
indeed sound like a simple driver issue, or other conflict.

Keep trying drivers, keep trying shutting down background tasks (tray 
icons, special keyboard/mouse config software, even the nvidia nview 
panel stuff etc). Check for firmware updates for your mobo and video 
card as well.

Myself I'm running the 56.64 version without any issues with the ti4600.

Good Luck,
