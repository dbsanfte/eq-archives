I recently completed a research project on dreams and MMOs. (Awhile
ago, I asked people on this board to participate in a survey/interview.
This paper incorporates those results.)

http://www.trinity.edu/adelwich/worlds/students.html

My project was conducted for Dr. Aaron Delwiche's "Games for the Web"
course at Trinity University. My paper, "Dreams and MMOs: Do avatars
dream of hero quests?" is one of 15 papers available online. Topics
range from games as therapy to virtual world law. Feel free to check
them out and send links to anyone interested. If you have any
questions, please use the contact info on the course website.

Thank you to everyone who participated.

Here is the abstract for my paper:
Given the unique characteristics of interactive virtual worlds, MMO
game play may lead to unique dream experiences. The author collected
data related to dreams and MMO experiences in order to discover the
ways that in-game experiences manifest themselves in dreams, and if
this manifestation is unique among dream experiences. Results were not
sufficient to identify any unique connections between MMOs and dreams.
Rather, these dreams collected in this study proved to be comparable to
traditional interpretations of dreams as residual manifestations of
events that recently occupied the dreamer's mind.
