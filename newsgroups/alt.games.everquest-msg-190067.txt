You should give gate a try.  I've successfully gated with the Kromriff 
Death Squad beating on me when I was level 52ish, a then red to me, shark 
of some type in Erud's Crossing trying to eat me (level 30ish), and the 
first time, while drowning and being beat upon by various mobs in 
Blackburrow on my very first miserably failed attempt to get through the 
place with no night vision.  Those are just the most memorable ones, it is 
often successful, not always though.
