I had been happily sailing along under the impression that all of your
melee skills topped out at 200 until you reached level 50. (or was it
51?) And since I had maxed out my 1HS, 2HS, Double attack, etc. at 200,
I was messing around with some less used weapons types to start building
them up. (Piercing in the off hand, for example.) Not really paying much
attention to the skill stuff at that point. Suddenly, last night in the
middle of a fight, I see......
"You've become better at offence! (202)"
and shortly after, another to 203.
Huh?
I was immediately worried because I know in some classes, skills, etc.
you can only have one skill that goes beyond 200 and it becomes your
"specialty" or whatever. What's up with this? Or was I bugged?
