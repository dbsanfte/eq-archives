It's generally considered that the best solo classes in the game are:

Necros
Druids
and Wizards, after level 29...

Magicians are quite good as well.

Shadowknights are tough to solo, and I certainly wouldn't suggest them
as a starting class if you just want to solo.  If you do make a SK,
try a Dark Elf.  They solo a little like a necro, but aren't as good
as it as the necro is.  They additional melee skills don't add enough
to offset the superior pet and spells of the necro.  However, they are
blast to play.  I like my troll SK.

Necros are darn good soloing classes, but it's through the use of
pets, DOT (damage over time) spells, darkness spells (DOT with a
snare, or monster slowing, component) and fear (to make the monster
run away).  Gnomes have good faction, so they can go most places.
Dark Elves make really good necros, but everyone really hates them
(faction wise).  Necros generally do not melee past a certain level.

Druids are, well, druids.  They get lots of useful spells early on,
teleports in their middle levels and are masters of the kite (at least
until 29, when the Wizard can start quad-kiting seriously with Bonds
of Force, a Snare area of effect spell), which means running away from
a monster and blasting/dot-ing it as it tries to catch up with you.  A
low-level spell called Snare will be memmed nearly your entire Druid
career.  They get some healing spells, and with damage shields, and
reasonable weapons they can melee pretty well in the early levels.
They are excellent outdoors, but suffer a little in dungeons.  Druids
also do not usually melee past a certain level.

Both high level druids and necros complain of not being useful in the
high level game, but I wouldn't know since I don't have a high level
druid or necro.

Best solo melee class, or at least one that a good argument can be
made for it: Monk.  Between a good bind wounds skill, Mend for instant
healing, and Feign Death to avoid trouble, I think monks make a pretty
good solo class.  You can certainly solo them all the way to 50.
