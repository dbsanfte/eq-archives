That's pretty much the same specs I'm running, and EQ works fine, as
does everything else.

That is extraordinarily unlikely. Nothing in the EQ program affects
other aspects of your computer. Any performance problems you're
experiencing are very probably the result of simple configuration
issues.

Run your Task Manager and take a look at what processes are using the
most CPU cycles.

Run a virus checker. Defrag your hard drive. Verify that you really
are running the latest version of your drivers.

None have been stated which seem reasonable to me.

By all means, try DAoC, but you'll probably want to really try it out
before dumping EQ. Many of us found that DAoC simply didn't hold our
interest well at all.
