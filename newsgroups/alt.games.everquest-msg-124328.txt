There was a post in the library on Graffe's from a sorcer who was
collecting pelts in the Karanas for tailoring and set a personal record
of forty some kills on one sword. He just ran round the zone clicking
everything he could find, letting it hit him once, and running on. The
sword valiently followed along slaughtering the greenies one at a time.

But useful? Apparently more of a novelty item.
