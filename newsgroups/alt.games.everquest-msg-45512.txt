Well, dual weild goes up pretty fast as it is, but aye, until it caps out
the first time a fast weapon would be for the best.  After that, the
skill only goes up five points per level, trivial to keep it capped with
a weapon of any speed.

Actually, as off hand weapons don't get the damage bonus based
on level, if you have two equal ratio weapons of different speeds,
the faster one should be in your primary hand, you'll do a lot more
damage.  (at levels over 28, for a melee class, that is.  Of course
AFAIK only melee classes get dual weild, so the "for a melee class"
part is likely superfluous)
