The easiest way to pull dain is to use 2 fders to split away the guards and
then when the dain and the dain only is near one of them is to have a cleric
remedy an active fder near the dain. Then when the fder fds aggro transfer
will have just the dain aggro on the cleric. The dain will warp through the
floor to the basement and the cleric can if he is lucky get of an
invulnerability that lets the main tanks build aggro.

If dont right the whole process takes only a few minutes, results in only
the dain being pulled, does not sacrifice anyone , and just generally all
around works great. It of course is a plan that takes more than the general
run of the mill uh lets charge thataway now :p
