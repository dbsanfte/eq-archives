I don't know anyone in a Guild anywhere near FoH's level to compare but just
because someone achieves "great" things in game does not mean that is all
their life amounts to. I wouldn't be surprised if he just manages his time
better than you do.
I don't play as often now as I used to but when I am on I can be on for
hours at a time and achieve absolutely nothing. Make a couple of levels on
an Alt-Twink. Farms some trade items or maybe get a quest piece (or at least
try to) perhaps just sit in the Bazaar and chat while looking out for
bargains...As you said, as long as you enjoy your time playing who cares?
And just because you or I could spend a couple of hours playing with no real
gain to show doesn't mean everyone does it that way.

Not that I actually have any respect for anyone in FoH, I just don't believe
because of the level they play at it means they have no life outside of EQ.
