From The manual:

Same Resolution Looting, Trading, Inspection, and Inventory (Velious Only)

Previously, when looting, trading, or viewing inventory, the screen would
switch to a lower resolution mode (that small UI in the center if you are at
resolutions above 640x480).  Now, if you are in resolutions above 640x480,
nearly all functions take place in the higher resolution mode.  Functions
that currently do not take place in the higher resolution mode will do so in
the near future.


I believe you have to click on SAME in Options and have velious.
