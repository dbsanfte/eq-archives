Be aware, though, that you need to do this *before* you actually
have the conversation.  "/log on" doesn't copy your current chat
window text to a file, what it does is copy to a file all messages
that come into your chat window *after* you turn on logging.

The text goes to a file in your EQ directory named eqlog_nn_yourcharname.txt.
"nn" is a two digit code that represents your EQ server.

If you turn logging on and off several times, the file is not
overwritten -- new text is simply appended onto what came before.

I find it handy to have logging on *ALL* the time, because you
never know when a message might come in that you wish you had
logged, and there's no way to copy a message to your log *after*
it has already arrived if logging isn't already on.

If you want logging to be permanently on, go find the line
in your eqclient.ini file that says "Log=FALSE" and change it to
"Log=TRUE".  Then, every EQ session you have will be logged
from start to finish without you having to manually
do "/log on" in the game.
