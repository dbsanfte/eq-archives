You've already received several viable suggestions, but here's another.
Go to Ocean of Tears and head to the haunted island where the gargoyles
live. You'll still be able to get xp off of them and, unless they nerfed
them recently, the drop rate of gargoyle eyes isn't too terrible. The
eyes sell to vendors for between nine and ten plat each. I've never
played a druid, but it seems that you could likely kite them aroudn the
shoreline of the island fairly safely as long as you keep your eyes
open. The eyes are lightweight and stackable. A stack will net you
around two hundred plat from a vendor.
