Well, after reading all the feedback here, I decided not to take the
wizard there at this time, so I just took the troll and Tiru (cleric)
along with a bored wizard from our guild came along. I'm glad I left my
lowbie wizard where he was. I could see how some xp hunting *could* be
accomplished, but the adds could be insane and the bigger cats seem to
have a fairly high MR for animals. I don't think my wizard would have
gathered LQ cat pelts very efficiently.

With that said, of course, a few level 55's don't have much trouble
there at all.  And yes, if what you want are non-ruined cat pelts, this
is indeed the promised land. We only had about two hours to play last
night once we got there, and were finding our way around, but we still
got better than fifty LQ pelts in that time. Very good zone for tailors.
All up and down the river, and in a bowl shaped valley to the west of
the cat city seem to be really high cat concentration areas.

I was dubious to the kerrans there. Tiru (dwarf) and Seniele (human
wizzy) were both apprehensive or indifferent so could probably shop and
do quests etc. though I couldn't without some faction work. Not sure if
there are quests to do, or just killing Kobolds, etc.
