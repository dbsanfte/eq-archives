If you still think that what I wrote were flames, what does that say
about your level of intelligence?

Allow me to address the questions you have posted durring our
exchange. (Using "?" to identify your "questions")

>>"does verant expect me to play characters in EQ2 just to leave those
>>behind also when they decide to bring out EQ3?"

Yes, and that was the whole point of this discussion.

>>"but you have a problem looking at your words don't you?"

Rhetorical, no need to respond

>>"but you are not flaming right?"

Sarcastic and not worthy of a response, though I did take the time to
explain to you what a flame really is. 

>>"well, its a growing entertainment niche isn't it?" 

Rhetorical no need to respond, as well as a point we agree on.

>>"I guess we'll see won't we?" (in referenece to what happens to EQ when EQ2 launches)

Rhetorical no need to respond

>>"hahaha, you not been around long have you?"

Sarcastic and not worthy of a response

>>"why the low numbers?  Same thing I am talking about...."

You answered your own question.

>>"is that a flame?"

Answer:No. (see definition of a flame)

>>"hmmmm... why didn't they update the game to keep up with the competition?" (in reference to Airwarrior)  Could it have been because they were putting all their
>>resources into the "new game" while ignoring the one that everyone loved and letting it far behind the curve?"

Speculation on your part, and not a question directed to me. 

From a programming standpoint there is only so much you can do with
old code. If a game (any game) is to evolve and grow with changing
technology, at some point a new code base will have to be adopted. AW2
was long in the tooth and there was nothing more that could have been
done to update or improve it. The decision to develop a newer sequel
was inevitable. The decline of the flight-sim market due to over
saturation of boxed and online sims casued a decline in revenue. Once
the game dropped below the threshold of profitablility they were
killed off. A similar future is in store for EQ1, but you seem to be
in denial over that fact.

>>"another flame?"

.Answer:No

>>"if I had said that to you would it be a flame?"

Answer:No

>>"your standards seem to apply to everyone but you, what do they call that
>>mr. intelligent?"

The word you are looking for is "hypocrisy", but it does not apply in
this case.

>don't think I didn't notice how you overlook the bit of our exchange
>that could be considered discussion to instead "educate" me on what a
>flame is.

Since you insist on misusing the word I felt that clarification was in
order. You seem to have a hang up about being flamed.

>your own words defeat you, maybe a bit of self-reflection is in order?  

May I suggest that you pick up a dictionary (or find one online), and
do some reflecting of your own.

Don't bother replying. There is no point in going any further with
this exchange.
