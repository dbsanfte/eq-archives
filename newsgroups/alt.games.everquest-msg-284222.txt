Hello To All....Here,s my story.My son recently was given a 2nd account by a 
friend.Apparently the "novelty" has worn off! Before he left(son) for a 
extended summer job in the "Rockies" he proposed that the "old man" take the 
account under his wing and"level" a character.Upon his return we would play 
together(pc and laptop) and spend some "quality" time fighting bad guys!! 
Well there are various lower characters ,so I took the reigns of a  level 45 
barbarian beastlord player.Figured the higher the better,since my sons 
account has mostly 65 and higher players.
                   Well Ihave a Dog?Wolf ?at my command..thank God he is 
smart! Keeps telling me the "target' is not suitable or something like that. 
Been spending my time(4 days) in a desert. Hunting skeletons etc etc,until I 
found a hill full of
Arab looking Giants.Well this should be easy..let my animal do the fighting 
again ,since I had become "somewhat "familiar with the key board commands(at 
least I thought)!!.Well the buggers were all over me and the next thing I,m 
on the Moon?..at a bind point??
                  I am now completely, unequivocally, lost!
After a newsgroup search,here I am at your mercy.
Would someone be able to help me with these questions

1) WHEN STARTING THE GAME I SEE THERE ARE "BEASTLORD" CHANNELS..WHAT IS THE 
COMMAND.../ ETC ETC..DO YOU USE TO ENTER THESE EXCHANGES OF KNOWLEDGE?

2) I PRESUME I NEED TO RETURN TO MY DEAD "SELF" TO PICK UP MY STUFF

3) I HAD A COLLECTION OF SWORDS,SPEARS ON ME.CAN I GIVE ANY OF THIS STUFF TO 
MY
"DOG" AND WOULD IT HELP HIM WITH HIS FIGHTING?

4) TRIED A.. /SHOUT.. COMMAND FOR HELP WITH MY PREDICAMENT..NO RESPONSE

Hopefully I can find a "game friendly individual" here

many thanks.....Peter Wolfe
