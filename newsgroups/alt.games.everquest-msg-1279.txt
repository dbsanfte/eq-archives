I have no problem with power-leveling at all, but it's just like anything
else; too much is a bad thing.  However, I can say that a good number of
power-leveled characters are idiots.  I was in an LTR group, in CT, and
noticed my 26 warrior soaking up all the damage.  The level 30 warrior I was
grouped with had a Taunt skill that was slowly rising through the 60s.

A level 26 Necromancer who told me he had a level 40 friend PLing him was
'impressing' me with how fast he had gained his levels, and how all he
needed now was good items...  What he actually got was an education on the
limitations of being a level 26 Necromancer with no strategic knowledge of
being a Necromancer.

I don't care how many level 60 characters someone has, if they're going to
power-level without learning their new class and maintaining maximum skill
levels; I wish they would avoid dungeons and avoid grouping.
