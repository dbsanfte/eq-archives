As you come out of the Unrest tunnel, walk to the edge of the cliff
facing the water and look over to your right. There's a pillar of rock
sticking up out of the water. Believe it or not, she spawns on top of
that pillar. Without Lev I think it's a bitch to get up there. (I only
did it with lev, and it was no problem.) If she's not there, stick
around for a bit. If anyone does her part of the quest with her, she
despawns for five minutes or so.
