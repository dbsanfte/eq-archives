Actually, that is my system, his is slightly better than that.  I have tried
a couple different versions of the video drivers, could you tell me
specifically which version you are running?  I have tried 21.83, which
worked flawlessly prior to SoL, and worked flawlessly with DX8.0a and using
DX8 in EQ prior to SoL.  I have tried the latest, 23.11, which works well in
most zones, it's pretty crappy in some Luclin zones, but then, maybe it's
that way for everyone.
