This doesn't directly compare with Stalk though.  The mages' damage
spells generate a lot of agro whereas Stalk is designed to lower agro.
I don't know of an ability that would generate less agro and still
generate enough to pull.  Moopy said that simply running behind the
tank is usually enough to lose that agro.  I don't know myself as I
haven't used it to pull in a group.

This scenario is much less likely to occur though if I pull due to the
massive range.
