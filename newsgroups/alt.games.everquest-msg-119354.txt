   He's not the only one.  As I read this thread, my jaw dropped.  I'm not nearly as
experienced a player as Biz is, of course, but I have been playing for well over a
year, and a goodly portion of that playing priest classes.  I read this newsgroup
regularly, have done at least a moderate amount of research on the web on each
character I play, and group fairly often and chat with other players in-game.  And it
NEVER occurred to me to dispel a self-buffed MoB.  Really, up until now this was on
of my "have on hand, but almost never use" spells.  Until now.  Oh yes, until now.

Annie <--- Yes, feeling a bit dumb right now.
