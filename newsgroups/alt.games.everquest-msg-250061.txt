Both - I personally tend to always group, but often it is a small group.
When I'm feeling ambitious (and I have the hours to burn), I'd assemble a
larger group and tackle something more difficult. Not once did I ever have
trouble finding a group.

I have spent a fair amount of time solo though (as a Warrior, with no
downtime), and I know plenty of players personally (ie, on my friends list)
who soloed their way to the max level (in a variety of classes).

I find the game much more enjoyable grouped - WoW has extremely high quality
group dynamics. But you can do either, and players do both. *shrug* Best of
both worlds. Hell, best of all worlds, since its also superior in every
other aspect to every other orpg I've ever played (and I've played them
all).
