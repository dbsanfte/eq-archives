I infer from his post that he wants to be self-sufficient.

Damage shields may not be necessary, but they're quite useful for most
of the fights a four-toon group will be able to handle.

No, he distinctly said he did not think they would be a necessity, given
that they would all have PoP.  I pointed out that they are still useful
even with PoP.  You won't find a handy PoK book deep within a dungeon
when you're ready to leave.

No, he specified a Shaman, not a Cleric.  Helluva difference there.

While it's handy for hunting (40 ATK buff iirc?) I was thinking more of
being handy for faction work.

I didn't say anything about going with a single melee.  In the post
where I suggested a set of characters there were two melees.  And
in a lot of the places where they might go for xp they'd be able
to get xp quite fast by handling multiple mobs (Druid and Shaman
could easily have a mob or two rotting while supporting the melees).

For all the fun it might be to have one of each of the WIS casters,
I agree with that 100%.

Nope.  He asked for a good combination.  The more varied the choices
we present to him (along with justifications) the more likely he is
to settle on one that suits him and his friends well.

Where is he specifying Cleric?  I don't see it.  Paladin can rez, tho
not for as much xp as a Cleric, and all he said was he wanted someone
who could rez.  So, if he decides that a Paladin as tank and rezzer is
the way he wants to go the Druid is an option.  And let's face it,
unless he and his frinds are either complete clowns or compulsive risk
takers they won't need rezzing except on rare occassions.  By the time
they're at a level where xp back from a rez starts to be important
a group that plays together all the time should be so solid they just
don't die unless they're deliberately taking big risks.

Oh, and if he does go Shaman and Cleric, I'd very very very strongly
recommend Ranger as one of the melees because of Snare from L9 and
Camo from L15 (Shaman does not get Invis until L29).  Other melee
should probably be one of the tanks in that case, but it isn't
strictly necessary given the Shaman's slows.
