This hasn't exactly made them available, however.  The components needed to
get research that high and to make the actual spells are, shall we say,
uncommon.

More importantly, the new vendor-bought spells just about completely replace
the old hard-to-obtain spells.  The high-level mez in OoW, Euphoria (L69,
mez up to L73 mobs) now only matters for 3 levels.  Once you hit L72, you
visit a bixie vendor and buy Bewilderment (L72, mez up to L78 mobs).

Euphoria is still nice to have, it's 75 mana cheaper to cast, it's under L70
so Gift of Mana works for it and focus effects work better.  But it's not a
required class spell like it was two months ago.

Likewise for charm - True Name (L70, charm up to L69 mobs) is currently very
hard to get, either by drop or research.  But Coax (L72, charm up to L72 mobs)
is for sale on a vendor.  And rank 2 is droppable (I know because I bought it
in the bazaar for under 100kpp).

Or just level up and ignore them.  Bewilderment is a pain to live without
during levels 69-71, but it's only 3 levels.  When 70 was the cap, it was a
completely required spell to have, and it sucked for non-raid enchanters.  Now
you can play the game without ever having it.

I should go back and check my bank - did they make runes droppable?  For no
good reason, I have an unusable 69 rune I should give to someone who needs it
if I can.  (I have all 69 spells, about half of 70, and, of course, _ALL_
spells from 71 to my current level of 73).
