The "Reluctant hero" idea behind a story has been around since the first storys
were told. Tolkien certanily doesnt own this idea.
It seems particulary prevalent in the heroic fantasy genre and normally follows
this criteria:
Tale begins in a hick backwater village/town/farm (The shire/Two
rivers/whatever the town in the shannara series is called) and we meet our hero
as an unassuming villager/townie/farmer normally in late teens who leads a
simple, honest life.
We soon discover that there is more to our hero than first meets the eye. He is
special, though he does not yet know it and is rejecting and disbelieving upon
discovering his own uniqueness, which knowledge may come from a powerful, wise
old wizard who has been masquerading as the boys grandfather/town loonie and is
forced to reveal all to the boy when the world comes under a threat that our
hero will eventually have to  deal with. It's not uncommon, at this point, for
the boys simple parent(s) (He may only have one, the other, usally the mother,
having mysteriously died long ago,) being slain with him barely escaping with
his life.
Cue dangerous trek to a relative safe haven whereupon a quest of biblical
importance is thrust upon our heros young shoulders and the rag tag crew he has
acquired along the way, its not unusual for this to be comprised of : The
hero(obviously), The wizard(who is wrinkly, grumpy, wise, weird, mysterious, in
need of a hairdresser) A member of royalty incognito fleeing from a dire
fate(possible love interest) one or two fellow hicks from home (who may or may
not have a uniqeness all their own) A tank ;) (carries lots of weapons, speaks
rarely, kills things alot) and optionaly a wrinkly old mad witch who is
possibly missing an eye.
Off they quest, odds stacked way against them, picking up the odd traitor and
other assorted party members. They have adventures, visit far off strange
lands, see wonderful and dire things and ultimately succeed in their imposible
quest. The End
fade out
Personally i think the idea of a nobody hick questing off to ultimate greatness
stems from old folklore, and the camp fire dreams of mud collecting peasents.
And its not that idea terry brooks shamlessley stole, it was other elements
from the daddy tolkien. I forget them now because i read the shannara books a
very long time ago but that wizard (whatssisname? Arkanon? or Arlon?) is a lazy
gandalf cloner.

Jeez, ive forgotten what my point for posting was now.
