The wife and I just started playing EQ. We started on the Vallon Zek Server,
because we have some friends that play on that server. I started a wood elf
druid whos now level 11, and my wife plays a 1/2 elf ranger thats now level
10. We have been mainly hunting in Greater Fay, and Crushbone, with brief
sorties into dwarf zone ( I Forget its name now... ). However, due to the
amount of people, and the at times rampant Shorty PK's were looking for a
less populated area where we can team hunt. My friend has reccomended Lake
of Ill Omen as a good spot for us. However based on what Ive read in this NG
it appears that Lake of Ill Omen is a "Dewd" magnet. Anyone have any Ideas ?
Were neither one of us good in a group yet, as we are still learning to
master or characters, and get a god idea of thier strengths and weakness. To
give an example Im not even sure what "harmony kiting" is. Ive used harmony
a few times so far, but Ive not really mastered how to use it most
effectively.

Anyways I guess Im just looking for any suggestions on where we can go to
get some decent Exp, and learn how to hone our skills to thier best. Im
hoping that things will get a bit easier for us at 14th when I can get SoW
and Bind Affinity.

Thanks in advance for any help!!
