You need to remember AE stun...it'll save your butt countless times.  I
rarely get nervous when I'm being beat on...the critter won't have the
chance to hit me very many times, usually, due to chain-stun and mez.  Well,
and I usually trust my healer.  Of the INT casters we're the most hardy
unless you count the necro's FD spell (which they rarely use...I gotta get
my necro higher to find out why).

When I was in dreadlands I was complaining in general that I didn't have
much to do...by the time I could get more than a spell off the critters were
dead.  So he pulled 5.  FINALLY, something to do. <g>
