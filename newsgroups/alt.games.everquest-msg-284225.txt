1) I've never used the class-specific channels much.  I do suggest
you type "/join newplayers", after which "/1 blah blah blah" will
send a message to the NewPlayers channel on your server, where you
may find more timely advice.

2) Yes, you need to find your corpse to get your stuff.  As others
have mentioned, you can either go to where you died to find the
corpse, or you can pay (game money, not real money!) to have it
summoned to the Guild Lobby.  Unless you get it fairly quickly
(within a day if you stay logged in, or within a week if logged
out), you'll no longer be able to get back the experience you lost
from dying, but that's not a big deal.  If you do wait a week, you
can also get the body back (and thus recover your stuff) by visiting
a place called "Shadowrest".  NPCs in various places can send you
there to recover the corpse, but only after a week has passed.

3) As others have mentioned, giving your stuff to the wolf is not a
good idea since you can't get it back, and the wolf goes away when
you log out.  The next time you log in and summon a new wolf, it
will NOT have the old stuff on it.  So either buy "summoned" items
to give to your wolf, or give it a cheap weapon that dropped off a
monster.

4) /shout calls out to people in your zone.  You didn't mention when
you tried it (while fighting? after you died?), so I don't know what
zone you were in.  When you died, you re-appeared at your "bind point",
which is wherever your son last asked for another player or NPC to
"bind" that character.  You'll have to find your way back to more
populated places.  The "newplayers" channel I mentioned above is
across the whole server, so will be seen by more people and doesn't
depend on where you are.

Mostly, though, it sounds like you're not very familiar with the game
yet, so if you're going to be taking an existing level 45 and trying
to raise it to 65, you really ought to go back and learn the ropes a
bit more.  I'd recommend you create a new character (if all 8 slots
are filled, try a different server) and take it through the tutorial
and up to at least level 15-20.  That really doesn't take as long as
it sounds, and it'll give you a much better understanding of many of
these issues.
