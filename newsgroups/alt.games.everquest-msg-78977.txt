Re-read what Orlun wrote. You are safe as long as you stay *behind* the 
mob. You have a Hide component, which can be seen through as if it were 
invisibility, and a Sneak component, which is much harder to see through, 
if you aren't in a direct line of sight. If you aren't sneaking, a mob 
will aggro you no matter whether you are in front of it or behind it.
