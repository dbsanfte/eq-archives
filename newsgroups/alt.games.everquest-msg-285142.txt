Heh, yes, you probably should have mentioned that. :-)

As you correctly recall, the damage bonus does not apply to offhand
weapons.

Also, if we'd known both weapons were being used offhand, we'd have
known you weren't talking about a 2H staff, and we could've avoided
all the discussion about 2H vs dual wield, 2H damage bonuses, etc.

On the other hand, the discussion was interesting in its own right,
and that's what we're here for, right?  (Well, except bizbee, who I
think comes here for the abuse*. :-)
