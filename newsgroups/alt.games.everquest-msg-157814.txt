There's no such thing as a "fake link".  Since the only thing
that is transmitted when a link is passed is an item number in
the Verant-side EQ items database (your client program then
asks the server for the stats of item #XXXXX and displays them
on your screen), it's impossible to make up a "fake" item and
pass a link to it.

All item links are to "real" items (i.e., items which Verant
actually put into their item DB).

It is, however, possible to make and pass a link to an item
in the item DB which no one owns yet, or which is never
meant to be dropped in the game but is only for testing
or GM purposes.
