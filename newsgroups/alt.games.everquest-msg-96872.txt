Rapid corpse decay is the only thing preventing massive overtwinking as it
is... so they take that threat away. And THEN they tell us that levels 1-10
are going to be faster to level as well!!!

Shit, why not just let ALL characters start AT level 10 and get it over
with.

Add to that Clerics getting partial rezes from level 14 up (and improvments
EVERY spell circle afterwards), and CRs truly are a thing of the past.

I want the XP lost in time wasted on CRs back!

The same with Hell Levels... I want the wasted XP for THOSE back, too! I
earned that XP the hard way, it's MINE goddamnit!!! I don't care if it bumps
me up a level or two before I'm ready for them... I fought for it legally
and now it's being stolen from me. This is possibly Verants most insidious
stealth-nerf EVER!
