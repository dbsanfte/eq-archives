First off, very few places offer fighting where there's NO chance of
adds.  I'm assuming a marginal amount of skill and intelligence on
behalf of the player here, but:

South Karana at the centaur village, Marus Seru, Highkeep (the two
goblin room is nice, although it's tricky to break the spawn), Gnome
city (depending on faction issues, natch.  My druid did well on the
mechanics there though.  Inviso getting there might be an issues, but
for 12pp can be overcome), or Iceclad by the gnome pirates.
