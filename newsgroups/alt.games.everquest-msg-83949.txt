Hmmm, well, I'm sure several regulars here would say that idiot isn't much 
of a stretch for me, but that's not important now.  :)
Anyway, I was really thinking that Drake is probably trying to ape your

cantankerous from crackpot.  Or maybe he really does understand irony and 
is just amused at how we can't see that he's being ironic.
