He's supposedly pretty rare.  I've killed him 3 times in an hour, and other 
times I wouldn't see him in a 4-hour stretch.  I am always on the lookout 
for him when I am in that area ( north of the windmill, east of the lake ).

Never had the ring, but always had the monk item.  Each time, I shouted it 
out to the zone that any Iksar monks will want the item, and noone came and 
got it.
