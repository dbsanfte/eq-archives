If you feel like trying a dungeon, get some good maps and check out Unrest, Befallen, or Najena.  Unrest in particular is only 3 zones from where you are now, and there may be some stuff in Dagnors or Lesser Fay too.

Oasis and South Karana are popular, but may be crowded depending on which server you're on.  Parts of Lake of Ill Omen might work.  I heard last night that parts of Overthere near the water are good at that level too, but I haven't tried it at that level because it's a
bit harder to get to.  The Karanas, the Gorge, and Lake Rathe have camps you might be able to manage in a group.  

I think I spent most of that level in North Karana, pulling beetles and things to near the bridge, but I also went to some of the dungeons and to Lavastorm.

There are dozens of other possibilities, see the eqatlas zone level guide at http://www.eqatlas.com/huntguidelevel.html

Try /w 16 18 all to find out where other people your level are hunting.
