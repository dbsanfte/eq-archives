Usually those not in one yet. If you could offer them an insta-tag
with a reputable uber guild, not many would refuse unless they're
truly casual players.

Yup.. but he still did it. So while he can laugh and chuckle about it
with you in RL, he chose to devote his time and energies towards
perpetuating himself in the guild in order to get the cutting edge
gear and stay at the top of the heap. Obviously it wasn't much of a
joke to him once he got online or he would have just /guildremoved to
go to lesser guilds.

And part of his enjoyment was seeing the new areas before everyone
else, experiencing the new content, and getting the better gear.

You were claiming people score based on gear, I gave you one of the
few 'scoring' systems this game have to offer. What you can kill is an
indication of how good your guild is in game, whether you agree with
it or whether you like it is irrelevant. This is how people rate
guilds.

>Not how good they are

Let me give you an example.. lets say every member of your guild could
play those Time level characters complete with access to the same
spots. You will get all their gear and so forth. Will you all of a
sudden be able to clear Time, kill Quarm, or even be able to kill 20%
of what the ELEMENTAL PLANES have to offer? Answer, sorry no.

>And where they are is largely dependant on their gear, and where
>they were last week...

Please, stop now. Doing the elementals on a successful basis, and
subsequently Time is a mattter of learning the strats and being able
to work as a unit. Strats you couldn't even fathom atm because you are
caught in an old style raiding mindset. Take an event like the Rathe
Council, an event that the first time MINIMUM will take you 4 hours,
2-3 if you get it honed. Its not something you can zerg(at least i
don't think a way has been figured out yet :>).. its not just a matter
of having everybody in the best gear. You have to know what you are
doing and in the right order with the right people at the top of their
game to get it done. Even then if you haven't done it it'll take you
3-4 attempts over a couple week period to get everything down.  You
think standing in a CH chain is bad? Try perma-mezzing a mob for the
next 3 hours that can kill you in a split second if it gets free.

I've seen PA's get through the app process. But almost always it was
someone who knew what they were doing having learned the ropes on
another character. J Q Public buying his way into the game is not
going to get him very far.

*sigh*. Need i point they kept their AA and flags? The requirements

Sure, by all those people who aren't at the level to even belong in
them. Do you think any member of said guild is gonna shed a tear that
LITTLE BILLY NECRO doesn't have his epic? Or even deal with Little
Billy Necro asking for epic raids for a piece of gear that is obsolete
to the level of play he is apping for? Have fun in the ghetto guilds
until you get your epic if that is what you are after from the game,
that is what they are there for. You're a joke of a player if you
believe a high level guild should cater to your epic needs.

Clerics, and very rarely, can be the only exception to that rule given
the eternal scarcity of good ones. And getting the cleric epic isn't
that hard along with having a raid level benefit, especially if they
have a lot of it done with lots of AA. Even then its done in offhours
usually by a group at most to get it finished up, and before the app
is accepted as a member.

You'd be surprised. If being good socially was all it took, we

Its also a matter of strats. There is a lot of information that needs
to be accumulated on what to do and why. That only comes with
experience.

Some fights aren't about dps. Like the Rathe Council, Xegony, etc. Or
consist of ring events that you have to learn how to handle each step
of to get the next to spawn until you subsequently reach boss. Then
you learn killing the boss with handling AE's and what not. And in
cases like Coirnav the dps has to be specifically focused with your
raid working in unison to meet the requirements in a specific length
of time or you get ejected from the zone. If you're just coming from a
Velious background the events will be extremely weird.

Having seen Remington's comments.. he's pretty much on with how you
handle these scenarios. All guild members are allready told /ooc,
/say, and /shout are to be filtered so as to not distract the guild
from zone chatter. This limits the GM to /tell each person with the
question. At the same time, if you are even a little bit late on the
response its explained in one sentence of having been afk to take a
crap while this GM stuff got figured out. And really, when you get
right down to it your typical GM as it stands doesn't HAVE the time to
deal with some of the BS guild issues that allready arise, playing
Inspector Clouseau on a guild, especially after you pass the first
question or two gets old fast. Whatever question you ask though can't
be universal. I did like the right/left variant. Heck.. having random
guild members ask in different ways if their petition for item X that
got lost or accidentally destroyed earlier has been handled is a GREAT
way to get the GM to drop the matter fast hahahahahaah.

>Link me your sword.

This is easy to have a button for.

>/say crunchy monkey.

Filtered.
 
>/tt what did i just say?

/say was Filtered.

>I'm swapping breastplates...(swap swap)  what colour was the one I was just
>wearing?

Inventive. But any live person at the raid knows that. You have Global
Response list:. Fill in Blue. Along with the tell interface accessed
through a drop down menu that brings up the most recently /tell'd
windows with Post GR button on each. When you click the Post GR button
you get dialog box select text from list with the most recent addition
being highlighted and in list select name of the person you wish to
send it to from a list of the 3 people to just /tell you with the most
likely one being the GM being highlighted. You then get:

'Sir... I believe it is Blue. BTW, I was wondering if you handled my
petitions???'
'Um... blue'
'Oh.. its blue. Is it ok to ask you about my petitions?'
'Blue'
'You mean Blue?'
that that gives a list of each tell window
'Bleu' folllowed by 'Blue* lol.. stupid typos.'
'Blue lol'

Then just walk down the list as the GM /tells people with the most
recent unanswered tell continually migrating to the upper left. As the
GM changes the answer add it to the global response list. At the same
time if its something like left/right... another button to view the
PoV of the person accepting tells, page back, and select proper global
response. You can also notice that if you replace 'blue' with 'left'
the structure still holds. If you have 100's of these randomly picked
through an RNG and removed from the list once used, it would be very
hard to see the pattern. And before you jump my bones on some GM being
stupid enough to say.. sure... what petitions.. every now and then a
treasured item is accidentally destroyed or dropped and recorded in
the disinformation window :>. A properly setup program can really
disseminate a lot of information in a short time. There are a LOT of
assumptions that are made about 'bot players' because most people have
thought of them just using the normal EQ interface and playing against
the type in the right way can really convince someone they're on the
up and up once the initial programs are setup. And if needbe, since a
real life person is running the list of people in your raid asking
questions.. one person or even two can more than keep up with the GM
specifically /tell'ing each.

>Or /tt target one... what is 6 x 5? wait for 
>/tt target two...  and that divided by 10 is?

How does target two know what was said to target one? Was the answer
requested in /say? Still.. if GM's go about doing this in such an
adhoc manner they'll be laughed the servers over. Your 'test' needs to
be concise, one reasonable question, and clearcut as to seperating the
'bots' from the 'humans'. Hard thing to do, easy to obfuscate.

All of which are handled with the same contingency programs humans
use, except a program can see all unengaged targets entering the area
and turn the add tanks or enchanters to see it, target, assess and
then give the appropriate response. The real trip though is when you
realize you purposefully build in common mistakes on lesser raids or
even major ones that go off randomly. Some of which can be recovered,
some of which are meant to wipe the raid. Hard to claim a bot guild..
cause really.. shouldn't they have been perfect? NO mistakes? The
easiest way to tell a bot or even a macro program is behavior that
real players could never do. Insane response times, never missing a
target, etc.

It wouldn't need to be that micromanaged other than. MULTIPLE ADDS INC
PICK THEM UP. Or MULTIPLE ADDS INC FOR MEZZ. ASSIST THE MT. The add
tanks know what their job is. To target an inc unengaged mob and keep
it occupied while their healer heals them. Once they engage they use
the tanking and then assist calls to trigger the slows and heals as
they become available. Random errors could be introduced so that 10%
of the time the same add gets picked up by two add tanks... you let a
cleric get hosed.. and then pick it up proper. Nothing that really
wipes you, just errors introduced to give the appearance of human
frailty.
