I have a question regarding faction. When killing certain types of
creatures boosts your faction with a group, and that creature has a
range of less/more powerful versions, does the faction change
generally vary with the difficulty of the creature? I'm not talking
about named ones; what I mean is does (for example) killing a
Blackburrow elite gnoll guard increase your faction with Jagged Pine
Treefolk more than killing a gnoll pup?

I'm wondering because I have a couple characters whose faction I want
to increase this way (Heretics via Warrens kobolds, Qeynos/Surefalls
via Blackburrow gnolls) and need to know if it's best to take the time
to chase down and slaughter every last kobold runt, or concentrate on
the higher-level ones?
