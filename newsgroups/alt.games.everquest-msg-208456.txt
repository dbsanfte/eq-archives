Create gnome
Attack your guildmaster
Run to POK book from your spawn site in Steamfont
Run from AkAnon book to Kelethin book
Loiter in GFay near that POK book till ready to start

If the OP wants to really pile up the bodies in CB, he should have someone
at the CB line in GFay with Bind Affinity (and hopefully KEI) ready to bind
people there on the spot, so when they die they need only zone in.  And it
would be helpful if someone kept the mobs at the entrance there dead or
pacified/harmonied, so that the incoming gnomes could get in and be able to
pause long enough to get that bind.  (yes, anyone can run the gnome in and
over the zone line... its stopping with 4 orcs on you that's difficult.

Barring this, the Gnomes might want to jog up to the souldbinder in
Kelethin, which isn't that far from the newbie lift which in turn is pretty
near that POK book.

If the horde is to roam, binding in POK at the soulbinder would be handier,
its just one more zone from CB if you really wanted to pile bodies there
though.
