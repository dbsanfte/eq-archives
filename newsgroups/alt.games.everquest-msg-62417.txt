Stealing rare critters? Yeah, EQ certainly all-out encourages asses in SRo
for the AC, that's for sure.  That's why it's highly unlikely I'll ever have
a pair of jboots...I choose to avoid assholes.  Stealing quest
critters...yeah, DAOC does it better.

But rare and quest critters are such a small part of an average EQ player's
experience that I rarely think of those.  If I had before, I would have
mentioned then that I've never had anyone steal a rare or quest critter from
me either.  If it's happened to you more than once, maybe it's you. :)  If
it HAS happened only once, lemme paraphrase you when talking about similar
instances with non-rares/quests...get over it, another one will be along.
