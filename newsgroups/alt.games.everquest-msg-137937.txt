Have you ever heard of Maslow's  hierarchy of
needs(http://www.connect.net/georgen/maslow.htm)? Essentially what Maslow's
theory states that in order to engage in the free will choices you are
referring to (i.e. to overcome one's genetic tendencies and do things for
the good of all) one's basic needs must be met.  These needs include having
enough food to eat, a shelter in which to live, feeling loved, having sexual
needs met, feeling a certain level of self-esteem. I'm not intending to be
bigoted, but if you do some research you will find that many (if not most or
all) of those who use the "genetic predisposition excuse" haven't had these
baser needs met.  According to Maslow this leaves them incapable of making
the cognitive decision to move past these predispositions.

Perhaps if prejudices and other such obstacles were removed (rather than
utilized as a defense) the negative actions would also cease?
