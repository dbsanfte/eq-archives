Umm, warriors need to kill the Queen.  She is much, much, much harder than 
the Prince.  She is much harder than the King.  I would go so far as to 
say that she is harder than the King and the Prince at the same time.  It 
took us quite a few royals raids before we got to where we could drop the 
Queen every time.  We have pulled the entire Prince room on us while 
buffing and cleared it without any real trouble.  The only way a single 
group is going to kill the Queen is if they are all wizards getting 
critical nukes, with resists above 300, and somehow staying out of melee 
range.

I finally finished up the bard epic, and even though it's listed as one of 
the hardest epics (and probably the 2nd most useful, after clerics), I 
don't think it's that hard.  We have one fairly rare planar drop (amy 
tentacle from fear), one tough but common drop off of a fairly common mob 
(phinny spine), one easy drop in an exp dungeon (drolvag warlord head), 3 
drops off wurms (2 soloable, one needs single group and a LOT of time or 
luck), and 3 dragon drops.  
The only hard part is that the red and white scales either drop off of 
dragons that are level limited to 52 or off of rather difficult dragons.  
The spawned Trak is probably hard if you haven't done him much before, but 
when you've killed Trak a dozen times for teeth, he becomes routine.  (I 
know he can be killed with 18, I suspect the right 12 could do him.)
I think the first steps of the bard epic are actually very well thought 
out and play to bard strengths, but I wish they required more bard skills 
than running around.  Maybe force you to adjust your faction, charm one 
mob, and either kite the others away or mez them while doing your quest 
steps.
