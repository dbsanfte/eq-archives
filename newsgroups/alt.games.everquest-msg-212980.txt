You can duo to 65.  Heck, if you really really wanted to you could solo 
to 65 with your cleric.

There are any number of nonPoP zones where you can level all the way to 
65 without having to deal with PoP hard hitting mobs.  You can get to 65 
just sticking around LoY zones.  There are mobs that are dark blue to me 
in at least 3 LoY zones.
