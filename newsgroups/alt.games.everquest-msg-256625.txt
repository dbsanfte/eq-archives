i didn't find it that hard.  i already had a ton of the ice of velious from
fighting in PC.  the other component that could not be bought was words of
dimension, which drops off monsters that are about my level, so if i wanted
to i could have just gotten a group together and headed to one of the places
where they drop.  the level 20 spell can be either bought or researched; i
researched it because i had all the research components already.  the only
reason i spent the 100pp is because i was too lazy to haul my ass over to
lake of ill omen to find the words.  2 tries and i got the spell, not too
bad.  'course, i am only level 24, so it could get harder at the higher
levels, but then that's to be expected.
