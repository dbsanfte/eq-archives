You are a registered mesopath.

However, you do seem to be committing a grevious error... if
you let your pet do more than half the damage to a mob, you
get only half the experience.  You are letting -him- eat -your-
exp, if you feel he's more powerful than you are now, wait till
he hits 60 and you are still a level 30 lowbie!  Think he will
put up with your thoughtless mistreatment then?

Seriously, get some counselling, preferably in the form of
a hunting partner; two players expending even partial
effort can reliably outdamage a single pet, denying him that
phat exp he's been sucking off of you, now he's only going
to take 2% rather than his current 50%.  Two pet classes
are particularly amusing, as now each pet has for competion
two players -plus- the other pet!
