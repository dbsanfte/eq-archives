Paineel newbie ground is easy to get to from Erud, and one of the better
starting gardens in the game (1 to 3 or 4)

Crushbone is now painfully easy to get to from Erud.  Go to the Wizard
spires in the Tox, tell the Scion there "I will journey to luclin" and wait
(up to 15 minutes) there.  You will port to Nexus.  Now walk out
one of the passageways to find another spire with a "Faywer Scion"
Sit on that pad a few more minutes and you are in GFay.  Now go to
the Kelethin or Felwithe Soulbinder to change your bind spot, and
go play!

Imagine, a trip that was nigh impossible for a real newbie (yes, an
experienced player can run Paineel to Ak'Anon at level one, naked)
is now a walk in the park, and no begging needed!

Hmm, 19 I think.  Been a long time since  I played a mage, and almost
as long since my last nightblind character.  I'm told that almost all Nightblind

woes were alleviated in a patch a couple months back that increased their
vision to near infravision levels...
