According to Paul's post in this thread:

I must add that I forgot this point: Wolfie Form is not a faction 
buffer, it CHANGES it, in positive or negative; it depends of the 
zone that you are roaming and of the local factions: in some zones, 
NPCs that cons apprehensive or worse for you will cons indifferent 
or better when you are in Wolf Form. In other zones, apprenhensive-
consing NPCs can cons even worse if possible, up to be KOS 
sometimes. Be aware of this when you are porting/zoning to a new 
place and always prepare a quick Camo when just arrived or look at 
zone description on Web sites such as www.eqatlas.com (sorry for 
the advertising, I am NOT working for the webmaster).
