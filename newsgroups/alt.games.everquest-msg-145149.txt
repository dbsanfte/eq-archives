Hehe, now you sound as popular as my druid do when entering GFay. Just 
tell them its 900 mana, and you expect 1pp pr mana spend, and theyll 
leave you alone.

Oh, and its not only chanters who get begged for KEI, a 56 non-anon wood 
elf warrior from guild got begged for KEI today, go figure. Hes only 
used to sow, heal and port request (appearantly all wood elves are 
druids, even when wearing platemail and dual wielding Frostbringer and 
the sword from the general in Echo).

Personally i only got KEI from a stranger once, and that was for a port. 
KEI is nice, especially for soloing, but its not that required. Its nice 
to be able to sit down and relax a little.
