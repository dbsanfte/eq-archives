I don't pretend to know how they are calculated.  I also notice that
Celerity has a duration of 16 minutes (160 ticks) specifically called out,
whereas WR had zero listed for the duration according to the information you
posted.  My best guess would be that if a duration is actually listed, it is
used, if not, then some formula is used.  I have never tested the duration,
and can only go based on the information I have seen on various websites.
