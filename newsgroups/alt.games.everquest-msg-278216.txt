Well since WoW subscriptions are falling like flies (all those who
started at release and play regularly have at least 1 lvl 60 if not
more), I would think they're trying EQ2 now.
Luckily for WoW still lots of new people playing after reading the 90%+
reviews in magazines, etc.  But reaching max level so quickly makes me
wonder if the game will last more than a year
