Many thanks to those that have answered me - a lot of good pointers there
for me to mull over .. Also thanks for the links, I'll take a peep in a
moment. As for the Mage, well, to me a Mage is somewhat similar to the
Wizard in that they dish out heavy nukes, so that doesn't interest me. I
must admit, I'm fascinated by the Necromancer, I did try it for a while,
taking him to level 16 or so, but I found that it was very much a 'give
here, take there' class. For example, steal hit points from the mob, give to
myself, heal the pet, take away from myself - I got rather confused! LoL ..

Many thanks once again ..

Regards ..

Stevie.
