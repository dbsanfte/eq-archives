Excellent post.

Along the same lines, I'd like some thought be given to zones
where you have a reasonable chance to find a group at level X,
but if you can't, you don't have to go more than a zone or two
away to do something useful soloing.

More and more lately (at level 56), I find myself forced
(by the layout of the game) to either:

1.  Go somewhere where I might be able to find a group,
but if I don't, I'm in the middle of absolutely bloody
nowhere with regards to being able to solo, or:

2.  Go somewhere to solo, and be some <insert huge number>
of zones away from anywhere where I could check out grouping
options.

I prefer to group, it's more fun and entertaining, but
most of the 56-appropriate grouping zones become a total
waste of time if you strike out finding a group.  So more
and more often, I just head straight for the solo-able zones,
and spend another boring evening bonking the same critters
over and over again -- it's slow and tedious, but at least
I'm guaranteed not to be stuck doing *nothing* productive,
which is the case if "LFG" turns into "still LFG an hour
later".
