Frankly I think they should do away with the prizes for gambling idea and
just put a slot and or poker video machine around all the major city's sorta
like it is all over Vegas, that way players would not all group to one
location to play which is beyond me why they didn't think about the server
bandwith issues in the first place, also they could make a variety of
machines which are taylored to the area they are found to play on such as
some sleek gnome looking machine in Kaladin or a wild wood elf one in GFay
with bows, arrows & bullseye on the wheels etc.

Also they should make a variety of wagers on them so if you only have a
copper left then you can bet a copper, if you got enough to play five lines
using plats so be it, why not it's just another game with in a game like
it's been done before but over due by SOE.

As Ks Qs Js 10s Royal Flush (I WIN) Yeah !!! 100,000,00 PP WOOT!!!

Would that be worth seeing instead of just another day of hack, slash & cast
:)
