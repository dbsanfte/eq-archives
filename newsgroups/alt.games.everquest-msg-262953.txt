I think my favorite part was when Brad said this was a good thing, because
it would allow newbies to "sell thier services," gouging high levels for
quest items they need but can't get to drop themselves.

If it's that easy to get around it, then there is no point to actually
having it.   It would seem that the only people it would negatively impact
would be those who aren't out to farm, but happen to have someone a level
too high when a mob popped.   For the farmers, it's just an extra hoop to
jump through.   And a trivial one at that.
