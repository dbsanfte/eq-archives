Which is irrelevant if the team isnt' KOS, so they just walk up
to the mob, put their guns against his head, and all pull the
trigger at once.  Assuming he goes from indifferent to dead,
there's no need to worry about what his reaction to the
gunshots might be.

Now I'd think having to spend hours in MM between Gore
kills would be a nuisance, and heck, for a band of wizards,
perhaps not even risk free.  Not particularly lucrative
either, what are you looking at, about 60Kpp in loot
divided six ways, so average 10Kpp... and you have
to spend how many hours getting non KOS so you
can do it again?  Hours of no exp grinding, mind you?
Screw that, dump a three of the wizards, pick up
two chanters and a cleric, and go AE, probably end up
with more money than that and for sure more exp
and fun.
