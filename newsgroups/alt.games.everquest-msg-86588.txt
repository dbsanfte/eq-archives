I disagree. It all depends on what your priorities are and what your hunting
play style is. Not everyone plays this game just to race to 60.

For instance I am several levels above the people I normally play with
since I play much more than them. So this gives me a great opportunity
to let them catch up and still improve my character and help the group.

Also, the extra regen skill is a huge plus to my down time, which
will make any more levels and AA points I gain much easier and
faster to attain. Anything to reduce downtime is a must. The over
camped and high priced regen items in the game can attest to this.

Also, the innate run speed could save your ass in many cases.
Thereby actually saving you experience.

The other thing is I am not in an uber guild and do not have the
time or patience to go on uber raids and get uber items. Or to
do long boring camps. This AA stuff gives me a chance to improve
my character hunting any exp giving mobs I choose. So I can go
off and hunt in under used areas.
