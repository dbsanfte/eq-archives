Neutral evil is probably best. With neutral evil you could group with
an order evil and a discord evil and they will both get xp penalites
where I belive you'd get no penalty nor any bonus.

That alignment is only for players though, it does not change Npc
relations which are still based upon your diety, race and class. So
for a dark elf necro of Innoruuk, your faction with npcs will be as
bad as on any server.
