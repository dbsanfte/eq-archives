Levels >> ALL...at least up to (and including) level 60.  I imagine level 65
is probably better than 60 (mine's 61 with no rush to be stuck hunting in 3
zones if I reach 62), but besides the new spells I'm betting that the
difference isn't very noticeable.  But hell yeah, get level 60...the aggro
radius alone is a good reason to do it. :)

Maybe you just threw SCM out off the top of your head, but if not, it's a
bad example as it's not very important to save 30% mana in the vast majority
of cases.

Meanwhile that 56 with 14AAs could have been at least a 58-59 had he stuck
to his guns and gotten those important levels.
