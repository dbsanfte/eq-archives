Here's my warped view of the situation.

The people that did it are dead. They died in the plane crashes.

The people that told them to do it are wandering around somewhere. If we can
get their names, we should demand extradition and a trial.

Knee-jerk retribution against a group of humans based on proximity to the
suspected ringleaders is pretty sad (but to be expected).

The truth is that we as a species are territorial and prone to violence. We
desperately search for a reason to hate, fear and eradicate those who don't
belong to our tribe (based on Race, Sex, Geography, Religion, etc.)

I see no difference between retribution against Afghanistan and firebombing
the house where Timothy McVeigh and his family live.

Oh well, the ends justify the means, an eye for a tooth and the world will
continue to turn...

Here's an excerpt from a Roger Waters song I was listening to that seemed
relevant to the calls for retaliation I've been reading:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Hey bartender over here
Two more shots
And two more beers
Sir, turn up the TV sound
The war has started on the ground
Just love those laser guided bombs
They're really great
For righting wrongs
You hit the target
And win the game
From bars 3,000 miles away
3,000 miles away
We play the game
With the bravery of being out of range
We zap and maim
With the bravery of being out of range
We strafe the train
With the bravery of being out of range
We gain terrain
With the bravery of being out of range
We play the game
With the bravery of being out of range
