Most caches are time sensitive. I've been using EQAtlas for over a
year. Even if that meant that I had my cache set to the default 30
days, I would be downloading the zone maps is use most frequently at
least a dozen times each.

As it is, for business reasons, I have a zero-day cache for my
browser, which means that I've downloaded some maps literally hundreds
of times.
