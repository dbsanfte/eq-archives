I have my 8 songs setup in hotkeys:
/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast 1
Some will say it is better to not use hotkeys at all because it is slightly
quicker to just tap the spell gem twice but it is *much* easier this way.
For a starting out bard I would say it is ok to just go to Katta Castellum
and buy all combine instruments.  If you feel like questing you can do one
in Shar Vahl to get you a main hand lute.  It's kinda nice, but far from
necessary.  Find Reed's spreadsheet at eqdiva.com, download and print it.
