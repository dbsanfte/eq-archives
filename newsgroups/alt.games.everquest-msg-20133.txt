There is a rare bracer you can get off of sarnak legionarres in the sarnak
fort in LoIO.  I think it's called "bracer of the hidden".  Not sure if it
still drops or not, but a couple of months ago I heard someone shouting that
they got one, but I haven't been there since, so not sure if people are
still getting them.
