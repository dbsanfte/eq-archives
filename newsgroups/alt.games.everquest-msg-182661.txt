Every flashlink site I've seen has been, to put it bluntly, a
festering pile of feces. So I won't be paying for their stupid fee.
EQlizer, which I always thought of as Allakhazam's poor second
slightly retarded cousin, went to flashlink which sealed my opinion of
it.

I don't see any reason to pay alla's fee either. if he had NO
advertising, THEN asked to pay a fee for the further features I'd be
more apt to do so but not with those stinking attractwomennow banners.
I don't even need the features you pay for, I almost always already
know what mob in what zone drops an item when I look up the item so I
don't need to do things like display items by zone. I require
something more value added and original than what Alla's site offers
for a "fee."

The only site I've paid for ever is magelo. I pay for it because it
offers a REAL service, the magelo character display while if you pay 
it updates it on the fly from in game (INCLUDING your bank) AND gives 
you a magelo certified icon with the date and time to show that it
is a REAL character/item display FROM the game. To me that is worth
the small fee for several months.

Face it, all the other pay sites are simple hobbyist sites with NO
WORK and ZERO SKILLS. Allakhazam's is nice, but its nothing more than
a database of PLAYER submitted info. It is now what it was when he
started it, a hobby and not a "business." Magelo is more of a
business, with a specific "product" which evidently is not easy to
imitate. You can tell the guy did some real programming with that
thing.
