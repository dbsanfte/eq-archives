*grin* For well over a month, a lil greenie in Kunark was dropping
that earring :) Someone in my guild told us a friend of his had gotten
this, but nobody seem to believe it was more than very random chance.
One day, I decided to check it. Killed the mob, got an earring,
grinned evilly at never having had buggy loots work for me before.
Killed it again, got another, had a guildie come loot it. Third mob,
yep, earring, grats another guildie. Log for an hour or eight, log
back in... and a dozen of my guildies are actively farming the earring
*sigh*. By the time I got online again next morning, GMs had noticed
and told us to stop exploiting and to destroy the earrings, which I
did but have been mildly annoyed about for the past month.
Fast forward to this weekend, when one of the larger guilds is doing
what we did a month ago, to the extent of petitioning someone for
ninjaing an earring from them :) GMs finally permakilled the lil
greenie after that :)
Someone claimed it was only screwed up on EMarr, but I don't know for
sure. And there shouldn't be enough legit Marked Signets in existence
that it should be a problem having all of them run to Grimel :) (220
in all tradeskills and lots of high flags to do the signets, yay)
