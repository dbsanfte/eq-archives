>>Certainly untrue.  What gave you that idea?<<

...err as I said, personal experience alone. I just never get any skill ups
in brass if I am playing a song with no direct effect on any mobs.

Having said that, I havent tried teh same thing with AAS recently, perhaps
that'll work.  I left my Bard online playing Brass overnight, NO Skill ups.
Tried the same thing in Shar Vahl pit, next to teh spirit, and voila! Brass
maxxed.

No idea why, othre than the song was actually having an effect.
Apocryphal,? Yes!

As I said in my post - personal experience.

Hoep this clears it up.
