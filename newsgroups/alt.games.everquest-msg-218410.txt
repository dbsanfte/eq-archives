He already has a lot of spotlight, my guess would be that's not it.  I
still hope it's altruism since there's so little of that anymore.
Were I wealthy and no longer needed to work to keep my lifestyle at
par I would run for office as well, with nothing in mind but trying to
make things better.  I think this country is the best on planet earth
but it could still improve.
