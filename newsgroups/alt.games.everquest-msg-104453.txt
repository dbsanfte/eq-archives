Probably not.  Common, and as far as I know, never punished.  There is 
always a chance of something going wrong and drowning, so I don't 
think this is something a GM would stress.

Yes, in almost every case.

Generally no.

Nope, not at all.  In certain cases this can be incredibly satisfying.  
Nothing like watching the jerk who has been training and ks'ing you die 
right in front of you.  The best part is killing the almost dead mob for 
exp while standing on his corpse.

 > 4) ninja looting

Yep, ninja looting hurts faction with both other PCs and with GMs.  GMs 
hate having to deal with idiots, and ninja looters are huge idiots. 

> 5)Kill stealing

Yep, but kill stealing may not mean what you think it does.  Kill stealing 
is not taking mobs from an area that someone else is camping.  Verant 
does not recognize camps, though most players do.  In Verant's mind, KSing 
is killing a mob that someone else engaged first.  First person/group to 
engage a mob has rights to it.
