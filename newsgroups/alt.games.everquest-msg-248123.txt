First off, you have no idea how much data that is.

Imagine having to wade through every player who hands a stack of dots
to a guildie. Every person that twinks a newbie RL friend. Every
player that moves a couple tens of K over to a boxed alt. Every person
who returns a borrowed weapon. Every player who accidentally steals a
camped mob, and so hands over the loot (I've done it when someone was
not obviously there to take the mob).... seeing the problem with this
plan yet?

Second of all, it's a question of what you do to that player when you
find them. Do you take the item away (plan on bumping the cost of
customer support WAY up)? Do you warn them and then never do anything
about it (plan on everyone ignoring you)?

Ok, now you have the offenders, and you know what you want to do with
them.... how do you pay for the time spent doing so? Jack up fees
(outcry)? Reduce development staff (outcry)? Reduce support staff
(what support staff)?

This is a very hard problem, and not one that has a simple answer.
