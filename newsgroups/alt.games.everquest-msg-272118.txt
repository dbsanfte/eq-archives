Part of the problem is that not everybody was affected, so it might not
have shown up on Test anyway.  Out of the 30+ people online in my guild
last night, only 1 had characters missing body parts, and 1 other had
the hotbar issue.  The rest didn't have any problems at all.  None of
them complained about HOs not working.

The only problem I had was a tradeskill instance crashed - but there
was a warning about this on the forums and I managed to create two
complete stacks of drinks after spending a bit of time shopping.  I
would guess I spent over an hour in the tradeskill zone before it
crashed, and a bunch of people were in there before I was.

Overall, I think all the good things that came with the patch outweight
the bad for those involved.  Of course, then there are some people that
aren't ever happy no matter what.
