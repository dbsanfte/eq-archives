You dont have to play two games to do that. I was in a GOD sewer trial the
other day on my druid as main healer. I got chatting to someone I usually
group with my ranger with. The bard pulls a mob inc, and I dutifully plunk
up, neatly position myself behind the mob and turn on autoattack while
gossiping. At about 30% health the MA says 'Um, Neko, are you planning
to heal me or are you just meleeing from now on?'

I should have noticed when I started getting 1hs skillups, I suppose ;)
