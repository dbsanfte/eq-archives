I already asked in s.age last night but I want more opinions on this.

Last night I was discussing with my guild how I was thinking about 
picking up another piercer.  Someone mentioned a quest involving the 
dwarves then mentioned I should pickpocket the guy while I was there.  I 
said I hadn't gone back to greens to up my PP skill in some time and 
didn't PP in groups due to the hostility issues of mobs coming up with 
less than they should quite constantly.

Then I got a personal tell from someone telling me that they 
pickpocketed all the time with their rogue, and nobody ever noticed.  
Now, this to me seems fairly unbelievable.  After my group left in Rathe 
the other day, I wandered around seeing how I did at PPing giants.  I 
got 21 platinum off of one giant (poor kiter who pulled that one...).  
Granted, from most giants it was 20 gold or the like, but considering 
that some giants *only* carry that much, it seems like I have a fairly 
good chance of emptying these guys out fairly blatantly with one 
pickpocket.

Now, when I was in HHK, I'm fairly certain I got stamped as "PPer".  
There was another rogue around at the time and he told me he PP'd all 
the time and I should too.  I decided to pickpocket but not loot if I 
was interested in getting my skills up.  But after awhile, I could *not* 
get a group.  Didn't matter if the group was full or not, heck I even 
bought myself a 1hb while waiting for a group there once and asked a 
group if I could equip just the 1hb and practice with it, and got told 
"yes" then 1 minute later "I change my mind you can't practice your pp 
skills on our mobs".  "I said *1hb* not PP" was my reply, and I didn't 
get another answer.  I stopped playing my rogue for awhile after that.

But in turn, everytime I turn around rogues tell me "groups expect you 
to PP" as well as "groups can't tell when you PP".  Now even I can see 
the logic missing in that one but ... I've been in a few places where 
I've overheard muttered comments about how the rogue is pickpocketing, 
and I *was* under the impression it's fairly noticeable at higher levels 
(well, lower too - hard not to notice when you get "stop thief!" 
screamed out every 3 seconds :)).  Can you tell when the rogue in your 
group is PPing?  Do you expect them to?  Do you hesitate to group with a 
rogue *because* of that skill?

Personally I just go up the skill on greens and suffer the dullness, 
but...

Meh, I dunno.  I just needed to rant I guess :)
