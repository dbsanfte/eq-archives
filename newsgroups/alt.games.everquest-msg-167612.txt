Your wrong. Everyone has to fear the repercussions that other players
can administer. If you relentlessy grief newbie players, don't be
surprised when the newbies call in some of their high-level friends to
grief you instead.

Let that be a lesson to you for gating into enemy territory alone and
unprepared. Dumbass.

I've been bind camped, trained, pk'd by red cons, killed while naked,
killed while equipped. You name it, I've died to it. Despite all that,
my main has made it to level 58 without too much hassle, and a lot
more excitement than I find on blue servers.

Which is not to say that PvP is for everyone. If you can't take the
heat, stay out of the kitchen. The other night I pk'd some newbie, and
he immediately started cussing me out in tells. Really rude stuff
about f*cking my mother. I hadn't camped his corpse, or repeatedly
killed him, or trained him, or anything like that. Just dropped him
when I saw him like any good ogre would do to a wood elf snack. People
like that, that freak out so bad when they get dropped should not play
PvP. In fact, all his cussing did was give me reason to camp, and
grief him if I got the opportunity. Around the same time, I killed
another newbie, and allowed him to loot and scoot. Even led him to his
corpse, and let him know when I was leaving the zone, because he had
acted like a man when taking his death.
