It sounds like a "permissions problem" with respect to some fo the
required files and possibly the DX9 drivers.  I am running XP PRO and
aside from the "patch created problems" I have not had any trouble
running EQ, but I am the ONLY user and run as ADMIN at all times.  I
did notice that when I upgraded to DX9, that I ahd to upgrade my video
card drivers to keep EQ from vanishing and crashing.   

Not sure what the specs of the system you are running it on, but here
is what I have with XP PRO and it works great.  I have been running
this about a year now.......
