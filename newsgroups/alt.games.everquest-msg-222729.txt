  Icky zone.  There seems to be a very simple formula in EQ.  ZEM bonus (this is
what give kickass experience in PC) = IAF (Idiot Attraction Factor).

   Tell the mage to roll up a necro his own damned self and then play it the way
he wants.  If, or should I way when, he tells you that he has a level 65 necro
in the top raiding guild on server, with epic and the most expensive horse, tell
him to get on the horse and ride it to another necro that might be clueless
enough to listen to anything his dumb ass has to say. 

 If he persists in his advice, simply tell him "If I gave a shit, I'd give it to
you."

   I would tend to agree with this assessment.

   Depends on how cranky I was feeling at the time.  I'm feeling kinda cranky
right now.  I want a martini, dammit!
