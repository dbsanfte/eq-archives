Relevant to nothing, but how much an hour would they have to pay you
to work at one of those HOT DOG ON A STICK places in a mall?  You know
the place where they make their employees wear those fucking
ridiculous uniforms with the damned silly looking red, yellow, and
orange hat that is shaped like, to keep it tenuously on topic for the
group, an erudites head.

For me, at least $30 and hour.  I don't have much pride, and scarcity
is what dictates price.
