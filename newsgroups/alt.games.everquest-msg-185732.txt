    My favorite Dreadlands borxup is when you agro a mob and run back to
your group... only to find the mob hasn't joined you. You run back out, try
to find it...... very very gone. Didn't see which WAY it went. So you pull
another, and continue for few mins then suddnely out of the blue your
drolvarg comes back and wallops you. You're halfway through chewing him down
to the groudn when the first of his buddies arives. Soon a steady stream is
pouring in to your group as every drolvarg in the zone trains to your group
one by one. If you survive, it's bloody good experience.

    I've seen it happen once with drolvargs and twice with drachnids......
hair raising stuff.
