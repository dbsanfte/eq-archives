Dunno what is meant by "poor", exactly -- ?

/agree. I've never for one moment had the slightest interest in EQ
tradeskilling.

mudflation.

/agree somewhat. The mudflation isn't really that bad, but it is present and
the game experience would be better without it.

/indifferent.

Hmm, not sure exactly what the complaint is. Personally, I find aggro
management to be one of the more interesting aspects of playing the game. A
tactical challenge that separates competent groups from incompetent ones.

So? What's the problem? It's a game system, not a simulation.

"Realistic" in what sense? What is the complaint exactly?

Yea the quest system is pretty silly. The great majority of questing
experiences are just chores to get through, starting with looking up a
walkthrough, and therefore uninteresting as a use of playing time.

And this is when questing moves from "silly" to "ridiculous". Some of us
just laugh at the idea of going through all that is involved in getting an
epic. Honestly, on what planet am I going to pay $12/month for the privilege
of sitting in front of my computer screen for 6 hours at a stretch for a
week, staring at the same corner of a fantasy dungeon waiting for a
particular toon to appear?
