I wouldn't worry too much about Targishin. I've never seen him near the 
entrance to the ruins, so as long as you are bound there and not deep 
inside the ruins, you should be fine. 

However, if get bound there, I would still recommend moving away from it 
after you appear there just to be careful. I would also recommend knowing 
how to get to the Swamp of No Hope (the closest zone line, besides Kaesora) 
in the event you get attacked.
