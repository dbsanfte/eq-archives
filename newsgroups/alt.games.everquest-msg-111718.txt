    Then tell us how to handle a wait that's (on Morel Thule at least) 70
clerics deep. Shall they all get their guilds to camp Ragefire 24-7 for the
next YEAR until they're all done (at which point I'm sure another 70 clerics
will be waiting)? You've seen the insanity that results when two guilds both
race in a zone for a pop - imagine ten guilds racing for the same thing
because they know nobody will respect a "camp".

    The worst incident so far on my server involved three guilds all trying
to claim first hit, first aggro, kiting the dragon and counter-kiting the
dragon, triggering the dragon early because they thought that gave them
rights on the dragon, calling in a GM to force a roll-off between EVERYONE
present (some clerics there hadn't brought their guilds in yet, but hey,
they can ask to roll too, right?), and the eventual ninja-looting of the
heart. My guild is up to four clerics that don't have a clicker, and I dread
having to go through any of this. So does our server GM - he's at the point
now where he pops in as soon as Ragefire pops (because someone inevitably
petitioned to have "their" camp enforced), and forces a roll between anyone
that can get sufficient force there within a certain time window. Camp that.

    The cleric epic is backlogged. The backlog needs to be cleared. Until it
is, no system for Ragefire will work.
