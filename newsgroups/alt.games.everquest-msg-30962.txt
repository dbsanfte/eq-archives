Hate to say it, Hesten, but you *can* solo a Warrior in younger years.  In fact, if
you're careful, you can solo a Warrior right up to 26.  I did.  (Not all the time was
spent soloing, but I solo'd effectively at each level.)  I stopped when I got bored
with it, and was glad I did... But at 11, he could easily take on some of the stuff
in Everfrost.  (Once you get out of the peaks, it's a non-newbie zone.)

I do, though, agree that Warriors are not a solo class.  Anyone who tries to solo a
Warrior for their entire career is asking for a lot of disillusionment (and a lot of
rezzes).
