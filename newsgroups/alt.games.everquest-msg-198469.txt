A few data points:
Druid  L37 sta97  hp739  [(15 +  (97/20)) * 37 = 734]
Druid  L19 sta96  hp381  [(15 +  (96/20)) * 19 = 376]
Cleric L10 sta85  hp197  [(15 +  (85/20)) * 10 = 192]
Druid  L9  sta85  hp178  [(15 +  (85/20)) *  9 = 173]
Druid  L1  sta100 hp25   [(15 + (100/20)) *  1 =  20]

Hmm, it appears that the one-off is just a flat +5, nothing to get
excited about (except maybe if you're level 1, heh).
