I am trying to sell acrylia and i have large bricks, but no one will buy
them because they say they need small bricks only? Can't large bricks be
converted into several small bricks, or otherwise be made useful?

Also, is there any market in studs or boning, as i am about 100 in tailoring
and have just gotten plate to trivial, and was hoping i might be able to
sell my stock better if i did some more preparation on it?
