Alas, other folks interpreting the law won't always have you there to
interpret it for them. :( THAT is the real problem.  I think you are right
about what the intent of the law was, but I'm not completely reassured by
your interpretation.  Here is the passage from the S-DMCA:

---------------------------------
"Any person commits an offense if he knowingly (1) possesses, uses,
manufactures, develops, assembles, distributes, transfers, imports into
this state, licenses, leases, sells or offers, promotes or advertises for
sale, use or distribution any communication device: 

"[i] (skipping this)

"[ii] to conceal or to assist another to conceal from any communication
service provider, or from any lawful authority, the existence or place of
origin or destination of any communication,"
---------------------------------------

So we're interpreting the phrase "conceal from any communication service
provider...the existence or place of origin or destination of any
communication".  According to some, that could be interpreted as any
device that uses NAT (network address translation). According to others
that could be firewalls.

I don't know about you folks, but my hardware firewall is pretty thorough
at concealing my place of origin.  It looks like I only have one computer
running (unless you are knowledgeable about OS's, in which case you could
look at headers and extrapolate the number/nature of computers running,
but...), when in fact we have anywhere from 2-4 at a given time.  I could
easily define this as "concealing the place of origin" of my
"communication".  

EFF suggests that the following phrase be added to the end of
section ii:  "provided that such concealment is for the purpose of
committing a violation of subparagraph (i) above;".  I'd be happy about
that.

(I didn't list subparagraph (i), so as not to make this too messy.  EFF
has a line-by-line rundown of the bill on their page if you want to see
it.  It's actually not so scary.  Well, accept they use a lot of red ink
and whatnot to show what lines they would cross out, and boldface to show 
what they would add. www.eff.org)
