Speaking of druids, there are quite a few who suspect the monk nerf
has accidentally become a leather class nerf (we got our own secret
nerfs - our animal MR debuff will now draw aggro and cannot be
refreshed on charmed pets, and our charmed pets lost all their
wondrous regen), as they, too, have been dropping like robe wearing
casters in stuff they used to be able to tank long enough to get
something like a broken charm under control.
Personally, I am not sure what I think, but both an occurrence where a
Di'zok Sergeant hurt me a bit more than anticipated, and a couple
occurences of Chardok dogs missing me half a dozen times in a row,
have made me suspect something's fishy.
