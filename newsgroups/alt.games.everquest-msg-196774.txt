I honestly can't imagine having nothing else to spend the money on. Even if I
didn't have my current If-I-Won-The-Lottery laundry list (tiny bit of remaining
debt, savings, helping out friends, buying a house, all the little things I'd
love to get, etc.) there are so many things that would be a better way to spend
money than buying things that don't actually exist IRL. Heck, spend some on EQ
equipment if you really want, and give the rest to a worthwhile charity. So, to
answer your question, still lame. Even more lame, in fact, because someone with
no imagination just wasted 300 million USD.
