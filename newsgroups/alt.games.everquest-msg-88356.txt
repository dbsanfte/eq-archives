Interesting.  EQ was causing my machine (Athlon XP 1600+, 512MB DDR,
Win2k, NVidia GeForce 2 Ti) to panic reboot at random intervals with
21.83 drivers installed.  So I downloaded and installed the latest
reference drivers from nVidia's site (32.11?) and, other than a small
(but annoying) degradation in performance, I have had no problems except
for a single disconnect while zoning that presumably had nothing to do
with the video.
