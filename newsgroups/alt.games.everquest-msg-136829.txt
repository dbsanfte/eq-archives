You're walking down a busy street when you come across a newspaper box. A
rather interesting article catches your eyes, but your hands are full. So
you set your purse down on top of the box, pull out a quarter, and take your
newspaper.

When you set your purse down, does it become fair game? I'd hope not.

In my opinion, it's a very similar scenario.
