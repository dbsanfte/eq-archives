No, since newgroups are free and accessible to all, we get to advertise 
in "your" newsgroup subject to the opinion of the moderators.
That EQ is a pay site has nothing to do with it.

I don't recall claiming anything otherwise.

OK I see what you're getting at. There is the argument
"if you didn't play then EQ wouldn't be this popular so we wouldn't 
advertise here".
That's true. It's true for TV advertising. It's true for adverts on the
street.
If we got no players from this forum, we wouldn't bother advertising here.
If you want to interpret that as blame, then fine, but to me its just
practical.

So because I take the trouble to explain myself, I am a weasel?
I didn't have to do that.
Exactly why did you think we advertised here? For fun or by accident?
What have I said since that has changed your opinion?
I've told you I appreciate the complaint, and I've told you we will post
infrequently if at all. That the advert wasn't removed despite a
complaint, leads me to believe that this is acceptable.
The tone of your response to this mail makes me want to think 'screw 
you' and advertise here more often. But as I said, I appreciate the 
complaint, and we won't do so. If the general response to the advert had 
been aggressive, then again we wouldn't post, there would be no point. 
But it wasn't.
Perhaps you don't speak for everyone in this forum.
