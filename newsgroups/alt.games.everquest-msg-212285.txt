Yep, was going to say, grab five level 65ish people of the appopriate 
classes to produce maximum DPS, have them drag your through the trial.  
Alternatively, level up to 60+, get in a group of similarly levelled 
folks, again, going for maximum DPS, and try the trials.  Get a decent 
map of PoJ to find the appropriate places.  www.eqatlas.com has such a 
map I believe.
