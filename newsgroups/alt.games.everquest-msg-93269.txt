It was locked a couple times - first time I'm not sure what happened
but four or five people started shouting about lost items (some very
expensive ones no less!) about the same time.  (A lot of LDs about
then as well and zoning times were ridiculous.)  Server came down
shortly after that.  

A few hours later there was a broadcast message that people were
having trouble signing on so they were bringing it down.  After that
lockdown things were running one heck of a lot smoother.

I lost an entire yellow bubble - and a bit of a blue - of xp (I'm a
lvl 22)  in the mess after I accidently hit the 'a' button on an NPC.
One of these days I'm going to learn *not* to do that!
