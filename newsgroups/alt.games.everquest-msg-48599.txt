*I'm* curious as to what he thought of as Diatribe. It sounded like
quite an interesting description of the culture on the new server to
me. I didn't read any random ranting or vitriol directed at the
other players, even those little PK Ganky tadpoles waiting for "noobs".

Weird. I think I'm going to christen this "The Bizbee effect". That
point whereby somebody becomes so consistently apoplectic at a posters
occasional ranting and raging that they completely lose the ability
to be objective and suddenly become archetypical_angry_stalker_bizbee_001


Hmm. Actually, now I've outlined it I fear its so frequent its probably
already got a name...
