Ah, not exactly. The mistake was they forgot to turn it on at 8am. At 7.45am
the GM on the Chat Server was confirming that it was happening on schedule
at 8am. And at about 8.15pm he confirmed that it had started ....

My group decided that if they couldn't even get that bit right, we were not
going to risk signing up and some getting to move while others got left
behind.
