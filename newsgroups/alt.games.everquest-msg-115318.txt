Hehe, impressive that a raid leader dont even bother to read up on the 
mobn you want to kill.

And telling someone to bind at the fight spot should be a federal 
offence, especially when the mob in questing are a AoEing dragon.

Think we lost half our force the first time i was on a Faydedar raid, 4 
groups beween 50 and 60.

Last time we only lost 1, a level 60 shammy who fell asleep just before 
we started, and happened to be standing at the pull spot.
