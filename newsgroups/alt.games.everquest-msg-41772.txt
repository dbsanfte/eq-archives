Well, your post is so long that I cannot hit 'reply' 
without crashing my newsreader, but I'd just like to say 
that if you're going to start judging *my emoticons* I 
don't think there's anything more I can say.  I am 
highly insulted that you would *again* try and paint me 
as uncaring about this event, even after having it 
explained to you what I meant.  And what the hell would 
I put a smiley after that sentence for??  A smiley is to 
point out *amusement*.  I've felt guilty putting a plain 
old smiley after *any* sentence lately, actually - every 
"LOL" I type with a friend seems like the act of 
forgetting what happened, and ... yes.  It makes me feel 
bad.  Now that I have pointed out how I feel, I would 
appreciate it if you would stop trying to tell people 
that I feel other than I do, because it is an insult to 
my emotions and frankly, it hurts a lot more than any 
normal flame would do.

I'm afraid I cannot cite my sources on the radio - I was 
listening to a random station on the way to work, and 
they were taking quotes from several people giving press 
releases.  So go ahead and believe I made it all up for 
some purpose that only you, apparently, know of.  I'd 
rather be talking with friends than wasting my time 
defending myself to you and your little emoticon 
deconstruction methods.
