As a lvl 65 cleric I have always started casting complete heal at 40% health
or earlier depending on mob. If the MT was down to 20% health I would cast a
quick cast heal to get MT up then cast CH. Ever since I got CH I have done
this, my job is to keep MT alive because without this most likely we all
will die. Saying this there is some exceptions I have often let the tank die
to keep the chanter alive so that chanter can keep mobs mezzed while I res
back in the MT. After explaining this to group when I get the usual WTF
complaints the rest of the group can see my point of view as if the chanter
had died quite likely we all would have died.

Cheers,

Wayne
