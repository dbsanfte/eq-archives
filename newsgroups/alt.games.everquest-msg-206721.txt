You know what I find the oddest thing about this game? Outside of you
saying "SWG", everything else you detailed doesn't seem like it has a
damn thing to do with "Star Wars."

What I'm reading is, you got star wars galaxies.
As suggested by players a lot, you made an artisan.
You did surveying, after getting killed.
You sold stuff.

HIGH ADVENTURE IN THE LANDS OF STAR WARS!!!

;)

Still waiting until I hear more about this thing. Unlike you, though,
I still have the beta client on my computer and just ran the launcher
to fully patch it again.... ahaha.
