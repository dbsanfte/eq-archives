I have no opinion of your guild.

I have a strong opinion about one policy, which you claim I don't 
understand...and I'm open to enlightenment.

1) Does your guild recruit people who are 50% or less raid attendance?

2) Does your guild keep people who become firmly entrenched at 30-50% 
attendance? People who clearly aren't likely to ever achieve and sustain 
the 60% threshold?

If they do, then to what purpose? Why should players who are 
unable/unwilling to meet the requirements for 'good-standing' not be 
encouraged to find more  appropriate guilds?  (And I'm not talking 
about... "I had to take a week off and go camping.." situations... I'm 
talking about consistently missing 60% attendance.) Aren't the good 
standing members just profitting from the rest? This strikes me as an 
offensive policy.

If they don't then great, they aren't actively seeking to benefit from 
someone elses unrewarded labour. Its still not a guild I'd fit into, but 
its not a guild that I find offensive either.
