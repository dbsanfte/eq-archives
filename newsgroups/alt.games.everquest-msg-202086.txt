The reason I quit EQ when Luclin came
out was I upgraded to Win XP and with a sound blaster live card, the midi
music became very distorted.

weird I run XP (pro) and a soundblaster live (5.1) card - and I have no
trouble at all with the music - don't know about the mp3 question but as I
say I have luclin, I have pop, I have velious, kunark, and classic - only
one I don't have is the froggie one - yeshka??? something like that

anyways I have no sound problems at all
