I'd expect it to be playable but difficult.  When my delay is around
250ms I'm fine, at 1500 it's terrible.  I'd suggest doing a few tests
with a modem, because you have a good chance of having less lantency
(though less bandwidth) than with satellite.

We do two normally on a modem, and have few problems, though we
occasionally get disconnected while zoning at the same time.  Tried 3
and it was noticably worse, barely playable.  Hmm, you might end up with
satellite and a modem, or several modems.  

Your ISP can make a big difference.  Try several different ones if you
can.
