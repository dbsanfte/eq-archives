Ack, well, so far I haven't seen any rangers replying, and a smattering of
misinformation to boot.  That's supposed to be *my* job (spreading
misinformation), but now I have to go and correct people, pfft.

I recall that the haste is 1/3rd of the weight reduction.

yes

In my 60 levels, I have not seen two arrows shoot at the same time, so I'd
have to say no.

Someone said that rangers only get archery crits once they have AAs. Not
true.  I have 0 AAs and I get archery crits.  The limitation is that you
don't get crits until...gah, help me other rangers...50? 55? I don't
remember when you start to crit. It is melee crits that I cannot get until
I have Combat Fury.

I also believe this is why rangers like Dextery...increases the chance for
a crit.  (It could be there are other archery benefits that I have
forgotten.)

I am not an archer myself though...I try to follow what my class does with
archery, but I prefer meleeing.  

I'm not sure what you mean by a 40 ranger beating a 40 warrior, and I
can't speak of calculations, sorry.

someone with far more personal experience than I will answer this better,
but this is what I understand to be true.  You get double the damage
against stationary non-rooted mobs.  So there is your "discount" on damage
if you root it...half the damage.  Insofar as your damage otherwise, I
honestly don't know if you do more or less when it is snared, not snared,
etc.  I assume it's the same as melee damage.

Honestly, it's all about you, your gear, and your friends.  If you don't
make an effort to be a tanking ranger, then you probaby never will
be, because Verant doesn't hand it to us.

I'm tanking in a Teir 1 duo right now with a shaman, and he doesn't even
have to use his 2k heal on me...one stoicism per mob works just fine.  I
have tanked mobs that double for 470 with the same shaman, and 35k mobs
that quad for 250 (all in this duo).  (Oh, and can't forget Lodi :D )  I
am never without a slower, though, and I've put a lot of work into my HP
and AC.

My goal is tanking in Teir 2, which is feasible with AA and more gear
upgrades.

I don't believe so, no.  If anyone has found a way, you could find out by
posting at http://forums.interealms.com/ranger
