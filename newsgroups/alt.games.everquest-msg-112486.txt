Umbrous Toilers in Maidens Eye for some interesting fun, they are social,
and it can be a pain if you get adds.
Wyverns in Cobalt Scar, I have always been able to find enough of them
available for my modest needs.
Anything still dark blue in Dreadlands.  I hate the zone though, so I can't
really recommend it.
Sun Revenants and Reavers in Scarlet Desert.
Raptors in Timorous Deep.
Anything dark blue in Tenebrous Mountains.
Dark blue giants in Eastern Wastes.
Giants in Wakening Lands.

The easiest ones of those were the Wyverns and the Sun Revenants.  The ones
I had the most trouble with were the Umbrous Toilers.
