It usually takes a few more days after that to discover that this
place is really a cesspool. But, as usenet goes, its a cesspool with a
larger ratio of grey water vs black than usual.

First thing you do next time you log in:

/join serverwide.age:age

If the regular creeps in there don't annoy you enough to make you
vomit, add

/autojoin serverwide.age:age

After that any time you want to talk to people from this newsgroup or
ask a question, it's just /1 blah blah blah. Test it out using the
following, best done during European primetime:

/1 Hey Meems monks still tank better than rangers
