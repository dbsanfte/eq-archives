     Exactly.  It seems that if you have more than 2 addictions, as
long as they are not of the drug or alcohol kind, they suddenly turn
into "hobbies" and are considered a good thing.
   I guess you could just bypass the search for the other two 
behavioral addictions and just lay claim to being a "consummate computer
role-playing strategist".  Better than dealing with the headaches of 
being addicted to casual sex or....

Annie <--- so addicted to EQ she can't even think of another fashionably
           popular thing to be addicted to.  Thought of sex right off
