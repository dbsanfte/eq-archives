Mesmerisation cannot take hold if the mob is already mezzed by a necro, bard
or a single target enchanter mez spell. If you use mesmerisation or its
upgrade fascination, you can only refresh mez with the same spell or wait
for the spell to fade in order to land a single target longuer duration mez
spell.

When i was your level, i found that area effect mez spell was very dangerous
for me so i didnt use it : too many resists. But, when you are higher level,
you will find it very useful to stop trains of green or light blue mobs.

As said a lot in this newsgroup, you may consider or not consider that
charisma has an effect on mez resist. I found out myself that it has no
effect at all. I have done a bunch of tests with charisma between 85 and 205
and didnt notice any difference. Sometimes my mez stick better when i forgot
to cast on myself charisma buff ! (

Your level vs the level of the mob and the MR of the mob determine if your
mez lands or not.

During a fan faire, someone asked about influence of charisma : necro and
enchanter have spells which are supposed to be influenced by charisma but
necro have very low charisma ! so what ? Embarrassed answer of Verant :
charisma have a very little influence on resist rates.

Next fan fair, another question : so, does cha have an effect on resist
rates of mez ? Answer : yes it has ! But it depends on the spell and on the
class ! Enchanter SHOULD HAVE more charisma than necro then the class is
also considered for resist bla bla bla .... In fact Verant have to justify
that if all enchanter gear includes cha boost, there is a reason. How many
times have i heard that cha must have an effect on mez cause enchanters
items have cha on it ). Do paladins and SK put points in cha at creation ?
Though its one of their green abilities : they should put points in it cause
it is written in the manual. ;-)

But take care : Verant said that they were working on resist sytem. They
said that enchanters should have high charisma (check eq.castersrealm.com
for fan fair reports). So, we may have some surprises after one of the next
patches.
