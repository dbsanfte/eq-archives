The ancient croc is a broken spawn . One of the mistakes I mentioned . Do
you know why? Its because monks,druids,shamans , and any one wishing to
learn tradeskills using wisdom needs a pair of wisdom legs . The next set of
useable legs is planar .The arms that drop are the same way but for int
casters . That means that this one spawn has to serve 2/3rds of the server
population in the levels 30-50 . Yes that makes it damn crowded here.

Ways to fix it ? Add several more sets of arms and legs level appropriate
for the classes that can use . The 40th level +6 wis legs here , the 40th
level +6 int arms there . Do the same with for 20th level equipment and
voila no more crocidile camped.

Not what you want though . You want the only drop of useable equipment to be
RIGHT THERE and you want the only one who can farm it to be YOU. SMELL OF
PLAT INDEED ! You want items higher levels cannot get but want that you can
get due to your protected farming status. You want to reach into thier
wallet since they have more than you do and that just isnt fair is it . What
took them 3 years to accomplish you want to do in 3 monthes and by god we
can change the rules to make it so can`t we. You just aint satisfied that
the game is 10X easier now its still to hard . wahhh , wahhh.
