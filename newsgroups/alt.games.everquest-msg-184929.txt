If you follow the directions, the maps are installed in your EQ game, so you
don't have to go create them yourself.

The arrow indicates that your sense heading skill is high enough that you
can sense the direction you are facing on the map.  It is explained in the
cartography section of the LoY portion of the EQ site (www.everquest.com).

Cheers,
Eric
