DEX: How quickly you learn weapon skills; how often a weapon will proc; how
quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows. How often
criticals and crippling blows occur for warriors.

STR: Determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average
damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills. Affects
your attack value.

STA: Affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath.

INT: Directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the
amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights.

WIS: Affects the amount of mana the priest(druid, cleric, shaman) classes have,
also rangers and paladins; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills
if your wisdom is higher than your INT.

CHA: Affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how
much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and
enchanter spells (charms in particular)

AGI: Affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult
it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit.


So you want high DEX and INT to learn weapon skills faster.
