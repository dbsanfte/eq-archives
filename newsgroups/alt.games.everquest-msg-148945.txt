My character started off as agnostic and in general i kill mormal or 
evil things and havent bothered with good mobs like guards.
To get new spells that are in neriak i often pay a newbie to get me them 
which is fine but the maybe other times when i need to get into an evil 
city myself for whatever reason.
I was wondering how difficult is is to change from good to evil and back 
again.
Lets use Qeynos guards as an example as these con green to me now at 34.
How many hours of killing queynos guards would be needed to get me 
inside neriak and then how many hours off killing neriak guards(if there 
doable to me, im not sure?) for my alignment to be good enough to get 
inside qeynos again?
