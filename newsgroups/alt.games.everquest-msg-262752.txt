I've talked to a somewhat sizeable number of Christians trying to
determine whether or not the Old Testament laws still applied, or if
Jesus somehow abolished them, or what the deal is.

Some Christians told me the old laws still applied, and presented me
with Biblical proof.  Most Christians told me the old laws no longer
applied, and presented me with Biblical proof.  As far as I can tell,
the Bible is inconsistent with itself on this matter.

The proof that they still apply was some quote from Christ saying the
old laws would not be abolished until both Heaven and Earth passed, or
something to that effect.  I'm pretty sure Earth hasn't passed, at
least.

The proof that they no longer applied was some letter to the Romans, I
think, which seemed to indicate that upon Jesus' ressurection, the old
laws no longer applied, because there was a new convenant.

I'd personally like a downright iron clad solid answer to the question
of whether the Old Testament laws still apply or not.  If they do,
virtually no active Christian in the United States is in compliance.
If they don't, then a lot of Christian attitudes against things like
homosexuality are confusing, since Jesus never addressed homosexuality
as a sin, and thus Christians shouldn't be prejudiced against it, as
far as I can tell.

In the end, I still suspect Christians will interpret the parts of the
Bible they want, the way they want to interpret them, to match their
own desires and predjucices.
