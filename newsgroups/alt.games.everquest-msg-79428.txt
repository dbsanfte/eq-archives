Thank you for posting the magic number stuff so I didn't have to go
look for it.  In one of the other posts in this thread, I did refer to
the 2dam+1, which is another way of writing (dmg x 2) + 1.  I wasn't
sure it was the off-hand magic number, but now that we know it is, I
will use this very post to attempt to beat some sense into
badnewhounddog.

OK, we have two weapons, one is a 10/20, the other is a 20/40.  The
magic number of the first one (assuming level 50, which the other
numbers seem to indicate) is 28, the magic number of the second one is
48.   Right there we can see that there is a significant difference in
the output in the primary hand with the faster weapon, about 14% more
damage over time.  This is a pretty significant difference.

(And remember the moss-covered twig, I'll use it to demonstrate how
much better faster is in primary hand.  It was 3/10.  So magic number
for it is 14.  So every 1 second, it does 14 damage, which is the same
output at 28 every two seconds.  The ratio is nowhere near as good,
but the damage output is the same.  Of coure the damage output is much
better than that of the slowest weapon.)

OK, we have two weapons, one is a 10/20, the other is a 20/40.  The
magic number of the first one is 21 and the magic number of the second
one is 41.  (Now right here there is a 2.4 percent advantage to the
faster weapon, so yeah, it does do a bit more damage, but it's nowhere
NEAR as much of a difference as in the primary hand.  14.2%>2.4%)

Right there I have refuted anything you could say about preferring the
faster weapon in your off-hand.  Between two weapons with the same
ratio, the off-hand will produce slightly more damage with the faster
weapon.  However, the primary hand receives a MUCH larger bonus, an
almost 6 times (2.4X6=14.4) larger bonus, with the faster weapon.  

(Remember the moss covered twig, with a magic number of 7, it's not
putting out anywhere near the output of the other two.  It gives 7
every second, vs 21 every 2 and 41 every 4.)
Now before you get all indignant and say, "But what about the fact
that you can swing more times with the faster weapon?" let me explain
that you really can't.  Say the fight lasts 60 seconds, the fast
weapon has 30 chances to possibly attack, the second weapon has 15
chances.  To make things simpler, I'm gonna just use 40% instead of
41.6% as the percentage of dual-wields you get.  So the first weapon
is successful 12 times, and the second is successful 6 times.  You are
starting to see a pattern here, I hope.  You work out the numbers
(lets see, 12 x 80% x 21=201.6 and 6 x 80% x 41=196.8) you'll find
that you do 2.4% more with the faster weapon, we showed that above.  
Ahhh, but what if the fight only lasted 58 seconds?  Well, the faster
weapon will never have more than 1 more cycle to attack (if the ratio
between the two weapons is 2:1, one more attack; 3:1, two more
attacks; 4:1 three more attacks; etc), so we'll assume that you can do
one more magic number of damage, which in this case is 40% of 80% of
the magic number, or about 7 damage....but remember, if you put it in
the primary hand, it still gets that extra attack cycle, which does
more damage because it has a higher magic number AND it's 100% to go
off vs 40%.

(Remember the moss covered twig, with a magic number of 7, it's not
putting out anywhere near the output of the other two.  It gives 7
every second, vs 21 every 2 and 41 every 4.)

Given two weapons of equal ratio ALWAY put the fastest in the primary
hand.  Given two weapons of roughly equal ratios, ALWAYS put the
fastest in the primary hand.  Ratio matter much more for off-hand.
