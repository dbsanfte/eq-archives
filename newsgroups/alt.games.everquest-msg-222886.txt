Through Jaggedpine.  You can either go to that zoneline looking arch just
east past the river or just click on the pedestal in the humans village that
used to zone you back to Jaggedpine (grr).  I've heard the critters are low
40's but they are all green to me at 62 so I cant say exactly from personal
experience.  I dont think this zone is intended for xp tho.  Believe it will
be the jumping off zone for the next expansion lands to the west.  Supposed
to be a war or something.  Also Morden Rasp is building a ship and may need
some help.  Could be some tradeskills quests Im guessing.  Nothing yet
though.
