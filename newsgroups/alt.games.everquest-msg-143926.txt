It's got to be level 40 or higher to get experience grouped with a
level 60, but I found that grouping with a level 41 cleric in Grimling
Forest while I was hunting for acrylia drops made the process go much
faster for my level 60 rogue than bind wounds and invigorate would
have done. Plus, the cleric went from 41 to 51 in just under a week.
With a shaman as well, I would have gone to Tenebrous Mountains or
Scarlet Desert where shaman slow and haste alone would have made the
fighting a lot easier and where you can get decent XP even as high as
level 60.

I just have you accidentally killfiled.
