Hell man, I'm looking to kit my doggie out pimp style! =) I'm gonna
try giving him something for every slot (even if it's just a 1ac ring
from a dervish) I want to see how much an improvement that'll be. I
think it'll be huge, because just dropping two hands if Ixblat (sp?)
makes a huge difference, and I dropped some tattered armor I made on
him, and the damage reduction was noticable (just a few percent, but
still noticable).
