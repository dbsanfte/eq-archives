I have been having trouble with the game getting so choppy as to be
not playable after being on more than an hour or so.  But since the
last set of patches that problem seems to have been fixed.  I know
some other people were having the same or similar trouble.  Did
anyone else get this pleasant surprise?  It has gotten so much
better I can have  some of the eye candy on and it runs smooth as
silk in all but major raid situations.  Going to try to use the new
models later to see how that goes.

/em crosses his fingers.
