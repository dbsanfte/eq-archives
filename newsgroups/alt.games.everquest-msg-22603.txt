Probably using the wrong fish.
Fish Rolls require 'fresh fish' only (ie: the generic fish).
Fish Fillets can use any number of different fish types (including
fresh fish, the Thunder Salmon (from the Karanas), the Highland Pike
(from Highpass), and many others).
I do NOT know if the Pine Cichlids out of Surefall can be made into
filets though... judging by your results above, most likely not.
(Who'd want a cichlid filet anyway? =))

The basis of the response: You need different fish.
