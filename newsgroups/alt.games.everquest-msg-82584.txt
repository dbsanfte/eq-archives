There have been some good answers so far, but all are moderately
confusing (not the fault of the authors, the subject itself
is confusing).

Let's see if I can simplify (wish me luck):

When you buy an Everquest box, you're in a sense not buying the
software, you're buying a key to create a gameplay account.

You may incidentally need to install the software in the
box in order to get online and create your account initially
and then play on it, but in fact you could just stuff the
box in the closet and create an account by submitting the
account key on *any* computer *anywhere* that has 
Everquest already installed on it.

Accounts do not "belong" to any particular computer.  You're
not installing the account on the computer you used to create
the account, instead you're using that computer to access
Verant's servers, and create a new account for yourself
*on their servers*.

Once you do that, you can sit down at any computer in the
world that has Everquest installed on it and log into your
account and play.  A computer with Everquest installed is
just a portal to reach your account on the central
Verant servers online.

You're also welcome to take your EQ CDs and install the
software on as many computers as you can get your hands on,
so that you can play from any location you happen to be at,
and/or invite a dozen of your friends over to play EQ
together (presuming they all have their own accounts to
log into).

However, any given account can only be played on by one
person at one time.  Try two and you'll get an "already
logged in" message on the second attempt.

Now, if the members of your family all want to play
simultaneously (and that can be a hell of a lot of fun),
you'll need to buy one Everquest box for each person,
because that's the only way to buy multiple accounts.

Buy four EQ boxes, install one on all computers, then
use the four different account keys that came with the
four boxes to create four accounts, one after the other
(from any computer, even all from the same computer
if you wish).  Then run any account from any computer
as convenient.

Or, if people don't mind taking turns, you can create
four separate play characters on the same single account
(you can create up to eight characters on a given server
on a single account, and eight more on the next server,
etc.)  HOWEVER, be aware that this violates the license
agreement you click "I Accept" to every time you play the
game -- it insists that each account be owned and operated
by only one person, period, and not shared.  I don't
recommend violating it, personally.  Some people think this
is just Verant's way of making people buy more boxes, but
there's an excellent practical reason for it -- it prevents
a *lot* of headaches for their customer service department,
since they don't have to deal with people saying, "my
brother messed up my character, can you fix it?", or
"no, that wasn't me shouting obscenities to the zone,
that was my stupid sister, how can you hold me accountable
for that?"  Etc.
