The only way you will find a good source of Yew leaves is to cheat and use
Showeq. They are a Random location ground spawn that will spawn in trees
under rocks. The only time my Bard was able to find them was right after
patch. I wrote down locations of all the ones I found never found a second
in or close to that location. After about 100 hours and finding a total of
20-25 I gave up on making BP Armor. I wish you the best of luck.
