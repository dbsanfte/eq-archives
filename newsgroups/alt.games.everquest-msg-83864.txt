    Try a hunt day in Efreeti in Sol B, with the odd trip out to clear the
Fire Giants. You should come out with some neat saleables, and a fair pile
of Lava Rocks. Not to mention a great heaping chunk of XP from clearing the
Imps/Lava Guardians in Efreeti. VERY doable in a single group at your level,
just have crowd control along.
