The fact that it COULD happen is sufficient from a military

I agree.  

It just happens that, in THIS case, both happen to be true.

It also depends on what YOU are arguing.  If I recall correctly, you
(or someone in this particular tangent) was not a legitimate target.

I made the claim that the USS Liberty WAS a legitimate target. And
backed that claim up with facts.

I also make the claim that the ATTACK on the legitimate target was
also understandable. I base this on my military experience.

That would be a violation of the "rules" of war.

And I agree with you on this point.  As I have stated.

No it does not. As I have stated.  You are preaching to the choir on
that point.

But that doesn't change the overall issue that the attack on the
Liberty was NOT terrorism, nor is it justification for the
Palestinians terrorism...

As much as I hate to parrot Loopy here, (and I *KNOW* I am gonna pay
for this!  hehehehe) from a military point of view during war time,
the logic of the attack is self-evident.

Not expediency, but rather sound military stragety and tactics.

I have already conceded that the strafing of survivors in the water
(if this indeed happened) is NOT justified.

But that does not change the fact that, from a military point of view,
a military in war-time, the attack itself was justified.

Again, IF the survivors were strafed in the water intentionally, then
I would agree with you.

But the initial attack itself was not..

No, you can't justify them..

But you can understand them...

OK, you seem to be concentrating on ONE aspect of the attack and using
that to paint the entire attack..

That is an error on your part...

FOr the sake of the argument, let's say the Russians WERE warned and
refused to leave...

Ignoring the aftermath of the attack, would the ATTACK itself be
justified??

Depends on the circumstances..

If I had reasonable belief that the Russians were a threat to my men
or my mission, I would probably be given a medal...

One of the things the taught me in Army OCS was initiative...  Well, I
also learned that as an Air Force cop, but the lesson is really
pounded home as an Ell-Tee...
