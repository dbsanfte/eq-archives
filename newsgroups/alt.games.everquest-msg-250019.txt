I am sure its coincidence that the both number 1 items
on each list have the word time in them.  ;)

Visited Maru Seru today with my 23 Enc,not a single
Hopper to find,but who cares for lowbie zones and 
around 10 discontended customers I saw there in 2hours,
all oocing after some minutes entering the zone:
"Where are the mobs?"

Hm,only 354 traders in Bazaar on one of the oldest 
servers(SolRo),maybe mass exodus has already begun.
I see the day coming,they will hide the number of players
in Bazaar,like they did on the serverlist some years ago.  :)
