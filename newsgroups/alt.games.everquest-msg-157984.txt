Thanks for cutting out the context.  I was comparing how both my chars
did on raids.  Nova doesn't get exp, but she gets a bit of extra time
to FD/camp/do SOMETHING to get the hell out of Dodge.  Taellaar gets
the exp while dying when things start going downhill.

Well, from what I've read, I was under the impression that when the
guild leader called for a hasty retreat, I'd want to try and live so I
could camp back in and start summoning corpses.  If I'm wrong well,
then Taellaar and Nova both get to die lots at raids.  I still won't
bitch about losing exp.  One day it'll pay off.  If i don't get exp on
Friday's raid, well, there's always Saturday to go do something else.
Of course, when I'm not getting exp in a *group*, I'll have a few
things to say.

If he ever gets there.  It's way way WAY easier to level Nova than it
is Taellaar.  What I find interesting is that no matter how often I
say "but I have a NECRO", everybody keeps pointing out how I have a
rogue, therefore I can't talk.  Nova's 31 now.  When she passes
Taellaar, *then* do I have the right to tell those crying about no exp
to shut the hell up or find a guild that doesn't bother organizing
raids for it's members?
