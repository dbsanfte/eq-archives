But increasing the raids DPS giving a higher chance of victory IS important,
no?

The only times I've had SoS is when we have 1 chanter at a raid, they died
doing a tash pull, and then in typical fashion VoG fades.  Even then, only
if its what id consider a "tough" mob (cursed, aow etc)

We only had 1/2 enchanters for most of yesterdays raid (actually for most
raids),  probably never more than 5 on a raid, but VoG is simply THAT much
better.  And in fights where DPS is oh so crucial, I cant see vog ever being
refused.

Doesnt VoG last a shitload longer than SoS too, meaning less buffs for the
chanter.

Actually I forgot about some ranger stuff I read in the past, comparing the
ranger epic with other high end weapons (render etc) and iirc, somebody in
FoH actually said the epic would outdamage it.

As for the 40haste, thats easily replaced and not at all what would make it
a truly valuable weapon, imo
