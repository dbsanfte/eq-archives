Fair enough. Question them to your hearts content :)

I contend that as an automaton cannot make a choice there is no
possibility for the automaton to choose good or evil or involvement or
apathy...

Meaning = consequence = significance

consequence is a particularly good synonym. Because it highlights what
I'm looking for: a life with meaning is a life with consequence. It is
impossible for an automaton to have consequence, it is merely a cog.
It contributes no consequences of its own. To have free will gives one
the ability to have a life of consequence. To literally affect the
universe in some way, of ones own accord.

>That it may have been pre-ordained by 
>causality does not really change anything.

It changes everything. Without free will individual actions have no
significance, except as a reflection of the initial state of the
universe. The greatest human achievements of thought, science, and art
are of no greater consequence than our least accomplishments... that
is to say of no consequence at all.
