Sounds like it was reset to the original Befallen. They did this once
before, left it for 3 - 4 days, then put it back to the new Befallen.

Word of Advise: if you don't have them already, get two copies of the first
and second keys. From what I hear the mobs that hold the keys don't appear
as regularly in the new Befallen. Keep one set on you, and put the other set
in the bank. That way if you die behind a locked door, you don't have to
wait for someone else to open it. Just go to the bank, get out your spare
keys, and retrieve your corpse.
