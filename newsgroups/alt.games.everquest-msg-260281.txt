The idea of camping mobs for drops was a player invention, not part of
the Vision. They never thought people would be so desperate to get a
measley little boost to a stat to do what people like yourself
apparently thought was the entire point of the game.


>And did you really like staring in your spellbook for 34 levels ?

Classic strawman fallacy. He didn't say everything was better, only
that the whole was more satisfying in "a lot of ways". Most people,
other than one or two people who have to be classified as "weirdos",
have mentioned the spellbook was an idea that simply didn't work.


>Mouse input for numerical values was fun too.

That had nothing to do with the Vision and was simply a UI failure.
