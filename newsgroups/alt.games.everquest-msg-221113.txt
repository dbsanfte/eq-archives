Id have to disagree.... My 61 beast, with decent gear (read sub NToV /
HoT), can pull aggro off of almost any warrior within my level
range...  This is not activly trying to pull aggro either.  This is
using my spell set and pet to do standard damage in any group.  The
only warriors able to "Hold" aggro have very high level gear (read
weapons)...  Now, put an SK or Pally in thier place, and they hold
aggro with minimal attention to it.

Warrior aggro problem is that they have issues holding it unless gear
is over the top, and a sub par equiped knight is able to hold aggro
with primarly spells.
