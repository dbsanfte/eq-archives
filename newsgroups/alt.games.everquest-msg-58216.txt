All i tried to do was reinforce my view, and show I was speaking from a
healer background (in relation to cheal/celest heal) and in agro terms - in
terms of who could and couldn't hold agro from my 60 monk.

Level for level a monk can't tank better then a pali/SK/warrior, before all
3 have much more hitpoints (assuming higher level, and using cheals for mana
efficiency)

Your next point is partially my response

with a warrior being main tank giving

The warrior will have more HP/AC and most likely do more damage.. my point
is though, an SK gets the job done just fine in places like Sebilis.  Maybe
the Warrior is a better MA, but the SK is still *good enough* whilst
bringing extra abilities to the group - snaring, stealing a mobs AC/STR,
dots, fd pulling if a monk isnt present.

> (ever noticed how hard it is to cast when getting beat on?)

IMO, At 45+ (especially 50+) it becomes much easier to channel through a
mobs melee.  of course they can interrupt, and you can't melee while your
casting.

See where was the need for that?

My SK was originally made because a group of us in the guild were from the
same country, and organised a playing group each week.. we decided to make
evil races to see what we could achieve - which is why I made mine a troll.
Looking back, of troll and ogre I wish I had made an ogre if nothing else,
for the extra STA and STR.. I don't know how the "weaker" classes find it as
tanks (e.g. dark elf warrior, high elf paladin, edurite SK) but my INT sucks
(only 110 or so - i am not a massive twink by any means) and being an
erudite, the Int would be way way higher

>Look for some flayed skin armour, looks good (well a full suit >on a human

What server you on?  I had some of this stuff on my monk from his karnors
days.. never tried to sell it, its just been sat around doing nothing. If he
never destroyed it, if your on prexus your welcome to it.
