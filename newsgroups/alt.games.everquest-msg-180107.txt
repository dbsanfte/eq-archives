So Genesis 6:14 according to Michael wasn't God telling Noah to make an ark.
Also Genesis 3:23 wasn't God banishing Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden
according to Michael.
Also according to Michael Exodus 20:3-17 isn't God giving Moses the
Commandments.
This Michael person says these three things were made up by some Goddess
cult.
God Bless
