The conspiracy theorists are few and far between.  I know that Dan Day has
little or no respect for Verant and/or their customer service personnel, and
he's not alone. Hell, personally I think most are probably nice in real life
but they just don't THINK.

Bottom line, don't do stuff that you know is wrong and you should never have
a problem with a GM.   Quite honestly they have more important stuff to do
(or at least a lot of minor stuff) than eyeing someone not petitioned.

If I understand the Conquest thing correctly, the GM's story is that
Conquest made it so that the critter would hate the cleric the most...and
there was no way for the critter to get to the cleric.  EVERYONE who is over
level 50 knows that this would be an exploit.  Whether this is the action of
a bunch of assholes in a guild or a rogue GM has no affect on you, the
average player.
