don't and Can't are conjuctions.

thru, is a phonetic equivalent.

plane, phone, bus, car, Ad, Auto, Admin, Sysop, Sysadmin, etc ARE NOT
Abbreviations  and originally(when they were abbreviations) had no place
in written communication.

Abbreviations are used in written communication, to facilitate brevity. 
Hence the broad dislike towards the non-standard abbreviations.  AN
abbreviation Cannot and should not be pronounced.  It is a written
symbol &=And %=Percent etc.

I gave examples for what I meant. You convieniently snipped them.
