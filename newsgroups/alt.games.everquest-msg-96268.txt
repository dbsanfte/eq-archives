Bah, don't worry about the JBoots, just buy SoW potions, since you get a 
2.5 minute version of Selos at 49.

Yeah, bards solo remarkably well for a group character.  Depending on 
level they can fear-kite (though I would sing your best Jonathan's rather 
than Pixie Strike), charm-kite, or chant-kite.  The thing to remember is 
always start running at the first hint of trouble.  You can get a bit of 
distance and determine if you are in over your head or just got a couple 
unlucky resists.  Being able to mez the mob and heal yourself gives you a 
HUGE advantage while soloing.

To answer the original question, the best place to find hints about all 
things bardic is www.eqdiva.com.  Kocho knows her stuff, and bards love to 
talk and share tips.
