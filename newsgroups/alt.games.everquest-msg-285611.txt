I was not thinking so much in terms of derailing it, but more as being
the last one standing and having the pleasure of watching an entire
zone get smushed.  It's truly fun for me to watch absolute havoc ensue
when 28 people are sitting around the zoneline and a train roles in.
I laugh out loud whenever it happened (I have not seen a good train in
years now).

Btw, that comment was about EQ not WoW.  EQ classes are far too
identical and each can do almost everything.  If you were not so hell
bent on rebutting everything I said you would have noticed the
context.

My information about WoW is not first hand, I admit.  But I also do
not need to go to prison to know whether or not it sucks.  I am more
than happy to accept other people's reports on it.  Point is, you can
know stuff without necessarily experiencing it first hand.

To that end, I have conversation with the ex-EQ'ers I know that are
now playing WoW.  In some cases they like it, in some they do not.
One such person did indeed go from 1 to 60 in 4 weeks and was bored.
He said even the levelling was boring.  Sure, that's an isolated
reference, but gather enough and it becomes a pattern rather than a
data point.
Not all say this.  Some very much enjoy it.  But there is a recurring
theme that it is very easy and, yes it is said again, a dumbed down
version of EQ.  Meaning the original EQ of old, not today's EQ that I
was complaining about in my own rant.  Now *that* EQ does not appeal
to everyone, obviously 5+M WoW subscribers makes that statement, but
the same is said of Mac v. Windows (cockroaches, etc...).
I make this reference for your comment about "no brave people in WoW".
To say there are *none* would be false of course, to say there are
alot would also.

It is interesting and saddening that that one sentence is what people
fixate on and not the rest of the content of the post.  People seem to
get their dander all lathered up about WoW, much like the Mac users
when compared to Windows.

But whatever.
