Well, maybe you are right. Maybe you had some bad luck. True, "safer" is not
the main reason I like to group. But I died a lot of times just because I
did not have a little backup. Then again, I also died because of too much
DoT'ing and lack of SoW :) When pet says "Taunting Attacker Master" dont
belive it ....
