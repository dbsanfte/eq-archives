The big danger is Woushi, although on many servers, Woushi gets killed very
quickly.  I've never seen him.

Note that if you are heading for Kael, and Woushi is not up, it is pretty
safe to port to WL, and then use your spell that goes to the zone "safe
spot", which is just outside Kael.  Aside from Woushi, I don't think there's
anything dangerous at the port circle, and unless someone has trained things
to Kael, there's nothing dangerous between the safe spot and the Kael
entrance.

EJ is fine if you don't get lost.  There are a lot of wandering mobs that
are hard to see because of the jungle, so it is easy to pick up a train, but
most of them are slower than your SoW (all except the raptors and tigers, I
believe, are slow than jboots...don't know what level SoW those guys run
at).  TT zone is easy to reach to clear aggro--just head south or southeast
till you reach the zone wall, and then east to TT zone.

If you are porting to EJ to head toward FoB, on the other hand, make sure
you are levitating before you port.  Then head west, and go up the steep
hill.  If you don't pick up anything on the way, the flat area on the top of
the hill has good visibility and not many wandering mobs, so you should be
able to find the FoB entrance.

(Note: I'm going from memory of where the Druid port goes.  I'm a Wizard,
and so my EJ port goes to a different place than yours.  I *think* your port
is fairly near mine).

For CS, I don't think there is *normally* anything at the port that would
bother you.  However, people kite wyverns around, and go quite near the port
circle, so it could indeed be a dangerous port if you don't have good CS
faction.  Getting good CS faction is easy: join a couple of Kael raids that
go in toward the Arena.
