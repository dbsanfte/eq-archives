The current version of the system can't, but I should hope we don't stop
there.  I've never seen such negativity of the possiblity of accomplishing
an engineering goal.  We've gone from room-sized mainframes to laptop
computers so small that I can't use their keyboard without cramping up, and
yet we think a missle defence program is out of reach?  It's almost like we
don't want it to work.

What we've got here is a five-foot hole in our wall, and a ten-foot one.
Well, while we're looking for something to patch up the ten-foot hole, why
don't we get the five-foot one shored up?
