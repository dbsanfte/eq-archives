Pages are random drop off pretty much any mob, any where.  Hunt
mobs appropriate to your level and you'll see pages, runes, and words
that are used to research spells for your level for the various pure casters.
As it happens, you can research a LOT of spells, even though you can
buy many of those spells from vendors.  This means that any given
research component drop has only a one in four chance of being
actually needed by someone, and further only a one in four chance
of being needed for your class, if you happen to be a pure caster.  Since
further most people aren't playing pure casters at all, most people just
destroy the pesky things or sell them to vendors ( where they can fetch
a pp or two, and they don't weigh much )

Your best chance of getting components is to get in a full group with
noone of your class in it, and make  a point of mentioning that you
need research components when they drop (pages in this case)  This
way you will see (assuming a decent group) five or six times as many
dead mobs, five or six times as many pages, of which you will almost
certainly get all.
