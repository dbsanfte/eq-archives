If you can get illusion cast on you to make you only Dubious to the
Crusaders, then you can do the scorpion pincer? quest.  Whatever it is that
is no drop that you loot off of scorps and large scorps in field of bone.  i
can't remember what they are.  Don't mix the ones from regular scorps with
the ones from large scorps though, but they both work in groups of 4 when
given to Warlord Zyz or whatever his name is.  He stands on the 2nd story
balcony in a building overlooking the path near the entrance to cab.  This
quest will greatly improve your faction with the Crusaders.  That's harder
than raising faction with the troopers.  don't give up on the BC quest,
it'll work.  that and slaughtering Iksar Pariahs, Exiles, Manslayers,
....well, you get the idea.

Best of luck.  I've seen it done many times.
