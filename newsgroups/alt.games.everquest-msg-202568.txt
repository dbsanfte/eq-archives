It works out the same really.  It in essence gives an additional 20% 
bonus for adding the 6th member.  They would have gotten essentially the 
same effect by making the group bonus for 6 players 116% instead of 80%.

Example:

Mob gives 200xp
add 80% bonus, giving 200+160=360xp

in a 5 person group all equal level, each player would get 360/5=72xp

in a 6 person group all equal level, each player still gets 72xp, which 
means the mob gives 6x72=432xp.

(432-200)/200=1.16 or 116%.

So, although it is kind of silly to implement it the way they explained 
it, rather than just upping the bonus for 6 people, it works out the 
same.
