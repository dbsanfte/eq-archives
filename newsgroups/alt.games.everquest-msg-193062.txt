I've done both many times, never died in NK, died 3x in Oasis.  You are
more likely to get agro in NK, in my experience, but agro is more likely
to be lethal in Oasis.  Exception would be without SoW.  If SoW is not
available use Oasis, in Oasis SoW doesn't really have much to do with
survival compared to paying attention (Gate can save you from a ghoul
tho, if you are a caster have Gate mem'd and ready).  In NK the
frequency of roaming mobs and number of the roamers that you cannot
outrun without SoW is higher, while the number of mobs that can catch
and kill you even if you have SoW is nearly zero.  In Oasis you have
ghouls which proc ghoulroot and madmen which cast Druid spells including
root, plus Cazel who will kill most any sub-20 char instantly.
