I've been trying my hand at both fletching and tailoring but I think
i'll have to give it a miss. I wouldn't mind making my own arrows but
I really don't want to have bad arthritis when I get old :) (well,
older lol)

Unless i'm doing something wrong what you have to do is buy like 4 x
20 of each component, click on each individual component, backspace
and type to select one, move this piece to the fletching kit, repeat
this three times for the other three components, click on combine,
then move the item to the quiver (or whatever). Repeat all this twenty
times.

I've done it about 5 or 6 times now and it's taken about 25 minutes
each time to makes a few arrows, and an aching wrist. Am I doing
something wrong or is this how your supposed to do it ?
