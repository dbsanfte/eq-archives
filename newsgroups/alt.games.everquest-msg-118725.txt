I understand the low end game very well. I play pretty poorly and switch
characters often, resulting in nearly 2 years play without getting a single
character above 35. The low end of the game is no mystery to me, the mid
game is a brick wall and it's just now that I am experiencing the high end
game....albiet in a somewhat disasterous manner.
