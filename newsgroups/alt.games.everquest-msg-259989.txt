There's a difference. In EQ2, for example, the mob is "locked" once it is 
attacked by a player, meaning that no other player can attack it or do 
damage, only the person or group engaged with the mob. In WoW, the first 
person to tag the mob gets the exp and loot, but anyone else is free to 
continue attacking it.
