I think the 400,000 subscriber figure is accepted to be pretty close to 
real.  Let's round up and say $4,000,000/month.  It's still not a lot of 
money.

 > That's a lot of money.

No, it's not.  Not for a business with 400,000 customers.

No.  Unless you've personally purchased bandwidth in the several hundred 
megabit/sec range, from a variety of providers, and purchased roughly 1000 
server class machines, in the past year or so, you're talking out your 
ass.

Let's use nice round numbers.  Say 1000 servers (pretty much the consensus 
as to how many required).  Each of those is server-class, probably HP or 
Compaq or similar.  Probably $15-20,000 EACH.  Yep.  So right there we 
have to drop around $20million on server hardware.  Oh, plus the routers 
and switches to keep them all talking, though this is probably in the 
several hundred thousand dollar range, pretty much insignificant compared 
to server costs.
Then you have employees, which includes the 45ish GMs, all the server 
admins (would think at least 40 of them), the developers, the marketing 
folks, the HR folks, etc.  I'm gonna throw out a wild-ass number like 200 
employees, making an average of $50k/year, which translates to a cost of 
about $100k/year each, or $20million/year in employee costs.

All of which have to be paid back.  Sony isn't losing money off of EQ, but 
they're not making that much either.

No, it's exactly like they have to meet a pricepoint.  That pricepoint is 
$9.95/month.  If you don't think they give enough CS at this pricepoint, 
they offer a premium service, with basically 20 times the in-game service 
for only 4 times the monthly cost.

They pushed the envelope.  They got burned a bit.  They have it working.  
I have better performance now than I did before Luclin.  I also have 
basically the minimum system.  I also spend at least 50% of my time on 
largish raids, with 30-50 people present.

Name another DirectX8.1 application.  Now name one that is 1/10th as 
complex as EQ.  Ummmm, we're waiting.

Maybe the reason it took months to figure out is that it was a very 
complex bug.  EQ was the first game to require DX8.1, and probably 
encountered a NUMBER of bugs related to a new graphics subsystem.

Well, by your posting here I get the distinct impression that you have 
little knowledge of what the EQ server environment is like, little 
knowledge of business costs involved in supporting EQ, and little concept 
of the complexity of programming.  You also appear to have never worked in 
a company trying to fix ongoing problems.  I am quite confident that every 
EQ programming meeting does discuss the large and outstanding bugs, but 
sometimes you have to focus on the small gains.  Maybe the gnome sitting 
bug is related to some other larger issue.  Or maybe it was just a tough 
week and that was the only graphics glitch they got completely fixed.
