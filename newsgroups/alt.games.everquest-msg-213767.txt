Still standing by my statement.  :P

At low levels, shamans solo go soooooo slowly.  Even my super-twink shaman
went slow soloing, in spite of wearing a haste item and fungi tunic.  It was
the slowest I've done the 1-20 levels since my very first character.  They
just don't kill fast, don't have much of a mana pool, etc.

Now at later levels, sure.  At 65 I'd put a soloing shaman up against just
about anybody, and really at 35+ they are pretty damn potent soloers.  But
for someone just starting out as a total newbie, they're one of the worst
soloers.
