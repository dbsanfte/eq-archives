When you reach 201 skill, you can bind wounds to 70%.

When this happens depends on where the caps are for your class, both pre and
post 50.   A warrior will reach 201 skill at level 57.  (175 cap before
level 50, then rising 5 points each level after 51.)  For a monk, 200 points
pre 50, and 5 points at 51 gets you there.

Castersrealm still lists shamans as having a post 50 cap of 200, but I
believe this was actually changed a few months ago.


In addition, every class can buy Alternate Advancement levels which allow
you to go up to 30 percent higher.   So those with 200 or less skill can
bind to 80, and those with 201 can bind to 100.
