 I've seen a lot of gnome enchanters on my server. I normally group with
one. But yes, then main race seems to be High Elf from what I've seen.
You'd have to check eq.castersrealm.com. They normally have suggested
races/stats,

 Yes. Please don't powerlevel an Enchanter especially if you're not sure
how to play the class. And the only way to truly learn the class is to
play one to high levels. Enchanters get beat on a bit so you don't want
to be level 50 with a defense of 3. I know I sure wouldn't want to group
with a powerleveled enchanter. Despite what you (Sergey) claim I think
you would be lacking at the higher levels.  That's just my opinion
though. 

 Not to get in this debate again but Shaman is the best at powerleveling
a melee class from what I've experienced. Casters aren't really good at
being powerleveled. If you really insist on PLing the best way to do
this is to have someone start a melee character and you two can
powerlevel together although it would take twice as long.
