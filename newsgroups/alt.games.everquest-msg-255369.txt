I would whole-heartedly agree with you.  Do you think Brad wanted to
build anything less than D&D in a computer?  The problem is computers
can't react outside of their program limits, whereas DM's can.
Players could throw out something completely off the charts and the DM
could (within a few seconds perhaps) come up with a way to incorporate
it, or at least  give you a chance to succeed.  Computers can't do
that, at least not yet.

I think one of the reasons EQ made it so big is because it was the
best and closest implementation of D&D in a computer ever seen.  I
beta'd Meridian59 and I thought it was fairly poor.  Can't remember
why now, that was 7 years ago, but I remember not being enthused.
