Where did you guys get it from? We ordered the CE from Amazon.co.uk and it
still hasn't dispatched! it is meant to be dispatched today at the latest!
this is really starting to wind me up. I'm out almost all of tomorrow, if it
would have arrived today I could have played all day. If you got it from
Game or similar I might try to get a standard copy etc today.
Ceri :o) (sorry for the rant but I just wanna play)
