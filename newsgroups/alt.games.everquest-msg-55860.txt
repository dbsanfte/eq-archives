You sound like you would have really much fun with wood-elf ranger. At first
ofcourse.. I recommend playing a hybrid at first to learn the ropes of both
casters and melees.
I suggest switching to necro, enchater, mage or druid after you have grasped
the concept.
Why? Well... I have played ranger to 35 and now i'm reaaally bored with it
because it plain and straight sucks to solo and you get very often killed in
groups as many people still think rangers can be used as main tanks on that
level...

My primary char is now 28lvl enchanter and i must say it has been the
funniest character i have ever played, and i have levelled every class to
atleast lvl10. (Yeah, ok i'm going to get flamed for that, i know, you can't
really know what a class is like before 20 or so)
 Bard was fun too, but that requires you have flawless connection, have 4
arms and 20 fingers which all have it's own brain to operate instruments and
songs with efficiency :P

I found mage to be very fun too. Necro and druid are on the list because
everyone says they are the best classes to solo, i, myself didn't like
either of them really.
If you are planning to travel alot (do quests, see the world etc.) i suggest
druid because of their cababilities of fast travelling.

And hmm.. Whattahell. Pick whatever you like! Everquest is actually really
well balanced game and i guarantee you will have a blast no matter what
class/race you play!

Now to come think of it, i think i thought myself somewhat superior gamewise
as ranger because i knew i had to work harder to achieve same goals as many
other classes :).
And i know i could still solo yellow (one or two levels higher than you)
monsters even at 35 if i took everything out of my arsenal and really put
thought into it :)

Err.. Ok enough with the rambling. Go play now, Shoo! :)
