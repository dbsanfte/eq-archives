[SNIP]

But you're not okay with this if it means not raising the costs might
drive them to a point where they have to shut EQ down?

*shrug* And, 9 times out of 10, it ISN'T their fault. There are
routers that VI has no control over that all internet traffic through
a specific region passes through which is WHY several people can
experience lag spikes, LDs, etc at the same time. I'd wager even most
of the times that there are huge player drops, it's not something
under their control - but they rez for deaths caused by this anyway.
