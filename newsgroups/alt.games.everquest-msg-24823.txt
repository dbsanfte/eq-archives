I didn't think mobs held the coin you gave them, only items.
Or should I say, when I loaded a Gnoll on elite ledge with items and coin he
only returned the items not the coin when killed.
That was a long while ago now so maybe it's changed. I just drop copper on
the floor now, silver I'll normally trade up at a merchant if I can else
that gets dropped too.
