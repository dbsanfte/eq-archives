I know, that was basically my thought - I wonder how they talk parents 
into that?  I mean, it's not like kids stay distracted by one game for 
long - I'd figure the shelf life of this in most kids' homes would be 
about a month.

Not irritated really, I just... well, I waitress all day and I have to 
be nice to strangers who can be total dickheads to me.  When I get home, 
the last thing I want to do is put up with *anything*.  I get on the 
computer to deal with friends I have something in common with, not 
"omgdid u see teh nu briny speers movie itz soooooo kewl" or 
"a/s/l???" - true, Disney seems to have blocked a lot of the chat I'd 
rather NOT deal with but otoh I don't like the way they did it.  Can't 
complain of course, because it's a game for kids ;p  Anyway, back to the 
point - EQ's good in that you can play a char up quite a few levels and 
slowly get to know the people and guilds around you, finding people you 
have things in common with.  This 'make a friend' thing was the second 
or third thing you HAD to do before you could move on.  I finally ended 
up waiting until someone sent me an offer and then kept ducking in and 
out of buildings and 'zones' until they stopped following me - but then, 
that was the last day of my trial run, so I only got one more quest in 
before I ran out of time.
