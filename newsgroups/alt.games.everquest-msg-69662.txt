Well, I'd say stay away from warriors then as they're a group only
character.
What I would recommend is a druid. They can solo from level 1 to level 60
and
you can get groups easily if you want to group. Druids have it easy for
travelling
also, they can port to everywhere ('cept Luclin). As a druid, you can nuke,
you
can buff, you can heal, you can dot etc.. A very versatile and FUN class.

Very easy in Everquest. You can always correct your mistakes with equipment
later on.

> Is there portal magic or do you have to run everywhere ?

If you are a druid you can port, if you well you gotta run.

> Is the EQ community good and are there a lot of EQ web sites ?

There is lots. I'd suggest eq.castesrealm.com and look up at all the classes
to
pick the one you think you will like the most.

The first 20 levels goes fast.
Lots of awesome dungeons in EQ. Again, visit eq.castersrealm and visit the
links section,
you'll find plenty of websites.
