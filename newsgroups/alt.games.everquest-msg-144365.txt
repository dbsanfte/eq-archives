Exactly. You got it perfectly right. *Because* it affects some groups 
more than others it's more disruptive of the whole.

No doubt, but crimes of that nature, if anything, tend to *unite* 
society and make it more cohesive (and in case you are tempted into an 
easy retort, I don't mean by this that they should be punished with less 
severity).

No. It may affect more people, that doesn't mean it's more disruptive of 
the whole. The social tension is evenly distributed.

> greater number of people, shouldn't it be punished more?

No, for the reasons above.
