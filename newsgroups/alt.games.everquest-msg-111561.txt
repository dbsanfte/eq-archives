Well, I had my first really unpleasant experience in EQ last evening,
and it was related to buffs. I ran my low level Barbarian shaman from
Everfrost to Qeynos (with heart pounding, as I hate dungeons). At the
gate in Qeynos, a lady asked if I was new and I explained that I had
been playing since Dec and yes relatively new. While conversing with
her, apparently I missed a request for a SoW from a lvl 11 Mage. I was
SoW's so I guess he assumed I could SoW in return. I am a level 9, but
have yet to accrue the cash to purchase said spell. I have HQ Bear skins
in my pack, but no buyers.....so far. Said Mage proceeded to name
calling and saying I would have received a nice tip. I explained that I
didn't have the spell and that I was SoW's by a Ranger before running
through the dungeon (Black Burrow?). Single word answer...ASS!

This is my first alt with spells such as this. I also have a level 14
Cleric, but have never experienced circumstances like this. I usually
get polite requests for heals, which I give, and I ALWAYS refuse coin in
return. Now, I will think twice about any buffs to chars I don't know,
thus everyone loses in the long run.
