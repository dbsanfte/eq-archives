Hell levels are an "accident" of programming, the formula for how much exp
you require to level (and lose to die) changes as you increase in levels,
when one of these jumps takes place it causes a hell level.
I did find this info on a site that used ShowEQ to gain the info but I can
no longer find it. I believe I posted a link to hit here once...ahh, deja
news, knew it'd be usefull for something one day.

As everyone has said, 30, 35, 40, 45 are the big ones to look for,
50...isn't (prolly coz when the code was written you couldn't level passed
it so there was no reason to change the  multiplier, but 51 is...I have
heard that all the levels passed 51 feel like hell but as others have said,
54 and 59 are considered worse of the bunch)

The figures on this link are out of date in some respects, no data above
50th and the exp penalties for hybrids was lowered but it gives an idea of
how hell levels came about.

Sorry to bring this up but, DAoC has promised to have no hell levels as exp
is on a constant formula...Now it may have been a bug of the programming but
I just feel hell levels actually gave something to the game, when you ding
46 it certainly feels much better than when, say, you dinged 20 (big jump
for a melee, end of damage cap) Oh well, maybe I'm a VAK for liking some of
the little quirks that make EQ the game it is.
Although I fully intend playing DAoC the more I hear about it the more it
sounds like EQ without challenge.
