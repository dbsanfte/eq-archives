I am a lvl 11 Druid  and have this problem with root and snare Thwy won't
stop anything or slow creatures down except me when I goof and caste on
myself. My understanding was that these spell would stop most anything in
their tracks or at least slow them down. Was working on a young kodiak the
ither night and he was joined by several other creatures who were low enough
for me to kill bot left me badly damaged managed to get  snare catse turn
and run (no sow yet )  start casting gate get interupt after interrupt,Bear
on top of me caste snare agin says his feet are entwined bear no stop am
dead can't get afrenought to caste gate, Tried starting it on the run and
stopping half way through as not to interrupt it no good. What am I doing
wrong o is it just because I am too low lvl to snare blue and yellows ??
