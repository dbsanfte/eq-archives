No idea but I noticed her around same time as I noticed a new half elf
guy in velious armor (I think she is in velious armor too, right?) in
the east freeport sewers. he was blue con to a level 37 (similar..
eh?) and his name was like Thiryn Dernus. My druid got on and killed
him (she is less faction challenged than my DEF cleric 37 is..) and he
was no faction dropped no drop lore:

Thiryn Dernus' Ledger

Looks like a bard mail or note from Gixx type graphic (does not open
when right click to read)

He also had no faction. Goods without invis can even get him because
every so often he takes a secret wall out of the east freep sewer and
runs around the perimiter of that slums area.

Hmm perhaps all these new mobs in various old world places drop no
drop things all for a quest? Possibly its the same quest or each is a
quest or part of a larger quest.

Another odd thing is nek woods now is a Golem who is brown colored and
factionless and was immediately out of place with the normal stone and
iron type amiable to dark elves. Hmm in fact it may have just been a
PH for her when I saw it.

I think I'll collect all drops from similar new mobs that I find in
various zones.
