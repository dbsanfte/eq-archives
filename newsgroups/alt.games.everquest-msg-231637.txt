The first impression one would tend to get from learning someone
devoutly studies the bible would be that they are a religious person
who follows its teachings.

What doesn't make sense about it? The secrets of necromancy are, for
the most part, kept among religious followers of dark gods. The only
organized schools of necromancy would be run by them as well. They'd
likely go as far as to hunt down and eradicate any "agnostic" schools
that anyone attempted to start if/when they learned of them.

4.5 years of playing EQ has taught me that Primus strategy guides were
all but useless... Show me somewhere that ***SOE*** or, before them,
***VERANT*** said this.
