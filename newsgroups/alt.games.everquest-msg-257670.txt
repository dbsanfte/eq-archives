Actually, yes.  I've seen a friend who was a cleric in an uberguild deal
with pizza delivery in the middle of a major raid battle.  I've seen other
people deal with kids, make dinner, and stuff like that while playing.  So,
if the player can keep up their group/raid duties while dealing with all
kinds of RL situations, its not that farfetched that the character can sit
down and meditate during a battle.
