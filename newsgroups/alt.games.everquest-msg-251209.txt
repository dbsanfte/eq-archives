Everytime I tried aggro-kiting with my magician, I failed horribly.  No
snare (and no hitpoints to speak of) means I have to make *sure* I don't get
hit, but proximity = aggro, so once I was a certain distance away the mob
would turn on my pet no matter what.

I'm sure there are places it would work.  And in some duos it works great. 
But I just never could get it to work right solo as a magician.
