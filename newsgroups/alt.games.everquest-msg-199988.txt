You said "trilogy" right? That means you have the original 1998
engine. You need the Luclin expansion to get the new engine, with all
thise mods you mentioned.

Think 1998 when playing the original versions and deciding if it's any
good.

How good would UO be without any of the expansions or improvements?
Just the original engine they put out half a decade ago. Would you
declare it to suck by today's standards?
