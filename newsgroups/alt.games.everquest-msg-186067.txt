OTOH ... I took a small group into both Runnyeye and Befallen this weekend.
We had the run of the place both times.

Befallen used to be one of those places where you zoned in and asked who was
keeping the lists ... we were the only folks there.

Runnyeye was great ... until some 53rd lvl bard showed up to use the place
to PL his damn frog.

Befallen was a blast.  We had a lvl 12 chanter (myself), and lvl 12 SK, and
a lvl 12 cleric.  Getting the splintered key was a challenge for the three
of us at that lvl ... a challenge made nicer by the knowledge that we
weren't going to get run over by 4 other groups trying to get the SK.

Soooo .... Yes!  Everyone head to Paludal as quickly as the
books/spires/druids/wizards can take you!  Grind it out there like everyone
else!

Nothing to see in Befallen ... move along. :-)
