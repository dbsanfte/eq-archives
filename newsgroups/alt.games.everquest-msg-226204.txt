From the shadows, the mysterious noway@jose.com (Kobe008) (if that IS
his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>I'm a 30 Ranger and have a Lamentation (Dmg 9 Dly 19) and Centi Shortsword 
>(Dmg 12 Dly 25).  Which weapon should I have as primary and which secondary.  
>I had heard somewhere to put the higher dely weapon as primary so I had the 
>Centi SS as primary.  Then while in a group the other day was told to put the 
>Lammy as primary.  How should it be?

In general put the faster weapon in primary (in your case the lammy).
That takes advantage of your damage bonus which only affects the
weapon in the primary hand, not secondary.

There are exceptions, especially if one weapon is of much higher
quality than the other, or you are having aggro issues, but neither
should apply in your case.
