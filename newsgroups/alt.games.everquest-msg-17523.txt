Screen same resolution on makes it so that the display does not change
resolution when you switch between fullscreen mode and the default windowed
mode (switch between them with F10).  If you turn it off, when you hit F10
the display will change resolution. Personally I have it on all the time
because I hate waiting for the resolution change and, especially since I
barely ever go into windowed mode after getting Velious, the small size
doesn't bother me at all.
