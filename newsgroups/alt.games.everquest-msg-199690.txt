The PoP upgrade to ADoI is Iceflame of E'ci, (also an upgrade to Ice Spear
of Solist). ADoI's damage to mana ratio is 4.8 normally; with Iceflame it
goes up to 6.24. Not so terrible :) But you're right, ADoI is more efficient
than Strike of Solusek.

Now THESE are terrible. Well, maybe less than optimal, anyways. I wish
they'd take out the flat 30% resist on these spells.

> Lets not mention the LoY spells.... our mega uber vision buff spell....

Yeah, no real LoY upgrades for wizards. Who got the best LoY spell upgrade
though? I haven't heard of *any* game-changing kick-ass LoY
spell. Naturally, this could be because I am out of touch :)

Well, it's at least partly a mindless rant :)
