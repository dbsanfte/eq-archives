It is a bad system when you compare it to any other MMORPG.  I played UO
before EQ, there was no where near the down time.  I played AO for six
months about a year ago, there was only one time I couldn't get on.  I
played Jumpgate in beta, and even in beta that wasn't as bad as EQ.  AO
is easily as complex as EQ, so your "complex system" argument doesn't
hold.

They are doing something (or a lot of somethings) wrong.  And they just
don't care.
