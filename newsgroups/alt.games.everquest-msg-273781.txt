Wow, and you talk about me not being able to say things based on
reality. A lie through omission is a lie. It was a vital fact that he
knew would have impacted his chances of getting into the guild. He was
allowed into the guild because he omitted the detail that he was the
KSing little gimpoid that they had encountered in the past.

When questioned about his identity, he lied again.

When he finally was backed into a corner, he admitted it, but he lied
and said it was an "accident" when there's no way in hell that it
could have been one...because it happened TWICE and the little
fucktard laughed about it.

Quit floundering, you little puke. You sound like you have some
personal stake in defending the little fucktard's honor.
