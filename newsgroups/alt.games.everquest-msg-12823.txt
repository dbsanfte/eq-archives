Depends on how much money you have. You can generally get a Runed Totem Staff
pretty cheaply (seen them for 25 plat on Xev in Feymart). It's got some decent
stats for a young wizard.  Staff of Writhing will be a bit more pricey, but
nicer stats if you can handle the faction hit.  Don't worry too much about
your weapons, though. In another ten levels or so your melee days will be
over.
