I have recently found a nice xp and cash camp, Neriak Commons.  A monk of
the same level, and I, can pretty well clear out all the guards in the zone,
and the repop is just about timed perfectly to keep going nonstop.  Each and
every guard drops at least one weapon that almost always sells for 10pp,
plus anywhere from 1 to 5 plat.  The monk uses FD and sneak to run to the
bank, sells all the loot to a nearby merchant, splits the loot, and drops
his share in the bank.  At 55, which the monk just recently dinged, the
guards go lt blue unfortunately.  I was walking out of there with over 1k
plat after a few hours, and was getting over one blue an hour of xp in level
53.  I have not been back there yet at level 54, as I need to find a new
partner.  A few levels before that, I found the guards in WFP to be pretty
decent, although not as consistant about the loot drops.  In WFP, I had no
trouble soloing the guards, I have not tried that in Neriak.
