Agreed that something has to be wrong.  
I know a shaman that had to restart her epic 3 times because of
problems. She lost a fight after a turn in and had to start over. She
went LD and lost the no rent item needed for a turn in. After doing
the first part of the quest 3 times, her faction wasn't too high. If
it's something new, they definately need to change the no rent drops
to rent ones.
