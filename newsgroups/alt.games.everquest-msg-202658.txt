    And that will HOPEFULLY mean more time spent by guides and GMs helping
with bug-related issues. I've always thought that the more time Customer
Service spends dealing with the consequences of bad programming, and the
less time they spend dealing with interpersonal issues, the more likely it
is that stuff will get fixed fast. Now, they might just say "petitions are
down, we need fewer CS people now, cut back the staff!" I hope that doesn't
happen.
