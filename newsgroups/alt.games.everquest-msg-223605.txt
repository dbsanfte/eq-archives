That looks about right.  You can get access to some of the elemental 
planes without hitting all of those as I recall, but, it's been a long 
time since I've checked.

So far, I have PoJ, Grummus, and Hedge.  Grummus was a pickup raid.  
Hedge was guild, PoJ was finally done with guildies.  I have attended a 
number of unsuccessful pickup Manaetic Behemoth raids, and my guild is 
nowhere near ready to try that on our own.  We are planning on doing TT 
fairly soon.
