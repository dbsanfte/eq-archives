    You're actually talking 25 or so AC net - the 16 is raw. And if the
things you fight at level 38 hit for 200 a pop AVERAGE, then maybe you
should try hunting somewhere else. ;-)

    I'm a cleric. I can tell who has on HP gear, and who doesn't. I can't
explain it any better than that. As a cleric, I can tell the difference. And
the ones that put on the HP gear live until my heals land, always. Even in
Sebilis.

>And giving up what is in those slots....

    Will never be that important. Mana regain rate is much more important
than raw mana pool size. Especially as the ENCH hits higher levels and gets
ToT, the wonder spell. The JC set does give 50 total MANA, too.

    James, level 57 CLR with 185 WIS and the jewelry listed above.
