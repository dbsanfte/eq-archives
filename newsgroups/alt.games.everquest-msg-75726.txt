>>> How do you think someone figured out those quests for killing corrupt
guards?
Likely by trying it to see what happened. <<<

So they figured out the quest through reverse engineering?

Kill the mob for the quest loot ... but how do I know it's quest loot? Well,
it does seem to serve no other real purpose.

I have quest loot ... who do I give it to? How many do I give? Do I give
anything else with this loot?

Sorry, your argument doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Please try again.
