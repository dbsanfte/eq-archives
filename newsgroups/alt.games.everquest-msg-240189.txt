ROLMAO...

If you don't want to play the game by the game's rules go play
something else.

What kind of moron joins a game, discovers that the point of the game
is to start with nothing and accumulate stuff from there... and finds
that really upsetting...

So ... instead of quitting he goes and looks for somebody to sell him
stuff so he can get a jump on accumulating stuff without actually
playing the game.

In "Starcraft terms":

That would be like starting a game and finding you've got a couple
harvestors, but no base and no armies.... so you start crying.

And rather than start harvesting and building and playing the game you
run over to the internet to see if someone will sell you some units
and some gas.  

20 minutes later and 500 bucks poorer you have all the gas & crystal
you need, maximum tech, and a kick ass base. 

Yay for you you dipshit poser... but that isn't playing starcraft
that's buying a bunch of stuff so that it looks like you played
starcraft.
