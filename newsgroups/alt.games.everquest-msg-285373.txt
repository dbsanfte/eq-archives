An ad for plat on the mapfiend site caught my eye.  I thought it was a
typo so I clicked on the ad to check it out.  It wasn't but I was
intrigued so I started checking out other ads and they were similar.
Plat is dirt-cheap and you can get up to 2 1/2 million (yes that is
million).  It took me 4 years to accumulate 100k and now you can buy it
for $20-$40 bucks.  So how do these sellers get all that plat?  How
does it impact the game? Is everything selling for a jillion plat
because everyone has so much cash?  Am I going to be the only player on
the server running around in newbie armor?  Can I accumulate plat like
these sellers are doing too?  The thought on being a millionaire has
some appeal especially since I'm unlikely to ever achieve that in RL.
I know I could just buy the plat but I'm too cheap to pay real dollars
to be a fake millionaire
