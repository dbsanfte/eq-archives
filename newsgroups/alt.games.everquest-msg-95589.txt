Completely agreed.  I went from level 2 to 5 on my cleric alt hunting
spiderlings for a generous wood elf druid who wanted the silks.  He gave me
15pp a stack.  That's way more than they're worth, I'm sure, but I felt like
I was accomplishing something for myself, and at the same time, helping out
a nice guy.  He buffed me up every time he came to collect a stack, and the
money he paid me for the silks has bought me a full set of leather gear.
It's a good feeling.
