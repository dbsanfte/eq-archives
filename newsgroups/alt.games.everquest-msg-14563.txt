I wouldnt say its the best druid spells. Id reserver that for sow and
ensnare. In fact, using so an ensnare you can achieve much the same result,
by snaring one and kiting the one you want out of range of the snared one.
Still a darn god spell, especially since it is rarely if ever resisted, even
against reds.
Some places you cant get it to work and have to use snare to split them, ie
the aviak towers in SK.
