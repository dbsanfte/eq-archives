Either, as John said, pay for a Necro to summon it, or sneak into The
Hole the correct way and do a /who rog. If you find some level one or
two halfling rogue in there, he's a corpse dragging mule and you might
get them to fetch for you for a fee. 
  That said, how long have you been on and offline since you fell in and
died? That's a level 3 corpse. It poofs in .... what? Thirty minutes of
game time? You were silly to put any expensive items on it. Better move
fast, friend.
