The problem really isn't with the upper level game, then, bur rather
with how you are playing it. Certainly as a druid with limited on-line
time it's easiest to solo, but as you say that can be dull.

It is possible to get into groups for higher level stuff, without the
large time requirements of raids. I'd recommend you look into that
sort of thing.

And barring that, of course, if you prefer the lower level game,
certainly go back to it, with some new character class, and try to go
only to places that you didn't visit much with your main.

The game really is what you make of it.
