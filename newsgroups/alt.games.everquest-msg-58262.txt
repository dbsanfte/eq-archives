The same vendor that carries the rest of the level one spells carries 
Cavorting Bones. In E. Freeport, the vendor's name is Mika Fugas. Though to 
be honest, the level 1 pet is pretty much worthless. You can easily solo to 
level 4 without the pet. In fact, you *should* solo without your pet to 
level 4 since low level mobs have so few HP (level 1 mobs have 16HP) that 
your pet will frequently do more than 50% damamge, which will half the 
amount of exp received for the kill.

See above.

Disease Cloud is only useful for practicing your Conjuration skill before 
level 4. Otherwise, that spell is almost totally worthless. Siphon Strength 
should only be used if you need the extra strength to carry stuff. It's 
useless as a debuffing spell.

Invis vs Undead, Locate Corpse, and Reclaim Energy will be useful for a 
long time, but the rest will either only have limited use (Lifetap is 
upgraded at level 4, the shielding spell at level 8), or no use whatsoever 
(IMHO, the level 1 pet).

As soon as one pet is gone, you can summon another.
