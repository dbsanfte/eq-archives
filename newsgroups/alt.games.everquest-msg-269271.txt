Well, I ran the experiment tonight, twice.  I burned my bar down to
roughly zero (needed to imbue some plains pebbles anyway, so it gave
me an excuse :-), and rigged up a sit/stand hotkey with the right
pauses so it got me as close to 6 seconds as possible, then mashed
away on it, so I managed to sit for only about 2 seconds out of 6,
but almost always at the tick, as verified by seeing how much my
client showed as my mana.  It mostly went up 17, compared to 1 if
it thought I was standing at the tick.  After I'd gotten back to
around 500 mana, I cast a 30-mana spell and -- at the end of the
casting is when it synched -- it showed me dropping more than 200
mana.  So then I shifted my pattern using the same hotkey, but
trying to be standing at each tick, which was a bit easier since
I was standing more than sitting anyway.  I held that rhythm for
a hundred ticks or so, getting mostly one per tick, then cast a
5-mana spell, and watched my mana jump up by over 500, landing at
1100+.

So I guess all that dancing is just so you can feel you're doing
something instead of just watching the numbers go by. :-)
