Wow, I wish I could run into more of those clerics.  I always donate for a
rez, and so far, only twice has it been refused.  I never go out looking for
Clarity, it's nice, but I don't need it that much, so I don't have the issue
of whether or not to donate for it.  If someone casts it on me out of the
blue, I thank them, and ask if they want a sow.  If I see a friend nearby, I
will ask them, but I don't ask strangers for it.
