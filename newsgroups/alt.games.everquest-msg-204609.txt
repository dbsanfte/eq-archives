You get Infusion of spirit by handing an ethereal parchment to the
beastlord guy in PoK. This is the only way I know of to get it, the way
I got it for my buddy who plays a shaman. The reason I got it for him is
because I wanted him to cast it on me as a sort of 'mini-fos' that
stacks with the cleric self buff line (baotr etc).
