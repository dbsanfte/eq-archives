    That's good. Some cleric class skills have the "increase heals by x%"
ability as a prerequisite, and at this point in time that's damn-near
useless to have.

    Yes, but not in the way you might think. Now, understand that this is
what a cleric understands of the situation - go to a necro board to get all
the details. When you Lifeburn, your health plummets. You get the life back
quickly as a lifetap-DoT sort of deal, like Vexing. However, because it's a
lifetap-DoT sort of deal only one necromancer may Lifeburn until the DoT
effect wears off the mob or else it bounces - no damage, the ability is
wasted. Furthermore, there's some necro DoT (I don't THINK it's Vexing)
which, if this DoT is on the mob, your damage from lifeburn lands but the
DoT effect does not. So since you've just done 4000 damage at once and
you're sitting at 5% health, the mob will low health aggro kill you before
you blink.

    Since it sounds like you'd just be using it to complement Jazz on burn
teams and as a "go out in style" sort of thing, maybe that works for you.
;-) But the first guild necromancer that got it was pretty damned angry that
it killed him every time he used it, since as advertised it's supposed to be
quite survivable.
