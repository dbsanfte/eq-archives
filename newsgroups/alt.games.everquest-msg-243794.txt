Well, there's the rub. A "good" artist is a very subjective term. Personally, I
like Woody's commissions quite a bit. They're more... well... serious-looking
than the comics, in general. I know he's got a backlog right now, but if you've
already been waiting for a while, a little longer wouldn't hurt, right?
