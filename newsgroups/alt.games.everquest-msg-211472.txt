Harmony is similar to the Enchanter/Cleric/Paladin 'Lull' line:
Lull, Sooth, Calm, Pacify, etc...

Harmony lowers the reaction and agro radius of a creature to 15 'feet'

It has an AE range of 40 'feet'.
Can only be used outdoors
Has a level limit (40? never run a druid before...)

The important part is... you want to use it on the other mobs, rather than
the one you want to pull. Also, in general, you will want to pull the
closest mob always as well.
The reason for that is, if you have four mobs in a diamond, you harmony the
front one, then pull the back one, he will likely path right through the
front one. Passing within 15 feet and causing it to assist. (as opposed to
Pacify, which is not AE but has an agro/assist radius of 1 foot,  where I've
walked through pacified giants and had them ignore me).
In general, assist radius is about 50 feet (info coming from a bard forum
with some guy that had way too much time).

Resistance: It is resistible. Not a lot, but it can happen. Also, when it's
resisted, there's a chance that the target will instantly agro on you. That
is (apparently rather heavily) influenced by Charisma. My basis for this
statement is my experience vs. the experience of a guild druid using Harmony
of Nature. At similar levels, I've used pacify and the upgrade Wake of
Trainquality.. er Tranquility (old habits die hard) extensively (several
hundred casts each) and had less than a half dozen resist agros.
My druid friend estimates resist agro at 1 in 4 for him. He has about 120
chr, while I , with no special attention to chr gear, have around 210
(enchanter gear makes you pretty).
Of course it could be a difference in the spells themselves...
