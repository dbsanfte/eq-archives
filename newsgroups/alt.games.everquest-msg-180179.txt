    Martin comes by his cluelessness on rogue gear honestly. Can the same be
said of you and your cluelessness on Martin?

    Actually, the two have near-identical requirements. You melee, you don't
want to be hit, but you likely will at some point. Monks get hit a bit more
than rogues, but it's a similar idea.

    It's the "15 DAM" limit. Your backstab damage scales up linearly with
the DAM on your mainhand piercer. For the longest time, 15 DAM was
considered the "limit" the designers would make. Beyond that, and backstab
damage (which was already capping at doubling for about 550) would have been
nutty. Well, if you can't go beyond 15 DAM, it's very tough to create good
ratio weapons that won't be very powerful in mainhand because of low delay.
The result is a fairly low cap on ratios on droppable rogue-usable piercers.
You can get some non-piercers with nice ratios in offhand, but not piercers.

    Parse what percentage of your damage is backstab damage at level 55,
once you get double backstab. Then you'll know. If you had Primal, you'd
keep that mainhand and Ragebringer offhand for max DPS, but that's mostly
related to keeping Avatar up.

    BoB > chitin - more STR, more HPs, more AC, more resists. DEX doesn't
matter to you given your current weapon setup as you have no procs. I'd also
peg BoB > Fortitude, as the HPs are better on BoB once you cap STA, it gives
better STR and AC, and the two resists you lose on BoB are made up on
Ragebringer anyways.
