True, it is still better than no focus, but less so than before.  When 
soloing, which is my primary use for dots, only the last set of stacked 
dots cast did not run to their full length, so I was getting close to 
maximum efficiency out of the focus effect.  Unfortunately, it does not 
affect my epic dot, but then, it didn't before either.
