When I was a newbie enchanter, I had visions of helping others by Binding
them in cities. A cool ability *unique* to casters! Maybe grateful clients
would donate toward my spell fund, but that wasn't as important to me. I
was *useful*! Then the Soulbinders showed up. Oh well. I still get requests
for it, but not many.  Now it's just folks in HHK. Or the NK gypsy camp.
Or evils outside the Qeynos walls.  I *think* I made enough money in
donations to cover the cost of Bind Affinity, but I'm not sure. I felt sad
at the time for the change, but I stapled a smile on my face and soldiered
on.

Never got any "compensatory" abilities for it either. That's life. It's not
always fair, but that's the way it is. Cry yourself to sleep over your
port utility loss if you feel the need. But when you wake up tomorrow, pick
up the shattered pieces of your druid and move on.


>Maybe we had to lose the port monopoly because of those that exploited it.

Ah yes. The port monopoly that druids had. Well, and wizards too. And
anyone who bought a gate potion from a vendor. Or quested the Overthere
Hammer or Thurgadin gate potions. Or crafted Alchemy gate potions or a
Faithshtone or Spiritstone. Or used a Translocator. Or ported via any of
the Nexus spires. Or the Firepot room in TD. But other than that, yeah,
it was a good monopoly while it lasted...


>It is also a diminishment of our utility and identity to some extent though,

Well, identity isn't something given to you, it's something you *choose*.
You chose to hang your identity on the restricted availablity of ports.
Ouch! I feel your pain, but hope that you will stop wallowing in it soon :)
