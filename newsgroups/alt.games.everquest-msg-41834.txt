Splitpaw gloves 25 pp max, probably less.  Mesh gloves 15 plat or free off of
froglok tadpoles in innothule/Feerrott

200 pp at 20 is not that bad especially if this is your primary/only character.

You can either go Oasis-->N.Ro-->E.FP-->Boat to BB-->shuttles to Timmorous
Deep-->Boat to FV  OR Oasis--> Raft to Timmorous Deep-->Bloated Belly boat to
The Overthere, jumping off as soon as you zone in and swimming to shore outside
of Evil Outpost.  you can actually get bound near the water just inside the evil
outpost.


 Where

As a non Evil FV is the closest you can bank in, or make friends with a higher
level druid who can port you to Misty Thicket (Rivervale is closest bank to a
druid circle to the best of my knowledge) or a Wizard who can port you to G'fay.
