Unless you need the Stamina to get over 100, I'd recommend a Jagged
Blade of Mourning over the Centi LS, while its ratio (13/25) is only
marginally better it gives 3ac, 10dex, and best of all 10mr.

If you're looking for more damage with less agro, and don't need melee
stats, an Arbitor's Combine Greatsword 2hs 30/43 15wis 25mana will
outdamage any combination of the one-handers mentioned.
