You mean of course, other than quitting, and getting on with their 
lives. No reason SOE has to cater to the comparatively small raid crowd 
to float EQ1 or EQ2...in fact it would be more cost effective not too.

One thing SOE never appeared to learn in EQ1 is that your biggest fan is 
actually your least profitable one. The most profitable players in EQ1 
are those that have been playing since '99 and still haven't finished 
Kunark content. They have paid the same fee's the raider's have, 
consumed a 10th of the bandwidth, and a 5th of the content. More profit 
in each of them then 5 hard core raiders.

If 5% of the playerbase wants to rush through, 'beat the game', and 
leave. Let them. The game will be better for it, and much easier and 
profitable to pace content development for the 95% left.

Why should 'raid' content be more cost effective than group content. If 
it takes just as long to progress through it? There is no reason the 
Manaetic Behemoth, or RZtW could not be re-tuned as a 3 hour encounter 
for 6 VT players.

The only reason the 'raid' game evolved in EQ1 was to prevent guilds 
from taking 2-3 groups and just devouring content that was tuned to be 
one groupable. Instancing and encounter locking and other EQ2 features 
eliminates the need to 

Raiding can be an optional encounter type in EQ2, and I have no problem 
if they introduce more of it. But it isn't the only tool EQ2 has at its 
disposal to prevent hard core guilds from just zerging any content tuned 
for 6 people with 12+ people, as they did with *all* the non-raid stuff 
in later EQ1 expansions.

His point was no single caster is going to contribute more than 5, 
unlike EQ1.
