The only one I know for certain is that if you're behind a mob,
it can't dodge, riposte, parry, etc.  This increases the number
of hits you can land on it.

So if you're in a group, get the person with the heaviest
armor and/or the most hitpoints (the "main tank") to get and
keep aggro, and have everyone else run around behind the
mob and whack at it from behind.

Even with only two melee classes, I always make sure we
each stand on opposite sides of the mob, so that no matter
who has aggro, the other person gets to hit from behind.

There's another technique that I'm pretty sure, but haven't
yet proven, is effective.  It seems that the people standing
closer to a mob have a better chance to gain aggro.  So to
help the main tank keep aggro, he should stand right up
"in the face" of the mob, tromping on its toes, while everyone
else who is meleeing the mob should stand as far back as
possible (while still being within weapon range, of course).
I've seen this work well again and again, especially on Kael
raids, because the giants have such huge melee ranges --
you can stand about 15 yards away from it and still hit it,
so this magnifies the size of the effect.  While being main
tank on the Kael giants, my Paladin easily maintains aggro
by standing on the giant's toes and smacking it, while everyone
else stands as far back as possible when meleeing.  But when
they step closer, or I step farther back, I have a significantly
harder time keeping aggro.
