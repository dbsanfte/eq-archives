On 25 Feb 2004 19:26:39 -0800, I needed a Bable Fish to understand

Ahh see.. you are stuck in the biblical terms of god.... there are
many many more belifes than just christianity....

Why would there be a need to flame... if your wrong your wrong.... no

Main Entry: 1prayer 
Pronunciation: 'prar, 'prer
Function: noun
Usage: often attributive
Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French preiere, from Medieval
Latin precaria, from Latin, feminine of precarius obtained by
entreaty, from prec-, prex
1 a (1) : an address (as a petition) to God or a god in word or
thought <said a prayer for the success of the voyage> (2) : a set
order of words used in praying b : an earnest request or wish
2 : the act or practice of praying to God or a god <kneeling in
prayer>
3 : a religious service consisting chiefly of prayers -- often used in
plural
4:  An act of communion with God, a god, or another object of worship,
such as in devotion, confession, praise, or thanksgiving: One evening
a week, the family would join together in prayer.

Seems by definiton, prayer can be both a petition, and / or a
communion with god   
NOT just a request for help / assistance.
