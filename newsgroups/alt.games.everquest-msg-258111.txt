/shrug
I've been in many single group encounters that have dragged on 30-40 
minutes. Wanderers add during the fight, get mezzed, get dealt with, 
repops start showing up...and on it goes.

Of course, it would generally be considered pretty rude to just up and 
go to the pok in the middle of that scenario, but sometimes people have 
to go. And they aren't going to wait for nothing... your hear a series 
of thuds, glass breaking, and your kid starts screaming and you're done. 
Having the presense of mind to even /q is asking too much.

Could be.
Hope not.
