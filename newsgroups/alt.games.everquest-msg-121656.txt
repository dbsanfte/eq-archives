Well, I can tell you one encounter that got a lot tougher. Good 'ole
Lady Vox. My assistant raid leader is still 52 and has been leading
continual Naggy Vox raids for a few weeks every time one is up trying to
get scales for various folks. Was doing really well too.

Thursday night, tried Vox( first dragon raid after patch) and got wiped
with 36 people, even though he'd beaten her with 30 the last time.

Today they went in with 44. TPW. I wasn't there, just watching in raid
chat to see how he did. It was fucking ugly. She heal's sooner, and
throws some NASTY ass Cleric nuke on the first melee hitting her (which
tends to be the MA). Smoked him like a turkey, AoE's everyone all over,
got off a CHeal when they *swear* she was still at above 50%, and took
out the raid.

Not pleasant at all. Some new strat will be required.
