On Morel Thule, this was very much the way I and apparantly most people 
saw this demand.  Open trade window?  Do you not trust us?  Is this some 
lame way of saying "donate and if I like what you give, I'll cast on you?"

Oddly, on Firiona Vie its totally accepted as the norm, and I can see 
why; I've never had a "donation" (aka my best guess at a fair payment) 
turned down, but its a nice easy transaction; I get my payment on my 
cursor, find the caster, hand it to him.  He now has me targetted, easy 
to invite me (for group spells) or to cast on me.  He hits invite, I hit 
the give button and then the follow button, nice and neat.

He can at this point disband me without delivering, of course.  I've 
never seen that happen, and I'm pretty sure he'd quickly get a very bad 
reputation, at a minimum -I- wouldn't be a repeat customer, and the buff 
vendors have each made hundreds, thousands of pp off me over my playing 
life, getting away with a single shot of 25pp just isn't going to be 
worth it.

On MT we used /rt to much the same effect, send tell, get targetted for 
an invite, "donate" after the cast.  Extra step though, and puts the 
burden of honesty on the person asking for the service, who is often 
lower level and has less to lose... not that much less though, it worked 
well enough.

This, I think is very odd.  I cringe when I hear "donation"; they aren't 
sitting there because they saw miracle on 34th street too many times, 
they are there because they want to make money.  Its payment for 
services rendered.  If anything, its a gratuity, since the amount is set 
by the person being served, with an understood minimum in most cases. 
Donation, though?  Is that 65 chanter a begger?  Is he collecting for 
Toys for Tots?  No, he's pocketing the money, and he's not a homeless 
war veteran either.

As a mage, I considered standing around ringing a bell collecting alms 
to buy FT with to replace the mana generation that just got ripped out 
from under me... That would have been requesting donations.  But heck, 
I'm not hurt as badly as monks were, I'll soldier on.

This is indeed the worst, ask for "donation" or even more clearly 
"donate if you wish" and you should be ready to give service in exchange 
for a copper, or a foraged bookworm, just as the Santa from the 
Salvation army is equally ready to wish you a Happy Holiday for a 
hundred dollar bill or a penny tossed into his bucket.

Sadly, Donate is the term that seems to have been adopted by the 
community, which as I said, I think really means to say Gratuity (or Tip)

Splendid One, 58 gnomage, cheap but reliable at 25pp per service
