I'm not sure what your reasoning for these statements is.  After all,
I did cite exactly where it was from (it's not like it's hard to find
on the Web):

Effects of Raising and Lowering Speed Limits, Report No.
FHWA-RD-92-084

U.S. Department of Transportation
Federal Highway Administration
Research, Development, and Technology
Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center
6300 Georgetown Pike
McLean, Virginia 22101-2296

I'm not sure where you got the idea that a US DoT document "sounds
like it was written by a kid that just got their license".  The full
document (according to the site) is 84 pages long.  Admitted, the
appendices aren't there, but everything else appears to be.  The URL
is:

http://www.ibiblio.org/rdu/sl-irrel/index.html

I'm also beginning to think that you squashed together all 3 different
things I was talking about into one inchoate mass.  To reiterate:

1) The above document.

totally separate from:

2) The quote from Department of the Environment, Transport and the
Regions, in the UK.

which in turn is separate from:

3) My own summation of various documents I went through, including but
not limited to my observation that at least one of the reports
indicated that "faster drivers (tend to) pay more attention".



>I notice that statistics and any mention of the method used to arrive
>at these conclusions aren't mentioned.

Now, if you go to the URL above and read the document thoroughly, you
should get at least some of the material you claim you are after,
namely methodology and statistics.



>Topic neatly avoided, point moot, strawman in the dumper.

I suggest you learn what a straw man argument is before you claim that
something is such.  In this case, a straw man argument would be me
putting up an argument *in favour of* lower speed limits, then tearing
the argument apart.  As I have instead advanced material in favour of
*higher* speed limits, you cannot claim "straw man" unless you think
I'm actually in favour of *lower* limits.

I've seen people doing 30 in a 65 zone, thank you.  It finished with
an accident before I got out of sight of them.  A single person
significantly *over* the average traffic speed weaves in and out
(assuming no clear lane) and yes, increases the hazard.  But a single
person significantly *under* the average traffic speed forces
*everyone else* to weave around them, thereby causing more disruption
to the traffic flow than the single speeder does.

I guess you'll have to put me in the "felon" category, then.  I'm out
at 5:30 in the morning, and I usually do about 120 to 130 (this is on
a medianed 4-lane, posted speed 100).  Once the road's clear ahead of
me, I open up a bit.  Top I've hit with my current bike is 161.  Top
I've ever hit was 175 coming into town on a divided 4-lane.  (Top I've
hit at 18 below was 145.  Windchill with a vengeance.)
