There is an even better reason for that... For a caster, twinking makes 
only the slightest difference for themselves, and just about zero 
difference for any group they join, whereas a twinked melee character can 
seriously outperform a non-twinked character of the same level. While 
shouting "Twinked Enchanter looking for group" is *nothing* but bragging, 
shouting "Twinked monk looking for group" is saying "here comes a damage 
monster for a level-appropriate group, or someone who can hold it in a 
higher-level group".

I'm not advocating advertising your twinkage when you are a melee class, 
I'm only saying there is a justification for it that can go beyond simple 
dick-waving.
