The bat/rat bash routine is not "playing" the game.  Once you have run
3-5 (or 10-20) characters through the process, it gets extremely old
and tedious. It's great for the true newbie. It teaches basic game
mechanics (kill-loot-sell-upgrade), and is a great learning tool, but
it isn't "playing the game".

You really don't start "playing" until you hit levels 10-20. At this
point casters have a good selection of spells, and melees are hitting
mobs more often than they miss. 

Even Verant agrees...Look at the changes for levels 1-10.

I think the developers are learning. Take a look at Neverwinter
Nights. The first module of the single player game takes you through
several tutorials and enough combat to teach you the game mechanics.
At the finish of the module you are 3rd level, have decent gear (level
appropriate), and are ready to delve into the main story line.
