This is an interesting point to discuss, though it's been done to death,
I'm sure. I have a monk in early 20's along with a Wiz in early 20's.
We'd both like to camp the hermit in SK. I have the fortune of a job
that allows me to sometimes log on at odd times and grab a normally
camped spot for something which at least one of my characters needs. If
it's a solo spawn, with a drop I really need, and I'm there first, does
etiquette indicate that even if I've been there four hours waiting and
working it, that if you show up and say, "You have to share", that you
should get the rare drop on the next spawn? I guess it's fair in one
sense, but GEEZ! I'm not farming it or anything. Shouldn't I at least
get the first one?
