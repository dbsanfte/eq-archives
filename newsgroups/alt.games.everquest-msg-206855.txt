Thats not what the games about. It's about starting a character
working up skills and helping others while "IN" the Star Wars
Universe.
Your not acutallly playing Star Wars.
Thats why Uber fags won't play it , because there is no way any one
can tell how "Uber" you are. No Phat Loot drops. No fucking title to
brag about.
I've only played maybe a total of 20 hour since release and the
biggest fault I see is the lack of medics in the Hospital.
Personally I think they should have a 'Doctor" on call, it is a
hospital for christ sake. Or at least a Medical Droid that you would
have to pay for your healing.
