The cleric version is a useful tool, expensive at its original cost, useable
when they introduced Focus (clerics and mages being the only classes that really
benefit from cheaper pet casting focus), and much more useable with focus plus
the cheaper cast cost.  Frankly, I'm not sure lowering the cost even more is all
that exciting, it was already plenty cheap.  Drawback of the wizard version is
that you don't get it till 58, so its only good for a couple levels instead of
thru most of your 50s, plus you can't keep it alive thru multiple mobs as
easily, a cleric can afford to deliberately arrange for each mob to hit him once
to keep the pet from killing itself.  Cleric version of the spell also retails
for about 100pp, since its one of the spells you get off handing in spells in
FV/Outpost, or its pretty easy to farm by handing in spells that drop in Skyfire
while working on our epic.  As a 58 spell I imagine the Sword is harder to come
by.
