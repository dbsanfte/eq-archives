In addition, the one FX card that is as cheap as the TI4200 is
the FX5200, and at Tom's they say it appears to be not fast 
enough to actually turn on DX9 features.  Since the TI4200 beats
the FX5600 in almost all respects in non-DX9 stuff and the
FX5600 is clearly superior to the FX5200, we can conclude that
you're better off with a TI4200 over either the low end 
FX cards at this current point in time.
