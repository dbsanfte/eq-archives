From the shadows, the mysterious "Stephen Serniotti"
<tonyserniotti@charter.net> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>There is no way a druid, regardless of level, is going to be able to solo their epic.  Ulump has between 30k and 40k hitpoints depending on your source, is near 100% MR and double hits for around 200.  That fight alone would wipe a druid.  As far as Faydedar is concerned, the best you could hope for is a group of people 60+ with good resists have taken him down, but once again, with him fearing, AE 500 pt DD, and you having to be in melee range to cast on him, once again, a druid soloing him would be another CR waiting to happen.

Ditch the html sig and fix yer linelengths, senor.
