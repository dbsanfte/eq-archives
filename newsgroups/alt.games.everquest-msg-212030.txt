/sigh

I only mentioned the fact that James was Elemental flagged to
highlight the fact to Capn Clueless that his tales of derring do
among the single group dross in Kael and yard trash in PoN doesn't
exactly mean he has any semblance of a clue.

They *completely* piss on the IGS.  I'm sure if James was the sort of
ego led dick waver that needed to have all his twinks in the best of
droppables then they would be.

I don't know a single Warrior that wears gear with no HPs these days.
YMMV.
