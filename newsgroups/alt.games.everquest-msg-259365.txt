	Kinda, I'd just rather have no phone line at all.  DSL, but no
voice phone charges.  Just use a cell phone as my primary and only
phone.  Its not too horrible to have a voice phone though so I don't
really mind, but since its not necessary it would be nice to save that
money, I rarely ever use it.  And of course w/cable, ya don' have to
have phone service to have cable, so if ya don't want a voice phone,
that's even more money you're saving, making it cheaper.  Although
now, w/qwest at least, ya don't have to have voice phone service w/DSL
either, though verizon has yet to offer naked dsl.
