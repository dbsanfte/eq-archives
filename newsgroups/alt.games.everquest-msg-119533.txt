(top post fixed - trust me it's better for you this way)

When you purchase the game from the store you will get the first month free,
so it's kinda like part of the purchase price goes towards your first month,
at least that's how I thought of it. Keep in mind that if you buy the
trilogy you won't see many of the benefits from the Scars of Velious portion
until your character is 35th level, which is the minimum level to enter the
new zones for that expansion.

Question for folks, since I don't actually have that expansion: is this
minimum level like for the planes where it kicks you out or is it like for
normal zones where you'll just get flattened by the first KOS mob whose
daily stroll takes him buy you?
