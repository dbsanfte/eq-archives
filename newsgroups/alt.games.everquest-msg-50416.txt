No, what they said was "players on foot won't be disadvantaged because
**all of a sudden monsters can run faster to make up for horseback
riding.**" [emphasis added]

The way *I* interpreted that was that players on foot won't be
disadvantaged **compared to players on horseback**, because monsters
will be able to run faster to catch up with horses.

Now, I'm happy to accept that my interpretation was wrong, but based
on the wording of the quote, it's not invalid.
