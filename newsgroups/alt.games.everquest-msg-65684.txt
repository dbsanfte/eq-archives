I actually enjoy the tool.  It's come a LONG way since 4.0  Except for
the fact that the underlying language is Basic(not that big a deal since
I taught myself on a dos 3.3/4.01 box). One of these years I may get to
work in VC or VPascal(Delphi).  Until then, I still get to look down on
the Powerbuilder people.

VB and ADO for the small network/RAD/Internal use only stuff we do is
actually very efficient.  We've got some Oracle stuff also.

I very nearly lost my job for something similar to that, and my employer
has difficulty firing people who have my job description.
