To be honest I am not sure.

I noticed on my monitor that when I ran Win98 defrag in detailed view
(Looks like Tetris with all blue blocks), I could see a pattern, when
the screen was full of the little blue blocks, . Behind the nice even
columns and rows it looked like a pixalated crosshatch. Almost like an
optical illusion or shimmer. Just perceptible enough to be annoying. I
started tinkering with my monitor settings. I found that setting the
"Moire" setting to 45% eliminated the wierd pattern. I also noticed
that the images in my games looked cleaner and cripser.

Give it a shot. You can always set it back to "0" if it doens't work.

Something else to try is to set your desktop to 32bit color and edit
the EQCLIENT.INI to run in 32bit color. 

Cheers
