There is nothing in the game rules against refraining yourself from 
slaughtering humans and animals. There certainly *is* something about 
choosing a name that is in tune with the medieval fantasy environment of 
the game. If you cannot understand that, perhaps you ought to do all of 
us a favor and play Counterstrike instead, where a name like 
"I0wnJ00azz" is welcome? It's a long shot, I know, but worth a try...
