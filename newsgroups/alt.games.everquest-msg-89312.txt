I think that even though EQ is a good game and all, that doesn't
excuse them for stiffing their customers like that and I believe that
they should reimburse each player, or make sure that every one gets
the RAM they need to run the game because it's pretty lame that they
would do so. My friend is running a 1.4 GIG P4 with 512 RAM and a
GeForce card and he is still lagging like hell with a DSL line...
