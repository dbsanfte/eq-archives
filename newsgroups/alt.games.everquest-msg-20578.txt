<<SNIP>>
 I am a druid. The best way to insult me is to call me a drood/dr00d,
 or to act like a dr00d around me.
 I have noticed that some people will refer to themselves as a drood in
 a 'good way' the same way some will refer to themselves as a dorf in a
 'good way'. However, I think that more people make a skill distinction
 between a druid and a dr00d than mean anything about a dwarf's playing
 skill with the term 'dorf'.

DORFS RULE!
(damn, that d00d got out again)

   I would never call a druid drood, even after he/she called themselves
one. On the other side, I'll call myself a dorf all day long, then bitch you
out when you call me one. (It's a dwarf thing, you wouldn't understand)
   As a warrior, I am very aware that druids can help me a lot more than I
can help them. And when I am buffed/sowed/ported, I make it a point to be
humble, courteous, and I always offer a donation, even though I'm usually
turned down. Plus I never beg. Unless I die in West Karanas and then realize
I'm still bound in East Freeport. ;)

(and I promise to keep the d00d on a leash. Once I find out where he hid it
.........)
