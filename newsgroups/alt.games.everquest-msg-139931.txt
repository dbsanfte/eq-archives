10 - When Cleric says OOM, Ranger says PULLING
9 - Think you are playing your monk and hit the "5" key which for your
monk is FD, but on the Ranger it is "Forage".
8 - Offer to dual that obnoxious wizard in your group
7 - Declare yourself to be MA and start TANKING with that taunt button
a flying, (for best results, have a Paladin as the healer who does not
tank)
6 - Think you are a monk, rogue, or bard and go careening off of walls
while wearing a lvl 60 SoW
5 - See 2 mobs, go for the pull, get 3 adds and discover that you
cannot split them, so run to your group instead of the zone.
4 - Decide you can zip through a 50+ zone without invis... after all
the exit is "just around the corner"
3 - Wait until you are down to 1/2 bubble of health before thinking
"hmm, maybe I should run"... splat!
2 - Wisely counter 200+ hits with your AWESOME 90 point heal. 
1 - Stand on the top of a wizard spires and announce to the zone "Hey
ya'll, watch this!" Then realize halfway down that you never bought
any batwings.
