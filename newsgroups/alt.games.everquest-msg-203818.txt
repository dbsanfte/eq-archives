OTOH, their dispell removes their DoT (or at least it used to, have not
fought one in a long time).

Ah, there ya go, their DoT is dispellable.
You might try duoing with a Paladin.  Paladin can tank w/o buffs, his
Stuns will keep the chromo agro'd, his Root can stop it from fleeing
until you get that killing nuke off, his heals can keep you both going.
Biggest problem would be mana regen, but a bit of experimentation should
refine your tactics to give you reasonable mana/kill efficiency.  In
fact, Chromos may be a place where Paladin/Wizard duo works well, in
most circumstances they seem to be an ability or two shy as a pair, but
the Chromos don't do near enough DPS to make a Paladin miss his buffs
when there's a Wizard nuking them down.
