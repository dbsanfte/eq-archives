Only if its true that every particle has a completely predictable 
behaviour. Perhaps for an individual particle the best you can do is 
probabilities. Perhaps sometimes they simply go "left" when they should 
go "right" spontaneously. Assuming the left turn is purely spontaneous 
behaviour, ie, it cannot be predicted from knowing the complete state of 
the universe immediately prior to the turn, then one cannot know the 
future, at least not very far, as that spontaneous behaviour will add up.
