Deleted all my characters off the other servers and started on the Aussie
(and NZ) centric Najena server tonight on a Half Elf Scout named Kusanagi
(adv 6 craft 5 of isle of refuge). It was the only server heavily loaded
during +10:00hr prime time so it looks like word got out successfully.

I will be going the Scout->Predator->Assasin route so chose a female avatar
and that just seemed natural for a sneaky backstabber...

*evil grin*

Hmmn - not many bites tonight.
