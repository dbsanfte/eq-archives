The SK I think is the better choice.  The SK will hold aggro better
than the monk which means less overall healing.  The monk may avoid
damage while the SK only mitigates damage but the SK can hold taunt
better.  The SK can taunt and has an arsenal of spells to produce
aggro; the monk does not have either.  If the mob moves onto the
shaman for lack of taunt, there's going to be the need to heal that
shaman.  That shaman doesn't have the avoidance of the monk or the
mitigation of the SK.  If a monk did get aggro back, the shaman might
very well get it again just for healing himself during the fight.
