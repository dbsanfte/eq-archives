So the real problem is you are too afraid to ask for the amount you are 
expecting because you are scared of being called greedy. You prefer to 
misuse the term "donation" when you really expecting a minimum payment 
of 100p, then when you don't get it you abuse the "donater".

If I decided to pay a "donation" of 25p to someone casting KEI on me for 
"donations", then was abused for it, I would feel no shame in throwing a 
torrent of abuse back. Its just plain rude to insult someone for 
donating when you are the one who asked for a "donation" in the first place!

Don't bother asking everyone else to do your dirty work in passing the 
word on to everyone that you expect a minimum payment of 100p per KEI if 
you can't be bothered telling anyone yourself.
