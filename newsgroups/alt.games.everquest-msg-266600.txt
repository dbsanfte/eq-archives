Or they could screw us over by changing the delivery date to the 15th as
they have just done (they have done this to me once before, I don't think I
will be preordering with them again) so tomorrow at 9am my partner will be
at Game getting a normal DVD copy as they don't have the CE and we will have
to wait for Amazon's delivery on the 15th.
