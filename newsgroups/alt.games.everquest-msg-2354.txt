I guess you took my words too literally. First of all, if we are talking 
about tanks, and a tank has 200 hitpoints (so, level 1 twink), there's 
better not be any hill giants in his sight. He does have an option of 
attacking his own guards, if he so choses, but my explanation didn't 
cover that

Actually there are quite a few people doing that. What happened in a lot 
of cases is higher level people saw that they don't like their main 
class/race and decided to remake as something else. I've seen a lot of 
high level monks remake as iksar and give him all of their tradeable 
equipment (makes for some impressive stuff), or remake their paladin 
into ogre warrior, etc.
