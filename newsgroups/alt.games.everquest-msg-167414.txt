Really, Kaev, you of all people accusing me of spin-control tactics.
Jesus, man, I know I'm starting to overuse this phrase, but quit
reading between the lines of what I type if you're too fucking dense
to understand what I actually wrote. You assumed I meant something I
didn't say, now you're desperately trying to make ME look like the
fool. Stop it, it's pathetic. Good god, moron, I think I know better
than anyone else what I meant in what I posted, stop trying to tell me
I meant something else. Admit for once that you were wrong. Swallow
your fucking pride.
