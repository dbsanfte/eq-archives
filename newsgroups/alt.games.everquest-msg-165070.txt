Sorry but getting keys doesn't come close to the emp fight.  Most people on
here could get keys, whether they could kill a single named in ssra or not.

Pouch - I've never seen it not drop on a TM clearing, infact the least I've
ever seen drop is like 3 in 1 clearing.
1st floor - Common, easy, 2 people could do this camp within ease
2nd floor - Can take a few hours to showup sometimes, yeah.  This is the
longest part of the quest, still a very easy camp, doesn't require crowd
control or a warrior.
3rd floor - Takes a fair few people, but by no means rare.

Yeah shards are a timesink, Luclin was all about timesinks

Creator an uber fight?  I dunno about that lol.
As for not giving up on emp/vt if you made the key, well like I said most
people in this NG could get a key with a little time and effort.  Its a very
nice ring for melees and casters, with a great focus effect.
