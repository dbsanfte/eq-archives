Well, I've reached the 29th level and am at a crossroads.  Just about
everyone I know and all my guildies are my level are pretty much content
with hunting in LOIO, Frontier Mountain, OT, South Karana for 3000 levels
because it is easy, convenient and poses little risk.  I am looking to try
and find pick up groups in order to venture out a bit more to dungeon-like
zones and am wondering what is everyones opinion about the following
dungeons fo my level (29).  Take into account fun and enjoyment most likely
(also please look at it from the perspective of someone who is look for risk
and danger, and therefore I find trains to be a bonus not a negative) with
experience, loot ranking lower on the scale for my reason being there.  I am
in no rush to level quickly nor see any need to gain all that phat lewt.  I
just want to have fun, take risks and explore.  With that in mind, please
give me tips on places like Runnyeye, Dalnirs, Mistmoore, Cazic Thule, Sol
A, Upper Guk and anything else you can think of that approately suits a
level 29 warrior.  Thanks!
