(From sitting quietly in the back) Hi Khosh!

    In four years of play, the highest character I got is a level 53 or 54
cleric.  I've played on over a dozen servers, and probably over a hundred
characters all told.

   I show the same tendancy in CoH.  Using supreme force of will, I have
limited myself to 5 characters that I play on a regular basis, one of each
archtype.  I don't have a main there either.

   You are right.  There is no cure.  You are doomed.  We all are.  By the
way, there are cookies and punch on that table in the back.  Help yourself!
