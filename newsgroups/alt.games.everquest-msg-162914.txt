Thats the proposal as I understand it, the LD handler does whatever you tell
it to.  I tell it to wait 12 seconds then cast DA, simple as that.

With DA on you don't get smacked around, as far as I can tell; it doesn't
cause you to stand up, for example, if you get beat on while under DA.

The only thing that hurts while DA is on is DT.  DT beats DA all hollow.

Well, perhaps I misunderstand the idea.  If the idea would allow me to tell
the handler to cast DA 12 seconds after I quit out, then no, it wouldnt' be
the same thing at all.

Thats my point, there will be a couple hundred thousand people thinking about
it for months.  This is the challenge facing the people who design a game
like this, and who tweak it once its out.
