Hmmm... that's okay if you're kiting... but if you're root/dotting you can
screw up the lowbies around P2... the croc pathing takes the deathwalkers up
around the north side of the lake... and a target-fixated newbie can often
fail to see even a SG! :o)

Safer kite is into the 'deep desert' north of the line running from the dock
to Orc Temple... you might pick up the odd Mummy or DB add, but at that
level they're more annoyance than any danger :o)
