You're jumping to more than a bit of a conclusion here.

As I've stated before in this thread, I think that it makes a better (as in
more fun, not "morally superior") game when it is used.   I've made no moral
arguments, other than countering the posters who say it is "unfair" to
people not allowed to roll on x drop.

Really, I think you're assuming quite a bit here about my position and
motivations that has not been said.    Much the same as I did above when
making a comment about your "twink".
