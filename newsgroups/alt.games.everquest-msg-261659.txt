For most characters it should be possible to go to/from max at either
end of the scale. I remember from somewhere that certain races and/or
religons may only be able to get to a certain level of faction
regardless of the effort (i.e. being only able to get to warmly
instead of ally).

I remember a guide regading factioning with Iksars which mentioned a
maximum adjustment of 2,000 from whatever you start with. But that may
be a special case.
