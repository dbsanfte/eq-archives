How is "no binaries" unclear in its not meaning "no binaries except in
signatures"? "No binaries". Period. No "except", no "but", simple "No
binaries".

No, they are not commonly accepted as ok in signatures on Usenet. Even
little VCard signatures get people flamed in every non-binary
newsgroup I've ever been in (with one exception, but that newsgroup
was famous for monster signatures full of pointless quotes exceeding
300 lines in some cases).

Many news servers filter out posts with ANY binary content in a
non-binary group.

>However, that rule seems to be ignored by many people here.

Binaries in this newsgroup appear very rarely, and never (as far as I
have seen) from regular posters.

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.

-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 

(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
