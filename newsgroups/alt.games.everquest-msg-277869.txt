The latest bit I read said very specifically that they will not switch 
existing servers over to be exchange servers.  They will allow free 
transfers to the exchange servers, and will add new exchange servers as 
needed.  They will also consolidate non-exchange servers if their 
population should drop enough to warrant that, but, they would never 
become exchange servers.

Mind you, keep in mind that SoE has been known to go back on their word 
once or twice in the past...
