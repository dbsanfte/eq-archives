Read this thread yesterday and didn't think more about it. 

Then last night we were a few friends hitting Chardok. No cleric, no
chanter or bard and just a single group, but things were going well
and we got past Observer and the first bridge and then pulled from
bridges outside castle.

After surviving 2 nasty pulls (both something like Ancient Guardian +
Add + Bloody Annoying Pop) we called it a day. Ran to Captain to clear
the tunnel to exit then the Earring of Station dropped from some
caster mob. Yay for us!

Well, theory is that the ring is very rare in any zone, but 'least
rare' in the harder ones like Chardok. This is first time I ever saw
one and I've killed a lot of sarnaks in various zones, so while my
story doesn't prove anything it does support the theory.

Good luck to you in your search for one.
