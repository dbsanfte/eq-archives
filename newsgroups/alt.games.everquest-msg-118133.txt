As far as I know the pet always uses it's own delay regardless of what weapons
it wields. This was patched in and widely regarded as a nerf. It will use the
weapon damage if that damage is better than it's own. In other words the weapon
damage must be greater than 1/2 it's max hit. You can test this by giving a two
handed sword to a lower level pet and seeing a sizable jump in its damage. I
believe it will proc weapons if it is of sufficient level...but i've never had
one to waste.
