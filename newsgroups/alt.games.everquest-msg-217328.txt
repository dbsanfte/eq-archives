You are of course completely right in everything you say.  I've
forwarded your post to the Lanys boards and all the guilds there
are disbanding and giving up raiding.  Why, how could we be so dense
as to not see the great glowing light that is LDoN, come to lead
us out of our dispair?

You have truly opened my eyes to what greedy, pushy, loot-whoring ass-
wipes I've been grouping with for the past 2+ years.  Why, how can
I even think of being associated with them?

Thank, truly, from the depths of my heart, thank you.
