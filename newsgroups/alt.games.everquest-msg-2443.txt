Happened to me in Cazic. I freaked out quite a bit. Same problem :
could not log in with my character, getting back to screen when I
tried, while I could log in any others. The GM's answer on the chat
server was helpful :

- delete <zone-name>*.* files for BOTH zones (where you started from
and where you were heading).

- delete <character-name>.opt files.

This worked fine for me.

Jo.
