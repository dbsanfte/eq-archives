If I can remember correctly I hunted my ogre
warrior exclusively in Feerott and Ithonule swamp
until lvl 6 and then took a chance (with sow) and
ran to Freeport for a bind.  It's a little
frustrating in feerott when lizzard man brooding
or watchers jump you in mass and you can't run.  I
pretty much ran up and down the trails hunting
whatever I could find and made sure if I died that
I was right on top of a trail for easy corpse
location. In the Commons I hunted beetles, bears,
spiders, until 7-8 when I started camping the
orcs.  From 11-14 I camped dervs in E commons and
from 14ish-20 orcs in highpass.  20-22 pickclaw
lookouts in the Higpass basement and then it was
off to Lake of Ill Omen for Sarnaks where I sit at
lvl 26.

I'm not familiar with the whole rollplay concept
so I can't help you there.  Good luck.  Get your
ogre a good weapons somehow and it helps things
tremedously.  I had a shiny brass halberd at lvl 3
and hitting for 19 dmg sure helps at those lower
levels.  Axe of the iron back would be nice too.
