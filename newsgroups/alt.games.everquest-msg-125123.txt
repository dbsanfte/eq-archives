It's good to see this.  It depresses me when I see some players slagging 
off the GMs because they don't always do what we'd like them to do.  But 
they do have rules to follow.  GMs are employees, after all, and it's not 
such a game to them, I shouldn't think.

For what it's worth, I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with a 
GM.  The last time was too long ago for me to be able to produce a report, 
but I recall I fell through the deck of a boat in Erud's Crossing and 
couldn't get back aboard.  I got attacked and killed by some nasty and 
returned to my home point in Qeynos, but of course I couldn't retrieve my 
corpse.  I petitioned for help, and although I couldn't actually prove it 
was down to a bug (I might just as well have walked off the deck) the GM 
took pity and rezzed me, even beamed me over to Erudin where I'd been 
heading in the first place.

The other occasion that comes to mind is when I was running around Freeport 
(I think) and I missed my footing (through sheer incompetence, I should 
add) and dropped off a ledge onto the top of some market tents.  I got 
jammed in between the wall and the tent and couldn't move anywhere.  Tried 
to camp, but couldn't sit to do it; tried /quit, but logged back in in the 
same spot, wondered if anything was likely to kill me and decided it 
wasn't, petitioned, and within five minutes I'd been picked up and dropped 
in the market square.

They always seem keen to help when they can and are always polite when they 
can't, and I can't ask much more than that.
