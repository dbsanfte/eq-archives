Maybe I'm not understanding what you mean, but if it's a "denaely 
polpulated area", wouldn't doubling the number of updates per second 
INCREASE lag?...after all, you're having to process twice as mucch data 
as before.  I always thought the majority of lag (not counting bazaar) 
was due to comp speed and grahpics card as well as bandwidth.  Or am I 
totally missing the boat?
