Actually, if you're willing to do semi-active PL, it's hard to beat a
60 Bard.  If I'm singing my AE manasong, my Selo's Assonait Strain,
and Lucid Lullaby I give C3 levels of mana regen, 25hp/tick health
regen, and STA regen, AE slow AND snare all the mobs, AND  AE mez
mobs.

The best part is that on tough mobs I can charm it, click my invisy
cloak, and then it's a mob very angry at the high AC plate wearer,
with almost no HP, and a cleared damage counter.  One poke from a PLee
and exp.
