Any magical quivver will give a percentage of its weight reduction as haste; I
believe the percentage is 33% or so, such that a 60% weight reduction quivver
will give 20% haste.

Do bear in mind that the quivver must say MAGIC on it. The best currently known
quivver thats easily obtainable is the tailored fleeting quivver. You'll need
a HQ lion pelt from a "highland lion" in the karanas, a griffon feather, aviak
oils (made from foraged aviak eggs), and some distilled mana. I'd recommend
getting a few of each to cover failures from your tailor.

The haste stacks with all other haste.
