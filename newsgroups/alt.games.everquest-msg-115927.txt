There is a huge difference between a new player (newbie is normally a term
used be people that consider themself l33t or by beggars) and an idiot. The
new player might also be an idiot and that is where the problem lies. Many
new players are just trying to get on, will ask where things are or what
things do and their questions will be from inexeperience not stupidity.
Example;
New Player_01 shouts "does anyone know where I can find Milla Clothspinner,
shes in the karanas somewhere?"
Idiot_01 shouts "Anyone got any stuff for a newbie?"
Idiot_01 tells you "have you got anything for a 1st level monk, I have
nothing"

Which of these do you think gets help and which receives derision?

As for treating people different online to how I treat them in RL, I am
normally nicer online than I am in RL and find it far easier to avoid and
ignore idiots on the net, the difference mainly being that someone who gives
you grief on the net will get bored with talking as that is all he can do,
in RL it rarely stops at that so ignoring them in the hope they'll go away
will not work.
