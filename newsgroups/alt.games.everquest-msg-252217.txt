Well... if that's your fetish, you should just go role-play no?
Firiona Vie is dedicated to helping that cause. But i don't see much
difference having a mini-max opt fest removing the roles certain
classes play on raid.

Clerics and druids still heal... warriors and knights still tank.
Paladin sure isn't going to slow a mob for you.. unless its as a speed
bump on the way to you. It was a response to your saying people don't
have a role.

True. But it has always been that way. Everquest wasn't a game
necessarily built to support dynamic change.

Oh, yes it does. It dictates what you can do and what you can buy.
Example... Plane of Sky raids.. even back in the day used to be pretty
expensive affairs. If you wanted to raid there you needed pp to
support it. From the buying of coffins to port-up stones. And for
classes heavily equipment oriented they dictate the areas you can play
in. When I was first making my main one of the things i would do is
farm learther padding for pp to buy armor to survive higher areas.
Now... if you want to make the point pp SHOULD have nothing to do with
the world of Norrath, that's another discussion.

True. But we work within the limitations of what was designed. And
there are some very serious drawbacks dealing with a dynamic changing
enviornment.

Which.. if the invasion killed all the quest npc's.. and they were
allowed to stay dead.. would break every quest that they have. If
dynamic change is your thing, why play EQ?

I was referring to always being able to fix faction at uber levels by
PBAOE. Freeport faction is commonly a 3-hour fix with a hand-in quest.
6 if you are kos in Erudin. Not to mention the only realistic way to
fix Growth faction is a 3-hour fix in Freeport with a druid at the
start to help get out of KoS.
