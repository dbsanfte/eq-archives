I started that quest yesterday and finally deleted it when I couldn't find 
Fippy's Hill (step 2 or 3).  I had the LOC and went as close to it as 
possible, but there was a tower there that I couldn't get in.  I ran all 
around that damned place and couldn't get it to give me credit for it.

Any ideas?
