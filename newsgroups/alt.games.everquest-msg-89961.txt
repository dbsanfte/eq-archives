Well, sadly people paying 39 bucks a month are not going to like
events which turn out that way after 3 hours. Can you really blame
them? 

From my experience with several verant actual GM (live body
controlled, I don't count NPC zone changes as GM events) events, its
best to not even bother. Unless they have really changed the way they
do them a lot, many people are going to be very disappointed with the
price increase when they find for the most part they are spending a
lot of their time in gm events that suck ass with no reward. 

From every post I've read from people who are planning on going to
this server, its clear that they all think its going to be a monty
haul. They think that, unlike their old server, they are going to get
fat loot with little or no work or without needing the help of others.
I really doubt if its going to at all equal their expectations or come
anywhere in the remote realm of being close.

The reality is they are paying 39 bucks to have a web map tracking
their and their guilds travels in zones, an updated web magelo like
thing, a place to make their guilds page, a premium server type
population in the same way people on a plane fly first class to not be
near the rabble, the ability to witness probably 2 gm events a week
(probably less) which are far too crowded where ONE person might get
some kind of reward.. maybe. Really the most worthwhile thing sounds
like the new quests or loot which will only automatically exist on
that server first (NPC/quest type content, non human player) But even
in the case of the server only content, if these people are not the
people out finding the quests and new drops in the current EQ game
what makes them think they are going to be the people doing it on this
server?

It also still remains to be seen how much of the added content will
still require being high level and having several buddies with you.

I'm not envying any of these people yet and I probably won't be.
