An honorific.  Append it to a name as a show of respect/station.  It's more
formal than -san, which is considered to be the neural/polite honorific.
Usualy used with nobility.

I'm not sure if the greeks pulled them from Arab texts, though it does seem
a bit dubious.  Even if it were so, that was then, this is now.  Times
change, and civilizations rise and decline.

A recent problem owing absolutely nothing to socratic method (which probably
isn't taught to those who can't read).  Can you draw a parallel?

Of course, Iraq is well know for it's liberal education.  Let's see...
you're discussing graduate students who, by nature of being graduate
students, have shown themselves to be a bit ahead of the unwashed masses.
Yeah, you'll probably get some bright ones there, big suprise.  When I was
in Bahrain, I was struck by the wide gulf in the education between the
Bahrain citizens, and the Saudis.  Of course, that may be a bit of bias,
since the Saudis weren't very nice people to Americans.

As far as your stating that universities are eager to recruit them, do you
have anything to back that up?  Are the universities out there screaming
"Arabs, we need more arabs, any arab will do!"?
