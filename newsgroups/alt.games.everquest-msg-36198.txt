Here, let's use the table on the site YOU linked to to prove that the
levels following hell levels aren't "mini levels":

lvl    xp to complete level
28 [....] 2,269,000   
29 [....] 2,437,000   
30 [....] 5,311,000   
31 [....] 3,070,100   
32 [....] 3,274,700   

Oh, yeah, 31's *definately* a mini level. (don't slip in the sarcasm)
Compared to 30, yeah, but 30's a hell level. It's the same with all
the other hell levels and post-hells.
