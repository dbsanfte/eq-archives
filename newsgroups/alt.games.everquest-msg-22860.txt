I've never tried casting rez on any corpse I wasn't standing right next to,
but I bet it's got the same maximum range as healing spells.

And remember, if you're rezzing yourself, you DID die, so there is a chance
you'll have a hostile NPC next to your body - not something you'd want to
show up beside while suffering from rez effects ;)
