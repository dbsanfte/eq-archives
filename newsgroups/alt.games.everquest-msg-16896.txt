Range against certain Velious mobs can be the single biggest
determining factor as far as aggro is concerned.

A warrior triggering defensive will generate significantly less damage
than a warrior who isn't using that discipline.  However, against a
mob like say the Vindicator, the warrior with the discipline up as
long as he remains the closest will often maintain aggro.

Similarly a cleric/necro/paladin firing DA (harmshield) and sitting
directly under the mob will often "win" the aggro--this allows for the
few seconds that DA/harmshield is up, to have the mob beat on someone
who takes zero damage while the rest of your raid can beat on the mob.

Aggro control is about the single biggest factor in determining
whether you win or lose against any big mob these days (the other
factors are how quickly can you generate the neccessary damage before
all your healers go OOM).
