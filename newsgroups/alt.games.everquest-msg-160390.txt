Microsoft seems to take a long time to do anything reasonably
well, and they seem unable to get good results out of more
than one project at a time in spite of their size.  The early
versions of Windows came out while they were still in the
process of competing for the word-processing market (and Mac
users were among their key beta-testers, er, customers for
that battle, heh).  It was after the WP battle was mostly won
that they seemed to get really ambitious about Windows.  They
learned a lot from Apple and IBM about user-friendliness and
multi-tasking technicalities and they put that together with
a lot of money and their very substantial business savvy to
pursue their vision of a computer on every desktop (running
MS software, of course).  They don't innovate, and they've sold
a lot of stuff that was of pretty poor quality, but they know
how to sell and they know how to beat on a project until they
get good results, no matter how much it costs their customers.
