This might be an old question but I'll want to know what you guys
think anyway.

I've been using a FBSS but I start to think of getting more AC and STR
from a TBB instead as I don't really see the speed difference with and
without the FBSS.  What would you wear at lvl 51?
<snip>

Don't really see the speed difference?  Not knowing what weapons you wield,
I beleive it.  If AC is critical (ie, you're the only tank and lacking the
buffs of other classes and you *need* to hold a mob, I might choose the
TBB), otherwise I would go with the FBSS.  Honestly, you're not going to see
a great difference in your hits with the TBB and if you're depending on 8AC
to save the day then you might want to rethink it <G>.  It's used mostly to
carry more stuff or by races that lack strength...like elves ;)

Folks often get hung up on the 'hit eye candy', eg, a rogue who gets a nice
backstab and such.  How much damage you do over time is what really counts
and for that you'll want a haste item.

BTW, I don't recall offhand the exact stats, but:

FBSS=flowing black silk sash, haste item
TBB=thick banded belt ac8 15str
