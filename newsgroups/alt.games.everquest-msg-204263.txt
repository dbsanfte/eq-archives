PoI is a pretty nasty place to get back into playing a cleric. It's
trainy and there's unslowable mobs there (ancient something?). Whether
you can reasonably succeed there as even a great 53 cleric will depend
to a large extent on the rest of the group. How tough is your tank,
how quickly can he grab and hold agro, who's your slower? 

Cast Cel healing on your tank before the mob gets to the camp if your
group is marginal. You'll have a bigger margin for error until the mob
is slowed. 

Get a feel for your tank in any group. Is he high enough lvl to take
an initial beating or is he outclassed for whereever you're hunting?
Is he an SK or Pally and able to grab initial agro quickly so your
slower can get to work faster? 

Next, get a feel for your slower. A 60+ shaman with Malo should have a
mob slowed within seconds. A lower level shaman will have to worry
about bouncing a debuff first so it could take longer. An Enchanter
has to worry about agro on his tash, he'll always get a mob slowed
relatively fast but has to wait for the tank to grab agro first. How
long that is depends on the quality of your tank's taunt. A bard
almost always has a mob slowed the fastest since their slow has a
built in resist modifier.  A beastlord will occasionally have a bad
streak of slow resists, be prepared for it. 

A good cleric has a feel for how his group works together and how fast
any given pull will damage that group. The only way to get to that
point is through trial and error.

Sebilis, The Hole, Chardok, Howling Stones, ME, BW (Giant Fort). 

If you want to stay in PoP, try PoD. The mobs there aren't any easier
but it's easy to pull singles. It's a good place to get a feel for
healing against PoP mobs.
