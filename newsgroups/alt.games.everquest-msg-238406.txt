The best way to get most of the expansions is to buy the Everquest 
Evolution package, which includes all of them up through Legacy of 
Ykesha. Then you can buy Lost Dungeons of Norrath and/or Gates of Discord 
which are the two that came out after Evolution. I consider this to be 
the best deal and the best way to get started in EQ (having access to the 
Plane of Knowledge really opens up your options on where to hunt, even as 
a newbie).

Ok I just looked up what New Dawn is and it looks like you have the 
expansions up through Luclin. So you're missing Planes of Power and 
Legacy of Ykesha from the Evolution package. I'm not sure which is 
cheaper (buying both of those or just buying Evolution).
