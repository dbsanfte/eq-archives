 >As much as I hate dying, I wish we hadn't been so lucky.

Reminds me of a puller in DSP. Kept bringing back two,
three or four cavemen, running off when we were still
in the middle of killing all of them, coming back with
another two or three of them (Whoops! Two aggroed!).
Then, when he *finally* got rooted by one of the casters,
yelled for help until he died because the rest of us
were fighting for our lives on little life/little mana
trying to kill the last three guys he had pulled to us.

Didn't have much pity for him, gotta say.
