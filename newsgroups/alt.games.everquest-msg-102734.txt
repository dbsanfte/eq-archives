There I was with my 47 monk sitting in Crystal Caverns when suddenly
an Orc Miner comes up to me, and rather than attacking asks for help! 
The would-have-already-been dead miner went on to tell me that Foreman
Rixact caught him loafing and was coming to punish him for the act of
laziness.  Now, being that I'm a lazy person myself, I felt sorry for
this little orc and when Rixact showed up a minute later, tried to
tell him not to fight my new orc friend.  Rixact is a funny guy,
believing in the shoot first, ask questions later theory of life, and
proceeded to attack me.

Well, the orc was glad, as it meant that he was probably going to live
a little while longer as I was pretty handily beating Rixact down. 
When Rixact would have normally run, he stopped fighting and plead for
his life.  I stopped fighting as well, and told him that if he would
spare this pathetic miner's life, I would spare his.  Rixact agreed,
(maybe Orcs aren't as dumb as I thought...) and went back to his post,
no doubt to find other loafing orcs.

The orc thanked me heartily and gave me a full set of Black Panther
armor for saving his life.  He told me he caught a sleeping monk down
in his mines a while ago, and though the armor made him look fat, kept
it for just such an occassion.

He then ran back into the mines and was mixxed in with the other
miners that slave away for the Ry'gorr nation.

I guess sometimes treating one's enemies with respect has its bonuses
after all.
