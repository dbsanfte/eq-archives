Due to a problem with my ISP, l lost all the previous posts in relation to a
lot of good topics, one in particular was the number of the security patch
which caused major lag problems.  Would anyone still have that reference
number please, l would hate to re-apply it and go through all that stress
again if l can avoid it.

TIA,

Pamela
