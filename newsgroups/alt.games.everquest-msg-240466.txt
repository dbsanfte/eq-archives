yes it is mentioned in "eqmanual_supplement.doc". unfortunately i did not 
read that far. i now get killed as soon as i cross over into the east 
commonlands. and then maybe get killed a few moee times in front of west 
freeport (and sometimes inside the gate). then i get to memorize my spell 
again a try to get to a monster in the east before i get killde 
again. sigh :(

maybe i should start over on that viona fir or whatever it's called. or 
look for a mmmorpg that is more ad&d like (so i have a clue :)

thanks
