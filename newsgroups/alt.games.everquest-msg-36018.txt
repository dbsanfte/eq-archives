Well since you have no agp slot, really you should upgrade your entire
compaq motherboard by ripping it out and buying a new one if you can.
If you can't you can get a fully new pc case and power supply for like
35 bucks or so and an mb for probably 125 or less, toss in the old
stuff and go to town.

Without doing that I think there is a PCI geforce 2?
