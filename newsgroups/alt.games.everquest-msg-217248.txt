Might work, though so far the best group I have been in was 5 people, 2
bards, 1 mage, 1 cleric, 1 SK. No one went below 50% health (well except the
one trap after it was complete) and never less than 75% mana. We beat a
collection in just under 35 minutes. Cleared the dungeon in the remaining 30
and opened all the chests. Now admittedly we were only mid 40's, though in
the 65 groups I have not seen much hard mobs in relation on the easy
missions.
