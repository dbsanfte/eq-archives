My favorite race over all is probably barbarian.

going strictly on looks I think Dark elves have some of the best looking armor
sets, especially out of velious.  There are only three races in my opinion that
look decent in the new velious armors, in order of preferance Dark Elves, Wood
Elves, Humans and in particular female humans.  All the other races look stupid
in the velious armor sets in my NOT so humble opinion.  Rygorr on a barbarian is
one of the ugliest armors i have ever seen, and what's up with the ledderhosen
of the velious leathers on barbarian males.  Half elves WITHOUT a helmet look
fine in armor, but put a helmet on them and they look like they are trying to be
Robocop.

Probably my main, Barbarian Rogue.  Okay dex and agility, which despite being
listed as a rogues main attributes, don't really mean squat.  Way more strength
than any other rogue capable race, which is a huge advantage in getting your
backstabs up in damage.  Ac, HP and Str are in that order the primary stats for
a Rogue in my opinion.  


I am fond of my Erudite Necro, and if Kunark ran better on my POS computer I
would have kept my Iksar Necro.  Iksar might be the dumbest necros but you have
to love that regen/dark pact combo.
