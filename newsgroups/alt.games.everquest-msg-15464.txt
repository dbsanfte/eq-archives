Don't waste your time with the AC on SO Ro, the one in OOT is much more
common, but a bit tougher.  I have camped the AC in oot for a total of
20 hrs and have seen him 6 times.  I read that he spawns 3% of the time,
that's 3 times every 10 hrs assuming your keeping up with the kills.
Don't waste your time with the t boots, there even slower and the effect
has a casting time, might as well buy sow potions for the 5k price of t
boots.  J boots' effect is instant, you can activate on the run and are
faster then 90% of the creatures out there.  They are barely faster than
giants though, so I wonder if T boots will be able to outrun them.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp
no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant
companion of your walks."
