Unless you are on Firiona Vie, in which case your augment is droppable, 
and any item you augment with it remains droppable unless it was 
undroppable beforehand (and precious little is).

While it remains true that if you want to replace the +3 int augment you 
put on your Stein of Muggok back in your 30s with a +5 int augment, on 
FV its possible to sell the augmented stein, buy a replacement stein, 
and augment that.

OK, I know its embarassing that I am using such crap gear, but honestly, 
I'm a magician, I wish every single item I was wearing was summoned!
