The problem I kept running into was that root would wear off, and it was out
of range before I could finish casting again.  If I move up to one that is
moving, stop, cast, by the time the spell is finished, it is out of range.
I am far from an expert in the game, but I was using the exact same tactics
that I have used for many levels.  I have very rarely had a problem where a
mob would move out of range of a spell while it was being cast.  This
includes some mobs that move fairly fast.  Maybe it's just me, but the spell
range seemed to be seriously reduced.
