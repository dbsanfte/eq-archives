That would be part of the problem. My Pentium 2 with 3dfx voodoo 3 
doesn't even run EQ anymore. Personally I'm glad the game isn't still 
being targeted at that platform.

SOE is doing its best to keep the game current. That's going to leave 
older systems in the lurch. Its not exactly fair but that's life. The 
hardware specs in long term multiplayer games is a rolling target.

by quit you mean take a break. How many times have you cancelled?

So now new content should be what decided by whoever posts the most on 
the forums? Great, I can see it now the next expansion will bring the 
hillgiants back in full force, double the amount of cash they drop, come 
with a signed contract fro SOE that every giant will drop at least 20pp 
and the amount will never be nerfed, and remove the place holders so its 
nothin but giants. Maybe even instance Rathe Mountains so the farmers 
can each have their own little giant farm. Preferrably with a banker who 
doesn't care about faction in each corner, and one in the middle. And a 
vendor who sells mana regen, and haste potions next to them.

Players are decidely short sighted. Especially the whiners on forums. 
The last thing we need is development by forum-vote.

Well... I quite like the translucent webbing on the murkgliders, and I 
love the way the new models skins looks rough, or shiny, or rubbery 
depending on the model. The water finally looks like liquid.

It looks like a modern game.

I hope you enjoy raiding negafen then.

You can't just add new stuff without breaking old stuff in a complex 
system. The amount of regression testing is astronomical and 
expensive... in a critical system it gets done. In a GAME it doesn't; 
there's no time, and no money.

FWIW I agree SOE can be pretty lax, lets some real bonehead mistakes 
through, and seems drag their feet fixing annoyances, especially little 
ones that should be easy fixes.

But that's hardly call to stop developing new content.

Maybe the bug team is busy trying to sort out why you get dropped to the 
desktop 5 times a day.
