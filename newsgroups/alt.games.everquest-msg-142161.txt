Uhhh...hmmm... The person you are SUPPOSED to give the Ro's Breath and the
1kpp to is Camin. If you got far enough that he allowed you to give him
those things, and he responded correctly, then that's all there is to it.
You don't need him anymore after you bring him back the Ro's Breath to have
the charge stripped. So what he thinks of you doesn't mean jack squat, after
you've gotten what you need from him. HOWEVER, don't try doing even this
part too early, I tried to do the "running around" part at level 44, and he
ate the 1kpp and the Ro's Breath, and asked me how one so inexperienced got
that item, and that he'd just hold it and give put it in its proper place.
