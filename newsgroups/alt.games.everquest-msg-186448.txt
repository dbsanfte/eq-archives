Again, you know me not.  I have no goals in the game other than to have a
good time and forget about RL worries for a little while.

I tie absolutely no self esteem to the game.  I could really care less about
levels, tradeskill mastery, mountains of platinum, etc.  There will be no
mention of my gaming ability on my tombstone, nor in my epitaph.

All facts which generally annoy the powergamers I know of.

I'm not sure why you choose to wave AC2 around like some sort of pathetic
voodoo doll.  Sure, everything I've read about in CGW and other rags say it
stinks, but I've never played it so all I have in anecdotal evidence.  If
you're trying to impress me with it, your effort is failing.

Frankly, if I wanted immersion I'd pick up the BattleTech book that's been
sitting on my nightstand for a few months.  A game is lousy way to look for
immersion, IMO.
