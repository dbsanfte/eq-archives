they nerfed some of the primary hand bonuses that made super fast weapons
desirable even if their ratios werennt as great.

id put the best weapon in primary. given identical ratios on two different
weapons, id take one with lower delay.

dual wield vs. 2nd is not just a question of damage. its also a question of
riposte and taunt. if you want to be the primary tank u need to keep the mob
hitting u. that either means doling out alot of damage, or doling out high
aggor procs.  if you want to use your riposte disc, a 2hd is superior as the
riposte will be larger.

when fighting top end mobs sometimes u dont want aggro.  2nd weapons with no
procs come in handy in this situation.

trying to have one solution for all of the different scenarios is not the
way to go. in your gear and choice of weapons, a situational approach is
much better.
