I can tell you, from my experience in a family oriented guild, it ends up 
being the same few people that are doing the flagging of others, because 
they are the only ones that can actually get it accomplished effectively.  
The flagging process right now, just is that hard.  If it were fixed to be 
a reasonable barrier that tests your ability to effectively fight in the 
Tier 2 planes, then, I would not have a problem with it.  As it stands, it 
is simply a test of your ability to put together an extremely high DPS 
group.  It discriminates against low DPS classes, such as shaman, that are 
highly desirable in Tier 2 zones.  It discriminates against people who can 
solo in tier 2 zones.  What kind of a test of your ability to fight 
effectively in tier 2 zones is that?  I know you have said that you would 
be for fixing the trials, they certainly need it, at the moment, they are 
seriously broken.

It does get extremely frustrating to try time after time after time to get 
flagged, and this does cause stress, in just about anyone experiencing it.  
This stress can ultimately lead to issues in the friendliest of guilds.
