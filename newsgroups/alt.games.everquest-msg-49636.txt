Port into Skyfire.  Be dispelled by one of the 4 dispelling mobs
hanging around the portal.  Be attacked by those 4 and the other 3
mobs that were there with them.  The Wizard with tboots dies.  The
Wizard with jboots runs away.

Another use for instant-cast items is protecting buffs.  I know people
who put and keep several instant-cast buffs up before their regular
buffs, so when something dispells several buffs (higher level
dispellers do up to 4 at once (does anything do more?)), it gets the
instant-cast ones, which they then recast.  When you've got raid-level
buffs up that take expensive components to cast, this instant-cast
protection trick can save you hundreds of plat in components (and, of
course, save your life, because you keep your buffs).
