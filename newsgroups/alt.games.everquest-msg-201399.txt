Yes, I noticed that.  It's a false dichotomy and Rumble fell into it.

It's not a matter of "KEI or sit on your ass, and I'm defending
sitting on your ass", it's a matter of either having KEI at
inappropriate levels, or figuring out how to play more intelligently
in order to avoid sitting on your ass.  It is possible, you know.

KEI doesn't help me burn down stuff all that much, what it does is
eliminate to a great extent the old game balances for burning stuff
down.  Back then, I could just as easily burn things instead of
root/dotting, but I didn't do that because I realized "if I do that,
I'll have to do nothing but sit on my ass for the next three minutes. 
Or if I get an add, I'll have to run to the zone or die.  So I won't
do that.  Instead, I'll manage my mana better so that once this thing
dies, I'll be able to go right out and find the next thing to kill. 
Or if that simply isn't possible, I'll find some other people to join
me so the stuff I'm killing doesn't require too much of my mana for
each kill."  Yes, I was able to do that before KEI.

It's not an either or thing.  To rail against KEI doesn't mean you're
in favor of people sitting on their asses all day.  The problem is,
the more prevalent KEI becomes, the less likely people are to do
anything to prevent it from being a "burn, then sit on my ass"
situation when they don't have KEI, because they've never learned
anything else.  With KEI, it's just "burn".
