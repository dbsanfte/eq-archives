paladins are actually fairly usefull to have on raids. They do fairly decent
combat dammage, have a group heal that is suprisisngly usefull against any
uber mobs that has an ae weapon, and there ability to place a mob with
invulnerability usually accounts for one less aoe everyone takes at the
start.

wizards are odd , but i consider them mostly balanced . I would give them a
long time cast no mana cost nuke though to cover for them untill they get
higher in level. They are not really welcome in an exps group though except
for ae ones. They are a bit harder to solo than a druid but more rewarding.
Many wizards will learn the art of nuke running without the use of snare at
all , this is harder to time than with snare but since wizard spells are
more effecient actually leads to more exp per time. Wizard quad kiting is
significantly harder than druid quadding cause that 2 min ae snare just
dosent cut it nearly as well as the 11 min ensnare does. On the other hand
the wizard efficiency means less mana used , more quadds per time period and
thus more exps.
