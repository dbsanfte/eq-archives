    As has been pointed out to you, -10 STR is nothing. The amount of aggro
I lose from the miniscule DPS difference is not going to make a bit of
difference.

    Well, I'd say that LARGE amounts of STR would make a difference. If the
shoulders were -50 STR, I might blink. But not 10 STR. A level 1 enchanter
can buff 10 STR, and I don't see anyone begging them for it.

    Most of what is available for us folk is in the 12 AC range, like the
Tattered Mantle or the Western Wastes shoulders. And those things don't give
125 HPs like these do.

    I use the standard conversion formula between trading off AC and HPs, 1
AC to 10 HPs. These shoulders give Mandy 125 HPs net, and get better as she
levels (1.5 HPs/level roughly). The usual AC 12 alternatives don't have 55
HPs on them. It's not even close.

    Yes, but who gives a crap about a shaman healing? My warrior wants a
cleric behind her, you know, that class that heals you to max every time?
Then, even though you need more healing, the fact that it takes the mob
longer to chew through your HPs starts to come into play. Hence the 1 AC =
10 HPs tradeoff formula warriors use.

    Which, as we've pointed out, this given warrior could not wear even if
she wanted to wear it....

    Yes, wearing 145 HP items (at level 60) is certainly a disadvantage. I'm
surprised Davian was able to overcome it!
