I'd say that's a good choice - it gives you the option of running any
of the current races (you wouldn't have Iksar available if you didn't
get Kunark).

And, Velious is geared towards higher level play only. No point
dropping the $10 or $20 on it until you know you like the game.

What are your machine specs? CPU, RAM and Video Card?

Everquest isn't actually graphics intensive, but the graphics engine
isn't well optimized, so it runs slower than it probably should on any
given platform. But then, it isn't a twitch game, so high frame rate
isn't as important.

Google is your best bet for a first choice. Almost every problem has
been had by someone, so search there first. Then, if you can't find an
answer (entirely possible with the state of Google vs Deja), come
here. We've got some pretty good propeller-heads here.
