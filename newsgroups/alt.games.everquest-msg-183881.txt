Darn - you broke it when you said does not involve a bard. lol.

Actually, yes, a few different things. How much depends no what you consider
"skill". If you mean manual dexterity, then the main thing that comes to
mind is a chanter targetting multiple adds for mezzes.

If you mean "skill", as in "dexterity or coordination especially in the
execution of learned physical tasks" then probably not. If, however, you
mean "the ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in
execution or performance" or perhaps "a learned power of doing something
competently : a developed aptitude or ability", then absolutely yes.

I have, for example, met tons of clerics that know that they need to avoid
aggro, that they need to heal folks before they die, etc., etc., etc.. Now,
actually getting down the balance of when to heal over time vs. CH vs. not
heal (wait a bit and let it get closer) is a bit more tricky and, IMHO,
requires skill. Rare is the chanter I've met that is at the top of their
skill game in terms of not only mezzing mobs quickly, but watching timing of
buffs wearing off, knowing what mob to mez or NOT mezz (sometimes it's
better to let someone take the brief beating rather than risk aggro and
death of the chanter), etc., etc., etc.. The list goes on and on. Lots of
folks know that "nitpicky knowledge", and the "mechanics" are easily
mastered. Implementing that knowledge and mechanics correctly and
effectively when things don't fit nice neat checkboxes is, to me, all about
skill and adaptation. There is LOTS of that in game.
