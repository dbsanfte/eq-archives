Another possible alternative is to see if there is a cleric camping Grimblox
in the King room, and if so will they help you.

When my cleric was camping thus sucker my mind was going numb, until a
ranger wandered in zone and asked for some help.  Basically I sat near the
king room while he ran around clearing/pulling to the area with me throwing
heals and bufs on him.   We stayed ungrouped so he got the exp.

He got all the loot and exp, I got someone to talk to, and didn't have to
worry about being swamped with goblin spawns  (even though they green, they
always agro on me - very annoying).  We had the near spawns timed, so we
didnt have unexpected pops.

I did however make it very clear that if he managed to mass overpull, I
would probably gate, then come back to rez him.  Only once however did he
bring 4 mobs back, most other pulls where single or double.  There was only
2 others in zone, and they where killing Gnomes, so basically we had the
entire Goblin side to ourselfs.  I suspect he got some nice loot....

Side note.  Never did see Grimblox spawn.   Still need to go back and camp
him more.   /cry
