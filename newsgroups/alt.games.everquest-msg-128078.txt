That is someone who doesn't understand the function of the cleric. I
hate that when it happens. I have been in  groups which scatter when
the warrior goes down, even if the enemies are nearly dead or there is
a back up tank like a pally or SK.

Ha! I know this. A wood elf of mine once teamed up in WC with a cleric
who had a warrior-syndrome. We were fighting giants and although 3
people died and our cleric did nothing else but meleeing the giants
during the fight, he didn't cast a single spell. At the end of the
fight he asked if anyone needed healing.... err... try resurrection?
