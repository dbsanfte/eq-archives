Lol.. melees already got upgraded, for "balancing" reasons -
New combat tables, tripple attack for more characters, increased skill caps
etc

Disarm trap and pick lock useless?  right :)  Certain raids are only
possible because a rogue is there to pick locks (even exp groups, e.g crypt
in sebilis)..  or allows the rogue to avoid the often tedious task of
hunting down keys

Disarming traps can save your groups life, or at the very least save a long
time on buffing.. imagine you just spent 20mins buffing your group and
medding, to go fight in Velks pits.   (group aego and focus 1200+ mana each,
let alone everything else)

These buffs are close to crucial in the higher end game.. so what happens
when you all drop down the pit, and hit the dispell trap?   Well assuming
your group doesn't wipe out, you now have to sit, med, rebuff and med,
before you can get back to killing.

With a rogue, they can disarm that trap and avoid any of the previous from
happening.

As for tracking.. I'd love tracking (Im a monk).. maybe if they could
introduce a limited tracking ability (say on a par with druids or bards, not
rangers), and make it obtainable via 10 or so AA points (in the class
abilities)

That would mean the mass majority of people wouldn't have it.. but if you
REALLY wanted it.. well put the effort in and get in.
