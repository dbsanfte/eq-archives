Rack them and stack them . Also helps if a otherwise useless person does the
pulling (like the chanter). Your post does not fit the facts is the big
part. Many times as part of just a pickup group in pov or tactics I can
manage a rate of 2 yellow an hour in AA . This is casual play and not really
that intense. I can solo perfectly well with either my chanter or druid (not
of course my monk since he has been nerfed into uselessness for groups and
soloing) but come nowhere near the exp gain and it is also harsh enough in
boredom and aggravation to not be the least bit enjoyable.
