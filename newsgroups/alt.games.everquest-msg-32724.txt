I went to that site you mentioned. Below is the results.

SHIELDS TEST:
*-* Your Internet port 139 does not appear to exist!
One or more ports on this system are operating in FULL STEALTH MODE!
Standard Internet behavior requires port connection attempts to be answered
with a success or refusal response. Therefore, only an attempt to connect to
a nonexistent computer results in no response of either kind. But YOUR
computer has DELIBERATELY CHOSEN NOT TO RESPOND (that's very cool!) which
represents advanced computer and port stealthing capabilities. A machine
configured in this fashion is well hardened to Internet NetBIOS attack and
intrusion.
*-* Unable to connect with NetBIOS to your computer.
All attempts to get any information from your computer have FAILED. (This is
very uncommon for a Windows networking-based PC.) Relative to
vulnerabilities from Windows networking, this computer appears to be VERY
SECURE since it is NOT exposing ANY of its internal NetBIOS networking
protocol over the Internet.

PORTS PROBING:
(simplified)
...either your computer is turned off or disconnected from the Net...
(all ports it tested came back as stealth...this being at 5:50AM in my area,
and on cable modem. I know my router has alot to do with this. It doesn't
even like me willingly sending files with YahooIM or MSIM, and rarely worked
on Napster (I can receive all I ask for, but unable to send most of the
time). At times my system's security acts like the over protective parent
who's child, although it might happen to be the day of their 18th birthday,
it wouldn't be 18 years after they're boarn for another 5 minutes, so they
are still not allowed to watch movies, TV, or listen to music above a "G"
rating. (heh heh...off topic, but I've always thought of how screwed up
someone would be from that style of life, or even worse, what the parents'
reactions would be if after 18 years of treating their kid like that were
told something similar to "shut the hell up you d*** f***ing b**** before I
kick your a** and beat the living s*** out of you!" {think that covers the
basic more common words} I mean reactions other than those similar to
wondering what the penalty for 1st degree murder is, or the chances of
getting caught.)
