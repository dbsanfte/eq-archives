Sorry, but i find the "Servers down WTF!??" both boring and mildly irritating.
You can't expect the servers to be up 'all' the time, they're going to come
down from time to time and I just dont understand why people rush to this NG to
post the exact time they couldnt get in, number of tries so far, followed by a
horde of 'me too''s.
It's not the end of the world if you cant play EQ for a while.
