Thanks Brent,
I am going to try to find the CD's as cheaply as possible, but I was
wondering if the original was needed before the others. I was also curious
as to "what all you get" with the variance in price. Does this mean the
cheaper versions of EQ CD's are lacking something (manuals perhaps?).

She is on cable (thank heavens) so the updates shouldn't bother her.

As for the dragons, someone said you could learn to speak to them. She would
probably sooner play this way than kill them, I am guessing, but once she
gets into the game, who knows.

As far as the time, I surmise that I misspoke here, but you provided the
information I was looking for in spite of my misstating the question. The
weapons are medieval in nature, with no 'space ray guns' etc. Thank you!

Thanks for the advice on begging and earning also. I appreciate the
information.

:)
