I uploaded a new alpha version to my website. I added the ability to set 
hotkeys. I've got the code to manage the abilities and combat buttons, but 
I'll need some opt files with the various buttons set. I don't have any 
high level characters so there are many different abilities for which I 
don't know the values. Anyone willing to send me some opt files (with notes 
or a screenshot showing the buttons assignments)? That is about all that I 
need at this point. Well, that and feedback on the new exe file.
