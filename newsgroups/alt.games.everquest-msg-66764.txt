I went from 512mb DDR to 1024mb DDR and Zone times,camping,lag Still hasn't
improved much.I'm running AMD 1900+ XP,Gforce3,Windows XP and Have Cable for
ISP.Luckly,I'm an adult with the income to support this.My question is how
are the younger players going to upgrade or the average guy or girl,Who
doesn't want to spend a small fortune to simply play a game?It doesn't seem
right,to exclude the main stream.
