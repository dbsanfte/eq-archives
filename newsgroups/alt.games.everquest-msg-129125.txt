You would be surprised at the intricacies that go into such a combined
operation if you could see it from the inside.  Actually, it's amazing
that it works as well as it does.  And the fact that it DOES work, is
a tribute to the skill, dedication and loyalty of patriotic americans
doing their duty.

Having said that, I agree with you.  It DOES look bad.  We CAN NOT, we
MUST NOT let it happen.  

But it pales in comparison to the monstrosity of those who would
specifically engineer the killing of innocent civilians.  Or the
corrupt and barbaric who would think that such targeting is "morally
justified".
