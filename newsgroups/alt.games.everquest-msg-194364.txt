Since someone brought this up, I'll ask my own related question.  Is there
any similar mechanism that would prevent messages from someone from
showing up in Pine?  I never saw a post by that End Times Prophet guy
until I started using Gravity.  And since I don't know how to plonk in
Pine, I couldn't have done anything to make him not show up.
