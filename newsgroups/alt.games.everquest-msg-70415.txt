PCI will really limit what you can use because, as you stated, most are AGP
based.

I still stand by the Prophet 4XXX series from Hercules.

You can get a Prophet 4000 that is PCI based, has 32MB of RAM and runs EQ with
pretty decent performance.  They are about $80 Canadian, so they're probably
about $50 USD.

Good luck!
