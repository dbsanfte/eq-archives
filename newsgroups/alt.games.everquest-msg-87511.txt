    Of course. Any time I auction a Serp Bracer I'm hoping the guy at the
other end is a moron who'll offer me something above vendor price for it!

    Note: this from the fellow who recently gave me all his stuff on his
mules to sell for him while he went off, had fun and made level 56. Way to
haggle, Dan! *mischievous grin*

    The problem is, many people who say "offer" WANT you to make a silly
offer. I've run into very few people who've said "whoa, tiger, that's WAY
too much money for what I'm selling - I'll give it to you for this". And
nobody wants to make a deal and find out later they were taken - they feel
embarassed way out of proportion to how embarassed they should feel.

    I'd love to see how to guarantee that the bidders can pay in EQ. Maybe
have a new quest NPC in Temple of Sol Ro, "Bud the Collector". "You need me
to [break some kneecaps]? It'll cost yas."

    Those car dealerships are chumps. We tried it a long time ago, but every
car dealership around us scouted our prices and advertised that they would
specifically beat our price. The salesmen didn't like the low grosses, and
also couldn't be motivated to sell the stuff you need a tetanus shot to look
at (which also generates the most heat, is the hardest sell, etc.) without
selling things from that end of the lot at a good loss once spiffs were
included. Not a good way to run a business that is, by its nature, low
volume.
