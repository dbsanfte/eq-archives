I know exactly why. You adjusted the PCI texture memory, under
additional properties, direct x, in your nvidia desktop settings. I
had the exact same problem. Your problem is partially that you have
WAY too little ram so by default enough is not left for your tnt 16
meg, which now requires more in EQ inventory.

When you ? mouse over the PCI texture mem setting in the nvidia
desktop properties, it tells you that it does nothing on an AGP card
and that it only works for PCI mode. Well, either EQ runs in PCI
compatible mode or the tnt 16 meg is since it has such low ram. Either
way, it needs to be higher so you stop pausing in inventory.

1) Do like I did, get the newest driver from www.nvidia.com, the
28.32, works great with EQ

2) go to control panel and uninstall nvidia. Click cancel when it says
to reboot. Instead, hold down shift and hit Start/then quit, then
highlight restart and hit to restart while holding down shift, that
soft reboots.

3) upon soft rebooting windows will try to look for a graphics card.
hit "all cards" then go to that top one, default or whatever, PCI VGA.
Soft reboot again instead of restarting when windows wants to.

4) NOW, when you are back in windows with the PCI VGA windows driver
(THIS IS IMPORTANT, or it could mess up the nvidia install) THEN
install the 28.32 drivers (errr actually before doing this use
regedit.exe and search for nvidia, delete all "nvidia/nvidia
corperation" etc keys... when you have that pci vga driver in use)

5) restart or soft restart.

6) NOW go into desktop properties, settings, nvidia whatever,
additional properties, directX see what it set that PCI texture memory
at. It probably is WAY too low since you have 160 meg ram (you need a
MINIMUM of 256 meg now, even for NON LUCLIN OLD EQ MODELS) Try to set
it at least at 32 meg anyway,

7) now get in EQ and that inventory slow down might be gone, really
though you don't have enough system ram. 

I had 384 meg of ram with all luclin models and tnt 16 meg agp.
Having luclin DOES NOT MATTER, its the direct X 8.1 ENGINE upgrade,
which is EVERQUEST WIDE no matter what which made the performance hit.
I always set my pci texture mem at the lowest possible, like 1, since
it says it does nothing in AGP. However, IT LIES. I had the same
problem as you, inventory/selling graphics lag.. it slowed down my
mouse TO A CRAWL. THEN, as above, I reinstalled my drivers and let
THEM set everything to the default. I noticed they had set my pci
texture memory under direct X to 48 meg of ram. I got in EQ and...

I HAD ZERO GRAPHICS LAG IN INVENTORY.

Just to make sure, I then switched it back to the 1 I had it at
previously, got in EQ, GRAPHICS LAG IN INVENTORY. I then set it back
to the 48 meg, got in EQ, NO GRAPHICS LAG IN INVENTORY.

For xmas I asked for another 256 meg dimm JUST like the one I'd put in
when I got luclin to give me 384 meg ram. I now have 576 meg ram and
the default setting it put the texture mem at was 61 meg. Once again,
ZERO LAG IN GRAPHICS inventory. I again tryed moving it to the bottom,
got back in EQ, LAG in graphics inventory. I set it back at 61 meg, no
lag.

Your problem is that it sets that automatically according to the spare
RAM you have. Since you only have 160 meg of ram, its probably setting
it at the bottom. For whatever reason, the way the inventory graphics
display it makes use of that pci texture memory setting EVEN if you
have an AGP card. 

So set that puppy at 32 meg or so and if you are even ABLE to get into
EQ after that, your inventory lag should be gone.

My further recommendations are this, I have a p2 333 proc.. so its a
bit like yours. I overclocked it to 400 mhz and its been at that for
TWO YEARS with zero problems. The best bonus of this is that then your
FSB can be at 100 mhz instead of 66 (350 or above does that) My ram is
100 mhz or above (some is 133, but they all run at 100, ram is
backwards compatible in that way) So I recommend you get out your
mboard manual at LEAST oc your celeron proc to 350 or 400. You can
pretty much tell if win 98 can handle it RIGHT away. I set mine to
350, fine, then 400. I then tried 450 and at 450 I got in windows okay
but then when I moved the mouse and opened some folders I locked up.
400 has been fine for two years, as I said. It tests as a 400 mhz
compareable CPU in benchmarks also.

Next, I'd find out what dimms your motherboard can handle. Probably
256 meg SDRAM is the largest you can handle at 100 mhz. Don't worry
about the 100 mhz though, its backwards compatible like I said and
standard 256 meg sdram 133 mhz should be fine. I'd get TWO of those.
They are about 30 bucks each sometimes to upwards of 55 I think.
You'd then be even playing LUCLIN MODELS (if you had luclin) FINE with
low textures, since I had pretty much the same system. 

The final thing I'd do is like I JUST DID finally after 3 years of EQ.
I broke down and upgraded my graphics card when I saw an MSI
(microstar) Nvidia Geforce 2 mx 400, 64 meg card for 45 bucks at an
outlet place near me (brand new card) That is pretty much what a
THIRTY TWO meg geforce costs at places like Best Buy (best buy my
ass...) The difference in EQ is pretty damn HUGE. I still have it set
at low textures with luclin models (the texture setting is one of the
biggest wasters of mem, and low is not much worse than high or
medium), all animations on, all luclin models but now I also have 3d
affects on and double 3d sky. I had not seen 3d affects or spell
affects in about 3 years since it lagged my tnt so much, so I'm having
fun now ; ) Besides no spell casting graphics lag, I have WAY less lag
when passing other people with luclin models. I bet if I tried the old
models again I'd move like a bat out of hell.

SO, with a system similar to yours my total upgrade cost:

1) 30 bucks for a 256 meg pc 133 dimm (found that in change on my
floor)

2) another 256 meg pc 133 dimm of same type from same place for xmas
(free for me, giggle

3) setting my vcache to a max of 95 meg to overcome the 95/ME/98
windows max discache mem error (eq makes the vcache huge ass otherwise
if you have 512 meg ram or more) (FREE!)

4) using cacheman, to possibly get some boost but more over to see
what mem is being used and how much of my page file. Also set page
file to min max of 700 meg.  FREE for personal use

5) geforce 2 64 meg brand new card at some outlet place here, 45
bucks.

So for 75 bucks I'm playing pretty well now until games like Star wars
galaxies and EQ2 come out which REQUIRE a full geforce 3 or 4 (4200,
4400 or 4600) for the pixel and vertex shading and such. That will be
6 months or more away though. By that time 4200 geforce 4s should be
out for 175 bucks or less. My next upgrade is that card, a
celeron/amd/p3 or 4 of 1 ghz or more, new mboard that can use my pci
256 dimm sdram (I know that the newest AMD procs can still do so on
some motherboards and that ram speed makes VERY little difference in
performance of 3d texture intensive games. The AMOUNT of ram matters
far more)
