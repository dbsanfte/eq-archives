    Do the quest twice, get both. If you can find people to do the combines
for one set of items, you can take the time to gather the ingredients for a
second earring at the same time. Unless you're already doing high-end raids,
or got lucky in Cazic Thule, you aren't going to find better earrings for
quite some time.
