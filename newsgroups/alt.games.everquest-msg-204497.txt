Crowding hasn't been too bad at all.  At the very beginning the newbie
zones were pretty crowded for a week or so.  And PC is probably still
very popular (a fair number of folks seem to change their minds about
what class/race to play, or maybe they just like life in the zoo, who
knows?).  Personally, I'm glad they put the tag on the server.  It's
been fun running into the occasional true newbie.
