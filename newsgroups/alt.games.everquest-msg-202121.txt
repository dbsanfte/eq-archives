One other problem about judging guild by web pages...my guild updates its
home page maybe weekly, but that is just some major news.  However, all our
raiding information is kept under a locked member section.  Many guilds do
this so as to not lose opportunities to raid mobs that pop at certain times.
I wouldn't say my guild is that secretive about it, but the information
about what we are doing is certainly not being broadcasted zonewide.  My
guild raids once or twice a week.  Sometimes our raids will be to help
people finish quests, sometimes to kill mobs like dragons, doomshade, rhags,
etc...Some of our goals are to get our VP keys...we are a smaller guild so
this is an appropriate step for us as VP is rather under used.  Anyhow, your
question made me think about how people join guilds.  I joined my guild
because i had a friend in it, who joined it back when it first started.  I
guess if you wanted to kill vindi you would hang around Kael and see what
guild was killing him, if you are more interested in elemental stuff, then
hang around those planar entrances and see what guilds are going into them
:p
