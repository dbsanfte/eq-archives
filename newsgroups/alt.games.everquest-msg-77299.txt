I alos had a high level Chanter tell me it helps with lowering fizzle rate,
or is that basically the same thing as casting
same spell with a higher level caster? Not counting the basic skill check
ofcourse.
The same chanter told me it also helps with skillgain chance, so i set out
to test it with the 2 skills i  did not at the moment
have maxed out, swimming and fishing. From my very unscientific test i swam
around for about 15 minutes and gained 13 points
of swimming skill with the spell cast upon me and 2 points gained without
it. For fishing i gained 4 points in the same time
as i had gained 0 points without the spell.
