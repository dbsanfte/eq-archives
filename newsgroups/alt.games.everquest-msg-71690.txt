Broadband.  With broadband achieving fairly widespread use, people are
using email and instant messages as a replacement for the telephone.
It is becoming less and less acceptable for a game to insist that you
not recieve email or ICQ/AOL/etc messages while playing.

Right.  What they could do, though, would be add commands that let us
set up hotkeys to memorize sets of spells, so that we could switch
spells with a hotkey.  Make it take the same time as it normally
takes, so that it won't unbalance things.
