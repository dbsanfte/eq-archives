You play a druid, correct?  OT is a great spot for druids, lots of animals,
and with wolf form nothing is KOS except the cockatrices, sarnaks, and
'goons.  Charm a sabertooth tiger and watch it eat rhinos.  Use the druid's
pet-only buff line and watch your kill rate soar.  Better yet, partner with
an enchanter and let him/her do the charming and hasting while you pull and
get insane experience.  Also, on my server (Rathe) OT is rarely
overpopulated and in fact is usually empty, although that could be a
function of the time at which I normally play.
