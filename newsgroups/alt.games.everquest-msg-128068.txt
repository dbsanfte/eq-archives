When your group mate says run, you run.  Discuss it afterwards.

What if he's seen a red con mob coming that you've missed?  Death
comes quickly in many EQ zones, where you are happily hunting
mobs around your level but on rare occaision something 30 levels
higher strolls by cleaning up the inattentive.

At your level, death is a joke, pure and simple.  Essentially you gate
back to your bind point and get mana refreshed, at the cost of having
to mem spells again.

But its not good to learn that lesson too well.  Soon enough, and your
friend was already there, you will end up naked far from your body,
and having lost far more experience than killing that one more mob
could have given you.

Grouping means sharing judgement calls.  When you stay and he runs,
then the mob that the two of you could maybe take becomes one that
you have to solo... and you see how that worked out.  If he stands there
screaming at you to start running, he can get beat down to the point where

running is impossible for him too.

Now once you start running, you might want to ask why... if he's
misunderstood
the situation, and agrees to come back, you often can finish the mob off
after all,
quite often that bit of running you did when you didnt' have to is nothing
more than
a slight delay in figthing.

Your friend misidentified the mob, but having done so acted pretty well.
He didn't
just cut and run and hang you out to dry, he told you to run too (when you
would
have made a lovely speed bump for the mob) and then hung around to Snare
it too, which pretty much guaranteed that you could run if you had the
sense to.

You won't find many perfect players at your level, even experienced EQ
players
are learning a new class, and likely a new area, and are having to unlearn
some
habits that dont' apply at the lowest levels... like the idea that Red
mobs don't mean
death, but often instead are the best exp you can get.  We forget being
shocked when
we can no longer efficiently solo reds as the color code system gradually
moves
from "fun to solo" to "hard to solo" to "you want a group for this"...
back at "hey,
there's a Red, lets get it" levels sometimes you see more cowardice from
the
repeat offenders than from the real newbies.
