Actually what I meant was people doing from 20-65 in one place and 
seeing nothing whatsoever of the rest of the game. A friend and his 
friends actually have done this. They know one area of the game and 
nothing else. No way I can convince them to go anywhere other than 
their LDoN missions... To use your own words, this is not only "hardly 
huge excitement", but mind numbing.

That is not what a MMOG is supposed to be.
