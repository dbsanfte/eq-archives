I'm sure tracking is useful in dungeons at times--particularly when you want
to know if a certain mob has spawned or not.

Also, did you know that you can turn the gnoll fangs in to the trainer at
the Warrior guild in Qeynos?  (btw--Qeynos spelled backwards is Sony EQ)He's
in the PVP arena.  do a /shout and someone should be able to help you find
him.  he gives xp, gold, and a moonstone.  you can then turn that into
another guy in qeynos at a bar, and he'll give more xp and an alcoholic
drink.

these are good low-level quests!

here's the full description from EQLizer:

"This quest will take you to the Qeynos Hills or Black Burrow. Some of the
gnolls there will drop gnoll fangs. Return these fangs to the Captain in
Qeynos and you will receive a faction adjustment, a moonstone and a decent
chunk of experience at low levels. This is a great way to gain experience at
lower levels. Hunt in Black Burrow(your probably going to be anyway) and
collect a large amount of fangs. You can reduce your leveling time by more
than 100% using this quest.

You can then take the moonstones to McNeal Jocub in Fish's Ale(he's in the
back room). Hand him moonstones and you will receive some booze, some more
faction and a bit more experience(though not nearly as much as for turning
in the gnoll fangs). You can sell the booze right back to him to make a
little profit."
