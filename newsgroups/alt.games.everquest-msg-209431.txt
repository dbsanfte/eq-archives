I can see your problem clearly now.  You're one of those gimps who
refuses to spend an extra hour or two assembling a "perfect" group.
I mean, how can you maximize your xp/minute if you're not willing
to take the time to make an ass of yourself by giving the cold

for leetubermoron37 to finish cybering with manginaguildleader53?
Sheesh, some people...
