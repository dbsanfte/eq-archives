I was sent to the Bittorrent site to download the program, the AO site 
itself just had a .torrent file on it.  I'm guessing that means I could 
have used any bittorrent program I liked.

Course I didn't know anything about the issue until after I was already 
several hours in to the download, and still don't know if the program I 
have is doing worse than it should, so I just let the damn thing run.

22 hours later I'm at 93%.  I've downloaded 761.5M while uploading 
1376.5M... sounds, from what you are saying, that I could have throttled 
my upload rate down to where the two were about even?
