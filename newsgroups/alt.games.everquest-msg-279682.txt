Meditate on beastlords are capped at 185 until you reach level 51+
AFAIK you get +5 cap per level so at 51 it's 190.  Max is 235 at level
65+

To fix it, get a group and work on leveling up some more.  You should
be able to get decent xp in The Deep if you can get a healer and a
tank along.  The Deep is usually empty zone so it should be easy to
get anything done.  And keep a certain no drop item off a named
shroom, it is one of the 4 items you need for beast epic 1.0
