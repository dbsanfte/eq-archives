Yeah, it works like this:

If 3 people in daoc have the quest to get an ant leg, they then all
three in a group go kill an ant. The first ant they kill puts an ant
leg in each of their inventories (no need to loot even when its for a
quest.. it always will have it and it always goes in your inven
directly ;)  )  Now if only 2 of them had the quest, it would only go
in the inventory of those 2 with the quest.

Really that is a much better and more fair way of doing it. It assumes
that your stalwart band of adventurers can go and kill a large ant and
cut off its leg, unlike EQ where it would often not have the quest
thing and if it does only one and everyone wants it and rolls on it or
junk.

DAOC seems to be more set up for Massively Multiplayer. EQ is more set
up for 200 people to be playing on the server at once as long as they
are all not doing the same thing.
