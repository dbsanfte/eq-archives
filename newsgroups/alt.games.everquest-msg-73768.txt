For that matter, how is it that my Paladin can learn how to resurect someone
for 90 or 96% XP (haven't gotten that far, so I'm not sure which), but still
can't quite figure out how to bind, which any level 12 caster can do.
Anyways, it comes down to the fact that binding was always a major nuisance,
and now that's mostly fixed.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
