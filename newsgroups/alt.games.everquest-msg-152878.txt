Well if the corpse has not been looted and its an open pick up, I don't see
any reason they have the right to speak out. Unless its on a raid situation
or something that might require more time to decided who get what loot off
the body. Otherwise the protected timer allows everyone to loot it after a
certain lenght of time. So if they dont want it, why let it rot? Don't worry
about it. You asked them if you should return the loot and that was the
right thing to do, but also not needed! Otherwise the GM would have
requested that you return it!
