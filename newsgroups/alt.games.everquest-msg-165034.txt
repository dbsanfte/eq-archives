Jboots are better because they are insta cast.  Also, druids can sow outside
a dungeon and then enter and keep the sow for 36 min.  Bards try that and
selos ends in 18 seconds (or 2.5 min above L49).  For chant kiting they are
preferable to selos because selos is *too* fast.  They definitely were worth
getting.  I don't use them now I have run3, but if/when I start raiding
serious I might need them again as a junk buff.
