Research is ridiculously simple to keep maxed out.  Every level your research
cap goes up by five.  By sheer coincedence, you also get 5 practice points every
level.

Since there's no reason to buy research skill, for most classes, prior to level
24, you get 24 points for the first one you spend.  Spending points up to cap
still leaves you a few left over for 1 in med, 1 in each generalization, one in
every trade skill, and heck, a few languages or something if you like.

Every level there after, put 5 more points in to research, unless there is
another new skill for that level (a very rare occurance for non melee classes)

Now sadly, to research a 24 spell you really ought to have a 28th+ researcher do
the job, and so forth... but thats a whole other nightmare.  My point is, the
skill itself is trivial to get and maintain, unlike any trade skill you might
wish to name.
