Also if you turn on auto attack, auto fire turns off and wont come
back on if you stop attack so you will need to restart auto fire as
needed.

Autofire command works for any classes that can throw, not just those
that can use bow.  My Beastlord has maxed throwing skill and when I
run into mob in raid that are ranged only, I just use auto attack and
sit back and relax.
