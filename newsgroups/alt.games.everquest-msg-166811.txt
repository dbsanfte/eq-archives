You seem to have forgotten meditation.

A tick is 6 seconds, so if you regen R per tick, that is 4000/R/10 minutes.

Meditiation will give about 25 mana/tick, so let's say you are doing 37
tick.  That gives 4000/37/10 minutes = 10 minutes, 49 seconds.

That's 20 seconds of casting Harvest.  Note that 10:49 + 20 = 11:09, which
is spookily close to your measured med time.
