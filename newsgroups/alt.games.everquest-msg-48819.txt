 My two cents: AC in SRO is a completely random spawn. Every single person 
I know including myself had the AC spawn right on top of him while passing
through a nearly empty zone. I zoned into SRO one night to run to Oasis,
ran up the hill before the Oasis zone and sat to mem a few different spells.
When I was done I stood up and there he was. One other level 18ish guy in
the zone came up and congratulated me on the kill. There was what looked 
like a full spawn of the normal creatures at the time and I assume nobody
had done anything special before i got there.
 
 It's completely random, you simply have to get lucky in SRO.
 
 I had just went and bought Tboots 4 days earlier. Maybe that's what 
triggered it, who knows. <shakes fist at Verant>
