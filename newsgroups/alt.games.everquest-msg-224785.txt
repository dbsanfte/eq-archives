*room full of drooling people*

Rastus stands: "Hi, my name is Rastus and I am a nutcase"

*polite clapping*

Well, most people here, myself included, are aware of my terrible faction in
the Plane of Sanity - but today is crunch time. At work here at UQ I was
sent to a consulting Psychaitrist whose medico-legal opinion determines
whether I continue working full time or get classified as medically unfit
and put out to pasture on a pension...

: (

I have a meeting in half an hour with the Universities Director of Personell
where I find out what the report recommended... *continues chewing nails*
... Hopefully in the near future I will not have a new found ample supply of
extra time to spend in EQ as I cannot even begin to imagine a life without
the anchor of a decent job.

To quote the ever classy Four Weddings and a Funeral: "Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck
Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck ..."
