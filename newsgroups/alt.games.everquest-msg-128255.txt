In article <3D25C42C.A8AA2743@cox.net>, lenny13@cox.net says...

You can also hunt the orcs just inside HHP from Kith and turn in the 
scalps. Killing the orcs makes the HP guards and Kith residents like you 
more, turning in the scalps they drop makes the following people like 
you: corrupt qeynos guards, freeport militia, highpass guards, highpass 
merchants, and carson mccabe.  No negative faction hits.  In fact when 
fighting orcs we'd often have someone wander in and ask if they could 
'share the faction' - ie, take one bare-fisted swing at each orc we 
fought.  My DE skipped up a couple of levels while I levelled on the 
orcs (and with a decent group you'll burn through the orcs, even with 
all the adds - plus of course you get a very slim chance of picking up a 
shiny brass idol - which I won a roll for, yay :D)

Then... when you hit level 20 or so (NOT under, at least on my server 
they'll just laugh at you and tell you to go back to orcs - yeah, those 
things that are now light blue, meh, I went back to oasis for a level), 
and the residents like you enough not to bother you, go into HHK and get 
into a group hunting goblins.  Get the left ears of the goblins and turn 
those in.  Highpass guards, carson mccabe, merchants of highpass, 
corrupt qeynos guards, and freeport militia all like you more for those 
ears, as well as for killing the gobbies.  And the gobbies themselves 
are *excellent* experience.  I'm going up about a level a day, even with 
work interfering, fighting them.  And I'm amiable to the highpass guards 
now.  Can't tell you re: qeynos guards as I haven't been to Qey yet.  
Merchants are still dubious though, no idea why they're so stubborn :)
