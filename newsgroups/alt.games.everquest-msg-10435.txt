The spell that did not take hold means that the target allready had a simular spell on it that
the spell you cast dose not stac with.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the gun. While
this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the
mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and
stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."

--Thomas Jefferson
