Soloing IGs in Everfrost  will net you about 100 - 150 plat an HOUR if you can
get a camp, and you'll get ex from it.

Killing certain  Dorfs in BB will get you no ex, about 3 - 500 plat a day. 
Careful though. Kill only those that will take a hot on Citizens of Kaladim
faction, not the guards.  Even then there are two vendors in zone with whom you
can do business.
