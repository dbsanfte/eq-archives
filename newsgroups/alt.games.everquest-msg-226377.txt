55 was never a hell level.
51, 54, 59 were very much so before the patch to smooth it out. I
think a quirk in LDoN mob xp makes 55 and up difficult may be what you
are refering to. 55 still goes faster than 54 in non-LDoN situations.
Although personaly I always saw 51-59 as all being hell levels cause
things got so damn boring. Better was 60-65 but not by much.
