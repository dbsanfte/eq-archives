Actually, while interesting, that statistic doesn't speak to the claim I 
made. I asserted kids smoked and drank 'first', not that they stuck with 
it. Another unrelated but interesting statistic is the quantity 
consumed... the cigarette smokers tend to burn through far more 
cigarettes than marijuana users.

Interestingly, marijuana is almost more available to kids than 
cigarettes are... in either case kids have to work through someone else, 
and everybody in the schoolyard knows who deals.

But even so, I've previously conceded that marijuana is a bit 'special', 
and your stats just prove the point.

In an 'absolute price' context. The absolute price of a pack, with all 
taxes in, is still pocket change. There's not enough markup over the 
costs (and legal risks) to justify it.

You can't successfuly ban something the majority actually wants. This is 
where Marijuana is making inroads... society largely tolerates it, and 
the naysayers fail to give truly compelling reasons for it to be banned.

Heroin & Cocain on the other hand... not so much.
