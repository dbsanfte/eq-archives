He got the book on the third morning. Yesterday, I escorted the frog to 
Shadowhaven, and then the wizard and my necro killed and were killed in 
Ahkeva to get those drops there. I've handed the drops to the frog, and 
he will find some friends for the final turn in and murder scene at some 
point this weekend.

So it has gotten better. Unless of course the murder goes awry. At which 
point, Jazz will drink more scotch. And he doesn't like scotch either.
