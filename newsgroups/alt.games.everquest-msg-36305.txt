    Might as well start the thread now - what content have you noticed
in-game that's in anticipation of SoL's release? Things like Vah Shir usable
armour and gear, BST gear - that sort of thing.

    My contribution to start things off is the faction group for either the
troll or ogre BST guild - Primordial Malice. You can already raise this
faction by killing Dorn in NRo. I believe that this is the faction for one
of those two guilds, and not some other group, because of the original quest
that Dorn is involved with (and if I had time to look up the eventual end of
the quest, I'd tell you exactly which, too). Note that IF this is the troll
BST guild, and IF the troll BST guild has a "bring me stacks of this" newbie
quest with faction raises, then this could be the long-lost route to getting
non-KOS in Grobb.
