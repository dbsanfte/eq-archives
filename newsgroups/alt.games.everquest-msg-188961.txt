  I see myself as overcoming this in the end, possibly on the final day =

  Basically I see some kind of a major social revolution coming or =
starting in 3 years, whereupon one smaller group of people controls the =
larger group. I think that in this new world however the smaller group =
will actually care about the welfare of the larger group.

  I also think that I could have a place in the smaller group, but not =
as I am right now. I get the feeling that my future may be in doubt and =
that I could end up in the larger group, but there are people, past =
friends of mine who would like to see me in this elite group but =
currently I am too prideful, envious, lustful, slothful (this is the one =
that will end me in hell, this is my deadly sin), angry, and gluttonous. =
The only one of the 7 deadly sins I don't have is greed, and I have =
learned that it is actually good to be a little greedy for money, and =
that being poor is evil and I would have to agree.=20

  So basically I have 3 years to become a decent human being saved by =
God or rightfully spend an eternity in Hell as there is no way anyone =
would want me around in Heaven as I am now.=20

  I can tell that God is after me and will do absolutely anything to try =
and herd me down the right path. When the end comes, it will be seen =
that I had absolutely every opportunity imaginable and either I will =
have failed or succeeded. I can also tell that only a few questionable =
people like me still remain and that this 3 year period should be used =
to try and save these people and everyone else who has not been exposed =
to God's plan for their lives. I would say that the people who have been =
exposed to Christianity all their lives and have rejected it will need =
to go through their final chance to repent which is the "shock and awe" =
portion of the show. We are currently in the occasional snowstorm, =
earthquake, famine mode which isn't too bad.

  I think there are still 3 years left, but I don't know that for sure, =
no one can know the time or date of Christ's return, I think everything =
I have done ultimately is meant to communicate that he is coming very =
soon.    =20
