I agree.  I guess it depends on what sense of the word rogue is used, but if
you consider them thieves and scoundrels, then they should be the perfect
solo character.  The whole concept of hiding and sneaking implies acting
alone.  But, hey, we aren't exactly talking reality here.  How many people
do you know that can cast even the simplest fireball, with only their mind?
Sony/Verant got it wrong.  Big whoop.
