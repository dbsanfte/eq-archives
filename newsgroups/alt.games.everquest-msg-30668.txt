It's a trust issue, for the most part, I think.  With people I know we use it
lots, usually having the Rogue master so they can pickpocket with ease and
still do an even cash split in the end.  With strangers, though, you never know
if they're skimming off the top or not.  Or if they'll just mysteriously go LD
when it's time to split.  Might not be much in, say, Unrest or even Karnor's,
but when you're talking Hill Giants and frogs, it can really add up.

And for the MLer, it's both hassle and weight.  Anyone who doesn't have to med
is a prime candidate for MLing, but my warrior is an elf and always bordering
on encumberance--she *can* master loot, but she lets it be known she's going to
be dropping or destroying all copper out of necessity.
