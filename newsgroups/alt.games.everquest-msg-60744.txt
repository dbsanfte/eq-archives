Kael is completely trivial if you are invis.  No giants along the
transit route see invis, and if someone is pulling see-invis giants to
the main path, they've either cleared everything else or are going to
die due to their own stupidity.  Once you zone out of Kael into WL,
refresh your invis and follow the wall north, then follow the north
wall all the way across the zone.  Wave at the nice dragon (not
Wuoshi, the other one), get to the west wall, go south a bit, zone
into SS.  Hope that someone in SS has a key to get you out of the zone
into CS, if not, just wait, people pass through regularly.
You zone into a safe spot in CS, so you can refresh your invis and
sow, then just follow the snowy ridge to the end where the dragon
circle is.  Pick up your key and don't get run over by the folks
quad-kiting.

Arolpin
finally possesses a SS key, so all of Velious is convenient
