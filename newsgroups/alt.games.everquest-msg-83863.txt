  VI kicked out cash?  Hardly.  I'd like to see some of it.  I really
could use it after the money I was forced to spend to upgrade my
system to continue playing EQ, and after the month of time during
which I either couldn't play, or could only play with unpleasant
restrictions (i.e., not being able to function in certain zones
because the frame rates made them so horrible.)  I would have
appreciated anything that indicated Verant really cared.  Free
experience?  Fine, I'm sure it wouldn't require a lot of effort on
their behalf to make it so, but it would at least have done SOMETHING
to repay us for the hours of grief their incompetence resulted in.
Instead they don't even give us that insignificant nod.  They only
gave us words.

  I'm sure they spent some money trying to resolve the issues, but if
they hadn't, they would have lost a ton of revenue from people like me
who simply would have stopped playing because the game was unplayable.
Fixing fundamental flaws in their game is not something that I am
inclined to jump up and praise Verant for.  It's something I think I
have a right to expect, being a paying customer.

  Anything they do above and beyond keeping the game playable is just
"nice."  Nice would be a credit to our account for outages.  Or a
small amount of "free" experience.  Or perhaps kicking their CS staff
in to overdrive for a month to run special events.  Anything to prove
they "care".  Even better would have been a letter from the producer s
aying they would be implementing procedures to see to it that such a
bug-ridden release would never be foisted upon their playerbase again.

  Instead, we see none of that.  Mythic appears willing to compensate
their customers in at least some small way for the problems they
introduce, without worrying that "Oh, horror of horrors, some players
might get experience they don't 'deserve'."
