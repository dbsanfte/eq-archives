The wyverns are dark blue, but they're all KoS to me. That wouldn't be 
so bad except that a Drake flew out of nowhere and killed me in like 
three hits (despite a similar dark blue con).

At the advice of another I am killing giants in the Great Divide in an 
attempt to change my faction with the wyverns.

Spirocs gave decent exp, but man do they have a lot of hp lol. Silly 
little birds take all my mana and then some just to kill four on a quad.
