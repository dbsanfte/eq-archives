Mine had to be the day my chanter hit level 12 and scraped together enough
cash to get his charm spell.

I had seen a High level chanter a few weeks back and she had charmed a dwarf
Npc, and the damage it was kicking out shocked me (hasted as well) so just I
had to try it.

I was hanging out in Gfay at the time and after trying it out on a few
passing wasps and orcs I was feeling pretty disapointed.

Why had I spent almost 2 weeks getting to 12 (This was back before luclin
and when I still thought anyone over 20 was a god) only to have a critter
thats even more feeble than my animation and feels the need to whack on me
every few minutes, I was all for deleting the toon UNTIL a wisp happened by,
I figured ah what the hell, it was a blue con to me might be a bit risky if
it breaks but i'll give it a shot.

Well I was still new to the game, I knew Wisp had to be hit with magic
weapons (a rather painful lesson involving me, No mana, and a cracked staff)
but I figured all mobs had magic attacks right ?

Hell No, Gfay orcs cant hit magic critters, using the same wisp I killed
every single orc on orc hill 5 times over, and filled my back packs with CB
Belts !!!

I felt like a god, at one time My little pet had 6 orcs trying to beat on
him, I laughed so hard I almost wet myself =)

That had to be my best EQ day yet ...
