a warrior may be able, in theory, to be defensive 3/5ths of the time, but 
that doesn't take into account that there's a stamina drain

it's possible that with low-end (velious) gear, your warriors will not be 
able to keep up defensive this way

grats, btw =D




and lance, i recognize that you are serious in your critiques of the 
classes, but SK gets FD - stop forgetting that =)~ that's a [mostly selfish] 
convenience that adds up to a lot, even if it takes away from tankability 
... as i'm sure you know...

i've enjoyed my warrior (with crap gear) to 68 much more than my two 
shadowknights to mid 40's / low 50's...grass's always greener, no?
