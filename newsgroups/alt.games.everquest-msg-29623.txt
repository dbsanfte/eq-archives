I would like to create a character to play for the Evil Side (probably dark
elf) who can take care of himself in some PvP combat but would also do well in
a group.. What am I looking for here?  Can an enchanter survive in one on one
PvP?  The enchanter I played to 12 on Xev didn't do well solo as I remember.  I
know a Necromancer kicks ass PvP one on one, but what about in a hunting group?
 I love Clerics, how can they possibly fight PvP though?  Wizard?  Mage? 
Ideas? :)
