well not everyone.  Clearly your argument cuts both ways.

The same "everyone" you allude to were saying that cat expressions were only
used for brave and fearless descriptions and not one existed for cowardice.
I expect the person conveniently or otherwise forgot about what they called
wimps when they were very young.

It's a more direct and simple route for the word to have derived from pussy
as used for cat.  It can be shown to have been used for cowardice well
before it's use for vagina.  One citation I saw was The ANatomie of Abuses -
1580 [circa].

There was no authority issued, I find it odd you'd read it that way.

I'd hardly think that for the majority of English speaking people that it
does.  For starters how long has "pussy" actually been used in common slang
to mean vagina?  It's advent as day to day speech for vagina came about with
magazines such as Playboy, but predominantly Hustler - sure it was used
before then, but not nearly as commonly.   So you get a split in age groups,
secondly, the US hardly constitutes the majority of English speaking people,
you'd want to do a survey in a large number of countries before you came to
that conclusion.


Pussy to mean a weak man originated when pussy as a term of endearment
originated.  The term used as an endearment can be seen in Uncle Tom's Cabin
(cite that if you like), its publication predates the date ascribed to pussy
for vagina.

Now you can refuse to accept that, it is your right it does not make you
right, nor does it give you or anyone else the right to accuse someone using
it to describe cowardice or weakness as being sexist.  Those who choose to
have it signify sexism do so out of ignorance or because of a wish to have
something to react against or to be offended by.


As an aside, I managed to tame one who had been a house cat go ferile.  He
certainly knew what was a convenient meal size, but he had the rest of the
family to provide for as well - not a shred or timidity in that cat, but he
never once scratched or bit me (unfortunately a couple of friends can't say
that).

I gave my reasons for not agreeing with the single citation provided.   It
is not in anyway authoritive and the credentials of the author can not be
checked. I showed errors in the article's second point.  The article did not
directly say that pussy for weak derived from its use for vagina.
Furthermore, it is not unreasonable to expect that a gay magazine would have
a bias in this - wimp being the direct example at hand, either deliberately
or unintentionally.

So no, I did not ignore that citation.  However,  I did show it to be
worthless.

not everyone else.

No connection has been shown.

There was one attempt at a citation from a gay magazine.  The only other
thing which came close to being a presentation of sources, were some
dictionary meanngs and the "argument" put forward was that because pussy =
vagina was listed as number 2, then of course it was more important this way
than where it figured further down the list for coward.  Apart from being a
completely flawed argument, if one was to follow it, the you'd have to
accept that the definition labelled 1. supercedes that of 2. and hence by
its own logic is irrelevant.

Agreed, it could mean this.  Furthermore, something which I disagree with is
not a lie.  Quoting out of context to convey something which was not said or
meant is dishonest or at best a mistake.  Continuing to do so is a lie, and
this is what happened.

he's not a liar for thinking I am wrong, he's aliar for being dishonest.

Lokari might think so, that would explain some things.

Regardless of rules, it's being rude and highly offensive.  The banning part
has nothing to do with what I am saying, it's something which Lokari and
palindrone resorted to.  I did go to the trouble of finding out what the
actual issue with Blizzard was, ironically if you had typed in "cunt" you
would have been quite ok. Lok and pal. have attempted to argue that I don't
think Blizz has any right to their action.  It's a strawman, and lying.  If
I didn't think such then the reports which I have made for sexist names
would not have been made, now would they?  Simply another example of their
dishonesty.
