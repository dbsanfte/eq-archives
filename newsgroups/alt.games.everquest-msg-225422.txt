There seems to be a major problem with EQ at the moment that is not being
resolved. Along with a great many other people I am also suffering from the
same EQclient crashes, disconnections on zoning and difficulty logging on
from the character select screen. On the occasions when I have been in the
game I find from talking to other people that they are suffering the same
problems. This has been happening for some weeks now and it does not seem to
be being resolved. Nor does there seem to be any indication from EQ that
there is a problem effecting many people at the moment!
