I actually *like* XP.  I've been a fan of NT over DOS-based Windows since 
3.51, and with win2k and XP, it seems to have the majority of the bugs 
worked out.  I still cringe at the hardware requires, but it's not much 
more than my RedHat box for similar performace.  Hell, I play EQ, I can't 
bitch about system requirements for a silly OS.  :)
