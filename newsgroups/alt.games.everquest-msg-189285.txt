You sure its 1 groupable?

The final mob has soooo many HP, it would take a lifetime to kill.  Not to
mention the repops (and their repops, and their repops) in the time it took
to kill.  I guess you could charm a goo for nice DPS, but the fact remains,
a mob hitting for 1kish, with massive HP, in an area with several (4+) mobs
spawn spots, does't inspire much faith :)
