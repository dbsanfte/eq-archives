I'm still laughing so hard I can barely see, but I wanted to share it with
all of you...

So, how about it all you Rangers?  Don't you agree that our little arrows
should do damage that is closer to that of a Sword?  LMAO!

I dunno, maybe I'm the only one that finds that idea ridiculous, but
still...

I Know im going off topic with this and i know im going to get flamed but i
needed a way to get ahold of the Ranger Comunity.

ATTENTION RANGERS! and anyone else that would like to help!
Re: The Archery Skill and you.
Im sure this has been tried before but lets try again. Please all Rangers
that see this email this address mailto:eqmail@soe.sony.com . That is the
Complaint and Comment address for sony verant and i would request that you
would write to them politely requesting that they make our archery skill
better and more usefull like a ranger skill should be.

I believe that the letter should at least contain two things.
1) Ask that our damage done by out archery skill be increased so that it
might come close to being equal to the damage of our main melee skills.
2) [if you want] Ask that we be given the choice to become an archery class
with hand2hand as our seconday attack. A possible way of doing this would
work off of the specialization skill where whichever skill goes over, say
70, first becomes you main attack and the other simply a secondary atttack

Hopefully if we get enough people then Verant will make a change. And i know
that this sound like a radical change but remember sometimes you have to ask
for a big change to get a little change. Also mention this post so that we
can give Verant the impression that we are unified on this idea. THANK ALL!!
