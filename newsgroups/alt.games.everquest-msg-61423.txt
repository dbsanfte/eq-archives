I recently got a Drakkel Icereaver for my Troll SK (given to me by
some kind high level soul). Right after that, my guild went on a raid
and got me a Black Alloy something or other, which is slightly better.
I want to go ahead and sell my Icereaver (unless a Guildy says he
wants it, but no one has stepped forward yet). The problem is, I have
no idea what it's worth. I've been doing a /shout PC on Drakkel
Icereaver in EC (Luclin's trade center) for a week and a half, and no
one seems to know. Or at least, they don't seem to want me to know.
The offers I've gotten so far seem kinda low to me. So, does anyone
know the price of a Drakkel Icereaver on Luclin server? Oh yeah...I
almost forgot to ask what level it procs Ice Rend. Thanks in advance.
