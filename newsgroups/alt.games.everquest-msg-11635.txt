Its dangerous to fear kite the giants since inside the fort there are at
least 12-15 spawns in a small area and they spawn quickly.  If there are
other groups in there keeping the numbers down, you may try it, but I would
advise against it.  Most of the giants range in lvl from low 20's to 27 or
so with occasional saplings in the teens.  The necro may have some trouble
getting spells to stick consistently, so keep that in mind.

Druids tend to kite the giants and draw them out of the fort where the
chance of an add is diminished.  This seems to be effective especially since
the pathing has them run into a wall allowing DOT's to work longer.  Keep in
mind that there are roaming giants outside the fort too, but not as many.

My strategy has been to stay in the NE corner where no giants roam and just
pull them back there.  I play a tank, so it would be different... but if you
can find a tank handy, you can pull constantly there and have very little
downtime.

BTW: been in the fort for the last 5 levels and have had only one forest
loop drop.   Lost the roll too (
