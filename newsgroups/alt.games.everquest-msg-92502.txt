*shrug* they solo as well as a wizard (except quad-kiting...I still haven't
figured out how to get my 45 wiz to) and better than other non-solo classes.
I never said they were as good as druid/necro/mage.  They're probably on par
with monks.

It's been determined by a lot of people that your level and a critter's MR
has a lot more to do with charm/mez than the amount of CHA you have.  I
forget who "they" are who said it, but I do know that I RARELY have trouble
mezzing at level 54...and my CHA is at 125 usually.  When I have charmed
they seemed to last pretty long, though I don't do it much.
