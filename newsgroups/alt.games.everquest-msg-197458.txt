I think that the maps were initially made for ShowEQ (they didn't just
appear out of thin air the day LoY opened... :-), so no surprise that
they don't match up with the default colour scheme.

What works for me is to disable the texture entirely (select Background ->
Texture from the window's menu) and then set the tint colour (again,
Background -> Tint Color) to 20/20/20.  That's dark enough that the
lines are visible, but light enough your crosshair/arrow doesn't
completely disappear.
