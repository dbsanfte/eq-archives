The naval nuclear power program has driven alot of the programs and policies
in the civilian sector.  Naval Reactors is still a large and influeantial
part of the Department of Energy, and former Navy Nukes are a very large
part of the civilian plants.  Also, the way the navy runs nuclear plants has
proven that it can be done safely and effectively.  Without that influence,
the _media_ disaster of TMI would have likely ended the industry.

Order of the Mallet

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
