If you are a human or half elf druid who follows Karana, or a halfling druid
(who MUST follow the Stormlord), I would recommend a few pieces of imbued
Vale armor. Vale (aka hafling cultural) is a leather armor wearable by any
small to medium race able. Imbued, it becomes wearable only by worshippers
of Karana and gives stamina and wisdom. Some pieces are not worth getting
(like the gloves, with 1 WIS and 1 STA; splitpaw gloves with 2 WIS and 3 DEX
are better, imo) but others -- cloak with 2 WIS, 3 STA, 6 AC; boots with 2
WIS, 2 STA, 6 AC and sleeves with 2 WIS, 2 STA, 6 AC  -- are excellent
pieces. The studded armor is (in most cases) the same AC as standard
reinforced leather but weighs less; the reinforced armor has better AC and
is lighter still. If you follow Tunare, then Fier'Dal (aka wood elf
cultural) armor would be your choice: same stats with charisma instead of
stamina.

If you happen to be on Xev, look for Rosewhite Blossom for imbued vale
studded; she would be happy to set you up :-)
