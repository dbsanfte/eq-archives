Its good for the list of spells.

> I always use a pet when not in a group.  Does everyone else?

Yes, unless you are charming undead. The pet is your most powerful weapon
in your arsenal. Use it when you are in a group as well as solo. Keep
control
of it, learn how it paths and be ready to back it off, or destroy it when
necessary.

them

No. Melee skills are useless for INT casters.
Once you hit 20 they will start to suck bad, When you hit 30 you'll wonder
why casters
even get melee skills. Feel freen to hold items that are not weapons to get
increased
stats.

Keep in melee in the low levels until you max out your Defense and Dodge
skills though.
The Spell Banshee Aura will be your friend for a while.

money

Yes, this is standard practice for Necros, its what makes Necros the best
soloers
in the game. Necros have almost no down time. I the later levels when
someone casts
KEI on you, you will actually click it off since the HP>MANA conversion line
of the necro is better.

> Any other advise?

Get all the +HP items you can. For necros Hit points ARE mana!
Keep an eye on the bazaar, many items with +hps to be had there really
cheaply these days(If you don't have the expansions get them).
Get focus items, if you don't have a green silken drape(or an item with
affliction haste) get one.
