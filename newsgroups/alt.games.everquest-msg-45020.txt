As far as connecting the 2 computers I hope you have it configured as such

PC_1  NIC goes to hub port x
PC_2 NIC goes to hub port y

not real sure about the modem but with DSL I have hooked up have modem
connect to 'uplink' port of hub. Both PC's run the connect software.  Cable
modems might be different, but to connect 2 PC's peer-to-peer you should
have a hub in-between for stability.  Hubs are real cheap now a days ($30 US
for a 4 port one).
