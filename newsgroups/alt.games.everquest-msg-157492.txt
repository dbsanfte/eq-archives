Your group evac spells, buffs, heals, and otherwise, are more of an asset to
me, as opposed to where you can port me after the fight.

I am sorry you feel that this is such a horrible undoing to the druids and
wizard classes.

I personally don't see the ability to sit in the bazaar and pimp my ports as
such a "class vital" ability.  There are too many druids and wizzys that
port for free, so I guess I don't see the true bitterness you have about
these changes.

Good Luck and Good Hunting!
