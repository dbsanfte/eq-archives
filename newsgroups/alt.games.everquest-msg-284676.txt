Ditto.  What's worse, I kept forgetting to switch back to page 1,
so I'd forever be hitting the wrong keys afterward.  (Particularly
after switching to the hotkey page with all my "magus port" socials,
since using one of those causes me to zone, during which I CAN'T
switch back!)

I actually have all four bars in use; I keep bar 3 faded to alpha zero
so it's not in the way (much), and bar 4 usually hidden except when
needed.  I keep the keys organised sort of by urgency:

Bar 1 has things I need to be able to do with a single keystroke in
a hurry, or that I do a lot: kick, taunt, sneak, assist, feign death,
hide, clicky evac item, /loc+/time, etc.  Pages 2+ of that bar has a
lot of the keys set up the same but with variations for special
situations: secondary assist, fish instead of sneak, /autoinventory
instead of hide for when I'm tradeskilling, etc.

Bar 2 has things I need to be able to do on short notice but where
I don't mind having to use both hands for a moment.  I use ctrl+shft+#
for those keys (one finger easily hits ctrl+shft).  This has things
like /follow, /autoinventory for when I'm not tradeskilling, my hotkey
for looting (/target a_, /target an_, /loot), calling single and
multiple pulls (if I can't spare a finger long enough to hit ctrl+shft
then the pull isn't ready to bring to camp yet!), turning off tracking,
etc.

Bar 3 has spell sets and bandoliers, and my bridle for characters who
have one.  I use alt+shift+# for these.

Bar 4 page 1 has the magus ports (and nexus spires since I had a slot
to spare), page 2 has veteran reward keys and a few oddballs like the
key to bring up HoTT window.  Ctrl+alt+# does these.

In each case, the shift combo with the +/- keys switches to pages 2/1
on that bar, and shift combo + H opens/hides the window.  So I have 40
hotkeys available at any time, and another 40 available quickly, plus
I still have the rest of hotbar1 via the default shift-# to get to
less-used stuff.

Throw in ctrl-# for combat discs and alt-# for spells, and of course
ESC for closing windows (it's SO much faster than targetting the little
"x" in the corner, or even the Done button), plus "U" for opening doors
and merchants and bankers, and there's not a lot left to use the mouse
for! :)

	-- Don.

p.s.: The thing I really liked when they added hotbars2-4 was not just
that I could have so many functions available at once, but that it
meant I could use the same keys for the same thing on all characters.
When I had only one hotbar, I had to decide which characters didn't do
as much assisting and thus might put /assist on a separate page, etc.
Now, ALL my characters have /assist, /follow, /loot, /loc+/time, and
other common functions all in the same place, which makes for a lot
less fumbling when switching among characters!
