Yeah, I don't really know the numbers, and its possible that they have 5 
SK for every cleric.  I've only seen one SK, but there are several 
people on Role in the guild, and I figure if a group has an SK in it 
already they are unlikely to invite me to join in; the one I've seen has 
called me in to "rep" him.

I recall warriors and knights swinging back and forth several times over 
the years in desirability, worst of course was when the hybrid penalty 
meant everyone in the group paid thru the nose to have a knight instead 
of a warrior...

Ah, but rogues are merely low desirability while monks are outright Not

A common misconception about Combine/Sleeper is that its a roll back to 
the original game.  Its not, the rules set is identical to the one on 
other servers, the difference is in which zones you can go to, what loot 
is available, which quest mobs are and aren't in the game, things like that.

For example, there is a guy selling all those little low level 
disciplines that were put in for the pure melee classes; throw stone and 
the like.  He's hard to find and most people seem to think there isn't 
one, since there's no POK and the guy in EC tunnel isn't there... but I 
stumbled across him.  If he didn't exist, then those disciplines would 
be unavailable... but the rules set would still permit them.

As an SK, I find about one in five of my low level spells are missing, 
the Scream line.  For the most part, when this sort of thing happens its 
because there was no vendor for those spells in the old world, and 
because the one vendor added to EC who had some of them has been 
removed... however, a few of those spells were moved to the mass enchant 
vendor, including my beloved Terror spell.  Huge difference.

Now a lot of the utility of classes is based on itemization, and in many 
cases this is still lacking in an old world environment.  However, 
rogues, for example, have access in Jaggedpine to a 13/27 piercer; with 
a ratio like that I suspect their DPS would be adequate to compete with 
other DPS classes.  Barring that there's the Burning Rapier quest which 
yeilds, IIRC, a 7/20 piercer with a noticable proc.

People are also looking to the future here, this isn't an Old World 
server, its a Progression server, just a few days till Kunark, and we 
figure within a month after that, Velious... each time a new expansion 
opens up, thats a lot more itemization and a bunch of new spells and so 
forth.  Plus, of course, there is one thing they didn't use the new 
rules set for; we're currently limited to just 50 levels, and will be 
restricted to 60 levels until, what, Luclin?  I can't even remember when 
that changed its been so long.  Anyway, no AA till later, too.  Without 
AA, aren't Rangers the least desirable of the classes?
