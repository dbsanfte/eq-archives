Misty is a very good place to level at your 'age.'  It's one of the best
newbie zones in the game.  As a cleric, you should still be able to solo
fairly effectively for another few levels.... up to about...oh, maybe 9th?
That's when your combat weaknesses start showing up, and grouping becomes
the wiser choice.

By the time you're about 14th, your soloing days are as good as over, until
you get Holy Might at 19th.  Then, with effort, you can solo again for a
couple levels.  But life will be much better if you stick with groups once
you get in your teens.

Right now, (lvls 5-7), you're at your most powerful balance between spells
and melee that your cleric will ever be...which means that against an equal
enemy, you are at your prime for being able to take care of yourself.
Before long, your lack of hp's, combat stats, and your inefficient offensive
spells [too mana expensive & too long to cast], will start to show your
weaknesses, and you will have to rely on groups to survive and advance.
