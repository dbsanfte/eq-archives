If anything, Karana would be the one with the only real faction
issues.   There's *nothing* there in Dreadlands, GFay is a good
distance away from both elf cities and guards in the zone, and
Toxx is certainly remote.   Only North Karana has a problem
with guards wandering through the portal area.

At any rate, they won't nerf it.  There's no harm for anyone being
able to port up to Luclin to bank or sell.   Anyone hunting that
would use the DL portal can certainly make it to FV or OT;
anyone in Toxx has either Paineel or Erudin;  anyone in NK has
Qeynos or High Keep.   The only real possiblity of an advantage
is for evils in GFay where there's no easy way to bank or sell.
There's just not enough evils hunting in that area, though, to
make it an advantage.
