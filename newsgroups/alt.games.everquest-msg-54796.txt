Your right you know, the only sub level 20 doable chest piece I can find
is the Soiled Evoker's Robe from the warrens (+7 AC +2 Int -5 Cha +5
vsPos +10 vsDis +10 HP +0.50 Wt) next best is Ribcage Chest Armor (+6 AC
+2 vsFire +1.00 Wt) not great.

For a warrior (not including the 101 crafted peices) Minotaur Ribcage
(+16 AC +5 Str +5 Sta -9 Cha +7.50 Wt), Pristine Studded Leather Tunic
(+14 AC +2 Str +2 Agi +2 Dex +5 vsMg +5 vsPos +5.00 Wt), Small Scarab
Breastplate (+14 AC +1 Str +1 Sta -1 Dex +2 vsDis +10 HP +6.00 Wt),
Lockjaw Hide Vest (+12 AC +5 Sta +1.50 Wt), Dwarven Ringmail Tunic(+12
AC +8 vsMg +8 vsFire +8 vsCold +4.50 Wt), Reserve Militia Tunic (+9 AC
+3 Dex +5.00 Wt), Chitin Shell Armor (+17 AC +10 vsPos +6.50 Wt) quite a
bit more variety.

Ho hum
