I wasn't really talking about low levels, but about weapons in general.  If
your procs cannot be relied upon, then you need to upgrade that weapon.  You
might be able to get away with it at lower levels, but by the 50's, if
you're not using a procing weapon, you're going to have a hell of a time
playing no matter what the stats on your non-procing weapons are.
