  Ok.  It's entirely possible that this falls under "pet peeve" rather
than "doodspeak".  It's just that when I get just the "?", it means that
I have to think up a question to answer.  And being evil, I have to
fight the inclination think up the wrong one.

  You can see how this really wouldn't save much time.

  Well, while he is being more polite, you are being less annoying.

   See, for me this would be more of a "Fly into a blind rage" thing
rather than a "pet peeve" thing.  But leaving a group at a non critical
time because of it?  Perfectly fine.
