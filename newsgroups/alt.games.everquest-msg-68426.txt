Odd, I have 512mb RAM and the installer suggested everything on.

Anyway, Athlon XP 1600+, Geforce 3, Audigy sound, 512MB

Everything runs great with Win2k. I noticed that after entering a zone, I
may get a couple of pauses in the first few minutes after zoning. The memory
usage log shows that I am using about 540MB of virtual memory while playing
EQ, so I suspect there is some swapping going on after entering the zone.

Oh yeah, I play at 1600x1200x16, with clip plane maxed out. Much faster than
the old DX7 dll, especially in Kunark tree zones.
