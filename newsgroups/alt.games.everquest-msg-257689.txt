I think it makes the most sense in EQ to assume that level 1 characters
aren't really novices.  They've had considerable training already.  They've
been to Adventurers College, and then to grad school and got their Ph.D in
Clericing or Wizardry or whatever...and now they are out on their own,
have joined the local Guild for their class, and are setting about making a
living, and learning the difference between theory and practice.
