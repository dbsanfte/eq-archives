Too many people think easy travel is an "all or nothing" scenario.
It's not!  Fast and easy travel CAN be available to experienced
players, while newbies can continue to hoof it.

The newbies might THINK they hate that first scary trip through
Kithicor or that first long journey through WK, but it won't be
long until they lovingly remember the new, exciting, and exotic
experience.

Sure, later on, give 'em  NPC porters that charge cold, hard plat,
or some other mechanism.
