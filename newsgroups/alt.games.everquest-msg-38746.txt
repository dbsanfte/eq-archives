Seems to me that the smaller you are, the faster you 
'seem' to run.  I play a gnome enchanter, and as a 
gnome, I always feel like I've been sowed, but when I 
use the illusions (and none of my stats change so can't 
see why running speed would) to change to a human or a 
half elf, I always feel like I'm running slower.
