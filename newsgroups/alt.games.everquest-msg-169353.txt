    You can be a very good cleric without having the epic. Forget where I
heard that. ;-) I wouldn't stress over it too much.

    You had more done than them, and were higher level, and raided. F them.

    A cleric being non-KOS in Chardok just seems wrong to me, somehow. The
ring is nice, but I refuse to do it because of that.

    Even my alt rogue has Pick Locks at max. Sigh, damn rouges.

    The idiots are always KOS, aren't they?

    A true dwarven cleric, I see!

    Next time, kill the little mobs if they're on slow respawn times. Not
only does this increase your chances of survival, but when you get ressed
back in you'll have an emptier room to deal with. Did the non-KOS cleric
attempt to Pacify the room first?

    A bard? In a pull monk's group? That's asking for trouble, too. All it
takes is for the bard to forget to stop singing once.

    Um, ow. Sounds like it's time to call it a day.

    Yup!

    Get the raid to kill the Queen after the King. By the time you're done
with that, it shouldn't be hard convincing the raid to stay the rest of the
two hours until King pops again. Getting them out of the way at least two at
a time halves the number of trips you have to make.
