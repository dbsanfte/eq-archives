Its hard to find this now.  You might try compusa for online, but I
think your best bet is to call/visit all the places near you like EB,
Gamestop, etc. and hope that one of them still has one in stock.

I actually just reactivated my wife's account with EQ gold.  She was
missing the last three expansions, and that had two of them.  We found
one forsale at the local gamestop.  Ended up not really being worth it
though, as it didnt come with a free month like I thought it would, and
so I could have saved $10 just buying SoL and PoP separately.  For a new
account though, Gold sounds like definitely the way to go.
