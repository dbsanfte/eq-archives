I couldn't tell you for sure where to do it at 34, as I think I started a
bit later in my wizard's career.  Mana permitting, you could give the
cougars in Iceclad a try.  By the time cougars "green out" you can move to
spectres in Oasis or, better yet, the ones in OOT.  That's where I got into
the business.

To do it, you should do the quest in the Temple of Solusek Ro for the Staff
of Temperate Flux (or something like that, I've had mine forever and still
don't remember for sure).  This is the instant cast right click 6 point
resist debuff staff.  Get a sow potion and activate it ahead of your pull.
Then run into casting range and debuff as many of the specs as you can, as
quickly as you can.  Depending on your level, some may come just from assist
agro (much more often in Oasis than in OOT).

Once you have 4 of them, lead them around in circles until they get closer
together.  You can actually run a pretty tight circle without getting hit,
but be aware of how close you can allow the specs to get before they do
their lifetap spell on you, and keep them outside that range.  Depending on
the zone, and consequently any pathing irregularities, you can usually get
them pretty tight together by the time you've run 2 full circles around
them.  Then just run far enough ahead that you can get your snare spell off
before they reach you.

Once you cast BoF, you want to see 4 snare messages.  If you don't, you need
to decide whether to root the one that didn't get snared, just zone to abort
the whole quad kite, or whatever.  Your decision will usually depend on a
number of factors.  For example, in Oasis, a spec that you don't kill will
find its way to the docks and kill lowbies.  This is one reason I gave up
entirely on Oasis before long at all.  Bad pathing was another reason.

If BoF does snare all 4, just kite them exactly as you would kite a single.
Just make sure you keep BoF refreshed on the quad until they are all dead.
If it wears off before you kill them all, the quad has a nasty habit of
spreading out a bit and will often result in a bunch of wasted time and
mana.
