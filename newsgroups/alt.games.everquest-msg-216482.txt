Unlikely.  Oh sure, I could, but everybody just buffed and we're anxious to
get a move on, so as soon as we're good to go, we're going.  That moment
comes well before FM.

Why don't I just make sure the mobs never stop coming and assume the cleric
knows how to play his class?  If I can't assume even that much, we're doomed
anyway.  :)

On a hard mission, sure.  On normal the "minis" don't hit for all that much
more and have about 3x the hp of normal mobs.  Once a cleric goes into mana
regulating mode he should be able to finish that fight with as much mana as
he started with (it's the nukers that should be losing mana on those
fights).

Nah, group A finishes about 15 minutes faster, because they pulled the first
few fights a bit earlier, the next few fights a bit earlier, and the last
few fights a bit earlier.

Again, you fatalistically resign yourself to losing.  You know what people
do who think they're going to lose?  Lose.  This is the founding principle
of my guild.  Play to win and you probably will.

Won't argue with that other than to say that different classes vary.  I know
as my magician I will mostly use clicky nukes unless I need to drop a bomb.

I'll turn your question around.  If "all mana needed for a fight is
generated during that fight" then why bother wasting the time getting to
80%?

The benefit?  Your LDoN adventures last an hour.  Mine don't.  :)

I've actually played like that.  It's kinda fun, though considerably more
risky (30% mana > 30% HP).  Tends to make the warriors a bit...  weird.  It
was actually a decent tactic back in the "mow through as many blues as
possible" days (back before KEI and virtue...  omg, the horror!), and with
LDoN I've seen a couple clerics trying to bring it back.  A berserk warrior
puts out considerably more damage.

I personally think it's not enough of a DPS swing for the group to make it
worth the added risk.  But ya know, if a cleric decides to try it, I know
it's gonna be fun, or amusing, and either works for me.  :)
