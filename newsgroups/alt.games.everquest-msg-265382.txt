Got up this morning and tried to googol up some information on a couple 
local races, but no luck, strolled over to my polling place a block away 
and stood in a fast moving line for about 25 minutes, cast my votes 26 
minutes after they opened up.

So I'm morally superior to all those of you who haven't voted yet, get 
your butts out there and do your civic duty, even if you aren't voting 
the same way I did!

But enough haranguing, I had some random observations.

1) I was unable to verify the location of my polling place online, 
despite trying for most of an hour (I did get distracted a few times, 
but thetas why I only say "most").  How hard would it be to create a 
nationwide list, or at least a statewide list, where you put your 
address in and it tells you where you are supposed to vote?  Hook it up 
with Mapquest and you could even get a map!

This would have mattered more a few years ago, when my polling place was 
down some obscure country lanes at the firehouse for a town with 5 
buildings... that was tricky.  I moved to a town here and my new place 
is literally a block away; I've lived here for 9 years now, but I still 
remember what a mess it was to find the other place even having been 
there before.

With all the fuss and bother about polling places changing and the like, 
I thought it would be worth spending a minute to check, last night, and 
be sure what I was doing.  Then I spent 59 more minutes looking, 
incredulous that the information wasn't available online.  Best I could 
come up with was the phone number of my county registrar, who could tell 
me where to vote.  Checking this, the number was constantly busy, 
presumably other people doing the same thing!

Finally I found in a free handout from the League of Women Voters a list 
of the few places that -had- changed in the county this year, mine 
wasn't on it, just as I'd figured.  Voted today, same spot as always, 
and not surprised by this... just shocked that had there -been- a 
change, there was no easy way to find out on the net.  Soooooo 20th century!

2)  I also couldn't find any poll data on a local senate race; it was 
easy to find info on the presidential race (meaningless contradictory 
info, mind you, but lots of it)  But US Senate?  Nope, no help at all.

Here's my situation; there's a republican running who's been moderate 
and generally come down on my side of issues I care about, despite my 
libertarian/democratic general stance.  There's a democrat running 
against him who I think I'd prefer, based on his position papers and 
answers to questions posed by the LWV and so on.  BUT there's a third 
party challenger from the Constitution party who strikes me as very much 
the worst of the 4 people running, but who seems to have a large amount 
of support, by the unscientific method of looking at yard signs.

SO, I would vote for the democrat over the republican, but would vote 
for the republican over the constitution guy.  The Libertarian really 
doesn't seem to have a chance, and further I actually prefer either the 
republican or democrat to her, based again on her available information 
and answers to questions.

I figured I'd look at the polls, and if the race looked like a heat 
between republican and constitution, I'd vote republican, but if it was 
between democrat and republican, with the constitution guy safely 
trailing far behind, I'd vote democrat (even if it was clear the 
republican would win).

No polls, I ended up going republican, more a "vote against" the 
constitution guy, but that seems to be a pattern today.

3)  My polling place is in a local church.  Seems quite a few polling 
places are in churches, if you look around.  What's up with that?

My previous polling place was in a fire hall, I have no complaints about 
that, fire is non denominational and I don't remember seeing a 
"separation of heroes and state" article in the constitution.

But a church?  Why is that ok?  Its not a government building, its not a 
public building at all, its a religious institution!

Not only is a church a christian institution, but christians are divided 
up into a hodgepodge of denominations, I doubt this particular one 
represents 10% of the US population...maybe 20% of the locals, but this 
isn't a town election, national standards should apply.  It seems to me 
that this has to be at least mildly annoying for a pretty good chunk of 
the people voting.

Would people be as blasï¿½ about this if it was a church of 
scientologists?  How about a satanists church?  A KKK Rally building?  A 
mosque?

I can't dig up a list of polling locations (see point one) but just 
going by the short list of changed ones here locally we have:

Move from Emergency Medical Association to Christian & Missionary 
Alliance Church
Move from Lancaster Christian School to Seventh Day Adventist Church
Move from Ace Rents to YMCA
Move from St. John's Lutheran Church to Knights of Columbus
Move from Ephrata Railroad Station to Bethany United Church of Christ
Move from Ephrata Middle School to Ephrata Public Library
Move from Lincoln ELementary School to Hope United Methodist Church
Move from Interiors 2000 to Faith Bible Fellowship Church.

SO out of 16 locations past and present, 9 are religious; further, out 
of the 8 current ones a whopping 7 are religious, the trend here locally 
is actually -towards- religious institutions for voting.

While there's admittedly a wide range of christian denominations 
represented, not one of the 9 were anything -but- christian, how exactly 
is this not an endorsement of a religion?  I mean, if there was a 
Buddhist temple or a Cthulhu abattoir, there might be less to quarrel with.
