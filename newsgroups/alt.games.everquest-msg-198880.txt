I don't understand why this would be more of a hassle than a "priced" DKP
system.

Bid system: have to know points of all participants, have to have the basic
skills to run an auction (announce item, announce start bidding, when bidding
slows announce going going gone to be sure and flush out final bidders.  Decide
on whether you want a timed bid period, minimum bids, minimum increments... but
you only need to decide those issues once)

Priced system: Have to know points of all participants, then point values of all
items that might drop on raid.  When new items are released by SOE, you may need
to go back and revalue all old items.  Same when drop frequencies change, or
when skills or spells are added or nerfed or... well, I'm just saying values
change.  When more than one person is willing to buy item, you then need to fall
back on an alternate system: Bids?  Wow, you just added all the bids duties.
Something else?  Then you are really back on -that- system, but have just added
in DKP for additional work load.

I'm not saying a priced system is worse (or better) than a bids system, just
questioning  how its easier for the person running it.
