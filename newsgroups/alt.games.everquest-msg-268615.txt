Well I eventually worked out you cast the tradeskill spells when you
get a message saying "blah blah" and you cast the appropriate spell.

What they didn't tell me is that you can cast these spells ALL THE
TIME to help improve your crafting success. I was having a bit of a
whinge while at the machine cause I simply could not craft a pristine
piece of leather (need all pristine parts to make a good backpack). I
thought it was ridiculous that at level 10 I couldn't craft the
simplest item and get it pristine more than about one in five.

Anyway a helpful fellow told me all about it and to read what the
spells do and cast them (guess I should have RTFM)

Anyway my success rate has improved dramatically with just casting the
appropriate tradeskill spells over and over :)

One thing, I forage lots of raw basil, and basil is an ingredient in a
lot of cooking stuff ... but I have no recipe to turn raw basil into
usable basil ?

Cheers,
