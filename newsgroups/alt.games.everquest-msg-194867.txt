Yes, definitely check the Height Filter. After loading the eq-toolbox
map set, I banged my head on the wall for a while wondering why they
weren't working, until I figured that bit out.

Also, it seems that mapping is disabled in some zones. I noticed
this in ToV. Got a "Mapping is not available in this zone" message
even though the map set includes files for that zone.
