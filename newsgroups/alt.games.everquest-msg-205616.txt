For xp groups, I don't worry about it, I debuff as the mob is coming in, 
if my experience there shows that to be necessary, then I slow right 
away, standing next to the tank(s).  I do prefer having an SK or Paladin 
as the MA, as then I don't get agro at all.  There are however some mobs 
that I know better than to try to slow and get agro from.  I have to wait 
until agro is on the warrior MA for those mobs, because if I get agro, I 
am dead, not dinged up a bit, dead, if the slow is resisted.  A lot 
depends on the people I am with as well, if I have confidence in the 
cleric and the MA, I will take the chance, if I see that they are slow to 
heal and/or get agro back, I will wait.
