LoY had so many promising things.  I really enjoy the bank space for quest
items and trade skills.  The dyes are interesting, although somewhat
grotesque in instances.  The charms are a neat feature that introduce some
variety in the game.  One of the things I was really looking forward to was
the LFM (looking for more) feature.  I thought, hey i can sit in PoK, check
this, find a group that wants character X and send the leader a tell and
then go to that zone to hunt.  For the last few nights that I have checked
this feature on prexus for levels ranging 50 to 60, I have seen one group
use the feature.  Anyone else frustrated by that?  Any suggestions on how to
get more people to use that feature?  I was trying to avoid sitting in OS
for hours waiting for a group to open up, or running back and forth between
there and velks, or lower guk, or other zones that I can get decent exp in.
