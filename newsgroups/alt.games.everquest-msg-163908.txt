You got screwed.  What you can do depends on how much hassle you're willing
to go through.

You may have a fraud case.  Despite the EULA, he took money under false
pretenses.  The EULA violation is civil, while taking money is criminal.  If
you feel like setting a precedent, talk to a lawyer.  You may be able to get
a nice threatening letter written under a lawyer's letterhead demanding
either the character or your money back, plus a little extra.

Contact playerauctions.com.  Did you pay with a credit card or PayPal? 
Might want to talk to them, too.

How old is the guy?  He may be underage.  If so, give his parents a call.

As a last resort, you can also ruin his rep.  Post your story on server
boards.  People tend to not respect ebayed characters, but nobody likes a
thief.
