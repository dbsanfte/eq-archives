	Except shadowknights, who have an identical spread of DPS sources, with 
a lower total.

	The flipside of course, is that if you DO upgrade several areas, you 
get quite a *serious* dps boost. I currently have ID5 and BA5 on my SK, 
and frankly, no comment ;)

	To be honest, it is my belief that the only thing between your class 
and a serious nerfing is your low numbers. In a group that has a 
beastlord, I will usually forgo either a chanter or a shaman in favor of 
yet more DPS.

	Historically, nerfs have occurred when one class impinges heavily on 
the area of another. (one of the key causes for this is a lack of clear 
class definition in the first place) The famous monk tanking nerf, 
chanters doing more dps with charmed pets than dps classes, etc. If 
beastlords were as common as both enchanters and shaman put together, we 
would see sufficient complaints for Sony to have to get off their 
collective ass and nerf you.

cheers,
James
