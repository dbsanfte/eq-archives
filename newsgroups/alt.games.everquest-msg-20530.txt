sorry bud, you see what you wish. In the beginning I post my views on Ebay
buyers, now I post my views on calling people names for their choices in PC
names. You my friend seen opportunity to lash out and show that you were
some self proclaimed martyr who follows the lead given by the insubordinate
in this NG just to be recognized by your peers.
 I flamed the flamer this time. Productive ? , definitely counter in my
book. But the point remains as to who gives anyone the right to call another
an idiot. That my friend is much more productive then what ever point you
have that has yet to surface:-)

 I am not here to flame !!!! though you wish it so true. I mean, what would
you have to talk about LOL

Have a Nice Day Brent, you keep me laughing.
