I will almost always stop and give someone who asks politly clarity, and 
almost always if I am not nearby I will let them know, and the response 
is almost always, -ok thanks anyway-. I think people proceede under the 
assumption that it never hurts to ask.

Occasionally, someone will ask for clarity, and it is usually a druid,
they come find me, I will give them clarity and they will run off
without saying a thing. I have a druid so I know that clarity means more
to them than any other class. 

My wife played a cleric, and clerics get it much worse than enchanters,
druids, or anyone else. My wife got tells on numerous occasions from
people multiple zones away asking for rezzes, and they would not take a
nice no for an answer, -please please please-. Add to that people are
always telling clerics how to play their character....

: never charge for spell buffs and i never pay for spell buffs. I play a druid
: as one of my chars and if someone asks nicely for a CR SoW then I give them
: the buff, no cost to me so no cost to them. 

If I have mana and time I am always doing drive by buffing, and most
people are decent about it. Of course drive by clarity is always
apreciated, to my surprise the people who seem to demonstrate their
appreciation the most are necros. Often they, more than any other class,
will put a few plat up. When I can I respond with whatever bone chips I
have, and almost always they stick a few more plat up. Seven or eight
plat mean very little to me any more, but I do appreciate the gesture.

: for the cleric so i dont mind donating to save a few hours worth of kills
: exp.

Teles and rezzes are significant game downtime and the time the rezzee
gets back is significant, people should pay and are completly willing to
pay. I have seen people stiff druids on a tele though...

: One thing that really annoys me is people wanting me to 'Could you just

: platinum takes all of my mana so have to med to full 4/5 times to complete
: the task, takes a long time, and the bars are for jewel crafting to make

My experience is very different, people are very willing to pay to have
platinum enchanted, are almost always gracious, and they are usually
doing armor quests. I know of no non-enchanter doing platinum jewelry. 
I only knew one non-enchanter who did gold. I do remember some really 
bothersome people trying to do silver jewelry.
