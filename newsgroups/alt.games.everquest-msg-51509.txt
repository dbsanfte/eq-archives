Wondering, could I buy DAoC play it for a few days and if I don't like it
return it to EB or where-ever or would it be useless because I registered
it?

I don't think EQ has anything to fear but I am bored...nothing really for me
to do I don't feel like playing EQ now heh or any game honestly just looking
for something new and exciting
