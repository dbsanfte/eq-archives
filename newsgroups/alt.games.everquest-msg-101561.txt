...cant seem to hit the side of a barn from the inside and after reading a
few of the posts here I think it may be my fault. I read through a intro in
PC zone magazine (UK BTW) and they where saying that wisdom was important to
this class so put loads into that which I think I should have put a bit more
into stamina. the char has the following:
str = 80
sta = 75
agi = 95
dex = 84
wis = 105
int = 75
cha = 75
is there a way I can improve the hit count that my char does or do I have to
start over any advise would be nice. if I do have to start again could
someone advise me what points to put where. I prefer to play wood elves.
TIA.
