No, I didn't mean it that way. What I meant was that weapons and armors will 
be more class specific simply because there are greater differences between 
what those classes are able to use (Medium Armor vs Very Light Armor, Edged 
weapons, etc.), whereas items like jewelry are more generic. Same as EQ in 
that regard.
