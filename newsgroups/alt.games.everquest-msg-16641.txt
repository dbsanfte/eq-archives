>.and this has to do with what he said... how??

In my first post i used a time when i needed, wanted, whatever, SOW for a
corpse run as an example to illustrate a point i was trying to make. Still with
me?..
ok, so this guy comes back with you dont 'need' it you just wanted it...fair
point maybe ;) and also said "You should watch where youre goin"
/WHO
sorry just checking youre there.
I thought this was a tad much as i dont believe that anybody playing has always
"Watched where ther going" all the time.
So I replied to that saying the above and i also thought calling me a buff
beggar for a sow was a bit harsh and went on to outline my own personal
thoughts on buffing.

Are you snoring?
bah
:)
