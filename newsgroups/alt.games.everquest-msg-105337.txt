Some races have inborn abilities available to them.  As another poster has
stated, Halflings and Wood Elves have Hide as a racial ability.  Wood Elves
can also forage at skill 50.  Gnomes, no matter what class, can tinker.
Barbarians, Trolls and Orges have a 'slam' ability, which is similar to
bash, but with their shoulders.  Trolls and Iksars have natural regen
ability.  Vah-shirs have safe-fall at skill 50.
