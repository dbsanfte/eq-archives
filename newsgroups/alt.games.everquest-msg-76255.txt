Hey,

I was wondering how someone could get a list of everyone who is in a guild.
Our guild is new and the officers don't know how to get a complete list. I
am sure there must be some command. But we can' think of any.

We don't really want to know only those who are online at the time but a
complete list.

Is this possible?

P.
