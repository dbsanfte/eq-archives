What is the location of the Mithaniel Marr missionary in Sullon Zek which
will give you the Marr only bracer with the great stats for a small donation
of a few plat? I hear there are two. Is this true? One is supposed to be in
N.Freeport but I am not sure where exactly. Thanks for all info in advance.
