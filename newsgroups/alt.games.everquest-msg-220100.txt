Dont really know what i should think about this ....

We are going to play a game where level 1s (if they will be still there 
at all) will have all weaponskills ect maxed out ? Or maybe tradeskills 
as they were that annoying to raise ?

A big part of the fun in the game IS that you still have things to learn 
and get a reward (yes, even if you only can tell what direction you are 
facing)...

In my opinion the citymaps have been a great idea .... this way people 
might even try out more than before ... but starting with skills maxed 
is a bit boring i think .... you ll see things you would never see while 
you are fixed on : go right, you are facing north ect...

Its part of a roleplaying game to start without (or nearly without) 
skills and to raise them as you build your character ... thats what I 
have fun in ... and I wont wait for further "improvements"...

If we will go on like this the game will be starting at level 60 in a 
few month and there will be no question if you are able to enter the 
elemental planes at all... you ll be there .... ( even today starting 
untwinked is nearly impossible.... )...

Message to SOE : dont take too much of fun out of the game ... it should 
be still a challenge with rewards (even if many people wont say that 
raising SH is a challenge).

Have fun in game

Christian
