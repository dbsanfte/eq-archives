I never saw it much above 2400.  It really hasn't dropped much at all,
and it is summer.  Lots of folks playing outside more.

Folks who wanted to buy characters bought 'em, enough folks have

I hear about TP losing members to AV, and LoD spinning chaotically,
but other than that I'm not hearing about many folks leaving.  I'm
seeing another wave of folks coming back after a couple months off.
School is starting back up, I wouldn't be suprised to see the server
numbers come up a bit in the next month or so.  Then there is SoL
coming in December.
