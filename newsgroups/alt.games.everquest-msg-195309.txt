The trick is to find something that you can kill at 50% HP, which
means low blues. That admittedly gets harder as you get closer to 50th
lvl but at 42 the obvious place that springs to mind is the tundra
yeti caves in Dreadlands. I used to solo my monk there, from 40-45,
back when a pair of 8/20 fighting batons was uber. 

Also, these days don't forget about Aego/Virtue combined with
bandages. Don't underestimate the ability to bandage another 5 or 600
hitpoints when soloing. Not sure at what lvl the dagger from ToFS
procs, but it is a nice free source of bandages.
