Heh, after 56 lvls of being a Shaman, I just found out last night that my
pet can dualweild weapons and even take advantage of the weapons proc.  I
was in FF camp in Velks and Crystal Fang popped 3 times and dropped his fang
that procs Velium Shards.  These weapons being Lore I couldn't hold onto
them so I gave one to my pet just for the hell of it and noticed he was
piercing and proc'ing Velium Shards.  I then gave him a Velium Mace I had
looted earlier and hadn't destroyed it yet.  To my surprise he was crushing
and piercing the spiders.  Seems his damage output was increased
significantly also.  So, I guess those velium weapons aren't there just to
destroy afterall.  I'll be keeping a small handful of them on me always just
for my pet :)
