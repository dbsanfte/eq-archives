I died a bit, but not really a big problem.  I was taking on white cons
prior to having root.  Just DS, Nuke to pull from a distance, nuke again,
melee and cast until mob is dead.  This is with a completely untwinked
wizard, doesn't even have any gifts from friendly strangers.  Heck, at the
time he had all of about 3 armor slots filled, and he is still wielding his
newbie dagger at level 11.
