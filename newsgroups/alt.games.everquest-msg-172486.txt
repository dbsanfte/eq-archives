The terms/slangs I do not like ARE the likes of Tank...it has no place in a
fantasy enviroment, it's a gaming term and thats all. The same can be said
for Nuker.

I have no problem with names like Shamy, Wizzie, Pally etc or Inky, Dorf or
Assling for that matter.
I take offense at being called an Inky in game because I see it a derogatory
term as I would expect any Dwarf to, of Dorf and Halfling, of Assling.
Wizzie and the like, are, again what I would consider derogatory terms. If
someone asked my Wizard if "she" was a Wizzie I would reply "No, I'm a
Wizard" but not because I thought they were speaking out of character, only
because I feel such names are belittling to the class.

Gen X'ers would be late 20's early 30's by now, catch up. It's Generation Y
now :ï¿½)

EQ is (imo) no longer an RP game, sure some of us try and hold some RP
element to it but for the most part it's Quake TDM with Swords. It's all
game terms and tactics, best class for the job, most efficient raid group
etc...This is how the game has evolved and this is where RP stops...I'm sure
a lot of the players that are now Teir1 Guild members started off with RP in
mind and their early characters even prolly had fantasy names to go with it,
after a while it becomes obvious that this is a rat race and RP will only
slow you down and, tbh, the game doesn't entirely lend itself to it, either.
