After a good deal of killing I finally got all the drops for the axe. 
Its 8/35, which isn't as good as the 8/32 I got from the tutorial, but 
its 3 gnoll bane, which means its better than that in BB or other gnoll 
fighting, and it has quite a long list of misc stats including a little 
stamina and 10 hp, which raised me 12 hp total.  Of course in todays 
mudflation world I can probably buy much better for 10pp in the bazaar, 
but up till now I've lived strictly off the land, trying to get a feel 
for how the class works at low levels without twinking.

The snare is a really nice one, duration about a minute, recast time 
about 6 seconds, fails rarely unless used on deep red mobs, there's a 
message telling you whether it stuck or not and another when it wears 
off.  I axe kited a polar bear to death just to see if it could be done; 
yes but the axe damage is so low it takes a long time.

To use the snare you have to have a ranged weapon in range slot, and it 
uses one up per snare.  The ability to produce throwing axes in quantity 
suddenly becomes more than just a "so I have a decent way to pull" thing.

Snare is usable from melee range, whether or not you have autoattack on, 
and out to full throwing range more or less (haven't actually 
experimented to see if the distance is the same precisely).  You do have 
to have LOS, which means if you don't snare a mob before it runs, 
indoors, you can easily lose your chance at it.  With a one minute 
duration, though, there's not too much excuse for not snaring before a 
mob starts to run.

In subsequent use I've seen other numbers, more rarely, none over 20, 
but some less.  Sometimes I see two frenzy hits with one frenzy click, 
like double attack or dual weild... except I will never get dual weild 
(all weapons being two handers) and don't get double attack till 15 or 
so.  Average hit on a double is 37 points.  Swapping in my 6/31 weapon I 
still typically got 20 damage frenzies, seemed no difference at all 
insofar as frenzy went.

All parts dropped off common mobs, the pain is that there are lots and 
lots of various bones and other parts that drop, so it can take a long 
while to get the drop you need.  Luckily, BB is a fun place, and even 
more fun when you have a reliable snare to stop runners, and if 
necessary to snare your opponents so you can run to zone.  Note, 
remember to keep refilling the range/ammo slots, as having no snare and 
no time to make the axes to use to do it is a jolting surprise when 
you're relying on it.

By level 10 I've had a grand total of 3 natural skill ups in intimidate 
despite near constant use.  I've seen it work about 12 times in all, 
despite plunking 35 points worth of training points into it (total skill 
38).  On the other hand, checking with higher level BER I'm told that 
the skill cap for it is 200, and conversations with a monk about the 
skill suggest that its pretty reliable over 150 or so.

This suggests to me that the class is a DPS engine with a few tricks up 
his sleeve, and capable of soloing more readily than many melee types, 
the principle lack being a way to split well... and even there the snare 
might do the trick, if sloppily, in places where a run to zone can be 
used, or where you can outrun a mob's follow distance.
