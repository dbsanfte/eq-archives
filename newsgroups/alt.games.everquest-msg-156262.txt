Glad everyone thinks the monk nerf was needed. I play a 44 monk in full gear
and before the nerf I was so powerful I could solo blues. It was a really
fun class to play ---  I never neeeded a group unless I choose to. Things
are different now. Oh, yes I could solo before but I guarantee the
experience was so slow it made more sence to group. But time constants to
play eq don't afford me the luxury of sitting in a zone yelling LFG or port
please ---and I didn't  want to play a caster.

Wait did I say I could solo blues? Lets see, Necros solo yellow reds,
wizzy's solo yellow reds and quad kite, Druids can solo yellow reds and quad
and powerlevel.

In Fact, while Sony nerfs all the classes one by one they still find time to
give the druids more. I think druids just got a super fine heal at higher
levels. Nobody at verant screems lets nerf the druid.

Wow,,, that's the answer! All the monks stop whining and sell their
equipment start a druid!
