Your license does NOT allow you to charge money for the viewing of or
publicly display the material. As a matter of fact, *it expressly
forbids it*.

The music industry was shut down not just because they went after mix
tapes, but moreso because they tried to prohibit you for making copies,
or compilations, from media for which you have already purchased a
license to listen to/view *personally* as a *single consumer*. 

The P2P issue affords them leverage only because the intent of its usage
is primarily (not exclusively) the pirating of this media. The exchange
of media in that forum for which you have not paid is piracy and
completely illegal. There is no question. Therefore, while they may not
succeed in shutting down all the P2P services, they will find success in
prosecuting those who use it for piracy.

No, that's not at all what I said. I did say that IP owners have the
right to prevent others from profitting directly from their IP. By
directly from, I mean using it to provide a service that the IP is
designed to provide to begin with. EverQuest is designed so that you can
enjoy the high end raiding game if you invest enough time into it, which
also means an investment of money. If that monetary investment is
redirected toward a non-licensed individual so that you can leapfrog the
character development cycle, then

Um, I'm no attorney, but I'm pretty sure they do have that very right.
You don't see people re-packaging MS Windows with their own little added
features and such and re-selling at a profit without being licensed, now
do you? You don't see people re-publishing the Harry Potter books with
their own illustrations or editorial narratives without the express
authorization of the author/publisher, do you? Those are just a couple of 
ideas for turning a fairly certain profit if, in fact, it were legal as 
you claim.

Are *you* an attorney, btw?
