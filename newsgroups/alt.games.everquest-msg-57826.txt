Get a Necro or SK to sumon your corpse go to Nek Forest and pay a newbi to
buy your coffin for you. Most will jump at the chance to earn some plat. Yes
It is a risk paying for it first but if you offier a decent Item or say 50p
as payment most will return with the coffin. I gave 100p to a newbie Necro
to buy my Enchant Silver Electrum Gold and Plat Spells gave him a dagger of
Marnik and 15 p as payment after he returned the change he was thrilled.
