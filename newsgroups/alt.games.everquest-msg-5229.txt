The only problem with using buffs for healing is that it doesnt use the same
specialization as a normal heal does.  This wont be a problem at your level
but at higher levels it can effect your mana effeciency.

Saying that, using group hero in certain situations at high level can really
save some ass.

As for agro management, it comes down to common sense.  Dont heal someone
early unless you have to, wait until your group builds up some agro first
and if you do need to heal that incomming puller then make sure you have DA
and DB memmed.
