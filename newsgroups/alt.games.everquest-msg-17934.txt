Keep all your melee skills maxed is my suggestion.  You will never know when
you find that killer 2hs weap, and guess what... You never practiced it.

Also 1hs weaps seem to do more damage over time as they miss less, or hit
more often rather, since their delay is so much lower. When you miss twice
in a row with a 2hs, it seems like you take forever to get a hit.  Plus,
when duel wielding, and you get your double attack and riposte??? That's 5
hits in one turn!
