Your wearing of Crafted clearly marks you as a Warrior. At 43rd - unless you
bought your account - you've probably already heard the Warrior Mantra "AC
is KING!".  My thoughts have always been that I will not give up AC for
stats unless I can make up that AC someplace else.  The sole exception so
far is to wear a FBSS instead of a Spider Fur belt when I am the main tank
in order to hit faster and generate better aggro.  Kind of an oxymoron
really:  lowering my AC in order to improve the chances of being swung at,
knowing I'll get hit more since I'm missing 10 AC.
Bottom line opinion: stick with AC unless the stat improvement is compelling
( ie, taking you over a hump) and/or you can make that AC up in another
slot.
