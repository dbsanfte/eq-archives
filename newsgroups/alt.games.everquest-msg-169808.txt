Our guild used to live in HS.  Still one of my favorite zones, although
sadly the majority of it went light blue at 61.  (time to level up the
twink!)

Two mobs patrol the zone in area, they are usually undead, but they can be
living.

People did exp there, but it was, and probably always will be, very BYOG.
On the (very) bright side, the key quest keeps 90 percent of the morons out.

If you all zone in pretty close together, you should be fine.  Zoning in
alone is not really recommended unless you're pretty sure you can handle two
harm touching skeletons solo.   Bring an evac person.  The closest exit for
people who cannot gate is at the end of the South wing, (3'rd in the
progression) and pretty difficult to fight to, unless you're high level.

With the "blue nerf" at 60 plus, HS is likely to go back to being one of the
least populated zones.   Which is kind of a shame, since it's an incredible
place.

Your sig says level 49, so you should be fine in there.  Below 45 you're
asking for trouble, but you can probably do the north wing and west wing
passably around 50 or high 40's.
