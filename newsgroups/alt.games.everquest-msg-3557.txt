Yes, if its a creature that runs away when its near death rather than
chasing it with sword........just shoot arrows at it til it dies.

If you are a ranger even better you can snare it then run backwards and
pepper it.......takes a long time to kill it and about half a quiver of
arrows <G>......

Buy arrows with range equal to your bow (try to get at least 100 range tho)
........don't waste money on higher damage arrows tho. its not cost
efficient.
