Since losing my corpse a few weeks ago i've been buying all new stuff for my
warrior. only slot not replaced is face. I had a Split Paw hide mask b4, can
someone recommend a suitable resplacement. Currently my total stats are
132STR 75 AGI 85 STA 79DEX 75 CHA as far is I recall. SVMagic is 59 Cold
about 35 others all low, (as low as 15 for fire). HP is 1052 unbuffed. Soon
as I loot a sarnak tabard magic should rise by 10, HP by 20. What should I
look out for, for my face. I have some fine blue plate greaves, should I be
looking for good deals on that stuff, or be lookng for Crafted armour (got
some cheap Crafted Gaunts, blue by chance, look nice). hehe got bracer of
the hidden though I dunno what good it is. Anyone know if its really that
useful, how often do u encounter invis mobs? I could sell it for 1.3Kpp+
