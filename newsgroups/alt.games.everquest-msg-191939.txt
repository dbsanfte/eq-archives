OK this has been bothering me for to days now.  I was reading something
here, and linked to a descusion of duel wieling and damadge bonuses.  I
don't remember if they where the same discusion, but I remember that the
first page had a list in a table of all the bonus damadge by Skill / Level /
Delay of wepon.  The other page was on the mechanicks of max damadge, with
the math behinde it.  It had about 10 - 15 graph's to show what the "magic"
numbers where at diferent stages of character development.

I believe that these where on one of the Ranger sites, but I have been
trying and trying to find them.  Went all through my history.

Any help would be appreciated.

Omiin.
