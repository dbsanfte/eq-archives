I noticed that on Lucy too yesterday... even at 65th level... when it 
would last some 3 hours who would be using it then? You can't even cast 
it on others... so its not even a buff to give to lowbies as a 65th 
level good samaritan.... (tho it would be pretty sweet to get a 3 hours 
DS at level one :)
