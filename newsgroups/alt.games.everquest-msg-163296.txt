If its of any interest I was using a Diamond MX300 on a second PC of mine 
(Celery@464MHz) with a Voodoo 3 video card. EQ would run but I could only use 
the old UI (new UI would ALWAYS crash to desktop). Even when I was using the old 
UI the game would crash to desktop every now and then while I was playing. I 
didn't look into it too much further than searching the eqlive troubleshooting 
pages because it was only a second PC I used now and then.

Try removing the NEWUI (from memory) line from your eqclient.ini. Try changing 
soundcards if possible and see if it helps.
