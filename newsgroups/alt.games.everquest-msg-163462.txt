It would not be possible to implement it in game such that it reflected the
amount of effort that is truly required, and still allow someone to do
anything else in the game.  I think that Verant managed to strike a balance
that allows those that are dedicated enough to learn the tradeskills, while
not allowing the dabblers to get very far.  Personally, I enjoy doing
tradeskills, and it has taken a significant amount of time and platinum away
from other things I could be doing.  On the other hand, I get a lot of
pleasure from finally being able to make some item that I could have bought
for a fraction of what I spent getting to that point.  It just feels good to
make it yourself.
