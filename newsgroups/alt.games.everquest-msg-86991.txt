Hmm -- perhaps the best thing is for the MQ seller and buyer to try
to determine a third party whom they both trust to hold the cash
until the transaction is completed (or not completed).

At higher levels, it shouldn't be too hard to do that -- seldom
do two people *not* know someone in common they consider trustworthy.
And if they don't, maybe there's a good reason (like one of the
two is a scumsucker).
