Yep, you said it... Burned out... Heal, sit med, Heal, sit med, Buff,
sit med, Heal, sit med... ad nasueam.
But I have brought him out of retirement (well semi out) hes 52 and
has one yellow till ding (been that way for about 5 months) I want to
get him to 56 so I can play with the new hammer, but LO... my monk is
quite a great fit for my play style and time allowance.

Im glad some of my posts have been helpful...wether they be questions
you were about to ask and I beat ya to em or a response that was just
timely  
 8 ), nice to hear (sometimes wonder if im just spouting garbage)
