Hi folks,
I've returned to the game after leaving for about a year. I bought the 
platinum package so I'm all set with the expansions (minus OoW). When I sign 
on to play though, it seems like no one at all is in the newbie zones. Even 
in POK the pops are between 50 and 70 (in the couple times I've wandered 
through). Is my timing just off? Have that many people jumped ship? Or has 
everyone just leveled beyond my newbie reach and found new places to hang 
out? Would I possibly be better off starting on one of the preferred 
servers?
Thanks for any thoughts,
Rick
