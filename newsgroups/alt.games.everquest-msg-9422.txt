Well, it is very candid of you to admit your jealousy at my ample
proportions, Ronald.

>By the way, can I post your address and phone number now?

Senility check. Hellloooooooooo? You already have. You remember? Right
after I said you could post it so long as you fully accepted the
consequences of your actions.

Could someone kindly explain to our resident retard that christenings
are not an exclusively catholic ceremony. I know that this knowledge
isn't immediately available to you, Ronald, as nobody has ever wanted
to ask you to be a godfather.

Is this the point where we're all meant to be side-tracked about the
subject (you) and go on endlessly about being a godparent? You'd make
a shite magician, Ronald. You're meant to distract the audience's
attention at the critical moment, not reinforce their assumptions that
you are a clueless cunt.

I'd hate to steal the limelight from you.
