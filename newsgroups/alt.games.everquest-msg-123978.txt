I am running on recollection here (so may be incorrect) but I think that
cat's have major problems with anything based on Pyrethrum. Pyrethrum
daisies are normally a lovely white flower and plant which bugs <hate>. We
are talking "Your faction cannot possibly get any worse" kind of hate.

This has not gone unnoticed to mankind and a lot of pesticides are based
around this charming little white daisy. You can go into a garden store and
buy Pyrethrum Powder by the bucketload...... just don't stick it on your cat
though. It affects their nervous system and in extreme cases (or with
kittens) can lead to respiratory failure...

"Mommy - why is socks stiff as a board?"

Be careful as a lot of alternate pesticides can be based around this,
normally good home remedies from your local hippy can be decidedly cat
unfriendly.
