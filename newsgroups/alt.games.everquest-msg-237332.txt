/shrug 
On a blue there are a few who you can fight, most people want a PvE
game. If I knew there were reds around I may turn in a book myself. It
would be fun to play around.

I think what is more interesting is the reaction people get on the red
servers to someone who actually wants to PvP! Ok Rallos I got a
character up and was PvPing someone, a higher level person came along
and healed them. The plan apparently is that it is PvP, but people
play it like it was PvE, resorting to PvP only to resolve disputes.
People despised Flowers of Happiness for being PvP players, which was
more baffling.

It sounded stupid, to have a PvP server and pretend it was PvE.
