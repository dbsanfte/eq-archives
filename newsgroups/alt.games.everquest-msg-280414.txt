Yes, it is the case.  Only the damage component stacks, none of the other 
effects.  I believe that in some cases, DoTs won't stack due to the other 
components, not sure about the Darkness line off hand.  As a shaman, all 
my DoTs are just DoTs, no additional component to them, and they all 
stack, including different DoTs in the same line, as well as stacking 
with the identical DoTs from others.
