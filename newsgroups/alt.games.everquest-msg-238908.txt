Check out stalking probes.  Cost is about 30p in bazaar for a 5 charge
probe, or 16p if you have a tinker alt (triv 102).  They do not vanish when
empty and you can sell an empty to vendor for 14p.   If you do have a tinker
the supplies are all available in pok.  I figure that making them my self
and selling the empties, it costs me 1.3p per use (including 25% tinkerloss
at skill 102).  Also they are insta-cast.  I keep up to 5 probes on me and
another 5 in bank.
