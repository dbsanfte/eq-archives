Recent work commitments mean I have become a casual player, with maybe 1-2
hours per week night to play, more time at the weekends obviously. This is
the reason I play a solo class, a ranger. I took a break from EQ since I was
getting burned out from fear kiting Griffs in Jaggedpine. I wanted to do
something else in the game other than grind exp, but recieved few
suggestions for worthwhile quests for a ranger to do solo at 51 and trade
skilling never appealled to me.
With the hours I play most of the multiplayer stuff is beyond me, (UK player
on US server, 1-2 hours evening, around 9-11pm GMT) and finding a pickup
group could be a lottery.
VI announced a while back that PoP would address the issue of high level
players, especially level 60, getting bored with the game play, encounters,
and various issues that resulted from the realease of SoL. They mentioned
that they would be introducing exciting new content for both the hardcore
and casual player alike.
So far I have only seen mention of events and challenges for small raid
parties or groups, such as quick zone in/zone out encounters, with flags
given for successful completion and so on.
Has anyone seen any solo content in PoP (other than places to fear kite) or
encounters that a casual player can get involved with? Are there any new
quests that can be soloed, either at 51, or any level up to 65?
For now I'm playing Morrowind, a good single player game, but I still want
to return to EQ. I may not play much of a social game as a soloer but I
interact with other players often through trading in the bazaar, helping
noobs or lowbies, or chatting to friends in tells. I would love to spend six
hours with a raid group but, weekends aside, that just in not an option.
I do not plan to buy PoP for the transport system alone, since I never
travelled that much before. I usually found a good hunting zone and stay for
a few levels to grind.
Have not seen much info here on the new PoP events, just zone or item info.
