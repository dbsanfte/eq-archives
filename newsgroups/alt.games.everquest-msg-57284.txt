I do believe he was full of shit.

I'm in America...Florida, specifically.  We have a rather large Hispanic
population (although not nearly as big as Miami, which makes me think of
Quebec since they're as American as Quebecers are Canadians :) ).  It used
to bother the snot outta me in the lunchroom when a gaggle of women were
babbling in Spanish.

It took me a long time but I finally realized I really didn't give a crap
what they were saying and was surprised that I ever cared.  Having ones
bigotry (as minor as it really was since I never disliked the person, just
the language) pointed out to oneself BY oneself is an interesting
experience!

Someone pointed out that if they call TRAIN in their own language you may
miss it and die.   Well, a couple things:

- If you're on the tracks, don't be too shocked if you're hit by a train.
Most people don't call them ANYWAY.
- Chances are very good that they'll still call "TRAIN!"  It's an English
word but one they've grown used to.  But just in case:

(at http://translator.dictionary.com)

TREN!!!!  (Spanish)
TRAIN!!! (French)
TRENO!!!! (Italian)
SERIE!!!  (German)

Don't sweat it...if you don't read words you can understand then I'd
recommend either/both of the following:

- Gain an interest in foreign languages.  I have a blast trying to translate
stuff, and I've never had a foreign language class.
- Ignore them.  You aren't missing anything of importance anyway.
