(with the small exception of those stupid OoW archery procs).

The problem is that they took a class that was once a pretty good
damage dealer, (before, and for a while after PoP) and decided to take
it in a new direction.  But the AAs and weapons rangers get seem to
keep them only about in line with the other non-rogue/monk melee.  The
other spells and abilities are definitely worth something though, so I
try not to complain too much.  I do think that Rangers need some more
DPS help, but I know I'm biased.
