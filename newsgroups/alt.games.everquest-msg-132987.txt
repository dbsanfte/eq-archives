Really??  I guess I hadn't realized that children of the 21st Century
were so smart...

Reading, Writing, Stephen Hawking AND HIV/AIDs...  WOW...

Hehehehehehehe

You sound like one of those metaphysical liberals who thinks that all
one has to do is believe and it will be so...  :^)

What you are saying is contradicted by Lesa's statement that she would
withhold information that she would consider TOO difficult..

Which is it??  

Either it is:

A- A 2 yr old can learn ANYTHING, as long as there is someone willing
to teach it....

or  

B> There are somethings that are beyond a 2 yr old's comprehension and
ability to learn...

Ya'all can't have it both ways..

Either they are teachable of everything or they are not...

I am usually quite astute at movie quotes (haven't been stumped yet)
but I don't recall this one...

I will concede that possibility.  Hell, I'll even go so far as to say
it's a probability.

Frustration does not excuse rudeness...

However as to your point..  Like above:

You say "The only thing keeping them from being ready is your
unwillingness to teach them." thereby implying that a 2 yr old can
learn ANYTHING, if only there is someone willing to teach them.

Yet, in previous posts you (and Lesa) claim that you only tell a child
as much as you feel they can comprehend.

I submit that is a contradictory position.

Kudos...  I wasn't even referring to that part, as I haven't a clue
what the word means.  I suppose I COULD look it up and be even MORE
offended, but the point has been made...  :^)

No, as I have had that experience and can use my own experiences to
validate YOUR opinion...
