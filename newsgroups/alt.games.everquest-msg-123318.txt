My cleric has an assist hotkey on every hotkey page (same slot too so
I can always remember it.

The key is just
/assist
with no target name or anything.... but its markably faster than typing
/as
all the time.

I target the main tank, hit assist to see his target, then again to see what
the target is hitting and whether it needs a heal, back to the mob, then
back to see what its hitting now... back and forth like this just by hitting
8 8 8 8 8

While this isn't all that crucial in a group (where I can rely principly on
the HP bars to tell me what is happening to my party members) its
vital in multigroup raids.

Since I have a straight assist button, I can use it in a variety of ways.
Chanter getting beat on?  Target chanter, assist, and root or stun (non
damage stun that is) the mob beating him down.  Curious as to
whether the MA is taunting enough?  Assist that mob and we'll see who
he hates the most.  Sometimes I actually want to melee or nuke or
chain stun the main target... in which case I select the MA and assist him
to find my target like everyone else.

Oh, I notice I'm using the term MA.  This means Main Assist.  What
you may think of as Main Tank... as discussed earlier in this thread,
you pick one tank to take as much of the damage as possible, and
everyone else assists him so all are on one target.  The vital, critical,
got to do it nature of the assist technique is such that this person is
not refered to as MT (main tank) but rather MA.

Assist the MA is the job of almost everyone in almost every group.

To muddy the waters, you may in large raids see SA... Secondary
Assist.  Usually this is the "Vice President" to be ignored unless
your MA dies, but good raiders who are used to using a tailor
made assist key with the MA's name on it will also make another
key with the SA so they are ready.  In some cases, you'll meet
"unmezzable" mobs, and here the SA will actually tank those adds
with perhaps the help of a select few who are designated to assist
him instead of the MA.

I've even seen TA (Third Assist) from time to time...
