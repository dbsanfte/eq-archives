That's just the way it's designed to work.

I believe the reason for it is so that it's always 5
points behind a Warrior's offense/defense skill at the same
level.  Because hybrids (like Paladins, Rangers, etc.)
can use spells to help them in combat, it wouldn't be fair
if hybrids could also fight as well as Warriors,
so they get certain fighting handicaps in order to
balance out the advantage they get from spellcasting.
This is one of them.
