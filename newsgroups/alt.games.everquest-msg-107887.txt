His point was that you're being a ponpous buffoon. Your complaints
have ZERO grounds in reality. Your expectations are stupid. It's like
bitching that the tech support guy at your ISP said "Thank you, bye"
instead of "Thank you for calling, good-bye".

His point is you're fucking wrong and too stuck-up to admit it.

Utter bullshit and you know it.
