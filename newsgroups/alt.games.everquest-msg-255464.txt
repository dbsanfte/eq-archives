I keep reading this phrase "putting the time in" but surely EQ isn't a 
job, it is a leisure activity. I "put the time in" at work in order to 
get paid, and pay SOE. I think this phrase should read "commit large 
amounts of time in a single session", because it seems to me that most 
people here "put the time in", they just can't do it in the same manner 
as raiders.
Who are the people who benefit from long raids into the early hours or 
taking up whole weekends:

o A single unemployed person on a fat redundancy pay-off
o A person living at home with understanding parents
o someone who has an understanding employer for those days when you are
just too tired to turn-up or take it easy.

or Average Joe,
o with a wife who expects to enjoy some time with her husband
o a father who wants to spend time with his children
o with an employer who expects some value for paying wages, and doesn't 
take "had a late night raiding" as a valid excuse for poor productivity.


Personally, I don't mind whether the uber raiders have better loot than 
me and where 3 of them can take down mobs I would stuggle to get two 
groups together and take down. Since like everything else when something 
better comes along that suits my playing style I will play that.

Just don't talk about "putting in the time", it may take me longer, but 
when you have quit EQ from raid-burnout I will still be here slowly 
"putting the time in" hoping to reach the end-game. If the game don't 
change/evolve into something I am prepared to pay for, and there is a 
better alternative then YCHMS. But you won't want it.
