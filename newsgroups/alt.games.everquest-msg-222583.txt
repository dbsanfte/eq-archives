Yes, another "Where's the best place for me to hunt at level ..." message. I
enjoy LDoN a lot and have a regular group there that I meet up with almost
daily. But when they're not available, or just because I'd like to keep my
soloing and combat skills fresh, I would like to go do some solo hunting
again. Trouble is, I haven't done that since around 42 or so.

Just having hit 49 I've got new spells, a new pet, new buffs and a new Rage
self-buff which is what started me thinking about all of this.

Appreciate any suggestions!

Thanks,
