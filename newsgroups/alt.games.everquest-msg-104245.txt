Why wait till then? I was playing my main all night when I got my
alt's last name changed, I just stated in the petition that I wanted
to change the last name of one of my other characters and didn't log
her in till the GM was ready to change her name for me. As long as
you're able to switch characters for a minute to perform the deed,
petition from whichever character you like.
