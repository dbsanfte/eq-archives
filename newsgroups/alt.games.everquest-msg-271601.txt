They are closer to a Warrior than a Berserker,because they get taunt
and can use the same weapons as a Warrior with very little exceptions.
Berserkers dont get taunt,right?
Oh and they get kick too!  :)
Not hard to manage the spells,usually I even dont need all spellslots.

Can only speak from my personal experience,but for example my 
55 Ranger plays Maintank in PoD in castle area quite often,mobs are
white to red to me there and hit for 350.This is with a full group of
mid fifties players.Casters love me tanking,never do I loose aggro.
Tanking a normal Ldon is a joke,mobs hit for around 120 at that level.
This is with a non-twinked char not on my home server,so he earned
all his gear by himself,he has 3k hps unbuffed.

I dont know where you get the idea from that there is a difference in
damage taken,both classes share the same armour,all my armour is
labeled Rng,Rog,Shm,Ber.
