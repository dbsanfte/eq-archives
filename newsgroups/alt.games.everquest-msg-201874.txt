Actually, if not for the free KEI and Aego, I wouldn't have been there
at all at that time. I was there with the specific intent of soloing and
getting the full mileage out of the buffs. 

Also, for the record, I would never join a group that showed me such a
lack of common courtesy. I have more respect for myself than that.
Perhaps if more people felt that way and stood up for that belief, fewer
people would misbehave so. Just because you can't beat 'em doesn't mean
you have to join 'em, especially when they're so lacking in any level of
maturity.
