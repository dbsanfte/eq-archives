Hello Not a...

While I really don't want to jump on the band wagon here, you do sound like
a jack ass.  Just the type of jack ass I met the other day at an orc camp in
the commons.  A group of 4 of us were hunting orcs and a 47 dr00d came in
and ganked every spawn on us for his lvl 7 friend to hack at.

Plain and simple - if you are going to PL a guy, don't do it in a static
newbie spawn area.  Take him out and hunt random spawns like spiders, bears
etc... (well if you are a dr00d, maybe not bears).
