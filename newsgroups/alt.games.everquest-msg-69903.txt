Then you've been quite fortunate if it was by strangers. Sure, it
happens, but I know my wizard could rarely find a group, and in our
guild, our mid level wizards constantly post that they need guildies to
hook up with to group. YMMV.

Again, possibly they can. For others, particularly if supporting
resources are not available, it doesn't always happen like that. You say
you are about to ding fifty and you prefer to primarily solo. I have to
ask you, how do you deal with the downtime? One good friend from my old
guild got his wizard to 53 and finally just quit. He also solo'd a lot.
And whether it was root/nuke or quad kiting, he was perpetually angry
about the fact that he could go out and easily make one kill (or set of
kills when kiting) but then he could basically sit in a safe spot and go
read a book or watch a movie because it took so long to get that much
mana back up. Drove him nuts. He now plays a mid forties Paladin.

Well, I don't know anything about you personally, your character, etc.
so I can't rightfully throw in the "bullshit flag" on this one. But I
find the claim that *ANY* fucking character in this game made it to
level fifty and only died fifteen times. My latest alt is a necro. (The
class known as the kings of "never dying") and I've already had at
*least* fifteen deaths in the first twentyfive levels. (Had one
yesterday in fact... long story.)

No.... if you're referring to my post, all I said was that at 29 (not
mid twenties) wizards get a snare at last.(Snaring ability allows at
least the *possibility* of some kiting, though not AoE quad kiting with
that limited mana pool.) This can make all the difference in both
hunting methods and escape capability, and hence, lowered death rate.
Quad kiting come much later (or so I'm told, as I haven't made it that
high with a wizard yet) but snare is a powerful tool for a caster.

My wizard was perpetually broke. Loot sucks at those levels, and spells
are expensive. Keeping a supply of SoW potions on hand was out of the
question. J-boots definitely help all classes, I'll agree, but they help
the solo INT caster without snare a hell of a lot more in the early
levels if you can twink one up with them.
