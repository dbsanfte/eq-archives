I used to play Quakeworld on a server running a mod where everyone
started with all weapons and unlimited ammo and full armor.  The only
death penalty was someone else got a frag point for killing you, you
got some trash talk, and you found yourself at some random spot in
map.

Oddly enough, I managed to learn from my mistakes there.

So would you enjoy even more a game where death is permanent?

Corpse recovery can be fun in EQ...for the people *doing* to corpse
recovery.  I had fun taking my Rogue into the Hole to get corpses when
our raid wiped out.  I got to see much more of the zone during the
corpse recovery than I did during the "sucessful" parts of the raid,
in fact, because my main is a Wizard.  My role on a raid is to stay in
the designated area and nuke things when the puller brings them.  I
only get to do some tourism when the herd is told to move from one
designated area to another, and I don't see much then, because I'm too
busy trying to not get lost as lag makes players warp around.  On most
raids, though, a wipeout means I get to sit at my bind point for a
while, waiting for a res.  Oh well...at least I make some plat then,
because I bound in Erud's Crossing and kill wisps to pass the time.

Perhaps, and I wouldn't mind if there was a "sense heading" skill for
figuring out directions on the run or during combat, but when you are
just standing around, you should be able to figure out your direction.

I deduce that in EQ your character has had considerable trainging
before level 1, by the fact that (casters, at least) you have spells,
and can immediately learn several more as soon as you can afford the
scrolls.  This indicates considerable specialization already, which I
presume comes from study and training.
