    No, he was finally /killed when a guild killed him in front of a GM at
the zone-in. All the adds pop inside the Pit, and only inside the Pit. The
encounter was completely gimped by warping him out. The only thing that
might have made him look perma-popped was all the patching. Trust me - the
untargettable version of RZ was not repopping after a RZ kill, or we'd have
farmed the thing to death.
