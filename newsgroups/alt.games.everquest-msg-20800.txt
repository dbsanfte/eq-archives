You're not poor. My bard is level 19 and, except for one occasion,
has never had more than 250pp in the bank. That's about right for a
non-twinked character at the late-teens, early-twenties.

Two bits of advice. First, look at where you are hunting. I'm a big
advocate of the Warrens because the loot is great. You wouldn't get
a lot of experience there (four or five named mobs, maybe, at your
level) but that you'd have no trouble "farming" the place for sellable
loot. Bronze in the range of 2-3pp drops regularly and it's not uncommon
to get bamboo bokkens that sell for nearly 7pp off of the higher-level
mobs (which would be green to you). You MIGHT be be able to
camp the Prince and get the Forlorn items he drops, but he might be
trivial to you at 25. (Warrens has special "anti-bottom-feeding" loot
rules.) Odds are, you wouldn't be depriving the newbies of their
loot because the zone is under-used due to its location. Last Saturday
morning, I was literally alone in the Warrens for a couple of hours.

Second, invest in yourself. I don't play a caster, so I can't make
a specific recommendation as to whether buying INT items is
the way to go. . I just know that when I reached a
certain point I realized I needed to spend my money on AC
because I was dying all of the time.  Every time I got 150 - 250
plat I bought a decent piece of armor (lambent in my case, from
bards upgrading to Singing Steel). I was broke for a while but
it paid off in being able to take on bigger mobs and so reap bigger
rewards. Hence, I still usually have only around 200 pp but the
time required to rebuild that wealth gets shorter and shorter.

Good hunting!
