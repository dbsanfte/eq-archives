I was on EQ toolbox a day or so ago, and they had DoN maps already.
(Apparently they made them available once non-disclosure ended.)
But when I went back there today I got some sort of error page; my
guess is they're swamped by people trying to download DoN maps. :-)

Incidentally, the new Atlas tab on the map window is sort of nice,
though sometimes a dungeon zone looks like it's between two zones
instead of hanging off of just one of them.  (E.g., Karnor looks
like it's connected to both DL and FV.)  I like the way I can use
it to check ahead of time whether I've already got a map installed
for a zone before I visit it.

Using the atlas I discovered that EQ toolbox's DoN pack doesn't
have all the new zones, but that's hardly surprising.
