Voice acting in EQ2 is the most likely thing to get me to try it.

For some reason, I had a hard time getting into quests in EQ.  I thought at
first that it was having to try to write down information on paper and then
keep track of it in my dark gaming room, and indeed, I did find quests a lot
nicer in games like DAoC, where they had a quest journal.

Still, there is just something about reading quest dialog that doesn't do it
for me.  It just doesn't stick in my mind, even with a journal.  I have no
trouble with fantasy literature, so it's not some weird reading problem on
my part--it just doesn't work for me in games.

I'm hoping that hearing quest information will somehow make it work better
for me.
