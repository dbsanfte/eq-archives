You can raise your research skill by making practice runes and then 
combining them.

However, it isn't the -only- way to do so.

For one thing, you can instead combine the actual components to make 
spells, and keep doing that until those spells become trivial, then move 
on to the next set of spells.  Given the difficulty and annoyance of 
finding the components for research rune making, this is not really any 
harder than doing the practice, and yeilds spells you can either use or 
sell in the bazaar.

However, there is an easier way than that.

Every time you level, you get 5 skill points.  There are almost no cases 
where these points are needed for something (you need them to start 
skills that you didn't get at level 1, like Dodge and so forth... but 
you only need to put -one- of your free skill points into each of those 
skills)

By an odd coincedence, your skill cap on research will also go up by 5 
points every level.

Get your skill to cap, then every time you level up, put all your 
training points into it so its capped again.

You'll save thousands of pp, hours of tedium, and several hundred 
dollars on blood pressure medication.

Its too late for you now, but you should note, in case you ever run 
another pure caster, that you when you put your first training point 
into a skill, it goes up to your level for that one point.  This means 
that if you buy the skill at level 15, you get it at 15.  But if there 
are no spells you need to research until level 24, then by waiting until 
24, you get an additional 9 training points free; put that one point in 
and your skill starts at 24.

As a  general rule, I'll also add that research itself is a difficult 
and annoying skill, one with little in the way of practical use unless 
you have access to a guild bank where components are stored up; actually 
finding all the components for a given spell on your own is highly 
unlikely, and they tend to be priced higher than the resulting spells if 
you find them at  all in the bazaar.  Dumpster Diving; hunting thru 
vendors for the things, is the only real hope, if you enjoy such things.

My mage is level 65, never sold a single researched spell, never did the 
research to make a spell for a single other person, and only researched 
about 5 spells over his entire life... despite capping out the skill and 
getting a geerlok automated quill.  I was interested, I put the effort 
in to be as ready as I could manage... but never ended up with  the 
parts needed to do anything interesting.
