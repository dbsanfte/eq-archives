Its possible to find groups of any level fairly easy,if you know which
zone the crowd goes,although in my experience it becomes harder 
from 55 up 65,because 55 is the point for most people when they retire
their alts because leveling takes exceptional longer from now on.

Soloabitlity(is that a word?) was always very good with certain
classes,now it has become laughable easy since they introduced
potions,just like in WoW.
I get invites for my Cleric when *not* looking for group,on the other
hand usually I can run around with one of my Rangers for hours with
lfg tag on and get nothing.
But I dont recommened Cleric for starters,its not fun to be poor.
Shaman,Enchanter,Bard are other classes which are in high demand
for groups,their soloability is somewhat better than Cleric,especially
Bards make nice soloers,but they are difficult to play in the sense
that they need a lot of concentration to be played efficiently,not
very good when you play 8 hours a day like me,but maybe nice for
a more casual player.

Making a Ranger,reading eqtraders.com,"fear kiting" animals and
"foraging" will easily keep you at the same level of gear as the
oldtimers.I use my 55 Ranger to "twink" my 66 Cleric and
have fun while doing so.
