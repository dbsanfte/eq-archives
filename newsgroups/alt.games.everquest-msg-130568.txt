Don't take this as a slam, LS, but I am convinced that you are still
in school..

High School, maybe.  College perhaps..

It is obvious that you haven't experienced "life" outside your very
limited, obviously very secure environment.

What you have described is war.  Plain and simple.

It's horrific and that is what makes it a thing to be avoided.

But "war" and "terrorism" are two different things. If it is war you
wish to discuss, then I can locate just as many "horrible" things done
by the Palestinians, the Americans, the British or anyone else in the
world.  The very nature of war makes such examples all to plentiful.

However, it is side-stepping the main issue of discussion.  Which is
terrorism.
