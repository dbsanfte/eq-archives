My level 17 Beastlord has spent all of his life in the same 3 zones on
Luclin, and he's ready to do some exploring. My question is, where to go?
This is my highest character, and my other 2 are both elves, so there is
alot of Norrath, especially Antonica, that I've never seen. My favorite part
of the game is exploring new zones, it makes the hack and slash worth it. So
any suggestions as to where I should head? My pet doesn't have a magical
attack, so I don't think I could handle Unrest. I was thinking maybe the
Warrens or Kunark somewhere. And one more thing, when you take a screenshot,
what directory is the file put in? Thanks in advance
