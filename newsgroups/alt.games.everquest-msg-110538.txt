Well, as the tradeskills guy was talking about the implementation
mistakes in EQ one he mentioned that at the fan faire. My take on it
was that the player made high end tradeskill items WOULD rival/be
better than drops. Looking at EQ1 my guess is that a person in a non
uber guild, soloing or grouping casually, would take the option of
buying pretty darn uber stuff from a tradeskill guy for a premium
price. The person in the uber time sink guild who could get his own
would have all that headache for gear which was better. 

Exactly as you say, for many players tradeskill stuff would have to be
reasonably better than what they can get for it to be viable to
purchase. It sounds like that is what they'd be shooting for. Star
Wars galaxies sounds the same way, support for a very active player
item making and selling community. EQ1 has taught them something they
did not know, THOUSANDS of people WANT to be a character who makes
good things to sell to other players. They really never counted on
that with EQ1 originally. Players want to be able to do that and to
gain from doing that instead of having to go out and kill stuff like
in EQ1. You toss them in the game with players who ONLY want to go out
and kill stuff for money then BUY items from that first group and it
works out very well.
