You need generalists for a 3 person group rather than specialists for a 6
person group.  With that in mind, the ideal combination is:

Monk: decent tank for all but the most extreme situation, solid damage
dealer, good puller, good CR.
Druid: Good healer, average buffer, poor debuffer, average nukes.  Teleport 
and sow.
Enchanter: Great buffer, great crowd control, good debuffer, poor nukes.

If you only fight outdoors, substitute a rogue for the monk.
