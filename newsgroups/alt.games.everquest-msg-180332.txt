I figure i come and ask here where i may find a Brainiac to tell me if this
can be done.

I was searching some data on yahoo search engine when i stumbled on that
link
www.poolproplus.com, a guy name Nick Nikolaidis will try on feb 15 to pot
17 000 pool balls in 24 hour. Holly christ!!!! So that is Speed Pool, it
takes me sometimes 40
minutes to play a game of pool and that is only 15 balls to sink. This guy
has the world record for clearing two rack in less than 2 minutes.

Man! this is nuts!!!!

5 sec per ball , 700 ball per hour, for 24hr, and that is not counting the
missing and racking.
DAMN!!

here is the link to the website where i saw the info.
