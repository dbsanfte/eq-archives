Grouping Bonus 

Following the next patch, the group bonus will be as follows: 

2 person group - 2% total bonus. 
3 person group - 6% total bonus. 
4 person group - 10% total bonus. 
5 person group - 14% total bonus. 
6 person group - 20% total bonus. 
This bonus is applied to the total experience reward for killing a creature 
prior to distributing it to the group.

also note that the group bonus existed prior to this

<quote source="Gordon Wrinn">
The grouping bonus before was 2% per additional group member, for 10% 
total. The first person doesn't count. Now, the first person still doesn't 
count, but the system goes up on a curve and caps at 20%.
