Your overall point may or may not be true.  The first attempt to support it
was *obviously* flawed and that was the point I was arguing.  The second
link cannot be immediately determined to be true or not true.  It has
conclusions that are at least written in a way that cannot be said to be
obviously biased, but does not show supporting data.  That by itself is not
normally critical, but when you present two 'studies' in the same post for
the same conclusion and one of them is BS, then we do have to be careful of
the other one.  I didnt argue it the first time because it is not likely we
will ever be able to see the data it was based on and for all I know it
might be good data and good conclusion.
