<Thud> Sound of jaw hitting the ground.
I thought that *everyone* had seen Blade Runner.
It is one of about 5 watchable *real* Sf films ever.
I.e. it is not pop sf like starwars or starship troopers (which are both
good in their own way), but is instead more akin to the "serious" side
like 2001 etc.

Rent it, then read the book (the original not the "screen play").
Dive into P.K. Dick's paranoia.
