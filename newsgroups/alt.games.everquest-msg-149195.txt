Dwarf never was one of the prevalent warrior races, you know. Not the
typical twink or minmax class. Also, Brellium can be worn by two
races, while Heraldic can be worn by four. And the reason they can't
wear heraldic isn't that they can't worship Rallos, but that they're
not human. Rallos worshiping ogres can't wear Heraldic either. But, a
dwarf has access to cultural stuff with the exact same stats as non
imbued heraldic, so it's not as if the access to ubersmithed stuff is
cut off forever, you know.
