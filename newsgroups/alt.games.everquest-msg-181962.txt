I have a 24th Human Monk, 24th Troll SK and 23rd Ogre Beastlord.  The
easiest to solo was the beastlord.  He was cake.  He could even take
on multiple yellows at once (fiends in Paladul Caverns).  The troll
soloed alot in Upper Guk.  There was alot of downtime for healing up
but it was doable.  He soloed better once he reached 20th and the
damage cap came off.  The monk, I haven't played in a very long time
(weeks prior to the monk nerf).  He didn't solo much as I could get
into groups with him pretty easily.  But the times he did, there was
lots of bandaging and waiting for Mend to come back.  IMHO, he soloed
the worst of the 3 classes.  If you go monk, definately go Iksar for
the regen.
