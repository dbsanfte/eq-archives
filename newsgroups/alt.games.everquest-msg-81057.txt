Halflings are vile abominations of nature and must be slain.  Their weak
gods shall tremble and fall to the might of Our Father, Innoruuk.  The
halfling that attacked you comes from one of three camps of foul invaders,
bent on claiming our forest as their own.

There is a small group in a druid ring on the Neriak side of the bridge.  Go
with a group and slay them.  Slay them all.
