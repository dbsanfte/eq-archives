Some wounds fester and need active therapy.

I'm assuming you're American here, as you don't mention which
constitution and the only countries mentioned in this thread are South
Africa and the US.

The US constitution does not, as such, make a blanket statement of
rights.  Hence the amendments, like the famous First Amendment.  Other
than the specific rights granted in the Amendments (including the Bill
Of Rights), most other "rights" Americans think they have are just
assumptions on their parts.  In order to minimize social injustice it
is, therefore, often required that governments entrench rights in law.
I suppose you could take someone to court for violating your "right"
to "liberty and the persuit of happiness", but I doubt the vague claim
would get you very far.   In an ideal world it might be enough to just
say "you can't discriminate", but that is just not practical, and so
we are left with a need to itemize types of discrimination.

Note that specifying a right is not in any way related to "affirmative
action meddling", as you put it.  For example, outlawing
discrimination on the basis of gender in no way favours the hiring of
women, and a person (male of female) who feels they have been
discriminated against on the basis of gender must still provide proof
of their complaint.  While there are no doubt many cases of people
abusing the law by claiming discrimination on spurious grounds, they
are greatly outweighed by those of have in fact been discriminated
agaisnt but are unable to prove it.

Other countries, like Canada, have a living constitution which has
been updated several times, both by governemnts and by the courts.
While I am not saying this is always a better system, it does have the
advantage the we have a single unambiguous definition of rights (at
least in theory).
