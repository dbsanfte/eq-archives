When SoL came out I was playing on a PIII 733 with 512 MB ram and a GeForce
2 GTS 64 MB vid card. Since then, I've built a new machine:

Asus P4TE
P4 1.8A
512 MB Rambus RAM
ATI Radeon 8500
etc...

My original intention was to use the GeForce2 in the main PC and relegate
the new Radeon 8500 to the old machine for use as a HTPC. I ended up putting
the Radeon in the game PC because it has a much crisper picture IMO. That
being said, it slightly outperforms the GeForce 2 in EQ at a resolution of
1280x1024 (my flat panel's native res).

PS - All models turned on, ground foliage turned on, HQ textures, spell
effects, low particle density, latest (beta) drivers, no tweaks. About the
only zone I pass through regularly that even gives me a little pause is
Twilight Sea...

Hope this helps.
