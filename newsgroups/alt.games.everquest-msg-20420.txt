I've never yet questioned someone about an inappropriate name and had them
claim ignorance of the policy. It has always been some variation of "They
can't tell me what to do"...five minutes before the server GM (I'm
fortunately blessed with a good one) changes it. His policy is that
inappropriate names get changed to variations of pet names. Makes it easy
to tell who has been an idiot in the past.
