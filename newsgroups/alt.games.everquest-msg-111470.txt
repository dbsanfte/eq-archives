    The ogre master smiths out there include a lot of warriors - can't see
why trolls would be too different. As per Yak's latest spin on how
tradeskills work (it changes every Fan Faire, it seems), skill gain in
smithing will be based off the higher of WIS or INT or STR. There's
apparently a small bonus to skill gain for exceptionally high WIS/INT that
he didn't mention being in place for high STR, but there you go.

    We're currently trying to figure out who should be our guild smith for
the stupidly-difficult-to-make Serubane metal sheets. We were going to use a
monk that had 200 Smithing and a +15% hammer, but the trivial is so high
(the monk is one for five on making these rare-drop-after-rare-drop sheets)
that we'll need to use someone that actually has 250 skill. The monk already
has capped Brewing from doing his Coldain ring quests, so he isn't an
option. :-/
