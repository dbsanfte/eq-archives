People are jerks, not classes or races.  I know what you're asking though.
If I had to generalize, and I hate to generalize, my list would be:

People who may be arrogant:
Clerics, Enchanters, Bards

People who may be Immature/powerhungry/cocky:
Warriors, monks

People who may be jaded/tired of being begged:
Druids, Shaman, Clerics

Anyway, there are different people in every class, but let's just say I've
run into my fair share of idiot warriors and bossy enchanters ;)  I also
know many great people from each class so this is really a pointless
exercise.
