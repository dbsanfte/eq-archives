When we raid I get the mob and /assist.  I find that I am usually healing
the person the mob has...usually a cleric.  Go figure.  Imagine targeting
the mob and finding yourself on the list...and you're dead before you can
heal yourself!  ;)

I have a hotkey w/ just /assist.  I hit F8 a lot and /assist the mob to see
who has aggro and I heal according to that.

Always keep the MA up.  When I am in the Complete Heal chain (CH chain), I
warn my group, "watch your aggro cuz I'm not healing ya!".  I have Divine
Arb 3 and have found that when I do that I like to fire off mgb Celestial
Regen.  That way, not only am I helping my grp, I like to think I'm helping
others in the raid as well.

Hope this helps.
