Yep, latest drivers. Soundblaster creative drivers 4.11.01.0711 (the
ones verant recommends on their website), Nvidia GeForce2MX/MX 400
drivers 4.13.01.2311 (off the Nvidia homepage, more recent than the one
verant lists on their site), DirectX 8.1 (4.08.01.0881)

20.GB drive with 13.3GB free, optimized last night.

Hmm, I do have EQ set to autolog and some of the files are pretty big. I
have seen this problem with characters we seldom play (which therefore
have very small log files); but I'll rename them and turn it off and see
if that helps.

Sound is off; I use nosound.txt. I have also turned off all Luclin
models, turned down the clip plane, turned off spell effects (all that
stuff you do before a dragon raid to reduce lag /grin) to no apparent
avail.

I do notice this problem seems more likely to occur in some zones than
others. Upper Guk, Oasis, Cazic Thule, and Eastern Wastes have all bad
for it for me.
