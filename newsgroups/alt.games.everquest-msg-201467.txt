    The Tae Ew Two Hand Hammer should be very cheap, as it's player-made and
the stuff needed to make it is quite common. I think it has 100 HPs, too....
Yup, here it is! 34/35 2HB, 6 STR/INT/WIS, 100 HPs, 25 MANA, 14 PR/DR,
weight 5.5, required level 51. It's a one-temper item, and some
vendor-bought smithing stuff. On my server, the bloods required go for 2000
pp and 500 pp each, so the cost to the smith is a smidge over 2500 pp with a
50% plus success rate. So net cost to smith is 5 K or less, look for pricing
in the 7500 pp to 10 K pp range. That cheap enough for a 1:1 ratio two
hander with 100 HPs and some resists? ;-)

    Player-crafted, from drops in Plane of Tactics that are single-group
obtainable. On my server, for comparison, Bloodmetals are 30 K where
Mosquito Leg Earrings are 20 K. Required level 46, recommended level 60
(which is why I show odd stats for your 53 monk). At level 60+, the full
stats are: 7 AC 12 STR 8 STA 6 AGI 70 HP 40 MANA 15 MR and a weight of 0.3.
