Just because a bunch of people use the same strategy does not mean it is the
only strategy.

Also if you want me to illustrate just how bad the common knowledge is in
this newsgroup you have to look no father then the thread ~how should I use
my training points.

Some of what passes for people that know what they are doing here, matter of
fact some of the very people that are arguing with me about this, gave the
WORST shit eating advice I have ever seen passed out.

Now do you want me to take something that they have to say as authorative
after they blew it so badly? Isn't going to happen.

In other words, you can not find any posts where necros are going HP/AC and
your statement to that effect was total bullshit.

Thanks for playing. I will just put you in my list of bullshit artist.

Have a nice day, I am done with you.
