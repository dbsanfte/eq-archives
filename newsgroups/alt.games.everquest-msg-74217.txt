Oh oh, I think I know why this is.. its an old thing that you don't
see names over necro player heads in skel form or over pets. What
happened was since the new skel model is pretty much the same as they
get, they made some kind of mistake and don't have the name showing
over any of them. 

I'd post this to the dev board and be very specific about what is
happening and how it is different with the change to the new model.
