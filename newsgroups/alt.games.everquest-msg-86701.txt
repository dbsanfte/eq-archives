    My memory is fuzzy, but I believe the mob in the cell will not assist/be
assisted by Dyrna and Flayer. You may want to look up some quests on
Allakhazam's first - one of the mobs you mentioned is one of the folks you
need to kill for an Erudin quest to stop a bridge being built from the
maninland to Erudin.
