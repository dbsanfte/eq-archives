That's what I meant by dogma... You are putting forth a series of 
statements that are expected to be accepted as self-evident without 
question; but you still need to explain how the concept of free will 
gives rise to meaning, when free will is undistinguishable from the lack 
of free will in a deterministic universe. Hell, it may even help if you 
explained what you meant by "meaning", because in the way I understand 
it, "meaning" being a purely subjective notion, both free will and a 
sufficiently convincing illusion of free will would result in exactly 
the same amount of meaning. That it may have been pre-ordained by 
causality does not really change anything.
