2 types of pets to consider -

Summoned pets and charmed pets.

For summoned pets - if the pet does 100% of
the damage he gets 75% of the xp (this is
bad :)  If anyone in the group does just 1 point
of damage the pet takes none.

This is a marked change to the old rule, where
it was necessary to outdamage the pet to prevent
him from taking xp.  (we cheered this change
loudly on the Tower)

For charmed pets it's a bit different.  They
take from 0% to 50% of the xp based on how
much of the damage they do.  I don't know the
exact ratio - but I'd guess it's linear (IE
XP% = Damage%/2)
