Kuloth,

Just wanted to interject - the part I didn't snip, above, is what impressed
me most.

You did a damn fine job, don't get me wrong.  You stepped up to the plate,
you saved your raid from a possible wipe, you covered everything.  I expect
that of every competent tank, though.

But when the MT was back, you shined.  Because you didn't get big ego, you
didn't say "I've tanked him this far, I'll finish it," you didn't fight the
MT for aggro.  You recognized what was best for everyone, and even if it
wasn't fun you did it with grace and style.  THAT is unexpected, and rare.

Kudos, Kuloth.  Be proud, you've earned it.

Frosty
