The top content in velious was not defeated just as the next expansion 
came out.

After SOV, we had SOL, POP, LOY and LDoN before the top content in SOV 
was defeated.

Of course, to my mind it was cheating to make that content spawnable 
only once per server ever, meaning that only those who rushed to try it 
(and probably were unready) were even able to attempt it.

And then it was cheating again to allow two tries at it on the server 
that did finish the job.  I'll bet he'd have been beaten long before if 
other servers had been given a second chance.

Splendid
