Gfay is a terrible newbie zone. Butcherblock is even worse. And going
to freeport defeats the idea of staying around your own kind while you
learn the ways of the world.

Go to steamfont. It's the only newbie zone on faydwer worth anything.
I am talking around the steamfont druid rings, not near ak'anon
entrance.
