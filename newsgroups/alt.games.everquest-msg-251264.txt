Well, the summit seems to have had an effect rather quickly. Whilst a lot of
the changes mean nothing to me, some of them I can see right away as being
handy (pok book to gunthak, hooray! regen increased for some druid spells,
huzzah!) and I hope that few mobs warp or go underground now. I hate
watching a spider in veks running towards me, then disappear to backstab...
bit like the phase spiders in D&D!

I don't know what the game is like at the GoD level but it seems like if I
was at that level, I'd be happy with the new spell drop system etc. I can't
wait to read mobhunter's latest comments and the inevitable bitching 8-)
