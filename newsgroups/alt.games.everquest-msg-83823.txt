I haven't played everquest for months now, then I start up again only to
find Everquest has the same old crappy lame players as always.  You help
someone who is getting tripled teamed from dieing, then the next time you
help them your accused of stealing her kills.  I'm thinking to myself, oh
jee... how appreciative she is for my help.

So I tell myself next time I won't help her...  and of course she gets
double teamed on her next attempt, and has to run.

I swear most of the people in this game have the brain the size of a pea.
Just stuck up bitches.  And all it does is remind me of why I stopped
playing this game before.
