If you are getting a "new" system with ME on it, then the only thing you
will loose is the drivers and whatever software that comes with the system,
which you should get the disks for with the system.

A few little bits of info here. First, you will need to download the W98
drivers for the system components (the ME drivers may not work).

Second, if it is a "used" system, you'll want to format it and get rid of
everything on it anyway, just to be sure you aren't getting something you
don't want, eg a virus.

Installing W98 will be a snap if you already have the W98 boot disk and CD.
just put the CD in the drive and put the boot disk in and restart the
computer. When prompted let windows reformat the drive and begin installing
W98.
