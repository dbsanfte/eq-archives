  Whether or not war is fun in real life makes no difference about whether
or not it's fun in games.  In a game, real people don't die and the wounds
don't cause pain.  Without pain and death, war probably wouldn't be all that
unpleasant.

  Obviously some people find the RvR in DAoC a fun and stimulating
challenge, else nobody would bother playing.  I don't see any reason why
superior numbers, power or the element of surprise and good planning would
not yield a significant advantage in a game.  In a game where numbers are to
your advantage, I'd imagine part of the challenge is convincing a large
number of people to act in concert towards a single goal... which tends to
be a rather difficult prospect in itself.  A group which succeeds in doing
this deserves and advantage and perhaps a victory.
