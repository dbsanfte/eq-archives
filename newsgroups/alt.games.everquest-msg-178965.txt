Ok, distinction noted. Since the actual damage inflicted is typically higher
than the base damage of the weapon (this is based on anecdotal observations,
I'm not familiar with the calculation), it would seem that it would
therefore be much better to have a 13/25 than a 10/25 that adds 3 damage
each hit. Would you agree? Is there some other aspect to this worth
mentioning?

Not sure what you mean here. Are you saying that two different characters
looking at the same weapon could potentially see different damage bonuses
because the bonus is based on character differences and not inherent in the
weapon?

Ah, there's a distinction I haven't been aware of. I've been considering
"non-aggro" (forgive the term, I'm still getting used to EQ terminology) any
mob that I could walk up to and not get attacked. How is this different from
KOS? If I'm am KOS, doesn't this simply mean that once I'm within the mob's
aggro radius, there's the potential that I will get attacked by it? There's
apparently a lot more subtlety to this than I am aware of, could you (or
anyonre reading this thread) provide details, please?

Ahh, interesting. So I can attack these frogs without concern regarding the
Guk issue. There may of course be other issues that come up (like the new
froglok race starting town faction ...)

Thanks!

Hey, what happened to the slightly eccentric, rail-gun totin' kitty cat?
