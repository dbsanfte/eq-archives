Oh come on.  I love THE BIG LEBOWSKI, it's a great movie, but all the
other Cohen brothers movies are better.  Hell, I'd vote for RAISING
ARIZONA (FARGO was a technically superior movie, but RA was just more
fun and had more heart, IMHO) as the best Cohen Bros film LONG before
I'd vote for LEBOWSKI.

My All Time Favorite movie would have to be, right now, MEMENTO.
Coming out on DVD in a couple of weeks.  Go buy it now.  It rocks.

Close second, A TOUCH OF EVIL.  Definitely Orson Wells best movie, to
hell with CITIZEN KANE.

OB-EQ, How hard is it to get from Mid 80's in tailoring to say 120's.
From what I see on EQTraders, it's pretty damned dire.
