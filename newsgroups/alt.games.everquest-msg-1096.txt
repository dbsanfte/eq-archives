Ok, I'm just dying for the answer to this:

How are the constant spewings of an attention craved moron who persists in
stalking people across all posts in the newsgroup while contributing
nothing productive about (or even vaguely related to) everquest somehow

large amounts of useful information?

Please use as many words of whatever size you feel most comfortable with,
as I am looking for as much possible detail to this as possible.
