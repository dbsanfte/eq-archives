you're right . .. this change happened exactly as you describe it, maybe a
few months ago (maybe more)

i'm glad i'm not the only one who remembers the other way it went


however - if you wandered from your group, found a non-green and killed it
w/o any help from your group, you do still get exp . .. if you're not in
range of your group, you get full - BUT - if you are in range, does it get
split? i just realized i don't know . . .
