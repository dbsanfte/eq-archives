I should have told you how to get there in the original post.  But, in
Windows 98, go into Device Manager/Disk Drives/Choose the hard drive
here/Properties/Settings tab/ and there in Options you will have check
boxes.  If your drive supports DMA, then you will have a box beside DMA you
can click to put a check in.  If it is not, you won't be able to change it.
hope that helps a little more...
