right..just because the zone is 58+ doesn't mean a mob couldn't be blue to
someone at 52. I haven't ventured too far into the zone myself, and when I did,
I was 59/60, so I can't attest to the "blueness" of mobs at 52, so if this is
actually incorrect, I apologize in advance.

on the flip side of that coin, just because mobs might con blue to you at 52
doesn't mean necessarily that the zone is appropriate for your level.
