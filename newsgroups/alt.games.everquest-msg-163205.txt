    50%. Vs. the 58% on the VoG every melee drools over. And were this
fellow to level up, he'd find it quite easy to rake in the AA XP that he
wants.

    So shouldn't that tell the fellow that levelling up is a good idea?

    I beg to differ. I can tell the difference between just my own mana
regen buffs (I have shoulders that cast a mana regen buff, too), my own +
C3/4, my own and SD/SP, and my own and C3/4 + SD/SP. XP grinding takes place
over hours, not minutes. Over one hour a difference of 7 points of mana
regen (SP) translates into 4200 mana, or an entire bar of mana for me
roughly. My personal mana regen is 25 (base) + 6 (BAotR) + 2 (LW) + 1 (MC1)
+ 7 (FT) = 41 mana/tick. SP is nearly a 20% increase on that. As a tank,
would you not get a FBSS when you had no haste because the effect is only
20%, which is "nothing"?

    Under par? How so? I guess I don't understand why you'd reject grouping
with a BST and pulling at a fine rate (in my experience, 1 AA per 2.5 hours
versus 1 AA per 2 hours with SHM/ENC) compared to sitting on your ass and
waiting for a SHM/ENC to come along.
