All the basic components are tradable.  However, every MADE component (vial,
fired vial, final potion) is NoDrop.   So:  Plat becomes a non-issue.

The only thing that affects a KoS person is needing to talk to Frundle (or
whatever) to get the Purifier itself.  Sneak will bypass the faction side,
but probably not if you're KoS.
Everything else can be done at any wheel and kiln anywhere.

The port spot, btw, is the dead middle of the bridge nearest the zoneline to
GD.  I've used probably a half-dozen potions now.  I'm not KoS but I believe
that you'd pop in outside of the archer's agro range.
