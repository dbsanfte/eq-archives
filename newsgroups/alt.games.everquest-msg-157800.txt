I disagree completely.

It's not that he's friends with the guildleader, it's that he's very
probably contributed to the guild in the past. You simply CAN'T award
loot on a raid-by-raid basis. Say you wanted a CoF from Naggy, and
attended 20 raids, saw 2 drop and passed to people you thought would get
more benefit. Then another one dropped. You think that should go to an
invite on their first raid, just because they got their earlier that
day? ...and *I'm* the one not being serious?

You are given consideration. FUTURE consideration. In a guild, you
CANNOT look at raids in isolation. If you do, people will only show up
to raids where they have something to gain, right? The people in the
guild had obviously been to more raids than you in the past 3 months, so
how do you think their overall contribution compares to yours on your
first raid?

Stop thinking about YOURSELF and think of the GUILD. A single Blade of
Carnage from AoW will effect the raiding ability of the guild
considerably more than 5 hours worth of exp on a chanter.

erm... exactly that, yes.

How many items does a mob drop? 3 if you're lucky?
How many mobs will they kill in 2 weeks? 10 if there isn't too much
competition?

So, I make that 30 items if they're lucky during that 2 week period. I
hate to break this to you, but even in a raiding guild, 2 weeks solid
effort usually results in..... NO LOOT.

I'm an officer in the server's uberguild, regular main tank, and often
go a 3, 4, 5 weeks without looting anything.

You, sir, are a loot whore.

No self respecting guild would invite someone who whines about not
getting loot on their first raid, let alone feels they are justified in
it.
