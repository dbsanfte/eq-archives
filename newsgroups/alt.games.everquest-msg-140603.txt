Verant were emailling people with an account key and free months play to try
and get people to take up second accounts.
Not sure what mailing list you needed to be on to get one, I never
did...then again I am paying for 3 accounts already so I wouldn't be in a
rush for a 4th. I have no idea what was enabled on this account, I assume
only the original game, no expansions. This is probally what you heard
about.
It would make sense if Verant sold account Keys to existing customers. Just
for convenience, it can be an absolute bitch finding copies of EQ (in the
UK) when it is between expansions/Promotional packs, AFAIK they have yet to
do this.
