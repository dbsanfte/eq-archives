Force feed rations / water until you can't take any more.
I have in:
slot 1: one misty thicket picknic
Slot 2: one grobb liquidized meat
Slot 3: stack of food
slot 4: stack of water
slot 5: balance of picnics
slot 6: balance of grobb liquidized meat

That way if things are getting crazy and I forget to force feed I'm only going
to waste *one* picnic and *one* tea.
