One day you will wake up and realise there are no *normal* people, everyone
has their own idiosyncrasies and failings. It would be a safe bet that there
is not a single 100 percent sane person on the planet (if you just waived
you hand in the air and said "I am perfectly sane" then that is a pretty
damn good indication that your not), so I guess that means we are all
surviviors.

But then again, isn't that the whole point of life? To survive, to pass on
your genes? So, what's the problem?

Your proberly just pissed you can't get EQ to work on your webTV...
