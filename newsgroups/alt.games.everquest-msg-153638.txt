Do the mail run from Ak'Anon and Felwithe to Kelethin. You'll ding 4 in no time
and get level-decent plat in the process. Take the "bard shuttle" back to
Ak'Anon after the turnins to save time.

I rolled up a gnome cleric (of Bertoxx!) just to see if this would work. It was
so much fun I've decided to keep him around to do the newbie armor quests.
