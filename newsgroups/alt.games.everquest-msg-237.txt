Yes, you are evil! (lol)

Actually, I believe only the first transfer was actually a true
transgression of the EULA. As far as your daughter, I don't think she's even
supposed to be playing at 9 yrs. old. Had she tried to sign up on her own
and entered her birthdate, she would not have been granted an account
because she is under 13 (?). I believe that transferring an account to a
minor in your family does not violate the EULA.

Now, purists would say that you did in fact break the end-user agreement by
giving the account to your girlfriend. Other may suggest that she should
have set up the account with her personal and billing information and then
let you level up her character. But then the purists would have pointed out
that that would mean sharing the log-in name and password, which also breaks
the EULA.

Finally, there are some here who will say that what you did doesn't amount
to anything, but the fact that you posted this possibly controverial topic
here was only done so to start (yet another) flame war. By "yet again", I do
not mean that you personally have started other flaming threads, but that
there have been an abundance of them lately.

Anyway, my thoughts on how you may have or may not have violated the EULA
are mine, and mine alone. If I have interpreted the EULA incorrectly, please
forgive me. In either case, I hope the three of you enjoy your new accounts.

I know we are told not to transfer the game or account to anyone however I
HAVE DONE IT!!!

I AM GUILTY -

I purchased the game and played a character until level 5. I then
transferred it to my girlfriend!
Will I be punished??!!

I also did the same and gave that one to my daughter. Am I to believe that a
9 yr old child must purchase this game on her own and use her OWN credit
card to pay for it!!

What about the girlfriend who refused to play unless I made it easier for
her by getting her the first few levels?

Does that mean I am evil?!??
