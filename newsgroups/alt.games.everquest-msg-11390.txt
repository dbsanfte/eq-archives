The Shin Lord is listed in the beastiary as a 31st level paladin. He also has
some paladin skills. I was in there on Saturday helping a guildmate camp him
for the GB. (six or seven Shin Lords, six or seven rusty short swords.
Grrrrr.) He can cast lay on hands, so I'm believeing he's a Pally. That or
he's one REALLY fast healer on occasion.
   As to doing a quest from him, that's just great unless you happen to have
already killed nearly a thousand of the little bastards, and AFAIK, there is
no way to raise froglok faction back up.
