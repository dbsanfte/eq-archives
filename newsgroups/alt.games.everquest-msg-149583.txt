Honestly, no, I can't tell. Usually. If I did notice a drop and the rogue
wasn't saying anything about it, I'd want to kick him and throw him on the
no group for joo list.

But we grouped with a rogue for much of Jakugg/Tiru's career. Orlun DID
practice his pickpocketing. He told us he was doing it. And he often /split
the proceeds with us. We also let him be masterlooter in most situations. He
never too advantage of us.

An honest rogue can be a very good friend and groupmate.
