Well said. The best games give people options to play how
they want to play. Not all people are alike.

You should be able to solo if you want to solo. Some days I can
only play for an hour at a time. Not worth it to try and find a group
to hunt in just to leave it soon after.

There is a person in my guild that doesn't have a character over 20.
And he's been playing 3 years like I have. He likes just starting new
characters and just interacting and role-playing with people.

The other 'best' games I have all have options for play:
Single player, multi-player, Skirmish mode, Co-op play, Vs mode,
random map, Deathmatch, teamplay, Campaign scenarios,
Single one shot scenarios, Map and scenario editors,
Player made Mods, etc. These are the games that stay on
my HD the longest.

Bottom line is it should not matter to Verant what people are
doing when they play, all that matters is that they play.
