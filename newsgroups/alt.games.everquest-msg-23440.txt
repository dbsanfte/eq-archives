I have heard that on some systems, switching back to EQ, then hitting F10
to change the display will work.  The inability to switch back to EQ after
getting out is by design, and has not changed in a patch recent or
otherwise.  There are programs out there that will allow you to run an
application in a window that would not otherwise run in a window,  this
allows you to switch in and out of EQ.  I don't know if there are any that
work win win2k, it hasn't been enough of an inconvenience (well, at least
not since I yanked out my windows keys) to investigate this any further.
