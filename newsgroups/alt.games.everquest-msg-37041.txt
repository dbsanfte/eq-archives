There's an archive of pretty much all the third party utilities kicking
around (although it doesn't have Pasketti's excellent utilities - must
nag 'em about that). You can find it at
http://eq.rpgutils.com/utilities.php

The stuff there is often out of date but there are links to the
developers' sites.

That page lists a few programs that might be the one you're looking for:
