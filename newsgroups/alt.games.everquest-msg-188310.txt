Don't worry, Annie, it's not that bad.  Just train a point in them at the 
guildleader, then group with a friend, select the language from the 
drop-down menu you get by clicking on the top bar of the chat window, and 
spam each other in /g with the new languages until you gain a point in 
each.  Then zone and repeat until you go insane.

It may be a bit difficult to find the guildleader who trains in Farsi.  He 
was last seen in the bottom drawer of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a 
disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying, "Beware of the Leopard".
