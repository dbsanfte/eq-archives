There are certain zones or doors in the game which you can't enter or 
open unless you have what the game calls a character flag; an entry on 
the database for your character indicating he's done a certain thing.

Flagging a player.. is impossible.  Player is the person sitting at the 
computer keyboard playing the game.

Flagging a character, though, is the process of getting him thru 
whatever is required to get that character flag mark.

In the case of POJustice trials, for example, you have to:

Go to Maviun down in the back of the Jail and talk to him (get "pre 
flag", a mini flag indicating you've had that conversation)
Be in a group which kills a "boss mob" at the end of one of the trials 
(most people do Trial of Execution, but any of them will do) and loot a 
Mark of whatever (Execution, in the case of the Trial of Execution), 
then show this mark to the justice mob that sent you in after him and 
talk to him a bit and get another preflag, then go back down to Mavuin 
and talk to him, finally getting your actual Flag.

Now your character can get into the Planes of Valor and of Storms even 
if they aren't 55 yet, and additionally will be correctly flagged to get 
into higher zones later, where just being high level is not sufficient.

There are dozens of flags in the game, and likewise there are quite a 
few Keys, which are similar but which end up getting you an actual 
physical (well virtually) item used to enter a zone or pass a door.

Feign Death is an ability monks have, and a spell which necromancers and 
Shadowknights have, which allows them to lie down on the ground as 
though dead, at which point mobs stop trying to kill them.

At low levels, the mobs forget immediately that the monk ever existed, 
and if not KOS or outside aggro range, the monk (or other FD person) can 
stand back up with no consequences.  Later, many mobs will end up 
'remembering' the monk if he stands up before they wander back to their 
starting position.

At any rate, FD is generally used to help split mobs; to turn an 
instance where several mobs come running whenever aggroed, into one 
where you can get just one (or only a few) at a time.  Lots of tricks 
exist for making this work, the simplest is just to FD when you fail to 
get just one, and try again from a slightly different position.  If you 
have Snare, though, (monks generally don't), you can very easily pull a 
group, snare one, FD, the rest move back home and the snared one just 
stands there, stand back up, pull if needed, and bring it home.

Thats a very brief tutorial, there's plenty more to it than that, but 
its a start.
