Well, EverQuest has a subscription model, so basically after you buy the 
box and install the game, you need to have a credit card (or a Sony game 
card) handy in order to create an account. The subscription is $10 per 
month, with the first month free.

The best advice for someone starting out would be to read the starting 
guides in a place like http://eq.castersrealm.com 

While they are not perfect, they are a pretty good starting point. Find a 
class/race combo that excites your imagination (don't worry about what 
class is the "best"... The classes in EQ are as well balanced as they are 
likely to be in a game of this nature), log in and start killing rats and 
bats. You'll soon be hooked.

One piece of advice: DON'T BEG. Everyone likes a true newbie, and there is 
a good chance that older characters will help you out with money and 
equipment *as long as you don't ask for it*. In EQ, everyone hates a beggar.

Have fun!
