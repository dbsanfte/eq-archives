Hmmm...

They sound like titles of Clive Barker novels.

What is the unifying theme behind your guild? Are you Nightmare Runes? Are
you seeking the Nightmare Runes? Do you worship the Spirits of the Forest?
Are you all somehow forest spirits? Do you walk like dragons or do you take
dragons for walks?

One of the reasons I joined Silvermist Wolves (thanks for the reccomendation
Lowky, having a great time!) was because the name had a quiet dangerousness
to it. It's a group that doesn't force it's presence onto Norrath, but will
appear from out of nowhere to help or harm (depending on the situation).
