Some of my fondest early EQ memories involve those epic "king-of-the-
hill" battles on Orc Hill. :)

I also remember reaching various points in my characters' lives where
I would hear of a great place to hunt and maybe enjoy a chance at a
modest gear upgrade of some sort, and I would pull up stakes and
journey to that location, seek a bind nearby and work toward
continuing to develop my character, learning the tactics of the area.

I remember tradeskills actually being worth doing. People actually
bought banded and fine plate armor from me. I had a blast taking
orders from players and helping out the occasional lower level player
with the items I would craft just for skillups.

I remember countless hours haggling in the auction zone (on my server)
of West Freeport and loving every minute of it.

I remember when classes were diverse. If you wanted a port and weren't
a porting class, you bartered with one. If you wanted a rez and
weren't a rez'ing class, you bartered with one. If you needed your
corpse summoned and weren't a corpse summoning class, you bartered
with one. If you opted for a class with none of those "money-making"
abilities, you enjoyed greater utility, damage or tanking capabilities
for your sacrifice. If you chose to be a priest with more diverse
talents, it was at the expense of some healing capabilities. Likewise,
if you elected to be the best at any given role, you knew you were
giving up a lot of secondary abilities to be the best. Classes were
distinct. There was a strong reason for playing them all, and they all
worked together and complimented each other. If the best tank you had
was a ranger or monk, you made lemonade and worked with it rather than
sitting around bitching about not being able to find a plate class to
reduce the risk.

I remember when people were passionate about playing the game, rather
than just blowing through the levels and heading for the Bazaar.

At some point - or more likely it was a gradual decline (slippery
slope) - EQ became less a multi-player Elder Scrolls type of
experience and more a superficial interactive chat room for the short
attention span. Oh, I realize full well that in many ways I can still
play it in a manner that appeals more to me, but the signal to noise
ratio is just at an all time low anymore. Plus, EQ "old school"
requires a much greater level of player commitment to one another than
is readily found among much of today's player base.

In spite of all the warts, however, I've played just about every
MMORPG under the sun, and EQ is the only one that keeps me coming
back. I think I'm just the Norrath version of those grumpy old dudes
in the opera house on the Muppet Show (dating myself a bit there, I'm
sure). ;)
