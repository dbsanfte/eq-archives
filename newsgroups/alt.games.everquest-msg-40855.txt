This might be too low.  Paladins can avoid damage
by Rooting the mob and backing off, Stunning the
mob and backing off, Fearing undead mobs off of them,
or blinding the mob with Flash of Light then stepping
back.

In fact, in a group fight, Flash of Light followed
by backing off is about as fast and reliable as
the Rogue's ability to Evade (except against highly
magic-resistant mobs), which you gave a "9" rating
for damage avoidance and called "godly".  Furthermore,
Flash of Light works just about as well as a "disengage"
strategy when fighting solo, whereas the Rogue
Evade skill is useless in a solo situation.  On
the downside, it can cause trains in a crowded
dungeon when used as a solo strategy.


>Root: 5

Why only 5?  Paladins get Root and Enstill.


>Buffing: 4, minor buffs

You might want to bump this up a couple of notches.
While Paladin buffs are inferior to Cleric buffs, they're
pretty nice in their own right, especially at higher levels.


>Corpse Recovery: 5

What exactly does this category cover?  5 might be too
high, unless you're counting the ability to IVU into
undead areas, and/or being able to absorb damage well enough
to run into dangerous dungeons and drag a corpse back out
without dying a second time by sheer HP and AC.


>Solo ability: 3, paladins are rather stinky soloists, maybe boost this to 4
>against undead

Actually, boost it a *lot* at higher levels.  My paladin couldn't
solo worth a damn in his 30's, but has done almost nothing but
solo from 46-53 (and done it very effectively), whereas other
"tank" classes would have a hard time doing so.

>vox book in particular. Also have to work on the epic your whole life
>(soulfire, ghoulbane, etc)

Is "3" a low difficulty, or high?  That is, would a "10" be
ultimate difficulty, or ultimately easy?  If "10" is easy,
then "3" is indeed about right for the Paladin epic, it's
a real drag to get.

Other than the above comments, which are minor, you've done a 
good job on the Paladin ratings.
