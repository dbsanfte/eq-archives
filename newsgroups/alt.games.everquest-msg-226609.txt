Interesting. I haven't tried SOE betas, but elsewhere I have been hit 
and miss for betas (excluding the free-for-all public beta like the 5 
day one just before AC2 came out), with as many hits as misses.

Interesting take on it; and I wouldn't be irritated by that promo, as 
you've stated it.

Why?

1) Getting Coke XXX a month later is in fact the same product. I'm not 
convinced the same is strictly true of EQ2 and the beta. There are 
intangibles that are derived from the beta that can be applied to the 
full product to give you an 'advantage' if you will.

2) Far more importantly: Motivation of the seller.

I know the gas-station-01 is trying to lure customers away from the 
competition with this promo... but the product is gasoline.

I find it highly unlikely that people are going to be pumping 8 gallons 
into *someone elses* car to get a 6-pack.

I also have no nagging suspicion that the gas station is trying to prop 
up the sales of inferior gasoline by tapping into coca-curiosity.

With SOE I *do* have the nagging suspicion that the promo is to try to 
make a quick buck off people who are sooooo curious about the beta that 
they'd be willing to consider forking over 50.00 bucks to get in.

And rather than try to just baldly charge 50.00 bucks a slot they've 
thrown in a product which essentially costs them nothing. (Given the 
lack of enthusiasm for LoE... how many LoE sales were cannibalized by 
bundling it with the 50.00 EQ2 slot? Few in my opinion.

But even though the average EQ1 player hungrily eyeing the EQ2 beta has 
little interest in LoE they're 'mesmerized' by the deal... its not just 
an EQ2 beta for 50.00 I also get LoE "a 50.00 value"...

It is sort of, if not exactly, like restaurant 'supersizing'. It causes 
an extremely large number of perfectly rational people who already can't 
finish their fries and drink to pay another 50 cents for 30% more of 
each... not because they want more, or can even use more, but because 
they are getting a 'better deal'.

So I contend bundling LoE with EQ2 betas is an attempt to play on that 
'better deal' psychology to push through a 50.00 EQ2 beta slot 
transaction (same price for a beta as a full game), that players would 
reject out of hand if were presented bald like that.

In further response to the gas station analagy.

1) If the coke-station charged an additional dollar per gallon over the 
competition. The customer would see straight through it and correctly 
compute that they were paying 8.00 for previewing the 6-pack... and 
would decide whether to patronize the station based on that.

2) If the coke-station charged the same dollar per gallon as the 
competition, then he would estimate the 6-pack would be valued at 4.00 
or whatever a six pack of any other pop goes for, and the customer would 
realize that meant he was effectively paying less per gallon (0.50 cents 
less if he were astute)... and would probably decide that its a better 
value than shopping at another station, provided he drinks pop.

When applied to the EQ situation however it doesn't quite line up. In 
every case the base assumption is that the customer wants/needs 8 
gallons of gas, and he's choosing which to buy based on the price & 
promos. With LoE that simply isn't the situation... there simply aren't 
lots of EQ1 players standing at ebgames weighing the various RTSes 
choosing which to buy based on the price & promos. In cases where one is 
then its a fair promo... but most of the people evaluating this promo 
would buy no RTS at all, but for the EQ2 beta promo....  that changes 
the dynamic of the transaction quite a bit, and it supports my argument 
that semantically its really buy EQ2 beta for 50.00 and get a free RTS 
for most people.
