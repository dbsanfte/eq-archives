Ok, I take it back.  I missed that the original poster postulated
allowing you to have the chosen command execute "after a 
user-programmable amount of inactivity from the client".

Yes, if that's how it were implemented, you could probably get a
lot of mileage out of your "pause 12 seconds then DA" script.

I was thinking less about what the OP had on his wishlist and more
about how SOE would probably actually implement such a feature.
And I doubt it would be any more complicated than "if the server
detects you're LD, it will at that point follow the strategy
you've preselected from a short list of options".

That would be nice, but I'd be happy if they'd just have the
server give an LD 59+ Paladin enough brains to Celestial Cleanse
himself as needed...  I've lost count of the number of times
I've been soloing a mob that was 100% safe with a few CC self-heals,
then gone LD and had the game be too stupid to have me do anything
but die.

LD Clerics reliably CHeal themselves, why are LD Paladins
so inept?
