Hey, just because you can't play one.  Actually they are a difficult class
to play, but they get better the more you play them and the more you learn
to use their advantages over the 'many' weaknesses they have.  A lot of
people play one for about 20 levels, then just pass them off as no good.
Fact is after about 22 and definitely after 30 is when Paladins start to get
a lot better, and even right into the 50s I am told by many 60level Pally's
are still great.  And SoL is only going to improve this.  It is really only
on high end raids they miss out a lot, something which I hope Verant will
address in SoL - or at least before I am the level to go high end raiding
:-).

Don is right, they are hard to play, but played right they I think can be
the most rewarding to play.
