I'm only a level 39 druid, but I can easily agree with this already. At many 
points of my career I have easily seen my inability to act as a main healer. 
About the only time I can do decently well at it is with a c3. Given our total 
mana in relation to how much mana our healing takes and how little it heals (all 
compared to a cleric) it is easy to see why clerics are better group members for 
this task.
