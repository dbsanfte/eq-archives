You have to enter you own new weapons. I don't think Copeland is
ever going to update it again. Also, remember that Copeland's is so
old now it does not include any of the recent changes to the game.
Like the newer damage tables for the Melee classes and the better
bonus for 2 handed weapons. So take it with a grain.
