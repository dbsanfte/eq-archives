Recent guild board conversation was about twinking. Specifically my
latest character race/class combo's I'm trying out on two servers and
their corresponding nice (or lack of) gear, depending which server
they're on. Some of our young members started the typical whining about
"well, you've got x, y, and z, so...".  I let them know that the fastest
leveling one I had was on the new server and totally untwinked with any
gear at all for 18 levels, and then only some very low end gifts at that
point. The best thing a new character can have in their "account" is
knowledge of how to play the fucking game, which you can't buy on e-bay
for all the money in the world. One of the biggest lessons that seems to
take the longest for some slowpokes to learn, (like me, for instance) is
the critically important lesson of knowing "when to hold 'em and when to
fold 'em). Particularly at low levels, you can outrun a <lot> of the
mobs you fight WITHOUT SOW if you are running at full health. By the
time it's beaten you down to less than a red bubble, you may as well
stand there and get a /loc and go down fighting, 'cause you ain't
outrunning your grandmother on her walker after a bottle of ripple at
that point.

My newly reborn wizard had to run for his life twice last night alone.
(Yes, j-boots help, but still....) But he's hasn't died yet since I
started playing him again.
