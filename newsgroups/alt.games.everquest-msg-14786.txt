On the other hand, sticking at a game from day one can have huge advantages.
Look at ultima online rares, when items and swords were patched out or items
became locked down that value of those items skyrocketed. These were true
rare items that only veteran players could dream of having. A status symbol
of sorts. That was THE best feature of Ultima Online.

Maybe those who play AO from the start will have this advantage in the
future of the game, unless they run it like EQ, in which case :(
