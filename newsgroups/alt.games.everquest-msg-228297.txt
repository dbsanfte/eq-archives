That's probably it.  It would have taken 10 casts of Counteract Poison at
the levels that we were at. It was about 2 weeks after LDoN was introduced,
also.  Really nasty at level 30ish.  I think the Shaman just gave up as he
couldn't keep up with the massive healing that was required and it would not
be cured.
