Hmm, I don't know actually, I stripped all that information off the list I'm
currently using, but it was published here and I've not seen anyone hint that
they disagree with any of it.  Here are the relevant sections:

LoY
Zone   Zem    Bonus   %
Crypt of Nadox  0.85   10%
Dulaks Harbor  0.85  10%
Gulf of Gunthak  0.85  10%
Hates Fury
Torgiran Mines  0.85  10%

The same source listed all the POP zones at 1.19  44%, Paladul Caverns at 1.60
85%.  The printout I have is dated 7/7, so the original posting must have been
made on or slightly before that date if you want to try a web search for it with
what little information I have for you, hopefully though the original poster
will recognize the format and chime in with his source info.

Oh and if he does, I don't see the Hole on there anywhere, would love to know
that that one is at these days.  LOIO was listed at 0.60, a negative 10%, if
thats accurate no wonder the place is deserted these days!
