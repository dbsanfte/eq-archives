    My rogue has a Crown of the Froglok Kings standard. Better AC than the
RS, having the resists constantly is useful, and if you know anything about
dwarf female helm graphics you know that the "no helm" look is a plus.

    Also look into fighting in Velketor's Lab. The Crystal Chitin armour is
as good as or better than Myrlokar's (AC 18 STR 5 STA 5 HP 10 arms, AC 20
STR 7 DEX 3 boots, AC 15 STR 7 DEX 7 HP 40 bracer, AC 20 STR 10 gloves), and
the Spider Fur stuff is awesome for the non-visible slots (AC 10 STR 7 Sv
Cold 7 Sv. Poison 7 collar, AC 10 AGI 5 DEX 5 HP 40 belt, AC 10 STR 4 STA 4
Sv Cold 6 cloak). There's also a pair of solid weapons available (10/22
piercer 3 STR 10 Sv. Poison, 11/24 1HS with 10 AC), and gems for your
velious quest armour. Oh, and AC 5 3 to all saves haste gauntlets.

    Get haste. With it you drop stuff SO fast. If you're planning on having
RB fairly soon put it off, but otherwise do it.

>but I doubt I would be able to evade argo if I
>hit any faster. So, in short, you are fine for armor.

    You know the drill: stand at max distance, evade every time it
refreshes, minimize extra-curricular activities (ahem). With haste I find I
only end up tanking *a lot* if I'm pulling and/or if the party has no tank
with a taunt button. And you have Jackugg. There's even a hidden plus: if I
Disarm, Pick Pockets, and then Backstab I can break a mez and keep the mob
on me with haste. That was fun that one night. 8)

    I'd actually advise against having weapons with procs. A proc generates
disproportionate aggro when compared with the damage it does, and you're all
about aggro control. I sadly have a pair of weapons that proc Velium Shards
(Crystalline Spider Fang and a Velium Short Blade), and it seems whenever we
pull something that will kill me if it turns around they go berserk with
procs. I was grouped in King in Sol B recently in a group with me and a
junior rogue, monk, enchanter, druid, cleric. I was pulling, and the
enchanter gave me Swift Like the Wind and Boon of the Garou (plus 100 DEX,
Werewolf illusion, 28 point lifetap proc). Between me pulling, hitting at an
almost incomprehensible rate, and proccing two weapons and a lifetap proc,
nothing would leave me. I eventually gave up and practiced Disarm up a bit,
too. 8)

5-8

    Very nice weapon. I can see why you have some aggro issues - fast
weapons can cause trouble, just like haste does. Especially if you have
another fast weapon like the BR offhand.

>Summary..
>With the 10dmg 20 delay trak tooth, I have been getting up to 160-200 dmg
>backstabs from level 37 to 50

     My STR with gear is 139, base ATK is 911. With a level-appropriate
druid or SHM STR buff, I find I hit a modal backstab of 118 and presently
have a high of 224. That's also with a ten damage weapon, like you.

    Average? Is that parsed? A "great damage" round of attacks would see me
hitting for 38, 38, 26, 26, two 12 point procs, and a 140-ish backstab. The
swings come at roughly two second intervals with my haste (same as you), and
the backstab is at maybe a seven second interval (unlike your unhasted nine
seconds). That gets me to 96 DPS, assuming NO misses, constant procs, and an
above-modal backstab. I'm level 48, maxed BS and all offensive skills -
again, have you parsed that number?

    Don't. Every time it ungreys, Evade again. You always want to be as low
on the aggro totem pole as possible.

>"freaking whirlwind of steel"

    Wasn't it "feaking whirlwind of steel"? 8) And yes, when fully hasted
that's exactly what you feel like.
