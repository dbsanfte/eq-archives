SOE probably did not think of the ramifications of using DX8.1 all the way
through to "I wonder what percent of players are still on Win95".  My guess,
based on statistics that I am digging up from the back of my faulty memory,
would be that it is between 5 and 10% (in the US, that's the approx number
of Win users still on Win95).  Actually it would probably be less as most
gamers would likely have upgraded to at least Win98.

They made a reasonable offer, based on corporate standards in many
industries, to those that were affected, to refund for recently purchased
copies and to refund for unused subscriptions.  Does anyone really believe
that the affected gamers have suffered financial damages as a result of
this?  Do they think anyone is "entitled" to get paid because of all the
uber loot that they can't play with?  Please.
