Root DoT'ing or Rotting is more MANA effecient because you can med
while the DoTs kill the mob. That is the advantage over pure nuking.

As you have observed there is little difference between nuking and
rotting at level 29. It really depends on what you are fighting and
how you prefer to fight. If you want to nuke, then be prepared to sit
and med between fights. If you Root/DoT, then the mob will last longer
as you med durring the fight.

As you gain new spell circles and Mobs gain a LOT more hit points you
will find that Rotting is usually more mana efficient.

Druids are extremely versatile. That is one of the charms of the
class.
