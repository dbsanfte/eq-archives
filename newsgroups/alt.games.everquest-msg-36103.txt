I was talking to a Rogue, like me, a few nights ago, and he told me he
created combo hotkeys. He said he could pickpocket, backstab, and auto
attack with one button. I was getting ready to ask how he did it, but he
went LD.

Does any one know how I could do this, and what would be some other good
combos for a 17 Rogue?
