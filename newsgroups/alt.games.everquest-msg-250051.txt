Speaking from the point of view from someone in a Plane of Time guild,
I am happy to see that they are fixing this. Do I think it should be
the #1 priority for all things in the game? No.

I can say that unless you have been there, you can't understand the
frustrations that there are with going through all the raids and time
spent to get to Plane of Time, and then having to deal with bug after
bug there, all the while having to be wary of how much time you are in
there for so you don't ruin another guild's instance. Sometimes when
there, I wonder if we're fighting the mobs, or Sony's bugs more. To
watch the raid wipe because your tank on Tallon Zek falls under the
world for 20k damage, and then aggro cannot be gotten by anyone else,
is just more frustrating than I can explain.

Yes, the raiding content needs to be fixed, but like everyone has
stated, that is just a small portion of the EQ population. There are a
ton of other things that could be, and should be done. If there was a
conceivable way to do a little of each whenever they did updates, that
would be ideal.

If those really are the top ten things they plan on looking into, they
really have lost touch with the general population of the game and
they should start saying their goodbyes now to many, many people.
