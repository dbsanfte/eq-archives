Well, he's full of shit then.

The Ball of Everliving Golem is semi-rare at the very least, probably closer
to rare drop.   We raid Fear twice a month, and extra anytime Golems are up
and we are able to negotiate a shot at them with whoever's day it is.  If you
don't count the last fear raid we did, our rate of dropping was 2 golem balls
in 30+  golem kills.  Counting our last Fear raid, 4 golem balls in 33+ kills.
(Not sure if that means we were super lucky on the last trip, or if we were
unlucky on all the times before.  Or both.)
