If there are 3 items and 5 people, lets see.

Your way, everyone rolls once, high roller gets one, next highest
gets one, third highest gets one.

Their way, roll three times, highest of 5 gets on, highest of
remaining 4 gets one, highest of remaining 3 gets one.  

Hmm, thats really the same, your way the four who didn't roll
highest then have one with the highest of four, and same for the
remaining three.

Now what else is different?  Well your way has everyone rolling
for everything.  But in reality, many people skip rolling for one
item or another.  So with all three items, everyone who wants
-any- of them will roll, hoping to get their pick.  Then if they
come in second or third, they may be less likely to pass.  So if
you are a dedicated bazaar trader, there's a slightly lower
chance that people will pass, leaving you with slightly worse
odds of getting an item you are only going to sell anyway.  If
you -aren't- going to sell it, heck, same thing.

Point is, greedy people hoping to take advantage of the fact that
some people will pass on items they don't want and don't want to
bother with selling will do better with the "many rolls" system.

Divvying up loot fast and smooth means more adventuring time, I'm
all for any method that does this.  Particularly with a good LDoN
group, which can easily turn around and go again if they clean up
fast, but with long split times might end up losing some less
patient people or people with less free time available

I've done it both ways, and by NBG and I've seen everyone leave
before the split sticking the ML with the whole bag (often an ML
who's clearly much less well equipped than the rest of the
group)... and of course I've seen dishonest MLs leave without
splitting, too.  And one particularly honest guy who went LD and
then managed to track me down two days later with my share of the
loot!
