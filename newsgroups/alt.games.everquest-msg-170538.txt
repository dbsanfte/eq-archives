}Actually, my most recent trip to Chardok we group wolfformed and all
}auto-followed the Druid.  The run was from DL zone tho, not SF.  Other
}times people have always met up outside the fort.

People who autofollow annoy me, too, but for a slightly different reason.  
It's usually when we're on our way to a raid or something, and I port a 
batch of people there, invis people. sow people, camp the porter, and head 
off toward the raid.  And then people start autofollowing me!  Sheesh! 
What, they think I know where I'm going, or something?

The other variant is when I have to go back for a second load of 
passengers (Illenia is my porter):

You begin to cast Circle of Nexus
Loading, Please Wait...
Guildmate_001 tells the group,"Autofollowing Illenia"
Guildmate_001 tells the group,"Autofollowing Illenia"
Guildmate_001 tells the group,"Autofollowing Illenia"
You have entered the Nexus!

Sheesh people, just because I ported ya doesn't mean I'm gonna hold your 
hand the whole way there!

The other thing is on the way to ToV.  I'm usually trying to pilot 2 or 3 
characters across CS at the same time as I re-do everyone's SoE and invis, 
So I do my guys first, and send them out on autorun over the water, then 
finish the group, and gate to right by the SG zone so I can switch back to 
the other characters and get everyone there in decent time, and start 
swapping the SoE's for SoW's.  And there's always someone who puts 
autofollow on me when I'm in the middle of gating. Somehow I think I'd be 
less annoyed if people didn't -tell- me I was in the middle of ditching 
them, and just kept it to themselves.  (And no, this isn't people who 
don't know the zone or I'd have sympathy and stuff and go back for them.)
