Que?

What you talk about Willis?

Actually I think increasing costs don't really affect the monthly 
fee BECAUSE of the per player thing. Let me explain:

If you have 400,000 month to month subscribers with only 71,000
players on at once time during PEAK USAGE (about the highest number I
ever saw when they still showed the numbers) you only have to have a
set up to accomidate 71,000 people while you get that consistant $9.89
x 400,000 people per month.

What that means is that as the amount of subscriptions INCREASE your
operating costs VS the amount of customers actually start to DECREASE
beyond a certain point. For example, even if you add 200,000 MORE
subscribers month to month, using the same multply by 5.63 percentage
of the above at peak usage you'd only have 106,571 players when most
of the lowest use blue servers are incredibly undercrowded (I've never
even felt like the tribunal server usually ranked in the middle of the
list is overcrowded) You just added $1,978,000 or some more dollars
per month while only having 30,000 more people online AT PEAK
(perhaps, likely even less)

Of course we don't know if EQ is still growing in population because
Verant now hides those numbers (I think justifying rate costs could be
seen as a reason even more than to not give the competition that info)
Perhaps the problem is that its not while costs have increased a lot.

Is that what the paragraph I don't really understand at the start
means? To me its a bit like if you've ever played the Sims. If you
only have a couple in your house money is tight and your house is
small and you are on a budget. If you move in SIX couples then you
have this giant huge but house with only 6 bedrooms and lots of
recreation room with pool tables, the train set, a couple few
computers, several expresso machines, a big giant pool outside etc.
