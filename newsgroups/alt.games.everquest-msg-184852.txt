   I've thought about this sort of thing, from time to time.  I'm
not very attractive, and I don't get out much, but I do like
being married.  So if Lenny happens to die, what would I do?  I
would have to fight the temptation to place a personal ad in the
newsgroup and various eq ezboards.

"Recently widowed eq-playing real woman seeks husband.  Fat, but
knows how to cook.  Owns own house.  Has 4 cats.  Prefers to play
priest classes. Non smoking.  Willing to relocate to other parts
of the country or servers."  I'd bet I'd get at least a couple of
nibbles.

   Almost certainly there was more to it than just that.  A
general lack of shared interests, beyond the tasks of raising the
kids and keeping the bills paid.  Drifting apart can come easy,
and its not always obvious when it starts.  It's easy to have
that happen, and it is a deadly thing in a marriage.  Keeping
similar interested doesn't just happen, IMHO.  

So... yeah, in this case I would have to say that EQ was a
symptom, not the actual problem.
