Yes, and that's something that bothers me about what's being said
about EQ2.  (Not that I expect to play it, frankly; I'm still having
plenty of fun with EQL and don't have time for a second game.  But I
enjoy thinking about these design issues.  Heck, one reason I got
into EQ at all was because I was considering designing an MMORPG!)

Anyway, I certainly approve of rules that prevent KS'ing.  And I don't
even particularly object to rules that prevent PL'ing.  (And Foxeye's
done a good job of meeting all the arguments that PL'ing will still be
possible.  I'm not entirely convinced, because I know players are good
at finding loopholes, but it certainly sounds like it might be well
plugged.)  But I do worry that, in achieving these worthy goals, the
rules will also prevent people from simply helping each other.

Some poor lowbie is dying to a mob.  I notice and heal him or whack
the mob or mez it or whatever, saving his ass.  Happens all the time
in EQL, and the lowbie is usually grateful for it, even if it means
losing the xp.  In EQ2, the lowbie has to know to call for help in
order to unlock the encounter?  What if he's too busy trying to run
away or cast spells or whatever, and forgets to call for help?  Sure,
they might be able to fix that too: e.g., have PCs automatically call
for help and unlock an encounter when they drop to 10% hp (and let
each player change that setting if they want).  But it's still messy.

Another example that I mentioned recently in a different thread: I was
killing gnolls in Blackburrow for faction (don't know if EQ2 will have
factions, but whatever), and a more level-appropriate player showed up.
I could've just left, or I could've said screw him and continued
killing all the gnolls myself.  But instead I helped him kill them,
by pulling for him, healing him (with bandages!), throwing small
amounts of damage (Throw Stone disc for 1 hp), etc.  He made a level,
I got the faction hits I wanted, win-win.  Sure, it was a form of
PL'ing, but nothing egregious; it's more a case of someone getting a
helping hand from a relatively powerful stranger.  To me that's one
of the most pleasant forms of interaction in the game, whether I'm
the one giving or the one receiving the helping hand.  I hope EQ2
doesn't make such interactions impossible.
