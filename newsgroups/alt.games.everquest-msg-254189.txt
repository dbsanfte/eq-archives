Umm, if they're taxing you on what you *spend*, aren't you being taxed as
though you had spent 20K, regardless of how much you make?  Spend 20K, earn
40K, get taxed on spending 20K.  Spend 20K, earn 100K, get taxed on spending
20K.

Remember, it isn't an "income tax".  It's an "outgo tax".

The US already does this to foreign visitors in certain cases.  I as a
Canadian go to Lost Wages, I win big on the craps table, I have to pay 30%
income tax before I leave the casino, and guess what, I don't work or live
in the Excited States.

Apparently there is a way to get some / all of that money back, or so I've
been told.  It's referred to as a clawback form.

That's why winning the lottery in Canada is *much* better than winning it in
the US.  In Canada it's considered "windfall profits" which are tax-free.  I
win $ 10 million in Lotto 6/49, I get a cheque for $ 10 million.  I *do* get
taxed on any interest earned by the money.

As there are no longer taxes being deducted from your paycheque, there's no
real way they can give you a tax deduction on your perscription(s).
However, what might be useful is a different taxation rate for perscription
drugs.  Dunno for sure.  I haven't looked at the info on the site.
