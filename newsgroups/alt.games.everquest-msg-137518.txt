I'm not saying the MT wasn't wrong. I know enough to let the enchanter 
handle the adds. I did my job and /assisted the MT when he switched. 
What I don't condone is prima donna enchanters who incessantly whine 
when a tank switches. And whine when they die. And threaten to leave if 
it happens again. Believe me, if I'm GL when that happens I have no 
problem in booting said enchanter. I'd rather slow up pulls to singles 
than listen to that kind of horseshit.
