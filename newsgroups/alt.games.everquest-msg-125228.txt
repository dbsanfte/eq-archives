The Arrogant Worms, their second disc "Russell's Shorts".

Rippy the Gator goes chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator goes chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time, ending children's lives,
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!

Also:

I've heard the screams of the vegetables
Watching their skins being peeled.
Grated and steamed with no mercy
How do you think that feels?
Carrot juice constitutes murder.
Greenhouses prisons for slaves.
It's time to stop all this gardening
Let's call a spade a spade.

Oh, Georg, where are you that you (and presumably Jazz) have heard (of) The
Arrogant Worms?  I heard "Carrot Juice is Murder" on CKUA, called them, then
ordered the disc.
