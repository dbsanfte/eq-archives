This explains the vunerability, and points to a different, clearer tool 
to tell you that you may or may not have a problem.

As to what to do if you are vunerable?  Try to get a patch from the 
software vendor. You can try replacing the vunerable DLL files with 
fixed versions, but that can break applications dependant on specific 
DLL versions. If you handle Office and  Windows, you handle about 90% of 
the likely exploits. (In order to exploit the vunerability, it would 
have to open the jpg in the vunerable application.)
