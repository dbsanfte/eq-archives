It's strange, I would have thought players would have prefered hacking each
other to pieces, after all why do so many people play Unreal Tournament and
Quake III Arena.  I suppose it's just me always thinking the worst of
people.

And I thought TLC stood for tender loving care :o)

I assume from what you've said this type of server is quite rare.  Sounds
complicated, priase be that the powers that be have all but scrapped the
idea.  The fact that there's no common language could make things difficult,
at least in the real world you can gesture to help make yourself understood.
How can you make yourself understood in a game.  Now that's deep.
