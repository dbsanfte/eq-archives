Well, depends on what you think the cap actually is.  Some say 252, some 
say 254.  Best to just get to 242+5% and be sure.  It's trivial to get 
two more points in brewing anyway.

As far as which is best, depends on whether you are looking for easiest 
or cheapest.  JC is easiest, two item combines of all merchant sold 
ingredients, available from the same, or adjacent merchants, no moving to 
a fixed container required, lots of places you can do it, until you need  
velium, then you move the Thurgadin.

Brewing is certainly far cheaper, but, that 9 item combine sucks big 
time.
