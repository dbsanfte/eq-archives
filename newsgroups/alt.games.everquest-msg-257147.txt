See, when I picture a ranger I picture a supertough outdoorsman (or
woman). And when other people picture a ranger they picture a "scout".
Both Scout and Outdoorsman are more like the classical Ranger than
Archer is.

It's D&D's fault. And they are responsible for the following as well,
indirectly...

I do.

He's a main Mary Sue character from the Forgotten Realms.

He is. And he is the primary factor in why D&D made their rangers have
dual wield. EQ is based in large part on D&D. It all trickled down.
