Well, from my point of view here, the argument is over when pulling 
should start, not the pull rate itself.  He is not advocating playing the 
exact same way as you, he is advocating using the same pull rate, but, 
starting with the cleric at 80 mana, not 20 mana.  This does mean mana 
will vary from pull to pull up and down around the start point.  If, it 
does not, then either pulls need to happen faster, or slower in order to 
be able to maintain a more or less constant rate of expending mana vs 
regaining mana.

You, Fanned, seem to be saying that you can pull at a faster rate, with, 
ultimately, the cleric maintaining an equilibrium of mana expended vs 
mana regained.  Not between each pull, but overall.  Others are arguing 
that given that the cleric has to maintain something close to equilibrium 
on mana used vs mana regained, the pull rate has to be the same.  The 
only difference is what the starting point is, 20% vs 80% for example.  
If both groups start at 100%, and you pull at a fast rate until the 
cleric is at around 20%, then slow down in order to maintain an 
equilibrium, then at that point you will now be pulling at the same rate 
as the group that decides they will keep the cleric at about 80%.

Whether that is actually true or not, is a different issue.  People tend 
to adapt to the situation, and change play style based on a variety of 
factors.

From my perspective, I know that in some groups, I end up tossing rains 
or nukes at mobs because I find that I have more mana than is needed for 
the pull rate.  In other groups, I struggle to maintain my mana, 
constantly canning and torporing.  Personally, I prefer the latter, at 
least for a couple of hours or so.  It does get tiring to continue at an 
intense pace indefinitely.
