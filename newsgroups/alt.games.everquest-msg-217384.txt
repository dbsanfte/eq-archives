If you post your server, there may be someone on the group who can help.

SFG should count as a newbie zone, and maps should be available in it
whether you have Legacy of Ykesha or not - hit backspace and see if a 
map of the zone comes up - that will help you get back out.

If everything else fails find a helpful necro and have him summon your
corpse out.  You'll need to pay for the reagent (a coffin, which one
depends on which summon corpse spell the necro has to use).
