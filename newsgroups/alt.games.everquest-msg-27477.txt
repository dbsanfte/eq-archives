<snip post about medding during combat>


Maybe that was the guy's first toon and he wasn'y fully aware about a casters
proper role in a group.
I was like this with my necromancer when i first started to group, but quickly
learned not to exhaust my mana by DDing mobs the tanks were taking care of. My
strategy now is to cast a darkness, send in the pet, then a DoT, then 1 or 2
DD's but i never sit down to med. I have dark pact (im not sure if shamans have
an equivalent HP for mana spell?) constantly on so i find i dont need to med
mid combat providing i manage my mana well enough. I like to keep an eye on
whats happening, In case a red add pops up or things just start to go pear
shaped so i can start unloading fears and so on. I know alot of casters med
while the fight is on but i dont find i need to, and i have to keep
re-directing my pet to the different mobs.
Perhaps rather than just ignoring the guy you could have explained your group
strategy and he might have been "oh sorry i didnt realise".
