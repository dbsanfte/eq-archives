That's true, but it's also largely irrelevant.  Let's say UberMob56
initially required a raid of 60 with 10 clerics without mod rods.
Now UberMob56 is being routinely dropped by a raid of 30 with 6
clerics with mod rods.  The change goes in and they change mod
rods.  If you're in that guild that was killing UberMob56 before
but all you can bring to the raid is those 30 people, you can no
longer kill UberMob56.  It doesn't matter if the initial kill took
60 people and you could bring 40 and do it *if you only have 30
people in the guild who can show up.*

Mod rods were, effectively, other people, especially healers.
They gave the few healers who attended larger mana pools.  Now
you either don't kill the mob or you bring other healers.  And
you won't find a whole lot of un-guilded high-level clerics
running around, especially when you have to consider that *every*
guild now needs more healers except the very top-end guilds.

Some Luclin encounters were tuned for the mod rod tactics, true.
You simply can't bring enough people to kill them because of the
lag barrier.  (If it took 60 and 12 clerics, you can't add in
another 18 clerics without inducing enough lag to make the fight
unwinnable anyway, for example numbers.)  They'll have to be
re-tuned or those mobs simply won't die.  But it's *every*
high-end encounter where a guild *needed* mod rods to win because
that extra mana replaced people they don't have.  And not every
encounter is going to be retuned since every encounter wasn't
initially tuned around that tactic.

"Mudflation" allows lower-level guilds to kill mobs with fewer
people than the initial kill took.  Mod rods allowed fewer
people still.  Now, if you're looking at killing UberMob56,
you'd better bring more people.  And, if you don't have them,
you're not going to succeed.  You still won't need the numbers
of people that the initial encounter took, but almost every
guild that's challenging itself to move up the 'tier ladder'
is going to have to recruit more healers, "train" them, and
re-think tactics.  And there's just not that many healers out
there looking for guilds, IMO.

So I'd expect a lot of guilds to drop a tier AND a lot of
guilds to disband because of it.
