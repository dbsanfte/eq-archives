Oh cool,  I've been flamed by bizbee. I almost feel like a regular now.

So let me reply in the fashion of the bizster himself. The rest of you
should just move on to the next post, unless you'd like to see biz get some
of his own back.


Look you fucking moron, did you even bother to read the original post? If
you had you would have noticed I wasn't the one who originally invoked
fascism. But I guess you're so full of yourself and get off on flaming
everyone so much that you can't be bothered with context.  But to the point:
fascism is equated with totalitarianism and draconianism whether Webster
says so or not. Since you can't even spell fascism correctly I doubt you
looked it up anyway.
Also twisting my statement to say I am against all games is just priceless.
Really, if you can't stick to refuting what I said you should just shut the
fuck up.
Then you say nobody is imposing values on me, only rules, just before you
tell me what I can't name my character according to your values. Perhaps you
should look up the definition of irony and get back to us.

I'm afraid I have broken a rule here. The rule against arguing with a fool.
I shall refrain from continuing so you can save what little dignity you have
and feel that you've "won" by having the last word. That seems to be your
point in life. So sad.
