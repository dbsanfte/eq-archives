Then again, from the stories I've heard getting your spouse hooked on
this too might be something you will regret for a very long time.
There is something to remember about EQ, if you can handle it and if
it doesn't hook you chances are that a person you can hit with a rock
near you won't be the same way at all and become a full fledged super
freak addict. Personally I would NEVER get an SO into this game, EVER.
Think of it as that hobby you do sometimes and pass it off to your
spouse as what they probably see the rest of your dinking on the
computer as, a waste of time.
