No no no... the issue is not so much a compartive competition (usually) 
about which is guild is better equipped/higher level/or first. Its about 
ensuring the best situation for ones own guild.

In its simplest form...guilds want to get gear for their members. If 10 
guilds are farming a particular zone they will get gear at 1/10th the rate.

So... some guilds will pre-empt other guilds flag raids to keep them out 
of the zone they want to farm. Or failing that they will pre-empt other 
guilds raids *in* the good zone to get the drops for their own members.

It has nothing to do with the other guild per se...

Its rather like pouring sugar in 'everyone elses' car on a Sunday night. 
Its not because you want to get to work 'first' or keep anyone else 
'down' on Monday morning...its just because you want a nice fast 
traffic-free commute for yourself.
