Yes, well, a cat is a bit small to make a good "seeing eye" guide.
Notice they always use larger sized dogs for that role. Size is also
why cats aren't used to pull sleds and herd... Not to mention hunting.
(A cat's not going to be physically capable of "fetching" the duck you
just shot without damaging itself or the "trophy".)

Dogs have better sense of smell, so they're better suited for
"sniffing". Another reason they're not used for hunting, too.

Dogs are simply better suited physically for all the "specialized
jobs" their trained for. I mean, hell, the idea of an "attack trained
police cat" is just silly. Not, I say, because it's not possible to
train a cat to attack, but because it'd be like issuing the officers
pop guns instead of live ammo.

Feel free to look up the studies that have shown brain mass above a
certain point has little relevance to intelligence.

I put weight in having lived with both all my life. Firsthand, direct
comparison has shown me more signs of intelligence in the cats than
the dogs. Their "personalities" are different. Their lack of blind
loyalty doesn't make them any less intelligent (which has been one of
the major arguments in this discussion).
