> Where exactly are these places where you can pull without fear of adds ?

Well one of them is where the south wall meets the sea. There is a big
boulder that is quite safe, there are paths running N-S either side of it,
plus a few wandering kobolds & low-level cats just by the rock/forest
boundary.

There are also several spots about halfway between the town and the dock,
and halfway between the east and west walls. One of them is a small plateau
that very rarely has things walking over it, otherwise just pull back to it.
Snare and Panic Animal are the tools, plus Levitate if you aren't very
careful ;)

My 38 Ranger got to 41 in these two spots without dying - and did the
Wakizashi quest 3 times and the Invader Head quest 5 times (got the sahs
last attempt).

But the key is: Observation! Camo up and watch the paths for a while, the
pathing is very set, doesn't take much observation to find the safe spots.
