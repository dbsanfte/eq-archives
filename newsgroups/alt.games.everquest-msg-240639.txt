You characters are kept for at least three months if you suspend your
account.  They are actually kept much longer, but they only state that they
will keep them for three months.  There is no problem in his argument from
this direction.

Uhm...when you die at a spot in EQ, you *do* magically appear somewhere
else.  It's called your "bind point".

What if your corpse is in a place that takes more than two weeks to get to?
For example, what if your raid wipes in a keyed zone, and the keys aren't
soul bound, and this was before people thought of the dueling/rez tricks to
get into the zone while leaving the keys on corpses outside?  Or what if the
raid was to a place that requires a sufficient force that it takes your
guild a couple weeks to get enough people available, and there aren't any
other guilds going that you can get to do or help with corpse recovery?
