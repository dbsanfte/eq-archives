Outside of the FV server, show me an augment you can get by owning LDoN 
but never going on an LDoN run.  (see my quote above, "get the benefits 
from them")

Just as a side note, it seems on FV that you -can- trade, buy, and sell 
augmented items despite them having a No Drop tag.  I heard this was 
true, but I haven't really tested it... on the other hand I put my +3 
Int augmented Turtleshell Helm up on my vendor last night and came back 
to find it sold.

I *hope* that the augmentation went with it, since I charged and got 
100pp for an item I bought for 50pp... but its been my boon companion 
because my best ratio heal is level 19... and so I didn't replace it 
till I was getting my Seb Key and had to clear a named to get a forager 
to pop and hey, meditative blanket; IH II, which means it works on my 
level 44 heal.  Does IH work on HOT as well?  Anyway, upgrade, so I 
could dump my little turtleshell hat at last, and I thought I'd see if I 
could do so without having to destroy the augment.
