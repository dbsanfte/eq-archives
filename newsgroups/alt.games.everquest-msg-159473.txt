Well, if you spent all your time on the LoIO, OT, DL Kunark express
you're probably going to die a lot, but the Hole is outstanding at level
51. Bring your own group though. Lot's of undead further in.

Sebilis, of course. Again, bring your own group. Undead in spots.

Or, if you just want to stick to outdoor fighting, head to Skyfire. It's
pretty safe near the zone lines and everything will be dark blue or
higher.
