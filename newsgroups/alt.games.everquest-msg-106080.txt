Fun idea. The "get to 60 asap people" always seem strange to me. Why?
What is the point of getting to 60? There is none. You may as well get
the AA points which you are supposed to be getting on the way to 60
and enjoy the ride. The game was never a rush to get 60 and now with
AA points it is far less of a rush. Get the 6 initial ones out of the
way before 55, then start archetype at 55 and be ready to start doing
class at 59. I always thought 60 was retirement and AA points have not
changed that much for me. I'm only 56 because they put AA points in
with Luclin and putting 50 percent in AA I got 56 by trying to get
more AA points.

Stay at 52 as long as you want jumping in on nag vox raids and getting
AA points ;) I totally missed out on the nag vox thing. I was 47 or so
when kunark came out and got to 53 before anyone ever bothered wanting
to do them.
