I have never faced Mata Muram but I believe that the first time you
encounter him as a guild, you can pretty much count on certain death.
Yeah, I know it isn't "certain" however.

In any case, while I agree that before you hit 70, 65, whatever max
level, death mattered; while I also was wary of doing anything that was
almost certain to cause death, once I have reached the highest level I
have never been bothered by death.  Heck I have sacrificed myself on
numerous occaisions in order to just help position a mob or to pull a
named so that my group could kill it once I had snared it and suicided
off the adds.  And back in the Tactics days, I used to eat deaths all
the time.  I knew I was going to die a lot, but the experience made up
for it.  Unrezzed deaths?  Pfff, who cares?  My druid partner and I had
just looted 100k worth of crap from the named and I had 50k worth on my
trader.  Over any long period of time, death was certain.  I still
soloed or duoed Tactics all the time.  Need to see what is up in fear?
Hell I used to just strip off all my gear, run in naked, and circle the
zone for as long as I could, mashing track.  That was certain death as
well.

How do find out if your group can handle an unknown named in a knew
expansion?  You send mikey in to tag him and see how hard he hits,
that's how you find out.  Certain death.  I know I will eat lots of
deaths learning about new mobs in this, just as I have in previous
expansions.
