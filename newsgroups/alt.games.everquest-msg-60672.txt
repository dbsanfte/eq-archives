A while ago I took all of ever quest off my computer.. (cancelling account
first)
... Today I reloaded all the soft ware and found I had to set up account..
new account , as it did not recognize
old name and password..after I typed in the account key found on the
case...and hit enter.
it told me "the key is already in use."  Is there a way to use my software
again?
thank you and I hope every one had a good holiday.
