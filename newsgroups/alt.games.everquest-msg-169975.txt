Well, again, I apparently failed to say what I thought I was saying.

First, it is obviously possible that the main purpose of forming a
particular group is to engage in RP chat together, with the game
forming a preferred backdrop for the story(s) being created/told.
In this case it'd be absurd to complain about "chat styles" in an
out-of-character fashion, tho it's not at all difficult to imagine
an equivalent complaint being made in-character.

Second, while you are, of course, free to do as you please when grouping
with like-minded folks, you <the player, not the character> are being
rude to me if you affect a style of "speech" that makes it difficult or
impossible for me to understand you in a virtual "combat emergency" in
the absence of the aforementioned like-mindedness.  (seven bonus points
if you made sense out of that sentence on the first reading :-p )
Please note, I'm not objecting to roleplaying per se.  I'm objecting to
you rating the style in which you type your messages as more important
than anything else, which is what I would infer from the behavior I'm
criticizing here.  Again, if "role-speech" was the rule of the day, my
only reasonable option would be an in-character tirade against you for
"talkin' like ya got yer mouth full o' ogre dung" or some such.

If that's elitist, guilty as charged.  If not, thanks for the
opportunity to restate my thoughts.  :)

I was mostly just ranting spontaneously against the idea that it was
somehow wrong to be offended by what I saw as elitist gibberish.
I see no meaningful distinction between the more extreme RP "speech"
affectations I've encountered and d00d-speak.  YMMV
