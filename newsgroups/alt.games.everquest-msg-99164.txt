I've found a number of containers in Sharvahl and Shadeweaver.  Most you
gotta be  a cat to get but the one in Shadeweaver you can  get if you are
also any other race.  Go around Sharvahl and hail NPCs, some ask for help
from a citizen, give him slate and they usually give a container(cat only
doable). In shadeweaver, there are bags on the ground in various places,
pick up and see they are 'stinking piles of refuse' collect 4, take to near
the crossroad, there is a wandering NPC that goes up and down path from
crossroad to near the tunnel entrance, hail him and make sure of quest,
there is more than one NPC in that zone that gives containers, one you just
have to talk to, other you have to give refuse to.
