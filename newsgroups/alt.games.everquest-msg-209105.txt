Martin's already given you excellent advice.  Let me just add that having at
least three groups dedicated to crowd control - with healers, tanks, the
whole lot - is essential.  RZtW, by himself, is actually pretty easy; you
only need half your raid to bring him down.  The rest worry about the adds.

We had to adjust our crowd control recently... we *had* been controlling
adds by killing corpses as soon as they spawn.  That no longer does any good
whatsoever, the adds will come whether or not the corpses are killed.  So we
reverted to dedicating more folks to CC.

One other tip: Rallos Zek's corpse outlasts the adds, so after he drops,
don't worry so much about loot.  Concentrate on getting everyone to the PP
in the center of the arena.  You can wait until after the adds despawn to
loot Rallos Zek.
