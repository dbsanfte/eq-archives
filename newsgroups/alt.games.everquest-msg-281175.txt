Not specifically, but in general YES you are wrong.

If I buy a car and put an aftermarket "unsupported" car stereo in and 
everything works fine for 5 months and then suddenly the brakes stop 
working. I expect the manufacturer to fix the brakes, not tell me I have 
an unsupported stereo, and that they can't help me with the brakes as a 
result.

There is no reason to beleive that the VIDEO CARD he is using is 
preventing the PATCHER from DOWNLOADING a file. And any "tech support" 
agent who thinks otherwise needs to be demoted back to "paper weight" 
post-haste.

To the OP, if you feel like calling tech support again, pick a card on 
the list, find out what the latest drivers are and when you call 
support; if they ask: LIE. Those monkey's are reading a script, and if 
they can't figure it out for themselves, "help" them get past that 
script step by giving them the answer they need to proceed.

Faned's response seems a much more sensible one, by the way so look into 
that. Also disable anti-spyware or anti-virus software and anything else 
that might be 'monitoring' the eq files or folders (log 
parsers/macros/etc). Also if its giving you a file name that its having 
trouble with, try manually removing that file (e.g. drag it to your 
desktop) to get the local copy "out of the way".

Good luck.

Also just to drive the point home: you could uninstall the drivers and 
tell windows its a generic "Super VGA" card with no hardware 
acceleration at all. EQ won't run at all, no how, but the patcher will 
still work just fine!
