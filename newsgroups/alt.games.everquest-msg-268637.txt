The only person to date that I see soloing "uber drops" was somebody
soloing Rotroot or whatever the named nasty in the cave that the
Empress asks you to kill in Oakmyst.

Though it was less like soloing for uber loot or more like farming
with your anonymous on so people of the appropriate level for that
zone don't get pissed if they knew your actual level or the
uncomfortable question people will ask you in /ooc along the lines of
"What is there here at your level that you are hunting..."

As for the justification that people whine when you win lotto, to date
from n00b isle to qeynos I have heard nobody in any group I was in
complain about the lotto outcome. So my experience has been the
opposite. There are a lot of fine quests out there for people that
will give them items which are appropriate for their levels, unlike
EQ1, so there isn't that pressure to get that "one" item. Are there
better items dropped, sure, but acquisition is based less on need and
more on greed. It's not going to make or break a character.

If anything it amuses me that people actually sell these quest items
and drops on the market that any player could get for themselves with
a little time and effort and not only will you get the item, but also
some coin and exp. Drops seem quiet frequent versus old EQ. I only buy
crafted items, I never feed the farmers.

The only other question is when the other guy said," I need that
item;" was it an item he could use and you just wanted to try and
sell? Then it is an issue of character (that's the personal kind, the
in in game character), not whining. I inspect all drops rather than
smacking the "loot all" key as fast as I can. Items not suitable,
wrong class, or not an upgrade of what I am using, I pass on and I
share this philosophy with my groups prior to a fight out of the hope
it might rub off on one or two of them. That might be why there is
less whining in my groups.

Just a thought.
