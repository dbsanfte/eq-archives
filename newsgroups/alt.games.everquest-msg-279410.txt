The Ranger won't outdamage you unless he put in 45 AAs.  45 AAs will
take you a long way toward improving your own DPS or mitigation.  Once
the Ranger gets to that point, his potential for increased DPS is much
poorer than yours.  For every piece of plat, AA, or raid time you spend
on either one, you will improve the monk's DPS faster.  I have trouble
believing that a comparably-equiped berzerker or even BL will
out-damage you.  Yes, the rogue will probably stay a step ahead of you
but then they have their own disadvantages.

I believe you still have the 4th best mitigation in the game?  I dont
think the chain classes can out-mitigate you.

Bards are great at chain pulling, indoors or outdoors, where lots of
mobs are stacked on top of each other.  The bard's advantage is mostly
erased if there is very little stacking, I believe?  You do get to
pacify one mob at a time don't you?  You are the best puller in many
situations though.  Mobs that cant be pac'd, raid targets, etc..

You get the best, and one of the only, feigns in the game.

You get some pretty cool discs.

All-in-all I would say that on a budget, the monk would be one of the
best all-round performers, not the worst.
