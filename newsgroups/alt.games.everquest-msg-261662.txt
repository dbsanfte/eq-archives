Of course. I never meant that it would literally expire in 6 months 
whether you played that character at all. I merely meant that if it 
takes a year of play time to upgrade a weapon then the weapon should 
last you that year... it would be pointless to make you camp for 6 
months to get weapons that wore out in 6 days.

An interesting conundrum. Your good gear and your disposable gear. I 
don't care for the idea from an RP perspective... which is why I like 
your thoughts below (and even suggested it myself elsewhere).

/agree
