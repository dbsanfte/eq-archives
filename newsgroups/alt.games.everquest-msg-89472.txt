Speaking of Paineel Faction.... There seems to be two different factions in
Paineel.  I have worked my way up to Amiable with the Heretics, but it seems
the hard core necros or someone seems to be on a different faction... they
are dubious to me.  Any idea what faction they are on and how to improve it?
