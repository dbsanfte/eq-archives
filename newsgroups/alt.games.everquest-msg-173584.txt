Here's a thought: book up to POK, down to FOB (book labled Cabalis) then hunt
the various skellies there (exp giving skellies with lots of bone chip drops
here) and occaisionally back to POK and down to Kaladim for the best bone chip
quest.  Level up a bit and start going to Kurns, without a doubt the best
exp/bone chip zone in the game.

I'd love to have had access to the POK system in my lowbie days, the potential
for this sort of thing is amazing.  For added fun, use the soulbinder in POK
itself, putting you one zone away from any newbie zone on death, or when you get
gate (level 5.. why you have gate now!)
