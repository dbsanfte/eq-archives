Don't know about the lake, but in the Field, they tend to be toward the
middle and farther down (if you come in from the path straight out of town).
They're also out the other side of the pit, wandering around, but be sure
you're attacking a bandit and not one of the higher-level varieties.

Or, if you're on Fennin Ro, I've got a few spare masks in the bank and would
be happy to MQ it with you.
