Recently while sitting around Sro doing nothing - i spied the ancient
cyclops roaming around. I figured someone was nailing it, but went to
go have a peek anyways, and to my suprise, he was all alone and just
cruising. Not wanting him to feel lonely, i entertained him (read:
blasted his ass) and got the AC ring. Being a druid, obviously I have
no need for Jboots so i offered it to my love, since shes always with
me, she didnt need it, and since I dual box, my alts are always with
me and my friends either had Jboots or easy access to SOW, Ive decided
to MQ it.

Now the question is, whats the best way to do this? Im told I can get
4-5k for it. Heres my idea on the best way, correct me if im wrong. Be
upfront with the client and make sure he/she knows the specifics of
the quest. Id assume they already do, but dont want to be hailing
Hasten and have the person turn in 325pp instead of the gold and mess
it up. Also have them have the no rent items in hand already so we can
run to RM and do the deed. After hailing Hasten (to hold the little
bugger steady), they give me the 4-5k (or whatever price weve agreed
on), I give Hasten the ring and tell them its all thiers.

Any input on this? Am I missing something crucial? Anyone have any
stories about MQ'ing this (good or bad)?
