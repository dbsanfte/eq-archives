I am almost certain that this is the case, and that sometimes the multiple 
faction groups are weighted, so he's, say, 60% merchants of qeynos, 20% 
bloodsaber, 20% unseen hands.

At which point, I get a headache and go lie down somewhere for a while...

The only real evidence I can think of offhand is in oggok, with Clurg.  
When I was first doing the stein quest, I believed I needed amiable to be 
sure it would work.  So, I Illusion DE'd and allianced him.  Hmm. Still 
Indifferent.  But, if I also allianced a bouncer, a craknek, and a 
greenblood, he did eventually con amiable.  Presto Stein-o.
