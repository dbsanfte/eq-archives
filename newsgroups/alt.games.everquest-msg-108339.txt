/Sigh 


I find it odd that people have to correct top posts, but hey what ever
floats your boat. I find it more odd that people have to say "top post
corrected". I commented on it. Not quoteing responses is a problem.
Quoteing 50 lines of text and bottom posting "yeah me too" is even
worse.

What I do find distressing is being called an Idiot, a Retard, and
other names just because I say I think nobody really cares. People
disagree, wonderful, find something substative to disagree with. (Oh
wait! I forgot! This is/was USENET, NM, thats SOP) The flame wars
happen because a dozen vocal minorities get mad about it, and a dozen
more retailiate. Most people just find it odd like I do. Other group I
read don't get nutty about topposts.

The best point I saw was usually people only respond to the last
thread. That is true 99% of the time. (I am sure someone is going to
post that it is actually 86% but hey!)

Guys it's not like I am going to a raid somewhere and begging you for
plats. Thankfully, it's out of my system. I won't mention it again.

I learned that lesson. Don't have sex with the sacred cow!
