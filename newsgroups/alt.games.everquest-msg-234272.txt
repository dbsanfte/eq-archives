Am I to understand that, once GoD goes live, *all* AA points are going 
to cost more no matter where you are? Or just when you get xp in GoD 
zones? Because if they are going to crank up the cost of AA's for people 
not even in GoD (or those who don't even have the fucking expansion) 
then that's fucked up.
