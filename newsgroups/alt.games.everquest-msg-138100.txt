So? They're there NOW. I could care less about when they leave.

Practice makes perfect as the old saying goes. Every single one of my 
casters has taken a day out of their life to max ALL of their magic 
skills. Anal? Maybe but then I wouldn't have my buzzard in the bazaar. 
Maybe I'm just a bit more considerate of others that way.

In the meantime anyone with less than a T1 and a Ti4800 gets to suffer 
right? So I have to stare at the floor to make the wizzie standing next 
to me's (AFK by the way) like just a tad easier?? Nah.. kill the bird on 
the zone in. Any every other pet that zones in. Matter of fact I'd like 
to see it a "silent" zone.. NO CASTING AT ALL. Wanna cast? Head to SH 
and spam it all you like.

Yeah while everyone next to you gets to suffer. How considerate of you.
