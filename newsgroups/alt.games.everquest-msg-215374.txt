Cool - replied to Ronny's post,then thought we needed a new thread.

Looks like you beat me to it.  I have the beginnings of a table 
worked out (see my reply for the full post).  I'm going to post it
here

Note - I rounded the avg level down in my groups.
4x65 + 2x58 avg's 62, 5x65 + 1x58 avg's 63,

Also - I'm assuming avg level for the moment.  I'm quite willing
to be proved wrong and change it to total levels.

The reward, HP, and max hit are all personally
confirmed for level 65 and level 60 adventures.

Important Note - the lower level in our adventures
got less points (I'll check my logs, but I think the
58 got 34 when we got 51)

We need -
Full groups -
total levels, avg level (round down), reward per person and their
level, mob hp, mob max hit, aproximations of mob level.

Partial groups
total levels, avg level (round down), reward per person and their
level, mob hp, mob max hit, approximations of mob level.

------------------------------------------
avg level 63+ on hard gets level 70
avg level 63+   gets level 65 51pts -- mobs 58-62, 15khp, 370hitter
avg level 58-62 gets level 60 34pts -- mobs <58,   10khp, 260hitter
avg level 53-57 gets level 55 22pts -- mobs xx-xx,  
avg level 48-52 gets level 50 16pts -- mobs xx-xx,  
avg level 43-47 gets level 45 11pts -- mobs xx-xx,  
avg level 38-42 gets level 40  8pts -- mobs xx-xx,  
avg level 33-37 gets level 35  6pts -- mobs xx-xx,
avg level 28-32 gets level 30  4pts -- mobs xx-xx, 
avg level 23-27 gets level 25  3pts -- mobs xx-xx, 
avg level 20-22 gets level 20  2pts -- mobs xx-xx,
