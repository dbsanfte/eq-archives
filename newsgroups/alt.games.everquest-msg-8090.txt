I don't have any high level characters (my highest is level 13), and
whenever I have lost a level after getting killed, I've only had to
kill like two blue mobs to get my level back.  From what I understand,
a high level player seems to lose a good deal more experience, often
enough for them to seek a high level cleric to rez them.  How much
experience loss does a player suffer at higher levels?

Also, what is the protocol about asking a high level cleric to rez
you?  From what I understand, if they're grouped, clerics generally
don't want to leave their group to rez somebody unless there's a break
in the fighting, so will ask the other player to wait, which is
understandable; also, they don't usually want to have to travel
several zones away to rez somebody and will prefer the other player
drag their corpse to where the cleric is at.  Can one drag their
corpse to another zone? (I've never tried doing this with my corpse).
Also, I've heard people talk about getting coffins, I think from
necros; is that part of the process of getting a rez?  Also, what is
the general going price to pay a cleric for a rez?

Thanks in advance.  

By the way, thanks to everyone who have answered my other questions
I've posted earlier; it's been very helpful to me!
