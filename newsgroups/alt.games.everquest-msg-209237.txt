I imagine that back in the day when a level 30 character was pretty much
uber and HGs were among the toughest mobs available, Rathe was a gauntlet.
Now it's an ATM.

Of course the simple solution would be to do something SOE *claimed* they
did a couple of years ago, which would be to balance the level of reward
with the relative difficulty of the mob. I.E. mobs of a certain level of
difficulty would drop more or less equitable loot rather than having a
single type of mob that drops ten times the plat of anything else its level,
or ten levels above it, for that matter.
