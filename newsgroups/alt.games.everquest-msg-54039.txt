Technically, no. I played my wizard to 25, but that was back when I was
sure I knew everything about eq already, and in fact knew fucking
nothing. Fifty some levels on my warrior later, I've finally reached the
point of realizing that I'll always be a stupid newbie with every new
class, zone, etc. that I go into. It's been enlightening. I played my
wizard horribly in retrospect. The necro is vastly complex, but I'm
enjoying the learning curve immensely.

Yes, but at the early levels I'm forced to tank for my pet a lot, so I
was hoping for a decent xp to minimize healing downtime.

Agreed, but isn't the INT to Mana conversion ratio much more pronounced
later on? I had read that a 200+ INT on a sub-level-ten necro was a
pittance of mana compared to later on, plus, in the later levels I won't
be tanking at all anyway.

Necro ONLY???? How about fucking Necro USABLE!!!??? I can't use SHIT
that's out there!!!!!!!!!
/em stamps his pathetic little human necro feet.

Yes, parts of the equipment section are still no pay. That's where I got
the information that most of the armor my warrior could go collect would
be not usable by my necro. :-(
