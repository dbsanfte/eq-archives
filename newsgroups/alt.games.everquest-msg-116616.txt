That is a brilliant insight, just barely off target and the better for it.

However, while my EQ character is a carTOON or 'toon, my little
red  corvette is a CARtoon, or car'.

I don't like the term because its a semi-medieval fantasy world and

ideas?

Of course its no big deal, but arguements like this can be enjoyable
on their own merits if you don't take them seriously.
