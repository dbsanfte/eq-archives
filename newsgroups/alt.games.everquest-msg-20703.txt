Wow, he admitted that you're not so bad after all, and he's making good
points.  Ok, off my killfile he comes.  Despite his immature handle (anyone
who uses/promotes illegal drug use is immature) perhaps he'll actually
contribute to the ng.

As to this post, ALL we're talking about is following the rules as we agreed
to them.  At work I use the same language as I would in /ooc.  Outside of
work talking to friends I often curse like a sailor.  When I play EQ I
follow the rules.  When I post on Usenet I follow THOSE rules.

I don't know if Lokari curses regularly.  I don't think she's a prude
though, or else Bizbee (and I, on occasion) would be in her KF.

Just follow the rules...there are very few universal rules out there, and
that's a good thing.  If Gets was actually a proponent of following the same
rules as EQ here, the very first thing he'd HAVE to do is change his display
name.
