I'm at the point where I'll buy Sun Vortex when I see it in the bazaar
and roll on no more runes.  Rathe's son is worthless IMO, so I won't
deprive other people of their 65 spells for a shot at it.  This is bad
for my fellow mages in guild, because rune dupes gotten in guild raids
go back to the guild to go to another of that class.

I've always done 2ear, 2bracer, 2ring - but I'm told they don't equip
the second of those slots.  When I want him to tank it's

Plate (except bracers)
Sapphire and Ruby Bracers
Studded and Spiked Rings
Glowing and Brilliant Baubles
Mantle
Choker
2 Weaps
Muzzle
Girdle
Elemental defender (after weaps
to force to back slot).

I'm really hoping for a new set of summoned
armor from GoD with HP and Stats on them, just
for pets like the stuff in PoP.

I have EQWatcher running reading my log file in real time - and it
verbalizes "Enrage" when something enrages.  Sometimes that's my
first indication that it dropped in the pot and my pet needs a heal
NOW.  Fortunately the pet heal is autotargeting and casts faster
than enrage runs out :-P

Looks and Resists.  If I had Kedge blades I'd use them in Lightning,
but not in water.  I use Fists in Ice/Wind because fire lands well.

I've read it somewhere - but it's lost in the haze that is my memory.

Druid - by 20%

It's still nice for the big BOOM :)

The 61 dot focus bracer is the result of a quest - 1 cohesion gem,
1 oxidized steel plate and one summoned sapphire bracer to Nayr 
Cogswain in PoK and he gives you the spell.  The first 2 components
drop in PoI.  This bracer is also in the jewelry bag (6 foci in a
summoned bag in one cast).

Anytime anyone on the tower said "xxxx spell is a rare from turnins" 
someelse would counter with "I got *5* of those on 7 turnins".  Or
words to that effect.  I'm fairly certain (with no proof mind you)
that the RNG is just that streaky.
