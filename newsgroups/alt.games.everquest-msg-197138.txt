Well unless you are paying for aego and focus or some combination of high
end buffs, you are swapping out for your stamina buff and hp buff
(hopefully).  I think regen is the one that you should not feel bad about
swapping out, regen is good to cast on you but look at the mana vs GHeal and
you'll find you are casting it less (mostly before battles if it isn't on,
if it wears off during a battle it isn't going to make that big of a
difference in most situations).  For you SOW is your gate, so no need to try
and swap that out.  Perhaps quickness, you will start melee'ing less and
less as you get higher up so that shouldn't be a problem.
