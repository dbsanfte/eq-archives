10 percent would be 40,000, roughly. I really HIGHLY doubt it.
Annie hits the nail on the head, Brad McQuaid even made this comment
once to issues players raised regarding the message board. Players
were saying "its obvious that we all want this so why don't you change
it?" and McQuaid more or less said, "because this is by no means a
valid sample since an incredibly small percentage of our players in
the game ever bother to come to these boards at all, let alone post."
He went on to say it was that way for every web board or newsgroup in
the EQ community, or any such online game.
I tend to agree.

AHAH exactly. More and more lately in fact I hear even high level
people ask, "Is dubious KOS?" Everyone then jokes that the person is
ebayed, though they are not. Someone asking that really just shows
that they log on.. and move through the game grouping with others and
never really are concerned about quests or EQ lore on the internet
(anyone who was at all would know that dubious was not kos) Such a
person is really playing EQ in the exact same way that I played pong,
I never looked up info on the web about the pong community (mostly
because the web was not even around then.. but still) nor did I really
care who made pong or what the paddles were made of or why they hit
some thing when I moved them. Hmm.. I think I will start calling
people who are high level but have no real knowledge of the game
"Pongers."
