And there's not a darned thing we can do as players to affect the
outcome.
Which is really my only real problem with these events; they ARE
scripted, and as such really not all that dynamic.  Dynamic would mean
that on some servers, the forces of Lanys WERE fought back, others they
were not, and perhaps on others still, both sides were destroyed, or
any number of other outcomes.

No, it's still static, as static as any prescripted play; perhaps more
dynamic than say a DVD, but about as much leeway in changing the
predetermined outcome as Rosencratz and Gildenstern have of not
swinging on the gallows at the end of Hamlet.  The end result is set,
unchangable, and while the details of the play may change as an actor
flubs his lines, the end results are always the same.

The only area the dynamics exist in is the story writers.  But that
story is static from the readers point of view, even if the books are
still being written. The protion the reader sees has still been
pre-written, and is still static. Even if one were the first person in
the world to get a copy of a brand new book in some series, that story
is NOT dynamic; it doesn't change with subsequent readings
(Choose-Your-Own Adventures are still static: read it from cover to
cover, and the text still doesn't change). And that is exactly what
we're getting: installments of a story that is in the process of being
written.  Dynamic for them, perhaps, not for us.  We're just spectators
who are allowed to stand on-stage and push the actors around a little.

Don't get me wrong, I like how they have these mass events that do
change the environment.  But calling it dynamic?  That is just not
true, at least not from the players perspective.

When I, as a player, can permanently change an aspect of the game, or
can contribute to changing the scripted outcome of such events, THAT is
when I'll call it dynamic.
