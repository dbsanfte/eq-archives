Prexus was pretty good in that respect.  The top 4 guilds are all pretty
reputable (well cept mine, we broke the rotations omfg), and being the
second guild into all the tier 2/3 stuff, we had a lot of zones to
ourselves.

6 months later, and well as you'd expect, a lot of morons are into PoS/PoV -
but theres still sanctuary in HoH, CoD, and my favourite of all, PoE (kinda
sucks that my rogue is missing a few flags so has no elemental access - he's
been put on the backburner for a couple of months now)
