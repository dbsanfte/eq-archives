Rather than cleric/warrior, I'd have picked cleric/ranger... until
rather high levels, you can happily fear kite your way across
the wilds of Norath.

Exchewing clerics and druids both, thats harder.

Erudite mage/necro
Erudite enchanter/necro
Erudite Paladin/necro..

If you have a necro, you don't need to think of
it as healing for two, after all, and likewise a
good mage doesn't really need a healer either.

The fun thing about the erudites is that there
are two cities, good and evil, which would
allow you some built in conflicts while
remaining of the same race.  From a more
practical note, this combo would let one
or the other of you in to shop almost anywhere.

Gnome necro/chanter
Gnome necro/warrior
Gnome necro/mage

Dwarf Paladin/Paladin
One paladin can't heal for two?  How
about two paladins?

A bard is not a healer.  Yes, he can cut
your downtime a bit, but really, if you
ever need a heal, nothing he can do will
save you.  Might just as well rely on
a monk's bandaging capablities.

Speaking of monks

Human monk/monk.

Iksar monk/monk

I think if I were you though, I'd hold off
a few months and go with Kerran Beastlord/Shaman.
