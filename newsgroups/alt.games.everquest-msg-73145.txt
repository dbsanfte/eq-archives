>Yeah. Right.

Actually this is basically true. Especially with a Melee class. 

As an experiment I used my 50 Druid to lightly PL (skin, regen, low
level damage shield)  another Druid on my second account. In 4 hours
the new druid was level 16. All combat skills were maxed (Off, Def,
1HS, 1HB, Dodge)  I then grouped the new Druid with my Level 33 Bard
(clarity song) and chain casted level 1-5 spells to get all casting
skills up. This took less than 2 hours.

So in 6 hours played I had a level 16 Druid with all main skills
maxed. I got bored at this point and quit, but it would have been
trivial to continue. I wasn't even trying very hard. I am sure that
with 2-3 high levels working together you could level a new twink
incredibly fast, and still keep all of the main skills maxed.

Cheers
