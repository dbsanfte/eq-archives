I've been to the Feerot ring numerous times, with no difficulty whatsoever.
Not sure what the problem might be.  Just stay away from the very small
number of bouncers.  This is with my Shaman, OK, SoW helps, but strafe
running should keep you one step ahead of the bouncers if that becomes an
issue.  Is NK ring really significantly farther than Feerot?  I've always
had SoW making the run, so I'm not certain on that.  SK is kind of big.
