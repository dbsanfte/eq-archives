 Yes you can. We are pro-giant and regularly kill those mobs. Go on a
Dain killing and you're back to ally in Kael again. Killing named in
Thurgadin conveniently balances out killing named in Kael. True, if you
throw Skyshrine into the mix you may have a problem. But being pro-giant
we don't care about Skyshrine or Thurgadin.

 However the ring quest does not. You can go all the way through the
10th ring even if KoS to Coldain. Sneak will work.
