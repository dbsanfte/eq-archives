Vlad, you know very little of me if you think I'm trolling. It was a
legitimate question, which some people here have posted answers to that
actually more or less *answered* it. I never said the damn thread was
english only (and please learn how to spell or type), I only asked why
people who spoke a non English language posted to a *primarily* English
speaking NG.

Flame elsewhere if you feel the need, I have *20 to fire.
