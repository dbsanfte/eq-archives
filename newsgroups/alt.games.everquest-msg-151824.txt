I forgot about that. It is an issue with the firmware on the router. I
got mine a couple years ago (before the problem). Newer models than
mine ship with an updated non-EQ friendly firmware flash. To fix the
problem users had to download an older version and flash thier
routers. Took all of 5 minutes to fix. Since then I am pretty sure the
newest flash revisions are ok with EQ.
