Yep. Some time back we were camping Jail in Seb with Orlun the rogue. He
went LD during a fight and the mob ran outside the safe room. Killed
that one but got an add which aggro'd Orlun. It was getting pushed
further and further towards the cliff, so we attempted to back up so it
would come back to center. Orlun [LD], however, wasn't much up on
strategy and kept on pushing it until it went over the ledge down to the
waters below.

The train that came back wiped us all out except the two that managed to
camp in time.

Ahhhhhhhh... good times. :-)
