    Actually, there hasn't been a "just cause" death mob in ages. Last one I
can think of was in Luclin.

    No, and amazingly the mobs we fight are very different.

    There should be no boss fight where people are useless. I'm not even
talking "of lesser value", like if the melee DPS was forced to use bows and
throwing weapons to deal damage in a ranged fight. I mean they do nothing,
nada, zip, go away, you aren't wanted. People don't feel like the heroes
they're supposed to be playing if they have to sit the fight out because of
how impotent they are.

    Back when people attacked in waves to avoid crippling lag, and not for
any other strategic reason? EQ has improved, the lag is gone! Come play
modern EQ, it's a lot more fun than Nagafen raids!

    Then let me be specific: it cannot be done. Healers must be stationary
to heal. If a mob cannot kill someone in under one second, it is trivial to
us. There aren't any repeatable sub-second heals in game. Can't be done.

    You always have to execute. Knowing the plan and being able to execute
it are two very different things.

    I say "arguably" because someone may value another effect more than they
value a right-clickable 8 point mana regen self-buff that stacks with all
other forms of mana regen. It does have the best mana regen buff in game,
tied with the shoulders from Quarm, and mana regen is huge for casters, so
it would be on pretty much anyone's top five list, but I cannot say with
certainty that it is "best" to everyone. It's hard to say that about
anything these days because of the large variety of foci and effects
available.

    If only that were true. ;-) Hey, tell you what - once all three top
guilds on my server have beaten the first mob in Tacvi, I'll post every last
detail of the encounter. You can then tell me how to beat it! Deal?

    At the present time, a player in my guild needs to raid for roughly two
weeks before they get a drop. Two weeks of logging on most nights, playing
for most of the night, to get one improvement to their character.

    You want a system that would slow that down even more.

    At the present time, SOE can barely scrape together enough content to
fill a mini-expansion like GoD. They frequently have to place blockades in
the progression path just to get enough time to finish released content.

    You want them to have more content per encounter, and have it properly
playtested and balanced so players can complete it.

    Not going to happen.
