Yes...basically the warrior is not broken, they are not knights / rangers,
they are a different class.

Just because other people dont know how to adapt there aggro when a warrior
is there doesn't mean warriors are broken, just others are lazy.

The main problem that warriors have is not the aggro problem by itself, but
the fact that knights can get almost the same hp AND have the aggro
advantage, this still doesnt mean warriors are inherentley a broken class.
