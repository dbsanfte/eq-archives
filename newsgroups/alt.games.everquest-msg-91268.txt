Another alternative if you can manage invisibility is to swim to the firepot
room in TD (OT boat would probably be easier for this) and port to kelethin
invisible. Getting back is easy, just snag an invis to get on the shuttles
and firepot back to cabilis. Theres usually some druid quadding the dorfs or
someone the crazed goblins who can cast invis. Im not sure that iksar are
kos to the dwarf ladies anyway... my eru necro was indifferent to them.
