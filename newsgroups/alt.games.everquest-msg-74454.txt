You'll get the following self-only ports at 19:

Ring of Karana (NK)
Ring of Commons (WC)
Ring of Butcher (BB)
Ring of Toxx (sp?) (Toxx forest)
Ring of Surefall Glade

I don't remember exactly where you get all these except SG but it's either the
druid ring in WC or NK. You can buy SG at the Ranger guild in Kelethin.

You don't need a component. Just load it up and fire away.
