Check out the quests for your class specific armor and any other quests 
you think you might be interested in, then explore the zones you'll need 
to go to later.  A couple areas I wish I had explored when I was younger 
are Guk and Mistmoore.  I think you can get experience at your level in 
parts of upper guk, and if you have never killed a frogluk you are 
probably not KOS there yet, so you could learn the area before hunting. 
  Mistmoore is a bit higher so your ability to explore there might be 
limited.

You might also want to look around Paineel and jump in the Hole.
