Even with snares you can still end up with messy cleanups...

And now you're into Harriers (and Avos later?) you've got more hp to wade
thru, which means more chances for resists and partials... and you're now
into the areas where not all mobs are the same levels... which means more
uneven damage and messier cleanups.

That 4x 'You gain Experience' is rarer than most would admit, but when
you've gotten the hang of it, you'll wonder why it took so long to try it
:o)
