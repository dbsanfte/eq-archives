You're right, Graeme.

And to the OP - the chance of a mob resisting is based on 4 things - the
level of the mob, the MR of the mob, the level of the enchanter, and the
level of the enchanter's spell.  As a level 40 enchanter, you're likely to
be grouping in LDON with folks generally higher than you, because
enchanters, bards and clerics tend to be highly valued in LDON.  This may
mean you're going from lulling very-blue mobs to barely-blue mobs - say,
going from mobs with a general level of around 30 to mobs with a general
level of around 38.  If your LDON team is a bunch of 45s and 46s, it's even
likely you're lulling yellows and reds.  Because their levels are closer to
yours, you'll get more resists.

What can you do about the resists?  As Graeme says, Intellectual Superiority
to raise your effective level.  Other than that - get the Charisma up to try
to avoid aggro, and if you can spare the spellgem then Calming Visage will
make it easier for your tank to get the adds off of you more quickly.
