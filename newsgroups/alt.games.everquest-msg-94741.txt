What you say is true, but almost definatly not relevant in this case.
He is level 12.
So a light blue is level 8
and a dark blue could be 9,10 or 11

BB is a newbie zone will a 100 ZEM (?)

You only get 1/2 xp for light blues.

So those light blues give him (8*8)*100 / 2 = 3200
The dark blues could give 9 (8100), 10(10000), 11(12100) xp
a level 11 mob would give him almost 4* as much xp

The light blue gives about .8% of level a level 11 dark blue gives over
3%
So those 4 LtBlues are about equivilent to the one dark blue.

Of course the odd ness of the xp bar can excentuate this.

HTH,

Jim
