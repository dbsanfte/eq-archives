Hmm, now I see why I don't see shaman with pets 29-34.

The charm pet spell we get is also a level 14 druid one, and
apparantly has a very low level cap, someone said level 14,
someone else said 24.

This leads me to the musical question, where's a zone with level
14 (or is it 24) animals that also has mobs worth fighting at 30?

Personally, of course, I'll never ever get tired of hunting in EQ
with a snow bunny for my pet.  I think I still have a screen shot
from a couple years back of a snow bunny getting the kill shot on
the RyGorr Oracle, a level 45-50 shaman mob that used to spawn
near the Iceclad Bridge.  That one was bard charmed and then
buffed by my cleric and a druid we had  in the group, but now I
have my own bunny friends, with just 29 shammy buffs they aren't
nearly as fierce of course, but what can you expect?

Charm animals we don't get till 34, by which point I'm thinking
I'll probably use Dog-dog, since when charmed pets with shaman
buffs and no Snare break charm they can be... challenging.  Thats
mainly from watching the difference between an enchanter and a
druid work charm in PONightmares, of course, so your milage may
vary.

Paak, 30 bear, 3 bunny... hey, this wonder of a shaman is very
like an SK!
