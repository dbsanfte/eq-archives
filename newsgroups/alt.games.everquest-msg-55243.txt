The odd thing is...the 'd' rule (the way it can be interpreted) makes it
sound like Italian style names that start with 'di' would be a violation.
diRiggatio or some such name would likely not pass the test according to
some interpretations.

Surnames that start with 'Mc' or 'Mac' or 'Macc' are allowed, though that
means 'son of'..and can imply a title or a three word phrase if translated
into modern English.  However, 'Von' and 'Van' (German and Dutch) can be
unacceptable surname prefixes according to Verant's naming policies (cannot
have a name that means 'from' or 'of').  Common conventional naming
techniques in other foreign languages, such as 'bin' & 'ben' and 'Al-'
prefixes in Middle Eastern languages, are also naming no-no's in some
interpretations of the rules.

I can understand that they have to draw the line somewhere, but the policy
as it is written and enforced seems to draw the lines arbitrarily depending
on the language one gets their name from.  I know that most GMs and Guides
are limited to one, or at best, two languages, but c'mon....Eagleheart is
OK, but Couerd'Aigle isn't?  How else are you going to say 'Eagleheart' in
French?  Gaelic 'of' is ok, but French or German 'of' isn't?

The naming policy appears to punish the more creative and intelligent
people, while winking a blind eye more toward people who go for names like
'Tyranoosar Usrex.'
