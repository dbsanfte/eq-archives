Okay, names crossed. "Bod" started the thread about the AC. The name
"Bodi" wasn't mentioned in the original post in this thread. Perhaps
later on, but not in the original post. Having just read through a
discussion on camping the Ancient Cyclops, "AC" naturally popped into
mind as that. Especially given you throw it out out of the blue whilst
talking about bow kiting.... "Bodi" crossed as "Bod" and "Bod" talking
about the Cyclops...well, easy mistake.
