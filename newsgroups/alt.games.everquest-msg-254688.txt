This druid is an odd duck, a nice enough person, but a PL'd character 
who doesn't seem to have the interest or drive to really learn to play a 
druid well, at least so far.  I've got an enchanter friend at the moment 
who was similarly PL'd, but who's been very interested in making up the 
deficits.  I can't imagine wanting to play a druid but not caring about 
track... what is she being PLed up to use as a port whore?  Thats soooo 
pre SOL (the nexus is what made me stop playing the druid I made as a 
taxi for my friends, POK merely drove the stake thru the heart)

I can solo the tainted, trick being to kill at a reasonable distance so 
the corrupted doesn't aggro, he's KOS but has a short aggro range, and 
doesn't have any idea who killed  the tainted.  Further, I can kill the 
corrupted, just yesterday someone else did the same thing I do, killed 
tainted and left corrupted be, I was able to come in and take him down, 
although it used 75% of my hp bar.  Trouble is, after killing tainted I 
don't have more than 65% of my hp bar left... not enough to do corrupted!

Which trash mobs have you seen appear at the top of the list?  Totally 
random, or is it something specific?  There's always lots of trash 
around, and I don't mind doing my civic duty by killing them, but would 
just as soon be doing mobs that might spawn what I'm really after.
