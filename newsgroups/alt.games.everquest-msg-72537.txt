There are reasons to want to kill Vox and Naggy other than getting
loot. :-)

I don't remember when he started EQ, but if it was before Kunark, then
Vox and Naggy are special.  I've not managed to find any Vox or Naggy
raids that fit my schedule, and I'm not going to leave 52 until I've
at least been on one of each. :-)

Some of the AA skills are very useful well before 60.  Run speed, for
example, will be very nice in dungeons, so there is an interesting
tradeoff: spend more time in low 50's in order to have an easier trip
through the high 50's.
