....so, you're somehow being harmed by the little news blip that'll go
away on the patcher in a week or so? Seriously, it has zero effect on
you. You're just looking for an excuse to whine, that's all there is
to it. This isn't even remotely similar to DVD trailers that can't be
skipped or telelmarketers. It's not intrusive at all. The patcher
doesn't force you to keep it open any longer than usual. It's not like
it plays noise or anything. It's even less intrusive than an ad in a
magazine or on TV/radio.
