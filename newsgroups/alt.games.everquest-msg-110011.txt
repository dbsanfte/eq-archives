No, constructing a counter-argument is one of many ways to argue.
Attacking an argument successfully creates nothing.  Constructing a
counter-argument is a creative act, and because it is more difficult
to do and the counter-argument itself is then subject to attack it
is far less popular than the comparatively trivial act of sniping at
somebody else's creative effort.

Cleverness is no more a virtue than tallness, shortness, brownness,
pinkness, or most any other -ness.

I call it sophistry because it evades the essential conflict of ideas.
By addressing only selected instances of the use of the words "good"
and "evil" and restricting herself to attacks on John's attempts to
create an argument in support of his position, Lokari avoids any
debate on the question as to whether there is a universal concept
that can be expressed as one of the uses of those words.  Of course,
the existence or non-existence of this universal concept is no more
verifiable than the existence or non-existence of God.  Acknowledging
this would make the debate pretty pointless and deny Lokari the
harmless fun of pointing at the gaping holes in the arguments people
construct in an attempt to prove the truth of their beliefs.
