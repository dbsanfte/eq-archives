I guess I no longer feel bad that my order directly from SOE isn't going to
arrive until Friday... I will give Verant some time to un-f*%$#k their
software and try to explain why everything they told us has gone out the
window.  I am loving the fact that they just lost every Windows 95 using
customer due to being wrong about Direct X version required and making
everyone's life who plays a living hell instead of just those of us who want
to play Luclin... I feel for you all... hope I am not feeling it on Friday
when it arrives.. LOL
