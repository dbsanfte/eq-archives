Ok they are going to rip you a new arse for asking this but I will try
to give you an answer.

Its too much trouble to change now. Im not sure why groups have any
limit (hint hint for EQ2). Time is money and this would require a shit
load of time to change. 

Now I hope this answeres you question and dont be too hard on the ones
that acted  just as lame as you did about the gay thing.
