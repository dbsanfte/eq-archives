The first time I saw this happen I thought it might just be a bug. The
rezzed boss didn't swirl up in the air like a Resurrected player does, and
he didn't stagger like someone using an Awaken, he just stood up and
suddenly had like 25% of his health again. Breath and I saw this again today
in another fight with a large group and noted that this also was a
Freakshow. We figured it must be a trait of theirs.
