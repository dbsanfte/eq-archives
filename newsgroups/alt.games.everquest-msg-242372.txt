Only bought 0% rez for my cleric alt, others did not seem worth it, faster
to fight back up than be rezzed, the 0% can be used if they are bound far
away.

Will get the 50% rez at 34 though :)

Is less mana / time to bind nearby than rez until level 40ish where you
actually notice exp loss a bit (still not much until 50+ really though).

What makes me laugh is the under 40's holding out for a 96%, like its gonna
make much difference.  Get back to exping and you will have your exp back
faster!!!

Found this amusing in pok the other day:

'/ooc newbie: looking for sow and temp for CR!'

'/who newbie'

[13] Newbie (paladin)

Hmm, where can a level 13 be fighting that they need +800hp and sow just to
get their corpse back :/
