By the way... I've heard a lot of higher level beastlords talking about FOL
and how great it is for PvP combat (which I think is debatable, since most
players you'll be casting against will have high MR)... but I don't recall
seeing that on the spell vendors in Shar Vahl.  I probably saw it and passed
it over b/c it's above my lvl but I don't really want to run my beastlord
back there just to find it, so... what lvl do we get that, how much does it
cost, and can I buy it in Shar Vahl or do I need to look somewhere else?

Also... I went to the library in PoK b/c I heard they've got just about all
the spells you can buy for your class, but in the beastlord section I only
found pet lvl buff and pet heal spells, plus a few other misc. spells like
Tiny Companion, which I don't need anyway b/c I have Shrink, which works on
me and my pet both.  Am I just looking in the wrong place, or can I not find
most BL spells in PoK?
