<<<<<Awaiting your response with eager anticipation.  Could this be the one?
Will you hit the mark this time?

My characters are for the most part unaffected so, unfortunately for you, It
won't bother me as much as you hoped.  You have pointed out again though what
type of person you are.  You're the kind that wants others to be unhappy. 
That's too bad.  I just wanted everyone to have fun, even the players who like
KEI and for whom it enhances their gaming.  You'd rather see them miserable. 
It's a very basic difference.  You're a selfish little asshole that wishes that
everyone doesnt do as well as you.  I could care less, I just want to have fun.
