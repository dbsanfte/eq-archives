I have a similar question/problem .
The account I currently play was given to me by my best friend . The poster
who said that regardless if you get caught the account will be banned , has
me worried. I dont have the original disks and my friend says his daughter
smashed the jewel case and he tossed it a long time ago. I  bought my own
copies of the software and already had it installed on my computer when I
switched over to my friends account and let mine lapse.

This is all illegal in Verants eyes? If I am ever asked for my account key
and the one I have dosent match the registered one I am gonna get banned?
What situations should I avoid to assure myself of never being asked for an
account key? If I transfer servers or something do they ask for the account
key?
I have now played over a year with this avatar and all of the billing has
been changed to me . I am now very worried that I am gonna get banned . What
say you?
