This question is contradictory but its pretty clear you mean "green to 
Druid".

No, the exp will be split proportional to their relative experience; for 
the sake of arguement we'll pretend that its split proportional to their 
relative level instead (its not actually the same thing).  Say you have 
a mob which is worth 100 xp, but the two of you kill it together. 
Forgetting about the paladin's level compared to the mob and other 
concerns for the moment, the paladin gets 40 xp and the druid gets 60 
xp, except that since the mob is green to the druid he actually gets 
nothing.  Now 4+.4=1.6 so quadding the paladin gets 160 points while 
doing 0% of the work, it -might- still be faster to exp with the druid 
this way.

In particular, if you are actively killing green to druid mobs in order 
to get trade skill items or something, there's no reason not to group 
the pally with him in order to soak up the free exp.

As long as the druid is doing less damage to the mob than the pally is, 
he can sit around not grouped with the pally and the pally will get 
(again, this is inaccurate, but its in the neighborhood) 2.5 times as 
much exp as he would if the druid was grouped with him.

I -think- that under 55 there's no bonus for killing red to you mobs; so 
oddly the druid will be the one getting more exp out of this, but it 
won't cost the paladin anything; the paladin will get 40 of every 100 
points, but the druid will get something like 62 points because the mob 
is within 5 levels of his level.

I've left out -tons- of other calculations to simplify this for you, but 
the basic ideas are sound.
