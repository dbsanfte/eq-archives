That at least is good to hear.  As somebody who's found two HCL Tal Rasha's 
Armors in less than two weeks in D2, I can say that any RPG-class game 
without great stuff--that's *possible* for every player to attain without 
jumping through continual hoops--is missing a HUGE inducement for continued 
play.  And as a Blizzard game, one would think that WoW will have at least 
that much right.

One would think.
