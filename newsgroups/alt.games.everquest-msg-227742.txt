That's nice.  I noticed you didn't actually say you had never done what I
mentioned above.  Wonder why...

Even the crap gear costs something.  Feel free to continue to deny being a
hypocrite while I continue to be fairly certain that you're just not being
honest, maybe even with yourself.

I have no such issues personally.  I love winning the roll on an item one of
my twinks can use, though my twinks are such that even that is fairly rare
these days.  :)
