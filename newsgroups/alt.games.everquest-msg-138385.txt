I'm hoping you at *least* had a cleric with a pearl since you decided to
do this "just cause they pissed you off"?

I mean, trying to BS you with some fictional list is crap, obviously,
but if anybody takes Rage just out of spite and doesn't even have a
cleric that is ready to finish their epic at that point, then that's
total gutter play. If you did have an epic ready cleric, then IMO the
mob is FIF and nobody could bitch at you for it.

Yes, "technically" the mob (like any) is still FCFS by Verant's PNP if
you don't have a cleric with a pearl, but if somebody kills Ragefire and
has no need for the epic drop, that's really shitty gameplay.
