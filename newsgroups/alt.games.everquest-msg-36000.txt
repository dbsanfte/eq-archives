Need some help with EQ freezing up.

System info:
  Dell PII 1gig
  nVidia2 64
  SBLive
  512 133 ram
  40 gig harddrive (2)
  19" Dell monitor.
  28.8 Modem connection (works fine when NOT freezing up and no other
                                           choices available)

I just uninstalled my drivers for the nVidia and tried to install
regular video driver but says unable to install because of a file in
use. I rebooted and it found the drivers for video. I installed the
latest drivers from nVidia AFTER installing DirectX 8.0a drivers.

Played the game without a glitch for day and half and then WHAM, the
game started freezing up again.

I apologize if this is and old subject but is a fresh subject to me.
Very, very frustrating.

Thanks in Advance
