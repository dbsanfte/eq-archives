A great many people who enjoy Paintball would disagree with you.  Same for
the SCA.  Its all PvP, you win some, you lose some, there are no points,
no "experience" no loot... and yet people do it, and love it.

So, while you may not enjoy the idea, there is clearly a market for it of
some sort.  Trick is to find a way to implement PvP in a RPG type environment,
to tap into -that- market.  EQ is fairly bad at it, DAoC is taking a stab
at it as well.  Killer App?  Who knows.
