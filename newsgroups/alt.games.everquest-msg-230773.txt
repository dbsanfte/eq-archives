Closing in on 63 and, while I have all my 61/62 spells, I don't have any 
63's. (And wizards really want Agnarr's Thunder at 63.) Prices for these 
spells on my server are stupidly high.

I do most of my hunting in a duo with my wife's necro. Where, if 
anyplace, is a possibility to hunt for xp and get some spectral drops? 
I've been told HoH, though I've never been there. We're planning on 
checking it out as soon as Tarre hits 62. (She's a couple yellow short 
of it now.)
