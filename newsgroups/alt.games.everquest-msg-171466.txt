As a newbie, now level 7 Paladin Halfling, I am aware of the fact that I can
use certain spells....

I have spent time in RV and Misty Thicket aquiring my bravefoot armor. I
once tried to travel through kithicor forest, but got kicked pretty quick.

Hitched a ride to Commonlands, and now I am in Freeport.

But the questions are as follows regarding spells.

1. Spirit of Wolf. is it a spell that I can use on myself, or is it a spell
that is used on others?
2. I am aware that spells can be purchased, and i have recieved one (called
courage) from a quest. But how do I know what it does, who it works on etc.
3. Again, when purchasing spells, how does one know if the spell is a
personal one, a used one, attack or defense. Or indeed what the spell
actually does?

I have been given Spirit of Wolf and Skin as Wood on occassions, and this
added speed/protection has been useful. So much so, that I would like to be
able to use such spells on myself, assuming its possible, and I can obtain
them.

Thanks for any assistance.

PS I have also in my RV bank account 50 or so misty acorns, no merchant buys
them, but they are not a "no drop" item so they must be useful for
something? Any ideas?

Thanks again.
