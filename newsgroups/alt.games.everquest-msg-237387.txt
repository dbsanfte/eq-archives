They jump in spurts, at least for me they have. I think I was getting 21 or
22 pts when I was in the mid-50s, then it suddenly jumped to 28-31 points,
then it jumped to 36-41 points. Now at lvl 63 I get 43-47 points depending
on the average level of the group.

Thats all on normal of course, hard adventures get you more points. But I've
thus far found hard adventures to be pretty damn hard to win.
