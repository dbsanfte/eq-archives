Wanna bet your freedom on that ? No laws were reported to have been
broken. None.

Leave your dreams. People being jailed without any claim of laws
being broken happen. Even in democracies. That you don't believe it
shows you lack information, or you fell asleep in history class.

That you believe that, shows you are wrong. Or gullible. Or a fool.

I defend democracy. I think its great. But people have been jailed
with no laws being broken, no police reports were made. It happens.
It has happened. Yes, its a violation of civil rights. But gosh gee
whiz, finding lawyers and courts willing to deal with such things
are recent. Before that everyone official acted like those civil
rights violations never happened.

I have never said they hadn't the right to ban him. I said if he
made a valid complaint they were stupid to ban him.
