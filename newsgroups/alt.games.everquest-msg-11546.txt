I did most of 35 on the ledge in OT and some of it was still
red, I got the last bub and a half in Kaesora on a guild
raid (I refuse to listen when they say nobody goes to a
guild raid for experience, I have dinged every guild raid I
have been on so far heheheh).  Kaesora is strictly BYOG as
are most dungeons any more, and due to it's sort of one way
nature, bring along someone who can evac.  Mistmoore is also
good at 35, but again BYOG.  I have gone back to the ledge
in OT after dinging 40 on a guild raid to Mistmoore.  The
Experience is still good (getting about a bubble for every
four hours played, roughly one a night), but the loot is
crap, though i did get a black pearl of a mob.
