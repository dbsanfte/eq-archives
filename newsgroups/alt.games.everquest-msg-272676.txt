Nice, I did the first part of quest the way it was intended and never
thought about that.

Although having it completed on a server, Bertoxx is the one I think,
was a reasonable reason for ending the quest, I now wonder if the
exploit you discovered might have been a contributing reason. Just
because it was completed on one server should not deny players/guilds
on other servers from trying to complete the quest too. I was trying to
do the second part (Butcherblock port and Freeport) when I and another
quester found the dwarf on the pier didn't give the quest text nor
respond to the quest phrases. Then he despawned.

But if there was an exploit that SOE probably couldn't figure out a
workaround, they'd take the quick solution and deactivate the quest. If
they figure out a way to prevent the exploit, they might reinstate the
quest for awhile (one could hope).
