At lower levels....

1. Groups with KEI do not need back-up healers/nukers, etc. This makes
it harder for non-KEI'd players to find groups. (The same applies to
mega-buffs on melees)

2. Players with KEI do not need to group. This makes it harder for
non-KEi'd players (especially melee classes) to find groups.

3. Groups are MUCH more likely to take a caster with KEI over one
without. Go to any popular zone prior to the patch and you would see
"/shout LevelXX <Caster> w/KEI LFG"

In all cases players that do not use KEI or do not benefit from it (eg
melee classes) are affected negatively. The above are just a couple of
examples with regards to how it adversly affected gameplay. I am sure
you will discount them, and continue to spout off that no one has
given you an answer to your question.
