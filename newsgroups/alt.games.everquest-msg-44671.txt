Me am a Troll Shadow Knight from Grobb. Me was lucky and getted a
whole bunch of munny early (me ended up wif 230pp at lebel 9). Me
decided ta be a blacksmith, so me started makin' stuff wif my munny.
Me got ta 67 skill, and me not knows how ta keep goin' wif my
smithin'. Me has 108pp left, but me cannot gets da skewer molds
anywhere. How am me supposed ta go higher den 67 in smithin' if me
cannot gets da skewer molds? Me haves lots of smarts, so me learn
kinda fast, but me kinda fails alot, and me not gets good prices on
stuff.

/ooc This means I have a fairly high intelligence (80), but a low
wisdom(60 sumpin'), and even lower charisma(40 sumpin...mebee even 30
sumpin)

So what me do ta keep goin' and lernin' ta make metil stuff?
