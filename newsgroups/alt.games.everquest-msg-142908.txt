Decent but not astounding armor.. .but any mana not spent killing the mob
is mana wasted, and roots are a lot cheaper than heals.  While I've tanked
mobs to death in order to keep my union card (defensive skill) up, I
generally prefer not getting hit unless I meant to,

You are looking at this backwards; I'm getting exp while doing the
chores, while the alternative is to NOT get exp while doing chores.

Ah, but if you were required to read People for your job, or your wife
wanted you to make sure to get People read... you see what I'm saying,
its not that I"m interrupting EQ to do RL, its that I can squeeze in some
EQ into my RL schedule.  Thus, it IS helping me to achieve my EQ goals,
since the alternative would be to read People all day and not play EQ
at all.

Yep, was another reason I kicked myself for not being born a DE,
missing Hide asnd Sneak.  UV, which people crow about, doesn't
interest me, dwarf vision seems fine, as in "oh, is it night out?  Sorry
I didn't notice"

On the other hand, I'm so steamed about the snare item that Hide
doesn't really torture me much.
