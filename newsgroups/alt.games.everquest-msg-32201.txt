Agreed, sometimes people who can cast are just assholes, and cast on you and
assume you wanted what they cast.
Had a ogre shaman buff me in Oasis once when i was just sitting and helping the
newbies. After he was done buffing he asked for donations please.
Hey, if someone cast something on me i dont ask for, i dont mind giving a sow or
so, if its something i can use.
But if someone just run around in Oasis buffing everyone in sight, and then get
offended because they dont donate for it, it kinda stupid.
