So? He'd have more survivability while fumbling.
Plus, from anything I've read with someone using "mommy's plastic",
the parents barely let them have the monthly fee for EQ so they'd not
let them go hog wild buying stuff.

Actually, they never mentioned power leveling for cash.

There again, they never really mentioned anything like that. I did not
read selling plat but items I thought.

Honestly I don't see anything wrong with what they ask about in the
poll. It sounded to me like it would simply be little bobby wanting to
sell a lodizal shield for 10 bucks or something and someone else
wanting to buy it for 10 bucks with SOE being the go-between in a
secure transaction area. People do this already, without SOE, and it
is SOE's game. 

I honestly would not see anything changing. The only thing that would
change is that someone like me, who would never buy an item from a
third party now, might buy that one item once in a blue moon for 10-50
bucks that they could never get by camping. Perhaps I'd buy it around
my birthday or christmas, with the item being one I'd never have the
cash for in game. Such an item might be something like Flowing Slime
Boots, they are reguarly 80 k plat on my server and I never felt I
could afford that, nor did I want to chance buying them from some
third party seller through a third party site.

So, my 56 level druid having flowing slime boots would totally ruin
the game for you? I really can't see that. They are not going to
change the way I play, they are not going to get you killed in LDON.
They are just going to make me feel better about the character and
give me a very tiny power increase, in terms of mana regen.

What would happen is people would try to sell anything, if it was done
the way auction is done in game now. Very soon, it would become very
clear that only things such as the flowing slime boots would sell. If
the average person in the 50's could get an item without actually
"buying it" for real world money, then they would. This service would
only be for those droppable items which are camp/purchase
impossibilities for the average player.

For the most part absolutely nothing would change, since anyone who
could afford to go hog wild before likely would have already on Yantis
or IGE. Its only people like me who can't really afford it would would
finally buy that "one" item, as a special occasion thing, since it was
secure through SOE.

I'm really not seeing the problem with this, in a game in its twilight
days. Knowing SOE, if they did this it would be fairly regulated and
likely not be platinum or leveling for sale.

The only server this might be a problem on would be Firiona Vie. On
every other server items are rare which fit in the flowing slime boots
or cloak of flames higher plat category, which would likely be the
kind of items mainly sold.
