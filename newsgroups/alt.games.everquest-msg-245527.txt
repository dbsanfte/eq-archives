Quest armor, I have looked over some of this for the appropriate class and
some of it is pretty nice! Currently the one that I�ve been working the most
with is ally to the Coldain because she�s been soloing those giants all
except the Elite, did however manage to duo a Captain in EW though. Her
equipment of course could stand some updates but I have opted for the shawl
and ring quests.

Oh yeah! I�d forgotten about that vial I�ve got in the bank thanks for
reminding me. Usually carry the 10 dose gate potion on me but the vial sure
will come in handy too.

King Tormax, well now I just looked at a few things dropped off of him and
wouldn�t you know that a few of the items that I�ve been wanting drops off
him! Sooner or later with raid, I hope to take this guy out but from the
list of drops and the quest to do with his head I am sure that this must be
an often desired target... faction with Kromrif currently could not possibly
get any worse.

How high does this faction have to be to be ally to the Velious dragons if
now ally to the Coldain, is it directly parallel?

Looks like a raid to Kael might be in the near future, hopefully.

May also start working on the Yelniak faction. There will always be someone
who hates you, npc and pc inclusive.
