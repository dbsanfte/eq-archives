Unless you have played AC for any length of time I would ask you to kindly
STFU. The monthly "updates" in AC were so bug ridden that it wasnt even
funny. The common wisdom was "Never play on Patch Day" in AC. Add to that
the fact that exploits ran RAMPANT, and More or less with the blesing of the
developers ( IE Exp chains, Macroing, and the likes ), and Ill GLADLY Pay
for a an expansion every now and again.

Oh and lets not forget the one time that Turbine came out with an Expansion
that you pay for and what did you get for that ? Not a whole lot really.
Access to another landmass, and a few unique items.

No, all things considered Ill take the EQ model for running an MMORPG over
the MS/Turbine methodology any day of the week and twice on Sunday.
