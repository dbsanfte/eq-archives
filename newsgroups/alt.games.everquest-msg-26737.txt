Out of curiosity and not to take away from the urgency of your post, but is
your Win2kpro install updated to the lastest service pack (2)?  I wondered
about that and if you're running the latest directx layer since I didn't see
mention of it.  Other than that, its a head-scratcher - seems like an ideal
EQ box.

You *do* have too much memory though, I'll take a 256mb stick off you if you
need to lighten up a bit =P
