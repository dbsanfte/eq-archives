Generally the same here, except a third added, as I've said whenever
this topic comes up- A nicely roleplayed request such as (me in wolf
form):

player1: /em scratches behind Calris's ear. "Pardon me, kind druid,
could you imbue me with the wolf's spirit, please?"

I generally give a nice in-character response and a full compliment of
buffs for this type of request. This request could have been macro'd
or he could have actually taken the time to type it. It doesn't
matter. The point is, there's some creativity and roleplay in the
request. They take my purple nametag seriously enough and show me
enough respect to deserve a little something extra.
