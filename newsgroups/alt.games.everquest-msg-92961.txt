Spend the points on Fletching and work the rest of the way up to skill 56...
that's the trivial for the longest range arrows.

Work your way towards your Trueshot Bow... you can collect the components at
your level (you just have to travel to Steamfont to hunt *grin*)

Trueshot + longrange arrows gives you a combo that can pull from a distance
no spell (other than Flamebolts) can reach... plenty of time to cast a Snare
on it ;o)
