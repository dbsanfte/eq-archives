Well, hopefully someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there
a time when if you gave /consent for someone to drag your corpse, they
also were able to loot your corpse?  And maybe because of a lot of
complaints from players getting ripped off by someone they had
/consented who took all their stuff, they changed the command so you
could still give /consent to drag your corpse but they couldn't loot
your stuff?  Maybe that's what you were thinking of?
