Befallen Sucks.  It's a small key needed zone.  

Once you hit 24 (I stayed in paludal until 26) there's Mistmoore, Unrest
(actually good from about 14-40 good spot for a SK/Cleric combo with
lots of undead), Echo Caverns, Splitpaw, Crystal Caverns (don't like). 
All as far as Dungeons go.  Possibly Upper Guk or Sol A as well.   My
favorite zone used to be Cazic at about 30, but they f'd it up - they
were changing it because no one went there any more, but now no one goes
there even less.
