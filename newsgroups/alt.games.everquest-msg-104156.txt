Also, put up your LFG tag. My normal group often finds itself one melee or
one healer short, and we peruse the LFG pool to look for our 6th. Once we
see who is available, we send tells inviting them to where we are hunting,
if they say yes, we meet up and port to our new fighting location.

I've also been contacted this way several times for groups. Sometimes the
group sucks, but one of the nice perks about being 50+ is that the idiot
level is much lower than say 20-30.

For those that don't know, if your group is looking for a 50-55th warrior to
complete your group, you can do /who war 50 55 lfg all to see who is
available. Same goes for all classes and levels. You can even do /who 50-55
lfg all if you need two or more or just wanna see who is out there.

Mullo 55 Druid.
