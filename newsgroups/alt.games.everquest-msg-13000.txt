I think you are right, they are trying to sound cool. And it is the younger
players that do it. I susect that this newsgroup has a much higher average
age than exists for the game itself, and that is why it is so common
in-game, and so frowned upon here.

I wonder what people do if they get in a group and groupmates ask for buffs
in that manner, Would they immediately leave the group, and if so, do you
tell the group the reason for it?

I can't get over the feeling that it is in the same vein as adults in my
youth asking "How can you listen to that awful music. It all sounds the
same. It has no tune. The words are stupid"
