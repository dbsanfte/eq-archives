Doesn't anyone follow the instructions?

They are clearly on the everquest home page.

There are 400 people saying the same thing.

Could they possibly all make one post and reply to it for the message "No D3D
Device found?"

Do people just post and not look above them.


Download and install Direct X 8.1

Download and install NEWEST video drivers.

If you have nvidia chipset, get the reference drivers from www.nvidia.com
If you have ati chipset.....hmmm....lets seee.......www.ati.com

If any of these people that are having the Directx problems had done both of the
above steps there would be no problems.

Installing DirectX is not enough.  You have to have , in some cases, DirectX
video drivers, which are the newest ones.

If I see any more of these "I am a moron, I get a DirectX error message that 400
other people get and I don't know how to follow directions" ill scream.




I know ill prob get flamed for this post, but the eagerness to play the game is
overshadowing the common sense of following directions  properly to get it
running.
