Hiya

Good responses all , and real nice to see so many positive comments.  What
came out of it is that most of you like guilds and play the game for the
same reasons I do.

I was interested in the guild too small / guild too large thing  as my
reason for asking was that sometimes I feel I may as well not be in a guild.
Having said that I am in a diff timezone by about 7 hours and its a
relatively small guild , so not a huge surprise.

That'll do.

Thanks

S.
