>where should level 41 Paladin fight?

Depends on if you want to group or solo.

Solo, there are a myriad of places. One of the best places I would recommend
is the haunted pyramid in DL right by the Spires. You can solo this place
with KEI with some downtime at your level. The key is to single pull out of
the pyramid and run to the pyramid to the left of the one that has the skels
in it. Run to the pyramid to the left and make sure the skel chases you.
Once in the pyramid, run to the corner on the left as you are running
through the pyramid. Once there, turn around and the skel is prob right
there on your tail. Fear it. If you fear it, it will run from you but be
trapped in that corner. Proceed beating it on the back till fear drops. Fear
it again and then beat it down again. If you want, keep fearing it before
the fear wears off. If you do this, you prob won't loose much health.
Group, find a chain pulling group in DL proper around KC. Generally lots of
groups around to pick from. The benefit to this is that it's a quick jaunt
into KC and stick your head in and see if anyone would want you in their
group. KC is a great place for us pallies in the 50's. Get some experience
now if you can for later on.

Hope that helps.
