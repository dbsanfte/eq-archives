Keep in mind he is talking about 2ish groups, with one of the groups 
being under 60, and one being 60-70, and equipment levels being pre 
elemental I have to assume, also pre VT I have to assume.  From having 
done many of your suggestions with that type of gear and level ranges, it 
took significantly more than 2 groups to do them at that time.  Barring 
me being totally mistaken about the numbers and/or equipment levels, I'd 
rule out Xanamech, HoH trials, probably Paffa, Mujaki (just not enough 
bodies to keep the spawns occupied, or at least making it very 
difficult), Shei I agree with, Rumblecrush and the Zelniak would be very 
iffy, KT I'd be very surprised if they can manage, Sontalek as well.  If 
they want to try some of those dragons, I'd start with easier ones first 
to see what they can actually tackle.  I know that at level 70 with good 
gear, most of those mobs are now single groupable, or even less than a 
full group.
