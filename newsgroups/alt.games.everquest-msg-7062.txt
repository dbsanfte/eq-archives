funny you mention that:

last night, while running around Rathe Mountains, ironically enough, looking
for Hasten to get my JBoots..I saw more than one shout asking about 'sow
boots that could be bought for money'.  I attributed it to someone
misunderstanding what JBoots are and how one goes about getting them...
hmmm...and I'm on Innoruuk...Mass Hysteria perhaps?
