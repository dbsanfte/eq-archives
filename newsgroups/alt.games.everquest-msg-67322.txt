I'll start by saying this was way stupid of the party involved but it 
happened so here goes.

I am out hunting my necro when I get a tell asking me who my guild 
leader is.  Guild leader isn't on but I am an officer so I ask if I can 
help the lady.  Turns out that she gave one of my guild mates RL son a 
large sum of PP (10k) to hold and he promptly logged off.  My guildie 
was there at the time and she logged off too.  The son logged in and I 
sent him a tell asking him to return it since my guild mate said it was 
an LD problem that caused him to log.  He instantly went anon and would 
not reply to my tells.  The person that gave him the PP said she went to 
a GM and was told she is SOL.  I personally don't agree.  This kid said 
he would do something for her and didn't.  I have read here alot about 
people getting scammed and GMs getting into the middle of it.

So, I have 2 questions here.  First is, what should I do about my 
guildie here since it is looking like she helped to cheat this lady out 
of her money?

And second is, what is the deal with this GM?  Was it just someone that 
doesn't follow Verant policy too well and the lady should petition it 
again?  Or is this something that has really left her hanging?
