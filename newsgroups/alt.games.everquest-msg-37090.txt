Sense heading is one of the only skills that will ONLY increase on
success. Most, if not all, other skills still have a chance to
increase on failure.

...and how do you nearly kill yourself with bind wounds? Bind wounds
*NEVER* fails. MEND, however, can criticly fail, dealing damage. Mend
skill can raise on failures, too. Otherwise, it would never go up. ;-p
