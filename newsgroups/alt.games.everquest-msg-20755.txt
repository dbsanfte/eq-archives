Certainly copyright law doesn't restrict the consumer from re-selling
the tangible media upon which copyrighted work is contained (be it
book, CD, sculpture, or what have you).

This is where I start to find your position suspect. As a copyright
holder with items on file in the LoC, I've read a fair amount of
copyright law, and I don't recall seeing any restrictions on loaning.
If such restrictions existed, it would make things quite difficult for
the local public library.

An interesting theory, and not the first time I've seen it set forth.
However, it begs in my mind a question... if a case could be made as
you describe, why hasn't it happened? Per Verant, there are 400,000
current subscribers - that's a *huge* consumer base, and doesn't even
take into account past subscribers. Surely somewhere along the line at
least a few of them were disgruntled enough over the policy to at
least call up a lawyer.
