Yeah I do remember having to call guides for that...but maybe you needed 
  them to pull it out because you needed to target your corpse for 
/corpse to work at the time??

I'd swear I used corpse dragging with my first character at low level, 
on rallos zek back in the early days... i played a shadowknight and got 
waxxed by gaurds & merchants & npc regularly...for example I distinctly 
remember dying in the campfire (it was empty and I thought it was a 
logical place to sit, until the millers popped and butchered me on the 
spot) in Qeynos Hills by the glade zone in... and later creeping up an 
inch at a time trying to pull my corpse away before the Millers aggroed.

Then again... its been a loooong time... maybe i was just trying to loot 
at maximum range...

  I don't remember when it did exactly, I just remember that

I remember that change too.
