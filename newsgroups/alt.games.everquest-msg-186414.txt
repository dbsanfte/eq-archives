Well, that's just the point. With MC3, you would have (in theory,
simplistically) 30pc more mana so you don't go OOM as quickly. That's about
3 more CHeals which is quite significant.

Also, I can see it making a big difference for Wizzies and Mages as well.

There have been quite a few occasions where there was a bad pull and I've
gone OOM and sat to meditate just to get enough mana to cast the one or two
more heals that allowed us to just barely pull out a victory.
