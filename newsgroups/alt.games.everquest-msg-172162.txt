Astrologer Sydney Omarr dies at 76

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Astrologer-to-the-stars Sydney Omarr, whose horoscope =
column in newspapers across the country was one of the first things many =
readers turned to in the morning, has died at 76.

Omarr, blind and paralyzed from the neck down by multiple sclerosis, =
died Thursday at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica from =
complications from a heart attack.

His own horoscope for that day was upbeat.

``You will beat the odds, much to the astonishment of experts,'' =
predicted the six-line forecast that Omarr had dictated three months =
prior.

Omarr, known to friends as a true Leo personality -- the Zodiac sign =
symbolized by the lion -- for his sharp mind, chivalrous manner and love =
of fine dining and cigars, was popular with politicians, sheiks, =
celebrities and the public because his predictions were generally =
considered to ring true, associates said.

``The column itself was general, but he had a system for doing it,'' =
said Valerie Barbeaux, his companion and editorial adviser. ``We often =
kept letters, they said they (the horoscopes) were right on.''

Although his vision vanished a decade ago and his crumbling health =
required him to rely on attendants around the clock, his mind remained =
sound and his spirits high. Omarr worked until suffering a massive heart =
attack on Dec. 23.

An article last month in the Los Angeles Times chronicled Omarr and =
Barbeaux at work; he lying in bed with his head propped up on pillows, =
she poised before an old IBM Selectric II typewriter prepped with a =
blank sheet and carbon paper:

``Syd, this is for Friday, Dec. 6 ... moon in Capricorn. Aries,'' said =
Barbeaux.

``Expect some changes in connection with business, career,'' replied =
Omarr in a monotone. ``Written word plays major role; get ideas on =
paper.''

``We need another line, Syd,'' prodded Barbeaux.

``Flirtation begins innocently but could become hot and heavy,'' he =
divined after a brief pause.

Born Sidney Kimmelman in Philadelphia, Omarr decided to change his name =
at age 15 after watching the movie ``Shanghai Gesture,'' starring Victor =
Mature as a character named Omar. He changed the spelling of his first =
name and adopted Omar as his last name, but added a second ``r,'' in =
accordance with certain numerological formulas.

Omarr became fascinated with numerology and astrology as a teen. He =
wrote a book called ``Sydney Omarr's Private Course on Numerology,'' and =
sold copies for $2. He also started analyzing the horoscopes of movie =
stars for magazines.

His career began to take off after he enlisted in the Army at 17. Omarr =
was sent to Okinawa during World War II, where his weekly Armed Forces =
Radio program, ``Sydney Omarr's Almanac,'' made him the first and only =
GI assigned astrology duty.

After the war he took journalism courses at Mexico City College. His =
first job after college was for United Press as a news reporter. One of =
his first assignments was to interview Goodwin Knight, California's =
Republican governor, who had been reading Omarr's columns for years. The =
two men became good friends.

Omarr later spent a decade as a CBS radio newsman before becoming a =
full-time columnist and astrological consultant to Hollywood stars.

He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1971 but continued his work =
and appeared on television shows hosted by Mike Douglas, Johnny Carson =
and Merv Griffin.

Omarr wrote 13 books -- one for each of the 12 signs of the zodiac and =
one for the entire year. The books were updated annually. He has sold 50 =
million copies nationwide.

Defending astrology as both a science and an art was a lifelong passion =
for Omarr, associates said. Over the years, he managed to make a =
believer out of Tammy Smalls, wife of Omarr's friend and assistant Paul =
Smalls.

``He was just right on,'' said Smalls. ``I don't even believe in =
astrology. When I met my husband, I said, 'Who do you work for?' We even =
got married on the day that he said.''

His column, which is owned by the Tribune Co., appears in more than 200 =
daily newspapers. Arrangements were being made for his assistants to =
continue producing the column under Omarr's name, the Times reported.

His column is probably created by a computer.

Omarr is survived by his sister, Leah Lederhandler of Philadelphia.
