It sounds like you died while linkdead.

Necros, Bards and ShadowKnights can locate the corpses of dead
players. If there are other players in the zone, you could try asking
for assistance.

Another option is to /petition while in-game. I don't know whether or
not a GM or Guide will help you, but it doesn't hurt to try.
