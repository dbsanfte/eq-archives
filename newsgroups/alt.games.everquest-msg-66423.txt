....bring back some of the lower level spells, not just the high level ones,
because you're more likely to sell the lower level ones, at least from what
I've seen so far.

I'm on the Rathe server, and I've seen a lot of people trying to sell high
level SoL spells in EC, but I don't think they're selling too well. On the
other hand, I've seen a lot of people asking for lower level SoL spells, but no
one is bothering to pick them up and bring them back. I myself need Focus
Death, which is a level 12 Necro spell from Luclin, and I know one other player
needs it, too.
