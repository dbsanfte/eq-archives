OK here are the responses

Software First:

Thank you for your email.

I am sorry but this item has now been cancelled by the publishers so we
are unable to supply it.

If there is anything else you wish to order in its place please contact
us.

Sorry again

Regards
Jamie

Game/EB:

Thank you for your email.  I am afraid that we have now completely sold 
out
of this title and are unable to supply you with another copy.  The only
thing I could suggest would be to call the distributors and see if they 
can
tell you of any other retailers that may still have stock left, or they 
may
be able to get a copy to you directly.  They are called - UBI - soft and 
can
be contacted on - 01932 838 230.  I hope this helps.


I have emailed and phoned Ubisoft and await there response. First 
impressions are that they are closing the product pending the release of 
another. The one that was mentioned was EQ Platinum which I guess will 
contain the main pack and all the add ons. However the releaser date for 
that of the 1/3/2002 didn't make this a very good idea.

Anyway will keep everyone posted. If anyone has a way of getting Sony to 
have a chat with UBisoft it would seem a good move on what seems a 
ludicrous situation

Miles
