Except Dain is a melee mob :)  (well, he does banish to the well.. but he
can't really count as a caster w/gate)

We had that a long time ago, but it was a warrior.  I don't think he was
even out of agro range of *any*body (MA usually stands a few steps forward,
but is in range for heals - and most certainly in range to pass agro to all
of us)

Statue walked down.. killed him.. and walked back.  lol.  He was an ogre..
so maybe Statue wasn't so hungry anymore
