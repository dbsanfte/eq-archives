Apparently the video clips that SoE use to show off EQ2 are not pre rendered 
clips at all, they are actual game footage taken using some extra settings 
on the engine not currently available to users.

It was stated that they used the absolute top quality setup to create these 
clips but even so it really shows just how impressive the engine is.  I cant 
wait for a year or so to when the technology filters down to the customer. 
Not that that game doesnt look great anyway :)
