Just wondering whether anyone else has occasionally experienced the keyboard
'locking up' while in game.. only happens very rarely, but cannot move, can
move the camera view around, but only way of saying anything in game is by
scrolling back up with the mousewheel and editting something you said
earlier.
By mashing the caps lock and shift key, I can get around it.. but just
wondered whether anyone else has a better solution, or do we just wait until
the next patch to fix a patch comes out?
