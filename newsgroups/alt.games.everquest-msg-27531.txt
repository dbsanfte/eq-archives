Grin, my "sense" hotkey is actually a social that does

/doability <forage>
/doability <sense heading>
/loc

Very handy ;)

I used to have an irritating time getting my initial bearing to work out
what direction to run for the loc, but combining your initial loc with the
heading you're on makes it trivial ;)

(ok, I'm at -200 400 and I want to be at -1000 -300 so I need to head 
southeast...)
