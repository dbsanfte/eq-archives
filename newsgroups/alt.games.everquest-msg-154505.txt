If there is any sort of trouble like this, it shouldn't be a secret, it
should be very public.  I'd never in a million years guess that
my guild would have any problem with me killing a mob that
wasn't engaged or camped and looting it.  So if such a thing
is dealt with secretly, I'm still just as likely to violate this hidden
rule sometime in the future.  I'd be far better off knowing exactly
where that line is drawn, being able to debate its wisdom, and
being able to guildremove politely if the line is not movable and
I strongly disagree with it.

The first time a violation occurs, its quite possible that such
a thing was unforseen.  But once its happened, the "rule" on
it should be decided and made guild public knowledge.
