Though that is using game strategics to resolve a non-strategic situation.
Not putting down your suggestion, since it really is about the only option,
though never-the-less, it would be nice for them to do -something- about it.

It doesn't affect me personally, I have the luxary of affording a P4 with
1GB of RAM to run on my cable modem, but, some dont unfortunately... maybe
VI could buy all those that NEED IT (you know NB4G) a new computer (ie. phat
73w7z, sorry, Im not a skilled d00dspeak type). <grin> Though, its more
likely I will get on the head by an asteroid (well meteor to be technically
correct) than that happening.. ;)

Naw, create another character if you like the race/class you are playing so
much, then that way VI is almost ensured you will subscribed longer. <grin>
:(
Atleast thats probably their mindset.

Full guides I'll add.  Those of you wanting to do this as "appies," sorry.

I believe technically, this should be considered a bug, or at best,
certainly VI's "fault" whenever this happens.. since pressing those
combination of key(s) -is- a normal operating specification/behavior of the
OS in which EQ is made to run on. <shrug> But, again, to think VI would ever
accept that as -their- fault... refer to meteor comment. ;p

Whenever someone claims to be underworld /loc is not only used by the player
when filling out a /report (assuming they listen to their friendly guide,
hehe) and by the guide him/herself whenever confirming (in those few cases
its not obvious [ie. you are obviously under the ground staring up at the
sky or in the sky itself]) said user is "under" world.  These /loc's are
also to be reported on the guide message forums whenever retrieving someone
from "under" world.  In other words, I haven't the faintest idea why they
wouldn't want to keep this feature in permenantly.  Not saying you are wrong
or a liar, but, rather, it seems far too useful by both "sides" to NOT have
it. <shrug>

All too true.. unless its a "flying" dwarf rat and they just "forgot" to
label it as such.. or a "jumping" dwarf rat, etc, etc... <grin>
