I don't think I was taking many hits by level 18.

So just agro kite...I was doing cougars in ICO from 24 or 25 til 29?  

I sure as hell wasn't tanking in any way shape or form.

Engulfing isn't great but it does the job well enough.  There is no
chance in hell you will be taking those hits though...A couple rounds
with or without gear and you are toast.  I would just recommend for a
shoestring Necro, if you cant get SOW, SOW potions, JBoots, etc...,
that you send the pet and then snare.  The pet won't last long but it
will give you some extra time to get a snare off if the first one is
resisted.

Wear what you pick up off of the mobs you kill for now.  Don't spend
more than 50 plat on any piece of gear at your level if this is your
first character and you are poor.  Here's the thing, most of the best
loot is no-drop or level-restricted.  If you spend a bunch of money on
AC gear (even if a "bunch" is a couple hundred plat), you will simply
find that you have gear that is worthless to you very soon.  You will
also find that those weeks you spent as a lowby, farming money, could
have been better spent getting you to high levels faster where you can
*really* farm for stuff.

Farm 50 plat an hour at your level or farm 50k plat an hour at level
65?
