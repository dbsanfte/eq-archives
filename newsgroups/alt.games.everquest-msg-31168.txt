Referring to the Goddess of Love angle, or the message board wars?

>havent heard 1 opinion of someone from the Zeks

Perhaps because you're not really looking for the Zek opinions, you're
just trying to convince everyone that PvP is sooo great...

There's one thing I've been wondering about: Why do so many immature
Zek players feel the need to post flame bait about bluebie servers
being inferior to PvP servers? Are you so insecure about the server
you chose to play on that you have to shout in everyone's ears that
you have the best server, just to convince yourself?

The good Zek players are the ones who don't feel a need to boast about
it being better than the blue servers.
