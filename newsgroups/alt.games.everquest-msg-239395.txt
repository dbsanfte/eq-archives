Also, it's an 18sec mez with a 6.5sec recast. In practice, I can keep one
and a half mobs mezzed if that's *all* I do. And unlike enchanters, necros
do not get the Color Flux line to give themselves enough breathing space
to recast mez when it breaks. Root doesn't show up in the necro spell
lineup until 34, either. So, for me at least, mezzing was more of a
stunt when you got an extra add. If you got 3 extra adds, you ran for the
zone line.

Feigning death before mez wears off is a great way to shed agro tho.
