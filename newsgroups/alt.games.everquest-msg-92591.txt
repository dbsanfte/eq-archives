I have a 45 wiz alt, trying to get him planable ASAP.  I find it amazing how
much damage he can do if aggro isn't an issue (haven't run across a time
when it wasn't, yet).  My enchanter at level 56 can nuke for 635 with I
think 6-12 seconds recast?   My wizard at *45*...610 chain nuking.  Hell, at
level 40 he was out damaging my enchanter (yeah I know, enchanter isn't an
offensive class but there's lots of times where nuking is perfectly ok) but
now he just blows the enchanter away.

My first "main" was a druid and druids are fun and useful.  He's level 52
and has been porting for over 2 years. Wizard translocates are just plain
COOL.  Wizards don't get bugged for stuff nearly as often as my druid,
enchanter, or (if I'm playing him) my brother's cleric.  Wizards aren't
expected to keep anyone alive or think too much...simply to nuke and avoid
getting hit (so some brains are required).  It's a great little diversion
from what I'm used to.

Plus, the wizard is on my 2nd computer and it's SIMPLE to play enchanter and
wizard at the same time.  Lots o' fun to be had. <g>
