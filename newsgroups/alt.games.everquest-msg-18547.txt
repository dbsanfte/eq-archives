The prologue is a bit wooden, but the narrative picks up considerably
when you get to the actual story.  Despite the occasional awkward
choice of words ("protruding dagger" -- learn to cut adjectives and
especially adverbs which don't add anything to your meaning), I
believe you show some writing talent and I encourage you to continue
writing, if perhaps not to show every single effort to the general
public :)

As with anything else, one's ability to write solid prose increases
with practice.  Keep at it.
