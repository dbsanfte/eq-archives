Go Fear kiting Zelniaks (snare-terrorize animal) in Dawnshroud, should bring
you to lvl 41 .Then get a group in echo Caverns till 45. Then root and dot
the blues.
Try getting a Elder Spirit's Vambraces at 45. Nice free dot.
This should bring you to lvl 48. Currently stuck at that lvl.

So any suggestions for a 48 druid?
