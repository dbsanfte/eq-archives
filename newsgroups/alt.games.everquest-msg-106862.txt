 I could see that. That's why examples like that aren't that great.
People solo where it's most efficient. Where their strengths allow them
to do so. So a mid 50s level monk can't solo in Sebilis very well. There
all sorts of zones where they can. There will always be a zone where one
class can solo better than another.

 I'll probably try that this week. Only bad thing is SS is pretty
uncamped for the most part on my server so if I die finding a res will
be fun. Not to mention having to drag my corpse all the way back to the
zone. Not a big deal other than the first room after the fountain since
those caster drakes see invis. Easy enough to get out of LoS in the next
two rooms to feign, though.

 We've done these before with 4 of us. The cubes have high resists so
often resist snare even after being maloed. Not to mention those cubes
that split are a pain in the ass.

 Those along with the big golem guy on the other side. Forgot his name
offhand but that's a fun fight with a small group as well.
