This 3.5 year period will be a time of peace born of utter folly and
arrogance that could only be described as insanity. The U.S. soldiers will
stay stationed in the middle East while being restrained from doing anything
with George W. Bush being the only one in power who recognizes the need for
action while the U.S. population, the U.N., and all other nations will not
let him, while Iraq, North Korea, China, Russia, etc. build armies and
stockpile weapons totally unchecked while we sit back, thinking the world is
at peace.

Hillary Rodham Clinton will be elected in the next election as women will
want to finally prove their goddesshood and pagan wisdom borne of
substanceless ether before the world, man and God, at this point God will
become enraged, as that is just insane to elect a female president (insane
to elect a female president in any situation, more on this in another post)
when WWIII is about to start and brutally punish the U.S., except the 4
areas I mentioned earlier which will be relatively spared as the people who
live there still put faith in God, not to mention that the two Rev. 11
prophets live in the U.S.

I would expect something akin to the entire U.S. army walking onto a desert
plain and being nuked at some point in the future. The whole point of this
exercise is to prove how fallible humans are when they reject God, and to
make it completely obvious to anyone who bothers to open their eyes and see
what is happening.

George W. Bush is completely justified in wanting to attack Iraq and or
North Korea in order to keep them from blooming out of control, and in any
other time, he would be considered a good president, maybe even a great one.
The economy has fallen apart not because of anything he did but because all
our wealth is now being distributed to the rest of the world.

I read in the paper that Bush was going to attack them anyway even without
help from anyone else, and I pray that he does so that when he is voted out
of power even when our armies are winning then it would be completely
apparent that the world has gone insane.

I also believe that God will bless the U.S. army while Bush is president and
uses the army to do what needs to be done as someone who is sane and
rational would do.

Clinton will win the next election in 2004, there is no escaping that, don't
try to rig the election so she can't win, she will, unless she were to step
down of course in which case the whole prophecy would still be completed but
fewer men would die in the long run as an extra 18 months with Bush in
office before June 2006 could make a big difference in the balance of power
in that region.
