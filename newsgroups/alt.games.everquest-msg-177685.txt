Not entirely true.  While the player vendor count is usually only
around 40-50 (up from 30-40 last December), and thus the selection
of items available is limited, prices are better described as highly
chaotic than high.  My Ogre Warrior has a Centi LS (350pp, cheaper
than I've yet seen a Centi SS on Test), an FBSS (1kpp, they're 1600-
2k on Tunare), and a Jarsath Trident (300pp, not sure about live
price for this one) for which I was very pleased with the prices.
A lot of the cheapo caster gear tends to be higher priced (250pp
avg price for Moonstone Ring is just silly), but Acrylia tailored
stuff is about normal.  Because of the smallish number of player
vendors you cannot necessarily find what you want when you want it
at the price you want to pay, but if you're patient, and stop by
often to check, you can find enough bargains to fill out your kit.
Park a mule there to sell stuff from time to time you'll be helping
to make the server's market more vibrant.  Just gotta remember that
Test's bazaar is pretty volatile (pricewise) and shop accordingly.
