I would advise you to start some easy class to look around, and then 
choose when you've collected some more information. In my opinion druid 
or warrior are easy choices, any race that can see in the dark. That 
would exclude barbarians, humans and erudites

> Mainly soloing, combat with some magic?

Generally in Everquest combat does not go together with soloing, 
especially if you add magic.
I think the two closest ones would be shaman and shadowknight.
If you are looking for a solo king, you may want to choose a necromancer, 
though you would have to forget about combat :)

If you stop on a shadowknight, I'd go with either troll or ogre. Either 
way, it would be a fairly tough character to start with, due to horrible 
faction, and nasty experience penalty
With a necro you can't really go wrong with the race. The easiest faction 
for a necro is gnome, the best (IMO) race from efficiency standpoint is 
Iksar, the most interesting from roleplaying perspective is Dark Elf, and 
I'm not too familiar with Erudites
