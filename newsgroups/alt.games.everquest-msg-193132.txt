    Other people in game owe you nothing beyond what the PNP compels them to
give you. They may be nice and do more than that, but never expect it of
them or demand it of them.

    It is a competitive environment. You want to complete the quest for the
Fuzzy Foozle? You better hope someone else isn't camping the NPC that drops
the quest item. Like to raid? Better move fast, or the mobs you wanted to
kill will already be dead and you'll be left looking for something else to
do. Like to tradeskill? Sorry, the component mobs are camped and the
ingredients that were for sale in The Bazaar were bought out one hour ago by
someone that likes to undercut your prices. Not everything in the game is
competitive, but a lot of it is.

    More like, "Thank God you can't see what I did, because I want to keep
doing it until it's no longer rewarding to me. Then, and only then, will I
tell you what I did and how I did it!"

    It sounds like they have the same motivation: they want the reward from
accomplishing task A. One person went out and figured out how to do task A
on his own. The second person declined to spend time learning the way the
first person did, and instead hopes to be handed the knowledge.
