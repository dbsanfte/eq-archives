I've been looking at all other MMorpgs in some interest, trying to see if
there is anything interesting to hold my time.  I don't think Neocron is it.
From what I have heard from others with some research, I found that they
have this chip imbedded in your head that if your remove to get faster exp
and use better items at lower levels, you are open to get PKed.  they also
have this system called soul light or something along those lines where you
have a sort of faction that goes up or down based on those you kill who have
less soul light than yours.  So if you PK a lower level player, they will
almost certainly have less soul light then you, so you gain.  Therefore
there is an incentive for higher levels to PK lower levels.  They made this
soul light to stop PKing, but essentially from what I read this adds
incentive to PK.  I'm sure if you look for info on this you will find info
similiar to what I'm saying here.  Some people may like the idea of PvP free
environment, but most don't.
