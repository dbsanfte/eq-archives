I've been a guild officer for two years, a leader for 1.3 years.  My guild
has about 50 active PEOPLE (as opposed to characters or even accounts), and
started as a 30+ guild.  We're a social guild that's raid capable (not at
all uber...though we're >< this close to being able to take Inny down
ourselves...so we're getting nearly respectable).  That's just background on
me.

Have a guild meeting.  Create a channel for it if you want, or just use
/guildsay.

Without assigning blame, tell them why the leaders left...they have a right
to know.  Right now is the time where everyone has to feel that they at
least feel comfortable that no secrets that involve them are being kept.

The bad news is that things will suck for at least a month.  You've GOT to
cheerfully wave goodbye to anyone who leaves (unless you never want them or
their friends back...which may be the case sometimes) and let them know
they're welcome back if they choose to.

You're going to lose quite a few people.  Hell, you might decide to quit the
guild yourself...that's an option if all else fails or people are being real
jerks about it.

But most important...MOST important...is that you have to step up to the
plate and LEAD.  You cannot be wishy-washy.  You have to keep a smiling face
ALL THE TIME even when you're hurting badly.  You MUST be an optimist.  BUT,
that doesn't mean you can't say "NO!" sometimes...in fact, you MUST.

...and you've got to have the strength to put people in their place who try
to co-lead (in tells...gotta be nice, but gotta be firm)...I'm sure you know
the type.  Strong personalities who don't think you're leading fast enough.
If they persist, suggest they will probably be happier in another guild.

And if all else fails, quit the guild and take your friends with you.
Create a new guild (or talk some other sucker into leading it...it's a
thankless job).  Yeah yeah, it's a guild...family...but it's still a game.
If you're playing a game that's giving you heartbreak over the long term
only says bad things about yourself (as in, you're stupid :) ).
