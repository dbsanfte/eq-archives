OTOH, LDoN as it is is already well on its way to becoming very
tedious.  Once you're familiar with the environment it is nearly
trivial to defeat "normal" dungeons so long as your group is
neither hopelessly disfunctional nor afflicted with an extreme
rash of LDs.  And if your group is reasonably skilled and
adequately geared (i.e. no melees wearing newbie quest armor in
their 50's) the dungeons are trivial.  All anybody cares about
is how fast you complete the dungeon, unless it's a collection
quest it is assumed that you will win handily (and so many folks
flat out refuse collections).  Pulling "skill" is judged strictly
by how fast you can feed the easily digestible mobs into your
group's killzone.  Mana shortages are nearly unheard of, deaths
are rare, wipes are rarer, wipes that lead to failure are rarer
still.  Or so it's been for Kaev the last two weeks in random
pickup groups.  There's no challenge, and my enthusiasm for the
expansion is fading rapidly.  The mobs and dungeons just don't
put up a significant struggle.  I've seen a grand total of two
Enchanter mobs, a couple of mini-boss SKs, and a buttload of
pathetic melee/druid/cleric mobs.  There are so few roamers that
you don't even consider them, once in a while you get an add,
whoopee.  Under 55 dungeons (group avg level < 57) are trivial
if you have one of Paladin/Necro/Cleric/Enchanter unless your
group is pathetic.  The mobs in dungeons the next step up (group
avg level > 58, dunno the exact crossover point) are often too
high for Paladin/Necro paci/mez, so if your gear isn't silly
you should bring a Cleric or Enchanter to make them equally
trivial.  (I dunno Bard lull/mez very well, but I wouldn't be
surprised to learn you could use a Bard as puller and/or CC in
any group, regardless of level.)

So, if it's all easy, why play?  The fancy costumes are wearing
thin, EQ looks more and more like a chatroom every day.  I mean,
given how easy LDoN is for random (and I do mean random) pickup
groups, it's a wonder raid geared players like Faned doesn't just
pull until the Healer is OOM and then increase the pace to try
to make it interesting.
