See, this was exactly like when Richard offered my baby Harnessing (that 
sick bastard!  She's not even of age yet!).  When you offered her PotG, 
she wasn't hitting anything or getting hit back.  Therefore, PotG would 
have been, well, kind of silly.  It would have made dark pact more 
efficient, yes, but then, that's what I've got harm touch for :D

Ryou
(is really enjoying starting out a fight at 8hp after healing her tank, 
and finishing with full health)
