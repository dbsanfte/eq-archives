To safely move around Befallen and retrieve a few corpses for people, I 
went into Sneak / Hide mode.  I would go get the corpse and drag it back 
safely, yet, slowly.

Unless I screw the sneak / hide up, will it ever drop on me?  Does it have 
a random chance of dropping?

What happen if I take falling damage, does it go away?

What if I am Lev'd and it drops, and I accelerate rapidly to the ground?  
Does it drop then?

Do I ever get to go faster when I Hide / Sneak?

So much to learn...

The Safehouse won't display properly on any of the browsers on my Mandrake 
8.0 box, so I can't browse that and read while I play.  Damn.
