Skill caps at 175 until level fifty. Then it starts going up again.
Simple math would make you think that at level 55 you could hit 201 and
bind to 70%, but I see a lot of bitching in warrior forums that the caps
per level are screwed up and don't come out to an even five per level.
Could just be a bad day on the RNG for them, of course.

I never bothered finishing maxing my bind wounds on my 55 warrior to
see. I suppose if I get REALLY bored some day I might, but that would
take a lot of boredom.

Currently my next plans for my warrior, sadly, are to serve as a
sacrifice to my wife's evil necro a couple times when she ding's 51 and
gets her "better than the cleric" ressurection spell.
