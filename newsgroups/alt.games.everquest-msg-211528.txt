When I hit the hotkey it says "casting camouflage" and I instantly go 
invis.  The icon in my buffs window says "Camouflage."  However, I have yet 
to see it fade.  This could be because I've been lucky, could be that it 
never fades.  Anybody know which it is?

And my second question: assuming it does have a duration and it does begin 
to fade while I'm in hostile territory, will re-casting it cause stuff to 
aggro, or is the insta-cast enough that I'm never visible?

For anybody hesitating to get it, stop hesitating.  It makes pulling 
anywhere that mobs don't see invis SO much better.
