Thank you all so much for your advice.  I will keep my char - which is the
answer I was really hoping for :)

I do group when I can but  I find it hard to find people who want to group
with a wizard or know how to group with a wizard (sorry if that sounds
precocious for a relative newbie).  Many don't seem to understand I can't
cast if I am being mobbed or allow time for me to med between pulls.  I'm
not complaining though - I really love EQ and love playing a wizard.

I have been part of some very effective groups but actually get more exp
solo-ing against larger single critters sometimes.  I had some great times
in Everfrost recently though, I teamed up with to Barbarian shamies to fight
Mammoth Calves and other critters that dwell there - lots of fun :)

Good hunting.

/thanks

Roz
