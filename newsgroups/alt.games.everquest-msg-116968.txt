Naw.. I disagree... there were 250 people in zone... lag like that is
to be expected...
Sure Id like to have a new cpu vid card... but not worth the expense
for just a very rare occasion when 250 plus are in a zone...  
and a small zone at that...
LoIO isnt laggy to me when 100 plus are in it..

but as all things its just my opinion and what I want to live with...
