Big game tonight, fifteen tables.  I arrive late because of work, but I
phoned ahead so they were aware of it.  Just as I arrive, my fill-in is
finishing declaring the first hand.

I sit down and try to focus.  The first few rounds go very well; we're
getting tops and average-pluses.

Then I get the following hand, red against white:

AQ9x
9x
JT9x
AQx

I open 1D, LHO overcalls 2H, weak.  Sam makes a negative double, and RHO
bids 4H.  I mentally shrug and bid 4S.  Sam bids 5H.  Too bad we don't play
exclusion Blackwood - perhaps we should - but this is still a very strong
indication of how much he likes his hand.  I decide to try 6S.

The opening lead is a small diamond.  How would you play it?

A8xx
KJT9x

AQx

My first thought:  AD, Spade to the A, heart ruff, club to the A, heart
ruff, KS, club to the Q, QS and last spade pitching two diamonds from the
dummy, run clubs conceding diamond in the end.  This works if the clubs and
spades are both 3-2, or 3-2 clubs and stiff JS, or 4-1 clubs and 3-2 spades
as long at the person with a stiff club is also short on spades.

Or I could play for split diamond honors.  The lead looks like a stiff, but
it may be a simple Qxx lead.  What are the chances that both clubs and
spades are 3-2 on the bidding?  Not good, I think.

Let's try to envision LHO's shape, I think to myself.  6-3-1-3?  I can make
it by ruffing hearts if she has that shape.  6-2-1-4?  Neither line works.
6-3-3-1?  Ruffing hearts won't work, but split honors might.  6-2-4-1?
Split diamond honors.  6-2-2-3?  Either line works if the diamond honors
split.  6-2-3-2?  Either line.

It looks about even - if the diamond honors are splitting.  If the spades
are 4-1, my best bet is split diamond honors - if I can pick up the spades.

What a headache.  I haven't even considered that LHO may have seven or five
hearts.

In the end, I decide that spades are likely to be 4-1, so play for split
diamond honors.  I play low from dummy and RHO wins the KD.  She pauses and
I hold my breath.  She switches to a low spade.  I play low and so does LHO.
I'm actually able to win the spade in hand with my X.  I consider if this
changes my plans, but it really doesn't - I'm in the same situation I was
before.  I ruff one heart and draw trump - they break 3-2.  I lead the JD,
and LHO shows out.

Dangit all to heck.

I win the AD and cash out for down one.  LHO, it turns out, was 6-2-1-4 with
the Jx of spades.  On the defense I got, the slam could have been made by
ruffing a heart, club to the A, ruffing a heart with the KS, then a spade
back to my hand to finish drawing trump.

Bah and double bah.  I console myself with the fact that if I'd chosen the
first line at trick one, I would have gone down.  Also, they could have set
me off the top with a diamond ruff at trick two.  Still, it doesn't help
much.  I was in a contract I could have made, but didn't.

A few rounds later I pick up this stellar bunch:

832
9845
9732
42

A true Yarborough.  Sam opens 2NT in first seat, pass.

Now I get clever.

"Well, this dummy will be useless to Sam.  We're quite likely to go down.
But, maybe, just maybe, I can improve the contract.  Yes, yes... I can bid
3C, regular Stayman, and pass Sam's response!  Brilliant!  We may play in a
4-3 fit, but we'll have a better chance of making that contract than 2NT.
What a smart guy you are, self."

So I bid 3C.  This gets doubled on my left and passed back to me.

My whole world has just come crashing down around me.  Sam's pass indicates
no four-card major and a tolerance for clubs.  What the heck can I do?  How
can I recover?  Redouble?  That would be to play.  3D?  Sam would take that
as forward-going.  3NT, when I could have passed 2NT?

In the end, I decide to pass for one reason: if anyone has to suffer through
actually playing the hand, it should be me.

Sam puts down the worst 20 points in the world:

KQJ
QJ
AQJx
KJxx

I somehow manage to escape for down four, 1100 and a stone-cold bottom.  My
clever bid had come back to haunt me with an extreme vengeance.  The bridge
gods are A) Vengeful; B) Merciless; C) Not without a sense of humor.

Sam and I leave without bothering to wait for the results.  I'm still
shaking my head at my own cleverness.  Next time I won't be so clever;
instead, I'll just play bridge.
