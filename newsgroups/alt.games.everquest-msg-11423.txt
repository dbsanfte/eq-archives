Do I believe people from one country are <better> or <worse> than those from
others? No. Do I believe people from one country differ to people from
others? Yes. Only a fool expects people to behave exactly the same from one
country to the next.

Far from changing horses I went on to explain possible reasons why they
differ in that particular context. That was where "brat kids" and
"economics" came into it.
