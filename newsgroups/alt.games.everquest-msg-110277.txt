I'm going to kind of jump into the middle of this thread with my 2cp

Being both a master smith AND a prospective buyer of tradeskill
products, I am of the opinion that if people will pay your asking
price rather than take the trouble to skill up and make it themselves,
then you're not charging too much. If you WERE charging too much, then
no one would buy it, and you wouldn't be bothering with it for long.
It's pretty simple. It's kind of silly to get into a Stanford Business
School-esque (no, I have no clue if they have a business school or
not) type debate on the topic - it would truly be a waste of that kind
of insight.

It's also ridiculous to think that just because one person charges
much more for an item they are selling than others do, that they are
ripping people off. Buyers should know what they are buying and
sellers should get what they can get. That person demanding 10pp each
for DF belts will give up and lower their price long before they ever
sell any.

They shouldn't. What, they're mad because someone won't sell them a
product for the price they want to pay? Pay it or don't pay it and
continue looking. Your choice.

Granted, I've never OWNED one, but I would think that increasing the
capacity of the pack by 25% and decreasing it's total weight by 10%
only serves to allow you to carry more for similar weight, not less.

I completely agree. Sell them for 200pp if people are willing to pay
it.

Next, we can talk about the fine plate whores... :)
