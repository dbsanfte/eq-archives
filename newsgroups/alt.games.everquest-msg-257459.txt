Could we get a description of Torment since it's a new hotspot.  I've got a 65 
bst, almost 62 cleric, and a 59 chanter that I 3 box with.  Would like to take 
advantage of Torment if it's possible.  What are the camp areas and what types 
of mobs are there?  I've never seen an exp group there in the few times I've 
poked my head in the zone.  Can any of the camps be fought at with my group or 
is a full group necessary?
