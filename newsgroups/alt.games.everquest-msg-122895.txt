Here's what worked for me in a similar situation.  Use /report to show
the person agreeing to the intended course of action prior to enacting
the transaction.  I.E., do a /report of them saying "yes" they'll do
it for you.  If they subsequently do not do what they agreed to do,
file a /petition referencing the /report as FRAUD. Fraud (falsely
representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's expense) is
categorized as ABUSE.  If the transaction goes off without a problem,
then simply go on with life.  I have never been contacted about a
/report that had no subsequent /petition referencing it.  I suspect
GM's discard unreferenced /reports after a period of time along the
lines of less work is better than more work ;).  Also, based on my
very limited understanding, I think /reports stay in the GM's queue
for a while, even if log to an alternate character (long enough to
resolve the matter at hand).  This might be an excessive step for
small ticket transfers, but this approach for large ticket items could
save you a lot of grief.

I had a troll on Rallos Zek who needed a bind in FP, but the person
agreeing to do it demanded payment up front, so I got a /report on him
agreeing to bind me for payment.  When he ran off without doing what
he promised, I petitioned to get my money back, stating fraud and
referenced the /report.  Watching the player skulk back under the
glare of a guide to return my money and THEN killing him (pvp don't ya
know...) and then killing him again...  made my day.

I think /report and forethought can be your friend in such "high
stakes" transfers.
