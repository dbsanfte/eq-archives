Actually, it's kind of fun.  I tried it out for several hours
on the first night.  It's really interesting how it changes
your longstanding EQ habits when you can't risk even a single
death.

And while it would indeed "suck and suck hard" if you were hoping
to max out your levels and so forth, the whole point is that
if that's what you're after, stay on a "normal" server.  *This*
server is for an entirely different kind of gaming experience
(and entirely new goals).  Go into it *knowing* that you'll
never make level 50 (or even close), and play with a different
attitude, and you'll find it refreshingly exhilarating.

The first thing to keep in mind is that eventually (probably
sooner rather than later), you *will* die and lose all your
progress.  (And even dying to a fall or a mob will reset
you to level 1 and lose all your skills/spells/etc., although
you can go back and loot your corpse unless you died to PvP
and your killer looted it first.)  So the real game is
just to see how long you can last.  And since you're likely
to "die young", you never lose very much anyway.

The second fun thing is to choose whether you want to
try to PvP a lot, or go sneak off to an unused corner of
Norrath and level up through mob-fighting while avoiding
other players -- which may be difficult because there's no
/roleplay or /anon.

Another dynamic is that whoever is the highest level
person on the server is going to inevitably be the target
of (temporarily) cooperating players forming "hit squads"
gunning for the "uber" player in order to prevent him from
outleveling everyone too much and becoming almost unbeatable.

So while it's true that you "lose everything" when you die
on the new server, it's also true that you won't ever have
much to lose, since *everyone* is going to be slaughtered
frequently.  The real challenge is to see how long you can
make any particular incarnation of your character last, and
how high anyone can manage to get a character before they
are felled (no higher than the teens, most likely, if even
that).

Another fun thing about the server is that you regain that
long-lost feeling of being very proud of dinging level 4
or whatever, heh.  Plus you wrack your brain thinking of ways
to apply your years of uber-experience in the game to a
new situation, and using only the tools available to a lowbie,
which I find fun as well.

I'm certainly not going to spend all my time on The Fallen,
but it's a fun place to go for a major change of pace.
