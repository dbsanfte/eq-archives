Well, any normal person would have been offended by the title.  Your claim
that you were ignorant of the tone of your message doesn't carry much weight
since you decided to post it under a totally new handle than the one we're
familiar with, namely BONDA170.  Now there might have been another reason
for this, but from my POV it seems like you were trolling and decided to
back up when you found almost unanimous derision.
