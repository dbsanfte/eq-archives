Both.

Nothing worse than having your connection go down on your day off and not 
being able to play.  Well, there are probably worse things.

Right now I've got AT&T cable modem and SBC DSL run through a Linux box w/ 
ip masq.  Both are about the same price.  Cable modem is about 3-4x as fast 
as the DSL on the downstream, but I find it less stable.  In general I 
leave my default route set to the cable, with stuff where I care more about 
having the link up at all, but not so much the speed (such as email, ssh 
sessions, EQ) routed through the DSL.  EQ really isn't bandwidth intense 
(except maybe when you zone); it's more about your ISP's peering and 
routing stability.
