    Buddy's High Priest is almost at "best horse" level plat in the bank.
It's all about winning rolls on items, and getting upgrades on guild raids
so you can sell the old stuff. He's abandoned his twinks, so he keeps cash
well. And when you always get something saleable (he alternates between
Frenzied in Velk's and Upper Dogs in Velk's, stays a long time so he wins a
drop) when you play it adds up quickly. He also did NOT pay for his 55 plus
spells - those were given to him by the guild.
