First take the time to read the End User License Agreement that you agree to
every time you plat Everquest. Next to transfer characters from 1 account to
another you have to be the Original Registered Owner of both accounts. My
suggestion is to buy a second computer, and a router thenyou can enjoy being
an EBayer
