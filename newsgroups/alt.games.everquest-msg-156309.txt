Rodcet nife, 60 k again, different seller today. Phase spider carapace,
briefly 12k last night (woo! almost affordable), now 14. Ironically, the
lower forms of monk armor (eg wu's) can't be sold for cost price and i just
sell it to vendor (was tradeskilling) but i could sell crystalline silk,
which is pretty worthless gear as far as i can see ... no idea why it's
sold, and always below cost price anyway.

I think acrylia armor might be the only monk armor that's tradeskillable and
profitable?
