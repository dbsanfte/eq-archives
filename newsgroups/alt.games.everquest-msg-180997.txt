I'm usually the only in in the zone so there's not alot of point. EC and WC
were pretty much destroyed by luclin; everyone seems to got to PC and bitch
at each other now.

I am killing gix because a) faction b) I hate gix. He killed my mother and
my father and he deserves to die. A lot. Hill giants pass the time between
killing gixii.

Besides, the dragoon is pointless as far as I can see (no loot, no xp, no
useful factions, nothing but an oversized mosquito really) and if people
don't like him, why not harass the game designers to get rid of him? He adds
nothing to the game and makes absolutely no sense. He does heaps of damage
with a rusty weapon, carries silver, says nothing interesting, and is
ignored by the "good" people there. You'd think the druids would take out a
shadowknight!
