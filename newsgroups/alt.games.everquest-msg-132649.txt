What about when the speed of the weapons is nearly the same?
My 45 ranger is currently wielding a Centi LS 14/27 and a
Centi SS 12/25 combination.  My damage bonus with either is
6.  Thus if I put the LS in the primary slot, effectively
I have a 20/27 in primary and a 12/25 in secondary.  When
I have the SS in primary it's 18/25 primary 14/27 secondary.
All skills are maxed at cap including Dual Wield.

I have been using the SS in primary most of the time as I
(very subjectively) seem to do more damage this way.  But
every so often I meet an "expert" in game who claims the
other way is the proper way.  Of course then I'm sure to
meet someone else an hour later who swears the reverse is
true.

Copeland's Weapon Analyzer v1.81 gives exactly the same
damage/minute (683) with either combo.
