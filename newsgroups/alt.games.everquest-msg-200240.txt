They do, for the same reason a warrior will outdamge a knight with the same
weapons...   While they are on the same table, they are at very different
places on the table.     The difference is all in your ATK rating.

This was a few months ago, but I compared my warrior's ATK rating to a
similarly equipped paladin, and a slightly less well equipped ranger.

(this was at level 60 before PoP, IIRC)
Paladin ATK 1050   (due to lower weapon skill.  Paladins can't get up to 250
as warriors and rangers can.)
Warrrior ATK 1150
Ranger ATK 1400

Rangers have some very serious attack buffs, some of which are group, and
some of which are self only.   They also have some spells to add damage
procs to thier weapons, for additional melee damage.

I had parsed my damage after a weapon upgrade.   Even though I now had
superior weapons over the Ranger, he was doing the same level of damage per
second in melee combat.

They are putting out more damage.   It's also the way that they put it out.
Procs have more aggro attached to them than a melee hit for the same damage.
