    Most of the disagreements here are based on level of player talking.
Jakugg in high 20's, and Dan's ENCH is 49 plus.

    The ENCH level 4 AoE stun is fast enough to cast to be castable between
mob swings. By the time you're level 20, you can fire level 4 stun, Tash,
level 20 stun, mez without being interrupted. That's how Dan is able to do
it - his spells cast very quickly.

    Dan also plays at a level where he frequently has a shammy casting
Togor's or Turgur's on everything. If ever there was a spell that nerfs a
mob, it's Turgur's. By top level it's a 70? 75? percent slowdown. The mob
will frequently just stand there, looking at you, for some time before
taking a swing. Plenty of time to get off spells on it. Heck, with Turgur's
I can usually sit, swap spells, and get up before the next swing.

    Note also that all the things that Dan's ENCH are doing to the mob, or
trying to do, get it far angrier than a few swings and a taunt from a
warrior. It can take you some time to swing the mob around, during which
time the primary mob is beating on someone that ISN'T the warrior, and the
secondary mob is tearing the now-mezless ENCH a new one (unless ENCH is
chain-stunning to save his own life, and then you'll never beat his hate).

    In groups without an ENCH, this is exactly what one does. Because there
is no reliable way to get the mobs off the robes. With an ENCH, the game
changes - he can stop it COLD.

    One other thing you may be seeing. You said you were in High Keep,
correct? The goblins, at the level you fight them, are typically red to
yellow. That may have been giving the ENCH trouble landing *any* spells.
Although why you didn't have the rooms well-broken is beyond me. ;-)

    Tee hee. What Dan should have said is that warriors don't have to think
much to do their job effectively. Assist, and mob placement (facing,
position in room) are about it. Oh, and holding bashes when on effective
casters.

    By higher levels, you will be so wrong it will cost you groups if you
attempt to "get it off the ENCH".

    This is "standard procedure", if you will:

Scenario (A) A pull of X mobs, one non-tanked mob stays awake after ENCH
mezzes.
ENCH usually tries to re-apply mez, gets horribly interrupted.
ENCH casts AoE stun while cleric casts Remedy or Divine Light on ENCH.
AoE stun lands, ENCH starts casting Mez, cleric casts Stun on target mob to
extend the stun time about a second or two after the AoE stun.
Mob goes beddy-bye. If the mez fails, then CLR should drop a Holy Might on
the mob NOW, before the mez starts casting, then stand right beside the mob
so it'll hit the CLR when it wakes up. ENCH will land a mez shortly. If
tanks are being hit hard, CLR can usually channel an intermediate Celestial
Light onto the tank through the target's pounding.
If AoE stuns are being resisted, I usually (as CLR) keep on chain-healing,
and move to be closer to the mob than the ENCH to pull it off him. Only the
ENCH can save us.

Scenario (B) A pull of X mobs, two plus mobs stay awake.
ENCH starts chain-stunning and mezzing like a madman. CLR chain-heals ENCH,
sometimes pauses to heal self as mobs start to move from ENCH to CLR.
Evaccer gets nervous. ;-) If a tank were switching targets, then all the
mobs would stay awake and evac would have to happen.

    I usually don't have to heal myself. Either an off-healer (DRU, SHM)
does it, or I just sit and let the group Regen from the DRU take care of it.
If I got whalloped good, then I Celestial Heal myself to keep aggro low.

    Heh, as if. The ENCH likely took out a few mezzing, and as soon as I
started healing the rest beelined me. ;-)

>He looks like a big
>strong fellow! He can *easily* job back here naked with the rest of us
>if the cleric goes near OOM and he's down to fifty hit points."

    Again, a high-level thing: if you're low on life, I can cast one spell
(Complete Heal) and you're back at full. And it doesn't take much mana as a
fraction of my bar. Tanks are easy to heal - they live long. Crunchy ENCHs
don't, especially ones that don't believe in solid gear like Electrum Black
Sapphire Earrings and Velium Fire Wedding rings.

    Note that once the ENCH has everything sleeping, they can also help you
live until the cleric has mana for heals:
1) Chain-stunning the awake mob.
2) Chain-casting Berserker STR or Rune on you (these spells have damage
absorption)
3) Casting a slowdown spell on the active mob.
4) (Emergency) Mez the active mob, and keep everything asleep until the
healer has his stuff together.

    Sad thing is, they should be. The ENCH knows which one is going to wake
up next, and whether that or using one as a mana battery is more important.
Or whether one has to be GoK'ed. Or whether.... you get the picture.

     Tank usually calls what he's on when pulling. This means the ENCH
doesn't waste time assisting the main tank, then switching to off mobs when
finding targets - he knows what the first victim is as it's being pulled.

    Sigh, it's so true. Tanks don't have a mana bar, so they think if
they're full health it's time to BARSH! It's also too easy to be a tank
without any brains. I spent one time in Fungi King stunning the mobs into
the corner myself with Sound of Force because the warrior just couldn't get
into her thick head how to bash a mob into the corner. Once I stunned it
past her, she did it automatically by turning around to engage the mob. ;-)

>I'll try to remember that when three red mobs

    At Dan's level, three red mobs can mean a total party wipeout regardless
of what you do.

>wailing on your little A/C 50 butt

    I'll have you know that at high levels an ENCH can get AC up to 750, a
level that can best be described as "not enough". ;-)

>"Duh...... bud da chanter sed I shud jus keep bashin' dis one! Wut? He

    And as mentioned above, enchanters are crunchy. ;-)

    To summarize: on the weekend, an ENCH in our group said, "Hitting mezzed
mobs makes baby Jesus cry." This could mean one of three things:

1) The ENCH was woozy from being hit by all the newly-woken mobs and didn't
know what he was saying.
2) The ENCH was trying to be spiritual to suck up to the cleric, but since
ENCHs are all Agnostic he didn't quite get it right.
3) The ENCH had a god complex.

    I imagine it was a combination of the three.
