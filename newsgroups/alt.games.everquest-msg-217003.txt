I always find it hard to understand why healers aren't watching the
action as well as people's hitpoint bars in fights. Now there's no spell
book it's not that hard to make sure your facing the action and watching
what's happening, even if you're sitting medding. If I'm not needing to
heal someone right away, I'm usually assisting mobs to see who they're
beating on, especially during initial engages when debuff agro pulls the
mob off the mt onto someone else. 

As far as canni5 goes, I encourage any shaman using it to make a hotkey
and look up the /alt activate number for canni 5. There should be lists
around, in fact, I just googled for it and canni 5 is /alt activate 47
