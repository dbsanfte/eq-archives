Now we're getting somewhere.

If you saw this person doing something that you didn't know how to do, what
would be the most reasonable course of action?

1) A) Log out of the game  B) Find a fansite with old patch messages C) Read
every patch message you might have missed for a description of how to do the
action you just saw performed.


2) A) Type "Nice.  How did you do that?"
