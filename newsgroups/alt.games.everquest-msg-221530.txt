Thanks for reading... (This is a bit long but I think that there are
many EQ players who are in the same quagmire I find myself)

First off, I have been playing EQ since late August 2003. My sole
character is located on the Stromm server- a level 39 human ranger.

I chose the newbee server because I am just that; I had always wanted
to play EQ but had neither an adequate system nor stable internet
connection. With the assembly of my dream (well, near dream) system
and installation of a cable modem, I purchased Plains of Power and
logged onto (into?) Norrath.

At first, I did everthing by the book: I hunted in Qeynos Hills and
eventually moved into the intermediate training area, Blackburrow
Hollow; I began training and using skills such as sense-heading and
tracking; I began to learn how to group and see how I best fit into
such groups. I eventually finished my newbee armor quest and even the
sword that went with it. Everything was going pretty well.

At this point, I had my first quest armor and sword, and had reached a
level of probably just over 10. I had also not explored much, keeping
primarily close to home; the furthest I had travelled was to North
Qeynos and West Karana. This is where I think I stumbled.

I wasn't too crazy about just going into POK and travelling to another
city or land, I wanted to travel to it- by ship or foot, I wanted to
get the immersive feel of EQ. I made it to Highpass Hold and High Keep
and eventually to Freeport.

I didn't really know where to go or which quests to begin, so I took
some time and mastered my baking and smithing skills, making a bit of
cash and experiencing more than just killing mobs. Unfortunately,
after taking a few days to work on tradeskills, I came across some
people I remembered from my early days of EQ- they were 10-15 levels
above me. I still wasn't sure what to quest for or where to go, so I
decided to powerlevell until I figured out what to do. My first
mistake.

I powerlevelled in Crushbone until I was 20 and then in High Keep
until my mid-20s. I then upgraded to to Evolutions and found the
Bazaar. My savings disappeared and I had lovely armor and weapons (all
lore... none of it quested, just bought.) I tried a guild but found
only people who were powerlevelling... I soon dumped the guild.
Indecisive about what to do, I returned to High Keep and pushed myself
nearly to 40.

And now, at level 39, I have barely been anywhere and quested next to
nothing. I have gear that is worth thousands and would make level 55
people slobber. I have no idea where to go or what to quest.

I've created a rut and can't find a way out... any ideas?
