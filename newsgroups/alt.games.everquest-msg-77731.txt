graphics do not excite me... i don't play games coz they are exciting to
"watch" - i play games because the are exciting to play...

the way the snow feels depends on the controls work and how they are
interpreted in the game, not how it looks...


graphics does not matter - gameplay matters...


and btw - although the idea in GTA 1/2 and GTA 3 are the same, the
gameplay is quite different, in one you have to master overhead driving
and in the other you have to master 1st person perspective driving -
although the goal are the same, the way it plays is different -
therefore the gameplay is different...
