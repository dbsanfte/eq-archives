I use the Radeon 32 ddr (great board) I have found it to be very stable with
my win 98 se system.
I would make sure you have the latest drivers,

Also make sure you have the latest direct x8 installed also.
You can try running "dxdiag" to see if its working as it should, select run
from the start menu and type "dxdiag". try the diagnostics.
