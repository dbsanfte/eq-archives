AFAIK if you've made your toon into a PK by handing over the book to the
priest of discord then you can't have any beneficial spells cast on you by
none PK type players ... of course KEI would come under the beneficial type
of spell :)

I don't know of any way to return from the PK side of the world ... maybe
you could petition a GM? ... I hope there's a way back as your toon must be
46+ to be able to have KEI cast on them ... if there's no way back then your
toon is pretty much ruined as you won't be able to have any buffs etc. cast
on you while grouping or raiding  apart from your own  ... I'd start
preparing yourself for a life of soloing with that toon :-(
