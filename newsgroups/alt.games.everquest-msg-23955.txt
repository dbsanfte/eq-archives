Your memory served you well.
I actually tried to find the sequels by looking for Wizard's 2nd and 3rd
Rule, but obviously never found them. A bundled set on Amazon showed me the
other ones were named differently :)

Nice reads though. Just think of a Paladin starting out by getting his Fiery
Defender and then figuring out what to do with it :)
