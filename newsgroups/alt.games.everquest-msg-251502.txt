Just to show you the difference between accurate information and bogus
information, I called three firearm dealers in my area and the all have
return policies, some longer than others but each offer a full mony back
guarentee even if the fire arm has been discharged no questions asked.  I
did a search on the internet for firearm return policies and found the same.
So I can only conclude that your statement that your would not beable to
return a .45 Cal firearm is just your own surmising.

Regarding the calculation of damage/delay raitions to determine there is
alot of differing opinions about this on many of the web sites that offer
such information.  The value of actualy seeing the weapons performance
outweighs peoples surmising by a long shot.  I have calculated the dps of a
weapon using the advice of various web sites only to find that when I
acutaly used the weapon the performance was different from what i was
calculated to be.  There is alot of missinformation out there just like your
statement that you couldnt return a .45 Cal firearm.  Thats why people rely
on such things a Consumer Reports, and actual Research them selves than the
bum advice of people like you.
