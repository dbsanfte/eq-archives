> Does the haste on haste items stack?

Which brings to mind a new "duh" question for me, playing my first
warrior...

Why in the hell would they put a haste affect on a 2h weapon?  Wouldn't it
make a lot more sense to just adjust the delay and drop the affect
altogether?

After hunting with hundreds of barb, troll and ogre warriors I got tired of
it, so I created a gnome warrior, total twink/fun character.  I did all the
crafted quests before he even hit level 2.  Now he's 19 with 11 hours
/play'd and 1hs/2hs are near maxed (have ignored blunt so far).  I'm
thinking 550AC at level 19 isn't too bad, but I'm always looking out for
better stuff that a broke (5k total between all chars) can afford or acquire
for my little fighter.  He's a lot of fun, despite his obvious disadvantages
(STR/STA, height...trying to get around others).

But I'm rambling.  Haven't gotten him his first haste item yet...haven't
gotten around to figuring out what's easily available to a 52 druid/56 enc
"soloing" expedition (FBSS doesn't count, trying to find the damned camp
open + actually camping for hours isn't my idea of fun and lord knows I
can't afford to buy one for a twink).
