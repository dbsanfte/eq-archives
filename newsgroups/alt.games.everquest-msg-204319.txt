And I would argue it's a strength. It lets new players more quickly
catch up to the level of play the game is now at. Watching a truly
new player try to game in sucky gear (read L50 warrior in crafted)
is painful. 

Sure, level limits and no-drop to limit the stupidly uber stuff
from having wide distribution.

I've also never seen this as an issue. Some guy got a good
price on some excellent gear in the bazaar? I can get good prices
on some excellent gear in the bazaar? Great for both of us.
