: The normal damage that a weapon will do most frequently is dmg x 2 + 1.

: the same as for non melee classes dmg x 2 + 1.

This is close to correct.

There are 3 equations for damage, Min, MODE ( what you hit for the most
often, about 1/3 the time), and MAX

here are the equations

Min = 1+Damage Bonus
MODE = (2*Damage)+Damage Bonus
MAX = ((skill+STR)/100)*damage+Damage Bonus

You can find what the damage bonus will be at diferent levels here
http://lucy.fnord.net/dmgbonus.html

Against an blue or lower mob, if you charted your hits they would roughly be
spred out 1/3 from min to mode, 1/3 mode, and 1/3 mode to max.  You may
never actualy hit for your max, or your min.  I use Yalp (
http://www.yalp.org/ ) to parse my damage over the corse of a day, or just a
fight. I normaly split my log if I DING or change weapons. One log that
covered 1 1/2 weeks showed my lowest hit for 5, when my real min is 3, and
my max at 156, when my real max should have been around 160 with buffs.

Hope you find this info valuable.
