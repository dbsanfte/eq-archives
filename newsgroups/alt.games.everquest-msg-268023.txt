From what I understand (and I may be wrong) there are ratial traits, but they
are gained as you level.   At 18, I believe, all characters get to choose
between 2 racial tradeskill advantages.  (Different options for each race).
And at 40?ish you get to choose another racial trait, like Iksar Regeneration.
I don't think I've seen a complete list of the racial traits, so I can't say
how they compare to the EQ1 advantages.

Correct.

Some skills and abilities carry over, others do not.   Monks still get feign
death, and rogues can still evade and sneak / hide (although they are
implemented differently).   Harm touch and Lay Hands did not make the cut, to
my knowledge.

Tradeskill classes are in addition to your combat class, not instead of your
combat class.   You have two separate experience bars, one for Combat
experience and one for Crafting experience.

Each player picks a combat class and an artisian class, independently of each
other.  Crafting has its own class tree to choose from, resulting in 9
subclasses.

You can level up your tradeskill level by crafting only, but it does not raise
your combat level.    I'm not sure whether having crafting levels exceed your
combat levels grants higher hit points or not.   With all the quests I've been
running, even without much killing my "normal exp" level has outpaced my craft
one.

Could a character only do tradeskills?   You could, but it's not really a
realistic option.  Aggro range is generally pretty low, and sprint will save
you (especially if you run early)... but you have to travel some dangerous
lands to harvest the tradeskill nodes.  What I'm saying is if you were willing
to run often and fast every time you got aggro, you could probably do it...
but running that often (and sometimes dying anyways) would get old _real_
fast.

Close, but not quite as dangerous.  It's very rare to be working on the forge
and have the loom add and kill you.
