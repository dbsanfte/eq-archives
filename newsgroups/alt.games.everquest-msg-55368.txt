    It's not a title, but it is a phrase - "Heart of Eagles". If he had the
last name "Heartofeagles", it would be taken away. But the last name
"Eagleheart" is OK. French doesn't really have a way of making the second
name, just the first. It is an anglocentric policy, but it's VI's sandbox.
Doing literal translations, then deciding if the literal is against the name
policy, is about as good a job as can be done given the GMs usually have to
be told when a non-English name has some other meaning.

    Actually, the literal translation - "Heart of Eagles" - is not a
compound word. It is not VI's problem that French just doesn't make compound
words well. And it's bad enough they usually have to rely on others telling
them what the literal translations are - it would be a disaster if folks
also got to tell them what those phrases really meant, and how they should
be read.
