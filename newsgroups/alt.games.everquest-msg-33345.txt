I noticed what Morelyn said in response to this post.  I don't know if it's
because of those same changes, or because of your foraging skill being
higher than it was before the path a couple months ago.

Except when I'm "low on food" or drink, and I keep foraging the opposite
thing I LIKE the change.  It's a lot nicer to forage 5 rabit parts in a row
than it is to forage a rabbit part, veggie, berry, fruit and grub.
