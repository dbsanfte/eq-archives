Yes, I imagine so as well.  But going to look for Breeze doesn't
make sense, not because its a much smaller amount of mana regen,
but rather because the duration is massively shorter.  A buff
that lasts two to four hours is worth getting, a buff that lasts
so little time that you probably won't make it to your camping
zone before its gone isn't; Breeze et al are only really viable
buffs if the enchanter is grouped with you... and they are great
buffs then.
