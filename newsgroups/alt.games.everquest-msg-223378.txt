It usually takes me no more then 2 minutes tops to convince the group
to take anything but collect, a minute later we're on our way.

Nope.

See above.

55 to 75 minutes is realistic for the groups I get.  And a little more
that half the time we keep killing after success, either hunting down
minis or just going for XP (recent slaughter in Tak we raced to clear
the observatory after the mission ended, dropped the last mob at the
top of the stairs 10 seconds before the dungeon poofed, great fun).

The AP rewards are part of the deal too, delaying success reduces the
rate at which you get them.  I'll go along with turning down rescues
if the group is unusually weak on DPS, but that's rare.  I'm not high
enough level yet to face honestly tough assassinate bosses, so I get
irritated (and letit show) if a group turns down an assassinate.  I
don't have experience of 30 minute wait for a mission (the one 20
minute wait I've endured is why I always push to take assassinate and
usually rescue).  Pickup groups vary a lot in quality, I've had a
group that took a rescue on my recommendation and then told me "it's
all on you" as we were about to zone in, because they had no experience
of succeeding at any mission except slaughter (we won handily).  A lot
of people don't have maps, and quite a few of them have been on multiple
missions that failed because the leader or puller or MT was clueless.
Of course, I have gotten to enjoy joining _any_ group that asks me (I'll
be picky if several ask at same time) and going ahead and succeeding
anyway.  I just treat beating a dungeon with a group full of the sort of
player names that used to send me looking for another zone to XP in as
a challenge.  One advantage to the LDoN pace, I can pull fast enough
that the d00d-wannabes have little spare time to foul my groupchat
window, and they thank me for it afterwards.  ;)

Again, my groups don't wait around for more than a couple minutes, and
that only when we get a string of collects offerred.  And, extra killing
after success occurs more often than not.
