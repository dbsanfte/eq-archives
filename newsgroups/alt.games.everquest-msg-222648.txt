*rub chin* You could be right.  The person who told me that someone is
slowly releasing shark money into the economy is also someone who tried to
buy Funeral Pyre from me for 27k when he was selling a copy for 35k the
other day. O_o  Ooookaay.

Personally I don't jack my prices, but I'm also hesitant to try to be the
force that lowers them becuase 1) maybe a price is legit and I"m just
being the asshat under-cutter and 2) if I set prices low, a reseller will
just end up buying it. :(

Name?  I find I often end up chatting with other 65 rangers just because
of common ground, so being warned of the wankers in advance is always
nice.  You can send me a private email (remove the obvious stuff from my
email) if you don't like to spread names over public channel.
