yeah here is what I've done before when I bothered to port people.

1) say "sorry "donation" is meaningless to me since I'm not a
charitable institution of any sort, please state what you are paying
me for the service."

2) say "you know I can port, but I don't know you have that money to
pay me so pay it now and I'll port you."  If they balk at that and say
"I pay after port!" I get up without saying nothing and leave. 9 times
out of 10 if they really have the money and want the port they go "OK
COME BACK!"

I let them know that the one doing the favor is me, not them paying me
pocket change. Even if they pay me 500 plat its still me doing them a
favor.
