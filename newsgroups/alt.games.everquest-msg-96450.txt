I've always marveled at the rigidity of how people thing they should play.
Determining that some class cannot tank or solo. You cannot go into some
dungeon if you don't have a chanter?
This all stems, as far as I can tell, from the need to level as efficiently
as possible. The race for lvl60 is on.
No no, we can't have you in the group, your total dmg output per square inch
does not equal the sum of both oposing sides multiplied by the number of
mobs currently in range, and you don't go with the drapes to well either.
Sorry mate, you're a <insert class here>, the dmg you do is of lesser
quality than the dmg we do, and your plat is no good here either.

Funny really that people rush so far beside the point of the game so
quickly, yet insist on being all about role playing and fantasy. EQ isn't a
game of math, it's a game of boundless adventure (yes a lawsuit is pending
as we speak). If you want to call yourself Legolas, be my guest (well not
really, I'll petition you anyway), but play the guy like Legolas. You don't
see him going around with a calculator worrying about exp modifiers and if
the area is suitable for his level.

My ranger is not a mathmatician. He's a ranger. He goes out and carves a
living from the lands. Sure he hunts to gain levels but he does so in a
rangerlike fashion. Wearing armor that crosses his path, be it looted
quested or bought. And being a ranger, I try to avoid groups. Not only does
the group dynamic baffle me (you're saying I'm not supposed to kill that
orc? Because frank over there is the main tank and I'm stealing his agro? I
thought we were in the same group) but I simply don't want to share the exp.
But in a group you can get more exp faster.
Ahh, would that involve that dreaded word 'efficiency' again? Thought so

I've forgotten the point to this post, so it probably got across.
