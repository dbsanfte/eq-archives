[d] Individuals who use ad hominem attacks shouldn't whine like 
     a stuffed pig when they're thrown back at them.

What the hell are you drooling about ? Exactly what was I not aware of ?

Unbelievable.

Because it's not the job of the courts in a democracy to set public
policy, impose and institute social change. It's the right and 
responsibility of the people through their elected officials. 

Because you are apparently getting your way with regards to the 
same sex marriage issue, you're gushing like a giddy school girl,
all lovey dovey for the process of judges usurping the rights of elected
officials from coast to coast to coast. But I'd order in another set of
panties if I were you, because he who lives by the sword will die by 
the sword, and another government down the road just might start 
replacing the liberal appointed hacks on the bench with ones which
more accurately reflect the Canadian population. And you'll be the 
first one to scream bloody murder about how unfair it is.
