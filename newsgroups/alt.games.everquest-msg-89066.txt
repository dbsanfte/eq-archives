My sympathies that your first Naggy raid happened to be with an idiot
for a raid leader. But given the nature of Naggy raids (usually p/u raid
forces) that really can't be avoided.

Here's a rule of thumb for you for the future: One Dragon + *ONE* Cleric
= One Smart Monk Who FD Flops His Way Out of the Zone to Go Hunt
Elsewhere.

40 people is way more than enough in sheer numbers, (we've done it with
as few as 28, others have with less) but the strategy and tactics and
class balance have to be there. Naggy can toast sixty *idiots* while a
couple dozen skilled players can make him trivial.

I won't even go into the laundry list of things that were done wrong on
that raid from your description, but there are some excellent Naggy
strategy guides out there on the web if you search. Check them out. Very
informative.

I would guess I did Naggy about a dozen times until I was finally too
high to go in his lair, and I have the red scales as a momento of my
days with him. He's usually everybody's first dragon, and it's something
you remember for a long time. :-)
