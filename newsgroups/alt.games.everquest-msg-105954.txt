It's possibly Fine Plate armor (made by blacksmiths) which has
been dyed green.  For any given color, armor can be dyed three
different shades, so it would be possible to almost (but not
quite) match the color of SS armor.

The Bard probably had some SS armor pieces, and wanted to try
to have the rest of the armor "match" for the sake of
appearance.
