I'm a bit boggled, I have and have used the CHDS+CHoS combo, GBoS+CHSD,
and really have a difficult time parsing out any "noticeable" agro
generation difference vs my usual setup of the Horror Shard Claw + GBoS.
Dex is capped with shaman buffage also.  I can't say that I can get
agro off of a snap-slow from a shaman until maybe 11+ swings or 3 or more
taunt mashings.  Having a pally there usually just takes 1 stun cast.
