The only one I've found that gives any xp worth a damn at level 30 is
doing crafted armour quests - you should get about 1/2 a yellow bubble
for questing a piece of crafted. Its not worth roaming all over to do,
unless you actually want that piece of armour (well, you *are* a
warrior, after all), but if you happen to get a quest drop because
you've just killed an aviak avocet, or a griffon, or whatever, you may
as well hand it in. Does require expensive gems though, and you might
have to hold out for a buyer for the end result who will give you enough
cash to even cover the gem cost...
