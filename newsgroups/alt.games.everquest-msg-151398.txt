It also works that way when you loot while soloing, and yes, it is new.

Actually, unless they changed it in the last couple of patches, when you
view a link, you can use that view to make a new link.  So, on a raid, the
looter, or someone in the looter's group, can click on the link on the loot
message, and use that view to make a link for the raid channel.  No need to
look around in your bags.
