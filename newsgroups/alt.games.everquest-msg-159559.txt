Hey I play on Bristlebane Server and for Halloween this year there was the
Standard GM event thats run without a GM in WC with Werewolves wasnt too bad
really except all the lag and Hi Levels KS everything But No Other Events
Anywhere..Years Past they used to patch a few Zones Dracolich in Rathe, Undead
Armies in Qeynos Hills now its like they put out last expansion and could care
less what does everyone think and I checked around on other servers there were
more things going on on other servers then on bristlebane where are our GMs ?
I guess they feel if they ignore us we all will goto EQ2?
