I have seen this happen and can confirm it -- if I lull a critter and
then charm it, the Pacification icon stays in the pet buff window for
five minutes.  If I cast it on myself, it only lasts 42 seconds.

I only have SCR1 and supposedly it's people with SCR2 and higher for
whom it works normally.  I'd been avoiding getting any more SCR points
just in case...  (I'm not sure if it's tied to the number of SCR points
specifically or total extension percentage.)
