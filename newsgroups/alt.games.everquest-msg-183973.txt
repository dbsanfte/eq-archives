I used to do that for SOW, so it wasn't extreme, since I only had to get a
Shaman to 9. :-)  I had a level 9 Iksar Shaman who spent his days sitting on
the hill near the Wizard port in Nektulos.  Whenever my Wizard's SOW ran
out, the Wizard would port to Nektulos, get it renewed (and get the rest of
the buffs a level 9 Shaman has), and then gate back to where he was
hunting.

Before gating back, if I was low on mana, I'd med in Nektulos, while
the Shaman and Wizard taught each other Iksar and Dark Elvish, so I guess
the Shaman was also my language mule. :-)

> 4. Be the first to 65 with a new class/race

A famous example of this was FoH's level 60 Ranger, something like a week
after Kunark.  The high level Rangers and Verant disagreed on whether the
new Kunark skill caps would make enough difference to fix the problems
Rangers had pre-Kunark.  Verant was taking a "until you reach those skill
caps, you don't know what the effect will be, so we don't want to talk about
it" attitude, so FoH spent a week getting a Ranger to the new caps.
