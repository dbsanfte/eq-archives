Of the two names I got, both were unguilded (a monk and rogue
unguilded at 56+ and 60?) last time I'd gotten them on /who... and
while I have never dealt with the monk, the rogue has been on my
shitlist ever since I ran into him in Dreadlands when he was level 39
and he gave me the impression he was an obnoxious twit. I can well
believe his account was soulmarked for an earlier offense.

I take it you know Mirrim? (She's so cool)
And yes, it seems the bard is blowing what *was* a certain thing for
him by getting his panties in a bunch and lying to 'further his case'.

BTW, what you doing snooping around our boards? : )

Another side note: one of our clerics got Zordakalicus late last
night/early this morning.

Heh. I'll need to go there again at least once to get corrupted
seahorse, but I'd have to go there at least half a dozen times before
I'd have a chance at getting around without someone to hold my hand
and tell me where to go. 
One of our shadow knights has had several unfortunate mishaps there
and has sworn off KK forever.
