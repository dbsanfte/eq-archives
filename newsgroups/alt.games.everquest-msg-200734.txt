SoE does not state that it is incompatible, just that it is not supported.  
Many have posted here that they run DX9 with no trouble at all on a variety 
of OSes, including XP.  Personally, I still use DX8.1, as I have had no 
compelling reason to upgrade.  I did recently upgrade to 1gig of memory, 
and had no problems with EQ as a result.
