If you accept a mission but decide to not EVER enter the dungeon and 
just log, abort, /q, whatever...does that count as a failed mission ? I 
ask this because a friend came on last night and we had just accepted 
the mission and were waiting outside the dugeon medding up and I wanted 
to abort and get a new mission with him in our group. We didn't because 
we were thinking it would count as a "failure".
