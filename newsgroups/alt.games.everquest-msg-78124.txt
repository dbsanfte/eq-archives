I would recommend Zone Alarm from www.zonelabs.com

It will ask for your permission for any program to access the internet and
will also block others from accessing your machine...
However I don't think EQ will work while it is running (since EQ uses some
UDP ports or something, I know nothing about this) so I just close ZoneAlarm
whenever I play, and then start it back up when I log off.
