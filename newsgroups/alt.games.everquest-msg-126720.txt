Depends on your typing speed. Would only take me 4 maybe 5 more
seconds to type that... Ultimately trivial.

That time is totally irrelevant because it has become a different
discussion when you chose to waste your time arguing with me over
"something like this".

Something I'd like to point out: I did actually answer his question
civilly. If you don't like the way other people responded, respond in
a way you think is appropriate. Don't waste your time bitching at them
about how they're wasting their time bitching.
