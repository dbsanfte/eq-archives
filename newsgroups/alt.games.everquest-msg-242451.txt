Well, shoot, I hadn't noticed you were on, and wasn't even much hoping for 
a response, beyond maybe random sympathy.  I don't know when I stopped 
using /who all regularly, well... maybe it was when my bestest friend 
quit without telling me and I got depressed by her not turning up for the 
umpty-umpth day in a row... but I'm rarely aware of who's actually 
listening to me.  :) Which meant your response came as a totally happy 
suprise, of course. :)
