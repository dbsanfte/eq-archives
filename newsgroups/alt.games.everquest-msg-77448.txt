The log file would not help you in the case of trying to report them to
Verant.  What you need to do is scroll the chat window to the point that
shows what happened, or them admitting what they did, then /report somename,
where I usually use the name of the offendor for somename.  Then /petition
explain the issue, mention it's reported under somename.  That is what you
should do in the future if you have a problem with someone.
