Depends on how much work you want to do.
I always wanted a site that would tell me what all these
silly items if find, forage and loot are for, that are taking up
all my inventory space.

Allkhazam's has a decent list for quest items:
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/qitemlist.html

, but it does not include many items, quest items
are missing, and most trade skill items are not on
the list. Most sites search engines are ok but miss
a lot of items.

Basically I just want a site I can go to to find out
What to do with the item I just found.

Is it a quest item?
Is it for a trade skill?
Is it just loot that I can sell?
Or is there no currently known use for it?
