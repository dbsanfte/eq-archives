I've gotten more silk than I can count from spending large quantities
of the past 8 levels in Dreadlands; most drachnids drop 2 silks.
I'm at skill 81 now (I burned off a pile of HQ pelts on quivers for 1
skill raise a few days before the pelts turned stackable) so I am
going to start making crystalline silk the next time I feel like
skilling - I am hoping I'll be able to go to Velk's and get some more
of that soon as I don't think I 3 stacks of crystalline swatches are
going to get me as far as I'd like.
I am letting my alts kill a lot of animals and they hang on to the
pelts. I was thinking of using the MQ and LQ stuff to make poison
vials but I guess you can get some of the MQ pelts if you really want
to make some studded leather - note that I don't exactly have vast
quantities of the pelts yet due to not playing the alts too much :)
