Honestly, on loot at my level, I rarely have any idea how my group mates 
are equipped unless they are friends of mine. Short of examining everyone 
when you join, I don't know how you would unless they speak up, letting 
all know what terrible gear they are cursed with. Call me paranoid, but 
that's also exactly what I would expect someone to do if they were 
misrepresenting their kit for a better shot at NBG loot.
