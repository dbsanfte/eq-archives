...and keep in mind that they're not likely to be sympathetic to
the "it was my husband's fault, not mine" story, because:

1.  The End-User License Agreement forbids sharing accounts
anyway, even between a husband and wife, or parent and child,
and:

2.  Just about every young punk who gets himself banned for
acting like an ass tries the "it wasn't me, it was my
stupid brother/sister/friend/dog abusing my account, you
can't blame *me* for that.." excuse.  (Which is probably
one of the main reasons for the "no sharing" rule in the first 
place.)
