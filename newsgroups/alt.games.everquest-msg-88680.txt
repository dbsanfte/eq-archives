I raised up four characters on Tholuxe Paells, then birthed a wood elf
ranger on FV. He is level 14. Fact is, if FV seems crippled by the language
block. Less information can be shared == groups function as unordered all
over the commonlands -- seems many have just decided that they cannot
understand each other, and thus try to get along with "hand signals".

The proportion of role played interactions is noticeably higher, but the
QUANTITY of role played interactions seems very significantly less.

Maybe things get better as you advance --- but I have never played a
character beyond level 30
