Just hit level 12, trying to get xp and loot in Blackburrow. Trains and
tunnels and bridges make it difficult, and crowds and inexperienced
low-level groups make it hard to succeed. where would be a good place to go
through level 16.  Please keep in mind I am a jeweler (skill 49) and want to
be able to make and sell items at reasonable costs.

Crushbone? Unrest? Chessboard? Accessing Felwithe and Kelethin for caster
support / gems. Using Greater Fay-Mart to sell?

Never spent any time in Freeport East and West Commons? What would be good
about those areas?

Also, any good chanter quests for level 12 that have INT or CHR loot, great
xp, or better robes? I did the Cubert earring quest in Qeynos catacombs 3
times.

Thanks for any advice
