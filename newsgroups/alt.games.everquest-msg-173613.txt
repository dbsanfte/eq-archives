I am in a guild that is fairly new and we are still getting everything
figured out.  We would like to get together a raid in the next week or two
and are looking for suggestions on where to go.  Most of us are between
about 30 and 50, and we can fill most of the positions needed for a raid.
As usual, loot is not the biggest concern but would be nice.  Any ideas
would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
