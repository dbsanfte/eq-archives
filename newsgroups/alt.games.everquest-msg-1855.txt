Geeeez, that's one dumb necro to try 4 times without asking.

If you were able to bind someone without being grouped with them, unless
they change the coding someone who doesn't like you can bind you in the
middle of a dungeon.  That would suck.

You also can't cast invis on someone without being grouped with them.  Why
this is, I haven't figured out.

And, of course, you can't group teleport without being in a group. :)

There are other spells like this...you sorta learn them as you go along.
