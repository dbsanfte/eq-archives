I've soloed outer Paw with a ghetto Paladin at L26.  At L30 that same
Paladin could keep the spawns outside the double door cleared about
80% of the time.  A group of 3 upper 20s who know what they're doing
will get bored there if they don't enjoy each other's company.  I
figure that the groups of 6 I've seen parked in the "bedroom" are the
same hardy souls who will bravely camp a single spawn outside with a
group of 4.  Past the double doors is a different matter, as it always
is when you compare fighting only melee mobs to mixed melee and caster
mobs.  But outer Paw doesn't require greater heal unless your tank is
a Ranger or a Monk (or a prom queen), Warrior/Paladin/Shadowknight
should have plenty of ac/hp by upper 20s to tank those gnolls just fine.
