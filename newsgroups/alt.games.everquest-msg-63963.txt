I kept smoking for a while because I didn't care that much about life but
have never been suicidal.  Kinda masochistic.  Then one day in April of '94
when I was still feeling masochistic I discussed with myself that though
cigarettes may kill me I wasn't feeling the pain.  So I decided that
quitting would be much more painful, so I did. :)  April 3, 1994 at 5:30pm I
finished my last smoke.

I still have dreams about smoking on occasion, but I'm finally over feeling
guilty about it. :)

(and no, I'm not into S&M :P )
