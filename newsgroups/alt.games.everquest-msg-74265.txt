Newbies can be funny, but I normally dont do anything like get them killed.

Experince loss is experince loss, regardless of level its annoying. I dont
normally go that far.

Although the things newbies do, man can it be killer to watch or hear about.

Hell some of the things I do and I am level 33 with 50+ days. Is that sad or
what? Heh.
