Ok I have seen the question "What is the easiest character to play?"
about a dozen times.

So I wanted to pose the question, what is the HARDEST to play and why?

IMHO of all the characters I have played, it was a Troll Shadow
Knight.  I don't know why but the poor guy just never seemed to be
able to level, after about 6 months of straight solo play he was only
about lvl 40 or so.  Then something magical happened, he joined a few
good groups, and made it to 50 in a week.  About that time I left the
game, and now I'm back again :)

I started a new Troll SK about a week or so ago, and with about 2-3
hours per day, he has just broken 40... I dunno why he is leveling so
fast this time, maybe just my previous experience and now I'm spending
all my times in groups or something, but anyways I can no longer say
Troll SK is the hardest.

Any ideas?
