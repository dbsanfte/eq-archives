By that reasoning everything is subjective. Reality is
after all how we perceive it. Also, by that reasoning I could simply
make the universe cease to exist by merely thinking it out of existance.
Or I simply kill myself thereby destroying my perception of the world and
the world along with it.

Evil 'is' a concept of that there is no doubt. However,  as far as humans
are concerned there are certain things when done by one person or
persons to another person or persons that are evil. That 'concept' is
what I think evil is.

Obviously we can't define evil on what a bunch of fanatic phychos 'think'
is evil. Why not use Charles Mason as an ethical compass then, and
let him out of prison? Or any other insane person?

If I ran a plane into their building killing their innocent people would they
consider that evil? Probabaly. But then if the exact same action
is different if the participants are switched then is that being reasonable
or intellectually honest?

How can an inanimate object like the sun or sunshine be evil?
Kind of non-sensical to apply it to such.

I assumed(perhaps I shouldn't have) that we are talking about evil as
it applies to people and their actions to other people. Your actions
and your state of wealth or being is entirely another issue I think.

Sure. I can also refute that 2+2=4. By simply redifining what 2 and 4 are
at my whim. If we can't agree on basic definitions of terms then we can't argue
reasonbly about those terms.

Well if it was what they wanted and liked it then it can't be considered
evil. Since no 'harm' was done. Context and intent are still part
of the equasion.

Well people with obvious mental problems aside. =)

Philosophically we can say that any person should be judged
on how they 'think' but in reality no one wants to let criminals
out of prison simply because they don't 'think' their actions
were evil.

> Subjective, you see.

Lets take a simple example. 2 people all alone in the universe.
Assuming both people are sane and adults.

Person A kicks person B in the knee causing harm.
Person B considers the knee kick evil since harm has been
caused to him and he is now injured and in pain. Now lets say person A
'thinks' what he did was not evil and was justified in his action. Fine.

Now Person B kicks person A in the knee. Now does A think B or
B's action are evil? If yes, then Person A is intellectually dishonest
in their definition of evil. If it applies in one situation it should apply in
all situations.

Another real world example are cannibals. Cannibals never eat
their 'own.' Meaning they never eat their own friends, family,
or tribe. They will however eat their enemies. Because they
simply 're-define' the other people as non-people. Therefore,
Their actions are not evil as defined by them as you say.
However, that does not change the fact that their actions are
evil. Since if a rival tribe were to capture and eat some of their
tribe members they would consider that evil. Re-defining people
as non-people is just being intellectually dishonest.

In their heart-of-hearts and intellectually deep down people
know what is evil.
