2000.. people?

what server do you play on? I've always been told karana is one of the least
populated servers and it has *WAY* more than that. bazaar all by itself is
at max capacity during off peak which is 550 right there.


maybe my newb tag is showing and im just missing something here.  its
entirely possible ive missed something since half the posts for this group
are mysteriously gone (something wrong with my news server today)
