Things like caps and the effects of stats have been tweaked a lot over the
years, so you have to be careful when researching this kind of thing.  It's
easy to run across information that was true at one time but is not true
today.

At one time, each point of INT was worth something like approximatly L/5
mana, where L was your level, up to INT 200.  After that, each point over
200 was only worth something like 1 mana.  INT over 200 wasn't worthless,
but it was generally better to concentrate on +MANA items rather than +INT
items to raise your mana pool, once you got your INT to 200.

I recall at some point they changed it so that INT over 200 did have a
bigger effect, and I think they've changed it a couple more times since
then.

Unfortunately, most web sites with information on this kind of thing don't
put a date on it, so it can be hard to tell when you are looking at the
latest research, and when you are looking at something that hasn't been true
since beta.
