Sigh -- I see that the noble tradition of haggling is becoming
a lost art.

Jazz, they're inviting you to open the bidding on a round of
negotiations on the price, so as to arrive at a price which is
equitable to the both of you, and you're insulting them.

I know that some people just don't like haggling (although
I've never understood why -- it's not an attempt to cheat
you, it's an attempt to arrive at a fair price which
takes into account the needs and situation of both the
buyer and the seller), but you shouldn't act as if your
discomfort is *his* fault.

The few times I've gotten the "ten plat" type of response,
I've retorted with "well, I'm asking 100,000p, but
I'm willing to negotiate".

If they don't take the hint then, they deserve to go
without the merchandise.

On a related note, it's a damned shame that the game
doesn't provide a mechanism for true "auctions", whereby
players put items on the block, and other players
try to outbid each other for it over a set period of
time.
