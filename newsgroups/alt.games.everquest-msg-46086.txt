I was screwing around in IC getting a bunch of dervs and dire wolves chasing
me for a monster train (just for the hell of it), I get too far ahead of
them so I sit down for 2 secs waiting (instead of running in circles) and
LD!  I'm sure I died real fast.

 The other day I was going after the Brood Mother in WK  and just as I ran
into the swarm I went LD.
