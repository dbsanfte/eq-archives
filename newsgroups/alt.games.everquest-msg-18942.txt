Hmmm, yes, sort of...you will really want to get to 9th and SoW for this but
if you get a SoW from someone you can do it.

Speak to that Clothspinner tart in Qeynos (Nerissa I think) she will tell
you she is worried and ask you to take her sister a note. Her sister is in
East Karanas (you may want to get some maps for this) Hand her sister the
note and you'll get a monogrammed cloth (snot rag) in return, leg it back to
Qeynos, don't stick around (I know you will and you'll feel really helpless
in doing so) hand the cloth back to Nerissa and she will give you (yet)
another note to pass to someone in the temple of life (faction willing) you
will likely receive a Bronze weapon (normally war club or mace)

You can make money by collecting stacks of 20 bone chips and selling them to
players (3pp is about the norm around Qeynos, more in other zones)
Once you have some plat then use /auc to offer to buy a better weapon. FS
(Fine Steel) is about 5pp an item, Bronze about 3pp and Velium about 10pp
(no matter what you here on that, velium does not proc until mid 20's unless
it's Coldain Velium) give an idea of what you are willing to spend. At worst
someone will sell an item to you at best there will be a mid - high level
character in the zone who may have something as good or better that he'll
just give you.

Do not beg, very few characters give anything to beggers, accept membership
to their ignore lists.

If you want one of these awesome items that others have, sorry they are
twinks, you may feel inadequate but you are playing the game first time
around and by working for every bit of Raw Hide and bronze yourself you will
earn more respect than asking for "spare items for a newbie"
