My groups often consist of shaman / chanter. They're the only utility in my
groups though.
Shammie slows and heals and often offtanks the first add (we mostly pull 3-4
mobs at a time to go faster). Chanter mezzes anything more then 2. Plus
drops a tash on every mob for easy nuking / slowing. If more then 4 mobs the
chanter will slow some adds to save the shammie mana.
An leftover mana from the chanter goes into nuking (which is no prob after a
tash).

If possible the chanter can charm a mob and use that for extra dps. the
sinia from the shammie helps a lot with it.
