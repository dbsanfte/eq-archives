No, Ben...a person disrespects that which has no perceived value to them.
Humanity as a whole is infinitely more valuable than your single self, so if
you have no value for humanity, then what does that say about how you
perceive yourself?

What the hell happened to you to make you so abusive and angry?  Maybe you
DO need to hug a teddy.  Hug something; angry and abusive is no way to go
through life.
