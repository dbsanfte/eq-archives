For one handed weapons, it is a little easier to figure. If the ratios
are the same, then the faster weapon is always better. But, on two
handed weapons with delays over 40, it's not so obvious because the
level damage bonus varies based on the actual delay. You really need
to wield both and see what the magic number is. I'll give a couple
numbers, guesses, based off your weapons to show what I mean. At level
30, the 16/40 weapon has a magic number of 42 (16*2+10). The 20/50 has
a magic number of 55 (20*2+15). You would need to use the magic
numbers to determine which had the best damage output by dividing
magic number by the delay times 10. So, the 16/40 would be 10.5 DPS,
while the 20/50 would be 11 DPS. So, the 20/50 weapon is better. At
least at level 30. At level 50, the DPS could favour the 16/40, you
would have to test them both again to be sure.

Since you were looking for a rule of thumb, for weapons with the same
ratio, it's better to use slower two handed weapons until around level
45, then faster after that. This is only based on personal observation
though, so take it with a grain of salt.
