yes, I understand that point of view, but what I am saying is post 30 it
isnt wise to train something that is really low. You will get hit alot and
not hit them alot, thus you may die. For instance I maxed hand to hand in
the arena, no chance of me trying that in the field. At the lower levels I
always tried to carry around as much of the different weapons as I could,
but now with heavier armour, I find myself being encumbered more often, so I
cant always carry that extra weapon weight. Being a halfling does have its
downside, low strength. But it actually is alot of fun to do in the arena,
and its not a waste of your time since you are raising skills. Just throw a
little PvP action in with your buddy and its a good ol time.
