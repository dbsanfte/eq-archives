With the caster changes, the students and such on the second floor now
prefer things like charm over the silly crap they used to cast.  It can be
dangerous even to 50 plus chars now if the monsters get a lucky cast on one
of their group.

Keys go on the keyring now, or at least did for me (I have all keys except
the one Tserrina drops).  Possibly you have to have keys to all floors to
get them added, but I suspect they can be added individually.  The keyring
itself is actually part of the character, not an inventory item, so once you
add a key to the ring, you will always be able to open the appropriate door
for the life of the character.
