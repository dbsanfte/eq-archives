First, throw a piece of wu's or cured silk in those "nothing" slots

Second, Dawnshroud Mountains has some very nice exp for 30+, the loot is
rather crappy though.  Lootwise, I don't really think there's much you can
do on the moon for anything really good.

And I don't know enough about BLs to say what a "nice" item that you can
farm is.
