    If that gear is droppable (most, but not all Bazaar stuff is), you get
part of that money back when you upgrade. When I upgrade, I either lose a
bank slot or get thanked by the gnome in Tactics.

    On an individual level, it's not too bad. But when you look at it on a
guild level, it's pretty bad. Right now we're in a three-way rotation in
Qvic. Every day, the mobs that drop this stuff repop every six hours, so mos
t guilds get in two rounds of kills in a day. Three mobs, 2 drops per mob
with about a 1/3rd chance of a drop being a 90 HP or 90 MANA aug, means 8
drops per day, or 84000 pp out of the guild bank every three days. The mobs
that drop legs/BPs pop once per day, so if you're Txevu flagged you can tear
through cash there, too - call it one drop per three days, assuming a
rotation and the chance of getting an 80 HP/MANA/END 3% Stun Resist aug.
That's over 100000 pp every three days, or one million plat per month. This
is money being spent to get the gear that drops raiding normally. Imagine if
every LDoN item on a points vendor also had an associated cash cost to get
some idea of the double whammy we're being hit with here. When you spend
cash, you're getting gear supplemental to that earned by doing those LDoN
adventures.

    The workaround for hostage and assassinate is pretty simple: wait the
one or two minutes for a new mission to be offered, and try again for one of
the desired types. Sadly, if one raid zone is screwed up (right now the top
raid zone crashes every time the first boss gets below 40% health), there's
not a lot that can be done to get around the problem.
