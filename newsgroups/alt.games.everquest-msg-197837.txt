    I bet this was the line of thinking at SOE: guilds like yours would
continue along the path they were on and not try and level up beyond what
the first tier zones would allow. After all, you couldn't all get past the
trials, and why would you want to skip content in the logical progression?
In a perverse way, it makes sense. If you can XP on PoV mobs, odds are you
could also XP on HoT mobs. So why would your guild still be killing them for
armour when they're so trivial that they could be farmed 24/7?

    But modern players don't think in terms of item progression. Why would
they, when they've skipped so much of it with items found in The Bazaar?
They think in terms of XP. The outdoor Kunark model, then the
Paludal/outdoor Luclin model, is built around getting to high level as fast
as possible, then getting the items you need with the advantage of the
higher level. So it shouldn't have surprised SOE that players would try as
hard as possible to level up to 65, no matter how dysfunctional it was for
their guild or themselves. What Dennis described is the result.
