That's me.  I don't know about this 30 barrier you mention; I've been at a
17 barrier for two weeks or so.  Eventually I'm going to take my characters
as far as they can be soloed, however far that is.

This is my friend.  His main character is now eight or nine levels higher
than mine, his alts are closing in on my main, and he's seen the whole of
Antonica and Kunark while he's been at it.  If I forgot my family, stopped
showering, ate only Chef Boyardee out of the can, and took caffeine pills, I
might be able to keep up with him.
