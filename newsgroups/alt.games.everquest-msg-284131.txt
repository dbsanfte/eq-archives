the simplest solution i can think of is simply to join a group where there 
is another tank - then you can be a dps (or the snare-man, as certain areas 
require) and work those weapon skills .... you kind of make your group 
suffer a bit, but if you only switch in the weak weaps for skillups part of 
the time, you won't be a burden ...plus if you *are* the snare-man, your 
group might be happy enough to let it slide (if they even notice)

...or do all that out of sync with another tank who wants to skillup also =)

if people let rogues in groups, they'll be sure to let a 2nd tank in, 
especially one with your fine reputation
