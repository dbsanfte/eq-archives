That's not much help for us.  The two other guilds
that we are in friendly spawn jumps for the big stuff
with don't /LFG.  They/we pretty much have a pretty
general core of people that can and will be at a certain
target at a certain time, as decided about beforehand,
and groups are already pre-made. I think that for any
major raid in the last 8 months our MT group and our
KS group have had the same 4 people in each
group, anyways, with an occasional extra or friend
along.
