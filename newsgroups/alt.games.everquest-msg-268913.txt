I admit I've been alone a lot more than people used to be, judging
from the tales I hear.  But that's not always bad.  I spend some of
my loner time working on stuff like farming light blues for
ingredients to practice tradeskills, or doing those tradeskills, etc.
And when I want to group with people, sure, they may not be in all
the zones like they used to, but there's always someplace suitable
for my level where I can go and find a group.

And the rest of my guild (which I only joined a couple months ago;
I wasn't in a rush to apply to one) does have mostly people who've
seen a lot of the game and have characters higher level than mine,
but they mostly have alts and are happy to play them, so I get to
run with them (with my main AND my alts).

And I even can usually find someone who's actually new to game so
my awesome year of experience (and general knack for squirrelling
away useful tips) can help out.  I do expect to have that happen
less often as new players will more often choose EQ2.
