But the flat out *best* security measure where Everquest passwords are
concerned is well within the grasp of even the greenest newbie -
"Don't tell *anyone* your password."

Because no one would read it. 

I'm a bit concerned about the new policy myself. Not that it's in

and all, but I'd hazard to say that the vast majority of the customer
base rarely, if ever, visits their site.
