DOH!!!   ;-)

The application's URL is not scapeware.com but in the interest of showing
people we are not trying to scam them... www.scapeware.com

We are not a million dollar company. We are struggling like most companies
to produce a product. Scapeware does not have funding and most of the code
is written late at night on Mountain Dews and a dial up connection. Even
Microsoft started somewhere. ;-)
