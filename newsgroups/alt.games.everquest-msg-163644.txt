    There are models other than the EQ "high downtime" model, you know.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Dark Ages of Camelot uses a very low downtime
(high mana/health regen outside of combat) combined with a low XP/encounter
to make the action non-stop. You can interpret this as non-stop grinding for
minimal reward, too. Imagine if your melee's health would regen to full in
one minute, regardless of your total HPs, as long as you were on no hate
lists, but the XP rewards for encounters were likewise scaled back so the
total speed of advancement was about the same. Would you be happier fighting
non-stop, or would you find the constant combat for little reward to be
tedious?
