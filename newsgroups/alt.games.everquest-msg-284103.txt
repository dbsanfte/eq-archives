I never claimed you were a bad cleric.  This is the second time you
have misinterpreted my comments about your conduct in this group.
This, right here, is why I find you annoying.

This is all I wrote about your skill:
"I'm not judging your ability to play.  I can guess that you have some
things to learn but not to a fault.  I am judging your conduct in this
group.  The attitude is what is annoying people, dear, not the lack of
knowledge."

They attempted to put you in to your place because you developed an
attitude.  An attitude, particularly in a person who is still quite
"green", is annoying.

For one thing, some Necros do get very annoyed when others assume they
should twitch on demand.  I personally don't feel about it as strongy
as them, however their feelings are understandable.  They react to it
kind of like you might react to someone telling how to do your job.
It's annoying.

> telling
> me I suck as a cleric

Telling necros who don't like twitching that they suck as
necros...telling druids that patch heal that they suck as druids...very
annoying.

> and that clerics as a whole are useless

There was a time in the evolution of the game where experience groups
depended much more heavily on the holy trinity: Plate tank, cleric,
slower.  All the other classes were non-critical and in many cases they
added very little to the group that another player couldn't add.  But
clerics were far ahead of anyone in healing, much farther ahead of
druids and shaman than they are these days.  There was a time when the
most a druid or shaman could heal for was around 500 while the cleric
could CHeal.

Some people became very annoyed with clerics who had an attitude and in
fact quite a few clerics did have attitudes.  You would run in to
clerics who would charge the group for peridots (used to be that your
HP buffs required peridots as components), demand players play a
certain way or refuse to heal, etc..  That isn't to say that there
weren't bad wizards or bad rogues as well but the thing is that you
*needed* the cleric so a lot of time you were stuck dealing with this
asshole in your group who only got away with it because he was the only
cleric in the zone.  You could kick out the other bad players but only
one class could be cleric.  That is why some people are still left with
a bad taste for any cleric they sense has an attitude.

No one was telling you that clerics are useless.  That is preposterous
and you acting as if they did claim this is very annoying.

However, others can rez (paladins and necros, as well as druids and
shaman being able to TP you to your corpse).  Others can heal.  Clerics
do these two things better than anyone.  However a druid or shaman can
generally fill in for the cleric, particularly when you have a paladin
tanking.  They dont have all of the same tools but the group can
function about as well or just as well without the cleric.  So yes, if
you are a cleric, particularly a relatively inexperienced (I'm sure you
play well but you *are* inexperienced, get over it--that isn't an
insult) one with an attitude, people will be quick to remind you that
they don't need you.  They aren't trying to tell you that you suck or
that clerics in general suck.  They are telling you that you aren't
god, not anymore.

The attitude is annoying.

They also beg for tanks, crowd controllers, pullers, slowers, DPSers,
and even snarers.  Do you have any idea how much a group's success
depends on a good puller these days?  How much a couple of
well-equipped DPSers can affect the group?  How much the group can
depend on crowd control?  How much a well-played and well equipped tank
affects group dynamics?

Trying to pretend that your job is the most important or that people
want you in their group because you are special is annoying.  It's
particularly annoying when you pretend to be able to judge what it is
that people want in their groups.  You are level 59, you haven't even
had the opportunity to group with 90% of the population.  The vast
majority of players, the ones you think you can speak for, are at or
near 70.

How can you even pretend to be able to speak for them?

People tell you that you are wrong and your reaction is to pretend that
they think clerics are useless.  That is annoying.
