Actually, he was more a radical than anything else.  But somebody who
sets out to turn "son against father", "daughter-in-law against
mother-in-law", & etc. is far from conservative.  In fact, he challenged
established authority at every turn, except for "Ceasar" who was used
as a tool to accomplish His purpose.  He was homeless by choice, surely
this is not behavior held in high esteem by your precious "conservative
movement".

I stand by my conviction that it is hypocritical for a members of a
political faction that explicitly holds materialism in high regard to
call themselves christian.  When you promote and hold in high regard
that which Christ taught was a nearly insurmountable impediment to your
salvation you are <not> making an honest effort to follow his teachings.
