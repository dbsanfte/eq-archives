Not to complain or anything, but how likely would that be for a now LV5
Gnome Wizard (no invis, no SoW or anything similar, just like anyone else at
this LV, only no armor except newbie tunic so only about 45 AC)?
The zones I'd have to cross (based on maps) to make the shortest (less
number of zones) trip would be the following.

Akanon
Steamfront mountains
Lesser Faydark
Greater Faydark
Butcherblock Mountains
Timorous Deep
Firiona Vie
Lake of Ill Omen  or  The Dreadlands
Frontier Mountains
The Overthere

Now I did see a possible way to jump the boat after the first major turn
(first island on your right) and go to the islands, then cross them and wait
for the boat coming from The Overthere which circles back around and goes
back to The Overthere. According to the map (on EQAtlas) there is a
soulbinder at the docks once I arrive, so dieing shouldn't be a problem (can
always bind when I get back home).
    That sounds possible, assuming my shortcut idea works (allot of
swimming, possibly 200-300 /loc which will give me a time to build up my
swimming skill).  Then I'd just have to hope that the group hunting wouldn't
think of me as a begger and let me loot (I've had some who let corpses rot
until I arrive there and then intentionally loot and destroy things...the
"if I can't/wont have it then neither can someone else" attitude).
    Any further input on this idea?
