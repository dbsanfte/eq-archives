OOC: Just to add to some of the anecdotal evidence offered, here are my
observations:

1) It happens occasionally twice in a row (just happened to me, which
prompted me to come here and post)
2) Seems independent of driver update issues, my system is as up-to-date as
they get, even after re-installing mouse
3) Moving the mouse during the loads doesn't prevent it (I've seen it happen
even after seeing the cursor move during load)
4) Clicking buttons during startup vs. hitting Enter key did not prevent it.

In other words, there is no known workaround that I'm aware of. Couple of
questions I would ask:

a) Is everyone who experiences this using XP? (I am)
b) Are we all using an optical mouse? (I am)
