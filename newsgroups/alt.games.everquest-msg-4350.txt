Do you have another drive you could use? A CDRW or something? Doesn't
matter what path you install from, the game won't refer back to the CD
anyway.

If not, then one (admittedly tedious) option would be to get hold of the
patch program for Everquest (eqpatch.exe?) - grab it from your CD on a
working machine or have someone email it to you (and the patch program
for ROK and SOV if you have those too) - and stick it in a folder
somewhere called 'Everquest' - if the patch program fails to find a
file, or the file it is looking for exists but has a different checksum
(because they've just patched it on the server for example), the program
will download it from the patch server to your Everquest directory.
Hence, as long as you have the patch program you can download the whole
of Everquest from Verant. Now, this is about 600Mb of data for Everquest
and about a gig if you include all the expansions, but it may be an
option if you have unmetered internet access over a broadband connection
and can just leave your cable modem or ADSL connection downloading the
thing while you are out at work or asleep or something.

This should work - the Everquest directory is fully portable, the
installation doesn't pepper your system with registry entries or DLLs or
anything.

Note that there is no way for you to pirate the software like this since
you still need the code from the back of your jewel case and a valid
credit card to activate your account, so I hope I'm not being out of
order for suggesting it.
