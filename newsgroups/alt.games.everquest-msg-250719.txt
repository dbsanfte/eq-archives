I played a druid to high 40's (mostly post-PoP) and nobody has ever asked
me for a port (it was difficult to *give* them away).  Every once in a
while I was asked for a SoW, certainly not often enough to be annoying
(but that could be because I would typically slap SoWs on people before
they even asked).

Thinking back, I probably had the most trouble with melee types.  They
seemed to pull more trains than other classes (perhaps because casters
would either go down faster due to low hit points or gate away?).  They
also tended to be horrific loot hogs (though it took a really bad loot
hog before I'd voice my concern - just once - and leave shortly after if
the behavior didn't change).

My (probably faulty) memory is telling me dwarven paladins were the worst.
