}Did you have the same problem as I, that WP would either write straight 
}Umlauts *or* Italics, but no *Umlauts in Italics* at all, because there 
}was no German WP5.1 driver for that specific Siemens printer? Sheesh. 

Heh, naw, I have enough trouble spelling 'umlaut'. :)

My issue is more with editors where the default mode on starting up is not 
input mode, and where I have to do something special in order to see codes 
inserted into text, and where I have to remember 4 different functions for 
each of the 'F' keys rather than having a simple on-screen menu 
(preferably that can be toggled on or off).

But those are largely matters of personal taste; I understand and respect 
the opinions of those who prefer it the Word Perfect 5.1 way.  It's just 
mind-bogglingly non-intuitive to me, and makes me want to beat things with 
hammers rather than actually write. :)
