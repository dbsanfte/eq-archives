How could any 'chanter even THINK about not giving clarity to
a hybrid, particularly when they are the main tank?  I group
most often with my RL buddy, who plays a 55 ranger.  I tend
to feel far more safe with him as MT than anyone else - He 
can pull aggro in .5 seconds (the time it takes to cast tangling
weeds).  A hybrid's spells are a huge part of their taunting
ability, any robe who wouldn't want them able to draw aggro
in a hurry isn't overly bright, and since they rarely med in
a fast pull group, clarity represents a massive increase in 
their available mana.
