My guild is working on getting the keys.  We've only got about 10 people
high enough but that's enough for at least the first time there doing piddly
stuff like doing the zone-in and the easiest wing (wish I could remember
which one that is, but it's been a while).

Any time I think of it my druid and enchanter port over to LIO and kill the
chancellor.  Also in the last couple weeks I've been to see Xalgoz a couple
times and gotten 2 fangs each time.  Now all I have to do is track down the
folks who want to go so we can MQ the key quest so that I can start picking
up more fangs & prods. :p
