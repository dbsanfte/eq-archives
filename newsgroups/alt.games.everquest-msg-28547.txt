Thanks for a good laugh, I needed it.

I turned guildchat off once because it was interfering with a hard hunt I
was on.  Next day I logged in and said hello in guildchat.....no answer.  I
did a "*tap tap tap* is this thing on?".....still no answer.  Finally, I
said "Hey you deaf bastards, someone better pull their head out of their ass
and give me a hello".  Then it hit me.  I never turned guildchat back on
from the previous day. They had been greeting me the whole time and I was
giving them a barrage of shit for not answering.  I got a few tells of "WTF,
Hark?", but most of my guild just got a chuckle out of it.
