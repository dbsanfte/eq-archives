For maximum damage, you need to put the best damage to delay ratio weapon
you can find in your off hand, regardless of what it's delay is.  There are
no damage bonuses for the off hand, so it's only the weapon stats that
matter.  If your skill is already maxxed, or close to maxxed in dual wield,
then the delay on the secondary hand is not important.

For example, lets say that you have a 25% chance of your dual wield working,
and you have a choice of a 21/30 weapon, and a 10/15 weapon for your off
hand.

So, every 12 seconds, with the 21/30 weapon, you will average 21 points of
damage, with the 10/15, you will average only 20 points of damage.  Which
one should you use in your off hand?

For your main hand, you have to also consider the damage bonuses when making
the determination as to which weapon is best, generally, a fast weapon is
best for the main hand, even if it's damage to delay ration is not as good
as a slower weapon.  This is highly level dependant however.  At low levels,
you are best off with a good damage to delay ratio, but you have to watch
the damage cap.  At high levels, you are best off with a very fast weapon.
