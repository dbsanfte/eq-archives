Actually, while I agree Melees are easier than casters for a long
time, at 60 raiding "uber" mobs it is *noticable* who plays a warrior
full time and who doesnt. Just spamming the taunt key doesnt cut it
and can *lose* you aggro faster than knowing when to hit it.

For example, we have a 60 warrior who is sometimes played by himself
and sometimes played by a necro in our guild, who seems to have got
the password by sending him pretty pictures of herself (dont ask ;) )

You can ALWAYS tell if its him playing or her. She sucks at keeping
aggro.

Positioning in places like ToV is also absolutely vital - things warp
if they get pushed through a wall, you have casters hiding behind
corners/firepots to avoid AoE, etc, and its vital you dont allow the
critter to wander its AoE range over the clerics. 

Once you factor in the additional importance of keeping rogues behind
stuff, trueshot paths clear, 1000pt ripostes avoided, enrage, etc,
being a high level warrior actually does become a tactically involving
position.

Its not the same as tanking for XP at all.

You have a casters perception of this, to be honest. It would be like
me saying "It isnt hard to know when to CH.... ya just do it when
they're getting low right?" or "It isnt hard to know when you need
to mez; theres more than one of them."

Sure, thats nice, but the practice is a little more involved.
