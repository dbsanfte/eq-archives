Best advice in making a wizard, particularly if you're used to playing a
warrior:
"Don't."

Get used to never being able to get into a group, dying all the time,
and having spells who's chief power seems to be to get the mobs laughing
so hard at you that they may fall down briefly, gasping and holding
their sides, giving you time to scamper to the zone line.

Unless your warrior can manage to get j-boots for your wizard. Then it's
a whole new ball game.
