No, I wouldn't be shocked, because I'm a programmer, and so have had
occasion to read books on user interface design.  On of the most interesting
things they tell you in those books is that users usually don't read
dialogs.  It is quite normal for users to just go right for the OK or YES
button.

This makes interface design challenging.
