If you write your hotkey like this:
/stand
/pause 11, /cast 8
/pause 3, /cast 8
/pause 3, /cast 8
/sit

it takes care of fizzles for you. The pause happens after the cast even
though it's written before it. I think I've got the timings set up close to
yours (maybe slightly higher due to a laggy connection). I don't know why
you don't have to pause for 14, but it seems to work with less! Maybe it is
due to a constant latency.

Get yourself a custom UI which shows the percentages all the time - it makes
life a lot easier! I think my one is called blue2, which I'm pretty sure is
meant for bards, but since I like to swap my weapons in and out, I like it!

I tend to keep myself regen'd at all times - the math just works in your
favour!

Agreed - we're one of the few classes that talking cuts into our mana regen
:(

It's like a ghost town! The 3 people were probably fighting over the

I always remeber getting adds (I agree, the casting gobbys are nasty) there,
but whoever got jumped would shout, and the other 2 or so groups would come
and help out as fast as they could - it was just the way things worked on

This is one of the only zones I found Scale of the Wolf to be useful in -
when the sh1t hit the fan I'd get my group to leg it, do my best to root
things. I remeber the giants running at my SoW speed, so I'd fire off a
scale of wolf and hope that got me far enough away that I could make it to
the zone.
