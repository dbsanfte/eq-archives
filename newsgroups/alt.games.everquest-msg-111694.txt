Sure, people will offer as much as 10pp for a stack of bone chips
sometimes. It's usually either through generosity or having had to
argue with idiots in the past that think they're getting ripped off if
they're offered less and not wanting to deal with that hassle again.

I've seen people offer 100pp or more for a port. Does that mean that's
a fair asking price? Hell no. If someone offers a high price, fine.
But asking a high price is silly.
