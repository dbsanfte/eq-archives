You know how surprisingly true this is? I started a new wizard and was
grouped in CB. I  complained about the cost of new spells and a group member
went out to get some food and drink and came back with all my lvl 14 spells.
That's 50pp easy. He told me he was saving up for a Darkwood bow (ranger)
but that he was so far from it that he gave up. How nice is that. He gave me
almost all of his money.
Ofcourse the next day I logged on my 25 ranger, made him a Shaped Compound
Darkwood and a quiver full of  arrows.
