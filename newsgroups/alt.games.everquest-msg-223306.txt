Hi all,

After checking around various sources, I decided to do my own testing with
regards to mount speed.

I've recently upgraded to a giant drum on my shaman (thanks, LDoN!) and
decided to put it to the test.

I went to Qeynos Hills near the North Qeynos zoneline, cast True North then
started running. After a second or two, I took a /loc, then did the same 30
seconds later. For the mount, I let it get up to speed by waiting 10 seconds
before taking the first loc.

I used my beastlord alt to find the base run speed (no True North, but I
managed to stay within the cobbled path over 30 seconds, so should be
reasonably accurate). He managed to travel exactly 894 units northwards in
30 seconds, which I've rounded to 900 for simplicity's sake.

This gives:

Spell/mount      Units    Relative amount    Actual amount (from Lucy)
Base             900      100
Small drum       951      105 (5% increase)
Run3             1163     129 (29%)
Spirit of Shrew  1161     129 (29%)          30%
Spirit of Wolf   1386     154 (54%)          55%
Spirit of Scale  1524     169 (69%)          70%
Spirit of Cheetah1907     212 (112%)         115%
Giant drum       1925     214 (114%)

Unscientific, but it shows two things:

* The large drum seems to be on a par with Spirit of Cheetah.
* The small drum offers a very small increase in speed, not even Run1 speed.

The characters used were a L65 shaman and a L40 beastlord, neither of whom
were encumbered. Both characters were running rather than walking.
