Short answer:  no.   Hunting in Mistmoore (or other areas in the old
world) can raise Ring of Scale faction.   Skyshrine is on Claws of
Veeshan faction.   Ring of Scale is Kunark-era;  CoV is Velious.  The
three main Velious factions (CoV, Coldain, Giant) aren't affected by
actions taken anywhere except Velious, as far as I know.

(Well, that excludes choice of religion/race.   Giant faction doesn't
default to KoS for at least one class/race/religion combination.
I'm not sure if bards get a default non-KoS in Skyshrine if they worship
Veeshan.)
