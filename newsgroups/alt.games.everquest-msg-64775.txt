Come on Win95 is 10 years old now?  You can't ask software manufacturers to
cripple their product to support 10 year old OS's.  Gee I might have to get
a new video card, or faster processor or more memory, that's fine but a NEW
OS HOW DARE THEY! :-)  Win 95 wasn't a great OS to begin with $80 for
Win98SE will give a more stable machine.
