Resists are only based on the mob's resist VS your level compared to
the mob's level and the spell level or something, and the mob's saving
throw. It has nothing to do with your wisdom or your skill levels. At
times some mobs are just going to resist more than others, its the
luck of the dice. Some particular spells you get as you level are just
going to be resisted more. I remember one druid spell that totally
sucks ass as far as being resisted was immolate. I quit using that
damn spell soon after I got it because it sucked ass and was not worth
the mana. That was the only druid spell I remember being ressed a lot.
