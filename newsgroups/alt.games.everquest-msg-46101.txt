My shadow knight has acquired a necro partner; we're currently both 17
and hanging out in Overthere. I don't use pet (wimpy little thing that
it is) so his pet and I tank. If need a breather to cast a spell
uninterrupted or lifetap, I let his pet take aggro. He does his dot
thing, darkness, lifetaps, heals me and fears; I siphon str, disease
cloud, lifetap and can also fear. We've had some downtime due to him
having low mana and my health being low, but if I find a blue and
don't get adds, pet and I do the tanking thing, and if he casts dots
less often (especially on blue mobs) we'll be able to lose most of the
little downtime we have. He's not a *perfect* necro healer yet, but
we're getting there :)
