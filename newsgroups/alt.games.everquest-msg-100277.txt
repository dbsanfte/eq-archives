Another example you can use is the two skeli guards at the paineel newbie
area, conned green to my shammie in 30's or 40's so attacked one out of
sheer boredom, huge oops. Then there are the 3 guards at the tower tucked in
a corner to right of the gnolls in Lake rathe, lvl 20ish they had a nice
blue con and hit for 100+. Massive undercons ;)
