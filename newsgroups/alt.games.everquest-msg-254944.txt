Others can answer this a lot better than me considering my new status 
but, I will say this. EQ for the PC has *seven* expansions, with an 
eighth on the way. The PS2 version doesn't have any that I know of.

No, PC players cannot interact with the PS2 players (thank God).

If you don't mind your son on the computer all the time then the PC 
version would be a better option. However, if *you* ever want to use the 
computer, you may want to get him the PS2 version. ;)
