Thus far I've played several, including human, erudite, dwarf, gnome, and wood
elf.  And I have to say........ TROLL!!!!!!!!!!!
There simply aren't enough trolls in the world.  The recent "Fippy Fact" on the
EQ homepage showed that less than 4% of the player base is composed of trolls.
It's a lot of fun, once you get faction in a newbie heaven like N. Freeport, to
go hang out at the bank.  The lighty newbies come up and stare in wonder, having
never run into a troll before.
  I actually had one gnome come running up to me this week and say, "My......
you're very big."
  Yes. Thanks Sherlock. Here's a couple copper. Move along.
