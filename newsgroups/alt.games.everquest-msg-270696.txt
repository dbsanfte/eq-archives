In WOW you have auction houses, where you can put an item up for auction, 
set a time limit, and even set a buyout price (optional). You dont have to 
be logged in at all.

All the items appear on the one menu with the sellers name next to them.

You dont even need to go to the auction house actually. You can keep a level 
1 toon there, and just mail him the items, and he can mail you back the 
money. Only you cant mail hoarde from alliance an visa versa.

There is an Alliance auction house in Ironforge, a neutral one in gadgetzan 
(which noone uses), and a hoarde one somewhere.
