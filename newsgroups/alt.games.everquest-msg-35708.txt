This is true. As I said, I am quite familiar with the trains in that zone.
Most folks who spent any amount of time there get a 'feel' for
the train mechanics in that place.

I could have been coincidence.  I don't believe this one was.

On another occasion I was on the top level and watched some
Enchanter get to close to the pit with a pet in tow.  Down went the
pet.  Not sure what happened then as I zoned and camped for the night.
