Happened to my wizard yesterday in Fear.  I was playing my enchanter but a
wizard robe dropped, so I hurriedly logged him on and got him up there and
looted the robe (16 seconds left on the clock!!), stuck it in inventory, sat
down, and camped.

A couple hours later someone wanted a punt out, so I logged him on and
promptly forgot about him until I glance over and see that he's now in
Skyfire (bind).  So I scrolled up to see if maybe we missed a roamer or
something.  Nope!  He had no sow or anything when he zoned in the first
time, visible, and he had time to loot and camp...so no critters from before
could have dotted him.  No minibosses up (except shissar!! YAY! A good
friend finally has her epic).

I scrolled up.  What I saw was that...I died.  That's it.  No hint why.
