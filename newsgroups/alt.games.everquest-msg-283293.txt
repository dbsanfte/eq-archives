 Well to beat a dead horse - IMO unless your in a uber guild your
gonna get screwed over. High-end guild on bert didn't care for me
telling everyone that a group of thier guildmates were training in
Rathe Mtn (also IMO so they can hunt as they please without sharing)
and used what I call an exploit. They got a bunch of high end casters
around my char and started casting. I only saw 4 of the casts then I
got the 'You have been disconnected' screen. I'm guessing they lagged
me down since the disconnect was immediate after the text appearing on
the screen. At the time I was typing out a petition.

A GM came in and I told them what happened. They of course wanted
proof. Anyone know how to get proof after the game kicks you the char
screen? Can't can you. The GM said they would look into it. They were
gloating about what they did the next day. Zero accountability since I
am a single account holder and the guild has well over 400 chars.

>And I suspect what I'm doing is talking myself out of logging back in :)

Let me help you on this. Read the above. Then go look on the EQLive
forums at all the 'deleted' messagess. Then head over to berthall, and
possibly any other server message boards.
