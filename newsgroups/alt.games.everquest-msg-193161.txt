What you can buy today is a good indicator of what people who
buy games are likely to have.  I wish I could find the numbers, 
but a large percentage of new release purchases are made by
people who have recently bought a computer.  Therefore, the 
average system in homes now is fairly unimportant, as writing
a program to run on those would require either more resources
(to support low end as well as high end systems) or a game
which doesn't take advantage of new hardware as well.  In 
genres where graphics are a large part of the attraction, you
can't afford the 2nd option, and the first costs more than
it will bring in from people with low end machines.  I'll 
wager the final requirements for SWG push close to 1ghz and
256MB and at least a GF2 level card.  EQ2 is already aimed
at GF3 level cards and up.  Remember that the original EQ 
*REQUIRED* a 3d card when they were for action gamers only.
People said that was going to kill its sales.  That's why the
original AC had a software rendering option, they thought they
would bring in more people by offering an option for those
without a 3d card.
