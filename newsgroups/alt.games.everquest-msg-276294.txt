I liked the way EQ2 handled the situation.  Most magic items must be
'attuned' to you, meaning you can either use it or hand it/sell it, but
not both (i.e. once it is attuned, nobody else can use it).  To me,
measures like this or some sort of item decay are necessary if you want
to have crafting being any part of your economy (otherwise, say 6
months after game is released, how could a new crafter compete at all
against all the drops from mobs that have been generated, plus vs. all
the crafters that came before him, etc?)
Of course, you'd still have people making or finding these things and
selling them in their 'unattuned' form, but how's this any different
from people doing the same thing in game?
Obviously, another thing to add is that the game should limit an item's
effectiveness to the level of the wielder, in other words, me wielding
Excalibur shouldn't make me a better swordsman than an experienced
fighter with an iron sword.
