It's been a long time since I played EQ, and I know that they've
gradually made death less and less painful.  I have this vague
recollection that originally dead bodies evaporated relatively quickly
(e.g. on the order of a few hours).  I may be completely wrong on this
though.

I did have a couple of times in EQ where it was late at night, my body
was in some spot (like a raiding area) where recovery w/o help was
going to be absolutely impossible, and I was pretty worried that the
gruop / raid I was in would dissolve w/o my getting my body back.  I
felt compelled to continue playing, even though I needed to get to
bed.  Other times my body died in some wall or rock somewhere due to a
bug such that it was physically impossible to get to it, and it was
necessary to bug a GM to retrieve.  Those events weren't fun or
exciting, they were just a royal pain in the ass, and if it had
happened more often I would have quit EQ sooner.

I've thought a lot about the whole "EQ death hard WoW death easy"
thing and I'm not convinced that overall, death is so much easier in
WoW than in EQ.  In WoW you take a monetary damage hit each time you
die, rather than an experience hit, but you *always* take that hit.
EQ, as I recall, once you get past a certain level you are probably
grouped with someone that can rez you back with only a tiny (or no)
experience loss.  In that sense, death is more painful in WoW than EQ.

It is possible to rez at the graveyard in WoW, but you do take a
significant hit in terms of both cash (25% of your durability) and
some play time (you are out of action for about 10 minutes because
your stats are reduced so much that your char simply cannot fight).
So you don't have the "o my god if I don't find my body I'm screwed"
anxiety, but you still have pretty strong motivation to run and find
it, rather than just rezzing at the graveyard.  I've played WoW since
a couple of months after it's release, and in all that time I've
rezzed at the graveyard maybe 5 times.

As far as just blithely taking deaths, the cost of dying in WoW  is
enough that I certainly don't know anyone who does that.
