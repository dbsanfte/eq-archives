This is also a pet peeve of mine...  but not in quite the same way.
Rooting the mob and then expecting the melees to move the fight elsewhere is
not good crowd control.  It works, with a bit of pain, but it's not easy to
move a mob that is in combat with you.     (At least not as a warrior).  It
takes a lot of hate to frenzy a mob to the point where it will chase you,
rather than just switching to one of the other melees that are now much
closer than you.

And really, it comes down to this.   You're a shaman.  It's pretty damn
trivial for you to get a single mob to chase you, just slow the add.   (in
the rare cases thats not enough, DoT it or cripple it.)   If it's chasing
you, take the opportunity to get it out of range of everyone before rooting
it.

With good root parkers you won't really notice that you don't have an
enchanter / bard.   With bad ones that just barely understand the concept,
it's actually worse than having no crowd control at all.   ("It was happily
beating away on the tank before it was rooted.   Now it's still banging
away, but it's hitting the rogue instead.")
