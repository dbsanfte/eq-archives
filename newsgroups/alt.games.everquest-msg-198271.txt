Make a character.  Type /testbuff.  You are now level 25.

It maxes all your skills for your level (except tradeskills and languages), 
including alcohol tolerance, fishing and begging.

It gives you 3 no drop bags of no drop gear.  This was the most interesting 
part for me as I got to see what gear SOE considered average for level 25:
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=687931
All the gear is named "Cleric <slot> (test)"

It gives *most* spells.  BSTs didn't get their pets and SHMs didn't get 
canni.  I'm not familiar enough with cleric spells to tell if my cleric got 
all his or not.
