I was killing about as many mobs per hour with my 50 chanter, as with either
my 50 druid or 50 necro. (well they are all above 60 now, but when they were
50). In some places the pathing is "more friendly" without actually being an
exploit. Fear them on half health. Of course if you want to use pathing
exploits its *really* easy. I hear POJ has a good spot for this. I know back
wall at velks is another cheesy spot for this, but not much use post 60.
Just in case anyone didnt know, 49 pet dual wields, so give him a rusty
dagger for his second weapon.
