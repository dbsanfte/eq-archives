I would have simply responded to the Warrior:

"Sorry, friend, but you've been misinformed. This isn't about warrior aggro,
that topic never even came up in discussion. This is about someone who had
issues with not being allowed to take over leadership of a group that was
already competently led. In other words, ego. The fact that they made up a
story about complaints of warrior aggro doesn't surprise me, but it didn't
happen nonetheless. Anyway, no point in your worrying about something that
didn't happen."

and be done with it.
