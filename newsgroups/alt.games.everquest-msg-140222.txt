I say hell yes. waiting 15 minutes for those ports was stupid
and pointless. Anything that make getting around easier
and spreading people around I am all for.

One of my big pet peeves of this game is traveling somewhere

Then if your group/guild decides to go try another location or go
back to where you were, then there goes more wasted time.
