Back in the old days, there was no size limitation on Minor Illusion, and 
you could move while under it, so it was common to see buildings 
wandering around.

The problem was that geometry that big was never meant to move in those 
zones. The limitation was imposed because enchanters tended to get stuck 
in the landscape (or worse, fall through it) a lot.
