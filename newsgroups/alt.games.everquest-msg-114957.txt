Funny semi-related anecdote, an RL friend of mine had applied to be a guide,
and got an acceptance email, which was about 20 minutes before he got
another email that he was banned (he had been using memory edits, such as
the sow hack), then, he still kept getting CC charges for 3 more months on
the banned account, and each time had to harass his CC company, bank, and
Sony to remove charges.  Now he has an account active that he never plays...
