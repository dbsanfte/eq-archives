    Makes sense to me, oddly enough. They're gonna change the breath weapons
to NOT be line of sight, they're going to modify pathing to allow everything
to scoot under the bridge ASAP if aggroed on from there... that sort of fix.
To take every "tactic" that uberguilds have come up with and screw them
over.

    Don't get me wrong - I'm a tradesperson, I see what screwups they can be
on a daily basis. But from all the screenshots I've seen posted, and what I
know, I tend to believe VI here on the zone's level of completion. I
remember that you had to run the Velious patch to get "additional ST
textures", so can believe the player taking the screenshots didn't run the
patch. The explanation that Kerafyrm came out because of the way the GMs
tried to stop things also jibes - it's easy to believe a GM didn't know what
he was doing and, by /killing the final Warder brought out Kerafyrm. (Note
that this means that if the Warders are all poofed by terrain, like the Dain
sometimes poofs when pulled badly, that Kerafyrm will spawn.) As for the
scripting being off, again, nothing I saw supported that - zones with
"plotline" dragons reported correct /shouts going off. What else did you
expect to see happen?
