Nope, it's call Thanksgiving, as in I turned off the computer for a
few days.

As for the roleplaying "debate", it's fairly senseless to try and
argue since you all seem to be fixated with the idea that EQ is a
roleplaying game.  When the best you can do it basically roleplay with
each other which can be done on a public IRC server without ever
having to shell out more money than what you would otherwise pay to
your ISP.

And they usually have a MUCH higher uptime than EQ.

But hey, it's your money and your time.
