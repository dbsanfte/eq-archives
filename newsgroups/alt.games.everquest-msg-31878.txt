The bread run quest didn't *match* fighting for XP, it left it spinning
in the dust. Besides, it was unfair in the sense that it was an XP
firehose for porting classes, but not so much for people on foot.

The game is still there for you to play as you see fit. Of course, if
you want levels and phat lewt, you *have* to fight, but the game doesn't
force you to. I've spent weeks without earning any XP at all, just
travelling, helping people, doing tradeskills and trying to find quests. 

What you cannot do is having your cake and eating it.
