LR5/ID5 for starters imo :>.

Well.. EQ isn't a game you can just level yourself into Time or God
gear.

Not necessarily true on runes, runes can drop off any of the 4 wing
bosses in BoT in single group. And what you can do as a mage in BoT
with CotAM and a druid snarer can be criminal.

If you are going to play effectively at the level you are starting
at... you pretty much need to be open to some raiding. Even if its
going on open raids for flags to get to elementals.

We see things completely different. 65 anything with poor gear and no
AA in my eyes isn't maxxed out, its just getting started and is a
relatively weak character. But if the time and effort to level it
without the gratification of a DING! or even xp while you raid isn't
for you, maybe you should quit.
