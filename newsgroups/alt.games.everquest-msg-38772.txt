I don't know, I picture somethign out of Starship Troopers where the bugs would
stab you through the back with a razor sharp leg if you turned arond on them or
they got behind you. Nasty stuff if you REALLY think about it.
     Now the real question is, are the spiders in all of Norrath a giant hive
mind and are one day going to overwhelm the cities and lands as a giant
mass......Them and their allies...The Scarab Beetles.
