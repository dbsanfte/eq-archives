My druid friend has over 1000 AC, does that make him a tank too?

1/4th? Where did you get this figure from?

Even if a shaman has equal AC to a warrior, their HP is going to be
nowhere near as high.... meaning they won't last as long. 

Nor will they have decent defence, parry nor riposte, so the mob will
be getting more hits on target.

They won't have any defensive disciplines. So again, they get hit
harder and more often.

They don't have a taunt button. So when the cleric heals the shaman,
they have no chance of taunting it off them.

Shaman weapons suck the donkey's nads, as do all of their offensive
stats, so its going to take *much* longer to finish the mob off, by
which time the cleric will be OOM and the rest of the group will be
cursing all of their various gods and asking each other WTF decided to
accept a shaman as their tank.... LOADING PLEASE WAIT

They can? For how long?
You use the word "good", as if they *could* make a primary tank, just
not a particularly *good* one. Show me the group who'd bypass an SK,
PAL or RNG to take a SHM on as their tank and I'll show you a group
who are fond of corpse runs.
