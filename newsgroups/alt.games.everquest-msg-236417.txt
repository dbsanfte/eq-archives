See thats the thing I was getting the message at lvl 2 (I grouped to
kill a lvl 5 mob it's sick I know).  And noticed that I only got the
message when grouped as the leader.  Then at lvl 10 I headed to CB
joined a group, and a guy that didn't have GoD asked if I wanted to be
leader since I have the expansion and he didn't.  I have no idea what
command he issued but soon I saw "You are now leader of this group"
and again I started getting messages about the leadership experience.

I have NO clue what this is for, what it does, or how it works, thats
why I'm asking.  I HAVE done a search on google, and what I am reading
is conflicting.

I pegged the folks here to be experts, so I figured I would ask.

Also as to my prior question, while doing a search in google, I found
the answer.  Allakhazhams has a list of each zone by level, if you
click on the zone name, it will bring up a description of the zone,
and occasionally a statement like "This zone has a 20% experience
modifier" (runnyeye had 20% I IIRC).

Also I noticed that there wasn't a mention of an exp modifier for
paludial, although to be honest, it does appear to have one from what
I read.

I am going over to befallen and runnyeye (they have the highest exp
mod for my lvl range) and see if I can level quickly over there.

I think after I break 65 with this char, I'm going to compile a guide
on how to do it quickly, because in all honesty at lower levels life
tends to suck very badly.  You tend to get in groups where NO one
knows there job or how to do it.  Or you get Lennie Ubertwink the noob
ninja looter, who maybe did 5 points of dmg, because he was busy
cleaning up the corpses while everyone else was pulling Emporer Crush
and his royal guards off his ass.

Or you get the mage who never bothered to buy elemental shield for her
pet, and so she feels the need to step up and melee the lego that is
beating the piss out of her pet(whom of course she targetting to the
wrong mob) rather than casting a dd and ending the fight.

Or like I had last night, JumJum the wonder cleric who kept casting
healing and buffs on the damn mob, because he didn't know how to calm
down, and target properly before casting.

I intend to take my warrior to 65 as fast as possible, so I can earn
enough cash to play sometthing that can solo it's way to a higher lvl
(i.e. a mage or necro), I have read up on all the strategies I can
find and honestly these two can possibly solo into MUCH higher levels
than any other characters in the game.

Don't get me wrong, it's not that I want to be anti-social in this
game, but I did originally play back in pre-kunark days, and stayed
until luclin (then I had to work on getting a real life going) now I'm
back and I just want options on playing.  When I left I had a high
level mage, and a lowbie warrior (20 something I think) and I would
very much like to get back up to those again.
