While that used to be true, it isnt any more and hasnt been for a long
time; expansions have increased the girth of the world, and the populations
havent spiked in a similar manner. I've dungeon crawled sebilis, which 
used to be the most camped zone in the world.

Even still, with super camps, the 'linearity' was not imposed; the
camp was not your *only* choice, there were others, and over a period
of time, months perhaps, you would explore the dungeon, grow to
understand it, get to know the regulars in it, and so on. That in and
of itself was fun. A LDon dungeon... its the same randomised
collection of pointless hallways every time - nothing to learn, no
structure or point to the design, no story or immersiveness and, of
course, the six people you took in and no more, at all.

The old dungeons are what _you_ make of them; the LDON dungeons, with
their time limit imposed and entirely unimaginative design are just
a really boring arcade game ;) I had to buy LDON to find this out
though, I quite liked the premise at first hearing.

Yeah well ;) The name could have changed if they'd realised the flaws
in LDON early enough in. The later expansions thing is a good point,
in that, LDON has some interesting technology that could be well used
with better 'story design'. The problem I see is the last few expansions
havent done that open ended 'the players make the content, we make the
world' story thing I liked about EQ very well at all. Other people are
always more interesting than scripted content to me; thats why I play
a MMORPG and not baldurs gate ;)

Think of mistmoore castle; there is an architectural and cultural
'theme' throughout, but the place is designed like, well, a castle. There
are kitchens, servants quarters, ball rooms, studies, bedrooms, gardens,
and so on - variety, and that variety provides a stage on which you
can play out your own little dramas, stories and frivolities.

LDON *looks* beautiful, its just totally empty. I wish they'd get the
designers of the old EQ together with the artists and techies of the
new... then you'd have my ideal game ;)
