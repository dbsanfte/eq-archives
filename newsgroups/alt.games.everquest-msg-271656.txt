I played EQ for over a year on a very similar setup... it was a 2.4 GHz 
laptop with the same nasty graphics card, but had 512 MB of ram and an 80 
gig HD.  It was fine even on raids, but the onboard graphics eventually got 
a bit fried - it's got alot of glitches now (like when watching a DVD, if a 
subtitle pops up, the movie goes black... and some random lockups etc.)

Be sure you set Texture Quality to 'low', that makes a huge difference, and 
turn on only the character models that you really really want.  Also helped 
to keep spell effects off, or at least set it to 'me only' or 'me + NPC' in 
the options.

So all in all, you can play EQ fine on that computer, but try not to do it 
for too long - it will kill the graphics card eventually.

When OoW came out, I had just gotten a brand new and very nice computerm, so 
it was very nice to play with all models and high texture quality on with no 
lag ;)

These are zones that have been added to the game... such as Stonebrunt 
Mountains, that druid/ranger zone off of Surefall Glade, etc...  not sure if 
these still need to be patched through the optional zone selection..

Good call on downloading these, since you never know when you'll get a group 
going to one of these zones, and you'll get booted or ported to a safe point 
when you try to zone in, because you don't have the zone file on your 
computer.

ShowEQ is used by alot of people - all it does is give you really really 
good tracking, showing you where and what everything in the zone is.  I 
think SOE has stated that they don't care about programs like ShowEQ, and 
would rather try to get rid of the programs that actually modify the game 
(like macroquest)
