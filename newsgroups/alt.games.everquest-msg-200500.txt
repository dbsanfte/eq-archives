Ah, so anybody who voices a complaint is, by your definition, a control
freak.  Fascinating.

I'm not 100% certain what you're trying to say there, but if I'm
correctly reading your intent I must say that your "style" of
illogic is at least consistent.  I'll bet it saves you a lot of
research time, this claiming of your personal interpretation of a
single data point as proof of whatever it is you're going on about.
