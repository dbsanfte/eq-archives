    Ok, so buff and sit aggro turned up through the roof. I'm guessing
proximity is also an issue, even though you discount it, since the quarters
are pretty cramped in CT and the casters will be a LOT closer than normal.
Do any of your warriors have BoC's or Hatebringers? We just got two BoC's on
Wednesday (a very, very good AoW loot drop on Wednesday - two BoC, pants,
helm) and already had one Hatebringer-equipped warrior, and I'm wondering if
THEY could hold aggro against stupid things like buffing. Did you notice how
heal aggro went? If it's bad we could also use paladins with Wave of Prexus
to at least get the mobs on something wearing plate (that isn't a cleric or
bard). After SIX freaking deaths last night doing Arch Lich I'm kinda
sensitive about heal aggro. :-)
