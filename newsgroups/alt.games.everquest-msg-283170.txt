Hi -
just downloaded the trial and (3 hours later) patch and finally got to
the starting "Isle" area on Everfrost.  it seems really really laggy
and choppy.  It's not my laptop as it's running w/ 2 GB RAM and the Ge
Force 7800 video card, etc. and so forth.  So since I've never played
EQ before, am wondering if this is typical for just the starting area
due to the free trial or if this is the nature of EQ gameplay...?  I
played Wow for about 6 months (got sick of it/bored with it) so I'm
familiar with what it's like to play when the server is lagging vs.
when it's not and seems like what i experienced tonight was server
lag--soldiers running by and then *blip* they're running by again, or
goblins in front of you then *blip* they're off to one side....

Thanks!
