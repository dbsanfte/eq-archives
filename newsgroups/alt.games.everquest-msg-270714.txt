There are 4 places the message can be in the meting hall.  Downstairs near a 
dark elf, above the door on a thin ledge behind a secret panel, and 2 other 
places upstairs.  Personally I would try downstairs first, then the ledge. 
If it was not in either of these places I would leave the zone, wait until I 
can enter again and hope it wasin one of the two places.  Also you will need 
Snoop skill of at least APP II if you are not going to be spotted by most of 
the mobs in there.
