The damage healed display reports you were healed 100 points
when in reality you were only healed to your health cap... so if you
are uninjured or have taken only 50 points, you still see
100 points healed.

Admittedly this has no more impact than what you were saying,
but its slightly different.

Safe spots are of critical importance, on the other hand, finding
an area free of roamers means safe medding, fighting with no
adds, a CR spot, a buff spot... I'm not clear, though, how
removing safe spots would positively impact anyone's play,
unless you just aren't feeling sufficiently challenged.
