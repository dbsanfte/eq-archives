On Sat, 20 Apr 2002 00:46:24 GMT, "Sean Lowe" <abuse@attbi.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Doesn't have anything to do with getting waxed by one, does it? :-p

Definately both. First 10 really fly now. But necros always leveled
fast.

All the pure casters get the squeeze put on them at L8. You're not
alone. Spells get unexpectedly expensive in a hurry.

>Necros are cool and powerful!

Yes.

A *lot*. It wasn't unusual to need a good 50-60 solo blue kills at
L*3*. Not anymore, its cut in at least half. Five hours to 10 is
normal now. Five hours (untwinked) would get you to 6 before.

 experience, as it allowed me to sit back and count the number of ways
 the Internet has corrupted me and exposed me to a world of stupidity
 and filth that I previously never knew existed."
