You have as much chance of finishing that quest as you do winning the
next three lotteries.

When you are 60+, then you can start thinking of farming the reets for
the crown and hunting western wastes for the furs.

You need to set your sights lower, bub.

I think you will get laughed at. And no one will help you. The quest
takes some major work even for people who are at the proper levels to
do it.
