No.

No. Parse your logs and you will see higher dex actually makes
no difference.

Oh hell no. For a warrior AC and hit points are extremely important.
In the later levels your job is not to do dmamge. Its to take damage.
You have to be able to hold taunt and be the meat shield for everyone
else.

Dex only affects the proc rate for weapons with effects and
Archery. What effects your hit % are your weapon skill, offence
skill, and any spells that add directly to your attack rating.
