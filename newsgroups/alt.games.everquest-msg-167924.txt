How extreme? Aka, do you know your prescription (sperical, cylindrical
and axis numbers appreciated if you do know it - I am studying
optometry). 
Personally, my nearsightedness is where they would have problems
getting me contact lenses if I wanted them, the glass for my glasses
needs to be specially imported, and I've been warned to avoid
activities like boxing as I am disposed to having my retina detach
from the inside of my eyes.

I feel sorry for heavy computer users who use contacts instead of
glasses.
