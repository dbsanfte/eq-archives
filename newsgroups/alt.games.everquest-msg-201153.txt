I been doing the "semi-tutorial" noobie question in Gukta with my
froggy shammy; the one that is started with the guild letter you get
and then go to the banker etc. I have killed a troll and returned with
his head to Gaz Commander Giidib. I hailed the commander and he told
me to first destroy the head and then hail the elders of the council
(in this quest everything works with hailing instead of the usual turn
in of items). I moved on to room 9 on this map
http://www.eqatlas.com/guktamap.html
where the elders are (used to be Troll SK guilde) and hailed them all.
I waited for the messenger loop to start and all others to come in and
hailed them all again. They all just kept saying random lines to me; I
don't know what to do now. Am I doing something wrong? allakhazam does
not list this quest.
