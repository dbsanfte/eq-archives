well, sorry to bring things from part 1 into part 2, but there was something
i wanted to say but by the time i thought about it the thread was gone....

anyway, last time i commented on the guild of dwarves, gnomes, and halflings
called the pigmy coalition, and i just wanted to know if they call their
guild meetings "little get togethers."  if not, they may want to consider
it...

that being said, i should probably comment on part 2.  i was thinking a new
guild could be called the alliance of loners.  also, i saw a T-shirt once
that said "Slackers Unite!  Tomorrow." and i was trying to figure out how i
could turn this concept into a guild name, but i couldn't think of
anything....maybe something about procrastinators working for a better
tomorrow....i dunno....i'm just rambling now....is anyone still reading?  i
should probably stop typing.
