Not complaining but please tell me it was a spelling mistake. Over the last
ten years I have seen this gradually coming into common usage (hmmm, perhaps
that means it is acceptable now) and I can't believe that it is a spelling
mistake. I see "longer...that", "bigger ...that", etc. I really believe that
(some) people think that it is correct.
