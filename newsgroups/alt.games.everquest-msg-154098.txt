I've lucked out then, because with the exception of a handful of pick up
groups, I have found myself with good strong players who know their classes.
Then there is the odd duck like the chanter who told me it's faster for me
to mez and insisted and making her pet fight.  (Serious about this one.  A
groupmate and I had to go afk to stop laughing as hard as we were.)  Over
all though, and I think this also depends upon the server, I have had no
issues with pick up groups, some of my best friends online were met in pick
up groups.

As for the server making a difference, I think that the older servers tend
to be better for pick up groups.  For the most part a majority of the people
have played for a goodly amount of time and there isn't much in the way of a
lot of blind leading a lot of blind.
