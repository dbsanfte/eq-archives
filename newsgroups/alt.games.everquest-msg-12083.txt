Buy a small sewing kit if you can't afford a large one.

Kill spiderlings, each time you have two spiderling
silks, put em in the kit, combine to make a Thread.

Threads stack, so you can get up to twenty together
in a single slot.

Also kill wolves, bears, and cats that are decent exp
for you.  Ruined pelts can be combined with patterns
to make patchwork armor pieces and more importantly
to improve your tailoring skill.  But its Low Quality that
are important.  Combine each low quality pelt with a
thread to make a leather backing - these sell to high
skill smiths for around 5pp each.  Don't be shy about
asking that price, the smith is going to turn that backing
into a piece of armor that will sell for over a hundred pp,
and should be happy to give you a decent cut for doing
the drop only part.

In fact, sell to a smith a few times and you can probably
get a good deal on a skinning knife, which will let you
turn all those annoying MQ and HQ pelts into more valuable
LQ pelts... don't do that to the HQ bears, those can fetch
10pp each with no work done.

Lots of other ways, but this is one that gives you exp work
and pays well, gives you a skill and gets you in good
with a highly skilled tradesman
