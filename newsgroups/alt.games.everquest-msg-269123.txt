I used to canni dance on my shaman, and certainly seemed to get a lot 
more mana back this way than by just standing there and chain casting 
canni; wait for a tic, stand, cast canni, sit back down till the next tic.

If mana regen is gradual, than this shouldn't generate much more mana 
than just standing, since I was standing about 3/4ths the time

Long before running a shaman, I learned this trick from a druid, who 
would stand up, hit melee, and sit back down, I used it for quite a 
while with my cleric.  The key was to get a high delay, high damage 
weapon so you could sit out the time in between delay cycles.

Not only did this seem to work, but I ended up taking it a step further, 
when fear kiting, I'd literally sit for about one second per tic, 
because I'd have to get up, run up to melee range from the fleeing mob, 
hit, and sit.

Not only did this "bunny melee" style seem to generate just as much mana 
as sitting the entire time, but there was no noticable difference 
between the "sit 5 seconds out of every 6" original style and the "sit 
one second out of every 6" chase plan.  As long as I was sitting during 
the actual tic, I got the same amount of mana back, as far as I could see.

That was a few years back, mind you, and long before they started 
listing the actual mana number on your character... it should be much 
simpler now to determine what is going on.
