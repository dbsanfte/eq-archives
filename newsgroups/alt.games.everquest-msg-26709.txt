It's just your level.  Right now you have plain ol' boring heals.  At level
34 you get Superior Healing, and at 39 COMPLETE healing, not to mention
other healing spells.

Any group with a tank who would pick a shaman or druid over you as primary
healer at level 34 would have to be nuts.  Even NOW your heal is a little
more mana efficient than the shaman's.  That's not including Specialization,
either (since I don't know what shamans should Spec in).

I'm honestly surprised the shaman has time to be primary healer, what with
his Slow debuff on critters.  But it IS a refreshing change to hear about a
shaman WILLING to be primary healer.
