Most people pay 10pp. If I need money my druid pops from zone to zone
announcing that I am porting for donations and list the places I can
port to. (No....if I dont list WL and CS then I cant port there....get
it?...also do a /who on my name and see that im only 34th) Sometimes
high level players pay a lot of money for ports and when I have
several people in one ride I dont even ask for payment from others.
However, when im doing it for the money and im spending a lot of time
going from zone to zone looking for customers then I usually want 10pp
for safe ports and more on the IC port. A wizard porting to Skyfire
deserves a LOT....i wouldnt do it for less than 100pp.

Last week I was in WC /oocing Porting to <destinations snipped> for
donations and I get a tell from someone asking for a port to DL. Turns
out to be an iksar monk (why are the most troublesome players either
halfling druids or iksar monks?) who is decked out with equipment
including epic. I invite him to group. I give him sow, regen, str and
skin. I mem combine port. He says hes ready. I wait a minute. He asks
whats the hold up. I ask if hes gonna pay. He says he cant......he
just spent 66k on an item and cant afford a port. I couldnt believe
the nerve of some people. I then ask him if hes ready to go and he
says yes. I mem combine gate and say "INCOMING" and leave his cheap
ass standing there like a jackass in WC begging for a port. I should
have ported him to Toxx.

I was leveling my wizardress in the Lake of Ill Manners last night and
there was a druid named Portingforcash. As usual, a contentious
argument arose in OOC about how a warrior demanded a port up front and
mr. Portingforcash wanted payment up front. I brought up the subject
of a 60th monk with epic who just spent 66k on an item but isnt
considerate enough to carry a few plat when he knew he was going to be
requesting someone elses services for a port. To my suprise (or
not....it is LOIO after all.....probably iksar monks) the monks in the
zone agreed with him that even if you are high level you are always
broke and never carry money anyway so i should have ported him. I said
that was like going into a resteraunt and asking for a meal then
saying you cant pay because you are wearing your jogging shorts and
you usually dont carry your wallet in your jogging shorts.

No ports or rez for joo!
