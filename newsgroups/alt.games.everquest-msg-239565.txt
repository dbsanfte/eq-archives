i play on the role playing server.  (what's it called again? some bigass
name that no one in their right mind could spell...but you know the one i'm
talking about) why did you need to know this? are you going to see if you
can identify me by my capitalization errors?

p.s.
i don't want any "i know how to spell the name of that server" posts.
remember i said no one in their RIGHT MIND, meaning that someone of
reasonable intelect would probably not sit around trying learn how to spell
bigass names of eq servers, nor would they take the time out of their day to
look it up in the little booklet thing that came with the game when they
could just say the RP server and have everyone know what their talking
about.

p.p.s
i just wrote that now so i wouldn't have to defend myself in a later post...
