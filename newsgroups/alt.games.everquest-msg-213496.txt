This just applies to your first character. After you learn your way around
you can try anything with confidence.

Don't chose human or erudite for race. They don't see as well as other races
so it is a pretty miserable experience.

Don't go with an evil race, like troll, ogre, dark elf, iskar.

Don't go with barbarian because their starting area is to hell and gone.

Don't go with evil class, like necro or shadow knight.

Don't go ranger or paladin. They don't get their spells until level 9 and it
will seem like it takes forever to get those first 9 levels.

It is a *good choice* to go with a magic user as your first character. Most
of the other character types are really dependant on equipment. Spell
slingers can just about go naked for dozens of levels.

Good races that are hard to fail with are halflings, half elf, gnome, high
elf. Wood elf is good, but I hate the damn tree city they live in. If you
choose a wood elf, be prepared to repeatedly fall to your death.

Just dump all the points you can into either wisdom or intelligence
depending on them being a wis caster <druid-cleric type>, or int
caster<magician-wiz type>

A while back I was jumping servers. My intent was to run another ranger on
that server. I decided to run a magician up to level 20 so he could supply
my ranger with summoned arrows<level 20 spell>. I went with gnome magician
and it was a relative breeze to get him to level 20. Probably the easiest
character I have run to date, much easier then even my human magician. Great
for farming items for money and about as good a killing machine as you can
get in a head on battle.

That isn't to say other characters aren't powerful or easy to run. Just that
they would have a hard time competing with a magician in several areas.
