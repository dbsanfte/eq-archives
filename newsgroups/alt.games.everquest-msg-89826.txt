Last night, on the way to the pet store, I saw a parking spot I wanted. 

Another lady needed to drive by it, so I paused with my blinker on. She 
slowed in such a way that it looked like she was going to grab my spot... 
so I said to my wife "If that bitch ninja-loots my spot I am going to be 
pissed"

And my wife, bless her heart(she doesn't even play!), says "What, is that 
spot nodrop?"

home. I just gave up after a while. I figure if I want to talk
to me, I'll just have to do it in person.)" -Walker
