I have looked online at the various websites for quests for my lvl 25 ranger
and my brothers lvl 25 cleric to do, without too much success so far, trying
to find out about a particular quest just ends up confusing for us relative
newbs :)

On a recent trip back to Kelethin, I saw a new NPC (I think he was new, dont
recall him being there before), I cant remember his name, but he wants me to
find someone who has been kidnapped by some troll pirates called broken
skull, and to get on a mystical boat??

Could we do this quest (if we figure out what he even means, he also
mentioned some farmer called Tarnik McWillows).

If not are there any other interesting quests such a duo could do at our
levels, or should we exp some more?

We would prefer quests for cleric stuff as I seem to be able to get better
equipment easier at my level than he does.

Thanks for any help.
