Sort of happened to Draglorvin ( my warrior ) the other day.  I got a port 
from DL to Butcher from a guild-mate to train Riposte.  Went back to the 
docks after bandaging some young dwarves that were sitting at the entrance 
to Kaladim.

The shuttles -finally- take off.  We zone into TD.  The first shuttle gets 
to the boat and *poof* the boat disappears.  The shuttles turn around and 
take us back.  Urgh.
