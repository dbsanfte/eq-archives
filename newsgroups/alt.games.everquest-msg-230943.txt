I think Firona Vie has a pretty good set of low level people. Admittedly
alot of them are re-rolls, that are twinked to the gills :), but that means
sometimes if you pay attention they will give you some good hints on things
to (not) do.
Also expect that the new graphics update coming with GoD might lessen that
gap with the new games' engines. Also I am guessing that as we aproach
February that there will be a new package out that will contain all
expansions except GoD, so waiting a couple of weeks might be fiscally
responsible (if that matters) and save you 20.00 or so.
Lastly I agree whole heartedly that EQ would still be going after 3
years.................... Look how long it has been going, and look how long
UO has been going.
