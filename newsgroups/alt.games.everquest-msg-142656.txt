You dont have a camp. They should by common courtesy pull from the
bandits away from you. Common courtesy doesn't spawn in Pal Cav, IMHO.

PC is the LOIO (Lake of Ill Manners) of Luclin. In my group I have had
Ninja looters, OOM looters, sandbaggers (Let me go to the bathroom -
for a half hour), incredi-pullers (20 bandits inc), and intentional
trainers (Lets get that other group out of here). It is a frightful
place where teenage testosterone runs high. (Not talking about
chronological age either)

I avoid it, but I always return for the incredible exp. If I get there
early, I make up a Alpha loot, share bronze, be nice group. I often
have to join a ninja loot - dood speaking - idiot group.

This is why I got sick of PC but the exp there is awesome.
