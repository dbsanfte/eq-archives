You should spend less time chiding people for not reading, and do some of it
yourself.

We go, in the same paragraph, from talking about killing every single human,
to a leak from a nuclear reactor, and suggesting that it could not be
categorized as natural selection.  Given that we're talking about whether or
not mankind is "fit," it is clearly being suggested that a leak from a
reactor is a "big deal" (TM).  That, is the concept I'm disputing.
