Just like real life.
Fools and their money are soon parted.
Gambling in any form is idiocy.

Better some kids learn this lesson in a game then
keep the knowledge for real life.

Its not like they lost anything 'real' anyway.

If anyone whines about losing pp this way I just laugh in their
face and say tough shit.
