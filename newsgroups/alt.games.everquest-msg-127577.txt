Provided you get a response from  GM. I zoned from TT into EJ with PKers on my tail
the other day and fell for 245 damage (thanks to safe fall 200, or it would have been
more). I was under the world for a loooong time. 3 petitions expired unanswered so I
logged off and went to chat.
Yup, 4 GMs in chat were chewin' the fat and claiming that they couldn't come to my
server. They said that they didn't have the SWAT tag and they were stuck on their
allocated servers. After pointing out that 4 GM's on the chat server and none on
Rallos wasn't the best man management I'd seen (more or less word for word, no
cussing, ranting etc), I was booted to desktop. Detention for dissent? BAH.
I logged back on and used my Thurg gate potion in the end.
On a related issue like this, about level 20 or so, me and a friend in Ill Omen zoned
into FM one day low on health and died from 10,000 dmg from falling in the middle of
the zone. We did get a relatively fast response from a GM, but he didn't believe our
circumstances and was not going to res us. After some arguing and some people who had
seen us zone out spoke up for us, he ressed. Great. Level 20 ressed right in the
middle of FM where we fell, left to fend for ourselves surrounded by scowling red
cons. Oh joy, joy.
Now, I always am polite and reasonable to GMs in situations like this but it seems to
me if a GM didn't get any last night (or got told to go to bed early by their folks),
some can be downright unreasonable and bad tempered. I'd have taken names too and
complained, if I didn't think this would earmark me as a dissenter. I believe each
player has a history that GM's can check to see if players have asked for resses
before.
