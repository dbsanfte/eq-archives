Wow,

Thank you folks for the info.  I will get right to it.  I must have
missed the "audio trigger" tab or whatever in the options.  I thought
I knew that well, but when they were first introduced, I don't believe
the interface was set up for it somehow.  But you all have set me
straight.  I feel kinda silly missing that.

In addition, you have opened my mind to all sorts of possiblilties for
their use (using your examples).  I do a lot of 2 and 3 boxing and
triggers would help me in many ways to determine that, for example, my
druid box's "snare" macro did in fact take.  I usually find out the
hard way, with an eventual train in a LDoN?  Hehe.

Again thank you for teaching an ole EQer (6+ years) new tricks...

Joe
