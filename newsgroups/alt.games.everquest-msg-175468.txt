But Khosh, what you have to understand is that, while Jedis are the most
powerful combatants, fighting is only one small part of SWG.  There are
many, many other ways to be a very advanced character and many other facets
to the game.  Yes, I personally intend to be a Jedi when I play the game, if
I can, but if not there are plenty of other things I can do.  Also, the
extreme rarity of Jedi will mean that you won't have the problem of
constantly coming up against them and losing miserably -- and there are
other ways to deal with a Jedi besides combat :)
