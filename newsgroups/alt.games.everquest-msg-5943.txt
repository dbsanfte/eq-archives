At least I think that's what the group is called. Anyway, last night I
was in Crushbone, soloing for the first time. I came upon an elven
slave, for whom I had a key. I went to hail him, but after having
fought so much is such a short time, I accidentally went for the
attack button instead. I took a major hit with the Merchants because
as soon as I attacked, my pet followed, and I couldn't pull him off
before he killed the slave. The other factions that went down were
kind of a bummer, but the merchants directly affects my finances. How
do I raise my faction with them again? They con apprehensive, now, and
I notice they charge me more, and pay me less for goods. I want to
make things better. How do I do that?
