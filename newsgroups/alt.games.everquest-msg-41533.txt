I have to admit, I didn't read the whole post, but I had to laugh when I saw this
line.  You don't follow Israeli politics very much, do you?  Israel is split between
MANY political parties, to the point where to form a government even extreme
parties that have just a few seats in the Knesset have to be courted.  It would
be hard to pick out any country in the world for which your statement could be
less true.
