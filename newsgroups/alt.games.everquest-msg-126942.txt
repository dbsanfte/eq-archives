I'm sure you meant to say AE mez only works on 4-5 critters.   (5 btw)
Stun of course works on unlimited number of critters within range.


Choice of spell/method also depends a lot on level.  I tried
mesmerization (ae mez) on a train of icebone skellys in guk way back
when I was level 25 or so.  Got lots of resists, died, decided it was
a crap spell and stopped mem'ing it.  A few levels later a train hit
us in DT (lower guk) and we would have died with me trying to single
mez it all.  But another enchanter was there waiting for my spot in
the group and saved all our butts with with mesmerization.  

Humbled, I started memming ae mez again and have found it useful all
the way up to level 60.
