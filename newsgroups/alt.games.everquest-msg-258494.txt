I bet my dark elf doesn't get to just buy the last rank, either.

No more ranger gate.  <sniff>

Most painful thing of playing FF XI is having to blood warp to save time 
(Travel is very 'old eq', i.e. slow).

Fortunately you can change jobs to something level 1, and let it take 
the xp hit (which is effectively nothing).

teh leet buffage.
I read about this, this is the 'you can have more than 15 buffs' AA.

I am a charter member of that one... Do you lose agro when you get ko'd?

Some Dev MUST have a sense of humor.

That one goes on my enchanter's 'to do' list. Expect to pick it up 
around 2020.

Assuming this is non-enchanter 'perm illusion'. And I think most 
illusions last an hour or two. If it works like permanent illusion, it 
won't be quite permanent... they can't code that for some strange reason 
(or couldn't). 'Permanent' illusions (used to) wear off in like 36 hours 
iirc. I understand best use for the PE was picking up one of the group 
wolf form buffs... 36 hour sow. :)
