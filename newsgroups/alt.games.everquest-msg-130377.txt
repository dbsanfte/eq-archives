Yeah when I told this knob that wasn't uber but a 40/40 Reaver was....he
then said he's sell that for $80 bucks...I laughed at him and said I like
using the "game" to get my loot, and that, to me, seemed like cheating the
system and whole point of EQ! I mean any knob can e-bay an account, I play
for fun, not to "win" the game!

Yeah when the MMORPG becomes just 2 folks in the zone, i think a "personal"
tell is okay, and /ooc at that point is rather silly, but oh well!

Too bad the druid was busy, I mean I like helping folks out, but if I can't
then there is nothing wrong with being polite and just saying "Not now, I am
busy.".
