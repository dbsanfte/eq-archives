Forget about the amount of time think about the money you can make during
this time!  I hunted exclusively in EverFrost during 30 killing Wooly
Mammoths, the goal is  to work on your melee skills now, I bought a fast 1HB
and went to town snare/fear/low DOT/melee, just keep it feared, got my 1HB
from 30 to 100 in this time.  Nice part is the tusks they drop sell for
8-10pp each and they are common drops, I made over 1K in this time.
