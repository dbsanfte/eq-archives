That does not prove my statement wrong.  The fact that you do not
behave like that does not in any way affect the players who do so.
I have participated occasionally in NBG where I didn't know most
of the players I was grouped with, but these groups/raids have
<always> included at least one person I trust who assured me that
the people involved were on the up-and-up.  Lacking trustworthy
assurance of that sort there's no way in hell I'd do it.  There're
too damned many liars, scammers, and cheats out there.  I've met
them, I was bitten a few times in the past, and <your> assurance to
me of <your> personal honesty would be a pretty pathetic reason to
not learn from experience.

Go reread what I wrote, I did not specify the likelyhood of it
happenning, I simply asserted that it did happen.  You go ahead
and take your chances if you like.  But given how you've talked
about the "public raiding community" on your server I'm wondering
just how unknown the "strangers" in your pickup groups are to you.

Ah, let me translate:  Because they were too damned stupid to go
to another zone and/or find another group where they wouldn't be
used (or more accurately abused) to pharm somebody else's loot?

see previous.

NBG has such a bad rep on Tunare that hardly anybody uses the acronym
anymore.  These days, in raid planning and guild groups everybody seems
to take the trouble to type out "can and will use" to avoid any possible
association with the many assholes out there who've ripped off other
players in the name of "NBG".  NBG sucks, it's bullshit, it's a lie
promulgated by the naive and the greedy fucktards who prey on them.
