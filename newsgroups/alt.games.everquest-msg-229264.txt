All good points.  Actually, if the server wasn't so insanely populated, I 
might be more tempted to stick it out, but with this competition going on 
and the server bound to be taken down or wiped in a month... eh.  I dunno 
if it'll go down significantly from its current insane level.  Plus, 
because of the death = level 1 n00b rule, the newbie zones will never 
really empty out.

Hm.

Imagine that death rule on a hardcoded teams server like SZ.  I'd like that 
more -- there'd be people you'd know you could trust, I think, and 
slaughtering an enemy would have a real effect.  I guess there's an evil 
bitch in me after all, though I'm a n00b to PvP.

Be interesting to see how Discord ends up.
