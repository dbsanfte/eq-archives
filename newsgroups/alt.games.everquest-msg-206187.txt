Well, Never.....

Only joined the Drinal server about 6 months ago, but never seen a GM on.
Was speaking to a guide that answered a 3 day old petition and when asked if
they were busy, they said, yes Drinal is in urgent need of guides and that
there was quite a backlog of petitions there when he logged onto it that
morning so yes, he was quite busy.

But judging by his response I gathered that a GM hadn't even visited the
server for a week or so.....
This holds true when I see all the crappy names running around.....
Latest one's I've seen were: Natallie Portmann,  Pornnostar.... and a few
others just as bad.  I just shake my head and cringe.
