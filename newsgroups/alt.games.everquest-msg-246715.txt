Certainly. But I shouldn't have to toss my PCs security out the window 
to apply for a beta. Note that I've never suggested that the beta app 
itself is likely to be harmful, I'm merely irate that SOE would not 
merely require, but thoughtlessly require me to enable features of 
Internet Explorer that are best left disabled... particularly since I 
prefer not to use IE at all.

Its like a body shop setting it up in such a way that in order to phone 
them to book an appointment for them to work on my car my home alarm 
needs to be disabled. Similiarly opening and enabling and running 
internet explorer should not be a requirement for the EQ2 beta.

They could have easily achieved the same thing without such a silly 
requirement.

The probability of it happening is moot...

And I didn't suggest that. I suggested that a hacker could digitally 
sign an activeX component with a benign sounding signature, and replace 
a legitimate activeX component with it.

The point is that a signed component just means that *if* you look at 
who actually signed it, you have 'RSA's gaurantee that it was in fact 
them who signed it, and that it hasn't been modified since. But if it 
was in fact signed by 'eq2betacorp' a holding of 'haxxorsRus' how many 
people would even catch that?

Now **THAT** was in specific response to the OPs assertion that a hacker 
would be unable to hack a signed activeX sig. And my counter is that the 
hacker doesn't even need to... he can sign it with any signature he 
wants... 99.9% of people don't check them anyways.

I would venture you are mistaken.

Unreasonable? Yeah. It is unreasonable. Sony has no reason to dictate 
(indirectly) what internet browser i use. They publish a game to a 
platform, and its reasonable to dictate platform specifications for that 
game, hardware and software. However, EQ should not have IE5 or later 
with ActivX enabled as a requirement anymore than it should require 
outlook express or photoshop, its unrelated to the model. They had to go 
out of their way to do something dumb to make that a requirement.

Fortunately I have little interest in the EQ2 beta. The beta will not be 
running at full bore, it will not have much contnent, it will be buggy. 
I have better things to do with my time then working as an unpaid soe 
tech. To those of you who want a first glimpse at things to come, by all 
means I don't criticise that, some people like seeing the 
pre-trailer-teaser for a movie...I don't care either way... i don't 
avoid them ... but I couldn't be bothered to jump through hoops to see one.
