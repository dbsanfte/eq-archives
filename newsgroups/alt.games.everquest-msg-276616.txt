I'm not sure I'd agree with that from what I've seen,
at least as a practical matter.   Why would a miss
be counted as much as a hit?   But, yes, a resisted
nuke might get aggro even though it doesn't do any
aggro.   But for melees wouldn't it practially equate
to the same thing?

In my experience it mattered how much damage I was
doing, not how much I could potentially do.   (Speaking
only as a monk trying to increase neglected two-handed
weapon skills vs a monk with dual weapons with less
damage rating but maxxed skill.)   It didn't matter how
much damage I *could* do -- since I wasn't doing much
the druid in our duo would get aggro extremely quickly
vs the same mobs where I'd never lose aggro using dual
weapons.
