Subject: Fair Division of Cash

It's time SOE finds a way to divide cash fairly.  If they can make the bazaar
work they oughta be able to find a way to make this work too.  For a game that
is so "pro grouping" to NOT have a *fix* for this is just ... thoughtless.   
Quite often my friend and I would like "groupmember" but we decline because we
are both casters and the tanks tend to be the looters.  And you don't have a
CLUE what they are REALLY looting.  Only that you are getting the chump change
that is left over.  
The "master looter" idea is great, but only if you KNOW the master looter in
your group personally and trust him.  Otherwise it is just CRAP.
I really feel for monks, who NEVER get to loot because of weight restrictions. 

Throwing my 2 cents worth in, again.
