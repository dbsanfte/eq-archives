OK I have a  Bstlord and I've always wondered what the deal is with
that "DISARM" button under Combat , thats always greyed out? 
I've looked around and From what I can tell we don't get that ability
so what the hell is this button for?

Comment: If you really work for them, why are you asking on Usenet how
the game works?

[...snip...]

Just from the vibe I got talking to the deveopler of the upcoming
Planes expansion at E3 this year, Verant is just keeping it alive a
little longer. But in his words " No plans of yet for any expansion
after Planes, but if there is I wouldn't be surprise to see that high
elf on the cover beating a dead horse." off the record of course.

[...snip...]

And they are betting BIG time on SWG, but they can't lose on that one,
Star Wars is just way to big of a property to blow, and Lucas games is
helping them out of course, from what i saw of the game at E3, it WILL
blow EQ's numbers out of the water.

Comment: You had to go to E3 to talk to a developer? And what's with
referring to "they" and "them". Shouldn't that be "we" if you actually
work there?

No it's not, not for a online community, right now EQ is in decline
with it peaking when Luclin was released. SO in reality the community
fail in 3 years and began to died. A game like SWG should last
indefinitly concidering that someone can become a mayor of their own
town and such. That takes time and a 'GOOD' in game economy, which EQ
never had.

Comment: In the current thread you claim that EQ had 400k subscribers
over two years ago, but in the post referenced here you're claiming
that it peaked with the release of Luclin. For a guy who claims to be
on the inside you sure seem confused. Especially since in yet another
thread you claimed EQ only had 35,000 subscribers in the US.


And I won't even go into the one where you apparently thought you had
been visited by a succubus in the middle of the night while sleeping
in your room at your parents house.
