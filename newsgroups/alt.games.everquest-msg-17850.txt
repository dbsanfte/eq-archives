I know the smiths a jewlers spend an incredible amount of time and
money perfecting there skills.

  I know they have a hard time turning profit long term.
I know they have to factor in all the money they invested in training
up their skill into their cost of the item, they are auctioning.

That all being said.  A profit is a profit.

lets say  we are  discussing a item with a EQ price tag of 1000pp. 
lets say there is only a one chance in 10 of failure 
and lets say the ingrediants cost 500 p

I would say the actual cost of making that particular item today is
550.  Any thing over that is profit. (profit today)
 The money spent on training and learning the skill is spent. Its
gone.  

If a player was to offer lets say 700pp for this item the tradesman
should probably take it.  He is ahead 150.  Sure the long term cost is
greater and if he accepts lot of these 'deals' it may tough to ever
recover his traing costs .

Another thing is 4 deals at 700 is more profitable than one at 1000.
