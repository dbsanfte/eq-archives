When this discussion crops up in guild chat or pickup groups, the
disinterest in EQ2 tends to be resounding.

It seems to be partly the disincentive of losing all your characters and
partly a distrust that Sony will get it right, after the frequent botches
made with the original EQ.

Personally I'm not moving to EQ2 at any time. When the original servers
are shut down, I won't be switching to any other MMORPG.
