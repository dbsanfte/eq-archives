No matter your stance on the war brewing in Iraq, I think we all love
and are worried for our men in uniform. We all have friends who are
actively preparing to ship out and fight in Iraq (on and off EQ).

I don't want to sound like a moron of late, but, please remember these
people in your Prayers, on your mind, or share your feelings for them.
They are going to do a job, in a place they would not willingly go, to
deal with problems they had nothing to do with originally. If you
support actions in Iraq or not, the people who have to go and do this
work deserve our consideration.

Please, if you are shipping out, let your friends here know. I for one
will keep you all in my prayers, and will prepare a party when you
return!
