[ ... SBLive rant .. ]

It's still a very good card *hardware wise*. Creative, however, has always
been known to write pretty bad drivers. However, everquest is a game,
that somehow has implemented a lot of things very badly. Not a single
other game I own has any sound issues with my SBLive. And not a single
other 3D game slows down my GeForce cards as much as EQ does (Hell,
EQ is slow on a GeForce3!). It must be one of the worst 3D engines
currently existing. Let's see if that new DirectX8 engine they
release soon will fix any of that. Hopefully they also
adressed the soundproblems somehow. I don't think this slowness
is due to some online playing issue or anything .. I really
think it's a bad engine, but who knows, I might be wrong :)

(Imagine EQ using an unreal2 engine... :P )
