I was wearing work resist gear that has a pretty severe penalty to my snip
skill.

One of the key points in scientific inquiry is that you only change one
variable at a time.  You changed level and AC.  You have no way of knowing
whether or not they balanced eachother out.  You assumed they didn't, but
you can't prove it.  That pretty much invalidates the test.  When you're
fighting mobs, the difference in level between you and the mob has an
intrensic effect.  I think it's safe to say that there's a good chance it
goes the other way as well.  Remember, differences in levels affects things
like resists.  How can you say for sure that it doesn't affect melee?

Do you know that the defence skill is all that is affected by level?  I
think you're over simplifying Verant's byzantine combat system.

Noted, but also has absolutely no bearing on my point.

Correct.  In as much as level is held constant, I think it's safe to assume
that AC in this case had no effect on chance to hit.  As you pointed out in
WaterCat's post, AC in general may or may not have that effect, it's
difficult to say.  I do wish Verant would split the ratings back up.

Well, it's safe to assume that AC is based on -something-, so if it doesn't
affect the hit percentage, it will likely affect the damage done.
Otherwise, you may as well ignore AC all together.

Wouldn't advise drop transfering, either.

Alternate Advancement points are a much better way to stay eligible for Vox
and Naggy raids.

My disaggrement with your point is not over the value of AC (although, I
think it would be better to say that AC is not a precise stat, as opposed to
not a useful stat), but that your test fails to prove your point.  By not
holding level constant, you've introduced a second variable, which many
believe to have a real effect on melee combat.
