	You are limited to 1000 faction points above your base faction.  If that's
not enough to get you where you want to be, then you can't do it.

	It took my leezard Necro about 600 kills in the Warrens to make
Apprehensive; I then turned in a bunch of Kobald Molars and jumped to Amiable,
which is where you need to be to have your own key to Paineel.  400 or so of
those kills were after reaching Dubious...so basically, you've got a long way
to go before you can sell in Paineel or turn in molars for more faction.

	However, you can bank at Dubious -- so just pay a newbie to let you in.
Bind outside the city so you can gate yourself back out.
