After I posted that I thought back about that (it was years ago). I
think Wuoshi may have hit some giants with his AE while he was still
chasing me. That would aggro any giant he hit and begin a chain aggro
reaction as giant after giant assists.

However when I died Wuoshi was kicking the snot out of them. I don't
think he ever got into serious trouble even when inside the house
thingy with that big pack of giants. It certainly would not be a good
way to farm Wuoshi....
