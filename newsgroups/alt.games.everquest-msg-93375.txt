You could get to shar vahl with some help. If level 6 or over (so
corpse lasts) you may be able to make it on own with an sow and some
of the 10 plat vendor invis potions, if nothing else. Just remember to
bank them before you go to luclin since they might be hard for you to
buy there as a troll.

My shar vahl kitty shaman went to wc when luclin was first out (shar
vahl was too graphically lagged then, later they fixed Umbra/DPVS) and
recently returned at level 9. She had relocated to qeynos so ran to nk
spire with SOW then took it up. She got a bind from the soubinder in
shadow haven, then took off to try to make it through paludral. She
died fast in pal ( I thought with sow she could outrun stuff but got
beat down) She then found the gnome guy who sells 10 plat invis
potions in the far southwest area of the shorties. Since a kitty,
starting with racial sneak, she could sneak behind him to get indiff
faction to buy them.  She bough tlike 3 but one was enough to get her
back to her body and pull it to by the zone, then she looted and went
to Shar vahl. She found the soulbinder there and got bound by it.

Soulbinders, on new characters in far away places that binders don't
visit much, are a god send ;)

I mention shar vahl because its a newbie city, everyone starts at
indiff to it (even trolls), since vah shir can be warriors it has a
warrior trainer, etc. Otherwise on a new char you won't have anywhere
to get xp in Luclin.  Shar vahl itself (a newbie canyon area.. easy to
get lost and confused and dead in...), shadeweavers thicket and
hollowshade mooor are the newb areas. After hollowshade it goes to
paludral which is higher (I might have order on shadeweavers and
hollowshade reversed)
