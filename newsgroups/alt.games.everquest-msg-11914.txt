Bah.  I took my Rogue there at level 16, and was able to solo to 17 pretty
easily.   And a Rogue has a great deal more soloing problems than a Shaman.

In any event, 18 is fine for a group near the windmill area, and healers
rarely have a hard time finding one.   (finding a good group is a lot more
work though)

On most servers, yes, it is that bad.   Our guild generally refers to it as
the Lake of Ill Manners.  There are a lot of bad groups and bad players there,
but it's probablly always going to be very populated since it's one of the
very few places you can go in the 18 - 28 range and be assured of finding a
pickup group.   Most other places are either permacamped with no openings
(High Hold Keep) or BYOG, Bring Your Own Group (Mistmoore, Cazic Thule, Upper
Guk, Runneyeye, Solusek A, Splitpaw... etc)

Well, you'll find out where the other ~130 people are when you get into the
other areas...

I've never really fought in Warsilks.  I believe it's yet another BYOG zone.
