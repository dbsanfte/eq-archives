LOL! Monks get a magic kick at 4th level anyway, and I don't
think level 1-3 monks are going to be killing a whole lot of wisps.

Now the slippers are still good though, 1 more AC than just
regular cured silk ones, and the +2 agility don't suck.

Wow excellent news, and I just read that some of the pieces
are not trivial at 139. This is great news for those tailors
trying to raise their skill to do the Velious leather armors.

Listen! Hear that? Its the sound of 10,000 spiders all
shuddering all across Norrath. =)
