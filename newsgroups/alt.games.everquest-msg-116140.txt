They probably are reasonably happy.  Currently, when a new MMORPG starts,
the old MMORPGs *gain* subscribers.  E.g., Verant said in a recent interview
that they saw a jump in subscribers when DAoC came out.  I suspect AC and UO
saw a similar jump.  DAoC has continued to grow...they are now at about 200k
subscribers.  Luclin probably gave DAoC a boost.  The DAoC expansion late
this year will probably give EQ a boost.

I talked to a marketing person about this, and it is not as strange as it
sounds.  The promotion and publicity surrounding a new game also raises
interest in the market as a whole, not just the market for that particular
game.  When the market reaches a point where a game has to get most of its
subscribers by taking them from other games, then you'd be worried if you
were Turbine and MS signed a deal with someone else, but in this stage of
the market, its not a problem.
