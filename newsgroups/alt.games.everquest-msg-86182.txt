I am not looking to purchase anything... due to the fact I am just at
about 1k in plat.  I am looking for suggestions in any way...  even
suggested raid gear for resists.
 I do have a great guild who is happy to help out on running to places
for drops or quests.....   most that would help me out are 50 plus... 
Any recommendations are appreciated and any particular pointers on the
location of the drop (i.e. spawn time, rarity, type of group to brin
etc...)
Presently my Wisdom is at 181, and none of my resists are above 40.
