This is the main reason I unsubscribed from EQ2. A huge
disappointment. That and the 'on-the-rails' aspect of the game, lack
of ability to visit any zone with all players of a certain level
bunched in the same zones. Hated it. 

Like many I remember my first run as a newbie in EQ from Qeynos to
Freeport. A magical, frightening, wonderous experience. Meeting mighty
adventurers along the way to aid me a little in my travels.  At least
WoW got this aspect right again to some extent and I know this is the
reason very many EQ2 players eventually went to WoW as I have.

Amen and agreed. However surely a large part of the reason this has
happened is the inability of the games companies to shut down IGE,
Yantis and their farming demon spawn? Now I'm not a lawyer but I know
that most of these companies are registered in Asia or other areas of
the world that make pursuing them all legally extremely difficult.

I can therefore see why a company is extremely pissed off that these
leeches are making a lot of money from their intellectual property and
not them. There is also the argument that if the game companies offer
these services on specialised servers it may help shut down the
illegal operations. Another factor is that these companies use almost
slave labour in the third world to farm for them. At least if SoE ran
it their employees would be getting a living wage.

I don't know the answer but it's obvious that nearly all MMORPG
companies have tried to go after IGE and their ilk but have had very
little success. I have noticed though since moving to WoW that
Blizzard seem, for some reason, to be doing a better job than most at
shutting farming accounts down. I've noticed a distinct fall in the
amount of gold available in WoW and thankfully IGE, Yantis etc have
had none for offer on my server at all for ages now, yipee!

I always smile when the idle sods say in chat 'how can I get more
money' and the whole zone replies 'try killing things ye lazy bugger'.
An old one, I know, but still good.

BB.
