I was thinking while making vulrich legs that all i was doing was pressing
keys 1,2,1,2,1,2, etc and occasionally throwing in a "3" if there was the
occasioanle event of the lightning type. It's dull. So how to fix it? I
personally don't know, but if SOE ran a competition to come up with an
improved system, then the players might come up with an idea. I think a
reward of a crafting station and a recipe of the player's name would be
good?

I feedbacked this and urge you to do this same if you agree, or if you have
a better way to increase the complexity and stump the botters of
tradeskilling, propose it here as well as feedbacking and i'll feedback your
idea too.
