I have no problem with you trying to sell a game. I have a problem
with you trying to sell your account, which is not only proof that you
can't keep to your agreements, but arguably illegal.

So does everyone who sells their accounts. There's also a "reserve
price". You can also cancel an auction before the close date. If you
weren't planning on closing the auction if the bids didn't exceed $60,
I'll eat my computer.

No, and you can't justify selling your account, either. Not even with
flimsy attempts to tell us you're selling the software and giving away
the account. Try to tell a cop "Hey, I'm just selling the ziplock
baggie, not the dope inside it..."
