Lot more fun when you kill a Bloodthirsty Ghoul with a throwing crit...

I always thought that if I did an Assassination on a throwing crit
the critter should explode or something...I mean, that's got to be one
HARD throw...
:-)

Are you insane?  Do you mean "If the rogue is dead for 3/4 of the raid?"
I love wizards, and think they definately can deal out some mean damage
with their Lure-based bane spells.  I think you might have meant "short
term," because long term damage the rogue just further and further out
paces every other class in damage as long as they're still alive (and I
don't
mean "attacking the critter's back," either...if the rogue is alive, he's at
the
critter's back un-aggro'd).  My backstab refreshes every 6-7 seconds or
so without a haste buff, and that's 400+ damage almost every time I poke.
Sometimes (pretty often, really) doubled.  With Ragebringer and a
Willsapper, I can usually dish out around 3400 dpm...and it'd be even
more disturbing if I could get my grubby hands on one of the Myrlokar's
15/19 daggers and off-hand my RB.

And as long as the rogue is still alive, he can do that _every_ minute,
without meditation time.  The med time is the killer for the wizard's dpm.
He may do more damage in 10 seconds than me, but I'll do more damage
more often all day long.

_Not_ including Assassination...
;-)
