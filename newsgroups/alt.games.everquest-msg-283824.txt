The mana buffs lowbie necro's can cast are lousy, and just won't give
any really helpful boost to anyone.  (I can't speak for higher level
ones, but you don't say what level this necro was, so...)  Answers?
Take Mana Potions if you don't have any mana buffs.  They stack with
beastlord "Spiritual" line of mana/hp buffs too, so get one of those.
Heck, why not make sure *everyone* takes along some healing potions -
they're so cheap it's like loose change (you can get IX and X's for 10
to 15 plat on my server, if you shop around and stock up).  They take
the load off clerics AND gives you help in an emergency situation.

I've fed the cleric mana on rare occasions, but can count on one hand
the times I've done it, well, up to lvl 37 anyway.

Necromancers are there to Fear, Slow, DoT (and Snare/Root if need be)
and do so much damage that frittering away time and mana on a crappy
mana-feeding spell is a waste of their time.  BUT, and I think this
may be what happened to you, the Necro should not just sit twiddling
their thumbs and send a tanked-up pet in to do their work.  They DO
need to use their spells as well, and some Necomancer's I have
encountered just don't get this concept.
