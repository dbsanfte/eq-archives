Didnt play AC for any length of time, so I cant comment. When I did
try when it first came out, I couldnt play it for any length of time
before my system would lock up, so I gave up (not bitching about them,
it was a personal system problem).

Well no, im not fine with the GM spam (as I noted). SOE will try to go
as far as they can.

My point was that people complain about paying for content. That some
people want everything for free, and thats just not realistic.

Yeah, I remember the days when you paid by the hour to play online
games. So the current business model is pretty damn good compared to
those old days.

So whats your solution to all of this? Stop making expansions and let
the game rot? Give content away for free? Nevermind it takes cash to
make these things. Never mind it takes bucks to run the game day to
day. Money to maintain all the servers etc.
