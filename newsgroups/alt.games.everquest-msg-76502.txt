If i recall correctly, pets generally do not get magical attacks (needed to
harm a wisp) until lvl 16 pet summoning spells.
Unless you can afford to give them magical weapons, wich would make their
attacks harm wisps. But that is a slightly expensive
exercise unless you are filthy rich and can afford it, or if you are a mage
that can summon weapons that do count as magical :))
