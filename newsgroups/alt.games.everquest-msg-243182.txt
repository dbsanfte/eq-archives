I have been told the same.  And nothing on track in there is light
blue.  Here's a better idea.  You have a Ranger.  Pull something with
low resists, such as a Kirokal (sp?--the mummies, whatever they are
called).  Ensnare it.  Now just regular-charm it and start doing 400
DPS.

Now instruct your sister as follows:
Make sure that your pet is tabbed.  In other words, target the chanter
pet, then target the pull.  Always make sure that you can hit the tab
key to target the charmed mob.  Keep tangling weeds up.  When charm
breaks (you can usually see it happen as the group window changes when
the pet meter disappears) hit tab and cast tangling weeds to get
aggro.  Ranger, take the hits if you have to, dont be a wuss.  The
idea is that now the Ranger can kite around an already-snared mob in a
circle so that you can re-charm it.

Perform maintenance.  Every ten minutes or so, hold pulls and tell the
Ranger to resnare the pet.  When she is ready, park your pet away from
you so that you have some time.  Ranger resnares.  Recharm it. 
Continue doing more DPS than any elemental-equiped melee could ever
dream of doing.

Oh and by the way, I have probably used 30 or 40 Fuligan Stones, seen
two enchanters get epic'ed and probably a hundred named die.  Still no
SEoC.  The drop rate on them is ridiculous.  Best of luck to your
sister, since you will be epic hasting your groups long before she
will be epic slowing anything.
