    Pretty varied, many of the spells look geared towards outdoors
activities - although at 49 you're still doing a lot of that. (Check out the
undead in Trak's Teeth, by the way - the Keepers should be quite easy to
solo, given resist gear.) I imagine GHeal comes in if you have any robes in
the party. You may wish to make both DA and Gate standard, or in situations
where Gating out is frowned upon DA and DB.

    You can tell I was raised in dungeons - just the MENTION of having fear
memmed makes my skin crawl. I've noticed I don't even like fear kiting with
my baby necromancer. ;-)

    Almost identical to mine. Paralyzing Earth, Cel Heal, Remedy, Holy
Might, Sound of Force, DA, Gate, Reckoning. My spells are less "evade and
scoot" than yours because at 58 many random mobs are targets of opportunity
rather than things to fear. That's why I have Sound in - to have nuke-type
spells at varied levels of damage, so I don't have to Reckoning a kodiak for
his pelt. I have a Totem of Faithful Prayers in main hand, so beating stuff
to death with my dolly isn't an option.

    I never drop DA for anything. If I get jumped by something massive, DA
gives me time to think instead of just react. In a dungeon setting, it's
great to survive the first few seconds of a bad overpull - although with the
detaunt on it now I feel guilty about casting it, and usually click it off
pretty fast.

    Immobilize is much better than Root for getting away. The faster cast
time means you can usually squeeze this off between swings from a mob. It
seemed to me, though, that it didn't hold as well as Root for root-nuking -
one nuke and the mob would almost always be after me again. My newest root,
Paralyzing Earth, seems to be like crazy glue when it comes to sticking a
mob someplace and having it stay there.

    This would be analogous to a raid selection of spells. Most raids I'm on
now there's no Gating out, so I'd always have DB up. But otherwise, modulo
higher-level replacements this is exactly my raid selection.

    For me, Word of Vigor is the "I don't want to live any more" spell. I
use it like you do, but I know once I use it I'm not sitting again for the
combat.

    If stunning is important, in case of resists. It also has a massive
knockback component that can be used when the tanks are being morons. ("Push
Fungi King in corner. Push Fungi King in corner. Push.... bah, I'll do it
myself.") In particular, I can rearrange mob configuation when a pet is on
it, which a tank cannot do. Out of doors, I use it as a 220-point nuke -
that means I waste less mana killing tiny things, as I can somewhat tailor
my damage output to their HPs.

    In group situations, this gets used on things that must be stunned
always and killed at the same time. Was it the Wyverns or the Drakes in CS
that had that Vox breath weapon proc when they hit stuff? With a few air
pets, a couple of clerics, a pally and an ENCH those things never got a
chance to proc.
