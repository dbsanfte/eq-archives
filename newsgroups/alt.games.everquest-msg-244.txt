If you were bored before, you will probably be bored again. They are
constantly tweaking and changing things to make the game more balanced and
enjoyable, but they aren't making any radical changes. Velious has lots of
cool new equipment, and a bunch of higher level zones, but really, Everquest
is the same game it was when Kunark came out. Here's a cut and paste from an
article posted by Brad today on http://eq.castersrealm.com/ detailing
changes to reduce downtime since EQ went live:

They also revamped and improved trade skills in recent months, and made some
changes to damage bonuses on slow weapons. The interface has been upgraded,
and new armour textures have been added. Useful and good changes? Sure. But
nothing is earth shattering, mechanics, objectives, methods are still pretty
much the same. I can't imagine any of the things they did would make a game
you felt was boring suddenly be exciting or fun. On the other hand, if you
do like it, they are very nice changes. The reasoning seems sound, they are
not about to totally redesign the game for players who don't like it and
risk alienating current customers. The changes they make are for the
hundreds of thousands of paying customers who are already fans.
