Well, as they said further down, as many times as you like until *all*
the customization options are in and finished... They can hardly expect
you to make a final decision about your face before they put in the code
for tinting your hair. :)

Me, I got it sorted. My Druid stays a redhead (goes with the Robe of
Living Fungus), my Necromancer gets white hair (perfect with the black
outfit) and my bard goes California blonde (to bring out the Lambent
armor).

This could be fun. :)
