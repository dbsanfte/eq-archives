Hi Llyric,

thanks for your post, I never saw the Battle Drummers Main Gauche
before and think thats a great item =)

Of the stringed items I have only seen one till now : Tear shaped ring
that drops in Drunder, Fortress of Zek ( and has really good stats ).

And to the second half of your post, sorry I never meant to have
people send the info directly to me =( Just change "send me" into
"post here" =)

I will try to get a complete list (searching through sites) and will
post it here as soon as i have it ready

Thanks again

Christian
