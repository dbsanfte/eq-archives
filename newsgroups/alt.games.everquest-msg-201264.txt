I haven't played since earlier this year but I was thinking of playing
again.  Has much changed in the past 4-5 months?  I have a 55 Monk and I
quit because it took too long to find groups.  I like 2 boxing in fact that
is what I did 99% of the time, but I dont really want to spend the $25 month
for both my accounts.

Thanks, Danny
