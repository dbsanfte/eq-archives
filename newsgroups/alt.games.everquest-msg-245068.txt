Ack, we're covered in meat!

}I'm up to lvl 26- maxed my hid-sneak-backstab skills.  For the life of

Weapon sounds fine.  As long as you have a mainhand weapon that's 
piercing, life is good.  What I'm not clear on is why you need a hotkey 
for this?  Perhaps you're thinking of some different kind of 'sneak 
attack'?  I just sneak, make sure sneak was successful (con a mob, verify 
that I'm moving slow), hide, walk around behind the mob, face the mob's 
butt, and mash backstab, and autoattack a teeny fraction of a second 
later.

At that level, even with backstab maxed, it's not going to hit every time.
