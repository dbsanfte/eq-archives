I don't see why we shouldn't be able to name our pets in the same manner 
that we currently choose a surname. With a /petname command we could 
choose a unique name which would be our character's pet's name for the 
entire life of our character. It would give a much more personal feel to 
our pets.

I also think a "/who petname" should respond with something similar to 
"PlayerX's pet" instead of responding with the standard "there is no 
character of this name" or whatever it is.
