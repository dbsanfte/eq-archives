The right way to do this is charge a fairly hefty fee ($50) per
character, so that they can afford to have someone look at each
proposed move, and decide on a case-by-case basis which equipment
you can take with you.  You apply, they tell you what you would be
allowed to take, and if you cancel, half the fee is returned.
