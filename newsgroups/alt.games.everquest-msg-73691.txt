Short version of question: What faction must you have with "Heretics" to
get the skelly guards in the Paineel newbie area to give you a damn key
to get in the city?

Details:
Last night our favorite Rogue was off doing something in the RL zone,
and we realized that we'd never bothered getting a key to the Hole,
since he'd always picked the lock for us. DOH! After some debate, we
decided that Tiru and I would go into the warrens and invest some time
smashing greenies to get enough faction for her to get a key, go into
the city, and buy a damn Hole Key for ourselves. Well, she started out
at "glaring" and I was WAAAAAY KOS. A couple hours later we had me at
dubious and her up to indifferent (checking at each step of the way) and
the fucking guards are STILL giving her the old "I don't think we trust
you enough yet....".

I'm willing to invest a bit more (reasonable amount) of time to obtain
the required faction and get the key, but if you have to be a damned
Ally or something, fuck it. We'll go to Velks. Anyone know for sure what
level of faction we need to get into Paineel?
