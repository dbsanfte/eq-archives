Hmmmmm. Not convinced. I just think that there are a lot of

(a)  newbies who seem to take an age to wake up to the fact that
no-one is going to give them free stuff. And

(b) lowbies who've seen newbies begging, and figure they'll get a cut
of the action as well.

Both groups seem to consist of immature little kids, who just can't
seem to grasp that it isn't like with your mom, where if you pester
hard enough you'll get what you want.
