so i got verbally abused the other day for looting a corpse, there wasn't
anyone around, oops they where way up on a hill, and despite the fact that i
offered to give it all back...

the gm said, though i did the right thing and that in the future i shouldn't
loot the corpses, even if there wasn't anyone visably around it...

try thinking about this...

the game deals with a corpse in three stages...
stage one : only the a person in the group who killed the mob can loot the
corpse
stage two : anyone can loot the corpse
stage three : the corpse rots, it's gone

if you killed it and you don't loot it until stage two then it's a free for
all.
if "you" don't like it then why is it possible ?
why did the programes put in that option ?

i know that there are times when it is difficult to loot something due to
other mobs BUT if you inform the intruder who loots the corpse in error and
they offer it all back to you, you should take it and b happy they
cooperated.

think of PC, i used to ask for permition to loot the corpses and they ALWAYS
said yes. i don't ask anymore cause i know they only want the coin cause
they are power leveling.

your thoughts please ;-)
