JAXXE
48th level Shaman
Quellious server

The invite I was looking forward to was tonight on Vox. I was minding my
business and got an invite - so I got from Luclin to Permafrost (with druid
help).

Not having time to print maps I decided to follow someone - he asked for an
invis and I noticed he was naked. a /who revealed he was LEVEL 1 !!! lol

Now im thinking - what is he doing - but he knew his way. until... his invis
wore off and goblins attacked im - I started nuking them - couldnt use JB
Bracer this time - needed some fast blasts but he was already dead. Then I
ran across another shaman who had about 2 bubbles of HP left. He conned
yellow so I assumed he knew what he was doing.

I JB'd the goblins off him that he was fighting and told him ill join him as
im raiding too. I followed him and realized he never healed HIMSELF !!!

well.. I invised him and myself and ran to the buff spot but before we got
there his invis wore off and goblins jumped him and a priest blasted him -
umm, they were all green but he had about 2 bubs of HP and started running.
Well.. that made a bigger train and im trying to pluck them off him...

Next thing you know I have about 8 casters on me - I laugh them off with my
over 100+ resistance then realize - I can not get there with all these fools
on me. They could barely hit me but teh casters got me down to 4 bubs life -
lol.

I decide... Hmmm.. beat all this trash and try to find my way there with no
map or gate... well.. gate won...

Maxed specialize ALT and max Channeling really helps - tons of gobs on me
and my gate goes off. After I zone the other person in my party says

"Did you die too?"

Hmmm... from now on - im taping maps to my wall! Bye Bye Vox !
