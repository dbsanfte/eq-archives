Ok, I'll admit I overstated it.  Not *everyone* with those specs is
having problems, apparently.  However, the fact that you are running
fine doesn't mean that there aren't lots of people who aren't.

And frankly, I find it difficult to believe that you are running "just
fine" in Luclin zones, when so many are experiencing massive slowdowns
there and it's known that there are programming problems in these
zones.

How much RAM do you have?
