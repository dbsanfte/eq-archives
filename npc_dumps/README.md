## Zone-NPC-List-Level.xlsx

This sheet is adapted from an original file found on www.eqic.net, which seems to have been put together by the original Hackersquest/ShowEQ guys from a range of zone captures taken between late November 1999 to January 2000.

While there are other zone dumps (ie, www.geocities.com/fictitiousname9), this source is notable for also having the counts of mobs in the zones, the only source I have found with this info.

I have added some formatting and included some extracts from the main sheet as extra sheets, including PC/NPC pets and their HP, since this has proven useful for figuring out how powerful pets were in classic.

## Geocities fictitiousname9 Dump

This dump seems to have been taken in the mid- to late-summer of 2000. It has Classic and Kunark zones only.

## eq_npcs_mar05.xls - Loreseekers EQ NPCs Sheet

This seems to be derived from the Zone-NPC-List-Level sheet. It looks like it has the same info, but without mob counts. It is dated Jan 28th 2000.
