## Zone-NPC-List-Level.xlsx

This sheet is adapted from an original file found on www.eqic.net, which seems to have been put together by the original Hackersquest/ShowEQ guys from a range of zone captures taken between late November 1999 to January 2000.

While there are other zone dumps (ie, www.geocities.com/fictitiousname9), this source is notable for also having the counts of mobs in the zones, the only source I have found with this info.

I have added some formatting and included some extracts from the main sheet as extra sheets, including PC/NPC pets and their HP, since this has proven useful for figuring out how powerful pets were in classic.
