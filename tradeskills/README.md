# Tradeskills

This folder contains interesting sheets and sources I've come across while browsing the archive that pertain to tradeskills in Classic EQ.

## Graffe's: EQ_Tradeskills_and_Research.xls

A spreadsheet I found hosted on Graffe's that contains very detailed info about EQ tradeskills as they existed in roughly 2001. 

The metadata on the spreadsheet says created in 1999, and the last modified date is 2001.
