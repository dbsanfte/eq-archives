## Checking out on Windows
I've noticed recently that there are several websites with filenames that Windows does not like, and git will fail to checkout on an NTFS filesystem. If you need to work with the repo, best to do it in Linux. If you want to work with the files on a Windows box, either use Windows Subsystem for Linux or download the raw zip instead.
