# eq-archives
Dolalin's assorted collection of old Everquest archive links and files.

See READMEs in various folders for more info.

## Checking out on Linux
Use git clone. As of Dec 2020 the archive can still be cloned on Linux as per usual.

## Checking out on Windows
If you want to work with the files on a Windows box, use Windows Subsystem for Linux. Many files have special chars (from their URLs / query strings) and the archive will NOT clone cleanly onto an NTFS file system. You have been warned.
