# eq-archives
Dolalin's assorted collection of old Everquest archive links and files.

See READMEs in various folders for more info.

## Searchability Coming Soon (again)
I am presently indexing the entire archive with Open Semantic Search (Apache Solr, basically). I will then clean up the index and make it publicly available. Apache Solr uses Lucene under the hood and supports rich, complex contextual queries, much like Google does. I will update this archive when that process is complete (it will take a few weeks..)

## Checking out on Linux
Use git clone. As of Dec 2020 the archive can still be cloned on Linux as per usual.

## Checking out on Windows
If you want to work with the files on a Windows box, use Windows Subsystem for Linux. Many files have special chars (from their URLs / query strings) and the archive will NOT clone cleanly onto an NTFS file system. You have been warned.
