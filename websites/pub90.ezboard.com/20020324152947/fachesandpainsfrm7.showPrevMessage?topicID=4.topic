I have sewn all my life and I can match colors with my eyes closed, but since the time with him, I always get that sick feeling in my stomach when I have to match colors now. Another is I simply cannot allow steel-toed shoes or boots in my environment, this is difficult since my husband is a mechanic and it serves him well to wear steel toe footwear -- the ex (again) drop kicked our 8 month old Yorkie pup into a wall because she had peed on the carpet, broke 3 ribs and he wouldn't let me take her to the vet.

I believe by not repeating the acts and striving to be better than our abusers we regain some control. It's kind of the old 'learn from it and move on' theory.

Anniversaries of the event can also trigger symptoms. People with PTSD also experience emotional numbness and sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, and irritability or outbursts of anger. Feelings of intense guilt are also common. Most people with PTSD try to avoid any reminders or thoughts of the ordeal. PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms last more than 1 month. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>I think I may carry some of its symptoms.  I do have flashbacks.  I cry.  I don't have nightmares, but I do have daydreams of being abused, which result to crying.  The anniversary of my rape causes me to stress out, such as not being close to people or just plain old irritablity.  The only thing that really BOTHERS me is when I got raped.  That sticks with me all the time.  Also, I was recently abused by someone, and I'm just stressing over everything.  I don't know.  Maybe this online support thing will help out?
