I guess it's worth a shot either way.<br><br>I've been struffling with annorexia for about 9 years now, in and out of hospitals, on and off medication, and to more therapists than you can shake a stick at.  I've had my times where I've eaten and everything seemed like it was going to be perfect again.  This might last for days, weeks even months!  But it always comes back.<br><br>I recently moved back to my home town and since I've been back, everything seems so beyond my reach!  I just can't seem to do much of anything right and it's affected my eating again.  I've lost a significant amount of weight in a fairly short time and so my family has desided to, once again, take control of this situation and make me abandon my apartment and come home with them.  Tonight, my parents sat me down for dinner and watched me eat until I thought I'd burst.  Then I did something I haven't even contemplated in years, I purged.  I just couldn't stand the thought of all of that fat growing inside of me, so I took a mixing bowl out of the cabinate and went down to the basement where I knew no one would hear or catch me and I rid myself of it all.<br><br>I know in my heart that this isn't going to help anything, and I can hear all of the statistics and side effects in my brain telling me that I can puncture my esophogas, or rot my teeth or a number of other things, but in some sick and twisted part of my psyche, I am actually proud that I did it.  I feel like I can beat the doctors and the therapists and my family.  They want to see me eat?  Fine, but they can't watch me digest.<br><br>I know I need help, and I'm getting help!  I'm in therapy, but I know that once the safe feeling of anonymity is lifted from me I'll lie as much as I have to in order to keep my secret.  Something like this is my only relief, somewhere I can finally unburden myself with these secrets without the fear of a lecture, or forsed feeding or any such threats.  I can only cross my fingers and hope... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=f5fff9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub90.ezboard.com/uvaluable.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valuable</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#000000>(1/22/02 9:00:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub90.ezboard.com/fachesandpainsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Looks like I'm the first...</span><hr size=1> <br>Dear Deja:<br><br>No deaf ears here.

My mother was obese, genetically predisposed to such. My father often &quot;joked&quot; about my mother's weight, calling her a &quot;lard ass,&quot; &quot;fatty,&quot; and myriad other names. He would &quot;tease&quot; her when she went on diets by bringing home junk foods, and saying &quot;Want a second helping?&quot; at dinner time. He also called me chubby on a regular basis. I swore to myself if I ever got thin, I would never put the weight back on, because NO ONE would ever talk to me the way he did about my weight, and NO ONE would ever talk to me the way he did to Mom because I would never ever ever become obese.<br><br>Top it with my thinner and older sister always ridiculing me about being small chested (still am) and as a child and young teen, taunting me because I was plain looking.<br><br>When I was 15, I had my first and only child (I brag about having several boys, but I gave birth to only this one). The pregancy was very difficult toward the end. I had toxemia and was hospitalized for a time prior to my son's delivery. All the pregnancy weight gain came off PLUS LOTS more before I ever left the hospital. When I became pregnant, I weighed about 115 pounds; I left the hospital weighing in at 103! Without trying the weight just slid off...and continued to do so when I went home. I eventually ended up weighing a mere 93 pounds without trying. <br><br>Then it hit me--I would never ever put that weight back on. Slowly, I noticed a change in my eating habits. Less and less food kept me skinny as hell, it also took away my father's and sister's tormenting. Instead, they then found me too THIN. But to me, that was far far better than being &quot;fat.&quot;<br><br>For many years my weight shifted between 93 and 100 pounds. As I inched closer to the heavier weights, I binged and purged, then avoided food altogether, then binged and purged...and so on. And NO ONE ever said a damn to word to me about it (except my doctors), until after I started manintaining a weight closer to 100. (By then I was 29 years old.)  The message I received: so long as your thin, we accept you. (But sister still taunted me about my breast size--and still does--I'm now almost 32; you'd think she'd grow up, huh?)<br><br>At 29--actually about a month before my 29th birthday--I sustained a serious back injury (STILL recovering) and was left quite inactive, and the weight started coming back. I began maintaining a weight at 100 - 104, and my doctors were elated. I, on the other hand, have felt like pure garbage. I now weigh 110 (am now 32--well, will be next month)and feel like the whales' brother. (I'm five-foot and one-and-1/4 inches tall.) I struggle with every piece of food that passes my lips, struggle to not binge and purge, struggle to not starve myself, every damned day.<br><br>I often smoke a lot to keep from eating (and also to keep my emotions from surfacing too much) and drink plenty of coffee (decaf, because I also have Panic Disorder). Like you, I know these behaviors are unhealthy, but I can not stop it. Part of me doesn't want to stop it. I want to take off every pound I've regained.<br><br>Unlike you, I do not engage in therapy very often. I can not stand to feel negative emotions, which always seem to roil to the surface when I'm in therapy. Not to mention I have a possibly warped view of therapists, counselors, psychologists, et. al.: Why pay someone to ACT like they care about you? Why pay someone to ACT like they are your &quot;friend&quot;? Real friends call you and spend time with you OUTSIDE of an office setting. Real friends come over and play cards, invite you to dinner, hang out with you. I know a counselor isn't supposed to be your &quot;friend&quot; persé, but it matters not to me that I know this. (Much comes into play here for me, as you can well see.)<br><br>Fortunately, Dad and I now have a much better relationship. Mom and Dad divorced in 1989, but are now friends and neither ridicules the other any more about anything. Sister and I no longer speak. I cut ties with her completely just recently. Sister is now very fat! And I fnd it very amusing!<br><br>I guess I'm sharing my story with you so that you know you are not alone in this struggle, so that you know you can come to this safe haven and have ppl around you who truly understand...to have ppl about you who love you no matter what.<br><br>Best always,<br>--Breezy <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=f5fff9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub90.ezboard.com/uemmajeanne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emma Jeanne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Friendly Shoulder</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#000000>(1/25/02 5:30:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub90.ezboard.com/fachesandpainsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Looks like I'm the first...</span><hr size=1> First to post but not alone. <br><br>Just like alcoholism, its a &quot;forever&quot; disease a constant struggle.<br><br>I learned how to be bulimic, believe it or not, from a television show designed to teach girls how bad it is for you! I told myself, no problem, I'll just lose a few pounds and quit. Uh uh. too addictive.  I feel physically good after vomiting.  The serotonin  rush I suppose. I am not emeshed the cycle anymore,I only fall back into it a few times a year. I am struggling to quit smoking right now and I know from experience I go right back into puking each time I try to quit. This time I confessed to my mom about why I haven't quit smoking after so many attemps. I have that in the back of  my head as I head into the last two weeks of the nicotene patch. I gave up the binge/purge cycle by taking up smoking. Now I have nothing to become addicted to when I give up smoking. sigh. its always been one trade-off or another<br><br>I was a fat kid and teenager. I lost weight and suddenly boys were paying attention to me. I assumed it was due to the weight loss, maybe it was a change in my personality, I'll never know. I was angry at their sudden interest after ignoring me as a fatso. <br><br>there are no easy answers. there are no easy cures. I struggled for many years with this. I will struggle forever to keep it in control. There is no such thing as &quot;just one piece&quot; it has to be all or nothing. <br><br>Long after I ended the binge/purge pattern, I still had emotional problems.
