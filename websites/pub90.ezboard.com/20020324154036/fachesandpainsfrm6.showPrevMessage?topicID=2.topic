Anger is a very normal reaction to what you're coping with: the house, the bills, the vet needs, your mother--all very real and very painful challenges.<br><br>I can't offer you any worthwhile advice, but I can tell you that even though you may feel alone, you aren't alone. I can tell you that you have the right to each and every one of your feelings. I can tell you I understand, and mean it. (I lost everything after a serious back injury three years ago--my job, my own business, my savings, CDs, new house fund, my son's college education fund and on and on--and I am now on temporary disabilty until I heal [no idea how much longer that is going to take but doc's say it'll be a long while yet] and FIA for my son. My sister is much like your mother, except she doesn't even know she is sick, which is VERY sick. I won't go into all the details of these issues because this is not about me right now, it's about you, and that's where we need to stay focused in this thread--on you.) I can tellyou that even though I do not know you, I care about you and I understand and feel your pain and anguish. <br><br>I could tell you it will get better in time, but I won't. When we go through challenges, we all already know it'll <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> eventually</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> improve; that isn't the obstacle; it's the &quot;getting through it&quot; that is so damned difficult. I know I can be nothing more than a listening ear for you, but please know that I do it with open arms.<br><br>I can offer one bit of possible help regarding the cold house: call your local energy company and ask if they participate in any &quot;Free Weatherization&quot; programs. If so, make an appointment to have them come out. They can put plastic on your windows, insulate piping, place weather strips along your door lips and more, all for free. Once they come through, call your local community services and ask the same question. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Then whatever windows and door you may have left, you can hop over to your local major market and invest in the rest of the plastic and weather strips which you need. (They are pretty cheap, but if you can't afford the &quot;extra&quot; coverage, at least you'll have something--hopefully--from a local program/service. Believe me, the plastic makes a HUGE difference. I didn't think it would, but I was convinced to try it and I was pleasantly surprised!)<br><br>OK. I guess I have more potential advice than I thought, because I just thought of something else. My doctors won't let me work; my back can't handle it anyway. I can't even use the computer for long before I must go lay down; but anyway, I was able to secure at least a paper route--yep, that's right: a paper route (no one else would hire me without a dr's release and the doc's aren't budging--understandably so). My son and I do the route every morning before he heads off to school, and although it is not big money, even less once we split the check, it does help. (It's only my son and I; I'm not married or even dating. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.actioninternet.net/users/pets/kitty/kittty99.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Every little bit makes a tremendous difference when you're as broke as you and I are.
