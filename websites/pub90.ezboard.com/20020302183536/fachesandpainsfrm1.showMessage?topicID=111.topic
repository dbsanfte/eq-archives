It is a perfectly good computer, that happens to be outdated and have a bad program.  It just needs program repairs.  I told him I was keeping just to see if I could repair it.  Just to see if I could.<br>Then I began telling him what I have found out about it so far...he told me straight to my face that he didn't believe any of it, and wouldn't until he had researched himself.<br>That's for the support, my dear life companion!<br>I told him that my main problem was that my Java was faulty, therefore I couldn't access some web sites or chat rooms.<br>He said that couldn't be true because WebTV and MacIntosh (sp) don't require Java.  My computer is neither of those.<br><br>Yesterday Bill had a friend from out of town, who he hasn't seen for years come by, then they went for lunch.  I asked him if he would be late (not that he needs my permission, I'm not his mommy...)<br>He said no.  His friend was staying with his mother and his 2 year old was there.  He said he would probably be home around 9pm.  (Long lunch.)<br>He got home at 2am.<br>You think he could call to say I'm late...and I'll be later.<br>No...asking him to show any sort of common curtisy is an infringment on his privacy and personal space.<br><br>Today I cleaned a house.  The woman I work for is soooo picky.  But she pays well and she's really nice.  She always apologize for being so picky.  She always leaves a long list of things she wants done, and the not always starts with &quot;Hello, how are you today <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot; and ends with &quot;Sorry to be so difficult, and I really love your work.&quot;<br>The way I see it...no one comes in my home and tells me how I can or can't have things done...so I'm not telling her no.  It's her home and she pays.<br>She has 2100sq ft, two stories, 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 3 teenagers, and 2 indoor dogs.  (Her dogs are so sweet.  Trixy and Bailey.)<br>Her down stairs is all tile and she wants all the furniture slide aside and the entire floor hand washed.  She wants all her all her dishes done, her laundry done, her wood polished, her plants washed, her walls swept (she has a dust allergy), and her windows done inside and out.<br>We (two of us) stay 5 hours and she gives us lunch, constant cold drinks, and music to listen to.<br>She pays through the nose for the service, and she is my favorite client because sh is so nice.  Her house is happy and warm (dispite the three teens) and always so emotionally light.<br>Anyway...<br>We finshed 10 mintues early and were sitting in the driveway waiting for the dryer to finish.  The next door neighbor came over and was talking about the car we came in.  A 90 Camero IRoc (Not my car).  He tells the girl I'm with to lift the hood so he can see the engine.  As he leans around her to look at the engine, he suddenly grabs her boob.<br>She nailed him in the ribs with her elbow and made him choke.  Then he walked up to me and grabbed my shirt and started pulling at it.<br>(What is with this creep?)<br>He had my foot print on his kneecap at the same time my other girls elbow landed in his throat.<br>He scampered off pretty hurt, but he lives right next door.<br><br>We went back in the house to decide what to do.  Do we want to call the cops and stir the pot and possibly loose the job, or do we want to send the man of the house over to have a chat with this creep?<br>Screw the job and call the cops!  That's my vote.<br>But both the woman we work for and the girl I work with believe we put a serious scare in him, so it should be ok.  Besides...he has brusies, we don't...it's his word against ours if the cops get called.  The evidence is on his side.<br>Oh Joy!!<br><br>Then I get home...all I wanna do is take a bath and get going on my book.  My deadline is April 2 and I still have so much work to do.<br>But No!!<br>Bill is at his parents and he wants me to have dinner there.<br>damn...I hate his mom and the feeling is mutual.<br>Then he tells me that he never fed the dogs.<br>That really pissed me off.  They eat first thing in the morning.<br><br>When I first got my dog, 7 years ago, I put him on the same scedual as my cats were on.  Dry food in the morning, 1/2 can wet food at night.  The dry food is left out, so he can free feed all day.<br>Well, when I moved in with Bill, he changed the schedual to all food in the morning...just cuz his parents did it that way.<br>I agreed because his dog is older.  If my dog was older...I wouldn't have let him change it...but it's just easier to feed both dogs at the same time.<br><br>Well...his daddy told him today that the vet said it was better to feed dogs at night.  I don't know how true this is, and frankly I don't care.<br>So, without discussing it with me, he switched the schedual back to dry food in the morning, wet food at night.  He did this by making the dogs go 36 hours without food.<br><br>I was soooo pissed!<br>Then he told me to just give them a bone and head to his mom's house!<br>Screw you!!!  I fed the friggin' dogs!!<br><br>So off to dinner with Bill parents...<br>The menu (and don't forget that his mom has been having me over for 7 years...):<br>Veal (Not only do I not eat meat...but veal makes me want to kill someone...ethics and all!)<br>Green Beans with blue cheese sauce.  (I'm allergic to mold in all forms...even penicillian.)<br>Fruit Salad (I have low blood sugar and can't eat fruit...too much sugar.)<br>Green salad with Raspberrie dressing (I still can't eat fruit...)<br>Rolls.<br><br>I had Bread for dinner.<br><br>Then after dinner she is asking me about my blood sugar...then offers me a peice of chocolate.<br><br>Then I say that I want to split cuz I need to get back to work on my book, my deadline is coming up...<br>Wow!  What deadline?<br>The deadline I told myself that I want my book in the mail by.<br>So it isn't a REAL deadline...<br><br>Then, when Bill finally gets home...I walk up to give him a hug.  He pushes me away and says &quot;Geez...why does everything always have to be about sex?&quot;<br><br>It was a damn hug!<br>Any one who has known me for more then a year, knows I have a serious problem with touching.  I hate it.  I can't stand people touching me.  Sometimes it is real mental work to reach out to him...and he pushed me away.<br><br>And sex?<br>I've had an infection for over 6 weeks now.  Sex isn't a subject in this house right now...<br><br>I'm gonna blow!!<br>Thank god he goes back to work Saturday night!<br><br> <p><a href=http://pub90.ezboard.com/bachesandpains>The Support Lounge</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=f5fff9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub90.ezboard.com/udavidpadgham.showPublicProfile?language=EN>David Padgham </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Friendly Shoulder</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#000000>(2/22/02 1:24:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub90.ezboard.com/fachesandpainsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=111.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://shimaspa.hypermart.net/ib3/iB_html/non-cgi/avatars/do_not_use_0016.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm fried and I'm gonna blow!!</span><hr size=1> (((((Kittty)))))<br><br>I wish I could think of something helpful to say, but I'm useless at this stuff...
