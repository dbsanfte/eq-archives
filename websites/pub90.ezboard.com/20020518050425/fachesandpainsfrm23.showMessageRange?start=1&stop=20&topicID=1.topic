(This is not intended to spark debates, but is a matter of curiosity.)<br>~~I guess I consider myself agnostic.  As I get older sometimes I feel a need for some type of spiritual belief... something more than just the physical reality. I like the Buddhist ideas, the eastern ideas... I want to beleive in some kind of higher power, but I can't bring myself to believe in a god... if there is a god, he is either powerless to make the suffering in this world better, or he's cruel because he doesn't do anything about it.<br><br>Were these beliefs instilled in your &quot;coming up&quot; years, or at another time in your life?<br>~~My parents both are Lutheran, and I was baptised Lutheran and attended church occasionally.

About others?<br>~~I like that I have the ability to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> see</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> what is going on. So many people, it seems, are unable to see their own life patterns, their destructive tendencies.. I like to think I have an open mind and I'm able to see many of my faults.  I'm sure there are more out there that I can't see but hopefully will in the future.  I also value this in others.  It's a shocking, sometimes unbearable thing, to really see ones-self. I value it highly.  I am very surprised and interested in how people cannot see themselves. I don't blame them, or think less of them in any way, I think there are reasons for it.  The denial defense mechanism is so very strong, it fascinates me.  Many of my own I am not yet able to do anything about... that is also a difficult thing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>=========<br><br>What are your outstanding attributes?
