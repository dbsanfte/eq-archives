I just wanted to start up a post that I had on the old GD website.  We have a few new people and I would like to open this up for everyone =).  I always find it curious and entertaining to look at people's name whether their in Greater Druids or not and wonder how in the world they came up with it.  And that is what this post is about . . .  how did you come up with your name (Main or Alt).<br>
My main is Chantarra.  She has no last name as of yet because I cannot think of one that I like that goes well with Chantarra.  I thought up this name before I started playing EQ, before I knew that enchanters existed in the game let alone that they were knick-named chanters hehe.  My then boyfriend (now Husband) Crusadis wanted me to get into playing EQ and he told me of a few different classes, one of them being the bard.  At first I had planned to start a bard and I wanted the name to be related to singing.  So I was choosing between play offs of the french word &quot;to sing&quot; - chanter, and the spanish word &quot;to sing&quot; - canter.  I thought either Chantarra or Cantarra, for a bard.  I asked Cru which he liked, he liked Chantarra and so that is what I picked.  But it turned out that I started a cleric instead and I really liked that name so I used it for her.<br>
Reephe (warrior) - I had received an email from a friend on how to create your own star wars name.  Something along the lines of taking the first 3 letters of your last name, combine it with the first 2 letters of your first name, etc etc.  Well Rieph was what I had come up with.  EQ didn't accept that spelling however so when it got down to it it finally accepted Reephe.<br>
Wayway Faraway (druid) - just a neat little name I really wanted to give a druid hehe.<br>
Muzique (bard) - French word for music with the z in place of an s.<br>
Myrgle (shaman who is as of yet too low to join the guild but will be joining soon) - If you've ever hunted the goblins and have them say something like   - - - -ack myrgle doo, that is goblin for I hate you. That's where I got the myrgle from, and I thought it was a very fitting name for a frog, especially one as cute as Myrgle!  Her last name is going to be Mudthumper!  Myrgle Mudthumper.  And I wish we could have middle names in EQ, then her full name would be Myrgle TheGurgle Mudthumper III.  *sigh* yet another thing to suggest to SOE I guess ).<br>
My other characters have names that I just thought up for not really any particular reason, they just popped into my head and sounded cool hehe. =)<br>

The correct way to say my characters name is &quot;Zan-T-gwa&quot;. I came up with that name back in 1984 when I was going to High school. At the time I was a singer in a heavy metal band that went about as far as a flat tire on a unicycle, and I had the job of thinking of a name for our mascot. (I guess we liked Iron Madien way too much back then). I got off the bus and fell on some ice and hit my head HARD. It must of been something in my subconscious because the first thing I saw when my head hit was a white flash and that name. <br>
<br>
Back in the good 'ol days of the Apple IIe computers, I wrote an adventure game called &quot;Antagoras Revenge&quot; based off the D&amp;D concept. I used &quot;Xantequia&quot; in it as a super powerful devil/dragon thingie that was next to impossible to kill if my random number generator worked correctly. So both names stuck to me and I now use the two together as my characters name. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub107.ezboard.com/bgreaterdruidsweb.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dorfenholyblade>dorfenholyblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF9300>(8/28/03 7:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub107.ezboard.com/fgreaterdruidswebfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: What's in a Name?</span><hr size=1> Well I don't know where to start... I have a few characters I play regularly, but my main is Dorfen... don't ask me why, but I wanted to call him Dwarven Holyblade... like the EQ server would take that... (it didn't) so i tried Dorfen, and it took it so here he is... His last name changed to Trueshine when he met his wife (and hopefully there will be a ceremony) and decided that he needed to get a different last name, and I liked Trueshine better than Holyblade :P Just has that ring to it...<br>
<br>
Spudnik on the other hand... now that is a story... He was named after a D&amp;D character i had... was a dwarf fighter that took the tunnel fighter package, and used his fists and a great spear... but he had one love in life... BEER... if the players pissed him off, they knew to give him a beer and he was happy :P So that is where I came up with his name, although Spud doesn't drink in EQ... /shrug<br>
<br>
Anywho if ya wanna know more about either of those two, or any of my other toons, send me a tell in game :P<br>

<br>
I heard of EQ from a computer guru friend of mine in November '99. He asked me to come over and check out this &quot;Very cool&quot; online game. I didn't have a PC at the time, and my friend was a self-proclaimed Power-user.....So I go over and check it all out. He was attending an in-game wedding at the entrance to Kaladim. I peeked a bit close and thought, 'Hmm, neat.' Kind of indifferent to it, coming from FPS and Strategy games with some action......Then he points to the Chars on screen and says, &quot;Those are other people, around the world.&quot; I was dumbfounded. <br>
<br>
I finally got a PC of my own in Sept 2000 and got 'chat syndrome'. My friend keeps bugging me to get EQ. I gave in, invited him over and we installed it. Then he says, &quot;You have to pick a name.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crusadis - I am a fan of Indiana Jones movies and always thought The Last Crusade was the best one. Liking the sound of Crusade I toyed with different spellings and what not......<br>
<br>
Zilendar - Kind of a name that grew on me.....One of my old friends, a drummer, swore my Zildjian cymbals. Heh, even named his first-born son after them......I liked the name but got rejected as that spelling. Then rejected every spelling I came up with thereafter except Zilendar. It's not what I really wanted, but like I said it grew on me<br>
<br>
Muvyn - Crusadis is venturing about in Butcherblock mountains at level 14, going after his Scarab Breastplate near the GFay zone when in trots this level 50 Bard. Kunark had just launched and traffic in BB was heavy. This Bard was a human and couldn't see well and asked for my assistance reaching the docks. I agreed to help him and clicked 'FOLLOW'. I asked if he was ready, and at his response began to run........boy, did I EVER run. I shared my exclaimed sentiment with the Bard, asking what made me so fast. He chuckled and told me Bard song does that. I vowed to one day make a Bard that lived up to my experience that day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub107.ezboard.com/bgreaterdruidsweb.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ginieniel>Ginieniel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF9300>(10/2/03 6:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub107.ezboard.com/fgreaterdruidswebfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: What's in a Name?</span><hr size=1> Back in my high school days I read Tolkien's trilogy about 16 times LOL. I really wanted to go off on an adventure with the fellowship!! <br>
<br>
So I really wanted an elvish sounding name for my woodelf. I ran thru a bunch on the random generator until I found Ginienial. She was born high on a platform in Kelethin with a view screen that seemed full of a tree so I took one step backwards. Never found the corpse. Lost my book etc. Lost whatever it is you are supposed to hand in to the guild master. So, at level 3 someone told me to restart her. So I did as Ginieniel. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I wanted to make my alts easy to find for my friends so I started Lini and Zini to go with Gini. But...I did not necessarily want them easy to spell LOL! I used the lost 'a' from Ginienial in my Lini...hence the Linilianiel and then came Zinizerena <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

hmmm LOL forgot about my very first char, someone told me to start a wizzie so I did. Her name was random generator. She is my trade mule now and was at level 5 for several years until I finally moved her to RV and brought her up to level 11 LOL!

Second char was Dwarf Pally named Jykl.  He also has faded, but his siblings remain Jykkl or Jykll (one on TP 37 cler, one on Quellious, 1 pally) <br>

Gekosan, who's about my 30th char, well honestly I was tired of thinking names so I started a little theme where first part of the name indicated race followed by &quot;san&quot; which is kinda like Mr. Geko is a sound that frogs make, so Gekosan.  I also have a Gatosan on TP (46 shammy Vah Shir) and Saposan (16 cler on Quellious but will never be played) <br>

after my first two (and a half) chars Qwimm Jykl Qwymm,  I also went on a bit of a culture kick.  The first char on Quellious I made was named Aquilas.  Came from Aguila, which is eagle in Spanish.  My fourth char was somewhat random Izuki (a cross of a name of a twon in Japan and name of a relative)  My beastlord Ojitarian is off a slang in Japanese.  Name Kardell is off a town in Mexico, Zhenine is off a name of a city in China, Sebatien is off a name of a city in Spain (San Sebastian) Got a beastlord Tiburos which is basically shark in spanish.  <br>
