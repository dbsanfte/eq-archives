A Children's Story for Samhain:</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>The night was very dark, with a
Full Moon hanging in the cloud-filled sky above. The air was crisp with the feel
of late autumn and the doorway between the worlds was wide open. Carved pumpkins
sat on the porches of the houses in the little town, and the laughter of
children dressed in costumes could be heard from the streets. It was a sad time
for Beth as she climbed the little hill behind her house. In her arms was her
cat and friend Smoky, carefully wrapped in his favorite blanket. A little grave
was already dug on the hill, waiting, for Smoky had died that day. &quot;Do you
want me to go with you?&quot;; Beth's father had asked.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;I dug his grave beside
MacDougal's at the top of the hill.&quot;; Beth clearly remembered when their
dog MacDougal had died after being hit by a car. &quot;no, I want to go by
myself,&quot; she answered. Beth stopped at the top of the hill and knelt beside
the little grave. She carefully laid Smoky's blanket-wrapped form in the earth
and covered it with dirt, laying several large rocks on the top. Then she cried
and cried. &quot;Oh, Smoky, I miss you so much!&quot;; Beth looked up at the
Moon, tears streaming down her cheeks. &quot;Why did you die?; &quot;It was his
time to rejoin the mother,&quot;; said a deep, gentle voice in the darkness.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;Who said that?&quot;; Beth
looked around but saw no one.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;Dying is part of the cycle
of life, you know.&quot;; One of the boulders on the hill stirred into life.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;Who are you?&quot; The
moonlight shone down on the little woman, and Beth could see she was not human.
&quot;I'm a troll-wife,&quot; said the creature as she came to sit across from
Beth. &quot;This is a sad night for both of us, girl. I, too, came to this hill
to bury a friend.&quot; The troll-wife wiped a crystal tear from her cheek.
&quot;The squirrel was very old. Still it makes me sad.&quot; Beth stared at the
troll-wife. The little woman was the color of rock in the moonlight, her hair
like long strands of moss, her bright eyes like shining crystals. She wore a
dress woven of oak leaves and tree bark. &quot;The squirrel and I lived together
for a long time,&quot; the troll-wife said. &quot;We often talked to your cat
when he was hunting here on the hill. Smoky and I were friends. I shall miss
him, too. &quot;The little woman patted Smoky 's grave gently, &quot;Sleep well,
little friend. When you are rested, we shall talk together again.&quot;
&quot;But he's dead,&quot; Beth said, her voice choked with tears. &quot;Child,
this is Samhain. Don't you know the ancient secrets of this sacred time of
year&quot;; The troll-wife motioned for Beth to come and sit beside her.
&quot;It is true that our friends have gone into a world where we can no longer
physically touch them, but the Mother has given us other ways of communicating
with them. We can do this any time, but the time of Samhain is the easiest&quot;
&quot;I don't understand how this can be done, &quot;; Beth said&quot; or why
Samhain makes it easier,&quot;; &quot;At this time of year&quot; the troll-wife
answered, &quot;the walls between this world and the world of souls and spirits
are very thin. If we quiet and listen, we can hear our loved ones and they can
hear us. We talk, not with spoken words, but with the heart and mind&quot;
&quot;Isn't that just imagination?&quot;; Beth looked down at Smoky's grave,
tears once more coming into her eyes. &quot;Like my thinking I can feel
MacDougal get up on my bed at night like he used to?&quot;; &quot;Sometimes it
is, but mostly it is not imagination, only our friends come to see us in their
spirit bodies&quot;; The troll-wife reached up her hand and patted something
Beth couldn't see on her shoulder. &quot;Like my friend the raven. He is here
now.&quot;</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Beth looked hard and saw a thin
form of hazy moonlight on the troll-wife's shoulder. &quot;I've seen something
like that at the foot of my bed where MacDougal used to sleep.&quot; She
whispered.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot; I thought I was
dreaming.&quot; She jumped as something nudged her arm. When she looked down,
nothing was there. The troll-wife smiled. &quot;Close your eyes and think of
MacDougal,&quot; she said. &quot;He has been waiting a long time for you to see
him.&quot; Beth closed her eyes and, at once, the form of her little dog came
into her mind. His tail wagged with happiness. She felt a wave of love come from
him, and she sent her love back. Then she felt the dog lie down against her leg.
&quot;Can I do this with Smoky?&quot; Beth asked.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;Not yet,&quot; the
troll-wife answered. &quot; He needs to sleep a while and rest. Then he will
come to you. This gives Smoky time to adjust to his new world, and you time to
grieve for him. It is not wrong to grieve, but we must not grieve forever.&quot;</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;I never thought of it that
way,&quot; Beth said. &quot;It's kind of like they moved away, and we can only
talk to them on the phone.&quot;</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;It is this way with all
creatures, not just animals.&quot;</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>The troll-wife stood up and held
out a hand to Beth. &quot;Will you join me, human girl? Although I buried my
friend squirrel this night, I still must dance and sing to all my friends and
ancestors who have gone on their journey into the other world. For this is a
time to honor the ancestors.&quot; Beth joined the troll-wife in the ancient
slow troll dances around the top of the little hill in the moonlight. She
watched quietly while the troll-wife called out troll-words to the four
directions, words Beth couldn't understand. Deep in her heart the girl felt the
power of the strange words and knew they were given in honor and love by the
little troll-wife. When the troll-wife was finished with her ritual, she hugged
Beth. &quot;Go in peace, human child,&quot; she said. &quot;And remember what I
have told you about the ancient secret of Samhain.&quot; &quot;I will,&quot;
Beth answered. &quot;Will I ever see you again?&quot; &quot;Whenever the Moon is
Full, I will be here,&quot; the little troll-wife said. &quot;And especially at
Samhain.&quot; &quot;I wish I had something to give you.&quot; Beth hugged the
little woman.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;You have taught me so
much.&quot; She felt the tears come to her eyes again. &quot;Let us exchange
tears for our lost friends.&quot; The troll-wife reached up a rough finder and
caught a tear as it fell from Beth's eye. The tear glistened on her finger. The
troll-wife gently touched her finger to her cloak, and Beth's tear shone there
like a diamond in the moonlight.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Beth reached up carefully and
caught one of the troll-wife's tears as it slid down her rough cheek. It turned
into a real crystal in her hand. &quot;Remember the secret of Samhain, and
remember me,&quot; the troll-wife said softly as she disappeared into the
darkness. Beth walked back down the hill, the crystal clutched in her hand. Her
father was waiting for her on the porch. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; her
father asked as he gave Beth a hug.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;I will be,&quot; she
answered. She opened her hand under the porch light and saw a perfect,
tear-shaped crystal lying there.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;Did you find
something?&quot; her father asked.</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>&quot;troll-tear&quot; Beth
answered, and her father smiled. For he also knew the little troll-wife and the
secret of Samhain.</b></font></p>
