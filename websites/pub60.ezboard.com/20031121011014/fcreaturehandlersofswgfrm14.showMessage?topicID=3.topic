<br>
&quot;This'll be easy, just a big hitting paralope&quot;. My thoughts where based on no true experience with aggro creatures or Endor. It was time to start learning.<br>
<br>
I ran a few missions with friends, learnt my way around both the outposts, died a lot at the start and saw a few adults critters I wanted. It was time to hook into the baby hunting. <br>
<br>
The first jaunt was a run from the Smuggler outpost to the Research outpost checking everything out. I run from everything, put my weapon away, stop/wait for my radar to catch up with the mobs when spotting lairs and use maskscent breaking as a good early warning device. Arachne mobs all over the place and not a lot or Merek/Boar Wolf action. Spotted a baby Bloodseeker mite. My first target for the day. The slow walk in worked and maskscent held it was a good start. I was half way across a river with the critter under me. /tame and BANG, first go got myself a Bloodmite. Well this is a piece of cake. Time to keep going.<br>
<br>
4km from the research outpost I spot a heap of Boar Pigs. Sneaking around a stretched group of 5 I spot a baby Boar Pig, not exactly what I wanted but it's a start. Sneak in, sucess. Maskscent, sucess. /Tame, fail,fail,fail, he gets the shits up. I ran straight out and got no extra attention and he just left me alone in the end. Time to head back in. Only one more fail and I got me a pigdog. &quot;Well this is all going good&quot;.<br>
<br>
Another 2km along I find a group of 10-12 Boar Wolves spread out alone a ridge. &quot;There&quot; got a Boar Wolf Ravanger Baby in my sights. This is all going great. Sneak in, sucess. Maskscent, sucess. /Tame, fail,fail,fail,fail,fail,fail,fail,fail  . . . come one what's going on here. BANG I made him mad . . . it went from bad to worse in a big way. 4 adults were on quicker than you could say &quot;Big Baldy Badger&quot;. I was dead even faster with the suckers running faster than burst run.<br>
<br>
This is not going to stop me. The next 4 days where spent running around, looking, dieing, loosing hope. Running out from the outpost in all directions I found them to the NE and SW of the base all the time. Then just before the servers went down I spotted him (5 min to server drop). A group of 3, Adult ravager, adult boar wolf and a baby ravager. This is it.<br>
<br>
Snuck in and got into taming range. First try BANG, he was into me for failing to tame. Ran off without burst run and bubby was the only one on my heels hitting for 10-30. Once he broke off the attack I was straight back in once maskscent was up. He wandered all the way back to the group so another tricky one. All went well until he got upset with me failing the tame. This time the Boar Wolf adult came with him. I layed there flat on my back after a very brief run staring at the stars praying the server didn't drop. <br>
<br>
Back in, 100 health, no time to heal up. While I snuck back in I slipped into a run and sprinted right up to him. Maskscent held and I was cursing my hotkeys. /Tame, BANG, I now have a Boar Wolf Ravager. Check the clock and was 30secs past the predicted server drop. <br>
<br>
Now for the Bloodstained Merek challenge tommorow.<br>

I go to Endor just about everyother day with a group of friends and usually at least a few random people to fill in.  I'm a 2,2,2,3 CH and wasn't expecting to get anything from endor except maybe an aged lantern bird.  But while our camp was made and everyone was healing I went out to scout the area, and lucky enough, there's a baby boar wolf about 100m from our camp, and he's even on the outside of the pack so I won't have to put up with all the others.  So I tell my group I'm going to catch him, I'll brb.<br>
I walk within 25-30m with maskscent on, go prone and just hit numlock and let myself crawl the rest of the way.  I get within 9m and hit Tame, it failed.  I try it again, it failed.  Again, failed.  I failed to catch a plain boar wolf baby about 7 times.  But, after putting in this much work, I'm not about to just crawl back away and leave.  As I'm right in the middle of about my eigth try I notice on my radar that about 4 green dots are moving towards me, it's my putz groupmates.  I shout &quot;IM TRYING TO TAME THIS, GET AWAY,&quot; they're still coming...  So I shout &quot;STOP GO BACK!&quot;  Nothing.  They get right up to about 8m behind me with no maskscent on, no camo, not prone, heck, not even walking up.  So of course the whole pack goes aggro.  I jump up and start running for the camp shooting suppressionfire the whole way there trying to give myself some distance till my friends can jump in and help my kill it (and hopefully send their creatures to distract it).  But instead, since I'm a carbineer, I miss about 6 times and my shot that does hit Fails to Change the Targets Posture.<br>
In the end it killed me, and only me.  Then they walked back to where they were and left the others alone.  What a great experience!  After that I left the group and headed back to Naboo.<br>
<br>
But I didn't know CHs with 2,2,0,0 could catch any mereks; I'll see you on Endor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bellor>Bellor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.webone.com.au/~bellor/Graphics/dancing.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#70DB93>(9/10/03 6:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webone.com.au/~bellor/Graphics/minibellmini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Finding my first pet after 2/2/0/0</span><hr size=1> Boodstained and Assasins . . .

I started wandering west from the smugglers outpost as that is the direction I usually find crowded with every type of creature and NPC imaginable on Endor.  Didn't find much so I started heading south, and there it was, a glorious bloodstained merek (baby), how lucky a find it was (probably the first baby one I had ever seen in my many, many trips to Endor).<br>
I started +shift walking towards it, masked my scent, and went prone about 30m out.  As I crawled towards it a creature noticed me and I had to sit tight about 17m away until I could remask.  I get my /maskscent back and move in for the /tame.  Once within 9m I attempt it, but it's not even before I can get to &quot;Good...err....boy?&quot; before it scampers away to the comfort of an adult, leaving me laying there out of range.  So I'm now forced to crawl closer and within easy reach of what is now 3 or 4 other mereks.  I /tame it again 2 or 3 times with no luck, then, with no reason (except maybe the 2 other guys about 20-25m away fighting something else), something detects me and I'm again left sitting there with no camouflage.  So I now lay there prone (in every sense of the word) and it's about 3 seconds before one of them aggros me and about .5 seconds after that that they kill me before I can even get to my feet and to /burstrun out of there.<br>
So now I'm wandering around Endor looking for another (with little luck).  At times I've found myself walking through the woods without spotting a single creature for about a half hour; ridiculous.  So maybe if you've been able to find a couple you could share any particularly good spots or areas.  I know I usually find mereks in the mountainous region around the Smuggler post, especially West and North but these spots seem to be dry.  So I'm still out there looking and refuse to leave till I find one.<br>
<br>
Anyway, good luck with your search, hope it goes better than mine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bellor>Bellor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.webone.com.au/~bellor/Graphics/dancing.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#70DB93>(9/17/03 6:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webone.com.au/~bellor/Graphics/minibellmini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Finding my first pet after 2/2/0/0</span><hr size=1> I find them around either outpost.

The Drifter appeared right after my friends and I blew up the lair (just popped out and since the lair was gone and not being attacked he didn't aggro).  One of my friend tried to catch him twice but failed and let me give it a try since he had so many better pets than I anyway.  I caught him in 3 tries and he, luckily, never aggrod me.<br>
<br>
I found the Mantrigue in amongst some adults and had to crawl in to get a chance.  Tried about 7 times to catch him, finally succeeded after about 4-5 aggros and running away and 2 deaths.<br>
<br>
Still looking for the elusive merek and starting to wonder if arachnes even spawn babies anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14.emailToFriend?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub60.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm10">SWG Discussion<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm7">Creature Handler Tips<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm8">Creature Challenge Levels<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm20">RANTS!<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm14">Creature Handler Stories<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm16">Our Bio-Engineer Friends!<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm18">Anything goes!<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm3">Polls<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm9">Nerf Herders<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm17">Link it!<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm13">Ch Hideout<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm19">Suggestions to impove this forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#70DB93>- </font><a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg>Creature Handlers of SWG</a><font color=#70DB93> - </font><a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm14>Creature Handler Stories</a> <font color=#70DB93> - </font><a href="Creature Handlers of SWG">Creature Handlers of SWG</a><font color=#70DB93> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
