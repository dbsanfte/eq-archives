Granted they should now (Chefs and Tailors) but not only is it broken but the appeal is just to two more advanced classes.<br>

Most crafters can sell thier items to either all players, or all players with certain base skill sets (i.e. WS sells to any Marksman and Brawler). <p>---------------------------------<br>

The real problem with BEs is the same problem that every other crafter has, which is the crafting process is broken and stats come out wrong.  Every BE pet I've seen has LOWER stats than their wild counterparts.  They need to up the stats on BE pets without lowering the stats on wild counterparts.  Taming wild pets is fun and way cooler than buying one in a store, so a BE made one should have something really special that can't be found in the wild.  Oh, and taking away stuff from the wild pets and giving them to BE pets doesn't count.  That would just make me and I suspect many other CHs resent BEs.  Yes, we'd HAVE to buy from BEs, but the idea here is for us to like it, too, if you want it to be fun for both sides. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hechicera>Hechicera</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#70DB93>(9/3/03 8:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Be's and Ch's</span><hr size=1> Like I said the dynamics that pit BEs vs CHs isn't good.

<br>
BEs didnt' ask for pet stims and I'd say over half hate the idea themselves.<br>
<br>
As far as bad BE pets go .. thats just due to bad BEs.  Imagine wild pets as equivalent to weapons made by a weaponsmith half-way through the tree.<br>
<br>
A Novice BE or one that doesn't grasp the DNA placing or go to 5 planets to search for then farm meats and organics (which resource runners rarely stock with good stats for BEs) will make crappy pets.  I see a LOT of crappy pets too.<br>
<br>
A good BE *can* make a pet thats better than a wild one.  The problems are:<br>
<br>
- its not a lot better<br>
<br>
- there are other wild pets that will be better in the same CL range<br>
<br>
- its a lot of fun to tame in the wild<br>
<br>
Right now the only reason to buy BE (assuming you find one that competently makes pets) is convenience.   Thats fine.  But it'll still be more fun to tame wilds, and I hope they don't take that away either. <p>---------------------------------<br>

I'm afraid the devs do too much of hurting other professions to try to fix problems with others, like nerfing accuracy while running because they can't make melee players happy (I know there are other reasons for that nerf, but that's not really what this thread is about).<br>
<br>
I also agree that taming wild pets is way more fun than buying a BE pet, but if the devs were to start giving BEs improvements (and not just take something from the CHs and hand it to BEs, like I bet they do with medium armor) then I would actually consider getting a BE pet.  One advantage would be if they grew faster than wild tamed pets, and if they could have more, and customizable, special abilities.<br>
<br>
One thing that I'm really afraid they'll take away from CH's before they even get it is wild tamed mounts.  I'm dreading a friday feature that announces &quot;Only BE made pets will be mountable.&quot;  I know that because it's my greatest fear, somehow Holo will know and revel in implementing it.

<br>
1) have CH's be able to bring wild animals to BE's for enhancement. A sort of flesh n blood equivalent to slicing.<br>
<br>
2) have BE's be able to make DNA sampling devices that can be used by CH's CH's still get to have the fun of going out into the wild in search of pets and BE's are not removed from the loop (plus they could free up those skill points spend in exploration if the wanted to)<br>
<br>
3) have CH's be able to capture animals to bring into the BE's for either genetic enhancement or risk free sampling for the BE. We could get shackles and chains &amp; stuff. how could woud that look to have a CH walking into town with a chained up rancor clinking along behind them.<br>
<br>
Now nearly all CH's will bring nearly all their pets into BE for either enhancements or to provide DNA material for further pets.<br>
<br>
BE's have an easier way to go and business will increase<br>
<br>
There will be no animosity or tension between the 2 classes.<br>
<br>
BE/CH interdependance will increase<br>
<br>
Also, there will still be a need to go into the wild to get pets. Pretty soon true master CH's will be overpowered by people half way up the tree who, instead of spending hours risking life and limb in the wild, spend an afternoon grinding destroy missions and bought their pet from a scientist. <br>
This will be the case because an augmented BE creation has the same CL as it's weaker, wild counterpart. <br>
<br>
A master BE friend of mine made a rancor with 14k ham that hit for about 650. That's about on par with something inbetween a mutant rancor - enraged rancor (both level 70 and up) If that's the case, we're going to have level 34 mountain squills that will be a match for level 50 gurrecks and rancors. That just doesn't sound right. <br>
<br>
I like BE's I just want them to play a roll that makes both their class and CH's more fun and usefull, not overshadow some of the most fun aspects of my class. (3/4 of the reason I chose CH was because I read verts guide on taming and it just sounded like so much fun) <br>

But only a percentage of the BEs will go for that.<br>
<br>
Yes, its crafting.  But sneaking up into a herd of CL70 aggros and going for the dna sample is just as much fun as taming.  :) :) .. if thats your sort of thing.<br>
<br>
I'd rather see BEs get more service from Rangers.  We need thier creature id skills, and thier meat harvesting skills.<br>
<br>
Sadly, BE taking scout + medic reqs means you really need artisan and weapon to function (have to harvest meat & flora).  So BE's to make good things need 4  of the 6 basic classes, and that leaves no rom for us to go up the Ranger tree except as dabblers.<br>
<br>
Rather than pet slicing (you should consider BE models as the sliced ones) .. have pet power ups.  Just like weapon ones.  Existing BE components look like syringes.  Ideally the resource requirements wouldn't be as rare as most of the BE tree, and they'd fix BE factory use so you could buy a crate of syringes to powerup your wild pet's HAM, or Att Spd.<br>
<br>
Like other powerups, they should NOT work on sliced (i.e BE models).  So if you buy canned it should be better but you can't power it up.  That would allow BE standalone pets or wild with BE powerups to be equivalent power.  It gives the BE a renewable income.  It lets the CH that wants to tame do so and NOT sacrifice power.  Yet, someone can blow through a few destroy missions and grab a sliced pre-made pet too.  If you're the sort looking for convenience. <p>---------------------------------<br>
