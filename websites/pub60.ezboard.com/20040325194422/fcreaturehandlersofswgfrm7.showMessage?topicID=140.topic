First off, i dont PVP that often, but if i happen to be in Anchorhead and a bunch of imps are raiding the city, i will sometimes join in the defence (i am covert).<br>
<br>
Im not a MCH yet (I am at 3-4-2-4), so i am currently using pets like graul maulers, Ravenous Tortons, a 2 Boar Wolf Combo, etc...<br>
<br>
My problem is this ..<br>
<br>
Every time i send one of my pets after imps, it is bled, set on fire and incapacitated within 10 seconds of the word "Attack".<br>
<br>
The main reason for this is Fire. Is there any defence against this? Are there any pets that dont catch on fire and fall in 10 seconds? Is it special "Heat" protection that will prevent fire damage? And furthermore, is there any defence for ME against this? I wear a bit of composite/padded armor (not a lot of it -- 4 pieces), but it makes no difference.<br>
<br>
Is there a "Stop, drop and Roll" command? Cause i have not found a way to put the fire out, other than waiting about 3-4 minutes until my health is so wounded tht it takes 15 min in a med centre to recover.<br>
<br>
First aid doesnt seem to do anything ... can Doctors put out fire?<br>
<br>
If anyone has any pet suggestions (better pets to use) or an idea of how to put out fire/prevent it from hitting me, please help :)<br>
<br>
Just trying to last more than 10 seconds in PVP ... <br>

At most what your pet does is distract your enemy giving you precious seconds to blast them away. Most players will panic when they see some beast attacking them and will instinctively attack back giving you a chance to blast them away. That is one reason why GSP/GW/Gurneck/Grauls are popular PVP pets coz they are easy to get, plentiful, disposable and has good resist against fire and can stand up somewhat to flamethrower wielding commandos. Don't expect your pet to last too long tho. Just sic your pet in and start blasting and hope the commando player panics and targets your pet and not you while you blast him/her.<br>
<br>
Here's another tip, if your pet is burning, quickly store it, the burn should be magically cured (dunno if they changed this or not). Same can be used on poisoned and diseased pets. I suppose your datapad has a Bacta tank for pets :P<br>

Anything to do, or am I pretty much done for? Most other DOTs have some type of cure ... First aid for bleeding, Doctor cures for poison or disease ... anything for Fire?<br>
<br>
Thx for tips on pets ... I was kinda hoping there was a pet out there that just laughed at fire damage and ran right through it ;)<br>
<br>
The main difficulty i had was, i was being sniped and set on fire ... i had thought that Flamethrower had a really short range, but the people hitting me were 64 meters + on top of a hill shooting down (The hills behind the shuttleport in Anchorhead). So i would send my pet and he wouldnt even get up the hill before being mowed down. I am talking literally 5-8 seconds of life before being incapacitated.<br>
<br>
And i was out of pistol range when being set on fire .. or just barely in pistol range ... cant remember which, but i DO remember that i never even got close enough to fire off more than 2 shots.<br>
<br>
Are there any other weapons besides Flamethrower that have the ability to set someone on fire? Or is it just the Flamethrower has a much better range than i thought?<br>
<br>

So it's still quite a bit of range than most people thought. Doctors can stop burnings I believe. The thing is commandos are way overpowered with their flamethrowers. Those things needs to be toned down (reduce their burning damage or duration or their range cut down to around 8m). Unfortunately there are no weapons out there that can shoot farther than 64m. The only reliable way to take out commandos is to have riflemen mind shot them from 64m away... all it takes is just one mindshot 2 to knock them out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alladdim>alladdim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#70DB93>(11/20/03 1:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=140.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pets in PVP?</span><hr size=1> Here's a few useful tips (according to Sun Tzu - Art of War book):<br>
<br>
1. Maintain terrain advantage. According to your situation, your opponents are situated at an elevated location. This gives them an elevated position advantage (meaning they can look down and see you easily while you can't look up and see them easily). The terrains in SWG are designed to emulate real life physics, meaning you will run up a slope slower than you run down. Unless you have really good scouting/ranger skills you will definitely walk up an elevated terrain slower giving your opponent the chance to kill you before you get to them. <br>
<br>
2. Since they are the invaders. Use your home court advantage. Do not go to your enemies, let them come to you. For short, fight in your own terms. Use your housing and other structures as cover. Create a situation where the enemy has to come to you and fight in your terms. If they are invading your city that means they are looking for a fight, they WILL come to you. If you mindlessly charge your enemy it'll be just like painting a huge target crosshair on top of your head. Again, use cover, your enemy can't shoot thru walls.<br>
<br>
3. If the invaders overwhelm your forces 2 to 1 then use guerilla tactics. Urban warfare is the most dangerous and bloody kind of warfare. It is used when a force is at a disadvantage in terms of man power and fire power. It is used to whittle down invading forces. Again use your housing/structures as cover, use your snipers (riflemen) to pick off your enemies one by one.  If they really want to get you, make them work for it and create a situation where they will suffer losses. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zumbukfleshcarver>Zumbuk Fleshcarver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#70DB93>(11/20/03 2:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=140.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pets in PVP?</span><hr size=1> Alot of that advice would be great if terrain meant something in this game. But when you can shoot a laser through 40 feet of solid rock and hit your opponent, using terrain and things like that kinda falls through.<br>
<br>
One thing you can do if you are burning is run for water. Of course you cant do this on Tatooine unelss youre near an oasis. But other planets that have plentiful water sources can provide relief from a burn.<br>
<br>
Theres not alot you can do for a pet other than store it if it is on fire. Their resistance to heat may help prevent initial damage, but the fire DoT bypasses that each time it tics. I would suggest that if you ever get Master CH, to use something like a Rancor or Gurreck for PvP due to its higher HAM and damage, it might just make a difference in how long the pet stays alive. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.netset.com/~blazer/sig3.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Still wish there was a "stop, drop and roll" command tho :)<br>
<br>
In the future, i guess it IS just a matter of patience and guile when dealing with a commando team who start sniping from the vantage point of the hill above the Anchorhead shuttleport...<br>
<br>
Ill remember about the storing of pets, and the "run towards water" thing. On tatooine, you are right .. not really an option, but hey :)<br>
<br>
As i mentioned, I dont really do that much PVP, but when i do, i want to be as competent as possible and not just be a pushover.<br>
