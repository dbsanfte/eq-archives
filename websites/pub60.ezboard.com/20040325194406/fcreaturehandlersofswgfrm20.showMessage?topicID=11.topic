The reduction from 70 to 60 of the max total CL essentially makes CH a single pet profession. While MCH can ride a 10 mount with a 50 pet at his/her side, all of our best pet duos are rendered obsolete. Yet now’s not the time for our tears: it is going to get worse. There remains the outstanding issue of under-30 pets being stripped of light armor and over-30 pets having their CL “adjusted” (raised). Additionally, the new agro system, coupled with the increase in social mobs, makes rifle an untenable weapon choice due to the defensive penalties.<br>
<br>
My greatest pleasure in this fatally flawed game has been the seeking out and taming of creatures ideally suited to compliment each other in battle. The changes will render most of my pets worthless, as the 34/34, 45/25, 40/30 and 50/18 combos I used are no longer possible.<br>
<br>
This latest rounds of changes simply provides additional evidence of the sorry state of the game in general. It was released unfinished. It has numerous bugs that should have been fixed in beta3. While the crafting system clearly received far more attention than combat, it too is bollocks. Chefs’ food buffs are bugged, SL buffs are broken, armor is problematic at best, droids are in a sorry state and decay is harsh, to name but a few of the deficiencies. The combat system was not fully conceived and has been in a state of flux since release.<br>
<br>
All along the optimistic among us have clung to the game’s potential. This latest round of nerfs is the last straw for this MCH. Without the special pet duos I worked so hard to gather in my datapad, I am no longer interested in swg. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Screw SOE and their shitty games. I hope the game falls through and Raph Koster and friends end up poor and destitute, having to give oral sex to people in back alleys just to afford a pack of smokes. May any future games by SOE dry up on the vine and die early. Stupid morons wouldnt know good development if it came up and bit them. All they do is nerf and tear down.<br>
<br>
Lowering the CL to 60?? What the hell are they thinking? So wheres the reward for making Master CH? There is none. This also kills the hope that they would finally un-bug Kimoguilas and make them tamable. Screw em. Right now I wouldnt even piss on a SOE dev if he was on fire. They all blow dog.

<br>
All skill trees rearranged, breaking current titles.<br>
<br>
Master CH only able to call TWO pets total... and you have to be a master to call the second.<br>
<br>
Non-CH CL limited to 10, instead of the current 15.<br>
<br>
Further talk of sub-CL 30 creature nerfing.<br>
<br>
Only ONE pet out at a time for non-CH. That means no droid plus faction pet, plus creature... just ONE of them.<br>
<br>
All of this for the low, low, bargain basement price of a smile and 4 more stored creatures. Who wants a bigger zoo when you can't play with the animals in it anyway???<br>
<br>
<br>
I've kept my mouth shut with the last several swings of the nerfbat, but for some reason SOE seems to think that it's logical to break one of the few decently PvE playable classes left in the game. And just to make things more even??? Anyone else remember when the CL cap was brought from 100 down to 70? It's barely workable now, because there's NO PC that can tank a MOB as effectively as pets. That's not the fault of the CH's though, it's having MOBs that hit between 500 and 1000 per swing, and only 1000 HAM to begin with on PC's!!! If they don't want Krayts and the like tanked with AT-STs and pets, then either don't make higher level mobs so tough, or make PC's tough enough to actually put a dent in them. And don't even get me started on the utterly useless Kimogilas. Sure, this will make the game more of a challenge. But it will also kill any decent hopes of fun solo PvE gameplay, which is what the last survey showed most people were interested in.<br>

I've already gotten rid of my 3 GSPs, but even two creature combos will be worthless.  They're getting rid of all armor on creatures below CL 30, and increasing the CL of good creatures above CL 30.  This means that there won't be anything worth pairing with anything above CL 30.  There may be a couple CL 30/CL 30 combos, and CRC may go with something like BDQ.  However, this is effectively the end of trying to find creatures that complimented each other, which was one of the most fun parts of being a CH.  The devs INTEND for us to fight with only one creature at a time, and the ability to call a second at master is meaningless, other than being able to use a mount, which is useless in combat for a CH anyway. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~imho.teppa/Pax_Imperius_Custom_Campaign.html"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~bdr33/imhosig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

They did say they were going to introduce more pets so they'd better make the ones we still have beter as well. rancors should have AR2, as should gurrekcs and every mother f##king animal in the game level 50 and below should friggin spawn babies damn it.

They will never tell anyone the complete truth about what they intend to do. They will keep their &quot;vision&quot; for the game shrouded in mystery, so youll forever question just what it is that they want from the playerbase. <br>
<br>
Believe me, I played EQ for 4 years out of Beta 4 and SOEs reputation for not correctly informing its playerbase is only matched by their inability to admit when they goofed up and correct it.<br>
<br>
This game is doomed now. <br>
<br>
Something I find odd is all the people cheering for this. Especially the Master CHs out there. They claim that it helps get rid of the &quot;dabblers&quot;...a word Ive grown to hate as much as &quot;Star Warsy&quot; and &quot;Rancorchu&quot;... I happen to be a Master CH with Light Lightning Cannon 4 and Bounty Pistol 3. Does that make me a dabbler because I have part of another profession? If so, then were ALL dabblers. I dont know any Master CH out there that doesnt have skill points in other professions. <br>
<br>
And for this Thunderheart person to say that people &quot;exploited&quot; the skill tree. LOL What a pile of dung. This guy has to be either Abashi or that other dorktard they hired to be the public rep for EQ, because their lack of the game always shines through and the only time they open their mouth is to change feet. So making combo professions is now an exploit according to Thunderheart and SOE. heh heh Figures. They put in this system and players use it to be most beneficial to them and SOE calls it an exploit and &quot;fixes&quot; it.<br>
<br>
Ive seen alot of MCH on the SOE boards saying this will make MCH worth something again... wha?? How does taking away a bunch of stuff that made getting MCH almost worth it suddenly make it worth it? It doesnt make sence. Its like having 100 people, all with wooden legs, and someone comes up and takes all the legs away from everyone but 10 people they only take 1 leg from them. So now you have 90 legless people and 10 people with 1 wooden leg. Does that suddenly mean that having a wooden leg means so much more? Youre still crippled. You still cant walk around. All it means is those 10 people with 1 wooden leg can lay on the floor with the legless people and show off their 1 wooden leg. Everyone is still in the same boat.<br>
<br>
It makes no sense. SWG has to be the only game Ive ever played where the people that played a gimped unfinished profession would try to drag every other profession down with them, rather than try to get themselves pull up out of the crap they were in. Sure, people did this in EQ, but nothing to the extent of SWG. Ive never seen so many overly critical, whiney people in all my life. It almost makes me ashamed to be a Star Wars fan.<br>
<br>
One last thing... if they had given any thought to it, dont you think the question of &quot;If the rest of the game is so much fun and worth playing, why did so many people flock to get CH skills and have pets?&quot; Think about that one. If the rest of the game is still so exciting and worth it without pets... why were they so popular as to deserve a nerf as big as this? Now were all stuck in the boring nonsensical game that the complainers play in. Well..some people are stuck there. Im done with this game. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.netset.com/~blazer/sig3.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
