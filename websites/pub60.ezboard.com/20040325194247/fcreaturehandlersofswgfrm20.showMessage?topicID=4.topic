<br>
<br>
Ive spent the last two days on both Dantooine and Endor looking for decent CL 30-34 pets. Ive come up empty handed. The amount of tamable pets between 30 and 34 is pathetic. Not to mention the fact that it seems baby spawns have been reduced greatly. <br>
<br>
Bile Drenched Quenkers found on Dantooine... or are they? In running a complete circle around the planet yesterday, I managed to see a group of 5 Bile Drenched Quenkers. No lair, just roamer spawns with no babies. And they were all clumped together, so there was no way to pull any single. The AI on many aggressive mobs has been changed as well. A great many of them will no longer &quot;stalk&quot; you or follow you after you pass near them. So pulling singles is a bit more difficult. I spent a good hour tapping a regular Quenker lair in the hopes that some Bile Drenched ones would pop. No such luck. I managed to see every kind of Quenker there is, but only 5 Bile Drenched clumped under a tree.<br>
<br>
On to Endor...beautiful planet. Reminds me of the Rocky Mts. Too bad its as barren as Hoth. I managed to run all the way from the Smuggler outpost, up north to the edge of the map, then west to the edge there, then south til I was even with the Smuggler camp and then east back to camp...not one single blip on my radar. Nothing. Zip. Nada.<br>
<br>
I decided to go south. I ran to the science outpost. Only when I got within 700m of the outpost did I start to see creatures on radar, and even then it was those little goblin things. So I managed to look up some Merek missions. Id love to get my hands on a Merek Assassin. Ive asked every CH on the planet if they knew of a good area to find them. The only helpful response I got was that they were &quot;rare&quot;. So I manage to find two missions for them and head on out. I get to one and its guarded by two Merek Harvesters, a Merek Deathshead, and a Toxic Merek Battlelord. So I move on to the next one. No way could I kill those with just my Crimson Razor Cat and myself. <br>
<br>
I reach the other lair and lo and behold...Merek Assassins, and one Merek King Harvester. I begin to move in and out of range of the assassins and slowly draw them away from eachother. I begin killing them and finally God smiles on me and a baby spawns. Im overjoyed. I put on my armor, unequip my weapon, and begin to crawl in. My maskscent is broken by a nearby creature...WTF?? Maskscent sucks soooo bad now. I get aggro but then it goes away...its one of those Mantigrue things...so happened theres a lair of them not 50m away from the Merek lair. Suddenly I see the babys HAM falling. BAH!! The damn Mantigrue has gotten aggro from some Mereks, including the baby..and for some evil twisted reason its killing the damn baby first. Baby dies in a couple minutes. I curse SOE and their retarded creature system.<br>
<br>
So I crawl back out, re-don my normal clothing, make a camp, call out my cat again and once again begin the task of trying to kill off the Mereks that have now respawned. Killing... killing... killing... ok I get an add. Its the King. Lucky me he aggroed me instead of my pet and now Im poisoned. I get incapped and my pet finishes off the first Merek Assassin. The king incaps him a couple minutes later as I lay there watching. Without missing a beat..King comes over. DB. Im back at the science outpost. Bleh... screw Endor. Screw Dantooine too. <br>
<br>
Im sick of running across an entire planet for days to end up with nothing to show for it. I could have joined the Empire in that time, and built up enough points to buy 2 ATSTs and be uber like every other Imp with the damn things. Noooo..I like the challenge of taming babies and raising them. I want to be a Master Creature Handler. Gah! Curse SOE and their stupid ideas. Curse the entrie SOE message boards for being full of nerf crying morons.<br>
<br>
Give CH a max CL of 100. Make EVERYTHING have babies. Let us have Medium armor pets. Give us a friggin break! Im just tired of seeing our profession getting hammered because people are too dumb to understand it. People have no clue what is involved in being a CH...a TRUE CH. Not one that goes and buys a Rancor from a BE, but one that goes and tames that bad boy himself. Theres a rush that comes with being under 6 or 7 Grauls trying to tame a baby that wont stand still and you keep failing on. But people dont see that. They think we just run up and hit a button and poof the baby is our and we skip and frolic back to town with our new uber pet.<br>
<br>
They dont understand how people select pets. the resists and how they work. The lack of armor on most pets. The whole vitality loss thing. The limited and deballed lists of creatures that we can tame. They never see it, or just flat out refuse to see it. I wish I could have taken every nerf crying dorktard from the SOE boards on my trips with me the last couple days so they could see just how much of a pain in the butt it can be. Its not all &quot;attack&quot; and go AFK. Will they ever understand? Will it ever make a difference to SOE if they did?<br>
<br>
Sorry for the ramble but Im tired, my server is stuck Loading, and Im pissed off about having 3 open pet slots for a week now, and not being able to fill them. Im mad because I thought I understood this convoluted system of taming and training that they yanks out of their rear and enforced upon us. But I dont. I thought I knew how it worked...I thought I read that it worked a certian way but I have no idea how it works now. It was my understanding that with the taming skill of 35 I could tame a creature up to and including CL 35. With taming vicious creatures at 10, I could tame a creature that had a ferocity level of up to and including 10. But nooooo. For some reason, a Graul Mauler that is CL 34 and Ferocity 10 is untamable by me. I need to get Tame and Train 3 to get them. Great...no biggie though. I'll get that eventually. I just hate having to try to work out the riddle of the sphinx that is our profession now.<br>
<br>
Put more creatures in the game. More upper level ones that we can tame. Make BEs useful. I feel bad for those guys too. All the things they can make and half of them are untamable. Gimme my damn Kimoguilla you schmucks!!<br>
<br>
Ok...Im done. For now. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.netset.com/~blazer/sig3.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I too was on Endor looking for a merek or arachne at that time, running everywhere with no luck.  I ran from the Smuggler's Outpost to the West border, up the the NW corner, across the desert to the NE corner, south, then back down to the smuggler post and saw maybe 4 things.  Frequently I would just auto-run with num lock for 1/2 hour to an hour without seeing anything.  I was going nuts with, what I thought was, my bad luck; so I /telled my friend to gather our group and head on over to Endor so we could all go out and kill whatever we found (we hunt Endor about every other day so we knew what to expect).  Again, even with our whole group packed together we found practically nothing.  After most of the people had given up and left the planet we managed to find a couple creatures around the outpost and killed them.<br>
<br>
But I think it was only the next day that everything was back.  The hills north and west of the smuggler's post was again teaming with lairs and packs surrounding them.  But in my now 4 days of looking I've seen 1 baby merek (blood-stained) but failed to catch it when the 4 other mereks around it aggrod and killed me.  I found 1 mantrigue (night stalker I believe) but before I could get close enough to try taming it an aggravated bordok mare aggrod the mantrigues and it went into combat mode.  Luckily though, the mare didn't kill the baby......no, it instead came after me and killed me; damn bitch cow.  But on the good side I did find and catch a 9k HAM 260-270 dmg Hanadak Drifter.<br>
<br>
If you want a merek, I suggest the entire area north of the research outpost.  I was wandering around there and came upon about 20 lairs, none with babies though.  Even after drawing some of them away, shooting the liars, and getting new ones to spawn I wasn't even rewarded with a CHANCE to catch one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> 07530</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#70DB93>(10/21/03 9:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> reply</span><hr size=1> Well you had good potensial running accross the planet, but all the creatures will be by the city.
