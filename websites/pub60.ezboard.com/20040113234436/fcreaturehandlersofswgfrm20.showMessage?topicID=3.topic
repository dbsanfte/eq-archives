Since I can't, nor do I longer wish to, post on the SWG posts I'll do it here and hope some of you agree and are willing to speak about it on the official board (even though you will undoubtedly get flamed, harassed, and called not-nice names).<br>
<br>
I'm in Theed and a rebel commando is there with 2 of his buddies.  As I walked through the streets I saw a couple imp bodies on the ground so I figured I'd give it a try and fight the guys.  I go overt, get out my 3 NPC soldiers and my 5.5k HAM mountain dewback.  I send them all to attack the same guy as I open fire on him.  Suddenly I am being blasted with a flamethrower and scatter pistol.  The pistol wasn't doing much, but even using stims the FTer put me down in 1 hit.  If being 1-shotted isn't bad enough, I checked my combat log and the same guy (who somehow managed to stay alive even with 3 troopers and a dewback attacking him) hit my mountain dewback for around 5600-5700 dmg, MORE DAMAGE THAN MY PET HAS HEALTH.  He quickly killed the troopers aswell, they stood no chace.<br>
<br>
Later on (actually just a couple minutes ago) I was in Moenia.  My buddy and I were wreaking havok with my 2 female plain tusk cats and his 3 GSPs.  We successfully killed all the overt and TEFed people we could find and were doing rather well, healing all of our damage and stopping our bleeding before fighting again.  But we get the daily restart message telling us the server is going down so we start to head out to a safer place we can log out at.  As we're leaving, a reb runs up behind us and kills my buddy with his scatter pistol (my friend was lagging so bad he didn't even know he was being attacked until he was dead and his 3 GSPs did nothing to help him).  I get a Tab on the guy and send my 2 FPTCs.  We're shooting it out and he's being mauled, he has about 30 action pool left before he uses a stim and switches to his handy LLC.  Next thing I know, I see an incap message (I figure it was the msg telling me that I got him, but no, I fall to the ground).  He manages to DB me right before my cats incap him, unfortunately, this ONE time they decide not to DB (even though they usually do, which pisses me off because then I get no faction points).  I go back, check the log, and come to see that he's done 1802 dmg in PvP.  Pretty remarkable since I only have about 800 health....<br>
<br>
So, as it is plainly seen (by anyone who doesn't use a heavy weapon), even the mighty CH, in this case 2 mighty CHs, can't handle 1 frickin moron with a heavy weapon.<br>

I totally agree about the ATST farce, grief can you see anywhere in the films (which IS I think what SWG is based on? Sorta?) anywhere in the films where even the highest ranking Imp has a pair of PERSONAL ATST's? Nah, not a chance. Imagine in the real world (it does exist, I been there!...Honest!) where even a General, Field Marshall whatever is trailed by a couple of Tanks as his bodyguard?

There were probably 6 of them, 2 had pets and 3 had FTers (FlameThrowers).  So some imps started going overt to fight back, including atleast 1 commando.  From then on the fighting was literally run up to someone, kill them in 1 shot, get killed yourself, clone, come back with a TEF, and 1-shot that person.  That was all they did.<br>
<br>
The yesterday another commando came the Theed, I happened to be sitting around the starport selling a house with my Hanadak Drifter (80% heat resists) when she pops in from the star port.  I stand up and start moving away, as soon as she shoots another imp, I sent my drifter in to tank while I keep distance to stay out of range (this is actually a tip another reb commando gave me).  Im about 30m away from her when she switches from FTer to rocket launcher.  I thought they were supposed to be within like 15m and shoot real slow; at least that's what they say.  She shot about 4 round in 10 seconds and killed me.  Then she continued to run off with my Drifter still attacking her with his 260-270 dmg.  I don't know what happened because I was cloning, but when I found where they had run off to, he was dead and on fire.  So their weaknesses may sund good in theory, but they don't work in practice.  And that @#%$ burning does so much dmg I'm fairly sure he died from that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varyagwh>Varyag WH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/1/03 3:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I can't tolerate these new heavy weapons</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">WOW!</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> After that, I <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>REALLY</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> wanna go Commando!<br>

Soon all you'll be seeing are commandos. No more pistolers, no more carbineers and even less riflemen. Heck, meleers right are like 1 in 100 players. And these days all i see are commandos trying to hide their profession under the Novice Medic title (yet you see them packing their flamethrowers). It's good that Sony is trying to make commandos great but doing so they are killing off the fun in PVP due to monty haul one-shot killings. Aside from the damage they really should severely reduce the wounds and duration of the burning effect. I mean i dueled with a PA fellow and the guy (a commando) accidentally shoot me with his flamethrower and the burn last for like 10 damn minutes all the while giving me 200-300 wounds each minute and that's only with one shot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cobragt18>cobragt18</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://img1.ranchoweb.com/images/cobragt18/pirate-swordclear.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/2/03 7:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://img2.ranchoweb.com/images/cobragt18/pirate-knifeteeth-new.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I can't tolerate these new heavy weapons</span><hr size=1> The wounds are a whole nother issue.

Though I have pleased quite a few medics by bringing in my burned up pets and letting them heal their 3000+ wounds.<br>
<br>
And as long as we're talking about crazy dmg and duration I have to bring up poison.  I had a TEF in kaadara when I sat my char down to watch a show, I came back to the computer when I heard the combat music.  I get back right as my char gets incapped and the guy who did it is trying to get around a wall to come DB me.  I tell him it was low so he chooses not to kill me since I was after all AFK.  Over the next 30-60 minutes I was incapped nine different times by his poison, each time I had to wait out the incap timer, heal back to full, and it would kick in again.  Same sort of thing had happened before but that time I was so furious I just logged off till the damn poison subsided. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zzelkin>Zzelkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/2/03 10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I can't tolerate these new heavy weapons</span><hr size=1> Ya, combat medics have some serious posions they can use.<br>

Kinetic protection is only good for hunting animal mobs now, imho. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cobragt18>cobragt18</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://img1.ranchoweb.com/images/cobragt18/pirate-swordclear.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/2/03 11:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://img2.ranchoweb.com/images/cobragt18/pirate-knifeteeth-new.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I can't tolerate these new heavy weapons</span><hr size=1> A reb medic was talking trash in the theed cantina while he was overt.  He said to some other guy who I'm guessing had challanged him to a duel &quot;I can incap you in 1 second with my poison.&quot;  Now how are we supposed to fight that?  For goodness sake you have to be a doctor to stop poison, it does huge dmg, and it lasts forever...<br>

As for everyone else in PvP you'd need like a Toxic Merek Battlelord to help much.  Most combat classes have atleast 3 types of dmg they can use, so even if you have a pet that has real high resits to two of their dmgs, they'll still find a way to kill it real quick.  Or as the commando said right before the 4 of us killed the gorax &quot;he may have high resists, but his ass will still burn.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.emailToFriend?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub60.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm10">SWG Discussion<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm7">Creature Handler Tips<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm8">Creature Challenge Levels<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm20">RANTS!<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm14">Creature Handler Stories<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm16">Our Bio-Engineer Friends!<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm18">Anything goes!<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm3">Polls<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm9">Nerf Herders<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm17">Link it!<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm13">Ch Hideout<option value="creaturehandlersofswgfrm19">Suggestions to impove this forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#70DB93>- </font><a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/bcreaturehandlersofswg>Creature Handlers of SWG</a><font color=#70DB93> - </font><a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/fcreaturehandlersofswgfrm20>RANTS!</a> <font color=#70DB93> - </font><a href="Creature Handlers of SWG">Creature Handlers of SWG</a><font color=#70DB93> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
