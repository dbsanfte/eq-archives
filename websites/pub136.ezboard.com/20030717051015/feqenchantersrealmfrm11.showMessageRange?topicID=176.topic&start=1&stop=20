Not on the dire charm aspect, but it has always been true that if the charmed mob does all the damage then it gets more xp.<br>
<br>
The big change is in the Command of Druzzil class of charms.  This change is being mirrored in the Necro and Druid Charms of similar level.  In the past, these charms had a huge resist adjust (-50).  This was removed in mid-March on the Test Server to a 0 (see Lucy for details).<br>
<br>
So, why are they doing this?  Add in Howl of Tashan and Command of Druzzil with Total Domination and people were getting pretty close to 8 minutes of charming all the time.  Thus as has been yelled about in many forums, enchanters with a lot of skill, luck and intestinal fortitude could solo Tier 3 mini-bosses with charmed pets.<br>
<br>
So, yes Command of Druzzil is returning to the same resist adjust as Beckon.<br>

Mind you, I have tried more than several times to figure charm out, in several different zones at different levels up to 47.  I have never had uber gear, clickies, or piles of cash for runes - but i have had a few runes and JBoots.  Unfortunately this was never enough to cut it as a Charm Soloer.  I still don't know what the 'secret' is.  Honestly.  My INT has been about 215 (with my int gear up) and CHA between 150 and 170 from lvl 42 to 51 (with lvl 34/44 cha buffs - I have to double fist int gear right now).  Last I tried was Charm killing stuff in Eastern Wastes at Level 44.  Charm broke enough times, and root resisted/broke enough times to force my HP down so far that I HAD to gate after only one kill.  I was doing the Mammoth charm/killing routine I have seen posted elsewhere.  I had more downtime and blew several runes and almost died.  Not a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
I honestly still don't see the point of Charm except for a few situations and quests (epic)  Not that I expect Chanters to be uber-soloers like Druids/Necros, but a little something would be nice.  Now that Beastlords have a Mana Buff, Enchanters seem to be getting nerfed more and more.  This change to Charm, right when I was about to give 'er another go, pisses me off.  No wonder Chanters are relatively rare.  I've had players and 'friends' give me sh1t for not leveling to 60 just so I can dish KEI to their sorry ass.  Talk about annoying.<br>
<br>
I hope someone from SoE is reading this because I think that the new changes for XP gains from Charmed mobs In General is a bit much.  Changing XP gathered from a Dire Charmed pet? yeah that sounds fine, but I dont have DC yet and probably will never play enough to get it.  DC seems like it could be abused if you are getting full XP in certain situations considering the mobs you could DC might be kind of powerful (although I thought the DC level cap was 44)  But normal Charm is too unpredictable already, so why make it further useless?    I like the changing of agro to 50% to pet 50% to Chanter, but last I heard that was getting dropped but the other two nerfs were staying.  Anyone have any news about what is going live in tomorrows patch??<br>
<br>
I'm still afraid that I am 'missing something' with this whole charm ability that enchanters have, but from what it sounds like its just gear or buff related and not so much tactics, because I've honestly spent over 6 hours play time trying to get a good charm killing routine down in OT, EW and several other zones to no avail.  This is with safe pulling techniques (no adds) decent buffs, decent stats (I think) decent gear (for my level) and a fast computer with high speed connection.<br>
<br>
Am I missing something?  Charmroxors - you say that Charm Roxors.  Is this just with your uber gear or lvl 60 buffs from friends before you go out on a charm killing expedition or is this with even level buffs and gear obtainable at your level?  I wanna know, I'm dying to know.<br>

Well, I was not a big Charm soloer until recently.  Basically, I use it to fill in time waiting for groups in PoV or PoS.<br>
<br>
The patch is out, but I have not yet gone through the xp changes yet so I will see.  As for the aggro thing, I slow and tash the mobs I am soloing.  I have plenty of aggro.<br>
<br>
The only resist change was to Command of Druzzil (our level 64 charm).  If you are not level 60 yet, it should not matter to you for a while.<br>
<br>
I am working on my charming primarily near the front of PON and am getting about 2 - 3 ticks of aa xp per kill.  Not bad.  I get usually 2 - 3 mobs dead before I have to worry about recharm (by the way Arcane Rune rocks for this).<br>
<br>
I am attaching my Magelo, so that you can view moderate equipment for this level (If you are in a high end guild, this stuff will be laughable).<br>

Sounds to me like the same sort of thing that happened to mages and their pets awhile back.  I don't see this as that big a deal, if you're soloing, losing even 1/3 xp to your pet is a small price to pay.  When I charm, I typically do it with a druid or ranger friend so they can snare and charm is much more managable.  I'm not sure how this will affect a group like that.  If I'm with a ranger, they are typically firing arrows until the mob flees, I call of pet and ranger finishes it off.<br>
<br>
I don't understand the other change:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>- Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's preferred target if there are many players available for the monster to attack instead.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Any time I've had a charmed mob attacking an NPC, the NPC seemed to always prefer to bang on any PC standing within attack range.  I even tried using root to place the charmed mob closer to the enemy to use root aggro and that didn't work either.  Not sure how that patch is going to affect me.  I get the impression that some people were using the pet as a tank and having other melees bang on the mob without getting aggro.  I'm not sure how that would be done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vtranzeashamanv>V Tranze Ashaman V</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#330000>(4/8/03 1:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.blizzard.com/war3x/images/screens/concept/ss07-thumb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Charms</span><hr size=1> In the last patch they didn't do anything to the resists of charm or to the experience loss of direcharm, but they did make it so 1/3 of exp was lost when a charmed mob does damage. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.calicatproductions.com/images/ego_pic.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=603041" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Tranze Asha'man</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;font-size:small;">Level 57 Enchanter</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto:Tranze_Ashaman@yahoo.com"> Tranze_Ashaman@yahoo.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=charmroxors>Charmroxors</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#330000>(4/8/03 1:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Charms</span><hr size=1> umm.... <br>

<br>
Charm Changes<br>
<br>
Healing a charmed pet now generates an appropriate amount of hate for the healer. <br>
<br>
Charmed pets now take up to one third of the experience for each NPC killed. This amount scales down based on the percentage of damage to the target that the pet does. Dire charm pets still take the same experience they always have.<br>
 <br>
Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's preferred target if there are many players available for the monster to attack instead.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=windariah>Windariah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#330000>(4/8/03 4:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Charms</span><hr size=1> I can deal relatively well with the 1/3 experience loss.  I was having nightmares of much worse then that for sure.  If they had gone with an 85% loss I think I would have retired the enchanter.  <br>
<br>
My biggest worry, and still is, is the aggro factor.  When I am charm soloing (or duoing with a cleric) I dont think this will even be a factor as I ALWAYS keep the mob rooted.  As long as I am not fighting mobs that do not summon then all should be well.  However, In a group situation, with a warrior tank (who is already having serious aggro issues in PoP) add slow, tash and pet and booya!  you have one dead enchanter.  So, in theory, I wont stop soloing or duoing, however, I will seriously consider adding that pet during a grouping experience. <p>Windarie Letsreydie<br>

Try Two Spells:<br>

Horrifying Visage - On MA Tanks in PoP, I hit them with HV on incoming.  It really helps them keep aggro and regain it quickly if they lose it.<br>
<br>
Boggle - Its expensive but its fast and it works.<br>

I can not heal my pet (with any of my spells that is) but my druid friend did 3 CH casts on his pet with no difference in aggro from the mob. <br>
Bang for the buck, you will be in dangerous areas with hard hitting mobs where the risk is not only high but often severely dangerous. The areas we speak of are Bot lower and tower bosses, PoTactics (named and pit/arena area), Hall of Honour, CoDecay. You can easily make 5-7 PCT a kill. If we lose 1 PCT to the pet, it will be fine. On a typical cycle of CoD you will be able to easily kill 3 mobs. That is 15 PCT of an AA in 8 minutes. This ratio can easily be 1 AA an hour. The truly adventorous types will get more. <br>
There is no magic really for solo charming normal mobs. You mezz, tash, charm, haste, guard pet. With sleep you have 54 seconds to get your new mob debuffed before you cast CoD. Once you have your pet, you can move towards a mob. Again, sick pet onto mob, tash, slow, root and stand back in safety. Be aware of enrage on these mobs (and they will enrage at 10%) so you will have to back your pet off for a few seconds during enrage (if solo) because this is where the pet will lose most of their HPs. After about the 3rd mob, your pet will be very lw on HPs. If you are soloing, just zone out. No healing, no aggro and it allows you time to med up from that flurry of action.<br>
If you duo charm (with NON chanters) there is more safety for you but the technique is fairly similiar.<br>

<br>
Charmroxors, I'm sorry if I offended you, I didn't mean to directly poke fun at or accuse you particularly of anything, and I realize it may have sounded that way - mostly I was just frusterated and you seemed to know what you were talking about. You're 60 and I'm only 51, it goes without saying you have more experience than I do.  <br>
<br>
I never actually said I <i>"think its just gear and/or buffs that do the charming, and that tactics arent actually involved."</i> I was just <b><i>wondering</b></i> if that was the case since most of the chanters I have seen rave about charming are either being PL'd with uber buffs or are seriously twinked or are double fisting chars and not tellin.  Again, this has just been my experience so far.  I was simply challenging you and all other chanters for proof otherwise.<br>
<br>
I would still like to see some more suggestions for charm killing at lower levels lets say 20-50.  Are there any published guides that deal specifically with Enchanter soloing tactics and techniques through these levels?  I realize we are primarily a grouping class, but any enchanter knows that grouping through all the levels is tedious to say the least.<br>
<br>
Also, what are some good tricks using a Charmed pet in a group prior to lvl 55?  What pets should you charm in what zones?  Anyone have some good experiences with this?  I have also tried that once or twice, <i>told my group what I was doing</i> and still ended up dying because my group was utterly clueless.  I guess they just couldnt read..  ;)<br>
<br>
Lets keep the charm tactics and tips coming!  It seems to be the 2nd great thing about chanters, I'd love to be able to get a serious guide to Charming going on from the posts on this board and a lot of you chanters have some great ideas and we all have unique experiences.<br>

<br>
the basics are simple. tash, charm, park. pull another mob with tash, root him on incoming. send the pet after the mob... slow the mob, haste your pet. after you've done it for a while you'll get a feel for certain pets that hold charm better, and what ones break charm often. its good to duo with someone who can snare.. having them pull with snare, then charming is quite an advantage since your pet wont be too fast of a runner. <br>
<br>
some basic tricks... are 1) always always always have a rune up, it will save your life more times than you'll notice. 2) always have a fast casting stun loaded, it'll make re-charming something tons easier. 3) try not to sit too often during charming, it might not be as bad where mobs only hit for 100 or so, but in the planes a double or triple for 300+, but when they break charm while you're sitting, it can get ugly if you try to stand and the hit you at the same time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
dont think that because some people are good about charming, or maybe brag about it, that it just happened overnight and bam they're doing an AA every 30 minutes. it takes a good while of practice and technique, and there's much strategy that goes into it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
there are some pretty decent guides, might want to check the &quot;old stuff&quot; forum, not sure if they've been moved over there or what. i'll probably get bored enough soon, so i'll see if i can write up a good guide here shortly. good luck with charming =) <p>Charmroxors<br>

Just before the kill, mez the MoB you're killing, cast invis on yourself (thereby breaking charm), mez your pet, then blur and nuke the original mob.  Woot! 100% XP all yours.  Re-charm your pet, and go get another one!<br>

Im on CoV faction, so it makes things easier.  There is an occasional LB mob but most are still DB.  Now I don't watch the XP bar like some but I been there a while and noticed that it seemed a little light so I started watching close.  I saw that I was killing anywhere from 6 - 10 mobs to get 1% while not doing any damage myself.  But when I threw on a Gasping Embrace and an occasional nuke I found that I was getting 1% either every kill or every other kill.  Looks to me as if it is taking more than 1/3 of the XP.  I have done the Nightstalkers in PoN with my druid since the patch as well and recall thinking that this may be the case, but since it was going into AA I did not notice as much.  It definitely was not what it once was...<br>
<br>
Anyone else getting this suspicion?<br>
<br>
Personally, I can understand the resists changes etc.  Sony doesn't want us chanters soloing Mini bosses, but the XP loss seems unnecessary.  I mean, why don't they have Necro pets taking 1/3 XP?  Not the charmed undead, the nearly unstoppable ones they always use... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=astyd>astyd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#330000>(5/19/03 12:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Charming and nerfage</span><hr size=1> <br>
I have had this discussion over at the Caster's Realm board.  There is a very vocal group of chanters who want a mass cancellation on June 1st.  I am not one of them.<br>
<br>
First, there are only 2 chanters that were effected by the MR nerf.  Beckon (was -10 adjust) and Command of Druzzil (was -50 adjust) are the only two spells affected.<br>
<br>
Second on the xp nerf, I have not seen it cause any issue if I do damage.  I generally throw in a cheap DoT to get my percentage of the kill.  Torment of Argli is very cheap and it does not ever break root, Torment of Scio is a bit more mana but does a lot more damage.<br>
<br>
Third, if you have been in a Planes group with a charmed mob you will notice the difference.  Even an unhasted mob will add to the DPS of the entire group in terms of damage.  That seems different than in the past.  As I recall, an all buffed Tier 2 mob does about 400 - 500 DPS.  AM3 Rangers and Rogues (not including Discs) do about 120 DPS.  Given that about 3 slots can be filled with them (1 Tank, 1 Slower, 1 Healer), you can see that this could be unbalancing.<br>
<br>
The major complaint is that Enchanters find it difficult to be the number 1 damage producer in Norrath.  I am actually quite okay with that, as I have never been a damage output machine.  I have been crowd control and buff/debuff.  Any DPS I add is gravy.  There is a complaint that Greater Fetter is a better crowd control spell.  In some cases that is true, but probably not for: small camps, caster mobs, and non-rootable mobs.<br>
<br>
Do I think that CoD got overnerfed?  Yes, I do.  I think the MR adjust should be somewhere between -10 and -30 (inclusive).  Do I believe that this nerf created a useless class?  No I do not.<br>
<br>
At the moment there are 3 classes that fall into the &quot;slower&quot; class that is basically a required class:<br>
<br>
Enchanter -<br>
Plusses: Mana Buffs, Hastes, Mezz, NDT, Aggro Buffing<br>
Minuses: Low DPS, No other buffs<br>
<br>
Shaman - <br>
Plusses: Melee Buffs, Backup Healer, Best Slow<br>
Minuses:  Root crowd control only, Low DPS<br>
<br>
Beastlord (65 only) -<br>
Plusses: Mana+HP Regen, High DPS<br>
Minuses: Buffs Pale against caster classes, Root crowd control only<br>
<br>
Given all of this, I do not have a big issue getting groups.  I don't have an issue charm soloing.<br>
