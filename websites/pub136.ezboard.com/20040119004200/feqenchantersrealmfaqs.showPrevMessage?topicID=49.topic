The Guide for the High Level Enchanter<br>
<br>
Introduction<br>
<br>
I decided to write this when I noticed two things:  Almost all the guides I have seen were written during before the release Luclin and therefore the changes from Luclin and beyond are not included.  However, the audience is different than one might expect.  This is written for experienced Enchanters who are in their 40's and 50's getting to that 55+ point.  So, there is no discussion here of the basics of enchanting.  Its all about the high level experience.  I am writing this with having experience in Tier 2 zones and below and after the Command of Druzzil Nerf.<br>
<br>
Changes with The Shadows of Luclin<br>
<br>
Luclin came around in the year 2001 and brought with it several new things.  Many of these are common to all classes including new zones and The Bazaar.  Some unique to Enchanters were our Alternate Advancement (AA) course and New Spells.  However the biggest single change related to the new class of mobs that were introduced.<br>
<br>
These new mobs populate zones like The Maiden's Eye and The Umbral Plains.  In response to the force that a group can bring to bear, these mobs hit hard and have a lot of hitpoints.  In order to make a reasonable xp group in these zones, all mobs that are going to be killed must be slowed.  In Kunark and Luclin, an Enchanter would slow mobs when he/she could as it was great damage mitigation.  However, this was always considered a secondary consideration to basic crowd control.  Sebillis and Velketor's Labyrinth tended to have a lot of adds, and therefore the need for crowd control.  Although Crowd Control remains important, without slowing each mob the chances of a group getting reasonable xp is nil.<br>
<br>
For the Enchanter, a new problem began to exist as well.  Many guides write about using the &quot;Color&quot; series of spells as a way to create time to mesmerize (mezz) a mob after a resist.  With Luclin, many more mobs became &quot;unstunnable&quot;.  Thus, the old tactic only made things worse.  The chanter still got the aggro, but did not get the benefit.  Thus, aggro management became significantly more important.  Paladins and Shadow Knights have excellent spell lines for the control of aggro.  For the old fashioned Warrior, the Horrifying Visage series (or the equivalent SK line) helps them maintain aggro.  Well, what could you do if getting whacked?  Root perhaps.  Mezz if it was an add.  If it was the pull wait for the tanks to pull it off of you.  <br>
<br>
There came Kodiac's Endless Intellect or KEI.  KEI has been a boon to all of Norrath and a bane to many Enchanters, although this has been lessening over time.  Instead of our short duration mental buffs, we finally had a single spell long lasting buff that covered Clarity, Brilliance and Gift of Insight.  This spell was so desirable that a market to cast it opened.  Enchanters were &quot;selling&quot; KEI for 100pp per cast.  Lots of platinum was being made and many people were not happy about paying this fee.  Most 60+ Enchanters now have KEI and it is broadly available albeit at a price around 15Kpp - 25Kpp (depends a lot on server).<br>
<br>
Luclin brought into the world the idea of AA.  The highest end guilds were in North Temple of Veeshan, Veeshan's Peak, and Sleeper's Tomb.  Most of their guild was at level 60 and had marvelous equipment.  So, what more could these characters do.  Beyond the new Luclin Equipment, AA provided a way of moving the character forward at level 60.  During Luclin, 3 types of AA were defined: General (available at level 51), Archetype (available at level 55), and Class (available at level 59).  Generally, the first 6 AA points are put in the Running Speed (RS) and Regen.  These latter are changeable to any other AAs, but RS3 is a basic chanter value.  When it comes to Archetype AAs, the choice is broader.  The following list provides what many feel is the priority of these:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spell Casting Subtlety (SCS) - Reduces Aggro from spells<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spell Casting Mastery (SCM) - Increases Chance of Specialization usage, thus saving mana<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Channeling Focus (CF) - Increasing the Channeling Skill by a percentage<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mental Clarity (MC) - Provides an extra tick of mana regen per level<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spell Casting Reinforcement (SCR) - Extends the amount of time that buffs last, thus saving mana<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Natural Durability (ND) - Adds Hitpoints<br>
<br>
The rest would be considered lower priority than these.  This order of this list would be highly controversial, and other than SCS subject to individual playing styles.  SCS is generally considered the most important by grouping Enchanters.  The requirement to slow (and perhaps Tash and Slow) has made the amount of aggro that Enchanters generate on a given pull to escalate.  Anything that reduces aggro saves our lives and is high priority.  From there its saving mana and ensuring spells get off.<br>
<br>
Our Class AAs are not perhaps as powerful as other classes.  There are some that are good on PvP servers (like Permanent Illusion) and some that are low priority (Jewelcrafting Mastery).  There are two that deserve special mention as they are the ones most likely to be utilized.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dire Charm (DC) - This ability gives the Enchanter the ability to Charm any mob that is level 46 or lower permanently.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mass Group Buff (MGB) - This ability gives the Enchanter the ability to Buff anyone within a radius with Group Buffs (like say KEI).<br>
<br>
Both of these are very expensive in terms of AA points and have long reuse timers.  Dire Charm creates the Enchanter for the first time as a damage dealer within the group environment on a regular basis.  Most charming has the problem of charm breaking, which it will at the worst time.  Mobs have more hitpoints and hit harder than the average Player Character, thus having one charmed is a boon to a group.  Mass Group Buff is a great raid tool that simplifies Raid Buffing tremendously.  Most high end guilds have MGB enchanters cast KEI at the start of a raid.<br>
<br>
Horses came out with Luclin as a slew of new models came out.  The lowest cost horse went for around 8.5K and is very helpful in outdoor zones for meditating.  This low end horse had two issues.  First, it is slow.  Slower than Jboots.  Second, it is hard to target for many people as the horses head is in the way.  There are tricks around this by going into gnome form or invising (both move the head out of the way).<br>
<br>
Changes with The Planes of Power<br>
<br>
The Planes of Power came to the EQ world in 2002.  This cemented a broader high end game and extended many of the issues that were seen in Luclin.  There are additional spells that are available in this expansion.  There were additional AA capabilities and a raising of the maximum level to 65.  Also, stats can now exceed 255 and multiple tradeskills can be raised to 250.<br>
<br>
For the Enchanter, the main change has been the completion of the shift to slowing as the number one issue for grouping.  Groups will try to operate without mesmerization crowd control, but will not without slowing.  This means that Shamen and Enchanters compete for groups.  This is exacerbated as one moves higher in the PoP hierarchy.  In Tier 2 and beyond planes, xp grouping is built around groups with maximum Damage Per Second (DPS).  It is rare that both a Shaman and an Enchanter are in the same group.  This was not really a consideration in the past, but it is now.<br>
<br>
This whole DPS issue raises its head in its largest form as one faces the Trial of Execution.  This Trial is used to get a &quot;flag&quot; that unlocks entry to the Planes of Valor and Storms.  In order to get this flag an event that requires 17 mobs to be killed is done.  This event can only be done by a single group at a time.  This group requires enough DPS to kill 55+ level mobs in about 30 seconds.  Needless to say, this caused people to evaluate how groups were put together and what made them tick.  Rogues, Rangers, Beastlords, Necros, Wizards, Magicians and Monks all fall into the high DPS classes.  Clerics are still the primary healers, although with the addition of mini-Cheals Druids and Shamen are much more capable.  Paladins and Shadow Knights are the preferred tanking classes as they have significantly better aggro control than Warriors do.  Shamen and Enchanters are slowers.  Most groups are formed with 1 Tank, 1 Healer, 1 Slower and 3 DPS slots.<br>
<br>
There are several extensions of spell lines and some new spell lines as well.  I am covering only Enchanter specific spells, so will not discuss the Imbue series.<br>
<br>
Mesmerization - Apathy (61), Word of Morell (62), Sleep (63) and Bliss (64)<br>
These spells are follow-ons to Glamour of Kiznatz with a -10 Magic Resist in them.  Any Tier 2 plane action requires at least Apathy.  There are places where Sleep is required.  Bliss can mesmerize mobs up to level 67 (if they are mezzable).  Lucy (lucy.fnord.net) is the best place to look at these.<br>
<br>
Word of Morell is in its own category in a way.  Mobs over level 55 are generally unstunable, thus rendering the &quot;Color&quot; series useless.  Word of Morell is a replacement for that series with a PBAE mezz.  Its dangerous to use in the planes with stuff hitting that hard, but it is a workable fast stun.<br>
<br>
Charms - Beckon (62) and Command of Druzzil (64)<br>
These are ways to solo in the planes.  Tier 2 and higher charming requires Command of Druzzil.  It originally had a large negative Magic Resistance, but this was recently nerfed.<br>
<br>
Mana Buffing - Tranquility (63) and Voice of Quellious (65)<br>
These are in the KEI series each with a bit more mana regen, mana pool adder, and Int/Wis adder.  The downside is that they only last 1 hour and 20mins without any buff extenders.<br>
<br>
Haste - Speed of Vallon (62) and Vallon's Quickening (65)<br>
These are basically the same form in single and group form.  They are a small upgrade from Visions of Grandeur.  However, they do not stack with the monk epic.<br>
<br>
Personal Shield - Shield of the Arcane (61) and Shield of Maelin (64)<br>
These are upgrades in our self only buff line.  In particular, there is a good amount of Magic Resist in these spells.<br>
<br>
Rune - Rune of Zebuxoruk (61) and Arcane Rune (61)<br>
Rune of Zebuxoruk is an upgrade to Rune V and is not bad.  Arcane Rune is perhaps the best spell enchanters ever get.  It is a self-only, componentless, 1500 point Rune.  Given the aggro that is drawn slowing in the Planes, this spell provides basic survival.<br>
<br>
DoTs - Strangle (62) and Torment of Scio (63)<br>
Strangle is good upgrade to Asphyxiate a lot more damage.  Still not great damage dealing but, better.  Torment of Scio adds a significant damage upgrade to Torment of Argli. Together these spells have a 150pt DD, 112pt DoT/tick and Mana Drain 45/tick.<br>
<br>
Illusions - Night Dark's Terror (63) and Illusion: Froglock (65)<br>
Night Dark's Terror is a major upgrade of Boon of the Garou.  It can easily be placed on multiple group members and has a bit more Dex.  Illusion: Froglock is a humorous way to travel Norrath.  It grants no real benefits.<br>
<br>
Tash - Howl of Tashan (61)<br>
Upgrade to your basic single up Tash.<br>
<br>
Root - Greater Fetter (61)<br>
Its a nice upgrade as it has a -30 Magic Resist built in.  Its also fast casting.<br>
<br>
Aggro Control - Boggle (61)<br>
An underrated spell that reduces hate and has a very fast cast time.  The hate removed is just for the enchanter and thus the MAs hate is not wiped, like with a Memory Flux.<br>
<br>
Lull - Pacification (62)<br>
Its not a bad upgrade to Pacify as the lull line is better than it used to be, but not as good as it was with the long time frame.<br>
<br>
Group Magic Resist - Guard of Druzzil (62)<br>
A nice upgrade to GMR.<br>
<br>
Enchanter Pet - Aeldorb's Animation (62)<br>
Our final pet.  Its not bad, it will never tank or be huge DPS.  Chanters in the planes get hit a lot.  Having a pet helps with DPS.  Given that they don't break mezz, why not have one up?<br>
<br>
Damage Absorption - Uproar (63)<br>
An upgrade of Bedlam with the other components (+Str and -Agi) removed.  Its good for a single hit in a Tier 2 plane.<br>
<br>
Direct Damage - Insanity (64) <br>
An upgrade and a major one to our DD capability.  Dementing Visions and Chaotic Visions is so hard to get that most people are still on Dementia.  This spell does almost 2x the damage and at a much better Damage/mana ratio.<br>
<br>
There were two new categories of AAs added with PoP.  These fall into the &quot;additional statistics&quot; and &quot;new abilities&quot; categories.  With PoP statstics can now be above 255 and increase 5 per level.  So at level 61, your max of any statistic can now be 260.  Additionally, it is possible to adjust your maximum Intelligence to even a higher number.  Currently at level 65, with maximum AA support Intelligence can be 315.<br>
<br>
For the abilities category, there are some additional capabilities for some of the archetype abilities.  This changes the value (perhaps) of the Combat Avoidance (CA) ability, given an AA ability known as Lightning Reflexes.  This makes this ability significantly reduce the damage taken by Enchanters, when they draw aggro.  There are other notable PoP AAs and they are as follows:<br>
<br>
Total Domination (TD) - A controversial one.  This is supposed to make charming to be more effective.  The jury is still out on this and may be made moot by the nerf of Command of Druzzil.<br>
<br>
Eldritch Rune (ER) - Manaless Rune.  Does not stack with Arcane Rune, and is probably just an Emergency only ability.<br>
<br>
Project Illusion (PI) - Better for PvP servers or fun way to turn your friends into Froglocks....Froooaaaak!<br>
<br>
Hastened Gathering - This may make Gather Mana (a class ability) more useful.  Gather Mana brings the enchanter to full mana.  Hastened Gathering shortens the timer on the Gather Mana Ability.<br>
<br>
Changes with The Legacy of Ykesha<br>
<br>
There really were no high level changes with LoY when it was released in 2003.  This expansion was focussed on the midgame.  There were two new spells and some other nice features that are game wide (like double bank space).  The two spells are:<br>
<br>
Leviathan Eyes (44) - A nice Vision buff that includes Enduring Breath.<br>
<br>
Scryer's Trespass (52) - An upgrade to Theft of Thought.<br>
<br>
These come from relatively simple quests and are reasonably worth it.  The other spell change is that the NPC drop spells from Kunark, Velious and Luclin are now researchable.  This has helped make these much more available.  This has made Speed of the Brood an achievable spell from the Luclin era.  It is a group haste like the epic and reduces the need for the epic.<br>
<br>
A horse replacement came out called the Drogmor (generally called a lizard).  This got rid of the problem that the horses head presented.<br>
<br>
Summary<br>
<br>
So, thats it.  Fundamentally, Enchanters now are big groupers with the need for slow, haste, mana buffing and crowd control.  In some ways, we are more survivable than ever.  Charming has gotten a bit better, so soloing on a regular basis is actually possible.  We can deal more damage now than ever before, so our class is a bit more versatile.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=charmroxors>Charmroxors</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#330000>(4/19/03 1:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfaqs.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High Level Enchanter Guide </span><hr size=1> great guide astyd =)<br>

Pacification (and its line) is an EXTREMELY effective crowd control tool.   With Pacification working on up to  lvl 65 mobs, mind-boggling things are possible.<br>
<br>
A planar ability to control your animation:  At 63, enchanter can send animation to fight without ever being hit.<br>
<br>
Scryer's Trespass is an upgrade to Wandering Mind, NOT Theft of Thought.   When fighting primarily caster mobs, having both memmed means almost unlimited mana.<br>
<br>
Shamen and enchanters coexist rather well in groups.  The healing and buffing power of a high level shaman is massive.  Both classes can also add high DPS to groups.<br>
<br>
Project Illusion ability opens great questing possibilities to classes that have no Illusions of their own.  Far from a 'purely fun' ability.<br>
<br>
Eldritch Rune, which is 1500hp at 3rd rank, is an awesome survival tool.   Instant cast, no mana means it will save your life when a mob breaks through your Arcane Rune.  VERY important AA. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bregalad Alcarin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, High Elf Phantasmist, Xev &lt;Legends of Westwood&gt;<br>

Just a couple of comments.<br>
<br>
Pacification works great on mobs that can be Pacified.  I also got my first resist of this since resists changed a few months back (from a Crawler in PoV).<br>
<br>
If you have a Cleric in the group, I would argue that a Rogue/Ranger would be a better add than a Shaman.  Yes they are wonderful folks, but would rather have 110DPS.<br>
<br>
Sorry, thats nice that some race can now complete a quest but Project: Illusion is close to Metabolism on the list of AAs.<br>
<br>
If you can afford Eldritch Rune, you are likely to have over 75AA points.  For those chanters in their 40s-50s that this is meant for, that is a long way off.  In front of that ability would be the 18 points to Master + DC + MGB + whatever archectypes you wish to complete (call that 24 - 48 AA points) so we are a long way down the list.  Since its only once per 10 minutes, its a long way between life saves (about once per 6 - 8 pulls).<br>

<br>
For the first 6 AA, I recommend Run Speed 3 and Innate Charm 3. Innate Metabolism is for people with too many AA, I think.<br>
<br>
FYI, SCM3 effectively increases your mana pool by 20%.<br>
<br>
With PoP, your maximum Int is 355, at level 65 plus appropriate AAs. This is 255 + (5 levels x 5 Int/level) + (5 steps x 5 Int/Step for Plana Power) + (5 steps x 10 Int/Step for Innate Enlightenment).<br>
<br>
I'm a 65 cleric, and I regularly duo with a 65 chanter having 350+ AA. Our favorite spot is in Plane of Fire south of zone-in. He tashes then charms a big spider (having 30-35k HP). My job is to heal the spider (to reduce time spent recharming), and to keep the chanter alive during recharms (such as by rooting the to-be-killed mob, and healing or DivArbing the chanter as he runs past). We've gotten to be a pretty good team, and earn one AA per 90 minutes or so. <p><a href="mailto:dforthof@adobe.com">Forthoffer,</a>

Well its been about 3 months since I wrote this guide.  I reread it today and the commentary to it and wanted add some thoughts.<br>
<br>
First off is commentary about mezz.   It is still the best crowd control method available.  There are mobs in the planes that are not rootable and mezzing is #1.  This does not downplay the fact that Root is more likely to stick on a first application.  Root - Tash - Mezz - Slow might be the way to do effectively control an add.  The Crypt of Decay and the Plane of Tactics require effective Crowd Control.  They are places where a Shaman is not necessarily an effective substitute to a Chanter.  Finally for those just hitting the non-stun phase of life, remember Mezz is a great way to break a mobs spell casting...particularly for gating mobs (like the Scourge Hobogoblin in PoN).<br>
<br>
People have been spending a lot of time with AA.  The Defensive AAs of Lightning Reflexes 5 and Inate Defense 5 seem to work very well.  These are higher priority than they used to be.  I have Eldritch Rune 3 and have to say, that it is a lifesaver.  Its instant and can be used on the run.  I highly recommend it.  I also have Animation Empathy 3.  I prefer the 62 pet with SoV and NDT to a DC pet anyday.  Most groups have not run into a Chanter with AE3, but I believe its much more versatile than DC and the pet has higher DPS (imho).  He does not hit as hard, but hits very fast and procs like MAD with NDT.  That pet can solo slowed mobs below 50 without any healing.  Above 50, Uproar works pretty well (I soloed the guy who drops Soulstripper and that Mage Cloak several times in this config - also soloed US in Velks and all the nameds there that way).  I have not tried too many mobs above 55 soloing with the animation.  The view of Total Domination has gotten more negative over time.  I have put it near the end of the queue of things I want to get.<br>
<br>
Ornate Silk is now getting to be relatively common in the bazaar.  Pretty pricey still but there are 2 pieces of special mention.  The Bracelet (FT2) and the Pants (C4) are the best items of the bunch.  I am basically equipped with SS armor and the rest are small upgrades (and very expensive if purchased) to what I have.<br>
<br>
Spell Research has gotten to be a reasonable money maker.  Its possible to scan the bazaar periodically and find rareish pages at moderate prices.  The prices on the upper-50s - 60 rare drop spells is generally higher than anything short of level 65 spells (like Topor).  One should be able to pick up enough materials to get research leveled to 184 (49 spell trivial I believe) at a pretty modest price.<br>
<br>
Finally, I am really looking forward to LDoN.  Getting back to dungeon crawls will bring forward the Enchanter as the Premier Battle Management class going.  Some of my friends and I did the new Droga the other day.  The mob at the entry ran on us in a very strange way (up - not down) and we got lot of adds.  There were so many adds that I could not keep them all mezzed, they broke before I could get back to them.  But our MA went defensive and we all ran (and lived).  What fun to be mezzing like mad again (we had a 2 group setup in CT the other day in 4C pyramid and 2 of us managed a 14 mob pull - he he).<br>

I only recently upgraded to TD3 and im very happy with it.  I especially find it useful in the Tier II and above pop charm soloing.  My early charm breaks have gone down to a minimum compared to even TD 1.  I noticed it especially in PoTa.  My charms would constantly break early on the Diaku's even when I had TD 1.  But now with TD 3 I have seen a big change.  I wonder if people get TD 1 or 2 and judge the ability as poor, because there is a huge difference between TD1 and TD 3 IMHO.  Just my opinion.<br>

My main is a shammie and when I duel box and Tash/Malos the charm victim my charms last full duration nearly everytime. <p>Biggrol Paynebringer<br>
