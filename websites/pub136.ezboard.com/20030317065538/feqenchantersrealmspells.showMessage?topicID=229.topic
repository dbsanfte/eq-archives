<br>
I went on a raid with a new guild last night to Umbral Plains. I followed some of my &quot;standard strategies&quot;, most of which have stood me well for many levels. Every guild has its own approaches but I am trying to understand why these standard strategies didn't seem &quot;to work&quot; on this raid.<br>
<br>
Among the 24 or so raiders, we had two chanters, a level 60 and me (56). My experience in this situation is that the 60 handles KEI, haste, mezzing and slowing. That leaves me with less to do and more mana &quot;to play with&quot;---a bit, must be ready for backup mezzing, of course. <br>
<br>
QUESTION 1: chain-stunning<br>
<br>
I've always found chain-stunning to be an excellent way to assist in dropping mobs fast if I have the mana to keep it up. As long as resists aren't too often, I can usually take the occasional hit. On a multiple pull it's great too since the 60 mezzes the mobs and I stun. Stun doesn't break mez, of course but it sure does anger them. So when mez breaks, they are on ME, allowing the 60 to re-mez with little difficulty.<br>
<br>
But here, re-mezzing was not occurring so when mez dropped in these looong fights, the mobs were coming at me, requiring me to further aggravate them with more chain-stunning and leading to heavy cleric heals on me. Finally, I was told to cut out the stunning, since my cleric was going OOM on me. <br>
<br>
Okay by me since I don't need to add to my deaths total. LOL. But it seems to me that the chain-stunning approach works well in this situation. I think this guild just doesn't use stun much in combat since I had other raiders asking why I was casting on THEM...<br>
<br>
QUESTION 2: aoe nukes??<br>
<br>
In this kind of situation, where I have plenty of mana and another chanter is handling the critical stuff (i.e. crowd control) I like to load a DD or 2 and contribute to nuking. But here I was told my nukes were breaking the mezzes on non-targeted mobs. (I was always assisting the MA, btw.) I know our nukes have a stun component and are high-aggro but never knew them to have aoe effects. Am I wrong here? (Pretty sure I am not but looking for confirmation. Maybe some kind of weird effect or bug in those Umbral caves...)<br>
<br>
Was a fun raid and I know every raiding party has its own style so I want to respect that. But I do want to get some perspectives from other experienced enchanters.<br>

<br>
I noticed that Stuns aggro rate depends on the mobs (Juggernauts in Seb will aggro you much more than some Sarnaks or Frogloks or...)<br>
<br>
Maybe the highest the mobs are, the more Stuns will aggro... High mobs are often immune to stuns tho, so...<br>
<br>
If you have problems with aggro, just load AE MemBlur and Single Target Memblur, so you won't have any trouble when mez break.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enchanters have only 1 AE nuke so far : Gravity Flux...<br>
So if you use the Dementia spell line, that should be ok. Just wait for the mobs HPs to drop down to 40% so you can nuke 2 or 3 times.<br>
<br>
Just keep in mind to do not disturb the MA's aggro job, so when the Raid leader calls for nuke you can go for it. Else don't Memblur the main target or so, that would mess up the whole raid;<br>
<br>
Good luck on your future raids<br>
<br>

They have a lot more hitpoints which make getting aggroed a lot easier, and you being 56 your lower level for that zone so sadly things aggro on lower mobs that hit them, its like they get insulted by it or something LOL so AE stun is a big no no, cause that's way to much aggro for you for those two reasons. <br>
<br>
Another thing is i feel any enchanters that don't keep there mobs mezzed once the first mez isn't much of a enchanter in my book. Your there to crowd control, just mezzing them once and leaving them alone just don't cut it.<br>
<br>
Oh and no your single target nukes are not AE.<br>

We hang out in Kael, Maiden's Eye, and Seb.  (I've been doing this since I was 45 - now 47).  I've been in UP before too, but not often.  When i was there, we were killing elysians.<br>
<br>
1)  You MUST have an awareness of your proximity to all mobs if you're the baby of the group.  I rarely sit down in these places (but then again, I'm sporting KEI and PotG or Aego so i hardly run out of mana).<br>
<br>
2)  Communication with the group.  If I group with peeps I don't know (and well with peeps i do know), I try to get a general idea of how we're approaching mobs.  For example, root/dot, fear kite, slow/nuke/root, AE, etc.  If there's another chanty, I always ask what my role should be.  Sometimes I do end up slowing; it is totally dependent on where you're hunting and the type of mobs you're dealing with.  Some places are better to chain-stun than in others as well.<br>
<br>
3)  our nukes are not ae (except for Gravity Flux which is peanuts to the higher lvl mobs anyway).  although, this is something i have heard and not sure about.  if there are other untouched mobs nearby, you can aggro them and they will come running when you attack one of their buddies.  and of course, if you're a lower level, that leads you back to my first point:  be aware of all mobs around you.  nuking will not affect surrounding mezzed/rooted mobs though.  there must have been something else happening to break those mezzes, or perhaps it was a bug.<br>
<br>
I know I'm not a senior to you, but i can definitely relate to being the baby of the group.  When i get to 51 i am going to be begging to do ae.  i've seen it done a couple of times, and it looks cool.  who wouldn't like to be a part of all that carnage?<br>
<br>
btw, my role with my regular group is backup mez, root, tash.  then i'm free to work on my evocation skill <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I agree with nearly all points made here and I have just one thing to add.<br>
A few levels ago in seb I noticed that froggies were breaking alot more than usual.  The tanks/melee would be no where near them and it would be no where near break time.  I found that other frogs were dispelling each other... *shiver* the froggies are evolving. Perhaps this is happening with other mobs?<br>
    I have only done UP once but it might be a good idea to take a look at this problem.<br>

Ok, I think your questions were...what does the 2nd enchanter do during raids and what about Gravity Flux.<br>
<br>
Raids:  Well in your situation, I would say DoT the mob that the main tank is on if possible and back up mezz.  Don't stun the mob mezz it.  As for aggro control once you have done that, try a Memblur line of spells.  Sit aggro is big in these zones so standing on pulls or a horse will become almost necessary as you go on.<br>
<br>
Gravity Flux:  On most raids I keep a nuke loaded, Dementia.  Its good to have a nuke loaded for Gating mobs especially no stun no mezz mobs (read this as Giants and Dragons).  My guild does ToV regularly and nuking those bastages at the end is a requirement on gaters.<br>

If a mob is above 55, the only thing you can do is Glamour of Kintaz.  Color stuns, Largarn, nuke stun component - all they do is get you a lot of extra aggro without actually stunning.   Word of Morrell (62) might be a ble to stun higher mobs, though I am not sure.<br>
<br>
In general, enchanters on raids I go usually open a separate channel, and distribute duties.  Who does KEI, who hastes, who is responsible for pacifies, who does aggro management (blur/visages)  Primary mezzer is assigned, and so is backup mezzer.  Primary mezzer makes a hotbutton which is a tell to backup mezzer to assist.   (Say, a mez fails, and mob rushes primary, he'll mash assist button, and try to remez) Backup mezzer makes a hotkey that will /assist primary, and fire off a quick low-res mezz like Kintaz or better.<br>
<br>
If you are at a loss about what to do on a raid, either you have too many enchanters, or your raid organization could stand improvement.  <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bregalad Alcarin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, High Elf Beguiler, Xev &lt;Legends of Westwood&gt;<br>
