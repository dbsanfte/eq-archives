   My opinion is Apathy has to be the worst mezz spell ever given to a chanter.Apathy has something not many other mezz spells have - the chance to be resisted and that chance is pretty darn good.Any other mezz throughout my career has never been resisted to my recollection,and casting this for the first time only to see it resisted was a real letdown.Not only resisted but as a perk I drew aggro from the mob I casted on in such a way that even the pally in group had a hard time peeling the mob off me.Everyone in group was convinced I cast tash and cripple in order to gain that much aggro and when I told them it was my new mezz spell,I recieved a unanimous opinion that Apathy was best left in the trash spell pile lol.<br>
<br>
    Maybe this spell has its uses and for the time being until I get my next mezz spell I will use this on occasion for CC.But I wont cast until I root and tash from now on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kiadorin>Kiadorin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#330000>(9/27/03 9:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=320.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Apathy Sux</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Apathy has something not many other mezz spells have - the chance to be resisted and that chance is pretty darn good.Any other mezz throughout my career has never been resisted to my recollection<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Don't blame the spell: Apathy's resist adjustment is just as good as or better than any other single-target mez in our book, excluding the Rapture line.<br>

  As for me being uber as you state,I just checked Lucy and Rapture has a  -1000 adjustment to resists while Apathy has only a mere -10.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kiadorin>Kiadorin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#330000>(9/28/03 10:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=320.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Apathy Sux</span><hr size=1> Yes, Rapture is a special case, so I excluded in the statement above.

It still floors me that you had never had a mez resist before.

   <br>
    Was in LDoN this evening using both rapture and apathy side by side for overpulls since many tanks dont know what the word Lull means.Over the course of the 90 minutes we were inside not once was Apathy resisted,but then again the mobs we faced were somewhat lower in level than the mobs I faced a few days ago when making this post.<br>
<br>
    The mobs I faced a few days ago were in the mistmoore theme and at that time I was at lvl61 the lowest level in group.The remaining 5 members were all 65 thus the mobs tended to be Dark Blue or occasionally White to me when conned.<br>
<br>
    Today I was matched at 61st with 2 other toons of the same level and 3 remaining characters between 55 and 57 - all mobs in dungeon were D.Blue.Again like I said not once was Apathy resisted and I especially made sure to watch the workings of the spell this evening.Keeping Arcane Rune up helps considerably,and believe me in 90 minutes time testing different spells on varying mobs I recast AR at least 10 times.<br>
<br>
    Another word lost to many tanks is Taunt - after 10th level they forget how to do it.Believe it or not I was actually grouped in PoI a few levels ago with a Warrior that told me his Taunt skill was at 34.His excuse was that Warriors dont have the ability to peel mobs off of casters after level 50 so he didnt bother increasing skill.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
   One of the things I notice is that LDoN seems to be more of a special case than most other areas.Take a normal mission for your level and the mobs will have the same resists as mobs in any other area.Take a hard mission and the mobs themselves are not only slightly more difficult by having increased levels and hp,but also have higher resists,and many more that are totally immune to cetain effects.It is very possible the group of 65's I was with choose a hard mission thinking the levels would be thrown off in thier favor by taking someone lower in level then they were,perhaps thinking this would be to thier advantage.The Bard in group although lvl 65 was not able to charm mobs for instance,this fact was lost to me at the time and I didnt think about it.For a level 65 to have charm resisted by a mob that was charmable in a different group with different levels should have tipped me off to the problems I could face.<br>
<br>
   As for my ability to not have many mezz's resisted,this may also be due to the fact I try to have ALL stats buffed to max while on an adventure.Early on in my career I learned that charisma is supposed to effect roots and mezz's in addition to charms.My charisma is average 218 while in a group,in fact the only stat I allow to slip under 100 without thought is strength and that is at 84 unbuffed.Intell has been my prime concern and I have had that maxed at 255 for some time.<br>

Should go for 250+.   At 65, depending on weather I need resists on not, I have Cha between 253 and 280.<br>
<br>
LDoN mission difficulty is directly related to group level average.   If average is 63+, you have a lvl 65 adventure.   If average is less than 63, but over 58, you have a lvl 60 adventure (they come in 5lvl increments).  A lvl 65 adventure will have mobs in 58-61 range, named being 63-64, and if it's an assassination mission, boss will be 66-67.  'Hard' setting bumps mission to next difficulty setting.  I am sure your groupmates did not pick a Hard setting.  65 Hard has lvl 64 regulars, hitting for 800+ (think BoT named hard), and you need at least Sleep to mezz there.<br>
<br>
Look up on Lucy.  Check out your lower level mezzes.  You may notice all your pre-50 mezzes, including Dazzle, having NO resist adjust at all.  If you indeed never had any mezz resists on the way to 60, you either have exceptional luck, or bad memory, or haven't done CC in places that have resistant mobs.  Apathy, like GoK before it, and Sleep/Bliss after it, has a -10 adjust, meaning it has BETTER chance to land anth any of your pre-50 mez.  In fact it's my mez of choice in LDoN.  There's nothing mezzable above lvl 62 in a lvl 65 normal adventure.   <br>
Rapture is a separate case.   It has a much shorter duration, and it has a huge recast time as a penalty for its massive resist adjust.  Also, Rapture will not work on mobs above 61.<br>
<br>
Aggro: the fact that Apathy resist produced so much aggro has to do with your level.   ANY mezz is a heavy aggro inducer when resisted, and you being 4 levels lower than others in group makes you an aggro magnet already. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bregalad Alcarin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, High Elf Coercer, Xev &lt;Legends of Westwood&gt;<br>

Couple of other things you might try.<br>
<br>
First, if there is only 1 add and they are dark blue to white at 61 why would you not use Rapture.  However, what do you do if there are 2 adds?<br>
<br>
How about: Greater Fetter (with its -30 Magic Resistance adjustment), Tash, then Apathy.<br>
<br>
Yes, its painful.  <br>
<br>
Alternately one could say:  I am going to get hit and lead with Tash and try to channel through the Apathy.  Assuming you have Arcane Rune up, you should have several rounds of combat to get through.  Since you have 65s with you, I assume you are virtued.  You can add in the Bedlam series of spells and take an additional hit.<br>

<br>
I have a question about this comment... are you saying that the tank is not assisting? It is the tank that chooses the initial target, are you just picking a mob at random to mez?<br>
<br>
Personally, I assist the tank on incoming (especially when it's an SK pulling with a snare/dot) and switch targets to mez. Then if there is more than one mezzed mob I will let the tank know which to target next.<br>
<br>
As for the mez I use, my mez of choice is Sleep, as Bliss seems to be resisted more often. I never did like Rapture, but as I was unemployed over the summer I just zoomed right through having to use it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=587371" target="top">Fyrewytche Emberheart</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Officer of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub22.ezboard.com/binnoruuksdarkmaidens" target="top">Innoruuk's Dark Maidens</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/?locationid=US-TX" target="top">My local time</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Wow. I even went for CHA and INT fairly early on, at the expense of AC and HP. I couldn't guess at how often my wiley ways have been resisted over my lifetime. It's a lot. My trade-off gave me a debatable to slightly better chance at mezz, though I've read anything above 200 in either really doesn't add much. <br>
<br>
All raids I've been on have a specific tank and healer type assigned to keeping enchanters alive/off-tanking mez resists to allow the enc time to gain control. In Crypt of Decay, I was a main CC'er and knowingly level low. It was a given I was going to get resisted so a complete heal druid was assigned to me prior to the encounter, I was his sole target. We had an extra healer and it was important I be given the chance to channel through and land mezz. Messy, but it worked. Groups typically watch the enc calls closely. We're important and any force worth its salt will do what-ever they can to keep you alive to do your job. If you've never gotten resists and thus never gotten to receive this tender care until now, you're the exception, not the rule. <br>
<br>
Back to the point though...<br>
<br>
I'd guess I've had better luck in LDoN with mezz than I had in Tier 1 planes. I think this is mostly because I'm ten levels higher than when I was whimpering in Plane of Innovation. Experts correct me if I'm wrong here, but I *think* a lvl 61 enc casting Dazzle will land more often than a lvl 55, yes? Level of enc vs lvl of mob makes a big difference.<br>
<br>
All the groups I've been in (post 55 when people should know what they're doing) are quite emphatic about assist. A group member who breaks mezz more than twice usually finds themselves being reprimanded at least and replaced if they still refuse to get with the program. Now, there is a special case and really a tough call, this has happened to me in PoV a lot...<br>
<br>
At 61, I'm really at the border of effective on crowd control. Two come in, Mob_2 resists mezz. The MA knows this because mob_2 is making a beeline for me, so they switch targets to try to keep me from getting killed. I MIGHT be able to channel through the pummeling though and get mob_2 mezzed. MA though is honestly trying to keep me alive...breaks mezz on the next swing, now mob is REALLY ticked off. MA might be able to get mob_2 off, but cleric's mana is low pumping my dumb weak butt up. It's a very tough call...if MA doesn't switch targets, you might be upset they did nothing to help. If they do switch, you might be upset they broke mezz.<br>
<br>
Talk to your tanks, let them know what you feel your limits are. Do you want them to off-tank resists? Now that you're getting resists, you'll have to make a hot key, &quot;%T is crushing my head! It's crusing my head!&quot; or do you want them to stay on target and let you sort it out?<br>

I have had tanks try to save me from adds.  I think people stopped doing this in my low 60s.  I pointed out to them that an Enchanter generated more aggro more rapidly than they can regain it, so let me channel through.   I still have time for Mezz (resist), Mezz (resist), Eldritch Rune, Tash, Mezz.<br>
<br>
Biggest issue I have had is clerics/healers that don't understand the tactical situation.  The worst message I can see on a resisted mezz is: &quot;Complete Heal incoming for Main Tank in 10 seconds&quot;.  Good clerics learn that CHeal is effective once Crowd Control is in effect.  Before that, fast heals are required.<br>
<br>
I have 2 alts a Cleric and an SK.<br>
<br>
After playing a Chanter so long, its hard to play a Cleric.  We watch different things at different points in battle.  Chanters prime role is a high intensity burst at beginning of a battle.  Clerics are required a lower intensity but constant role throughout a battle.  I generally use my fastest and smallest heal on enchanters (Ethereal Remedy, is the name I think).  I only use HoT on them when I am sure that they are no longer under attack.<br>
<br>
The SK is interesting as many enchanters try to mezz my pulls (and I generally pull with Snare but not always).  Its a bit more active during the battle due to positioning issues and aggro control.  Biggest issue that I see tanking is that most folks in their 50s (and my SK is 56) don't understand the riposte issue of mobs and position themselves properly.  In LDoN, generally I prefer to off tank single adds (i.e. we have 2 mobs).  I think that this is more effective than 1 at a time.  I see crowd control as a 3 or more on a pull issue.<br>
<br>
Playing the 3 classes has really deepened my understanding of group dynamics.  Between that and studying the capabilities of other classes, I think I am a much more effective enchanter.<br>
