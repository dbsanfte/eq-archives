Igbert's Guide to Charm Solo'ing <br>
49th Chanter <br>
Rodcet Nife <br>
<br>
I successfully solo'ed my enchanter from level 40 to level 49 in a matter <br>
of 4 weeks. <br>
This was basically one weekend day, and 3 or 4 evenings for a few hours per <br>
week. Not a ton of time really. Some people say enchanters are horrible at <br>
solo'ing (I played a rogue to 50, trust me, enchanters are wonderful <br>
soloers). I would even go so far as to say enchanters MAY be the best <br>
solo'ing class around. My backing is that solo'ing is all about damage <br>
output and (avoiding) damage input. For casters damage output is about mana to damage <br>
efficiency. Damage input is almost irrelevant because a casters job (even <br>
in soloing, is to not get hit). Given the right circumstances (which I'll <br>
discuss), the charm spell is the most mana to damage efficient spell in the <br>
game. A charmed 45th level mob puts a mage pet to shame. Especially considering<br>
such a mob can be weilded by (theoretically) an enchanter of 39th level.<br>
<br>
I've also read the laments of enchanters saying that charm is a death trap. <br>
As I said, I leveled 40 through 49 with almost no grouping and just charm <br>
solo'ing. I died 3 times in that entire time. Once because of linkdeath <br>
(which is incredibly dangerous in a charmed scenario) and the other two <br>
times because my pet hit me and I had a bad string of 3 successive stuns. <br>
Three rounds of combat from my pet was enough to drop my rune and kill <br>
me. <br>
There are two thoughts associated with that. One is, don't let your pet <br>
hit you for 3 rounds . And two, despite I'm a pretty wimpy little <br>
enchanter, 3 rounds of combat that can kill me must be doing some very serious <br>
damage. <br>
<br>
First I'll list the absolute required ingredients for successful charm <br>
solo'ing for me. I'm sure other recipes work, but this is my success list. <br>
I'll then describe some very specific scenarios. <br>
<br>
1. SoW. I hate this requirement and that's why I list it first. Mostly <br>
because enchanters don't have it naturally, but despite my disdain, I <br>
cannot see my way around it. Jboots work fine. Enchanters have little <br>
trouble trading clarity to a solo'ing druid for sow and potions aren't <br>
that <br>
expensive. Sad but true - you must be able to outrun your pet. <br>
<br>
2. A wide open zone. Along with SoW, you need to be able to run. And <br>
Outrun. You &quot;can&quot; rely on your color-stun spells and charm indoors (getting that <br>
wonderful xp bonus) but that really is just too dangerous. You are <br>
accepting the fact you'll get hit once in awhile. I've gone killing 30 <br>
mobs without getting hit once (even my rune). Outdoor zones are solo'ers dreams. <br>
The zone should also have some dead area where chance of getting jumped is <br>
minimal. Trakanon's teeth is outdoor, but the whole zone is ambush <br>
nightmare. <br>
<br>
3. A high-level mob undercon near many normal conning blues. At level 43 <br>
I solo'ed BOTH the kromrif guards in eastern wastes that stand in front of <br>
Kael. My 55th wizard friend lamented he barely had enough mana to do one. I <br>
could do both simultaneously. It was a dance but I could do it. They conned <br>
white or yellow at that time. I did it, but it was inefficient. Efficiency <br>
is everything, not dramatics. When those two guards fought each other, <br>
they pretty much beat the snot out of each other. Huge hitpoints and huge damage <br>
output. Once my pet won, I'd blast him to kingdom come. This cost me tons <br>
of mana for 2 kills. I learned quickly that by charming one guard, he could <br>
kill 10-15 dire wolves, walrus, snow griffons, giant scouts, etc before <br>
dying. While he was killing, I was medding. I rarely went below 60 mana <br>
until the time he was almost dead and had to zap my former pet dead. Trust <br>
me, this is the key to efficiency - your pet should be very tough and <br>
should kill many, many low blues. As solice to my wizard friend, I could not (and<br>
still cannot) solo one of those guards.. only two .<br>
<br>
4. The mobs you will kill (and charm) are not casters. Fighting casters <br>
is always a pain. They simply put out too much damage too fast and ignore <br>
your runes. Chanters are all about controlling melee fights. Stick to it. <br>
<br>
<br>
That's really it. That's what you need to get going. Your spells are all <br>
you need after this. <br>
Firstly, I'll describe levels 43-49. I'll describe earlier levels <br>
subsequently, because charming lower lev mobs is easier. It is easier because of one <br>
very important factor. The casting time of Beguile (which works on up to <br>
39th level mobs) is 3.5. The casting time of Cajoling whispers (which works <br>
on up to 45th level mobs) is 4.5. That casting time is incredibly <br>
important. <br>
<br>
The absolute, number one, most IMPORTANT rule of charming is: <br>
(pardon the caps, but this really is important) <br>
<br>
DON'T EVER BE NEAR YOUR PET. EVER. <br>
<br>
(I don't care if he cons amiable, its a lie, he really wants to rip your stinky little <br>
gnomish guts out, eat you, and poop you out tomorrow) <br>
<br>
The two times I died occurred when my pet unfortunately broke charm in <br>
the 5 seconds per hour that circumstances had me standing by my pet. <br>
<br>
Simple rule: If your pet is fighting - you are standing OUT of charm/root <br>
spell range medding. You have your pet targeted, your mouse cursor on your <br>
root spell, and your fingers on the CTRL-S keys ready to stand up. <br>
<br>
If your pet is NOT fighting - you are running with your pet chasing (slowly <br>
losing ground) to your next target. <br>
<br>
The enchanters that sit medding with a 45th level Frost Giant pet standing <br>
near them are the ones that say charm never lasts and is suicide. <br>
<br>
By the way ? I did this successful charming episode with 170 INT and 115 <br>
CHA (buffed). Charms lasted anywhere from 6 seconds to 5-6 mins <br>
(estimated). Any charm over 30 seconds is useful. Charm Breaking is not <br>
really a problem. If you aren't ready for it, you die. If you are, its <br>
just the cost of doing business. <br>
<br>
Ok.. Spell line up from 43-49. <br>
<br>
1. Tash <br>
2. Direct Damage <br>
3. Root ? (not immoblize, not enstill.. your 8th level Root ? there's a <br>
reason, read on) <br>
4. Fastest Haste <br>
5. Tepid Deeds (not shiftless deeds, tepid) <br>
6. Rune III <br>
7. Cajoling Whispers <br>
8. Memblur <br>
<br>
<br>
Notice I use root and tepid deeds instead of better spells. Root casts <br>
in 2.5, immobilize (39th) in 1.8. For this reason, you may choose immobilize,<br>
BUT you will rarely, if ever cast direct damage on a rooted mob. You don't <br>
care if root breaks. Generally, you WANT roots to break quickly. If there <br>
was a 20second sure-hold root, it would be perfect. Also, you'll cast alot of<br>
roots and the mana savings adds up.<br>
<br>
Tepid slows 50% - shiftless 60%. You will hardly use this spell anyway. You <br>
shouldn't fight too many mobs that pose a challenge to your pet. Tepid is alot<br>
less mana than shiftless. Really not worth it here imho. Generally, <br>
spells 5 and 8 (memblur) are optional. If you wish to put Gate there, <br>
that's a good choice. Another type of root (enstill is longer than root) <br>
for situational use is good too. Also mez if you aren't doing giants. <br>
<br>
Buffs: The only buffs I keep up are Shielding, CHA buff, and Rune III (and <br>
Clarity duh). Rune 4 is just too dam expensive (10 Rune 3's per Rune 4 <br>
in casting cost). If you are rich, go for 4. Also, keeping up Troll Illusion <br>
isn't a bad idea if you get hit - the regen is nice. Of course, last but <br>
not least - Sow (or jboots). Buy potions, give druids backrubs, whatever. <br>
Its required. <br>
Shade is ok, but I don't really get hit much. And when I do, Runes eat <br>
it up. Resist magic could be very real, but fighting casters isn't a good <br>
idea anyway. <br>
<br>
Ok.. Here is my charming scenario levels 43-49. <br>
<br>
Zone: Eastern Wastes <br>
Important points: Kromrif guards outside Kael can easily be pulled solo. <br>
Just north of Kael is a &quot;dead&quot; zone&quot; there seem to be no wandering <br>
monsters there. Just east of Kael there are tons of wandering blue mobs. <br>
Kromrif guards conned white to me while 43, 44, 45. They seem to vary these <br>
levels. Also, Cajoling Whispers (according to eq.castersrealm.com) charms <br>
only up to 45th level mobs and I never had a problem charming these guards. <br>
<br>
Medded to full, buffs on as indicated above, spell line up as above. <br>
<br>
Steps: <br>
1. Walk down ramp, as far away as possible, tash a guard - run up ramp. <br>
Note that tash is uber important. MR is what seems to matter for broken <br>
charms, not CHA. When my tash spell wears off, I expect a charm break soon <br>
after. <br>
2. After traveling past top of ramp awhile, turn, wait one sec (so as to <br>
not be spell interrupted) and cast root. <br>
3. If root is resisted (not often with tash) run north to dead area. <br>
Side slip, run past trees, jump - whatever it takes to gain some ground on the <br>
very upset giant. When you get ample distance, try to reroot (use 3rd <br>
person view camera liberally to check distances). <br>
4. Once pet is rooted, cast charm. Recast until it sticks. (resists are about 20%<br>
for me I'd estimate).<br>
5. If root is still holding (likely), approach pet and cast your haste <br>
spell on him (spell range is much smaller than charm). If root is not <br>
holding, head southeast towards mobs. Worry about hasting him once he <br>
is fighting. Since this will be your pet for the next 10-20 minutes, you can <br>
remove the haste spell from your list and replace it with something else if <br>
you like. <br>
6. If root still holds, go south east and find some prey. Target it and <br>
tash it. Run back to your rooted pet hitting your hotkey &quot;/pet attack&quot; <br>
when near him. Try not to get too close to your rooted pet. Once past pet, <br>
turn and root target near the pet. It is important that during the fight, <br>
you keep the target mob rooted. That way, when charm breaks (not if) you <br>
only have to deal with a free mad pet, not two mad mobs. Also, I did group <br>
some with druids during this. Their snare made recharm a snap but I felt <br>
constrained getting my pets to new locations. However, their tracking is <br>
incredibly useful in finding the next mob. EW is great because there are <br>
LOTS of mobs, a sparser zone would be annoying. Nothing is more frustrating running<br>
a long way with a charmed mob in tow - you know the charm is begging to break.<br>
7. While pet is fighting target mob, head out of root range and med <br>
watching the battle. Keep your PET targeted (F1 twice) and your fingers on <br>
CTRL-S to stand up. Also your mouse on the root casting icon. Some battles, <br>
your pet will not break charm and you simply get the kill. If he does <br>
break, stand up, root, and recharm. If anything is resisted, start running <br>
and try again. Sometimes, you will lose an almost dead mob because of an <br>
unfortunate charm-break and resists but don't worry about this. Start <br>
working on the next mob, such losses are rare. Also, if the target mob <br>
breaks root during the fight, you can reroot him. If he is almost dead, <br>
don't bother. The best way I've found to reroot is be out of root range and<br>
start madly clicking the root casting &quot;spell gem&quot;. Once he enters range, it<br>
will start casting. I tried making a hot key &quot;/sit off&quot; then &quot;/cast 3&quot; but<br>
that meant I had to guess I was in root casting range.. too iffy. <br>
8. Eventually, you'll have two mad mobs chasing you. If both are giants <br>
(kromrif ex-pet and say a scout) then they are fast runners and you must simply do <br>
some creative rooting to get things under control. Remember, the northwest <br>
area is your friend (just NW of kael entrance), it's a wide open uninhabited area with plenty of room <br>
to root. If the target mob is a manticore or dire wolf, they are slow. <br>
Run awhile, root your ex-pet, then root your target next to him. Even though, <br>
neither is charmed they will fight! They still have each other on their <br>
hate list. If your uncharmed giant kills the target mob ? it will poof! <br>
Don't let that happen if possible, recharm asap. <br>
9. Once your pet gets hurt enough. Tell him to sit. Then cast invis on <br>
yourself and blast him a few times to get that kill too. There is a nasty <br>
bug that an almost dead mob will warp back to his starting point. This <br>
does happen to these guards and its quite a bother. Blasting my pet is what <br>
really eats mana. A kromrif guard with only a sliver of health still seems <br>
to take a few 44th DD's to bring down. <br>
<br>
Other topics: <br>
========== <br>
<br>
Memblurring for xp: <br>
Its said that if a pet does over 50% of the damage, it gets 50% of the <br>
kill. So, you can try to outdamage your pet, but that's horribly mana <br>
inefficient (probably impossible once you see those kromrif guards quading <br>
for 130). Also you could call your pet off an almost dead target and <br>
memblur the old target. Wooly Rhino's start out indiff so on a successful <br>
memblur they go back to indiff. I can attest sometimes it has taken me <br>
4 memblurs to make that happen! I can then blast and (theoretically) get <br>
full xp for the kill. Keep in mind however, the entire time I am casting memblur <br>
(which has a long recast time) my pet is standing right next to me. A charm <br>
break then is deadly. To me, this has become not worth it. I typically <br>
don't personally damage my targets at all. Let the pet do the work and <br>
make up for it in volume. If memblur worked consistently, I might consider <br>
changing my tactics. <br>
<br>
Note that one kromrif guard has killed up to 14 (fourteen!) xp yielding <br>
mobs for me before being so damaged I needed to retire him. That's in a <br>
span of 10-15 minutes. I then med to full in a few more mins and go get the<br>
other guard!<br>
<br>
Poofs: <br>
<br>
Poofs suck. That is, you blast a mob for final kill and it disappears! <br>
No corpse, no xp. This happens because some other (non charmed) mob did more <br>
damage than you and is still alive. Scenarios: <br>
<br>
1. Your pet and target mob fight until almost both are completely dead. <br>
Then charm breaks. They both wander off because they are both at a sliver <br>
of health. They have both done 99% damage to each other. If you blast <br>
EITHER, it will poof. If you blast both, the first will poof, the second <br>
will not (because you killed the first who had the most credit for the <br>
kill!). The answer? Recharm your pet, blast the second (or let your pet <br>
kill it), then cast invis and blast your pet. You'll get both kills. <br>
2. Both your pet and mob are rooted. A moment before the target mob dies, <br>
your pet breaks charm. Because they are rooted next to each other, they <br>
still fight. If the target mob dies then, it poofs. Recharm immediately if <br>
possible. <br>
3. Your pet fights some mob almost to the death then breaks charm and <br>
chases you. Roots are resisted for awhile. By the time you get your pet <br>
under control, you are halfway across the zone and have no idea where the <br>
original target mob is. One battle later, you blast your own pet and he <br>
poofs. The old target mob (across the zone somewhere) still did more damage <br>
than you and got credit. The only solution here is to memblur your pet <br>
a few times and hope it works. <br>
<br>
Eventually, you'll lose a nice kill to a poof. Again, its part of the game, <br>
just say &quot;oh poop&quot; and move on. <br>
<br>
General other rules: <br>
<br>
Keep Rune up at all times. You are a silly person if you don't. <br>
<br>
If you are waiting for someone, need to do nothing, whatever - still don't <br>
let your pet near you. Tell him to &quot;/pet sit down&quot; somewhere and stand away <br>
from him. Or just keep running with him chasing far behind. <br>
<br>
Slowing mobs is not too important. You can, but if your undercon charmed <br>
pet is adequate it doesn't matter much. The final goal is have a pet that <br>
has a SLIVER of health left and kills as many mobs as he can before then. I <br>
slow manticores against my kromrif pet because they really do alot of damage. <br>
If you are full mana during mid-battle (often) then feel free. Full mana is wasted mana. <br>
<br>
The 35-43 game: <br>
-------------------- <br>
<br>
This just changes your spells and location. Also your tactics slightly. <br>
First off, change Cajoling Whispers for Beguile. Your DD is weaker but <br>
that isn't too important. You STILL must follow the rule of finding a mean pet <br>
to kill low blues. Iceclad works for this. The two giants standing at the <br>
bridge can kill dire wolves and snow dervish like no tomorrow. <br>
<br>
The most interesting change is in recharming. A Frost Giant takes about 4 <br>
seconds to get from just inside recharming range to splattering you across <br>
the snow. Beguile takes 3.5 to cast (Cajoling whispers 4.5). If you <br>
sufficiently outrun a mad ex-pet, can just rapidly click the Beguile spell <br>
until it starts casting and get the recharm intact just before he reaches <br>
you. It saves a lot of trouble in re-rooting. The bad news is that it truly <br>
does take you to the edge of do-ability. If the charm resists, you will <br>
likely get hit once or twice. <br>
<br>
Possible charming zones: <br>
<br>
+Levels 20-30: Griffins in the Karanas are a known undercon. You can charm <br>
a green griffin and do some fine damage with it. Karana's have nice dead <br>
zones hear the south water (don't get too close to guards) <br>
+Levels 35-40: Iceclad giants at bridge are nice pets. Plenty of dead zone <br>
near bridge and by water <br>
+Levels 38-45: Frost Giant fort in EW. Berzerkers are good, so is Frost <br>
Giant Captain. Dead zone south (same as &quot;dead zone north&quot; for kael <br>
entrance) <br>
+Levels 43-49: Kael entrance - kromrif guards. Dead zone north of kael <br>
entrance. This is Mecca. These giants can pulverize so many mobs that live<br>
just east.<br>
+Levels: 44+: Burning wood - no wonderful undercon but wasps work. Wurms <br>
are trouble because of their long necks. Dead zone by skyfire zone <br>
entrance. <br>
+Levels 30ish: Overthere: No definitive undercons, but plenty of room. <br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion: <br>
There you go. Charm-soloing is incredibly profitable in xp. Note that I <br>
rarely loot, I fill up too fast. These rules can be applied to druids too. <br>
They haste their pets BETTER than enchanters and their snare spells makes <br>
recharming a non-event. Wooly Rhino's in EW work well for a 40+ druid. <br>
<br>
Also, charm soloing is nowhere as near as boring as necro/mage soloing or <br>
root/nuke. It's a dance and you have to get good at it. Don't get attached <br>
to your pet either. He'll want to kill you in a minute or two. Switching <br>
pets midstream is great if the mana is high. Your pet is a walking piece of <br>
experience too. <br>
<br>
Lastly, I'd just like to say I played a rogue to 50 (my first primary) <br>
and it was 100 times harder than an enchanter. My enchanter at 43 could kill <br>
10 giants in 10 minutes. My 50 rogue couldn't kill one. Sure, sure, <br>
solo'ing is not a measure of power. Then what is? My rogue has died to a <br>
green that jumped him in the dreadland tunnel. I still see rogues shouting <br>
for groups, post 50, pre 50, etc. This game was built to level a caster and <br>
twink a melee for fun. That's not a horrible thing, I just wish it said <br>
that on the box. <br>

Personally I have had charm as a permenant spell since I was in my upper 20's in Cazic Thule, so it is good to see other chanters out there that are not afraid to use it and see it's power.<br>
<br>
As for chanters soloing with a pet and rune line, that is a viable option as well. Although I consider even rune III to be too pricy. I prefer to use the beserker line. Plain and simple, it's free. <br>
<br>
Oh and another tip for pet soloer's, If you really want your under armored, under healthed pet to truly lay waste about it, then go out and buy a bunch of gnoll hide lariets. Hand two of them to your pet, and watch the fun. Supposedly unlike magician pets, enchanter pets will not deal out duel weild damage unless you have a weapon to give to it, and buying some cheap proc weapons is much better than buying a FS sword in Cobalt scar because you don't have anything else. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  A level 49 pet, with Swift, beserker str, Shadow, 2 Lariets, and good use of fear, can kill wyverns all day long. <p>Slymie Ras <br>

<br>
How do you  do it?  I was killing in OT the other night, pet had Beserker Str, haste, Obscure, and mob was Slowed (Tepid) AND I was color stunning.  Beserker Str wore off almost immediately and I probably casted it 4 times in 20 seconds.  Even with color stunning the mob would get a hit in now and then.  When my pet died the mob still had 85% health.<br>
<br>
Charm-soloing got me killed pretty quick, but I know what I did wrong and I plan on going back and not doing it this time.  =)  Oh, and mez-kiting worked pretty well but uses a ton of mana.<br>

<br>
Imo casting berserker strength at that level is a waste of time and mana (Upgrade is Bedlam-lvl 57 spell that actually does something).<br>
<br>
At higher levels the ONLY way to solo is to charm because your animation simply sucks. All in all, pets are unreliable either way...I find soloing (at lower levels) more productive with root/dot/nuke, or just root/nuke if you think you might have to mez him along the way. But it is very mana costly. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br><center><img src=http://ladylimelight.homestead.com/files/legendlogo2final.jpg><html><h5></center>

First off I'd like to say that hasting a charmed MOB is about the worse thing one could do, but other then that the strategy seems sound and viable.  I also solo'd as an enchanter, but from 39-55 and i've found that an enchanters animation does not suck as much as one thinks.  It it quite capable of putting out as much if not more dmg then a necro pet given the optimal buffs and understanding of the MOB's you're fighting.  One place i've found that was good exp from 44-51 was in Skyshrine in the courtyard (that's right, an indoor zone).<br>
<br>
I'd start my day by buffing fully first, then walking into the Courtyard invised.  Standing in a spot near the door (due to the fact that pathing caused the first garg to path near the fountain before coming towards you) i'd mez the garg.  Next i'd put my pet up and buff him with the appropriate AC buff, haste, resist magic and rampage/berserker spirit (level dependent).  After my pet was fully buffed i'd tash the garg (due to Uber high MR in SS), Slow with Shiftless deeds to preserver rune shield (Rampage/berserker spirit) on pet as long as possible, then DOT the garg.  After mez broke from the DOT i'd root the garg in place to avoid him coming after me and give pet time to gain agro.  From there i'd back up a safe distance to sit and med while my pet proceeded to slaughter the garg.  About the time it takes to med back the mana from the cast you can recast runeshield on your pet and sit again to continue medding.  Most important is to have root ready to go to make sure the garg doesn't get to the gate cause if he does it's a quick trip to CS for you.<br>
<br>
After this I would systematically pull my way around the room making sure to pull the melee classes first because if you pulled a caster first and it decided to cast instead of coming directly for you then guess where you're headed next...CS again.  Once the melee is safely out of the way you can tash or slow (I prefer the attempt to slow first because it saves the initial rounds of combat on your pet's runeshield here.  Then move close to the spot where the casting MOB is to gain agro for a sec til you get root off.  Then back away again, let pet gain agro, sit and med.  This strategy worked great for me and eventually forced me to drag twinks over to SS to loot guardian and sentry armor as I eventually got tired of watching BP's and such drop with no one there to loot.<br>
<br>
Soloing as a chanter has many viable ways of becoming a reality, though personally I prefer grouping to keep my more important skills up to par.  I have also solo'd Sentient suits with this method as well as wyverns in CS so don't knock what a chanter can do.  You're only limited by your imagination. <p></HEAD>

Well, I just recently began charm-soloing with my 23 enchanter in LOIO and I am <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> loving it</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!  I see some Necro standing on the beach going: <br>
&quot;/pet attack&quot; &quot;/pet back off&quot; /pet sit down&quot; &quot;Lich&quot;, lather rinse repeat, lather rinse repeat.  <br>
While meanwhile I'm: &quot;Tashan, charm!  Tashan, root!  /pet attack!  Slow!  Root!  Color Flux!  Charm!  /pet attack!  /pet guard here!  Invis, Tashan, charm!  Root!&quot; <br>
Dodging and weaving and running circles and bending the surroundings to my will, muaha.  <br>
I know I'm still young at the point where I can tank for a couple rounds if the situation gets dire, and that in a few short levels the MOBs will simply hit to hard for that to be an option anymore.  Still I think its good to learn these soloing basics early on.  Here's what I did to prime myself:<br>
<br>
A) I got myself something nice and low blue, a MOB that wouldn't really pose a threat if he slipped my harness but enough to keep me on my toes.<br>
<br>
B) I took my new pet to some green MOBs and had him beat the snot out of them.  During one of these fights a weak little green goblin jumped me and I had some very cool practice juggling mez, root, and re-charm.<br>
<br>
C) Eventually I moved on to bigger MOBs and started practicing &quot;Pet swapping&quot;.  Where my original pet is low on health, so I tell him to &quot;stay&quot; and run far off to find a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> better</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pet.  When I find a new gobby or sarnak I invis up and charm the full-health one, who proceeds to beat on my former buddy (TWO can play at the traitor game!).  I did this very successfully tonight.  The chain finally ended when my pet killed the MOB and had very low HP left.  His charm broke and he started to slowly walk away.  One happy nuke later and he dropped like a stone, and I was one blue bub richer.<br>
<br>
Obviously as time and levels grow my fail-safe memblur will whither away into uselessness but even then I feel I can still enjoy this tactic.  I just love having people say &quot;Are you crazy?  Charm is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> suicide</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!&quot; and then having my exp. bar shoot up another notch.  I can't wait till I hit those Velious Giants and try this out on 'em.<br>
<br>
The Enchanter class is just amazing, I love the idea of manipulating everything to do my bidding!  <br>
/pet move my experience bar!<br>
<br>
Again, thanks for posting this!<br>

When i hunted in Frontier Mountains and LoIO, i often played late at night, when nobody was online.  So i found myself fear kiting(same concept as necro) with my animation.<br>
<br>
I leveled, off and on from 23-35 like this, and still sometimes use the method at 40(only instead of pet, use a warrior/pally/sk, they deal lots more damage)<br>
<br>
The &quot;dead zones&quot; that i used for this are near the giant fort in FM(to the right, by the rock), and in front of the pillars that go down to the underwater gobbo zone.  This worked great, and i don't think i ever died to a mob this way.<br>
<br>
Edit: thanks for the charm post, that gives me a new insight on my underused charm line.<br>

I used to solo in Frontier Mountains, killing high blues with fear/pet kiting.  Just keep pet hasted, dot the mob, and it's a good idea to keep a damage absorber on your pet(for when fear breaks). <br>
<br>
Pathing is also an important issue.  In FM the mobs all followed the same path to a spot where they would just walk back and forth while my pet beat it down.  You have to find these spots in the pathing.  There's a similar spot in Ill omen, by the lake, right in front of the pillars that go down to the underwater goblin fort thingy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zikudeadscale>ZikuDeadscale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#330000>(12/20/02 1:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfaqs.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a must read for soloing enchanters</span><hr size=1> always haste your charmed pets, if you are wearing HP gear, not CHA gear like a sucker, you will be able to channel that stun, otherwise, go back to LOIO/OT/DL/Velks and group up with the rest of the people who dont know how to play this game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=charmroxors>Charmroxors</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#330000>(4/12/03 12:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfaqs.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a must read for soloing enchanters</span><hr size=1> /bumping this old guide, seeing as a few had questions about charming below 60 and such.  <p>Charmroxors<br>

<br>
Several innaccuracies...<br>
<br>
<br>
#1 Pet only takes half of exp if you don't do ANY damage to it.<br>
#2 Pet takes 33.3% EXP unless you do 50% or more of damage.<br>
<br>
Okay, in EW I found that charming a Kromriff Guardsman, giving it two weps... and using your best haste spell is the way to go.  Then go out into the wandering area of eastern wastes, slow all mobs, and mow them down.  Each guardsmen you charm is worth about 20 mobs....  he tears em up that fast.  I was able to get several levels in EW in merely hours...<br>
<br>
The charm dual wield (optional) haste, slow method is more effective at high levels for me.  I have charm solo'd all the way up through PoN to PoV...  <br>
