I have a question on group tactics where you get an add. The warrior/puller has pulled a single in DL when he runs by another one that adds on. Normally I use entrance to attempt to mezz at the largest distance possible. I don't tash on the initial pull as I can't always get the mezz off in time before I'm getting hit. Five times in six that mezz goes just fine as everyone is assisting on the puller's main target. It is that one time in six where there is a problem. The mob usually comes over and starts hitting me. Most of the time I have Rune Shield up unless we have multiple healers. This gives me enough time to usually recover and use a chain stun (sometimes works and sometimes doesn't). The stun was resisted, and I was unable to get another spell off. On an add like this, what are some good tactics to use root/mezz, tash/mezz, tash/root, have the warrior hit all mobs at least a couple of times before shifting to the main target to possibly help me avoiding aggro all the time? I'm usually okay and actually rarely die, but there have been some close situations lately, and I would like to hear how others do this. <p>Caeelyena-39th High Elf Enchanter <BR>

NEVER RUN AROUND hehe, learned that the hard way.  but if you got a healer you can trust, i say keep trying to mez.<br>

Rooting the mob makes for crazy aggro.  The mob will ping pong between attackers driving your healer nutz.  If I was you I would root them till you get the feel of your group.  If its a good one that knows keeping you alive ensures life for the rest of the group then demem root and mem blur.  All your Mezzes have a certain blur element but never enough.  Mezz and blur and hopefully you will fall down far enough on the hate list.  AND dont sit down til melee has 3/4 down or u will get sit aggro).<br>

It just isn't worth the mana to cast it. Easier to find a good group. I also have figured out that hitting tash before mezz is not usually a great idea. Tash carries such a large taunt that they are often hitting on me before I mezz. A typical encounter is more like this now. <br>
<br>
Single pull, wait for the MA to achieve aggro and tash/slow at 80%. Don't sit down for 10 seconds or so.<br>
<br>
Double pull. Find out what the MA is hitting on, and attempt to mezz the other. If it doesn't work (about 1 in 5), try it again. By this time, if it doesn't work I'm usually getting beat on, so I spam my under attack key and that takes care of it with the MA switching targets. If possible, I color stun and then mezz but this is rarely successful at 42 as my color stun is just not long enough to recover, move away and then mezz. I think this will get easier at 44 with the longer color skew spell.<br>
<br>
Mem blur has been very ineffective even after being used twice on those 40 level mobs. The good thing is my defense is almost maxed now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I keep hearing players who aren't chanters talking about how cha helps mezzing. I thought it was only really effective on charms. I carry both int and cha gear on me and switch out the gear as needed.<br>
<br>
The key as always to not having problems is to get a good group.  <p>Caeelyena-42 High Elf Enchanter <BR>

Also, once you get the third stun, you can just partner....sk/chanter works best imho as the sk can heal himself and if he knows what he is doing is an excellent taunter...have him pull with arrows, tash as it is coming towards you and have him immediately snare..then stun away..have him fear if you get a stun resist..got very good xp that way.  <p><html><center><font face="annifont"><font color="8b008b">Wynde Hemply</center><br><center>54th Illusionist</center><br><center>Alliance of the Griffin</center><br><center>Tholuxe-Paells</center><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=256113"><center>My Gear</center></a></font>

Tash/stun/mezz sounds like a very viable option for me. Luckily I already have the spell color skew through research, so I'll have a longer lasting chain stun spell to use. In a good team, we rarely get adds, but we were chain pulling and generally had one being hit on, one mezzed and one being pulled. I'm just about to ding 43, so I'm hoping the resist rate goes down. Right now it is about 2 in 7. Thank goodness for rune. <p>Caeelyena-42 High Elf Enchanter <BR>

If mezz lands succesfully, just tash and slow. If it doesn't, use color flux (the lowest level one). You just have enough time to recast mezz. If done well, you stun and mezz, and only being hit once (no rune needed). But if stun or the second mezz is resisted, you should use another stun (color shift), tash, and then try to mezz again. <br>
 Also root is a good option if the mobs purchases you, but its better to learn how to use memblur (at higher levels, mobs can summon you, and that makes root useless). At 44 i think we have reocurring amnesia, which is a great single target memblur that saved my life some times... <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=87742">Massagran Menteaudaz</b></a>, lvl  55 Beguiler<br>

I talked with a high level friend of mine about groups he was in and tactics. He said he hardly ever saw the enchanter tash on a pull. Mezz has such a lower taunt than tash does. About one time in three a failed mezz will get the creature beating on me, and sometimes I can get a color line off, but it seems like many times I'm interrupted. This could just be the level (ding 43 btw). I think the best solution will be levels and the mezz resists should go down.<br>
<br>
Does anyone here think that AoE mezz is a good solution for more than one add? The couple of times I tried it (even with greens), I get a couple of resists and then I get nothing off. I have stopped using it for now. <p>Caeelyena-43rd High Elf Enchanter <BR>

But, in areas where I know that is not the case, I will pull out the ae-mez as an emergency mez. Before it wears off, tash the adds so that there is lower chance of any resists on recast. When the pull breaks down to a manageable size, root the adds and let the ae wear off then pick them off with single mez. Works great if you end up with a nasty pull deep in Chardok or such.<br>
<br>
Personally, I almost never tash first when mezzing adds, it only leads to a mob beating on me before the mez can be cast. Stunning draws more agro than necessary, so I never use that outside of AE unless I'm fighting a caster that has an awful ae rain (ie., Tae Ew lifedrinker /shudder) - in which case its not related to trying to mez them at all so moot point.<br>
<br>
Root is a last resort for when the mez isn't landing and I need to get distance. Train your cleric well so that they will toss a root on the mob if they see you getting smacked too much (more mana efficient for them to toss out a root than to throw heals or rez you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   - but for pity sake don't let the druid root heh)<br>
<br>
I never ever ever ask the MT to switch (maybe because I often fight with an SK and bard and dotting the mob is a common practice). That only leads to more chaos and confusion (that random_melee_01 who went to grab a soda without saying anything was afk and didn't see the switch call..). It's our job to nail that add or adds down -- the only exception being the mobs that cannot be mezzed. Knowing which mobs require GoK, require Rapture or cannot be mezzed at all is key to being prepared for what's incoming (I have my own personal cheat-sheet on these and use it constantly so that I avoid nasty surprises when possible). <br>
<br>
I find that more often than not, I'm using GoK over dazzle, mana inefficient as it is, simply because of the short recast time. If it doesn't land, I can recast it by the time the fail message has hit. That usually lets me get two mez attempts in before the mob gets within melee range, if I'm in a good position to see the pull incoming. If I get resisted more than twice, boom rapture time. While its on the short-mez, quick tash and root and back away -- let rapture fall and switch to a more lasting and mana efficient mez. <br>
<br>
As for the int/cha issue .. I've tried to keep those balanced as I've leveled, so that now I'm at 250int/255cha (buffed) and got there in stages - not favoring one over the other. I personally believe in the &quot;cha is a factor&quot; camp, but I have no real proof either way, only gut reactions based on what I've seen out of the luck of the random number generator heh. Levels definitely are key on the resists. <br>
<br>
Anyhow, that was a longer post than I intended and I hope someone finds it slightly useful or informative heh.<br>

I can mez trains of up to 12 to 15 frogs in Sebilis with dazzle and chain AE stunning.  The agro comment on ae stunning was interesting, but I feel it's negligable...root is far worse imho.  AE stuns have always bought me the time I needed, even in the revamped CT...agro is insane in there anyway so I have agro spells up and mem blurr, and I pray regularly hehe jk.   <br>
<br>
Another issue is maxing all your spell skills out so you can channel through being attacked.  If you have even one of your spell skills at a weak level I've found it effects you greatly.  Mez is conjuration based so check that skill out specifically.  I find that well over 70 percent of the time I can channel through agro.<br>
<br>
The mem blurr technique is very very good, but if you have an MT that knows what they are doing it's not mana efficient.   I personally go with agro spells over mem blurr series.  I love the new agro spells -- saved my arse many a time.<br>
<br>
In the end there are lots of ways to play an enchanter, and some really good advice on this board.  Another issue that you are running in to is the fact that 90 percent of healers don't know how to heal enchanters.  Especially in your low 40's I would say that goes way up.  It's only been since I was above level 55 that I was able to find clerics who knew how to time heals on a chanter, so just as you are getting your cc timing down at your level, your clerics are getting their healing timing down at this level too.<br>
<br>
Certainly sounds like you are off to a good start -- 2 resists in 7 is a bit high imho, so I would check your cha...higher cha may make it 1 resist in 7 which can make a huge difference -- even though it seems like a small  number.  I believe the actual figure is 5 percent fewer resists per 50 cha.  It's a small number, and results in 1 or 2 fewer resists in 10 mobs, but it's easy to get higher cha, and worth it imho.<br>

I have now hit level 50, and resists on mezzes are now about 1 in 30. The biggest difference now is that I can channel through the hits a good percentage of the time. I self-buff cha and have some okay cha gear. With buffs, my int is around a 199 and cha around 180. This will improve obviously as I move into the areas where better gear becomes available. I hadn't known that about tash although I usually tash a mob if we are bothering to slow it. We were pulling 6 to 8 at a time last night, and I was locking down all but the main mob in decent time (although I'm still not using AoE mezz). I'll have to play with that a bit to see what works for me.<br>
<br>
I did discover an interesting way to level in DL although I'm sure many of you have used this over the years. I found myself without a group and only a guild ranger nearby. We hooked up and did some fear kiting (ranger snare, enchanter fear) and did 49 to 50 in about 6 hours. Only downtime was for a mana break every hour or so. The new 49 pet is better than its predecessors, and I would even try to get hit once just to get the pet helping out on the melee. Thanks again for all the help. <p>Caeelyena-50th High Elf Enchanter <BR>

if there isnt a healer in the group, i make sure that the group knows my concerns and then theyre pretty quick to help me out if mez fails or breaks.<br>

I Dazzle the normal oozes, I GoK the Swirling Oozes and Pools and I use Rapture for the first mez on a bad pull.  Now if you try to use dazzle on a Swirling Ooze or a Pool, it will almost always fail.  So I mez it with GoK and then tash, slow and possibly memblur if there is more than one mez'd mob.  When mez breaks I can re-mez with Dazzle getting more efficient use of my mana and longer duration mez. <p>--<a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=134141">Tanzia</a><BR>

If you were to tash right away and then slow, you would gain agro immediately.  But by slowing first, you can significantly lower the amount of damage the tank takes.  Then, you can let him/her build more agro before you tash and still have plenty of time before the other casters start nuking. <p>--<a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=134141">Tanzia</a><BR>

I will tash after something is mezzed so that all the debuffs will land before I use one of the mem blur line spells *usually reoccurring amnesia*  I agree that switching mobs is a bad bad bad idea the only time I will yell out switch is if someone has dotted the one I am trying to mez by mistake.  I don't even have root memmed 75 percent of the time but that is mainly because I am always with the same cleric and she keeps it memmed in case I get in trouble that I can't get out of *for some reason the Rock Golems in The Hole really really like me*<br>
<br>
AeO Mez I don't even bother memming unless in a situation where I know we are going to get bunches of adds I tend to think that letting the tanks get hit a couple more times while I get off single mezzes is easier and has proven to get me hit less.  If mez fails and I get hit on I just stand and stun/mez rinse and repeat if necessary luckily I have a cleric in our group that is great at keeping me alive! If only there was enough spell gems for all the spells we would like to have memmed at one time (wishful thinking)<br>
<br>
I say bring on the multiple adds gives us something to do besides handing out candy giggles<br>

    - Mezz before tash, Agro from tash is just plane old silly<br>
    - Slow before tash, if resisted wait a second and tash, as someone said slow mob = less damage = less downtime<br>
    - Stuns - User your Level 4 Stun, the resist rate is about the same and its a 1 sec cast time.  <br>
    - Root - If your MA has a hard time getting agro, Root is great.  Just make sure the MA knows to step into the mobs as root will cause agro to the closest player.<br>
    - Targeting mobs - To help target mobs that are being pulled use invis.  Invis up and go into the pull path slightly away from the party, when the MA goes past, mezz the back mob.  <br>
     - Running Around - Whoever said running around was a mistake is 100% WRONG.  Maybe moving around without control is, but if mezz is resisted and I am getting hit I will always move a bit.  One - This uses pathing to my benefit as it gives me more time to keep mobs mezzed.  Two - It places mobs in better position.  IE not stacked on the tanks.<br>

Running around like a chicken with its head cut off in circles spamming &quot;I'm getting hit&quot; just makes you look bad and in no way helps the situation.<br>
<br>
Carefully moving back from the mobs when you're being hit to help spread them out from a &quot;pack&quot; so that you can more easily target one over another is extremely helpful. (The one you've got mezed won't follow <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  - very useful when 2 or 3 are nearly perfectly stacked on top of one another, rare but annoying)<br>
<br>
Slowly moving away from a mob that the MT is trying to get agro off of you from, will let him build up the agro on the mob without the mob summoning you back -- which means you're more likely to ditch the agro quickly. <br>
<br>
It's all about moving with some planning and care. <p><p><center><embed src="http://luther.wordcrafters.org/images/lliesig.swf" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=120 quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130411" target="_blank"><br><i>What I'm wearing... </i></a></center>
