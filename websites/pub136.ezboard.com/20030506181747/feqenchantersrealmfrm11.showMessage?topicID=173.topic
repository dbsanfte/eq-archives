I switched to use colour line of spells and found that some mobs at LCY or RCY were immune to stun.  I guess that many mobs are immune to stun.  <br>
<br>
1. What is the good tactics using to those immune to stun and high resistance mobs, especially in PoD e.g. bugs (as I went to PoN and found that mobs were easier to mezzed at hedge)? <br>
2. Any good advice on the sequence of spells to cast when mezzing for Tier 1 and 2 Planes is highly appreciated.  <br>
3. In addition, I have about 242 CHA after buffed, still want to have more CHA equipment, any good suggestion?<br>

Well, welcome to the world of the chanter with 55+ Mobs.<br>
<br>
First, GoK, Rapture (level 59 - It is unresistable, I have mezzed Dark Reavers in CoM with it.) and Apathy (level 61) become your friends.  There is another mezz at level 64 (Bliss I think).<br>
<br>
Over time crowd control changes.  Slow becomes the primary damage mitigation tool.  Mezz gets trickier.  Its always good to try to mezz new mobs while you have 1 (for example some Giants in PoS are mezzable).  That way you can try mezz and root while your mates are beating on it.  FD pullers are more important and a mage with CoH really helps (CoH clears aggro).<br>
<br>
As for Firebone Casters, they are mezzable.  I can not recall if GoK can get them, but Rapture and Apathy can.  I have gotten a CoD flag from killing Grummus and I can not recall an unmezzable (non-named) mob along the way.  <br>
<br>
So how does one survive at level 60+?  Slow and Arcane Rune.  If a mob is slowed, I can take several hits in PoV (perhaps even re-rune).  There Apathy is the only mezz that works (and Rapture would be so useful too).<br>
<br>
So what to do if pulling unslowable mobs?  DoT/Tash is about the only useful thing we can do.  Those mobs need to go down fast, so anything that improves that damage output of the group is very handy.<br>
<br>
So, the competition for high level groups is Shaman.  Their slow and buffs are generally better than ours.  Chanters Haste is better and we can mezz many mobs even in higher planes.  Given the low DPS of each class (unless you are charming), it is rare that Chanters and Shaman group together.  Adds are very dangerous in Tier 2 planes as they hit hard and while mezzing one the other is unslowed.  2 unslowed Tier 2 mobs will take out most groups.<br>

<br>
Thanks for advice.  Now I am lvl 59 and soon be lvl 60 if I work a bit harder this week.  I think our Ae mezz only workable on PoJ and not the other planes, so we have to work out how to handle 2 or more adds.  I have always grouped with a shammy and they are helpful in slow and my main job is to haste, clarity and to single mezz sometimes.  If mezz for 2 more, unless the tank is pretty good otherwise will tell them to zone.  I may ask the puller to run around in PoN hedge, i pick up one then Gok, then the other one.  Tash and then use dazzle as have longer mezzing time.  Shammy can help in slow which I am controlling 2 mezzed mobs by single mezz (either GoK or Dazzle). I think I will get more xp to lvl 60 and AA points after 60.  May need advice on where to hunt after lvl 60 as I dont know anything about how to get flagged for other planes.<br>
<br>
However, still not think I can go even PoI as most mobs are unmezzable even with GoK (when I was lvl 58 been there, think it was the factory or ship??) Will get new lvl 59 spell and try again, may be.<br>

Pre GoK mezzes will not work on 56+ mobs.<br>
GoK works up to 57<br>
Rapture(59) works up to 61, and is unresistable (-1000 adjust)<br>
Apathy(61) up to 62, Sleep(63) up to 65 and Bliss(64) up to 67.<br>
GoK, Apathy, Sleep, Bliss all have -10 resist adjust and last 54 seconds.   Good technique is to first nail mob with Rapture, follow with Tash, and use a different mez after this, keeping Rapture available.<br>
<br>
None of our pre-60 stuns work on 56+ mobs.  This includes Color line, Largarn, and Nuke stun component.<br>
At 62, there is Word of Morrell, which is the ultimate Color series spell, and will stun all way up to 65.  Handy to interrupt Gates and CHs.<br>
<br>
Pacify will not work on 56+ mobs.<br>
Wake of Tranquility will work on mobs up to 60.  Good for splitting Guardians in PoD castle.<br>
Pacification(62) will pacify a 65 mob.  VERY useful spell.<br>
<br>
Do not forget alternatives to mez.  Fetter(5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  is an awesome spell.   It is your fastest root, and it is cheap.  Guardians of the Crypt in PoD castle are unmezzable.   But root one away from party, and it's as good as mezzed.  Greater Fetter(61) is even better, thanks to its -30 resist adjust.<br>
<br>
At 59, my CC line up in PoD used to be GoK/Rapture/Fetter/MemFlux/Wake of Tranquility/Tashanian.<br>
<br>
At 61, it is<br>
Apathy/Rapture/GFetter/MemFlux/WoT/HoT<br>

Couple of note to your spell list.<br>
<br>
First off, I think you missed 2 very important spells.  These are Boggle and Horrifying Visage.<br>
<br>
For anyone in the Planes, its quite common for Warrior MAs to have problems with Aggro Control.  Horrifying Visage helps that immeasurably.<br>
<br>
I use Boggle over Memflux all day long.  Casting Memflux has 3 issues: Its Uncertain, It wipes the whole aggro list, and it has a long cast and recast time.  Boggle has none of these issues.  Boggle is either resisted or not.  It takes you down on the hate list and is very very fast.<br>
<br>
Some mobs can not be lulled independent of level.  So I concur with your points on WoT and Pacification, but there are limits to there effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Rapture is overlooked as well by many chanters.  With it you can mezz anything that is mezzable with that spell, including Dark Reavers in CoM.  However, its generally ineffective in Tier 2 zones.<br>

<br>
BUT, here's a scenario I'm seeing more and more in the upper planes:  Group consists of Cleric, Chanter, and 4 dmg. dealers.  I'm on slows when there's no shammy present, so guess who's getting aggro?  Toss HV on the MT first, then hit your slow, and you can often go unnoticed by Mr. Ugly.<br>
<br>
If he DOES aggro you, Boggle casts in about 1/3rd or 1/4th the time blur does, and since all you did was bump yourself down his hate list (instead of wiping his list competely), all the aggro your MT worked so hard rises to the surface.<br>
<br>
Horryfying Visage &amp; Boggle really do make a fine pair. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On mezzes though, I wanted to note that Rapture is not, in fact, unresistable.  It's a great spell, but as soon as you get your first flag, you'll start seeing it get resisted...a lot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Apathy will become your new best friend as you wave goodbye to Dazzle (one of the very best mezzes ever designed IMHO).

It just so happens that MTs I usually work with are SKs and Pallies - and these guys usually have a death grip on aggro.
