New AAXP overview<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=84833&start=0">forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/...33&start=0</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>General</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(Requires Level 51)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innate (Statistic)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Statistics all have plateau levels and soft caps where there are diminishing returns over certain values. Usually these levels are easily reached with modern day gear. They are still nice, but most people place them at low priority unless you are specifically deficient in one or enjoy having 'my stat is bigger than your stat' contests with your friends. There are a few areas like tradeskills where the cap does not come into play. But even then, you are probably better off raising your max statt, then using spells and banked high statistic gear. (5 Levels) Cost: 1/1/1/1/1. Benefit: Raises statistic 2 points per skill level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innate (Resistance)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Like innate statistics these are low priority because of the limited benefit. Though these are higher priority on the PVP servers. (5 Levels) Cost: 1/1/1/1/1. Benefit: Raises resistance 2 points per skill level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innate Run Speed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: A permanent 30% boost to your run speed is just a good thing, even though it doesn't stack with other run speed modifiers. Old CW: Run Speed is the best skill you can buy. New CW: Run Speed is the best skill you can buy. (3 Levels) Cost: 1/1/1. Benefit: Raises run speed 10% per skill level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innate Metabolism</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Reduces your food and drink consumption to half at the highest level. This skill is merely a convenience. How important this convenience is to you is determined by how annoyed you are at having to go buy, beg, or summon food. Old CW: Spending aaxp on food? New CW: My horse Black Booty refuses to eat anything but Misty Thicket Picnics (3 Levels) Cost: 1/1/1. Benefit: Reduces food and drink consumption by 10%, 25%, and 50%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innate Lung Capacity</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: You wouldn't want to play without an EB item or spell on unless you were just passing through an airless space anyway. And, with the new LoY spell Leviathan Eyes or our other enduring breath spells, there is little to no reason for an enchanter to bother with this. (3 Levels) Cost: 1/1/1. Benefit: Increases the amount of air you have by 10%, 25%, and 50%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First Aid</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: With a tinkered band aid machine, you could almost make a case for this skill. Particularly if you solo a lot or are in other groups without any kind of healer. This would still be extremely low priority for most people. Soloers are probably better off getting their hands on regeneration effect items. (3 Levels) Cost: 1/1/1. Benefit: Raises the maximum amount you can bind wound by 10% per level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innate Regeneration</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: While one point of regeneration per level may not seem like a lot it adds up. At its top level that's 30 extra hp a minute. With an enchanter's relatively low hp pool, this makes a big difference to recovery time if you don't have a healer around. And, since our shielding line doesn't add hp when cast, we always need to top off life after casting. It's cheap and you need to spend 6 points to get to archetype anyway. (3 Levels) Cost: 1/1/1. Benefit: 1 point of regeneration per skill level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>New Taanan Crafting Mastery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Each level allows you to raise an additional tradeskill beyond the 200 cap to 250. The old way of thinking was to simply use a different character to do the other tradeskills. But with the benefits of high statistics, no drop components, tradeskill mod gear, and cross discipline items it's probably more desirable now to do them all on one character. Tradeskillers are a little nutty anyway so 3 points probably is a small price to pay. This applies the tradeskill beyond the first of Jewelcraft, Pottery, Smithing, Tailoring, Baking, Brewing, and Fletching. (6 Levels) Cost: 3/3/3/3/3/3. Benefit: One additional tradeskill can be raised beyond the 200 cap per level of this skill.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(Requires Level 55, and at least 6 points in General Abilities)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spell Casting Mastery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: This was often debated to be either the number one or number two archetype skill, and got a big boost with PoP because of a lot of new high cost combat spells. Unfortunately you still need the full amount of mana for the spell, and then it just doesn't use all of it. Old CW: Enchanters don't use much mana anyway, think about Subtlety instead. New CW: I'll have a Spell Casting Mastery, a side order of fries, and a Coke. (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Improves the chance of a specialization check by 5%, 15%, and 30%. In practical terms this reduces fizzle rates by an unknown amount, and mana used by spells by 3%, 6%, and 12%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spell Casting Subtlety</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Getting hit not at all is better than getting hit. Enchanters have a lot of high aggro spells and not a lot of hp/AC to cope with it. This is widely accepted in the top two of our archetype skills. Old CW: Is this thing on? New CW: Aha it wasn't on, this is great! (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Spell aggro reduced by 5%, 10%, and 20%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spell Casting Reinforcement</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Prerequisite for Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Lengthens the duration of buffs cast by you including from items like the enchanter epic, and tranquility pants. Your friends will love long duration KEI when you run by them. Nice on raids particularly for hastes which are often a bit too short for some long fights when you factor in buff time. Side benefit of improving the effective mana efficiency of buffs. (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Increases buff duration by 5%, 15%, and 30%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spell Casting Fury</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Prerequisite for Fury of Magic]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Adds the ability to critical hit with direct damage spells. This is not the forte of an enchanter, but with PoP spell Insanity we aren't just wasting our time now. Value of this skill varies a lot based on the playstyle of the character. Old CW: Sweet! Now I can *not* land on the mob for 1350! New CW: Kabooom! (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Increases chance to score a critical hit with a nuke by 2%, 4%, and 7%. Also, raises the maximum damage of that critical by 33%, 66%, and 100%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Channeling Focus</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Improves the ability to channel through hits which an enchanter is often subjected to. It's still nice, but there are new options now that probably have priority. Old CW: My mother went to Sebilis for an AE group, and all I got was this crummy T shirt. New CW: What is this AE of which you speak? (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Reduces your interrupts by 5%, 10%, and 15%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spell Casting Expertise</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Prerequisite for Mastery of the Past]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Makes it impossible to fizzle spells below certain levels. Unfortunately, the level of the vast majority of the spells I use are above the cap of even Mastery of the Past. So you have to choose whether you think it's more important not to fizzle, or use less effective (though cheaper) spells. This skill was effectively downgraded with PoP because there is a bigger impact for not using the higher level spells now. Note: If you consider purchasing level one for gate, realize that gate won't fizzle but it will still collapse. Grar #$%@^! (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Makes it impossible to fizzle a spell below level 20, 35, and 52.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spell Casting Deftness</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Arguably the worst skill an enchanter has. We simply don't have the spells to justify the expense. It only adds to beneficial spells over four seconds, and it doesn't stack with Quick Buff. Our beneficial spells that aren't buffs the ones you are going to care about are gate and... uh... gate. Okay so maybe blanket of forgetfulness. Save your 12 points and put it toward Quick Buff instead. (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Reduces cast times of beneficial spells over 4 seconds by 5%, 15%, and 25%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mental Clarity</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Prerequisite for Gather Mana]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Level one is still an incredible aaxp bargain. Levels two and three are questionable until you are working toward Gather Mana. It did, however, receive a boost in PoP because we are actually burning through mana again. Note: Mental Clarity has no effect on the 15 Flowing Thought cap. Old CW: Wow mana regen for aaxp! New CW: Mental Clarity is insignificant compared to the power of the Dark Si... errr... Spell Casting Mastery. (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Increases mana regeneration by 1 per ability level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Natural Durability</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Every time I've ever died in this game I've done so because I didn't have enough hit points. Many enchanters will opt for the skills that will keep you from getting hit in the first place. (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Increases max hitpoints by 2%, 5%, and 10% of your base max hp. Base hp here refers to your natural hp modified by gear but does not include direct hp buffs (though stam buffs should be impacted.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Combat Stability</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Prerequisite for Innate Defense]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Enchanters damage mitigation is not what one would call phenomenal even with this skill. (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Increases melee damage mitigation by 2%, 5%, and 10%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Combat Agility</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Prerequisite for Lightning Reflexes]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Avoiding getting hit is the goal when getting attacked for an enchanter. This skill is somewhat helpful, but the big payoff from this skill is Lightning Reflexes. (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Increases melee damage avoidance by 2%, 5%, and 10%.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Class</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(Requires Level 59, and at least 12 points in Archetype Abilities)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mass Group Buff</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: This is a great skill for raids but lacks the utility for single groups for an enchanter. If I had it to do over again I'd go the Gather Mana route first as an enchanter. You typically end up doing additional castings to cover people that missed the area buff anyway. Old CW: Gather round for MGB! New CW: I can just use the raid window for buffing and buy some skills that help me all the time. (1 Level) Cost: 9. Benefit: Hit's everyone in a radius with the next beneficial buff you cast.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dire Charm</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Probably the most downgraded ability in PoP with Command of Druzzil around. It is still wonderful for fairly safe, reliable damage. And, it super duper for farming keys or tradeskill supplies. Many of the PoP zones have mobs that appear to be placed there for the specific purpose of Dire Charm. Though because you can't summon a Dire Charmed mob it often difficult to get your dire charmed pet where you need it. Link death is also a problem with the long refresh rate of the skill and possible difficulty of grabbing a new pet. Old CW: Mages whine, &quot;Dire Charm is broken.&quot; New CW: Mages whine, &quot;CoD is broken.&quot; Near Future CW?: Dire Charm it is then. (1 Level) Cost: 9. Benefit: Permanently charm a charmable level 46 or below NPC. (refresh time 72 minutes)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Quick Buff</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: By far the skill with the biggest boost in PoP for the enchanter, and this solely because of Arcane Rune. It's a lot easier to chain cast Arcane Rune at 2.5 seconds than 5 seconds when a mob is beating on you. And, it's surprising how long you can sometimes live against a slowed mob. I'm still not advocating that this is an A list skill but it went from very weak to very strong. Note: This isn't a big selling point but surprisingly this affects our lull line including pacification because they are marked as beneficial. Old CW: Why do I really care if KEI takes 6 or 12 seconds? New CW: Tank Mezzing %t! (3 Levels) Cost: 3/6/9. Benefit: Reduces casting time of beneficial spells that have duration by 10%, 25%, and 50%<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Permanent Illusion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Prerequisite for Project Illusion]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: This is the skill that is most often bought for giggles and used for major utility. With a druid's wolf form this skill is fantastic. Other applications can be permanent boon of the garou for yourself or air elemental/imp for levitation. Note about levitation illusions: the levitation component does not appear to carry over through zone lines anymore. I have personally tested this in PoP and Luclin at least. This skill will without a doubt at some point get you killed when you zone into some place they don't like your illusion though. Old CW: Yay I'm always a kitty now! New CW: Forget Cats, Dogs Rule! (1 Level) Cost: 3. Benefit: Retain the current beneficial illusion and all of it's abilities until you die or click it off.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jewelcraft Mastery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: For you tradeskillers out there, this one is for you. It makes the PoP jewelry succeed a lot more often. I can personally attest that level 3 of this skill has saved me hundreds of thousands of plat, making primarily bloodmetal earrings of engagement. Old CW: JC Mastery WTF! New CW: KAching! Near Future CW: PoP jewelry was so five minutes ago. (3 Levels) Cost: 3/6/9. Benefit: Reduces your chance of failing a jewelry combine by 10%, 25%, and 50%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Gather Mana</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires Mental Clarity 3, Prerequisite for Hastened Gathering]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Another of our A list abilities. Considering that we actually use mana again, and Mental Clarity is less of just a path to get here, it effectively got a boost with PoP. This is a very flexible skill that has a multitude of uses. It's great for a recovery from a wipeout, for the &quot;Oh darn I really need mana&quot; moments, drawn out boss mob fights, or even just filling your mana bar at the end of a night. Perhaps its biggest benefit is letting you run closer to the edge because you have a Get Out of Jail Free card. Old CW: MGB 4 life yo! New CW: It's expensive but MC3 is pretty darn useful too. (1 Level) Cost: 5. Benefit: Recover up to 5000 mana (refresh time 144 minutes)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires Spell Casting Reinforcement 3]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: 120 Minute VoQ, and 1 hour haste is a good thing. Note: I've now tested this out myself, this plus a 8th shawl takes you to +70% duration. Old CW: Why would anyone need an enchanter, KEI lasts 150 minutes? New CW: Why would anyone need an enchanter, your KEI lasts 255 minutes? (1 Level) Cost: 8. Benefit: Increases the duration of beneficial buffs by 20% (with pre-reqs total of 50%)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PoP Advancement</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> (See individual skills)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Advanced Innate (Statistic) and wacky named resists</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 61, 62, 63, 64 &amp; 65 plus General Ability of the same type]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Same as the General skill counterparts. Can train 2 per level starting at level 61. Just more of a semi-good thing. (10 Levels) Cost: 1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1. Benefit: Raises ability/resistance by 2 per skill level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innate Enlightenment</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>[Requires level 61, 62, 63, 64 &amp; 65]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Raises stat caps for intelligence and wisdom by 10 per level. Can train 1 per level starting at level 61. (5 Levels) Cost: 3/3/3/3/3. Benefit: Raises Int and Wis caps by 10 per skill level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Planar Power</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 61, 62, 63, 64 &amp; 65]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Raises all statistics caps by 5 per skill level. It may be surprising, but because planar power is cheaper per skill level you don't lag that far behind innate enlightenment for getting your int raised. 9 points of innate enlightenment gets you 30 points of extra int cap. 10 points of planar power gets you 25 points of int plus all the other stats. If you are close to the cap buffed on other stats, you may consider doing planar power before enlightenment. (5 Levels) Cost: 2/2/2/2/2. Benefit: Raises all ability caps by 5 per skill level.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PoP Ability</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mastery of the Past</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 62, 63, and 64 plus Spell Casting Expertise 3]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: About the only spells I regularly use that would be affected by this skill are forlorn deeds and scryer's trespass. No fizzle on slow would be fantastic, but the 21 points required to get any use out of it have pushed it way, way down the list. (3 Levels) Cost: 3/3/3. Benefit: Makes it impossible to fizzle spells below levels 54, 56, and 58.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innate Defense</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 61, 62, 63, 64 &amp; 65 plus Combat Stability 3]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: This is a nice skill, but with the pre-requisite takes 27 points to max. You are definitely better off going with Lightning Reflexes first, and then it's a tossup between this skill, channeling focus, and natural durability. For 24 points you can get both CF and ND, so pick your poison. Old CW: Owwww! New CW: Owww! (with only 3 W's) (5 Levels) Cost: 3/3/3/3/3. Benefit: Further increases melee damage mitigation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Lightning Reflexes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 61, 62, 63, 64, &amp; 65 plus Combat Agility 3]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: This skill is great and post nerf, possibly supplanting Total Domination as the number two PoP ability. Avoiding getting hit is better than having to channel through it or mitigate the damage for an enchanter. Old CW: Wow that's expensive, I wonder how well it works. New CW: Can you hit me now? Good. Can you hit me now? Good! (5 Levels) Cost: 3/3/3/3/3. Benefit: Further increases chance to avoid getting hit by melee.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hastened Gathering</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 63, 64, 65 plus Gather Mana]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: If you like gather mana (and who doesn't,) you'll appreciate the faster rate. Level 3 brings Gather down to a manageable 100 minutes. (3 Levels) Cost: 2/2/2. Benefit: Reduces gather mana time by 10% (14.4 minutes) per skill level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Eldritch Rune </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>[Requires level 61, 63, 65]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Without a doubt this is an A list ability. It is instant cast and can be done on the run (though occasionally it fails but you can hit it again.) Often it is fine as your main rune. But it works best after your arcane rune (or older eldritch) has been beat down. That's 3000 bonus hp you have at your disposal. It does not stack with Arcane Rune, but either will overwrite the other and you'll get a fresh 1500 points. Not to mention, if you aren't getting hit frequently, it's a huge mana savings. Arcane Rune aint cheap. Old CW: Sounds great but it doesn't stack and it's only every 10 minutes. New CW: 9 points of aaxp is better than searching for my teeth. (3 Levels) Cost: 3/3/3. Benefit: Instant cast 500, 1000, and 1500 point self rune. Duration: 36 Minutes (Refresh 10 minutes)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Suspended Minion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 62 &amp; 64]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Having a pet in reserve can be a nice. It's nice for land mining when you need to run away. Though our summoned pet is too prissy to really worry about this skill. Also usable as a mana reserve during those ultralong ubermob fights with reclaim energy. I'm told your pet sends you a tell when you fold it up and set it free. Almost worth the entertainment value. (2 Levels) Cost: 5/3. Benefit: First level suspends a pet at its current health, second level suspends pet with all buffs, weapons, and armor.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Animation Empathy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 61, 63 &amp; 65]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: It's fairly expensive relative to the power of our pets. But it is nice to be able to guard your pet so you can summon companion, tell it to attack without getting whacked, and tell it to back off. Old CW: I like our pet but I wish we had all the pet commands New CW: My charmed pet obeys my every command... well except when it's trying to remove my esophagus through my belly button. (3 Levels) Cost: 4/3/2. Benefit: First level gives you &quot;/pet guard here&quot; and &quot;/pet follow me&quot;. Second level gives you &quot;/pet attack.&quot; And third level gives you &quot;/pet back off&quot; and &quot;/pet taunt off&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fury of Magic</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 61 plus Spell Casting Fury 3]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: This ability simply increases the frequency that you nuke for critical damage. It doesn't make you nuke for more. If you liked Spell Casting Fury, you'll love Fury of Magic. And, now it's minty fresh. (3 Levels) Cost: 3/6/9. Benefit: Increases the frequency but not the power of your critical hits.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Project Illusion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 62 plus Permanent Illusion]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: You will learn to hate this skill. Despite the utility and entertainment value of being able to illusion other people, they will want to be in their preferred illusion ALL THE TIME. Despite the nuisance, you probably still want this just for gnome illusion (aka enchanter shrink.) Not to mention that some of our other illusions have benefits that stack nicely with other spells (fire elemental, werewolf, etc.) Old CW: She turned me into a newt! ...I got better. New CW: Shutup before I turn you into a torch! (1 Level) Cost: 4. Benefit: Allows you to cast your next illusion onto targetted group member.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Total Domination</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> [Requires level 61]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Charm indeed got a big ol' whack by the nerf bat. It is still useful, but no where near as stable as it was pre-nerf. One of the developers claimed that Total Domination would be more useful now than ever... But, how can you believe someone who just gave you a beating and now wants to kiss and make up? The jury is very much still out on the value of Total Domination and charm in general. I personally solo about half as fast as I did before due to the exp, and increased danger. Though I have to admit, half of a whole lot is still a lot. Many enchanters will move this off the A list, the more emotional of them move it way down the priority scale. Old CW: With CoD and TD3 I am a levelling god! New CW: Please don't hit me in the groin with that nerf bat! (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Makes charm victims less likely to break charm.<br>
