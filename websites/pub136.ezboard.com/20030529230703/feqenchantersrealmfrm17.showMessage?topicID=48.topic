Currently the situation with Ragefire and his spawn rate is something that causes too much contention in this game.  We play a game that is designed to make us interact and work with each other.  With the reduction of ragefire pops there has become an increasingly hostile environment for clerics who wish to complete their epic.  Guilds themselves have become a part of the fight for ragefire and it is causing friends to contest each other and in the end leaves everyone involved with a bad taste in their mouth.  We each pay Verant money so that we can sit down and play a game. When we log off the game it should only be with a feeling of happiness and with memories of good times.  The ragefire spawn though leaves one to log off feeling bitter, disgusted and completly frustrated with the game.  Because of this I want to try to fix the situation.  I am asking that all players send an email to the following addresses to let verant know that we are not happy with the ending of the cleric epic.  <br>
<br>

  If you want you can just copy and paste the following to your email.<br>
<br>
  I am a player of Everquest.  I am asking the designers at Verant to please come up with a better solution for the ending of the cleric epic.  The current spawn rate and accessibilty of Ragefire causes contention and fights among people that normaly are friends.  It is my belief that the spirit of the game is something that wants us to work together and to interact with others.  Ragefire as he now is designed almost forces players to go against each other and leads to bitter feelings for everyone.  Please consider the situation as it now stands and look for a solution that will not pit friends against friends.  Thank you for your time and have a good day.<br>

  I do not know if Verant will listen to us or not, but I do know that I feel we must try to do something.  The way things are now with Ragefire simply stink.  More then one person I know says the camp is painful and wish something would be done about it.  Well now is the time for us to try to do something about it.  This message is being posted on as many boards as I can find that are related to Everquest.  Let your friends know and have them send Verant an email.  If nothing else is done atleast we will have voiced our opinons and have tried to fix the problem as best we can.  Thank you all for your time and may you have good hunting and safe journies.   <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

Now that VI has made rage very very very doable for any cleric, why not at least make the enchanter epic attainable by enchys that are NOT in uberguild_01? <p><IMG SRC="http://www.tunareguildalliance.org/guilds/is_logo.jpg">

<br>
Did it with Guild explicit withing 1 hour of the patch on Sept 4th, 2002<br>
<br>
Kk this is healot from the ammount of tells yesterday i guess there was manying people wanting u know more about the &quot;new&quot; triggerd rage fire, i'll start at <br>
<br>
-Hail the new warder in from of the statue <br>
-If you are the first one to hail her after she has spawned she &quot;should&quot; give u a box and tell u to get 4 shards, im not sure if u need to be 60 or not but it seems u also need the swirling pearl meaning all other peices of the quest done <br>
-she gives you box and tells u that there are 4 shards scatter threw out the SF mounts. <br>
-shards are called pearlscent shards or somthing they look like pearls there no drop and the seem to drop MAINLY off all DRAKES(skyfire/shadow ect) <br>
-gather 4 shards, took me like 60mins but that was with 15 people pulling 15mobs at a time so this could take some time, but really i think if u could pull drakes everytime then u could get them easy. <br>
-put 4 shards in the box, press combine <br>
-give the box to the warder who then gives you a seal of zordak rage fire (or somthing) and spawns the human version of zordak <br>
-kill the human version of zordak he's very easy once he dies rage fire the dragon spwans right on top of him <br>
-no change has been made there still as easy as they always were, kill the dragon lewt the imperfect or impure heart or what ever <br>
-then take the seal or zordak rage fire the swirling peral and combine them in the heart....................... you now have zordak rage fires hearrt <br>
-go to TD to the island witch i do not have the loc of and shouldnt need to give a cleric cuz we go there like 4time, <br>
-give heart to omat vasata(erudite dood), he gives you the last orb of what ever, then despawns. <br>
-run to the beach near the hut where some other erudite dood has spawned and give him the 3 orb's (vapor,water,ice), he gives u the orb of the tribbunel <br>
-then wait for the avatar of water to spawn takes bouat 30secs-60sec for him to come so dont worry, run up to him hand in and WOOOT epic epic <br>
<br>
<br>
k for any thing that wenrt clear post them here try to reframe from asking in game, theres prolly already betteer sites but i told people i would post so i did, gl with it guys finally they fixed it. <br>
<br>
<br>
Healot the Only Cleric<br>
