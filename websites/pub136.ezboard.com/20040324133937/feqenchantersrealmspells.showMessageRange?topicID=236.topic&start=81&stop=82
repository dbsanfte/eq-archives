<br>
  As soon as I hit 62 I went to bazaar to price my upcoming lvl63 spells only to be knocked on my ass by the sudden massive price increase.KEI went down to 5-7k finally as of October '03.Then when the Platinum dupe hit it skyrocketed back up to over 16k - this happened in less than a week.<br>
<br>
VoQ went from 20k to 80k.HoV from 30k to well over 100k.Spells werent the only item hit and yes I do have sympathy for the tanks who were saving for the Scepter of Destruction which went from 80k to almost 500k in 3 days.<br>
<br>
Who is the real criminal here though?The sellers who saw they CAN sell those items for that price because people had the pp for it courtesy of E-Bay/PA? The buyers for screwing the economy up by illegally purchasing PP with real money out of game to buy the things they are too lazy to go get in game?Or perhaps SOE for not finding better ways to clamp down on the Plat sellers and buyers who are screwing up the honest people in EQ ?<br>
<br>
 My suggestion in my first post was not made primarily as a joke,my suggestion of a strike within EQ.If all casters whom were constantly placed in a position to cast beneficial spells upon others,suddenly and without warning stopped casting,EQ would almost certainly come to a stop.Almost meaning of course these very same people would be expected to buff people in thier own guilds,but no-one else beyond that.<br>
<br>
Lower level toons would be without Temp,C1,etc.Leveling becomes harder and much slower.Higher level toons would be more affected without of course KEI,HoV,Fo7,etc.<br>
<br>
Think how in demand clerics would be if none would join up in LDoN pick-up groups.How in demand chanters would become for that pre-adventure KEI and SoV.How in demend Shamans would be to slow mobs and buff groups.<br>
<br>
My point is one person doing this is like a sparrow all alone in the forest singing - no one hears the one little sparrow singing or they tend to ignore it.However,when that one little sparrow is joined by 3-4-10 thousand more sparrows,then they get noticed and quickly.<br>
<br>
Casters going on a form of strike in EQ would gain not only the attention of the players who need those buffs to survive or make thier game-play easy,it would gain the attention of SOE as well and they might finally hear our plea to make high level spells available on vendors.Would you rather consider going to E-Bay or Player Auction like so many others,just to purchase 250kpp with even MORE money than you are currently paying per month,or would you rather have the option of paying 2-3-4k for the spell off a vendor?<br>
<br>
The simplicity behind this is amazing if anyone in thier right mind stopped for a moment to think about it.And the reaction on SOE's part would I imagine be swift in meeting the demands of they casters who buff others to make thier gameplay easier.<br>
<br>
Of course you will have several who will rant and rave and claim they are going to start thier own chanters,shamans,and clerics just to foil the plans of the people striking,BUT,where will these people get the money to outfit new toons?Where will they get the buffs needed to keep these new toons alive to reach the levels needed for KEI,HoV,and Fo7?Believe me thier journey to uberness will be long and difficult and the people striking will get what they asked for long before these toons reach 60+.<br>
<br>
The answer is simple,go to Sony Online and start sending requests that higher level spells be made available on vendors,even if those vendors are placed in remote,out of the way places and they spell cost was made affordable but high for the honest people who play this game.Not to leave out the melee and hybrids,thier equipment (or at least some equipment) should be made available as well.<br>
<br>
If not on sale from vendors,my opinion is spells that are 60+ might be made no-drop or quested.This would solve the problems of the lvl 65 warrior wearing 500k of gear winning a roll on a spell Rune,when there might be a chanter in that very group who needs it for his lvl 65 spells.<br>
<br>
Take 5-10 minutes after reading this post and write to SOE voicing your concerns over the high prices,and the inability on the part of honest players to continue leveling because of the E-Bayed/PA platinum making its way into the game.Sony Online Entertainment despite the feelings of many does concern itself with the people who play thier games.If the players are unhappy and they threaten to quit,SOE stands the chance of losing a lot of money.It worked for the warriors who banded together over the aggro problems they have,and SOE was swift to act in order to keep these people from in-game-striking.When one person threatens to quit,SOE is losing only $13 a month.But when 10,000 threaten to quit,IT HURTS THIER WALLETS.<br>
<br>
Of the 450,000 EQ players,I know for certain there are at LEAST 10,000 who have casters.SOE will not take the chance of losing $130,000+ a month. <p>Glaeken Rasilom<br>

I , like the author, choose to have integrity and honor, and not exploit my fellow players. I &quot;pay it forward&quot;<br>
by assisting the new and giving away my hand me downs and lesser tradeskill items ( i have probably supplied a tenth of my server with acrylia studded masks from leveling my druid tailor)<br>
   I think alot of people forget that this is not REAL money. The generosity i have shown people has always come back threefold, and if they try to take advantage of my kindness by being a pest, thats what the ignore window is used for.<br>
   Eq players are gifted with certain unalienable rights, including the right to be evil and selfish.... Same as RL. <br>
And like free speech, i can passionately hate what someone says (or in this case does) , but will do all in my power to protect their right to be a jerque-auph. The easiest way to combat the trend towards greed is to form guilds with people of integrity, and alliances between like guilds, so that the righteous gain power over those who try to exploit others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showMessageRange?topicID=236.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showMessageRange?topicID=236.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showMessageRange?topicID=236.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showMessageRange?topicID=236.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showNextMessage?topicID=236.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=82><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.threadControl?topicID=236.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=236.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=236.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub136.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm11">General<option value="eqenchantersrealmadminnotices">Admin Notices<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm12">Equipment<option value="eqenchantersrealmspells">Spells<option value="eqenchantersrealmfaqs">FAQs<option value="eqenchantersrealmstories">Stories<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm7">Quests<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm9">Tradeskills<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm13">Auctions<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm14">Weapons & Armor<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm15">Profiles<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm8">Off Topic/Other<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm16">Everything But EQ<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm17">Old Stuff</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm>Eq Enchanters Realm</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells>Spells</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/eqenchantersrealm/">Eq Enchanters Realm Main Page</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31c<br>Copyright ©1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
