<br>
Since the last patch, all mezzes cast by same-level-enchanters/bards overwrite one another.<br>
<br>
Yes, let me say that again, all mezzes overwrite one another.<br>
<br>
So, you can plug down a difficult situation with a quick-mez (ae-mez or low-resist) then tash and switch to something which may have a higher resist rate, but which lasts longer or is more mana efficient (ie., GoK over rapture, or Dazzle over GoK, etc.)<br>
<br>
No more waiting for AE mez to wear off to get single target mezzes out!!<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd share that in case there are some who haven't picked up on the great improvement there.<br>
<br>
The one negative thing I have noticed, and its more of a &quot;requires more coordination now&quot; issue, is that if you're on a raid, and have multiple enchanters doing CC  -- you won't bounce mezzes anymore. In the past, we'd have one who cast GoK and one who cast dazzle etc. so that we didn't both waste mana mezzing the same mob. Now we overwrite heh, so we have to be communicating a litte more or just waste the mana. When your mez is overwritten you get the &quot;Your dazzle spell has worn off&quot; message, which can be alarming if you're not the one that over-wrote your mez. <br>

That was the biggest drawback of that spell.<br>
<br>
I also lead with mez, but hey, why stop there.  When mezed, tash, then Root.  Root and mez stack, so I find that works awsome - when mez breaks, it's still rooted, and the other way around.  While mezed i will debuff etc.<br>
<br>
If first mez fails, the stun, remez is the best reaction.  If that fails, you really are now dependent on your group and ac.  I find the shammy or druid should be on your side, and just thro that root when you yell, and all will be well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/usildiil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sildiil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#330000>(9/24/02 4:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mezzing add tactics</span><hr size=1> Something that works for me now is to have pet up.  The pet will taunt off the mob and hold its attention till i get it mezzed and unlike the the MT it knows when to stop hitting. I realize this hasn't always been the case. I made my enchanter after they changed things so pets wont break mez.  Is this something that is going to stop working for me as I level? I have to explain to group at times why I have pet and dont try to get it to engage in the fight unless there is just one mob.  Even with low hit points our pets have, they can take several hits till I can get mezz off and they taunt well if you haven't actually cast a nuke or something.    People have referred to our pet as nothing more than a DOT, but after the change on their breaking mezz they are also like rune without the gem.  What am I missing that no one else has mentioned this?<br>

<br>
You need to know the approx level of the mobs and if they resist magic/mez as low or high or always resist.<br>
<br>
The same tactic that worked for me on lower level frogs in OS, ended up getting me killed on the first pull of multiple (higher level) kobolds in Velks.  Hopefully you only have to fail badly once before you figure out how to modify your tactics.<br>
<br>
#2 Know the level of the mobs verses your level.  Maybe high level enchanters (especially 60th) talk about mezing as if its &quot;no problem&quot; or use phrases like &quot;any good enchanter can do it&quot;.  <br>
But the truth is that with high levels vs significantly lower level mobs, mezing is a LOT easier.  Resists are a level vs level formula and higher level ENC take less damage from hits based on a similar formula (not to mention having better items)<br>
<br>
Sorry -- I just gave away the secret of how 60th chanters manage to appear so amazing compared to the 50ths.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I thought the most dangerous time to play an enchanter was before you get the 49th Dazzle, and you're still wearing non-planar armor and items.  Also, like someone else said, healers just dont have enough experience keeping you alive.  When you are in your 50s (and 60) things should be hopefully easier.<br>
<br>
Until you know the above answers:<br>
<br>
- Dont buff the puller or anyone associated with healing or pulling, when mobs are incomming.<br>
- Don't cast Rune 4 or 5 during the first few seconds of fight<br>
- Don't be sitting on a pull, and dont sit during a fight unless you have to and there are other enchanters to protect you.<br>
- Don't AoE mez during the pull.  You might get a couple resists or out-agro the puller. <br>
<br>
- Don't mez anything until the main tank has attacked for a few seconds.  I beleive some of the hate generated by the main tank on his foe will transfer to the adds standing next to it (often in the same space) -- but I don't know for sure.  <br>
My concern is, if you mez too early and get a resist, you can pull 2 or more mobs to you, rather than just the resisting mob.  This has never happened to me after I wait a few seconds, letting the tanks spread thier hate.<br>
<br>
- Don't AE stun too early unless you have to for the same reasons you want to avoid AOE Mez resists, and chain agro.<br>
Also, several stuns DO generate enough agro that a tank may have trouble getting the mob off you.  <br>
<br>
This is a case of needing to know the taunting skill of the warrior and the hate-building qualities of the monster.<br>
<br>
After you know relative power of the mobs and their resists, you can modify the above suggested cautions and act more agressively to prevent incoming damage.<br>
<br>
One of the hardest lessons for a developing enchanter to learn is when: Too much Control effort = a very bad idea.<br>
<br>
If the group pwipes because you pulled agro then died before establishing control, then the wipe is your fault.  As tanks get more powerful (and players act smarter) they can actually survive a pack of adds long enough for you to be fairly careful with your Control. <br>
<br>
Once you are confident with the facts:<br>
<br>
- Keep 2 stuns ready, if you can, but sometimes other spells are needed to fill one slot.  Very very rarely will I have Zero AE stuns ready (vs giants and dragons, etc)<br>
<br>
- try to avoid meming Gate.  You will often die first, then the group will try to Evac to safety.  Get used to it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
- Resist using 1 slot as a permanent buff slot.  This is a spell slot that can be used to save the lives of yourself/group.  You should only have to do buff-ups every 20 minutes at worst.  Sit down, change out the least important control spell and ready/cast the buff.  Then sit and change it back.<br>
<br>
If you are on a raid with a few enchanters, you can probably be lazy with 1 buff slot.  But if you wipe-out, ask yourself: could you have made a difference if you had that extra AE stun, AoE mez, or Charm, or Rune III+, Theft of Thought, Mem Blur spell, rather than a buff slot?  Honestly, enchanters need about 14 spell slots, so why waste one?<br>
<br>
- Keep a Root ready.  If someone DoTs the wrong mob you want to mez, what are you going to do?  You could try Remove Magic on the mob to rid the Dot, but Ive never done this.  Charm works too, if you can risk it without causing a party wipe-out.<br>
Root is all around useful solution if you can position the mob away from the group or have the group move away from the mob.  Root also lets you escape an agro mob you just cant get away from.  At worst, it will just summon you (level 53+) back to take a hit every 10 seconds, then you run away again<br>
In a raid situation you can probably do without Root, but it never hurts.  People tell me I play a very good enchanter and often I think the difference is: I use Root plus Stuns when needed while many enchanters do not.<br>
<br>
- Wear a lot of HP items, always have HP and stamina buffs, even making yourself a pest by asking for them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I carry extra peridots to give the cleric so I always have the extra Symbol type spell.<br>
<br>
Think Ive written enough.  This is by no means a complete list of suggestions, and its no substitute for learning how to do it better than I do. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

They generate too much agro.<br>
<br>
And I had to laugh at the post above, because it's right on target about early agro. The fastest death I ever had was casting RuneV on a tank at what I thought was BEFORE he engaged Vindi, but apparently he'd just fired something off at him before it landed so boom, dead chanty. Stupid deaths annoy me, but I had to laugh at that one. If I'd known he was ready to engage I'd have skipped it, heh, he would certainly have survived, but our timetable got rushed and c'est la vie.<br>
<br>
The one buff I do almost always keep loaded during raids, is speed. Even epic'd there are too many people that perfer VoG and if I sit to med it mid-fight due to someone's haste dropping I'm going to draw agro and get pounded. This is less of an issue in exp-groups where I can time the recasts pro-actively and hit them between pulls.<br>
<br>
You *can* dispell dot spells with cancel magic or one of its kindred, but you run the risk of dispelling the slow or root or whatever is currently keeping the mob off your back when you do so. I have used this on several occasions though when the puller brought one in with a dot on it and the MA picked the add to tank. Easier to dispell and mez the original pull than try to shout for people to switch over. On those occasions I do generally get smacked a bit, so its not something I would recommend unless you have a very aware cleric or lots of hps/ac. <p><p><center><embed src="http://luther.wordcrafters.org/images/lliesig.swf" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=120 quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130411" target="_blank"><br><i>What I'm wearing... </i></a></center>
