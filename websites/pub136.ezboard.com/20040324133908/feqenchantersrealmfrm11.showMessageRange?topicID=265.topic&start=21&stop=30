The only thing I would have to say is that the tactics for pulling change drastically if you are doing Hard LDoN adv (granted for plane and time plus guilds it won't be much different). Lull pulling is a must unless the group want to die extremely quickly. Since the patch which thinned out some of the mobs chanters are a viable way to pull with lull, just make sure your cha is maxed, resists are deadly.  Best way i have found is to have the MT do your targetting and chanter standing back and out of line of sight for pacing, (wonderful thing about our 62 level spell).  At 42 seconds you can probably get 3 to 4 lulled and then have to pull.  IF you get a resist and agro make sure the tank does not attack the one you are on, as chances are you are only going to get 1 shot and getting it mezzed and you most likely will not have time to change targets for mezz. (990 a hit hurts even with 4-5k hp and AR up)<br>
<br>
Just a note on the harder stuff, although one thing about the hard ldon, i have gone with groups into these for the only purpose of XP and drops, at just over 2% aa a kill and the chance of extermely good drops,  i really could care less if i am on the leader board or not. :)<br>

<br>
2nd off, somewhere in the middle of your 50's people will start placing you on their DNG lists. The QUON is now a chanter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Snare and DoT lines are just a waste. Everyone knows their job and you dont have to tell everyone you are doing it. If your job is to snare (druid, ranger, SK) then just do it. If you DoT (Necro, Shammy, Druid) just do it. I mean what else would you be doing. Not having all the spam makes it easy to see when someone is really in trouble and needs help.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
One problem listed in here was someone stating that a problem arised when someone was Doting the mobs and it was breaking their mez. If this happens and noone is using a dot message then how do you know it is happening? You run around in group like a tard asking &quot; Is someone dotting? Is someone dotting? Is someone dotting?&quot; And as for snare? Damn skippy they better be using a snare message. As a chanter I want to know what is snared and when. If it ain't snared, I ain't playing games with it. When a Netherbian Ravager starts chasing your butt at SoW+ speed and quads your but for over 190 per shot, you quickly learn that you do not want to get aggro until someone slows it down to a crawl. Take your battle spam and stick it in another window. Keep you action spam in separate window too, but keep it up. If you don't know WHAT people are doing and when, then you are in for a bruising. <br>
<br>
Here is an example. You are grouped with a shammy. He is slowing due to his disease slow hits harder and easier. Your job is to tash and cripple, maybe have a charm pet handy. If the shammy isn't using a slow message and you are too far from the mob to see the &quot;%T yawns&quot; message, then how do you know if it is safe to tash/cripple/dot and get immediate aggro? You are currently fighting mobs that hit for MAX 70 to 80 per hit double shot. What are you going to do when you are in your 60's in BoT and are fighting mobs that quad for 900 a shot? My chanter is only 56 but I got 3 65's (monk, war, cleric) that DO play in BoT and let me tell you, even my cleric has trouble taking a 900 quad that hits for 2700. 1 quad, 6 seconds later, 2nd quad, dead cleric.<br>
<br>
Your advice for getting the group on the same page at the begginning is sound advice. If the group can't agree to assisting from the onset, then get out. But the rest of what you are saying is going to have you making a NON caster very soon.<br>

I don't have to run around asking is someone DoTing as it will be obvious the 2nd time Mez is broken.  Not to hard to figure out why Mez get broken if you watch your spell effects.<br>
<br>
I guess you are one who enjoys his little &quot;%t is mez, you break it you buy it&quot; lines.  Well if that is how you like to play then fine.  I just find it a pain when you see the same message 3 times in a row. That is when my poor monk thinks we have 3 adds and not just one because the chanter got 2 resist or it was broken due to a DoT.  What is more important to see is chanter saying %t will not mez, now that I want to see.  Some people I group with will put there snare and DoT lines in say and group.  Now that I like.  It helps to keep things seperate from one another.  Snare and DoT lines are just for peeps to feel important imo.<br>
<br>
You like the game played one way I like it another. Oh, I do have not casters and other casters.  The only lines I use are pull lines and some times heal lines but am moving away from that.<br>

<br>
He would DoT all the mobs that were brought to us and the way I could tell is I would mezz them all and they would have the message &quot;a %t has been woken up by Soandso&quot;...&quot;a %t has been woken up by Soandso&quot;...&quot;a %t has been woken up by Soandso&quot;...&quot;a %t has been woken up by Soandso.&quot;  They do that when they are DoTed.  So by the fiftieth time I was pulling my hair out, especially since he wasn't announcing it.  Plus not listening to me when I told him to please stop DoTing ALLLLLL the mobs.<br>
<br>
What can you actually do when someone does that and not crap on the rest of your group that is actually trying to win the adventure.  (Would NOT like to gate on them..just on the goofball DoTing...lol)<br>

That way, everyone is aware of what I'm on, but they don't read 3 times...&quot;mezzing %t...&quot; just because I got a resist or someone broke mez. I also have a hotkey for &quot;%t dotted, cannot be mezzed&quot; if one of the idiots is mass DoT'ing. That way the tank knows which mob to go after next. Mana and time permitting, I will root the dotted mob(s) so whoever it is hitting on can get out of range. <br>
<br>
Also, once I have everything under control, I remind the group to assist on the main mob and if they ignore me, I leave as soon as possible. I've never left an LDoN group, no matter how horrible they were, but I DO know who NOT to group with again.<br>

<br>
Kind of agree a bit with the above. As the enc you need to take charge of the group if it needs it. For those who have been around longer and remember Oasis Orc Highway, when groups would camp it and SG's were feared, there you'd spend many a group running back from EFp across NRo to loot your corpse. All because Enc_killer_03 thought DoTing or off tanking adds was the best way to go, along with half the group.<br>
<br>
If you as the enc didn't get them to get their @#%$ together you'd spend a night doing this run over and over. It only took me a night to figure out people underestimated mez. Now it's the other way round. You are expected to mez adds. If there are 5 mobs in the camp, why is the cleric getting hit? Mez it!<br>
<br>
You need to make your group aware of what you can/can't handle. If doing a hard adventure and you are also on slow you can't go through the dungeon like a steam train. Although they may try. If you need a med break, you say. Need mana hold 1 min.<br>
<br>
My style in dungeon crawling has changed slightly from my old OS/Guk days. Back then I would sit back and take what was pulled, whether just 2 or 6. Making use of mez/stun/mez combo with mana taps going. Now in LDoN I'm far more aggresive. I will pull, if I only have mana for singles I single pull (paci) making sure I have nearest possible add only a fast target toggle away. If I'm gtg for a few and Scryers Trespass (do this LoY spell quest if you haven't) has refreshed I'll pull 4 or 5. Pull by mezzing one, target toggle to the next and mez as inc. your 5 is now 3 and they only have 'you mezzed my mate' agro. Re-target before they hit camp and move behind the tank. The 'You're hitting my mate' agro beats your 'you mezzed my mate' agro and the MA takes an extra 3 on him, AE stun (Buy this spell from Ruj asap) Mez and Mez. By which time MA is on the next one. You're pull mez will drop around now, mez him when he hits camp etc... Try it. If you have amongst other things, the skill/aa's/gear/balls a whole new area (pulling) opens up to you.<br>
<br>
I often pull in PoEarth groups (mobs are slowed by the time they hit the camp). Sol Ro mini-boss raids I will pull most of the trash stuff if monks let me ;p I also often tag on raids too, tash is an ideal spell to pull agro on a rear inc and instantly make a 50/50 mob a much better cert for a 1st mez from either you (if time) or a fellow enc.<br>
<br>
I think the key word is control. If you're pulling you are in control of the encounter from beginning to end. And that is what an enchanters job is; To control the encounter.<br>
<br>
Oh, and always be prepared for some fantastic splats )))<br>

If you have a couple of tanks in your group, 1 a paladin, set up a button 'Charm Down' Block capitals, fancy visuals whatever. Impress upon your paladin how important it is that the pet gets stun locked the second charm breaks.<br>
<br>
So long as this is understood a charmed pet is fantastic for pulling. Pre-target two mobs and get them toggled. Send pet into room on one, and mez the 2nd onc immediately. Any others in the room will be on the pet, mez them off until pet fights only one. By the time you've done this the Tank figures out to hit the one on the pet and takes agro.<br>
<br>
LDoN charmable mobs have more HP than their uncharmable comrades. Make use of it. If doing a hard adventure beware, they will summon you if damaged using this tactic and charm breaks. Often this is also the time charm most likes to drop, but hell, more fun. Heal me chaps, this is gonna hurt!<br>

I generally prefer to pull in those sorts of groups but if there is an insistant sk or necro I simply make it quite clear that the ma is to assist them on inc because that mob will most often be dotted. It works well because you can ordinarily get all the adds mez on inc before snare/dotted mob comes in and can get it slowed off the bat. If your group has issues with following those simple directions then you always have color cloud and root to fall back on. Mixing up color cloud and word of morrel can save you in that situation and even though you would like to charm and speed a pet then gate on them dont, just grin and bear it and get through the adventure. And for the love of god NEVER group with them again. <br>
<br>
As for hard adv I pretty much stick with guildies only and those I know well. They as well are very fun with the right group. I do encourage any who have not tried an ae group in ldon, get one together that is probably the most fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   , well that or a two ench group both with pets that can take care of one another on breaks. <br>
<br>
I guess bottom line is that if you do pick up groups with no one you know then you are rolling the dice each time. If you group with someone who is retarded that you have grouped with before you have only yourself to blame. And lastly if you have a sillyhead dotting the mob the ma is not on boggle boggle boggle. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=niemam>NiemaM</A> at: 1/8/04 3:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rezumezu>RezuMezu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#330000>(2/5/04 10:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=265.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you handle various groups?</span><hr size=1> Couple o interesting tricks I have learned over the while.  As everyone has said communication is the key of course let them know what is going on and that you will or will not mezz.  If there are problems with mezz breaking people let everything come in the room and at the tank.  Stand directly behind the tank and just hit F8.  The mob that the MT is engaged with will be pushed back - ergo you get the mob that is not engaged.<br>
<br>
Color Line is huge for the lower level encounters.  If you have people switching targets alot or just dont know what they are doing and you are at a level that the color line still works just chain cast and boom, you have everthing mezzed even though they are attacking it, or its dotted.  (pray you dont get resisted though).<br>
<br>
Word of Morell is probably the most under appriciated spell there is atm.  A mezz breaks toss one of those out, its a seven second stun . . . . . . . you can cast any mezz, memblur or charm during that period. It also lets you see the who what and where that the meatshields are doing.<br>
