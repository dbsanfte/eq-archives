<br>
1) Recognition of the time to raise a class that is equipped to help others, and of the accomplishment of reaching the appropriate level and the played time involved.  In the case of a click-rez, this also applies to the accomplishment of attaining the epic.<br>
<br>
2) Recognition of the character's time and Mana.  Mana is &quot;free&quot;, but mana is also time.  And time is not free.  In the particular case of KEI, recognition of the fact that it costs 900 mana (yes, the enchanter gets the mana regen benefits from the same cast, but more on this later).<br>
<br>
3) In the case of KEI, recognition of the (sometimes) months spent saving (what used to be) 70k for a single spell scroll.<br>
<br>
4) In the case of KEI, recognition of the fact that KEI is almost like remote power-leveling.  At extremely low levels, it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> power-leveling.  It is four hours of reduced, even eliminated down time. (Even c1 eliminates downtime at level 4 from my experience)<br>
<br>
So, why a minimum charge?  Simply put, everyone wants KEI.  Ever just sit in Knowledge for a while?  Occasionally if no one has been shouting that they are casting KEI, you'll see a scrolling of requests for it.  Why does this make a difference?<br>
<br>
At my current level (56) I *might* have 2700 mana for three casts; granted I will have more at 60, but I've largely focused in certain other areas, since going oom is very seldom an issue for me.  When left to donation, people don't realize this, apparently.  You might make 10pp on a cast, if people bother donating.  Back before KEI came out, I never /ooc'd about casting, but when I did c/c2 on request, I got a donation maybe one cast out of twenty.  Due to the sheer volume of people requesting KEI, an enchanter could quickly become simply a buff machine for everyone else with little or no reward for their time spent.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, many enchanters still cast for donations, and occasionaly there's a free MGB of KEI on Innoruuk server.  I hope this indicates that there are still many people who acknowledge the four points above.  I'm not advocating 100pp per cast; I'm saying, consider their effort, and be fair.<br>
<br>
KEI'ers who are also tradeskillers should consider other options for lower level characters.  Perhaps a stack of some low-level component that you need in exchange for the cast, since the KEI'er would otherwise have to farm the components him/herself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drainer>Drainer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#330000>(5/19/03 8:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A tale of Enchanter Greed...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Oh one final note to all you people who do ask for KEI from an Enchanter.

<br>
Brilliant!  I couldn't agree more.<br>
<br>
I cast KEI for cash in the plane of knowledge after I get about 4 tells.  I do trade skills a lot so am there a lot.  I sometimes make people find me for KEI (brew barrel, forge, pottery wheel etc) and will give it to them free if they put in the effort to at least come to me.  I never cast KEI for free on people who demand it or ask me in a dude speak tell &quot;hey bro, can u kei me&quot;. Once in a while a fellow trade skiller will come along dual wielding steins and they get it for free and I usually get some conversation.<br>
<br>
I paid for KEI before 60 and expect that people who want KEI should also pay for it.  I usually cast on everyone, then wait 30 mins and cast it on everyone again.  Seems crowds spawn every 30 mins needing it.<br>
<br>
g'luck out there.<br>

Yes my main is an enchanter, no he is not high enough just yet, at 52. I get real tired of the warrior and monk and rogue being the only ones that my group clarity lands on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But seriously it does come down to the fact that greedy pigs of ALL classes have made things difficult on everyone. The bazaar has gone a long way toward straightening that out, by injecting some direct competition among sellers. I personally don't buy things that I feel are over priced, so I guess unless my guildmates and I go get it, or the pages to research it, I'll never have to worry about casting it cause I won't have it. I'd sooner spend my time playing a game with my friends than spend it farming green mobs so I can afford to buy a spell that some greedy jerk decided was worth 35k to 75k. I MIGHT consider paying 5K but even that I'd be bitching about. If more people would stop and consider this, and quit laying out the huge prices to the wizzy, mage, rogue, cleric, etc etc for the spell scroll in the first place, then they wouldn't be able to complain about chanters charging to cast it. They would just have to do without, or sell the scroll at a reasonable price, and then they would be justified in bitching.<br>
<br>
Oh, and as far as sitting and shouting about casting for &quot;donations of 100pp or more&quot; well, your choice to do so or not. Persoanlly I tend to ignore those that set a &quot;donation&quot; limit for any noncomponent casting. You can say all you want about haveing to make up the money of buying the scroll. That may very well be the case, but I also notice there are more enchanters riding upper level horses than any other class... guess they made up the money for the spell scroll already. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soleanla>Soleanla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#330000>(6/9/03 1:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A tale of Enchanter Greed...</span><hr size=1> Once there was an enchanter. She worked very very hard, to get levels and become an acknowledged enchanter in her society. She did not have much to offer, but she would often cast Clarity on those who needed it. Or haste buffs of various levels. She never charged for it, but appreciated the donations she received.<br>
<br>
Every now and then, she would go to the local marketplace, and have a look at the wares for sale, and every now and then a scroll called Koadic's Endless Intellect would be up for sale. Every time, it was up for 50.000 platinum pieces. The young enchantress continued to save, to be able to buy this spell.<br>
<br>
One day, she reached the 60th level of exsistance, and she ran to the bazaar, again in search of the elusive spell. When she arrived, she spotted a copy of the spell for sale for 40.000 latinum pieces. What a bargain! But alas, she had only 15.000 if the shiny metallic coins.<br>
<br>
Out of the blue, a friend steps, and offers her the remaning 25.000 platinum pieces. She thinks about it for a while, but they agree, that she will pay him back as soon as she can... She buys the spell... at the bargain price of 40.000 platinum pieces.<br>
<br>
She now spends her time online casting the spell on people around her, trying to get a donation for it, and hoping she will be able to pay back her friends kindness. If she is very lucky, she might get 500-1000 platinum pieces an hour. As she stands there, feeling like a crack dealer, feeding peoples unhealthy mana habits, she watches her friends go out and have fun...<br>
<br>
One day, she decides she is to put a price tag on her spell, or she will be there until she turns gray... And as she reads the boards of her classs, she sees this quote and she feels it justifies her actions...<br>

On Tallon Zek, C3 goes for 50p. Casters can make over 300p during the duration of having C3. 50p is dam well worth it. It is a service to other players that is indeed a bargain. You mention greed. You only say this because of the hordes of plat that come pouring into the enchanters pockets. Sounds like jealousy. Well let me give you a wake up call. Providing a service with high frequency is not greed. Raising the fees for such service however, would be considered greed. If you can't afford a service, then either don't buy it, or go increase your players income. But don't go saying a person is greedy for trying to make a profit. That's just bussiness. People are starting to charge for AEGO. I aggree that any of these long duration buffs are indeed worth charging for.<br>
<br>
Greed? Bah, I know plenty of enchanters who give discounts for players who lost their C3 within 30 minutes of being buffed. I've had plenty of friends get deals on C3 when they were low on funds. You should really knock the truly greedy player, not the enchanter populous as a whole. Get real!<br>

I paid 20k for my KEI scroll. I don't sit in the Nexus peddling. If I see multiple people begging for a KEI fix and no other enchanter is dealing with them I will offer my services. Do I take donations? Yes. Do I require or ask for donations? No.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is. If no one ever paid that &quot;Greedy Enchanter&quot; sitting in the Nexus buffing, how long would he stay? When all the greedy enchanters are run out of the Nexus to exp or farm like everyone else ... what are the KEI addicts going to do?  <p>Caralon the Crafty<br>

hehe now that that is finished...<br>
<br>
/rant for all you haters who think casting kei is for plat is a crime, you need to stfu, KEI is a service provided to you, we are not required to KEI therefore we can charge however much we want, if you dont like that, tough @#%$, nw stfu, we dont want to hear you<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
however there are a few exceptions that I know that i will make, like <br>
a. group<br>
b. raid<br>
c. guild.<br>
d. friends<br>
^<br>
I mean duh, if you charge in those situations then your ass is greedy, but otherwise charge and charge away, if you will sell it, they will come<br>
<br>
just my 2cp<br>
<br>
p.s. why the hell is a cleric coming on an enchanter board and bashing enchanters? wtf? get your mind right or the chanta mafia will be all over you <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/54778/0.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

As long as there is some gain, you'll have enchanters willing to sit and cast C3.  If people don't pay, or don't pay enough, you're going to see less and less of it.<br>
<br>
As for charging a set fee, I don't see the problem.  Just opens the door for someone else to come in and undercut the price.  On Luclin server, there is no shortage of enchanters willing and able to sell KEI.  I rarely do, since most times there are 2 people in nexus and a third in PoK selling it already.<br>
<br>
When I do sell it I never set a fee, just not my style.  If people are donating well, I'll stick around.  If I'm averaging less than 10p a person, I'll quickly move on.  Level 46+ players can certainly afford more than that and it isn't worth my time to sit there for such small change.  I can make more killing kobolds for fine steel.<br>
<br>
Again, it's economics and it is a service.  I happily pay 100p for HoV before I head to solo.  It makes my life easier and I feel I am paying well for the service some kind cleric is willing to give me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lagduffhairyfeet>Lagduff Hairyfeet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#330000>(7/13/03 1:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=53>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://lagduff.mine.nu/treehugger.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You must be joking!!!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Hmm.. well sorry to see that Damerr has so much pent up anger toward enchanters<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So was completely naked and broke. So I decided to sell Kei, you want to know the majority of 45+ people donate is 10pp or less a bunch of people scam into a full group and disband after kei is cast without donating period. I was asked once to cast kei on an entire group for donation...I was given 2 shard's from pov worth 2pp. You occasionally get the 50+ donation which is really nice but in the long run it's not worth it. So I stopped casting kei. <br>
<br>
I got into a exp group in solro tower the other day and made 160kpp(selling ornate armor) in 5hours while earning 4aa. Now you figure for 5hrs sitting in pok selling kei I prolly wouldnt have made much more than 10kpp...and absolutly no exp.<br>
<br>
On my old server as I had more than enough pp in the bank to do and buy whatever I really wanted I would end my raid night by casting MGB Kei in nexus for free. I would occasionaly buff the random people begging for Kei and refuse any kind of donation. Or on the really bored days I would sit and cast kei for free and again cancel any donation offer.<br>
<br>
The moral of this is that it really isn't worth selling kei to PL someone else who honestly thinks you are only worth 10pp. I say if you need the cash demand donation for a invite to group and if you feel the donation not enough cancel the trade and wait for someone else.<br>
<br>
I refuse to be a c3 whore anymore. <br>

<br>
Yes I agree alot of you had to work hard to get your spells, but I think alot are going over the top on being greedy.<br>
<br>
In general, and this is going to sound like a flame,  Enchanters are the whinniest most selfabsorbed people in the EQ world.  I have been an Enchanter for 2 years, I lead a guild, I have 110 played days, I am no noob,  and I have seen the way Enchanters in general act.  I have read a multitude of boards, and I am not pleased at the selfishness inherent in the Enchanter community.<br>
<br>
Yes clerics alot of times charge for resses, yes druids charge for ports, but because one person is selfish does it mean you should be?<br>
<br>
