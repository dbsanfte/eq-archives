At 16 enchanters rock, so just do whatever you can to get up to that point. Mainly work on getting spells you need.<br>
<br>
Equipment to try to get as you get up to 16:<br>
<br>
Stein of Moggok (easy)<br>
Crude Stein (around 30pp i think)<br>
Jade Electrum Bracers<br>
<br>
...and eventually...<br>
<br>
Savants Cap (+3 int)<br>
Black Iron Medallion (+3 int)<br>
<br>
Just remember having a high INT isn't going to help you much until 20+ (or even 30+). Once I hit 25 I started to pay more attention on my INT and CHA. At that point money is better and you have more options.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps, I will happy to add more as I think of it. <p><hr><center><img src="http://blackhole.cs.uwec.edu/~krauspa/yaden.jpg"><BR><B><I>Yaden Samsara</B> Enchanter 34</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/udukemonty.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DukeMonty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#330000>(2/16/01 2:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfaqs.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Thanks</span><hr size=1> Yes - it does help. Thanks. For my part, I have made 16 and by hunting the sisters I have been able to buy all the spells I need as well have around 40pp sitiing around. I have yet to quest for the stein - which I think is next but I have 2 important questions to ask:<br>
<br>
1) I had not read any posts on the enchanter class until around lvl 12 and am now coming to regret the fact that I created an Enchanter that follows Tunare. Without being Agnostic I have found that illusions are almost worthless. Should I dump this character?<br>
<br>
2) Okay, when I was walking through East Karana my pet attracted the attention of a few monsters. When they killed my pet, I tired to color flux/memblur them but I was always too busy being hit to have this work. How in the heck does an enchanter being chased by 2 mobs survive it? (note: I may have actually mem-blurred one of the prarie hounds, but standing close to it it just went instantly aggro again)<br>
<br>
Any insisghts on how we can live solo without begging for sows?<br>

But it hasn't made a difference.  And my illusions are working great so far, only place I can't get into is Neriak after killing those guards and orcs in crushbone.  But if you feel that you won't have a hard time getting back to where you are I would say go ahead and re-create your character.  If not play with it and see what happens, I found out around 15ish or so and figured it'd be harder to re-create, so I didn't do it, but that was before I knew all the good hunting spots and there weren't hunting guides all over the net..<br>

The quests are good and not too difficult.  <br>
<br>
The best thing to do at this level is to learn your spells inside and out and know what they can and can't do.  At level 16 you pretty much have the basic spells, it doesn't get all too much different... just more toys to play with down the road.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Learning them now will make you stand out later.  My suggestion would be to bind yourself on the dock in Freeport, take the boat going toward BB, go past Sister Island and jump off the boat on the right side when you pass through the two rock formations.  Those are the two sirens, they won't aggro until attacked and they don't give faction.  Make a pet and buff up.  This was the all time best way for me to learn about 1) my pet, 2) my spells, and 3) crowd control.  On those rocks there's really only a few options: live, die, gate, or swim for it and die in the water because the sirens WILL chase you.  I leveled 2 enchanters from 12 to 16 here and it was the absolute best practice for keeping myself alive by my own means, a skill that my group sure appreciates at this stage of my game.  Sure I died a lot but once I figured out what I was doing it was like a finely tuned piano.  Those two sirens are *fast* and they hit *hard* against a wimpy enchanter.  And with only your spells, a weapon, and a pet at your disposal you really force yourself to test the limits.  If you finish off those two sirens you can swim to the other side, run around the bottom of the rocks (aqua goblins up top... greenies, but annoying) and there's a single siren that spawns there.<br>
<br>
Concerning religion, this is up to you.  NPC faction is strange... if you don't mind spending time restoring or gaining faction in order to complete a quest then I'd say stick with your current enchanter.  You'll do fine.  Otherwise it's never too late to start over.  My first enchanter was about to turn level 20 and I restarted her as agnostic... best decision I ever made.  That's strictly up to you.<br>
<br>
Concerning the flux spells... if the mob is resisting the spell you need to tashan it quickly and try to stun it.  If it keeps interrupting your flux then you need to work on timing when you start casting vs when the mob is hitting you.  Later on you'll get more color stuns so you can chain stun and each lasts a bit longer.  Very effective for interrupting casting mobs and stunning about 4 or 5 that aggro'd on you so can dash to a safe spot and AE mez the pack. <p>Dellenn<BR>

Flux is fast, you can easily cast it with two lightning fast sirens pounding on without an interrupt.  Also, you can get off a mez during that stun time which at least has a more reliable duration than root which oftentimes breaks with little or no warning catching you off guard; and I found root to be resisted more than mez in general.  Also, the spell regen cycle on mem blur is way too long to rely on root when battling two sirens.  If you have anything more than two mobs... I wouldn't advise doing that until you get AE memblur.  The thing about the sirens that is unique from say most other mobs is that they don't aggro, so in this case memblur could work.  If you were to try that at the LOIO against goblins all you would do is keep reaggroing yourself if you can't get out of range fast enough.  At least with mezing something and membluring you have a lot more time to either invis or just plain run for it.  Also, if it's a casting mob then root won't help you much. <p>Dellenn<BR>
