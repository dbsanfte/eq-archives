<br>
I am developing a guide for Aggro Management. I want a general section followed by specifics for each class on how to manage their aggro. I would like a little about the level differences, faction, actions (ie don’t sit), ect <br>
<br>
If anyone has some advice please post it here. I am running this post on multiple sites. When I get enough research/input, I will compile a guide. <br>
<br>
Thank you in advance for your expertise and observations, <br>

<br>
I'm sure you'll explain more in your guide about "don't sit" but I'd say that's not a good way to avoid aggro :) Don't sit when you shouldn't sit is more my rule. :lol<br>
<br>
As for enchanters aggro control, Memory Blur and Recurring Amnesia are our main, straight-forward tools. Mezzes have a mem wipe component to them, too. With Luclin, we have Haunting Visage and Calming Visage, supposedly aggro increaser and decreaser, but I have yet to see their effects.<br>
<br>
I know if I've managed to get too much aggro, Memblur is my friend. If I want to get aggro, memblur then nuke.<br>

This is only a general review of the process and is modified for every mob and circumstance accordingly.<br>
<br>
1) Instructions: <br>
a) Combat roles assigned/reviewed (include an order for MA as they fall)<br>
b) CR/campout/Evac process established,<br>
c) Establish what to expect (resists needed, Does mob AoE/Summon?)<br>
d) Loot rules established.<br>
<br>
2) Prepare for pull:<br>
a) Resist gear choices rechecked,<br>
b) Buffs cast (trash buffs cast first if needed),<br>
c) Cast Regen, Haste, and Damage Shields on the Puller.<br>
<br>
2) Prepare for assist:<br>
b) Buffs refreshed (trash buffs cast first if needed),<br>
c) Cast Regen, Haste, and Damage Shields on the group.<br>
<br>
3) Acquire target:<br>
a) The Main Assist (MA) acquires target (from Puller if used),<br>
b) MA builds aggro before the other tanks assist. <br>
<br>
4) Assist Called:<br>
a) Other Tanks and Melee assist MA from max effective range (and opposite the MA when able), <br>
b) Placement makes it easier to visibly monitor the combat for aggro, target and tank health, targeting during combat, control mob knock-back, and tell if someone gets summoned.<br>
<br>
5) Once aggro is established (generally 50-75%):<br>
a) Casters debuff target mob,<br>
b) Healers alternate the Prime Healer role on MA to spread the aggro,<br>
c) Assist Healers (Shaman/Druid) watch the healers and caster in case of Summon or aggro.<br>
<br>
6) When target is ready to run (generally 25%):<br>
a) Movement control is established (root/snare/etc).<br>
<br>
General Notes:<br>
1) If you get aggro, do not move until aggro is removed. You will just kite the mob and mess up placement,<br>
2) When sitting and summoned, do not hit the stand key. Summoned you will be hit and thus would actually be sitting again, <br>
3) People will die, do not panic. Follow the established policy (see the Instructions section).<br>
4) Helping friends is nice, but do not jeopardize the combat by bailing friends out. Follow the established policy (see the Instructions section).<br>

Even with Recurring Amnesia, i still seem to have agro after mezzing and debuffing.. so i ROOT the mob (low level: short term and low mana).. much more efficient and after the tank hits em a few times, they forget about me anyways..<br>

<br>
====================================<br>
Posted on Clerics of EverQuest http://pub29.ezboard.com/fclericsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=471.topic<br>
====================================<br>
<br>
This comes for various compilations that we're combined on the Strategies section of our ezboard, and are the best I have come across to date. Hope it helps you out  <br>
<br>
WARRIORS:<br>
1) Highest warrior is ALWAYS main tank!!<br>
2) AC is GOD!!! If you are 55+ and have not reached 1000 AC, get on the ball, you are falling behind and its gonna bite you in the ass.<br>
3) Always fight in front of the mob, don't try to hide from the riposte, you are in front of the mob to counterbalance the damage from behind the mob and try to keep him in 1 spot and not let him move.<br>
4) DON'T TAUNT!!! Unless you are MA of course.<br>
5) DON'T BASH/SLAM!!!<br>
6) Your job is to keep aggro on the main tank then get aggro when/if main tank dies.<br>
7) SET A TANK ORDER IN WHICH TO FIGHT IN!! (list is based off LEVEL then AC then HITPOINTS)<br>
8 ) ALWAYS FIGHT AT MAX MELEE (furthest you can stand away from mob while still hitting him, see "The Bubble" graphic at the end of post), with the exception of the main tank who needs to stand on the mobs toes.<br>
9) ALWAYS USE DEFENSIVE DISC UNLESS TOLD OTHERWISE!!!<br>
<br>
PALADINS / SHADOWKNIGHTS:<br>
1) DON'T TAUNT!!!!<br>
2) DON'T BASH/SLAM!!!!<br>
3) Fight in front of the mob.<br>
4) If you aggro, turn atk off and step back, give the main tank time to get aggro back.<br>
5) ALWAYS FIGHT AT MAX MELEE!!!<br>
6) AC IS GOD!!!!<br>
7) SKs, if a mob is able to be lifetapped SHOUT it, it means the mob has low resist to MR and DR/PR which ever is life tap I forget.<br>
8 ) Save disciplines until absolutely needed, SK's most of all, unholy aura is a godly discipline.<br>
<br>
ROGUES / MONKS:<br>
You guys out damage warriors 4 to 1 or even more in the case of 55+ rogues. REMEMBER we have to out taunt your damage! Don't try to show off to get your group experience and get your ass killed!!<br>
1) ALWAYS FIGHT BEHIND THE MOB!!! It is your job to adjust yourselves, not the tanks job to adjust the mobs to you.<br>
2) Don't backstab/super kick the moment a mob reaches camp, wait 5 or 10 secs to give the main tank time to get aggro.<br>
3) ALWAYS FIGHT AT MAX MELEE!!!!<br>
4) You don't have the hitpoints like warriors/paladins/SKs, so don't aggro if possible, if you aggro turn atk off and step back. RESIST GEAR is very important in AE fights because when you reach 2 bubbles of life left mobs frenzy on you and you just out taunted the warrior without doing anything but dying!<br>
5) Remove aggro processing weapons!!!<br>
<br>
RANGERS:<br>
Oh man what I could say about you guys!!!<br>
1) MAX MELEE ALWAYS!!! The most important thing for rangers.<br>
2) DON'T TAUNT!!!<br>
3) Where you fight is dependant on how many of which class there is in the fight although you dont have the hitpoints for the ripostes you guys are great at moving mobs.<br>
4) DON'T WIELD HIGH AGGRO PROCESSING WEAPONS!!!!<br>
<br>
SHAMAN / ENCHANTERS / MAGES:<br>
1) Debuffs are often the deciding factor in a fight, tish/slow/malo/etc., are very important but don't get ahead of yourselves, they will also cause you to get aggroed immediately. Give the main tank time to taunt before you cast. Have seperate people try to malo/tish/slow and once landed make sure people know! Also, if you can't land it let people know!<br>
<br>
WIZARDS AND ALL OTHERS WITH DD NUKES:<br>
The gods of DD!!!<br>
1) ONE RULE ONLY: Wait until mobs hit 50% life before you nuke...DUH!!! Well most of you guys have itchy trigger fingers and don't so try to remember.<br>
2) Also make sure to wear resist gear to fights where there will be AE!!<br>
<br>
CLERICS:<br>
The saviors!<br>
1) No longer do you worry about your group only, now you all protect the lead tank. YOU ALL NEED TO MAKE A HOT KEY SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING!!!!! This is a example of a cleric order and Drushala as the main tank:<br>
<br>
Branwaric:<br>
/ooc Casting Complete Heal on Drushala (make sure it works for your target in case Drushala dies)<br>
<br>
/pause 25<br>
<br>
/ooc HEELZ START CASTING COMPLETE HEAL NOW!!!!<br>
<br>
Heelz: Immediately when you see the message calling your name, no matter what Drushala's life is at, cast CH<br>
<br>
/ooc Casting CH on Drushala<br>
<br>
/pause 25<br>
<br>
/ooc RESQ START NOW!!!<br>
<br>
Resq: start casting when you see that message<br>
<br>
Same as the 2 above pass to next cleric or pass back to Branwaric.<br>
<br>
CLERICS: Try to always have at least 3 clerics in your CH chain on uber mobs, this will not apply to all mobs obviously but works well for most and having 3 or more gives the clerics in the chain time to heal thier group also.<br>
<br>
DRUIDS / NECROMANCERS:<br>
1) Druids can help with group healing (in the case of AE or over aggro damage), and they can also use DD or DoT type spells. Follow the same guidelines as Wizards.<br>
2) Necromancers have some of the best DoT spells in the game. Try to use one that causes little initial damage to reduce the chance of aggro. Also, if you don't have an essence emerald on you or at the very least a regular emerald at all times and you are over 53, GET ONE!!! With FD capabilities it is not uncommon for the necromancer to be the sole survivor after a raid wipeout. A coffin is always handy as well.<br>
<br>
The Bubble:<br>
<br>
If you follow these guidelines and position yourself as shown below, there is no mob that any raid can't handle. If you need to be close to the mob to cast your spells, move in range and after casting, slowly back out so that the tank can regain aggro if necessary. DO NOT RUN!!!! Take the hits and trust that the tank is taunting their butt off to regain control. The easiest way to determine what MAX MELEE RANGE is, is to watch any pets that may be present. They typically will stop moving toward the mob when they hit that spot.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.etheios.org/images/bubble.jpg"><br>
<br>
Practice the bubble in daily groups whenever you can and especially on raids. With everyone doing their part there is NO mob we can't conquer. This is a very effective strategy!!! <br>

As I stated from the creation of this post, I am building an Aggro Management Guide. This is not an absolute strategy or walk-through approach. I am attempting to decipher the factors that the game uses to determine aggro. These dynamics happen to be observed best in larger raids. The best way to accomplish this is generating discussion on class specific sites to ascertain how they each interact to refine the process the game uses to determine aggro. Once the process is modeled, a guide (observation) can be created to share the both the model and advice from each class discussion to control the model. This will become the Aggro Management Guide. Currently, I am still observing the game mechanics of the “umber” raids and attempting to refine the aggro model (this is a lengthy process since I maintain an active, dynamic real life). Meanwhile, I hope the discussions being generated on each of the cross-referenced message boards will provide a catalyst for members to communicate. Perhaps educating themselves and sharing knowledge with those whom are beginning to grasp the importance of Aggro Management. <br>

<br>
Im assuming that you are talking about raids on level 60+ mobs and what an enchatners job is in aggro control.<br>
On raid unlike exp groups the enchanter CANNOT use root,memblur or stuns because the mob is immune due to level or the spells would destroy aggro resulting in loss of aggro on MT.<br>
<br>
The new lucin aggro spells have a prefound effect on aggro. They are a buff that lasts for 18 seconds and during that 18 seconds the actions of the buffed person generate a % more or less aggro.<br>
<br>
Beguiling Visage Self Only Aggro Reduction Spell (Max: 50%)<br>
This has a long recast and must be memed 15 minute before use. It allows you to cast tash almost a few seconds after MT gets aggro without you getting agro yourself. Getting MR debufs on fast is very important to allow a slow to land(if mob unslowable then a speedy debuf isn't as important)<br>
 <br>
Glamorous Visage Single Target Aggro Reduction Buff (Max: 30%) <br>
This spell has a 18 second duration and a 36 second recast. It should be used on clerics to reduce their aggro. It is imperitive that you sycronise the casting of this spell on the cleric casting the first complete heal of the fight  since they are very lightly to get aggro and die.<br>
<br>
Horrifying Visage Single Target Aggro Increaser Buff (Max: 30%) <br>
This spell has a 18 second duration and a 36 second recast. It should be used on the MT to increase his aggro. Important times to use this is just before he engages the mob and to use it on the secondary tank during a change of MT.<br>
<br>
Working with other enchanters you can keep the MT always aggro buffed and reduce much of the cleric aggro.<br>

 Agro....something I luv )<br>
As an enchanter I have played with this extensively, to some peoples dismay. I have it down so much that I can sit down and stand up in one motion have the beast run my way and turn back around real fast to get the beat down. <br>
But as far as giving a guide for an enchanter it would be super long. Ill give a few tips.<br>
A. if you cast tash, then nuke nuke nuke u can keep agro the whole battle(dont recomend doing this unless u just messing around and your cleric knows)<br>
B. If you cast a mez in hate with like 4 or 5 mobs coming and only an arrow as agro from the main tank u most likely will die then your cleric too unless u have some real quality folks there<br>
C. All chanter spells have a agro issue, including our dd's that have a taunt<br>
I recomend all chanter play with agro when they can until they understand it fully.<br>

<br>
<br>
Ah… a guide to aggro management for an Enchanter is practically a guide to playing the class. Aggro management defines our class. I will concentrate on the 50 plus play but the techniques I think are applicable to all levels of play.<br>
<br>
MEZZMERIZATION<br>
<br>
“Inc…3 maybe more. Mezz the adds”<br>
<br>
If I had a plat for every time I have seen this one I would have a horse or two J<br>
<br>
We have two mezz choices when faced with adds; Area of Effect (AoE) mezz or single target mezz. Both are huge aggro inducers;<br>
<br>
AoE MEZZ<br>
<br>
AoE Mezz is unarguably one of the most powerful spells in the game. One cast and you can have up to 4 MOBs just standing there awaiting their fate. But… when mezz breaks you will have 4 MOBs thirsty for your blood.<br>
<br>
Level 16 mezz lasts 24 seconds, level 52 lasts 36 seconds. Each MOB has it’s own individual chance of resisting the spell. I have had it work/ fail in every combination from all mezzed to all resists. Using this spell is a huge risk for the Enchanter and for the group. I think it is perhaps the most frequently misused spell we have.<br>
<br>
Even though most Enchanters have maxed channeling skills, one or more annoyed MOBs beating on you is going to make it difficult for you to get off an individual mezz on the one(s) that resisted. It is far better in most cases to allow the agro to remain on the puller while you individually mezz the adds. <br>
<br>
However, this does not mean that the spell doesn’t have it’s uses. There are places where most of the critters have low Magic Resistance (MR) and using this spell is mana efficient and smart. Just remember to keep your own MR high so if you don’t have the time to move out of casting range you will not succumb to it yourself.<br>
<br>
AoE mezz can be cast sequentially keeping all the MOBs mezzed until your group has dealt with them or you run out of mana. If you did not start the fight with full mana it is unlikely you will be able to keep casting AoE mezz until all MOBs are dead. I don’t think I have started a fight with full mana since I was level 20. The other disadvantage to AoE mezz is that all the MOBs mezzed thusly will unmezz at the exact same time.<br>
<br>
This is where the group can help you tremendously. Make sure they know you used AoE mezz and a smart group will immediately start rooting the mezzed MOBs. If their root does not have a damage component mezz will not be broken, but even if it does a rooted MOB that is angry at the Ranger that just rooted him is less a threat to the group than one still after you. They can take a few more hits than your poor silk-clad body can. Snaring of the Mezzed mobs is also a big help. We may not be able to stand and take hits but we can move around pretty fast and a snared MOB is more easily outmaneuvered.<br>
<br>
If your group is otherwise occupied and you see no help on the horizon you can stun. I love our stuns. We have some great stuns and most do not have a huge effect radius. If your mezz hit 4 critters your higher level stun can hit the same 4. When you know the spell is about to break stun them and as they come unmezzed, individually remezz one and immediately recast AoE mezz. In this way you can eventually get them all individually mezzed and have them under control for a much longer time with less mana use. “Eventually” is the key word here. This requires a lot of mana and flawless targeting. A rare combination in most brawls.<br>
<br>
INDIVIDUAL MEZZ<br>
<br>
We get a whole series of these spells form the 26 second Mesmerize at level 4 to a 96 second Mesmerize at lvl 49. We get two higher level mezzes, both are of shorter duration ( 30 and 26 second) but much lower resist. All create instant aggro when they fail. The MOB will make a bee-line for you every time. So it is best to cast these at the maximum distance possible, leaving you time to duck behind the main tank, root, stun, or yell for help if it fails. Whatever you do, DO NOT run. Beaming a smile at the Cleric about then would be a much better approach. Unlike AoE mezz, when these spells are resisted you only have one angry MOB. I almost always can cast through being hit by one MOB. <br>
<br>
CHARM<br>
<br>
This is a tough one when it comes to aggro management. If the puller brings 2 MOBs, it is low risk to cast a Charm on one and have an unwilling ally for the fight. If Charm doesn’t stick, you can always Mezz it, although it will be beating on you because Charm has the same aggro inducing component as Mezz. More than two MOBs you have to decide if the puller can take the abuse while you use the slower casting Charm and risk having to recast a mezz. You also need to consider the effect on the group if the Cleric has to start healing you in the middle of a fight because you Charm broke and your ex-pet is trying to have you for lunch. <br>
<br>
I use Charm a lot more now at 57 than I did prior to 55. The reason is how hard the MOBs hit where I hunt now (which is mostly in Luclin) Even a solid group of 55 plus have a hard time handling 3 or more of the 55 plus MOBs. The Clerics will be out of mana about halfway through the third one. If you have a Charmed MOB helping out it can make a huge difference. If you Charm a MOB that is already rooted, so much the better. Get the tank to move the fight over within reach of your new pet and you have the extra damage it does with very little additional agro to manage.\<br>
<br>
STUNS<br>
<br>
These will save your life. You will frequently be told NOT to use your stuns. If it is a raid and the raid leader is telling you this… obey. If it is anyone else look around and see for yourself. Stuns give you those precious seconds you need to retry a mezz or a Charm and our higher level stuns even have a mana drain component. <br>
<br>
RUNE<br>
Our Rune spells give a damage absorption shield ranging from Rune I at level 16 (absorbs 55 points max,) to Rune V at level 52 (absorbs 700 points max.) You will get beat on… no matter how good you think you are there will always be one MOB that does not know you are invincible J I keep Rune on myself almost all the time. It cost a fortune and no one ever thinks to give the Enchanter peridots… after all we mostly just cast Rune on ourselves. But for managing agro it cannot be beat. I can cast with 3 things beating on me if my Rune holds. I also cast Rune on the Cleric if we are in a tough place. Rune can also be used as a heal of last resort. If the Cleric is oom and your MA is down to half a bubble, that extra 700 points can make all the difference. Be warned however, the MOBs consider it a heal and they can agro on you for casting it.<br>
<br>
MEM BLURR<br>
<br>
We have several spells in this category and I have to confess that they are the most unfairly underutilized spells in my book. All these spells are supposed to reduce your ranking on the NPCs ‘hate list.’ They are also supposed to me nearly irresistible and at the higher levels are described as irresistible. I have found this not to be the case.<br>
<br>
Memory Blur at level 12 is a single target spell that takes 2.5 seconds to cast and had a 12 second recast time. I used it frequently in my teens and lower 20s but around the time I gfot Clarity (level 29) I noticed that the MOBs appeared to resist it much more frequently. It is not a huge mana user but I found myself memming it less and less till I did not use it at all. He reason had to do with spell management. There is no class hat has to swap spells as frequently as an Enchanter. I have played all but 4 classes into their 20’s and I think I am safe in saying that the Enchanter has to do more spell swapping than anyone. I just did not have room for a spell with a 12 second recast time that did not always work.<br>
<br>
We get Mind Wipe (level 39) and Blanket of Forgetfulness (level 49) both “irresistible” AoE mem blurs. Well I have had both get resisted no matter what Verant says. They take 4.5 seconds to cast. I rarely have a spare 4.5 seconds in a battle. At one time they had the peculiar effect of making everyone’s pet wander off. I think they have fixed this but I have been hesitant to use the AoE mem blurr when grouped with a pet class. The tongue lashing I got from the Necro whose Joboer wandered off with a 30pp sword he had just given it is still fresh in my mind &lt;sigh&gt; <br>
<br>
I have been using the single target Reoccurring Amnesia. This is a persistent memory blur and can be cast first before Tash or anything else. It “recasts” itself every 6 seconds. It however like all the others can be resisted but if I have a slot and time I keep it memmed and it does reduce or eliminate the agro.<br>
<br>
When in a group of friends, with a puller that is not playing “Swamp the Enchanter,” I use the Mem blur spells quite effectively. However in Raid situations there are so many MOBs aggroed at one time you can never count on these spells mem blurring the right one and that elusive open slot never seems to materialize for it.<br>
<br>
VISAGE SPELLS<br>
<br>
There are four new spells that are suppose to be agro assignment spells. Two will increase agro on the target, two will decrease agro. I only have the lower level two and have seen no effect on agro when I cast them. The higher level ones are dropped spells and I have not been fortunate enough to acquire them.<br>
<br>
<br>
ASSIST<br>
<br>
Assist works quite differently for an Enchanter than for most. If you /assist the puller you will get the best target NOT to mezz. This is the MOB the puller will be taking to the MA and the MOB everyone first sees and will most likely attack. The one you want is the MOB running after the puller, the one which the puller did not engage last. This MOB is the “ADD.” This MOB will not be getting taunted attacked or otherwise have it’s agro removed from the puller. You can however use /assist on the puller when he is intentionally bringing in MOBs before the group has finishes with their current MOB and counting on you to put them on ice for the group.<br>
<br>
SITTING<br>
<br>
Have I mentioned we have to switch spells out more than just about anyone? And you have to sit to do this. MOBs immediately agro on you when you sit if you have had anything to do with them. Mem blur works nicely if you know you have to swap spells and have it up already. Unfortunately I usually find myself wanting to sit and mem Mem Blur. Wait… do not sit as soon as the tank has managed to taunt it off you. He will be annoyed when he has to taunt it all over again. And distance is critical. Get as far away as you can without aggroing something else and sit there. Do not sit in an annoyed MOBs lap.<br>
<br>
Hope this is of some help. I know I have missed some agro management aspects and probably included some things not directly related. But hopefully it will help in understanding what an Enchanter can and cannot do with respect to agro management.<br>
