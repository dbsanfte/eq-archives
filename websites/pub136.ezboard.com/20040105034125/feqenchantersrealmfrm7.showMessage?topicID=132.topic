He has been around a long time (2.5 years), but I had not started this until the end of last year. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I thought I would look back into the quest and write up my memories in case anybody cares.  When I started, I was level 57.  Now, I am 65.  I had a Velketor's Spellbook in my primary before this, but the Snake gives better resists, charisma, and its pet clicky for me.<br>
<br>
Anyway....a long, long time ago...on a server far away....<br>
<br>
Ink of the Dark - I am agnostic and did not have a problem with the Bloodsabers (also I am human).  The scribe was an easy camp, and I used my cleric (level 51 at the time) to help me break the spawn.<br>
<br>
Mechanical Pen - I had an SMR I was wearing anyway from camping the ArchMagus in the 40s.  I won a Vah Shir Skin Robe which allowed me to give across my SMR.<br>
<br>
Thrackin Griften - Not really a problem for us.  Had a group between 55 and 60.  I brought my cleric along just in case, but I had a druid heal for the event.  I bound near Thrackin and ran to the hand in.  I did the hand in and gated back to Thrackin.<br>
<br>
Did the handin to Stofo and to Jeb.  I did this pass at Jeb during the short time when lull lasted a very long time.  Just lulled them and did the handins.<br>
<br>
At this point, I started doing the easy stuff.....<br>
<br>
Snow Blossoms - I just went in Ogre form and ran back and forth till it was done.  No real problem.<br>
<br>
One Key - Pretty easy to lev down to it.  I had to do it twice, the first time it was not there.<br>
<br>
Lost Scroll - I had been to Dalnir's with an alt a couple of weeks before this.  With Improved Invis, ran all the way no problem.  The loc is fairly close to the zoneout at the end of the dungeon.<br>
<br>
Book of Charm and Sacrifice - Have a wizzie friend and bought the port stone.  Pretty straight foward.<br>
<br>
At this point, I ran to Nadia and got all the gems.<br>
<br>
Diamond - I did the charm at the basement of Kaesora.  Easy to get to for a high 50s chanter.  There was a group at the library.   They let me charm and I buffed them.  Took 3 clearings to get the spawn.<br>
<br>
Spoon and Second Piece of the Staff  - At this point my guild was aware that I was doing the epic.  There was a guy with a spoon from Cazel in the bank.  So, I got that from him and completed Mizzle.<br>
<br>
Now things slowed down a bit.<br>
<br>
I made a DE alt to set up at Verina Tombs and a Lizzie alt to set up at Vessel Drozlin.<br>
<br>
Chalice of Kings - However, before I got them my guild did a massive Chardok raid.  We killed the Prince twice, King twice, and Queen twice.  We had 4 groups and got epic drops from each kill.  We had one group plow to the safe hall and CoHed down.  I have done it since with a 2 group raid and we just plowed down.  Both ways worked.  We have never gotten the Prince to come on his own, so crowd control is a must.<br>
<br>
Rod of Xolion and Mystic Sands - Then, Verina Tombs popped but by the time I got there she was taken.  Then Vessel Drozlin popped and we got him with 2 groups.  He is a pretty hard conn for his level.  We went out into the FoB and found the Tangrin up, we killed him easily.  Remember to lev your people to avoid the stun.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk's Word - Verina popped again for me and I got her with 4 people.  She is very easy, especially when compared to Drozlin.<br>
<br>
First Piece of the Staff - This all took about 2 weeks.  Wow, I was saying to myself this is going to be not too bad.  I went to Modani Qu'loni and found him.  I aggroed him a couple of times by mistake but was able to gate out each time.  Did that hand in (hardest hand in I had).<br>
<br>
Ruby - At this point, I began running CoM raids every other Saturday Morning.  We got many a Reaver on these raids, but it took me 4 raids (probably a total of 8 hours) camping the Wraith of Jaxion to get him to spawn.  My guess is I was unlucky.  These raids got me started on being a raid leader, which I have done many times since.<br>
<br>
Emerald - One night I took my cleric (run by my son for this) and tried Impaler Tzilug.  I runed myself and decided to try to Charm him at his camp before I got aggro.  Well, this failed miserably and I ate the HTs from all 5 mobs (Impaler and 4 guards).  Lovely....I ran.  Well, I am not sure its me or what but I was able to get out with only the Imapler following me.  My cleric healed me with about 10% hps left and I mezzed the impaler.  I tashed and charmed.  Very scarey.  If I had to do it again, I would take a group there.<br>
<br>
Sapphire - Then I started camping Felia Goldenwing.  It took several nights of camping the named cycle (probably 6 - 8 hours total) when we finally got her.  Having a tracker for this is almost essential.<br>
<br>
Third Piece of the Staff - So, now I have all the stuff for Nadia and do that hand-in.  Wow 3 pieces down and about 8 weeks into it.  Not bad as we are doing a lot of other stuff as well.<br>
<br>
Essence of a Vampire - During these times, we were running about 1 Hate Raid every other week for epic drops.  I got my Essence of Vampire off of a Male Revenant on raid number 4.  In many ways, this is frustrating.  We killed dozens of revenants and I have only seen 2 essences drop.<br>
<br>
Then, the guild I was in basically fell apart.  Its still together but in a very different context.  We were just finishing up HOT raids and just killed Vindi for the first time (had 4 60+ clerics).  2 weeks later, my alt cleric was the highest active cleric in the guild.  The guild has since rebuilt and had another wave of exits and rebuilt again.  I left in the second wave and went to a brand new guild.  We had 2 62+ clerics so it would seem Fear was no issue.  Then one of them got sent on lots of business travel.  I wasn't going to do Fear with one cleric.  This was April.<br>
<br>
Essence of a Ghost - In one of the guild rebuilding attempts, we had a shammy that needed to see Kirn.  So, I took a 2 group raid to the undead tower and while we were there I got Kindle.  (I know from our visit to the Hole Sunday she is no longer in the Undead Tower).<br>
<br>
Head of a Serpent - Fast forward to Sunday.  We had learned in July we could now run 1 group Fear Breakins to check on mobs.  The vast bulk of the mains are 65.  So, we did a Fear Break Sunday and there she was (as were 2 of the Golems).  I had had her up once before (in January) but the guild wiped and decided to call it a day.<br>
<br>
Now we have this very sophisticated Amy temple strategy.....Get all the mobs you can and kite them.  Pick them off 1 or 2 at a time and whittle the kite down.  Well, this should have worked but our puller died when we had only picked off a couple of them.....so about 20 mobs inc.  We had 2 chanters working in overdrive, but only the puller died.  We took the Wraith first and I looted.  I figured if we were going to wipe, I was going to loot before it rotted.  The entire guild laughed at this, but understood.<br>
<br>
Fourth Piece of the Staff - We went to the Hole on Monday and found Polzin basically unmoved.   The mobs near him are a bit harder than they used to be.  Some have reported a locked door to get to him.  I did not experience this.<br>
<br>
Staff of the Serpent - I then went to Jeb.  I slow pulled the Sarnaks around him and my Animation killed them without a problem.  And voila Staff of the Serpent.<br>
<br>
Serial time on this was about 9 months.  Total time spent was a lot less than I spent on my Coldain Prayer Shawl.  I think it was all worth it.  Getting this done has has cleared up a lot of bank space <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
