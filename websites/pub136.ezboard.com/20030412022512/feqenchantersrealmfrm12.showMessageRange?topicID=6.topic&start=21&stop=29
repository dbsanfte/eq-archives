He is only 30 right now, but what a brick wall!!!!  Ok for all the mele's out there, WHO cares if it is haste????  The enchanter is one class with major restrictions. You know those pets/famil spells so many are running around with.  OURS suck!!  We mez or charm anything and guess who it is attacking?? Sure mind wipe is good if you have time cast it, or if your not standing next to that mob you charmed.  But what about that Melee with the haste belt who attacks the mezzed?? Guess who gets the agro?? Not the caster.  And we all know how much those nice bright colored robes and Bracelets, not bracers hold in the way of AC.  But wow at mid to high level a high AC with intel??? What a dream.  Now melee's take away all your crusty, or other with str bonus.... and look at the price or availablility.  A belt with 4 ac and 4intel which is our prime atribute costs what 300p on my server.  But a war can get his crusty or other with +8str massive AC for half that cost.... Then look at our Wis casters... Shammies, Druids, Pets eventually, damage spells, kiting, and healing, not to mention the fact best buffs for ac are from the wis community.  Good weps with Str and Wis on them for cheap prices.....  If anyone thinks that an enchanter doesn't need ac and intel, which are both on this item, then you are greatly mistaken.  Doing my outfitting at the lev of 30 I have run into a brick wall, and its expenisve if i want to buy, and I am not high enough yet to go camp or quest for.  It is not Use before Greed, It is NEED before Greed.  And yes Enchanters your crowd control, your haste spells, and you KEI person NEED AC as well as the intel.  This makes this item a definite Need. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/uxanyia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xanyia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#330000>(10/10/02 4:13:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/79324866/bc/My+Photos/__tn_xanyia_new.jpg?bct5lX8AjQ3_cHDt WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silvery Belt of Contention</span><hr size=1> I am a level 60 sk and my enchanter is 52. this is what my enchanter is wearing on her waist slot:<br>

Weight: 0.1 <br>
Classes: Necromancer Enchanter Magician Wizard  <br>
Effect: Haste Enhancement III<br>
<br>
40 mana is more than what you would get from 5 int.<br>
I am not saying it's easy to get I saw it going in the bazaar for a pretty penny, but I don't see how a silvery belt of contention should go to a caster when haste for a melee makes a huge difference in damage output.<br>
<br>
As far as the Hiero cloak goes I would wear it as a lv 60 SK because it has fantastic HP and I am close to my ac soft cap so that choosing a cloak with more ac would not benefit me much.<br>
<br>
At high levels tank types want to get as many hp as possible to maximize healing efficiency. When the cleric complete heals you you want to give them as big of a HP pool as possible.<br>
<br>
I understand you see the 5 int on it and really want it but playing my enchanter I found out that a huge mana pool is no great help since I am hardly ever FM anyway. if I am FM I tell the puller to stop slacking. Charisma on the other way helped me immensely, so now these days I go around with 225 int 247 charisma self buffed.<br>
 <br>
As for the AC for enchanters I don;t think it helps.  At higher levels mobs hit my SK for full with 1200+ ac.  For my enchanter I try to get items with HP/mana/cha.  Having 100 ac more or less doesnt help much having 100 hp more can save your life.<br>

This has much more AC, and gives 50 HPs, plus 15 INT, resists &amp; 25 Mana...<br>
<br>
The effect reduces cast time for slows (From 6 or 7 secs to 4 secs) and that's kinda cool when you have to slow quickly and you got resisted on 1st casting per example... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR>

           Do yourself a favor, and learn how the AC softcap works.  You will also discover that there is a Low end to it also, where you will (almost always) get hit for max damage.  The vast majority of INT casters live in this area, and a little AC, here and there makes little difference.  For you to not get hit you would require AC similar to warriors, and similar defensive skills (which i believe are capped much lower for enchanters)<br>
<br>
Mana is your life <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Mezzing, Buffing, and such is your life.  Enchanters are very useful. Keep playing your enchanter, but don't worry about AC, til you are raiding immensly high end zones, (and you can't avoid it)... Don't fight melee's for AC. <br>
<br>
Do you see melee's arguing that they want Flowing thought items?<br>
<br>
Anyways, take care, and enjoy EQ. it's a vast game (with many different ideas.

If you have a 50+ melle with out a haste belt....buy him one. Fbss= 600pp on Fennin Ro<br>
this belt has decent stats but if you're a melle getting 10 ac in your haste slot is prettty nice. I'd sa this would go to a non-monk melle first since all other classes get better than 10 ac in hand slot.<br>

First of all I have to ask myself why am I in Kael (or any zone)? Am I after Experience? Loot? Faction? Helping a friend or guildie? What do I expect in this zone. My Enchie is currently in Kael, partly for faction and partly helping a Cleric friend.<br>
<br>
If you are after loot please talk to everyone in your group about drops and loot rules. Try and come to a decision that is acceptable to everyone (at least as much as possible). If you cant reach an agreement then perhaps it's time to say &quot;Thanks anyway guys but I need to find another group&quot;. After all why stay and be unhappy and not have fun. Give the group a chance to replace you and NEVER NEVER just drop and run without letting them know why. <br>
<br>
I almost always group with the same people or a group of Guildmates and we never seem to have any arguments over loot. Mostly because we talk about it first. I will add that sometimes raids are more difficult to reach satisfactory agreements. But that is because instead of 6 people there may be 30 or more.<br>
<br>
Botton line - talk first and try to have fun. After all, this IS A GAME.<br>
<br>
P.S. My Enchie would LOVE to have that belt, Haste or no Haste.<br>

(my belt, which was awarded to me by my guild, has haste on it hehe)  Although, you should look at the circustances- a 10ac 5int/sta belt really isn't very good when you're a 55+ chanter.  Really, it's not.  Get an oakleaf girdle or a spider fur belt- both have hp's, which will keep you alive, and the oakleaf girdle has more mana then you'll get from the 5 int.<br>
<br>
Lemme make an analagy.  Let's say a 10ac, 10int, 50hp/mana, and 50charisma belt drops.  Now, an average equipped level 60 wizzie will look at that belt and say, &quot;Wow, that's a nice belt.  I need more int, I need more hp, I need more mana, it's got all 3!&quot;  That wizzie will say that would be a good belt for him, and he'd be right, if it's better than the belt he's wearing.  A chanter, however, will look at that belt and pitch a tent.  A very moist tent in fact.<br>
<br>
Now I ask you- who should that belt go to?  It's a good wizard belt, no one will disagree with that.  But the fact is, it's an incredibly good chanter belt.  It has &quot;give this to a chanter&quot; written all over it, and the chanter with the chubber drooling all over that belt would have every reason to be pissed at a wizzie claiming to want it based on NBG over a chanter.<br>
<br>
It's the same thing with this belt.  It's got 5int, sure, it's a somewhat good newbie belt for an int caster.  But, it has haste, sta, and ac on it which makes it one hell of a melee belt.  Sure, an int caster would like it.  A melee would cherish it as an incredibly good item.<br>
<br>
So don't be greedy and ask for this as a chanter.  You make me look bad. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>
