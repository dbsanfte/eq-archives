Players were few, but that was ok, since it meant that there was little to no squabbling over such trivial things as a certain mob, or a certain piece of loot.  Players helped each other, knowing that one day they would need help in return and it was their fellow players that would provide it.<br>
<br>
Then the world began to change.  With each new expansion, new loot was found.  And with each new expansion, new boundaries were formed to define how much money was expected to buy what loot.  Soon it came to pass that only those who had the loot could get into the raids to get more loot.  Then the people who had the loot began using it to create a new generation of people that would never know the challenge of facing a train of angry fire beetles with only a rusty sword and a guild tunic.  And this new generation had no understanding of the simple things, like spending a month trying to get to level 30, or helping a guy that needs helping, or spending 6 months saving up to buy that shiny new Mithril Breastplate.  These people seem to be weaned on greed.  They show no wish to better the Everquest community.  Instead they tell fresh new characters looking for help to go away.<br>
<br>
I have spent my 3 years in EQ helping everyone I see, no matter what lvl they are or how much plat they have in the bank.  As a cleric I give buffs and rezzes free to those who ask, as a wizard I offer ports to those in need, and with my other chars, I am equally gracious.  I am one of the few character walking around that when I get a new piece of gear I give my old gear to some newbie out there that needs it.  And after spending my EQ life in this fashion, I can say that nothing personifies this rampant greed of people wanting to exploit their fellow players for their hard earned money than enchanters charging people for Koadic's endless Intellect.<br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong, people go get paid for buff and I believe that they should, but in the form of donations.  When druis on my server started trying to charge people too much for ports I created a wizard to put them out of business offering ports for free.  Perhaps now it's time to start an enchanter.  Because when I see an enchanter making 10kpp a night from casting KEI, and turning away VERY rudely, anyone unable to pay this toll, I get angry.  I mean come on, it costs nothing to cast this spell, and the donations that people offer are more than enough to justify the time spent.  Because of this new spell, more and more high end enchanters have stopped raiding and stared sitting in Nexus fleecing the public.  This must stop.  Personally, I have created many characters, several casters, without the aid of KEI and from where I sit I will not be asking for it again.  I deplore this greedy new threat to the EQ community, and I will do everything in my power to help combat it.  I ask that any of you people of Norrath that feel as I do, please stand with me, in shunning these greedy, money hungry bastards that are corrupting our fair world of Norrath.  And I don't hold this just to enchanter, though they are the main culprit.  But to anyone that I see who is taking unfair advantage of the people of the world, beware, I keep track, and I know that me, my alts, and my friends will never be there to rez, buff, port, SoW, summon your corpse, help, or back you up.  In short, you are a pox upon Norrath and if you will not open your eyes to what you are doing, I will most assuredly shut you down.  And, there are enough people between me, my wife and a friend to keep a 60 chanter in Nexus giving out free KEI to do it 24/7.  So let's stop with the greed and remember that helping our fellow player is what make this game worth playing.  Also a dire warning to the rest of you that you may have heard before...What goes around comes around.<br>

In other words......<br>
<br>
Welcome to EQ, clerics get to DEMAND money for a rezz, Druids and Shamen get paid to SoW(Rangers now), Wizzies and Druids get to TP, Necro's summon Corpses and Enchanters...well Enchanters get into a group to Clarity and speed.<br>
<br>
Now, enchanters get KEI (IMHO VI did bad allowing this to be cast on anyone under at least L50, dont get me wrong, my twinkie mage pays for a hit as soon as the last one wears off...donation only so i pay what I think its worth, bout 50ppa shot for a L31 mage and will prolly pay more as i level up) and EVERYONE starts shouting FOUL !!!!!!<br>
<br>
Well as you posted, you dont NEED KEI to level, if you dont want it then dont pay for it. No One NEEDS a buff or an effect to level, sure it helps, Run faster, Move from Loc to Loc in the blink of an eye, be rezzed and save xp. All things you expect in a group, but also something 99% of folks CHARGE FOR WHEN NOT IN A GROUP !!<br>
<br>
WHY should Enchanters give the one buff they CAN charge for for FREE ??<br>

<br>
p.s. I dont cast KEI anymore for anything less than 100 pp.  I did donations for a while and while i have earned close to 25k from donations I get more than aggravated with people like you who choose to abuse the service I am providing.  Time after time I get stiffed and people are like 'but you said donations'  Well fine. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  now I do not do it for donations.  I do it for 100 pp per person.  Keeps the people from bugging me, and lets me go out and level and raid.  Expecting compensation for the only 3 - 4 hour superbuff in the game (for casters), allowing them to PL themselves is not greed based, it is market driven.  Your pathetic whining makes me sick.<br>

Now I care about as much for the cost of the spell as I do for how much the local warrior paid for his shiny new sword.  And I'm not the only one people!  For two years I've seen tons of other players do the same.  And ShakaAus, I can't believe you're whining about &quot;only&quot; making 25kpp off donations.  Now that is pathetic.  But for chanters to basically reserve this buff for the high end and uber twinks only is crap.  And to make good on your suggestion Shaka, I fully intend to start that chanter (I already have a copy of KEI that I WOULD have given to some lucky chanter when I gave away other 50+ drop spells the other night) and we'll see how chanters like competing with a free KEI in Nexus.  <br>
<br>
And the end of this, when chanters are so greedy that they won't even give a KEI out on a raid that they are a part of, there's a problem.  And yes, this happened to me recently on a Kith raid that I organized to help the chanter's buddy on.  No, I get told that she only casts KEI on people that can afford her 100pp charge.  And that was after a 56 cleric rezzed an entire Naggy raid for free, for those of you that want to cleric bash.  I don't think I've ever seen a cleric make 10kpp on rezzes in 3 hours, and if I did, I'd be the first to slap the greedy prick.  No one has EVER been as miserly and greedy as the enchanter community with a NO REAGENT spell!  Come on, you guys make up Shaka's 30kpp or even the EXTREMELY inflated 60kpp in a matter of days.  Sounds to me like you're doing much better than the rest of us who will NEVER make up the cost of our upper end spells.  For a group of people who's response to me is &quot;Quit whining...stand in line and take up the arse like the other casters&quot;  You seem to be making a point of whining about that price you paid for this spell that has you banking in the dough.  Guess what, there'll be another expansion eventually, Verant love that money just as much as you do, and don't be surprised to find yourself on the arse end of the class balancing stick.  God willing the rumors of a KEI nerf I keep hearing are true.  So suck it up while you can, but remember, every class get their 5 minutes of fame, and when it's over everyone still remembers whether you acted with honor and integrity, or how you acted to take advantage of others.  Personally, I don't care whether I have or don't have KEI, a cleric is always taken over a chanter because at the end of the day, we save lives.  And to those chanters out there that want to spend your time fleecing the populace because taking meager donations have only made you a meager 25 thousand platinum, enjoy it while it lasts.  But remember, every dog has his day, and that doesn't just apply to druids =).<br>

My point on the 25k was that I did not even make back what I spent on the spell.  And I am sorry to let you in on this little secret : Everquest is not a universal philanthropic experiment.  I appreciate your opinion, and even empathize as I myself have often wondered why we dont do more sharing.  But the fact is I want to see and do places like Vex Thal and Hall of Honor.  And the fact is to do these places you need gear that rocks and to get to the places that drops the no drop gear that rocks you need to buy gear that will let you live in those places.  Get off your high horse buddy, oh wait, you cannot afford one.  Ummmm get off your soapbox and go enjoy the game for what it is... a microcosim of the real world.  If you want to roleplay a social worker.. Super <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , every community needs one. Be a guide or some other help intensive, thank you based reward character.  I cannot believe you would fault a character for taking advantage of their abilities - I can only assume you are insane with jealously.<br>
<br>
As far as casting KEI on a raid, well maybe your server is just filled with enchanters tired of dealing with sniveling little gimme whiners like yourself.  I myself do free KEI's for CR's, and of course if 'I' am on the raid I KEI the whole raid.  I am sure we are missing part of the story when it comes to your mysterious unKEIing ench.  <br>
<br>
Also, 900 mana is a damn big chunk of the mana pool.  So if you come across an enchanter in the field and he doesnt throw KEI on you just cuz dont be suprised, enchanters need that mana to keep groups alive. <br>
<br>
As far as clerics being better - - - - well every class is needed, no doubt.  But I have been in plenty of higher end groups and often have no cleric.  Not that I dont think they are needed, not bashing clerics or any other class so dont go running with that thread or I will just delete my post.  I am just amazed that you have played the game this long and are still crying. <br>
<br>
Also, my point on the 25k was only that I planned on taking donations till I recovered my 34k.  But, so many people refused to donate after i had cast that i just gave up on it altogether.  I made my character from scratch, and dont owe anyone jack, so dont tell me how i am obligated to dump kei on you just because it is componentless.  Gotta go now i feel my blueberry waffles coming back up.<br>

Can you say &quot;situational ethics&quot;?  I knew you could.<br>
<br>
I'm a level 51 enchanter.  I'll be level 52 soon.  Eventually I'll hit 60.  When that happens, my guild / group / raid / friends will have KEI coming out their ears.  Strangers get in line and pony up.  Why?  Because I'm not part of a l33t uber-guild, and although I did manage to save 9k for my horse, 10k for my ODS, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>will</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> save the 30-40k I need for that spell on my own, I'm not about to eat that expense when I know the people selling that spell in bazaar obviously didn't need it for themselves.  They /randomed and skipped merrily off to gouge me and my fellow independent enchanters for it.<br>
<br>
So make your enchanter and PL him to 60 (as if I believe you actually will do this, then spend all your on-line time camped in Nexus instead of playing).  I just wonder how you're going to accomplish the same thing on servers that you don't have the backing to PL yourself, or hadn't you taken that into consideration?<br>

<br>
Speaking as one who plays on the Karana server,<br>
<br>
Do 60+ Enchanters sit in the Nexus/Bazaar and shout, &quot;Buffing KEI for 100pp&quot;?  Yes, I pretty much see it every time I pass through there.  What's so bad about that?  If you don't agree with the price, it's simple.  Just don't pay and get a KEI from someone else.  That person still has a right to charge whatever they want for buffing their KEI.<br>
<br>
I personally feel that being a KEI capable enchanter has been more of a pain-in-the-butt to my enjoyment of EQ then anything else so far in my two-and-a-half years of playing.  Why?  I really don't like beggars.  Forget begs for rezzes, begs for ports, begs for shaman buffs... if you are a KEI capable enchanter (who doesn't like to hide behind /anon /role) then you are going to get the most begs per day then any of these.  I've never asked for any pp when I give out my KEI even though I paid 80k for my KEI scroll.  Usually a few times a month I will go to places like LOIO, Oasis, or the Karanas and buff lowbies with KEI/shissar just because it puts a smile on my face to see how truly appreciative they are of it (it's usually the 50's and 60's crowd I dislike.. most expect KEI from me regardless of where I am or what I'm doing).<br>
<br>
So I can hardly imagine anyone thinking this KEI Enc is greedy.  Tired and frustrated?  Yes, you could say that.  Sometimes I just don't even reply to the seemingly non-stop begs for KEI.<br>
<br>
Anyway, maybe there are some &quot;greedy&quot; Encs out there.   But Damerr??  Just remember that there are still some old-school enchanters out there who did start out fighting rats and bats with a guild tattered robe and a little dagger, and have earned every piece of pp or loot they have in their possession.<br>
<br>
Oh one final note to all you people who do ask for KEI from an Enchanter.  Please don't be /anon or /roleplaying when you ask.  Maybe nobody else feels this way, but I just find it a great annoyance when someone is hiding their class and level (more then likely to avoid beggars) begs for me to buff them.<br>
<br>
Well, I'll stop rambling on and on now.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

I hate asking outright for 100p but 100p is MUCH more appreciated than the 15p that I sometimes get.  I NEVER turn anyone down for KEI if 15p is all they can afford.<br>
<br>
People will sometimes ask me how much is a donation.  I simply tell them whatever you can afford, don't break yourself but a donation is acceptable.  <br>
<br>
But one thing I will NOT do is sit in the Nexus/Bazaar or anywhere else and cast KEI for FREE!!!!!  I paid 30k for this spell and I intend on getting my money back for it.  I sell KEI when i'm in the Nexus/Bazaar at night right before I log off or in the middle of the day when I can't devote my attention to a group.  <br>
<br>
So you mister Damerr need to sit back and realize that you are stereotyping ALL enchanters and we really don't appreciate your gesture.<br>
<br>
Oh and the raid bit : I go on raids all the time with my guild.  Anyone not committed enough to go on a raid with THEIR guild just because they want to sit in the Nexus/Bazaar and sell KEI isn't worth being in that guild.   <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Laladini Asrai<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->61 Phantasmist</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqfaces.com/photos/lalabg.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=352903">Goddess Chanter of Valorguard</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ramoen>ramoen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#330000>(11/27/02 9:20:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A tale of Enchanter Greed...</span><hr size=1> I am in active raiding guild, so most of the time, i dont have time (or want to) sit in Nexus casting C3 etc. Even if i could make a fortune.<br>
<br>
However, if that is what some chanters want to do to earn money instead of farming some boring items, its fine with me. im just not that kind of player.<br>
<br>
However sometime after a raid, i just run to Nexus (or a newbie zone) and shout &quot;Free C3 for all&quot; or something like that, and normally end up casting on 80-90 people before i leave..guess people tell their friends to hurry there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Some people still try to donate, but i reject it all, because i got the spell for free from Guild, so i dont have to earn money to cover my initial investment or anything like that. (i understand fully that some people try to at least get enough money to cover spell cost)<br>
<br>
Of course other chanters in the zone sometimes send me mad tells because i ruin their market, but hey, i do it because i like to make people happy, and its my choice to spend my time doing it.<br>
<br>
Only thing i ask of my &quot;customers&quot; is that they need to respect that i do not cast C3 unless i am offering it to them, or are sitting in Nexus/bazaar etc.<br>
<br>
And they actually respect that..they dont send me lots of tells in the middle of raids etc, so i guess they do a /who all before sending the tell.<br>
<br>
The added bonus is ofcourse that i never have to pay for ports/rezzes/etc since people remember me, even looong time after i casted it on them.<br>
<br>
Sometimes i also run into the lvl 60 super-twink-with-2-days-played-time who demand C3 now, but most of the time i think people are friendly and really appreciate it.<br>
<br>
I dont do this because im rich, actually i only have a few kpp in bank <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
My favorite thing is casting on newbies who actually still wear cloth armor etc, and who dont even know the buff name.<br>
It so fun to get a tell after a few minutes from a player who is astonished by his mana regen or haste etc, and ask me if im a god or GM or so. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Then again some chanters think i spoil the newbie players, but /shrug<br>
<br>
Hmmmm i seem to be rambling, but just wanted to add that not all chanters are greedy, i know quite a few who act like me.<br>

this doesnt only apply to lowbie groups i saw full groups of highlevels getting their shot of kei and leave.<br>
<br>
hell with kei every mana class can get solo exp much better than in groups, a lowbie pally with kei? sup who need that dumb warrior, a lowbie wizzy with kei? sup who need that poor rog. u just destroy with free kei everything u standing for, fair levling for everyone and feel what it means to gain a level.<br>

I don't C3 for free except to friends, or groups that have a 59 and below enchanter with them.  I learned my lesson, C3 = Beggars start to annoy me.<br>
<br>
In terms of cost of the spell, don't compare it to res, compare it to BOA.  It's about the same mana.  Would most clerics sit in Nexxus and continually cast BOA for dots?  Doubt it, that sucks up mana that they will cause them to have to wait when they have a group.<br>
<br>
I will often trade C3 for other buffs, C3 for POTC and SOE to a druid or C3 for Symbol to Cleric or C3 for ModRod and Ring to Mage.  I start my day with those three trades if I am soloing.<br>

Then  trade window reopens with 6pp in it this time... suddenly a light comes on... I get it.... someone wants kei.  I cancle trade again THEN a get a tell, ?? , no text mind you.  I respond with &quot;?&quot; .  Finally the rude lazy  person  says  for kei.  I politely tell him no. I didn't go off on him about his rudeness or anything. Then he tells me I'm NOT a nice person. Well  you know I wanted to tell him  what and where he could put his pp but instead  stated that I did not buff for pay and that I'm sure there were others there in the Nexus that did. I REFUSE to be treated like a common street whore. Yes I have  the kei spell but it is mine to use as I see fit.<br>

<br>
As a 61 chanter who DOES sit in nexus asking for donations for KEI I will say this..<br>
<br>
First my enchanter was born in april 1999 took a long time to level him heck I stayed at 54 for 8 months cause I did not like the high end game at the time.<br>
<br>
One day i decided i wanted KEI and started leveling again. 2 months later I was 60.<br>
<br>
At level 57 I started saving for KEI scroll (60K at the time) and by time I hit 60 I had saved all of 22K (thats selling items I had looted etc) I was lucky enough to have a friend lend me 18K. I bought KEI for 40K. Sold more equip and casted KEI a bit, paid friend back 6 days later.<br>
<br>
Until I made all 40K back (borrowed and my own) I charged 100PP per cast. Didnt care if just one person or full group 100PP was what I FELT I needed for the time I spent there NOT getting XP or Loot. After the 40K was made i went to the typical donation only mode.. its funny to see a level 55 druid hand you 8PP and want KEI, same guy that with an alt I tested and would not port me for less then 15P.. should I say all druids are greedy bastards from this account? naa.. time is PP and the hassle of bothering someone else for something they normally would not be doing in the course of their day should be compensated. dont feel this way?  stay an hour later at work tommorow and tell your boss its free of charge <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ive missed out on alot of XP and loot to sit around accepting 2 gold to 100pp and all ranges in tween for KEI's<br>
<br>
Oh and I spent 12 AA to extend buff duration to 30% (45% when you add in my item) so we not talking bout 2.5 hour KEI here.. talking more like 3.62 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I stay in /role mode alot.. to avoid the beggars Cazroy speaks of.. and until you have walked a mile in enchanter shoes .. hehe <br>
<br>
Oh I also play 51 druid, 54 cleric, and many others .. so i know how much they get hassled at bad times too.. its nothing compared to the KEI machine people think we are <br>

I then do a count down for 10 mins and then /mgb on.. and cast c3.. and spam the zone with the normaly 60 to 200pp that showed up for it.. it cost me 1800 mana.. 10 mins of my time.. and my /mgb aa .. and 4 chanters make nada for 10 mins.. and all the ppl that wanted it for free got it.. if they could not show up in time then they can beg for it or pay there choice but i then go /afk sorry no c3 talk to somebody else just did mgb c3 .. sorry you missed it.. and then leave nexus till two or three days later i do the same thing when i see ppl charging for it.. but you know what if i get a donation im happy.. but if i see same person ask / beg for c3  the 3rd or 4th time with out paying for it.. its /r sorry bro cant do it... and then if they give me @#%$ .. its /ignore .... doing it for free to same person over and over and never getting a dontian gets old.. <br>
Yes a donation is something i think is freely given.. but rember if you want it free i have the free right to say no.. or if you want it pay for it.. its my spell deal with it...<br>

While some people may view those that sell C3 in the bazaar/nexus as trolls, like it or not, they provide a valuable service.  A service that cuts down the &quot;down time&quot; of all casting classes.  What do they sacrifice in return?  A night of exping, PLing, Questing, camping, or whatever they like.  Is it a huge cash cow for some?  YES.  Do they force people to pay for C3?  No, You cannot be forced to give anyone money in EQ (unless they have your password, but that is a totally different thread).  <br>
<br>
In summation, if you don't like paying for C3 then don't!!! No one will cry if you stop asking.  If you want to make a toon and give free C3's all day, by all means do so.  To all the enchanters in EQ who gave me C3 (whether for donation or not) I thank you.  50-100pp is definetly worth the downtime it saved me between quads.<br>
