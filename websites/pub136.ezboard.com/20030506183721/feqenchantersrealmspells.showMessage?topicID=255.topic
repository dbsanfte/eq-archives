<br>
<br>
Spell: Levianth Eyes - talk to Ofala Olan in Gunthak and she will <br>
ask your help if you follow the quest.<br>
<br>
If you say &quot; I will assist you &quot; she will give you a container <br>
that she wants you to put 2 items in to combine them and give it <br>
back to her. She asks for a mermaid scale and a mushroom stalk.<br>
<br>
Mermaid scale can be gotten by giving lotus pedals to a named <br>
mermade in the water. she may be killable for it but has about <br>
50000+hp, I went oom DDing her and only moved her HP 3/5 a bub. <br>
She is non agro you can beat on her and she will not respond to <br>
attacks or spells cast on her and is immune to charm.<br>
<br>
Mushroom stalk is not a mush room stalk it is in fact *Pungent <br>
Fluid* and looks like a whiteish vial. It can be obtained from the <br>
Mushrooms in the caves on the land I got mine in a dead end cave <br>
with 2 torches before a big room with no other exits, though other <br>
ones may drop it as well.<br>
<br>
Combine the 2 items in the container she gives you to get I think <br>
a swirling vial, give the vial back to her to recive the spell.<br>
<br>
I was able to solo everythings I needed to kill though I would <br>
sudgest some help because of all the trains. The spell is no drop <br>
and the quest NPC's will only respond to a chanter.<br>

You say ‘Hail, Ofla Olan’<br>
<br>
Ofala Olan says 'Salutations! It is nice to see one such as you in <br>
these parts; I do get lonely for some intelligent conversation <br>
around here once in awhile. The majority of the time however, I am <br>
much too preoccupied [researching]. There are so many interesting <br>
things to discover in a new area!'<br>
<br>
You say ‘What researching’<br>
<br>
Ofala Olan says 'Many things actually. The very land of this <br>
island has interesting peculiarities due to the foreign plant life <br>
and substances the pirates have introduced into the ecology. I <br>
have been working most specifically on deciphering what portions <br>
of the strange materials may hold magical properties that could be <br>
useful to our work as Enchanters. Why, just the other day I <br>
believe I was on the verge of a great breakthrough with some odd <br>
substances I had mixed together, unfortunately I was careless and <br>
did not seal the vial tightly enough. When I awoke the next <br>
morning the [specimen] had completely evaporated.'<br>
<br>
You say ‘What specimen’<br>
<br>
Ofala Olan says 'Among some of the substances I was experimenting <br>
with, I began to notice some peculiar attributes. I noticed some <br>
of the dark priests taking cuttings from certain mushrooms, and <br>
began experimenting with that first. I discovered that they could <br>
be boiled into a salve that had the most wondrous properties for <br>
the eyes! It will take me ages to get the [necessary <br>
components] back to pick up where I left off on that particular <br>
spell, not to mention the research that I am compiling for my <br>
[brother] to assist with his specialties. I have enough material <br>
here to keep me swamped for ages, those spells will just have to <br>
wait!'<br>
<br>
You say ‘Who is your brother’<br>
<br>
Ofala Olan says 'My brother is also an accomplished enchanter by <br>
the name of Stofo Olan. He has been hard at work in Erudin <br>
researching for his teacher Jeb Lumsed. He has a keen sense for <br>
the properties of stone and other such solid objects. For some <br>
time now he has been attempting to harness the power of stone for <br>
use in some form of mind control, that could be activated through <br>
a piece of jewelry. Entirely by accident, it seems that such a <br>
substance has been in use on this island for some time. It is very <br>
dangerous however, and as such most of my work has been based in <br>
theories tossed back and forth between he and I. Are you <br>
[interested] in this [strange rock] as well?'<br>
<br>
You say ‘I am interested in strange rock’<br>
<br>
Ofala Olan says 'What a small world! I have skill with gem setting <br>
as many of our kind do, although I am afraid my specialties lie <br>
more with other types of elements and power. There have been <br>
stories of miners down in the Torgiran Mines losing their wits or <br>
becoming near zombie like in their actions. I have a hunch that <br>
whatever is doing this is being harvested there. Take good care <br>
down there, I fear that the miners themselves may not be too <br>
friendly. Travel into the mines and bring me two chunks of <br>
whatever the ore is that they are gathering, be sure it is of the <br>
type that glows brightly. Most likely the miners will have a few <br>
samples, but their masters probably have a few as well. Bring <br>
these to me with an enchanted bar of gold and I can fashion a test <br>
ring from it. Be careful!'<br>
<br>
<br>
The ore you need is ‘Gleaming Zraxthil Ore’ (No Drop). This can be <br>
found in Torigran. I got 2 of these from Broken Skull guards <br>
although miners can drop this also.<br>
<br>
Return to Ofala and hand in 2 Ore and an enchanted Gold bar.<br>
<br>
Ofala Olan says 'What a small world! I have skill with gem setting <br>
as many of our kind do, although I am afraid my specialties lie <br>
more with other types of elements and power. There have been <br>
stories of miners down in the Torgiran Mines losing their wits or <br>
becoming near zombie like in their actions. I have a hunch that <br>

samples, but their masters probably have a few as well. Bring <br>
these to me with an enchanted bar of gold and I can fashion a test <br>
ring from it. Be careful!'<br>
<br>
You receive ‘A Dimley Glowing Ring’ and a ‘Note to Stofo’. <br>
<br>
Now head to Erudin and hand the ring and the note to Stofo.<br>
<br>
Stofo Olan scans the note quickly and gasps. Hardly glancing at <br>
you, he begins examining the ring, tearing through notes and books <br>
scattered about his dark room. As he pores over a scroll of <br>
parchment covered in strange texts his eyes light up, 'Yes, yes <br>
this is it! Ofala really found something quite remarkable in this <br>
one! Watch my friend.' The slim Erudite slips the ring onto his <br>
finger and the gem begins to throb, Stofo seems to draw the power <br>
into himself for a moment then carefully places the ring back onto <br>
his desk. He closes his eyes a moment then turns to you, the <br>
darkness in his eyes almost lends fear for a moment before he <br>
smiles. 'Thank you my friend, this stone is very dangerous, but I <br>
believe that I have accessed the powers within me through it. Take <br>
these words and use them well, perhaps the power shall work for <br>
you as well, and please tell my dear sister hello.'<br>
<br>
Receive Scroll ‘Scyrer’s Trespass’<br>
