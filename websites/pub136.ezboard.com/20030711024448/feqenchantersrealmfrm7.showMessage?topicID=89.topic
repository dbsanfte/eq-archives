To my understanding there are 4 guards with him and 1 wanderer nearby. Do I need to find someone who can take 6 HTs? Or is there some better way to do this?<br>

The monk had caught aggro too but managed to FD.  Then the monk somehow managed to pull the Impaler out of the crowd and pull him to the SS zone where I waiting to charm him.  I had him guard the mud puddle there near the zone while I zoned out to clear aggro.  When I zoned back in he was gone.  <br>

Cast charm and other mobs aggro on the pet, now cast AOE mezz and if it works out you can run in hand in gem and gate. Unfortunately for me AE bounced on 2 of the mobs so one stayed with pet and the other aggroed on me, while mezzing a wanderer added with another HT leaving me low and with AE mez getting getting close to fading and charm possible to break any time I decided to just high tail to the zone which with sow was easy enough if you watch the route to avoid addition HTs.<br>
<br>
Second time 56 just took the traditional approach of having a group Big Tank takes the HTs, charm pet and Impalar and have it help with fight, after all dead hand in and kill or evac to leave it up ofr another.<br>
<br>
I do believe the solo method was doable but 54 may have been a little low just have Rune, Shield, bezerker for HPs, MR up as not a good time to be caught by your own AE mez, stun after handin and gate. <p><P><select>

Might be harder these days to find someone who hasn't destroyed OT faction by hunting in HS or KC.  Fortunately, every time we hunted HS, the SK was playing his rogue... so the SK's record was pristine for Impaler pulling. =) <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

One enchanter gets rune V and inproved invis.  Other enchanter bind sights him.   First, pacify the wanderer.   Then, invis enchanter strolls into Tzilugs room, and turns to face guardians one after another, as other one pacifies them through his eyes.  When all 4 guardians pacified,  invis enchanter charms(use Boltrans, Allure wont do),  hands in.   He tried to pull off a gate but Tzilug et him first.  So other enchanter (me) invissed and dragged his corpse to PoK book.<br>
<br>
When we reversed roles, I was actually able to gate before getting et.   Was easy. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bregalad Alcarin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, High Elf Beguiler, Xev &lt;Legends of Westwood&gt;<br>

Did this solo at 54 as a High Elf 'chanter.  Had Rune up.  Cast Illusion Dark Elf on myself.  Cast Collaboration on nearest scorpiki.  No longer KOS.  Wandered down to the room where he is, with his four guards and wandering friend.  Pacified all five of his guards, didn't get any resists.  Walked over to him, charmed him, did the turn in.  Mez'd him, then gated out.<br>

Sweaty palms the whole time.  I was nervous.  Looking back on it, though, it was cake.

I was KoS to Venril Sather faction when I did this at level 58 or so.<br>
<br>
I went down invised and tried to Charm.  I was attacked before Charm was done casting and ate several HTs.  I ran away and the only Skorpis that followed was the Impaler.  I ran out and got healed by the waiting cleric I had on hand.<br>
<br>
I then mezzed and charmed the impaler.<br>
<br>
Basically Rune + Bedlam gave me enough to get through it.  Today, I would Arcane Rune and do it easily.<br>

I don't know why everyone is saying you have to use Boltran's to charm him. When I did this, I had been on a number of Hate raids trying to get the Essence of a Vampire. I'd saved a Wand of Allure (and had several friends holding more for me). That's what I used on Tzulig.

When u enter the Impalers room there is 3 mobs on the left and 2 on the right.<br>
They con green at 65, and Impaler light blue. Fine I think, no prob, but yes those HT are nasty!<br>

Died, so got a group together with cleric, pally, sk and druid and I. We cleared the room with no problems, charmed impaler who joined in the battle. Then afterwards did the turn in. He did not aggro after this. <br>
Then ported out.<br>
