<br>
I have over 60 levels of EQ experience if you tally all my characters up, and I have never seen a better cash producer per hour at levels below 25. Sure, you can get a group together and go to several other places in search of the ultimate &quot;phat lewt,&quot; but a few bad rolls of the magic die and your efforts have been laid to waste while my little chanter is merrily moving through the lands of Norath at the paid rate, certain rate, of AT LEAST 33pp per hour in search of the next Stein of Moggok I intend to sell! And if I really want to streamline the process my 26th Wizzy can gate to various parts of Norrath to get 2 of the 4 items needed for the quest!<br>
<br>
Anyway...that's my 2cp worth.....try a chanter, you'll never be sorry!<br>

<br>
You should be at LEAST level 12 and an enchanter/enchantress to do this quest. There is a way to do it using Minor Illusion and invisible but this is WAYYY too tricky and will likely result in you being dead before getting a mug.  I strongly recommend you wait to level 12 to do it for the first time (because 12 is where you get Dark Elf illusion). The reason is you must have an illusion capable of allowing you to sneak into Ogguk (or other places if you are an evil type) unmolested and with sufficient faction (for which you need Alliance) to return the required component to Clurg the Barkeep and get your Stein. The first time you do this you will be quaking in your boots. The second through 50th time, it will be old hat. I started doing these at level 12, and made well over 4000 pp doing mug runs and selling the Steins in North Freeport for 200 pp FIRM (not a penny less!) If you do it right, it takes about 3 to 4 hours without any help other than the occasional SoW and with the advent of Luclin (to use the Luclin Nexus Teleporting System) the time can be even shorter. If you have a druid friend who will do 6 ports for you, you can do the whole thing in 45 minutes.<br>
<br>
I have a regular routine for doing mug runs, 10 Kiola nuts in the bank, and as many honeycombs as I could buy or scrounge on a mule (believe it or not, getting honeycombs delayed me on more mug runs than anything else till I dived a merchant and got about 30 of them - too bad they don't stack). The basic path is:<br>
Prerequisites: <br>
1) Have a Flask of Nitrates (see below for where and how to get this item) from the last time you did the quest (the first time you will have to get that first - just get a port to Surefall, get the Flask of Nitrates and then gate back to Freeport). <br>
2) Bind in Freeport<br>
3) Have some Kiola Nuts (purchased from the Erollisi Elves in Ocean of Tears - first stop after the boat lands after leaving Freeport - buy 10 of them for a plat and a half each and Gate back to Freeport)<br>
<br>
1) Run to Rivervale and get Honey Jum (or get a port to Misty). Stop in Kith woods and kill Bixies for honeycombs if you need them (check merchants around Kith and Rivervale and Misty for player sold combs or buy from players). NOTE: ONLY run Kith Woods in the daytime (the undead come out at 8 PM and leave at 8 AM) unless you enjoy a high pucker factor. You can get Honey Jum from Kizzy Mintopp in Rivervale (use Halfling Illusion and alliance for faction). Costs you 3 pp and 3 honeycombs (she WILL take pp instead of 30 gold pieces). Get experience and Halfling faction and a Jar of (Lore) Honey Jum (this is NOT a no-drop item so another character can get it for you)<br>
<br>
2) Run to North Karanas Wizzie spires. Use Luclin Port to GFay. As an alternative, get a port or punt to GFay (much faster but costs pp). Once in GFay, run to AkAnon and give the Flask of Nitrates to Kimble Nogflop. Get Regurgatonic Lore, no-drop) (use gnome illusion and Alliance for faction) and experience and Gnome faction.<br>
<br>
3) Run back to GFay Wiz spires. Use Luclin teleporter to North Karanas. Once there run to West Karanas to the Barbarian Village. Use Barbarian Illusion (Human Illusion works at level 12 until you get Barbarian Illusion at 16) and Alliance to get indiff faction with Frostbite the dog. Give him Regurgatonic and get a Koalindl fish (LORE, No-Drop), experience and Barbarian faction. Then run to Surefall Glade. (Note: there IS another way to get Koalindl Fish but I consider it an exploit and won't do it - involves killing Koalindl fish in Queynos with a mule then logging the main back on to loot the corpse. The faction hit with this method on the mule is tremendous - so don't kill Koalindl's this way yourself)<br>
<br>
4) At Surefall Glade, use Woodelf illusion and alliance to talk to Gerael Woodone at the temple there. Say to him: &quot;I will deliver a flask&quot; You get Flask of Nitrates (Lore, No-Drop) used for your NEXT mug run. (Note: if you ported to Surefall from GFay/AkAnon, just reverse the order of steps 4 and 3).<br>
<br>
5) Run to South Queynos and catch  a boat to Erudin. Fish in the meantime for fun and profit, or cast spells while waiting to raise your skills.<br>
<br>
6) In Erudin, go to the bar called BlueHawk's Food and buy an Innoruk's Kiss of Death drink from the bartender there (5 sp and change). Take it to the Erudin Library, top floor, and, using Erudin Illusion and Alliance for faction, give the drink to Sinnkin Highbrow. Get Erud's tonic (LORE, No-Drop) (looks like a milk bottle), experience and some Erudite faction. Gate to Freeport.<br>
<br>
7) Go to East Freeport to the Seafarer's Roost Bar near the docks. Use Human Illusion and Alliance for Faction on the bartender Gregor there. You can hand him each item (Koalindl Fish, Erud Tonic, Honey Jum and Kiola Nut) one at a time (some people had reported problems if they didn't) or all at once (I never had problems handing in all 4 at once), but make sure you have at least indifferent faction, preferably amiable faction. Receive the Barkeep's Compendium (Lore, No-Drop), experience, faction and 1 to 4 pp.<br>
<br>
8 ) Get your SoW shoes on (or get a port to the Feerott) and run invisible from East Freeport to Just outside of Ogguk. This part is scary the first time thru as sometimes folks train undeads in Oasis near where you run through, and the Ogres are still not liking you at this point if youa re a goodie type. Outside of Ogguk, make sure you have invis, gate, alliance (or later Benevolence) and Dark Elf (or later Ogre) Illusion memmed. Cast Invis and make sure it holds...Hold your breath and run into the Ogguk Zone...Invis WILL hold through a zoning... as soon as you are in and the zone area is clear of Ogres, cast Illusion Dark Elf on yourself, then recast invis (if you go link dead, you will lose your illusion and die in Ogguk... very very bad. But Invis will still be there even if you go ld). Once invis is holding, follow the pathway to the bar. Stand next to Clurg the bartender, then cast Alliance on Clurg. Your invis will drop, but in DE Illusion makeup, you will be protected from being squished by the very nasty Ogres inthe bar. NOTE: The Bankers will STILL aggro you, so DON't go to the bank in Ogguk (unless you are a baddie).<br>
Clurg should be indifferent now...Hand him the Barkeep's compendium and pray...<br>
<br>
Tah-duh-da-da-duh-da-da! You get experience, Ogre faction and a brandy-new Stein of Moggok LORE, MAGIC, 10 INT, 5 DEX, 10 HP, 25 Save Disease, 3 charges of Light Healing AND it's a Light Source! Amazing gear! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Invis again, run out of the bar, find a safe place away from everyone and gate out to Freeport. DON'T gate from the bar. Your Invis will be gone as soon as you press the gate spell gem and if the gate collapses, your illusion may well depart and you will be Ogre toe-jam. Take the extra few seconds to run to a safe place first while invisible.<br>
<br>
9) Once in Freeport, sell your mug to a player for 200 pp, verify the prerequisites (Flask of Nitrates, Bind, Kiola nut) and start over with step 1 again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Simple huh? 3 to 4 hours without ports, 45 minutes with ports. I have done up to 3 in a day using a combination of ports and running.<br>
<br>
I managed to finance all my low level equipment purchases and save enough money to be able to get my Jewelcrafting to 188 (about 2000pp), then save up an additional 2500 pp to get me the rest of the way to 250 at level 39 by doing mug runs aloong with regular leveling. I never wanted for money once I started doing mug runs. And there is currently only one Race I am Ally with right now: Clurg and the Ogres love me - as a light skinned blonde haired goody-two-shoes High Elfette, I can run into Oggok any time I like now in my regular form <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  25 or so mug runs will do that for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It's a moneymaker as long as players keep on buying them for 200 pp each. well worth the time to do the runs, and you get to see the countryside <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Sunny Days and Cool Breezes,<br>
