I will post stats for Maddie when I get them up somewhere to link them here.<br>
<br>
She is right now a level 10 Enchantress I have parked in Paineel, hoping to take advantage of the xp boost in Warrens to level me up to something useful and maybe be able to do some of the neat quests I keep hearing about.<br>
<br>
Madalyn is not the High Elf's High Elf. Infact, her story gets her contempt from those who know it. She is a complex character. She can be at once very polite and formal, and next streetwise and hot-blooded. <br>
<br>
Madalyn's family are merchants. Her father ran an Inn once upon a time in the Commons that would serve as a rest stop for delegates. It won her family a great deal of respect and admiration, and certainly a name, Innsmith.<br>
<br>
Madalyn had little love for those of court. She found them to be two-faced and divisive more than not. She found commoners (humans no less) to often be much more honest, and she could appreciate that honesty. Her family would see naught of her associating in anything more than pleasantries with mere humans, so her clandestine associates won her a bit of respect.<br>
<br>
It also won her the admiration and love of a Highwayman, a lone rogue who plagued towns and bandits with equal impunity. He was a mysterious sort, known to none, save one. And that was Madalyn.<br>
<br>
Their &quot;unrequieted&quot; love would become legendary in thier hollow. That legend would become thier undoing. <br>
<br>
Now, one does not have to spend long in the Commons to know that the politics of the area are--peculiar and full of deceptions. <br>
<br>
It was true that the Highwayman had made no friends, neither among the city guardsman, nor among the bandits. And quite true as an aside, he made no friend of the Militia either. But of all of them, only the Paladins would not hunt him actively, for he had proven himself no friend of thier hated enemy. And so it was, that when the bandits of the commons had had enough of the Highwayman taking down thier camps that they turned to the Militia. The Militia did not wish to be made fools of again by the Highwayman, for he was able to spin circles about them and toss them off his trail with ease.<br>
<br>
Then they hatched an idea. The Paladins had been quite the thorn in their side, and had managed to aquire a particular helm. Now, this helm was more special than most in possession of the Paladins, for this helm allowed them to spy into certain activities of the Militia, notably of the highly-placed guardsman from whom it was taken as a trophy of his defeat. The Militia needed this guardsman, but they also needed that helm.<br>
<br>
But if they could circulate a tale to tempt the Highwayman, he would steal the helm, gain the Paladin's ire, for the Paladins would surely think that it was stolen for the Militia, and the Paladins would chase after him in numbers.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse, to be sure, the bandits would lie in wait about the Commons when the hunt was called, and the Militia would set themselves to hunting, to find the thief before the Paladins could reaquire the loot.<br>
<br>
The plan set, the Militia dispensed the rumors among the commoners loyal to them and prepared themselves.<br>
<br>
True enough, the Highwayman could not resist the prize, dispite Madalyn's misgivings. But, that last fateful night he promised that he would return to her by the dawn with prize in hand. With such a valuable prize, they could take off together to make thier own way about the world.<br>
<br>
Now, the Militia would prove most lucky in this, for among the Innsmith's servants they had won the loyalty of a servant. Now, the servant meant well for Madalyn, and told the Militia the conversation that had transpired. And so it was, that the Paladins had kept on our hero so that he could not return when he expected. And Madalyn would behold later in the day not her love's triumphant arrival, but the Militia marching.<br>
<br>
They knew that if they took Madalyn prisoner that the Highwayman would speed to the rescue. So, with a great show of &quot;catching the thief&quot;, making it known that Madalyn was the Highwayman, they took her prisoner.<br>
<br>
True enough, the Highwayman did indeed come to rescue her, though not in the manner they had expected. For, they never knew HOW he was able to allude them, and with the Helm, he was able to keep watch on a number of the Militia. So, he stole away with her.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the Paladins did have better ways of watching him and caught them as the attempted to make thier escape. This alerted the Militia, and there was fighting all around. <br>
<br>
That night the Highwayman would die. All would know that Madalyn was not the thief herself, but her family was shamed none-the-less, and decided they would send her off. They meant for her to learn from the Clerics, but like her love, Madalyn was a devote of Karanas.<br>
<br>
She instead inlisted herself into the Enchanter's Guild to learn from them.<br>
<br>
And thus is her story.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Her story is an adaptation of another tale, very sad and very beautiful, made known to me is a song. You will find it below.<br>

It's a very good story, and fits well with the tale.  Do you by chance have other stories that you've written?  If so I would love to read them as well.<br>
