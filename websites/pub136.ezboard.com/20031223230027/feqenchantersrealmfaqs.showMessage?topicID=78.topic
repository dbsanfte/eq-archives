<br>
EQTraders has much better information on this quest than does Allakhazam's which is generally a bit off on trivials.<br>
<br>
First and Second Shawl were cake....<br>
<br>
Third Shawl had trouble finding the infamous Snow Griffins without a tracker. But overcame. Baking is easy.  Fishrolls can be made with items found in PoK, so its cake to level baking.<br>
<br>
4th Shawl was even easier. Pottery is cake to level 122. Trick to finding the guy is to take a friend that can pet guard here near the spot. Pet will look at closest NPC....easy as pie.  I highly recommend Pottery of 122 for all characters as one can make Thurgadin Gate Potions (No Drop but handy).<br>
<br>
5th Shawl Easy Tailoring. Dang Bile wurms. They were a pain in the buttocks and easier to see outside at night with night vision off. I did the threads in Upper Spiders Camp in Velk (they drop a lot more there).  At 65 the camp is soloable.  I was able to use my Animation, with NDT and SoV against all mobs.  Against named mobs, Uproar was required.  The 62nd level pet regen + lifetap from NDT is enough to generally heal the pet.  <br>
<br>
6th shawl Maximum Tailoring. Getting tougher now on skillups. I got Wu's all the way to the max and tried the combine with a geerlok. Succeeded first time, so this one was cake for me.  Mobs for this were easy to solo.<br>
<br>
7th shawl....aka the frikkin nightmare.  Any one of 5 combines could send you back to the start.  Given that any combine can fail 5% of the time (even when trivial) its nervewracking.<br>
<br>
Ok Pottery.  I made poison vials. Problem is that you need skins. Ok, zombies are actually most prevelant in Gunthak on the beach. Pelts are most prevelant in JP Forest (faction hit), in JP they never drop ruined pelts.<br>
<br>
Fletching is simple. Just go to a vendor buy stuff, do skillups, sell stuff. I did mine in FV. It was very quiet.<br>
<br>
Brewing is simple if you can forage. However, I made Vodka with Vegetables I bought in the bazaar. Then from those I made Brain Bites. Not too bad.<br>
<br>
Jewelcraft. I saved a LOT of gems over time. So, its a lot like fletching (you do not need to enchant the metals for skillups) except more expensive.<br>
<br>
Back to Tailoring. Couple of other notes. The Spiders in EK were camped every time I tried to get there. So, I killed Drachnids in FV. Not as fast, but dropped more money. That is how I got the rest of my silks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Onto the 8th.<br>
<br>
Jewelcraft. I did all my skillups in the 7th shawl.<br>
<br>
Smithing. What a pain in the buttoks! I think this costs more than Jewelcraft. So, up to banded is not a problem. I decided to see if I could make Seafarers Ringmail to get me up before I jumped to Plate. I fished stacks of Saltwater Seaweed for the temper. Then, I looks for Mugs of Sea Foam. Found they drop from the Evercamped Sea Fury Cyclops. Sheesh. So, I switched to Ornate Chain and got to 155. That was moderately expensive. For Leather padding, I used a lot of Low Quality Rockhopper Hides (from Marus Seru) and Spiderling silks from the Feerott. Spiderlings are very abundant near the druid ring. I never saw a guard there, and I was amiable in Ogre form anyway.<br>
<br>
Farming the gems I could solo as well.  Best place to farm them is near the center (north entrance to the Geonid caves) entrance to the Geonid caves.  There are 2 Geonids standing by a rock.  There are 3 Geonids that are off three different branches of tunnels (1 is out of view of the rock).   There is a safe spot between the Rock and the out of view Geonid.  I pacified and then pulled from the rock and then in what will seem a normal order (rock out of sequence to break spawn).  Got about 1 - 2 drops/hour.<br>
<br>
To get Velium Hound Furs, its helpful to be allied to CoV as I am and have a tracker (which I have a friend).  Soloable but hard to find.<br>
<br>
Most of my Velium drops I got in Velks while I was farming Silk Threads.<br>
<br>
8th shawl is much less scary than the 7th.  No failed combine will send you back to the start of the 8th.<br>
<br>
Ok, we did my war with 2 groups (some of which were alts being 2 boxed).  I LDed between wave 3 and wave 4.  General went into a pace back and forth mode.  Could not Memblur him out of it.  Had to Aggro him a ways away and then memblur him out of it (took several attempts).  He no longer stops at the two gnomes on the Ice as he used to get stuck there and we would have to aggro him from being stuck.<br>
<br>
Couple of final notes.<br>
<br>
1st Thing.  I did most of my skillup work in Freeport.  Its empty on my server so its a lot easier to find whatever you need (Forge, Pottery Wheel, Kiln, Brew Barrel) unused.  Its easier in PoK in many ways, but crowded.<br>
<br>
2nd thing.  I bought a lot of geerloks.  They are very cheap compared to the cost to do the combines.  I highly recommend them.<br>
<br>
3rd thing.  I started in earnest, pushing about 6 weeks ago.  Now for the first 3 weeks of this, it was very much an on and off thing.  The latter 3 weeks was basically full time.<br>
<br>
In summary, would I do it again?  Not anytime soon.  Its a lot of work.  My suggestion is to spread it out over levels.  We all get bored with whatever we are doing after awhile.  So, use the next shawl as a break from whatever you are doing.  I switched out my Pauldrons of Witness for the 7th Shawl and wore none of the ones before that.  The 8th Shawl is a very nice item.  As you can see from my Magelo, I am a reasonably equipped Velious era character (yes I know there have been 2 expansions since then).  The Prayer Shawl is the last major upgrade outside of NToV or PoM until we go to Ssra and VT.<br>

Before even starting shawls, I had 193 brewing, 195 jewelcraft, 150 smithing, 91 tailoring and 78 pottery.  Also, 151 fishing. You could say I dabbled in skills.   I actually work actively on smithing now, it's up to 184, and the first skill I plan to GM.  1750 club and completion of Grimel quest is one of my long standing goals.<br>
<br>
Shawls 1 and 2: set up shop in front of giant fort in GD and just slaughtered non-stop.   Collected 4 toes and 10 heads in about 2 hours.   I foolishly did not think to save a beard, and accasional did not even check wolves I killed.<br>
<br>
Shawl 3: baking to 130 on fish roll. (I will NEVER eat iron rations again!!!).   I also got a lot of frost giant meat which got me to 142, and a visit to Akheva yielded lots of Centi meat, toes,  and mind worm meat with which I got to 154.   Mind worm steaks are the best, but meat hard to get solo.<br>
A whole evening spent running around EW finally yielded everything short of 3 griffin eggs.  Those I got the next day with help of a guildie druid.   We hunted near ST entrance, griiffs seem to be very common there.   Succeeded on all combines first time.<br>
<br>
Shawl 4: made medium bowls to 122, large to 148.   I hunted zombies near Gukta - there are TONS of them.   Made lined vials to 155.   Also, spent some time in Crystal Caves, getting the velium, but mostly farming spiders.   Crystal spider silk is an easy way to 131.   Crystal caves is awesome for farming velium cause it has banker, shop and forges right in zone, and I was able to convert velium blicks to sheets and large bricks to rings.  Small bricks, aside from what I needed, went to bazaar.  Once I had my vial made, went to EW and started visiting the spots advised by EQTC.   The second loc up popped the dorf.<br>
<br>
Shawl 5: the MOST pain.   And had to do it twice, cause first time I failed on final combine.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I hunted extensively in and out of caves.   Wurms in caves dropped no biles, but I got a lot of cash and gems.   Threads - camped top shelf in Velks.  Grouped, solo, I would allow other group take the camp - I provided buffs/slows/CC, and they left all threads for me to loot.<br>
<br>
Shawl 6: a breeze. 40 min in GD mass murdering wolves/giants at the spires.  20 min in EW looking for manticores.   Got a port to CS and went to sirens at the SS entry point.   There are 8 sirens at that camp, you just need to know where.   Took two clearings to get 2 hairs.  I had 150 tailoring by then from doing Wu, so I equipped my geerlok, crossed fingers, and succeeded both combines.<br>
<br>
Shawl 7: First, holed up at PoK fletching vendor, and 300pp and about 2 hours later emerged with 180 fletching.  I took easy way out, buying the shell(400), molkor hide(30) and ulthork tusk(60).   We did Iceshard manor some, got no blood, but a friend shaman turned out to have a spare blood.   She were intending to sell it to add to her Torpor fund, but that was made unnecessary by the fact that couple days prior I handed her a freshly researched Torpor scroll. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Generosity works both ways!   Then, me and 2 guildies (SK and druid) headed to SG, and got tooth off the first fish we killed.   I breezed through combines without a single fail.<br>
<br>
Shawl 8: I already had enough velium sheets and rings stashed from my previuos hunts in CC.  By the way, I brew my own Velium tempers.   That way they come out ~10pp each.   The 15pp difference from vendor-bought adds up to a LOT when you have people in guild going for cultural armor.   I again took easy way out, and just bought the hound fur at 300 each.  Succeeded 8 paddings from 9 combines, and then had 8 on 8 success making the armor.  As we speak, I am camped in WL in geonid cave.   So far, have breastplate and vambraces imbued.   I am also contemplating weather I should go for Phenocryst focus while my faction is still good (high indifferent with Collaboration)<br>
I hope to get my shawl by end of next week. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bregalad Alcarin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, High Elf Phantasmist, Xev &lt;Legends of Westwood&gt;<br>

One other important thing.  The General wandering back and forth seemed to have nothing to do with my LD.  We did another Shawl Walk last night for a druid and the same thing happened in the same spots.<br>
<br>
Spot 1 - Just before the fight at ToFS.<br>
<br>
Spot 2 - On the island, just before the gnome camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
Solution, pull general toward the right direction then memblur.  Several attempts may be needed.<br>
