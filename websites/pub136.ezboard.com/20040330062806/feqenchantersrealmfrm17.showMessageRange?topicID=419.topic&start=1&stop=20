<br>
I hope this certain enchanters views, trouble you as much as they trouble me.  I for one being an enchanter am embarrased at this persons views, and am forwarding his comments to VI with my recommendation that maybe they re-evaluate our spells/abilities, since if we can outdamage 5 of another class solo, then we are overpowered, and WE KNOW IT.<br>
<br>
We wouldn't like it if clerics could outdamage us, why should we be allowed to outdamage entire groups (even if it's a melee heavy group).  Then to make fun of a class that lost their solo ability and has had more difficulty getting into groups than we have ever had, it's not about us, it's about the integrity of the game and consistancy (as one mage put it).<br>

You want us nerfed? Obviously you dont understand the top end game (I mean Tier 3 and higher in POP).

<br>
And about damage? Mage charming pet makes way more than chanter charming pet. But it doesnt matter, I dont care as all claases has strong points.<br>
<br>
About AAs. Necro soloing in CoD makes AA per 5 or 10 minute. Well I dont care that too. Necro has allways been strong solo class. <br>

And I have no idea what other charmers like druids can achieve as they dont whine to nerf themself.<br>

I was about to quit playing chanter before POP come out as for last 3 expansions we have been hit nerf, after nerf so much that my enjoyment of being buffing guy without any other benefit to raids was only that I could do in Sshra or some other zones. Now at least we can play our class as it was intended, charm pet, make it benefit the raid and develope your PLAYING skills to survive when pet is released.<br>

Tier 3 PoP mini's soloable by an enchanter, no I understand that &quot;top end game&quot;, I don't understand how there can be those that &quot;think&quot; it's balanced when I can solo (as an enchanter) things that are not meant to be so &quot;trivial&quot;.  Clearly the insane dps of PoP mobs allows us way too much power.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> And about damage? Mage charming pet makes way more than chanter charming pet. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Mages charm has a lower mob lvl cap, lower mob lvl = lower ac/atk vs higher leveled mobs.  1 PoP zone has &quot;mage charmable&quot; elementals in ready access to mobs worth killing (for xp/aa/loot).  Mages also have a higher resist rate and lower duration on their charm, their only CC vs ele's is a mez that we would LAUGH at.  <br>
<br>
I won't deny that in the 1 zone that it's efficient for a mage to charm solo it can be quite profitable (aa/xp/loot), but what about the clerics, sk's, palys, wizzards, shamen, rogues?  How well can they even do their jobs in a group when &quot;we&quot; are out solo'ing mini's?  Why are we being so selfish?<br>

<br>
I don't play a necro, I won't speak of them, but from my memory they were given some nice utility to help them solo since they had no real group role (back around kunark or vel).  We do however have a huge role in a group, huge enough that people can't really put a group together (in PoP) unless they have us, shammie, bard, or worst case BL.  To top that off, we get to solo above that of other classes who have no &quot;real&quot; group role?  Again selfish.<br>
<br>

Every druid I see should beg for root/snare to be nerfed so that they quit rooting/snaring themselves.  Again the druids charmable mobs are lower level than ours, making our DPS &gt; theirs.  Again why the greed? (yes I do have a 65 drood as well and the xp/aa/time doesn't come close, but most druids are too busy rooting themselves to understand how to use their tools.  They laugh at their 10 minute animal charm that they had at 34, saying it was worthless, if that gives you a clue as to how clueless they can be.<br>

Hmmm buff whore, kk thnks bubye, try playing any other class, they all can be just as boring in certain situations, and I sure bet you &quot;thought&quot; that mage loved to be a trod whore, and ohh how those clerics &quot;loved&quot; those CH rotations, I bet those melee &quot;loved&quot; standing there with their auto attack on and hitting taunt every minute or so, and those wizzards who got to push nuke, wait, nuke, wait, nuke, wait, I bet they &quot;loved&quot; that too.  Perhaps you need to open your eyes a little and look through the eyes of other classes a bit, I mean those poor melee have the most boring job of all /attack /afk, come back in a minute to hit taunt, go get a beer, come back oops got to move a wee little bit, hit taunt.<br>

When did I post this in The Druids Grove? &quot;play our class as it was intended&quot; ????  We were intended to be overpowered??  OMFG and I thought SoE had talked about class balancing, ohhh no balancing has no meaning to you.  <br>

Consistancy and Balance are the question<br>
<br>
Who is going to be consistant?  We complained many times when we took a power hit, now we get a form of /godmode, and we don't see the imbalance?  That is not consistant.  <br>
<br>
I do hope you see your lack of knowledge about other classes as a huge pile of missinformation you &quot;tried&quot; to use to justify &quot;us&quot; being able to solo mini's.

How about we nerf all classes that can solo in PoP.  That would make everyone even right?  Hell, lets really hit the Wizzy's, chanters, and bards since they've been AE'ing in Seb for how long now?  While were at it, lets nerf clerics so that druids and shammys are balanced with them.  Don't want one class able to heal better than another ya know, gotta keep if fair.  Necro's and druids must be nerfed too because they have always been strong soloers.  Rouges and monks have insane DPS so we gotta cut them back.  Not to mention FD gives a monk the ability to escape a situation that would be certain death for another class, better take that away to keep things fair.  Want me to keep going?<br>
<br>
Now lets take a look at this from another angle.  The &quot;What this class is designed to do&quot; angle.  Clerics = Heal and buffs,  Wizards = direct damage, ports,  Necro = dots and mana twitching,  Chanters =  Mezz/charm/buffs ,  blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
Basically what I'm getting at is each class has it's own strengths and weaknesses.  One of our biggest strengths is CHARM and you wanna take that ability away from us?  Thats like Nerfing necros so they can't solo, or druids, or bards.  Hell any class that can solo.  Charm soloing is actually pretty risky when you think about it since we hold up to mobs beating on us about as good as butter stands up to a hot knife.  At lvl 58 I have just over 1700hp.  1700 divided by 250 comes out to roughly 7 hits and a nekkid chanter looking for a rezz.  Charm can save your butt on a raid or in an exp group.  It's one of our biggest assets and you want to nerf it, thats like nerfing Cheal for clerics man.  All because one of our strengths allows us to solo really well.  SO WHAT!  I'd like to be able to sow myself, I want to be able to heal myself, I want to be able to port to all druid/wiz location including hate and air, I'd also like to have the DD spells of a wiz and manaburn,  plus the killer dots of a necro and some better AC/hp buffs would be nice, maybe Virtue and symbol.  But just because &quot;I&quot; don't have them I'm not gonna advise VI to nerf the other classes so were &quot;balanced&quot;.<br>

If charm (and looks like the nerf is in test server again) is nerfed, I am usre you will be happy to go back the old ways when we sit 12 hours in VT buffing when needed and doing whatever you feel like spending time when buffs are not needed. Or same happened in NToV clearing also. Now they give us a tool in POP tier 3 and higher to really help with damage and do buffing as well as mezzing, YES it is too powerfull to chanters, make them back to sit and meditate, what they can best.<br>
<br>
So if some chanters can solo POP miniboss, CHANGE the encounter, not nerf whole class. (If that was intended and chanter was not suppose to solo him but mage was...).<br>

Elemental fully mage self buffed gives higher DPS than chanter pet self buffed. And even it is same or even lower, they have DAMAGE spells to compensate, compared to our where all hybrids (including clerics) can crit higher damage.<br>
<br>
Our only real damage in POP is charming, yes take it away...<br>
<br>
You say Necro getting AA per 10 minutes is ok, mage getting AA per 15 minutes is ok but chanter getting AA per 30-35 minutes (that it takes for me to do in over time) is overpowered?Hmmm, interesting. And You dont wanna know what Bards, Wizards and Druids can do in POP...<br>
<br>
&quot;Every druid I see should beg for root/snare to be nerfed so that they quit rooting/snaring themselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
I dont see the point here? If they snare or root themself, is it nerf if it is supposed to be fixed or is it their bad playing if they keep doing it non stop? Irrelevant here.<br>
<br>
Rotations has a lot to do Cleric playing game and it is DOING something, not waiting to buf someone. If you say playing your class and sitting and doing nothing is same, well then you can call every class boring. I call charming a pet and keeping it charmed, adding damage in boss fights needs skill and is something that chanters can proudly do when they are competent enough. Instead lay back and look what happens after initial prefight buffing is done.<br>
<br>
Overpowered is relative question debated so often in many boards I dont go to that anymore. I just say that giving chanters real playing in POP made game 10 times more interesting to me instead of last 4 expansions where we were nerfed someway in every expansion. We are casters but we lack the damage from all casters and fall behind all hybrids. Ok we are pet class but I wouldnt send my best pet againt cleric pet (which i can in PvP server) as I am not sure which will win and make me look pretty pathetic. Our pet doesnt last 5 second against anything in POP. Direcharmed pet doesnt last any longer = nerfed. Now nerf charm and we have , ummm Insanity 1100 nuke with long recast (thanks to wizards) and higher mana cost (thats other asters). I see daily Druids, Clerics and whatever NON CASTER classes over damage me with spells. <br>
<br>
Only damage we have in POP is charming, that is risky, not riskfree as you make it sound, and yes take it away!<br>
<br>
/whine off<br>
<br>
I am done with this &quot;enchanter&quot;. Asking to nerf your class makes me just ask you to make class you actually want to play as they are meant if you think chanter should not charm (except green stuff)...<br>

That’s uncalled for, your attempting to shoot me down with pathetic examples, in a failed attempt to get your point across (your point being: I should have /godmode on because I am an enchanter kk thnks gimmie CH and 150% rez's).<br>
<br>
Clerics=heals+hp buffs<br>
drools=ulility+ac buffs+dot's (they didn't need the 75% CH, they got it do to obsessive whining)<br>
Shaman=stat buffs+healing<br>
<br>
Grow up, your argument was the same as saying wizzy=chanter=necro=mage when it is clear we don't.  Go get informed then argue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Necro's and druids must be nerfed too because they have always been strong soloers. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

They have nearly no real role in a group, that’s why they were given their utilities that make them good solo'ers.  Then VI screwed up and gave drools GimpCH.<br>

<br>
Again, take the rogue out of that group and watch his &quot;Insane DPS&quot; dwindle, yet take us out of a group and our DPS can out damage an entire group. Again misinformed.<br>
<br>
I think your forgetting that SK's and Necro's have FD as a spells, so it's not exclusive to monks.  If you ever played a monk past 35 you &quot;might&quot; have grasped the concept that FD is balanced vs 35+ mobs, before that, sure it &quot;could&quot; be considered overpowering but that’s if you have impeccable timing.  For those mobs 35+, a monk learns quickly that FD is not a get out of jail free card, hence Pop-n-Drop goto monklybusiness sometime and read up on them.<br>

Ask a necro how they feel about twitching, they were relieved when trods came into being, it FINALLY freed them.  Then when trods got pulled down to balance Necro’s went into hiding for fear of returning to twitch beeches.  Ask a Necro about twitching, as a mage about trods, 80% of the mages will admit that trods were overpowered before they finally got changed, Necro’s will just display their disgust for twitching.<br>

I’d go more along the lines of CC and buffs.  Charm was fine as it was up until CoD, even those AA’s you spent in DC have been made practically worthless due to this one spell.  If you can’t see where CoD is overpowered, then I can’t help you, if you think it’s ok for 1 class to out damage entire groups then I can’t help you, but you’d probably be happier playing Doom where you can turn godmode on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Basically what I'm getting at is each class has it's own strengths and weaknesses. One of our biggest strengths is CHARM and you wanna take that ability away from us? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No, just tone CoD down to be inline with other class’ abilities.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Charm soloing is actually pretty risky when you think about it since we hold up to mobs beating on us about as good as butter stands up to a hot knife.

<br>
At 58, you don’t understand how overpowered CoD is, it’s not like the other charms.  I have seen chanters let their rez timers tick down to nothing because continuing to charm kill with CoD they’d get more xp faster than it would take them to med back up to FM after a rez.  Basically, they could get all their xp back, plus MORE by continuing to CoD, than they would get if they got a rez right away and had to meditate.  With CoD in tier 3 PoP zones, rez isn’t an option, it’s a waste of time.  That is proof enough that it’s overpowering.<br>

But just because &quot;I&quot; don't have them I'm not gonna advise VI to nerf the other classes so were &quot;balanced&quot;. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Suggestion, make a druid then goto druids grove and you’ll fit right in.  Seriously though if you had ever used CoD, you’d probably be singing a different tune.  The other charms prior to CoD are perfectly fine, it’s ONLY CoD that’s wayyyy overpowered, again something I can’t help you see unless you were of level to use it.<br>

<br>
1 spell, just CoD, all other charms are/were fine in relation to risk-vs-reward.  Using CoD, I had basically no risk, and the reward was so great that I could die every 15 minutes, and still make awesome xp, without getting rez’s.<br>

Not the entire lineup, just CoD.  No the mini’s I am referring to would be a full group, of end game equipped people, or 2 full groups of heavily equipped people.  Not mage doable by far, and shouldn’t be chanter soloable.  The guys I am talking about would basically be the equivalent of taking Tunare out in 3-4 minutes solo (which is by no means meant to say tunare is that hard/easy).  CoD, works on some pretty hefty stuff.<br>

<br>
I don’t know the Necro’s rates of aa gain in PoP, but I doubt it’s 10 minutes.  Mages have 1 zone where they can charm a descent mob in PoP to mass aa with, by no means even coming close to the rate we can get (they can only charm a 62 ele, we can charm a 64 anything, you do the math).  Wizards take 10-15 minutes per kill/kite hardly mass aa’ing, druids are too busy rooting themselves to even worry about.<br>

I can agree with you on that, unfortunately.  Though I try not to ask balance questions of things I don’t know first hand about, and my cleric isn’t high enough to have that, and won’t be for a long time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I see daily Druids, Clerics and whatever NON CASTER classes over damage me with spells. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again I agree here, but VI’s negligence to our nuke abilities does not justify our insane dps with CoD’ed pets.  With a CoD pet, it’s really a waste of mana to nuke (unless your LoM and are planning on dieing soon anyway to get fm, which is more beneficial than meding when your CoD charm/killing).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Only damage we have in POP is charming, that is risky, not risk free as you make it sound, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Dieing is not all that bad when CoD charm/killing, I was able to die every 15 minutes and be 1 aa ahead and have all my xp back before I’d die again.  That negates the risk, when the loss of life has no bearing, and trying to get a rez is easily considered a waste of time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I am done with this &quot;enchanter&quot;. Asking to nerf your class makes me just ask you to make class you actually want to play as they are meant if you think chanter should not charm (except green stuff)...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When I can charm to get over 800dps solo, something is wrong.  Mages “thought” they were awesomely powerful with the 200 sustained dps they could get in ideal situations (meaning full group + right clickies + horse + KeI), wizards haven’t /log’ed much more than 250 DPS but even at that, it wasn’t truly sustained as they did have to meditate 10-15 minutes here and there dropping their true sustained dps to 150ish.  Round and round, in PoP the DPS for the best-equipped max’ed AA characters is around 200dps.  1 Chanter with CoD alone can easily have 800+ dps sustained nearly indefinitely.  This just needs toned down to be more inline with other classes.<br>
<br>
At least theres 2 other enchanter out there that care enough to post, even if they don't share the same viewpoint as me, they at least care enough to voice their take.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately VI, will probably listen to the posts on CR's board which is extremely discouraging, since CR can't even get information correct and their ench board is the most heavily visited.<br>

have &quot;YOU&quot; actually done this and have /log to prove this?  do &quot;YOU&quot; have ANY idea how hard &quot;keeping&quot; a hasted level 63 charmed pet is?  you &quot;hear&quot; the rumors of some uber enc doing mini's and you assume that they are doing none-stop mini pulls...  To those who actually have done this, my hats off to you because you have more balls/skill then me keeping a charmed, 700+ hitting, hasted pet long enough to kill a mini.  For those who have only &quot;heard of&quot; these people, truth is, just like any &quot;amazing&quot; solo story you &quot;hear about&quot;, it's a 1 time event where lots of prep went into it and it's not &quot;sustainable&quot;.  Yes you can sustain 800 dps (till charm breaks unexpectedly and you are &quot;loading please wait&quot;)  whats your DPS when you wipe a raid cuz your &quot;hasted pet&quot; killed the MT after it broke charm?  better yet, your &quot;hasted pet&quot; killed the clerics of the raid?  how long do you REALLY think sustaining 800 dps is possible?  how much FT do you have?  FT 100? I got news for you FT is only stackable up to FT 15.  I sure is hell dont have enough mana at level 65 to keep a pet charmed for an &quot;nearly indefinitely&quot; period of time even if I wanted to and if the charm is &quot;fixed duration&quot;.  charme is &quot;balanced&quot; by the fact that it's expensive to cast and there is always a chance of it killing you and everyone dumb enough to be around you when you use it.  so... with all that said, go back and keep smoking that crack you been smoking and maybe your brain would rot to a point that you forget how to get back to this site to bug us real enchanters who arent idiots that talk about shiat that we have absolutly no idea about.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deeloss>DeeLoss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#330000>(1/18/03 2:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A question of balance</span><hr size=1> My thoughs on this...<br>

<br>
is CoD over powered.. in the right zone and beeing used bye 1% of the enchatners on a sever that are Uber equpted .. yes i would say it is.. but to the other 99% .. i think the risk / reward is worth the exp we can get if they think its worth it.. but i know for one thing even with the nurfs on test .. the 1% of chanters will still be able to solo and still get good exp.. so nurfing it dont hurt them just slow them down.. so who are you screwing the other 99% who try to use it.. thanks VI... <br>

<br>
sustained means what to you? for 5 mins? 10 mins? forever?<br>
if you die your dps isnt sustained while you CR. are you saying that ench get about 1600 dps? that would be a lie.<br>
<br>
Nerf ench? how about this, you know what spell makes more enchanters bored than any other? KEI. Its way over powered and reduced our usefulness through out luclin. I didn't see you crying then. You were probly playing your port whore druid back then. Oh yeah dont forget KEI's 30+k price tag. You must have bought that with all the cash you made from enchanter needing ports.<br>
<br>
You do not charm very much, i can tell, because mobs that quad 700's eat ench up very fast. and if you have ever charmed seriously you would have the 2-6 back to back  under 30 sec breaks in your charm, yes CoD is BA for higher lvls, and BA does this a lot. <br>
<br>
Teir 3, I'd say about 3-4 guilds on each server can even get to tier 3 zones. So lets say 5 active ench in each guild 20 ench MAX can be in those zones, how many of them you think can actually solo well? your talking about a great MINORITY in the game. <br>
<br>
Ench nukes 1100, if you get the spec and get lucky, other wise your looking at the same 675 everyone else is using. <br>
<br>
Druids 1550 spec<br>
mages 2k etheral<br>
necros 1260 etheral<br>
clerics 1100 etheral<br>
wizards  1070 etheral<br>
2305 spec            <br>
2740 rune<br>
<br>
Charming is an intregal part of being an ench, CoD does NOT break any restrictions otehr charms have, its just as dangerous.<br>
<br>
To think this is all came from snippets of a conversation that are so small you can barely understand what they are talking about? Also never considered that the guy could just be bragging? or the guy could just be a chump? maybe he was sick of the mage's whining?<br>
<br>
Dont compair epics vs PoP spells. SoS VS. SoV Nuff said, hell even mage pet spells are better than their epic. 5 mages in a group with? ench for slows? shaman for slows? cleric for heals?<br>
<br>
You say we are over powered, did you forget how many times you died and lost exp and every one else lived? or are you one of those ench that sits back and lets others die first? or were you PLed to 65? did you use charm to get there?<br>
<br>
You say we wouldnt like it if clerics out damage us...THEY DO.<br>
They can out melle us and out nuke us. they can take more hits than us, can heal, can buff. Do i see any clerics crying for a nerf? no just you.<br>
<br>
I disagree with king that ench pet damage is needed in teir 3, its nice, btu not needed.<br>

Please DO nerf all forms of snare. it causes more druids and wizards to train other people than any other spell, its unbalanced. FD YES its over powered, i have a 63 monk, my best friend is a 65 monk, yes FD is over powered, that is if ench get nerfed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enchantedmishap@eqenchantersrealm>Enchanted Mishap</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#330000>(1/22/03 10:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A question of balance</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> your talking about a great MINORITY in the game. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Consider me the &quot;minority&quot; then.  Just cause you chose to not try it doesn't make it balanced.<br>
<br>
If VI gave warriors unlimited instaclick CH's, and the warriors &quot;chose&quot; not to use the clicks, doesn't mean that the item is balanced.  There are maybe 4-6 chanters on my server that I see constantly camping 3rd tier pop mini's/zones with only CoD+hasted pets.  <br>
<br>
If your having a problem getting CoD to stick, then I truely feel sorry for you, it has a -100mr check (which means if mobs mr is 200, CoD only checks it as though it has 100mr), add tash beforehand and your basically unresistable and your charm should last for max 90% of the time (unless mob has &gt;250mr, or you weren't able to land tash, but I wouldn't charm what I can't tash).<br>
<br>
As far as the person who stated &quot;I didn't haste my pet, since on test they removed the ability to&quot;, this only makes sence if your on test.  Obviously, an unhasted pet isn't going to show you how grossly overpowered this is/was with hasted pets.<br>
<br>
I truely hope the changes on test go live, hasted CoD pets are overpowered, adding the slow to CoD thus removing the ability to haste brings it more inline with other classes, and more inline with risk-vs-reward.<br>
<br>
BTW, someone complaining about the cost of KeI spell, join a guild either they foot the bill (since it helps them) or make them go out and raid for it.  We have 8 copies of KeI in our bank, you wanna buy one, or would you rather join us and get a copy for free? Think about it.<br>

To say that chanters need to be nerfed because we suddenly have some actual dps is pure crap. All this due to some whining about BoT minis.<br>
An Ench can outdamage a wiz in dps.  YES. <br>
A charmed mob damn well better be able to outdo others.. they are TEMPORARY, and come with significant RISK. A wiz's dps are constant.. they will always have them, and they will always be protected behind a snare. Survival mechanism built in. I would gladly drop some dps for a protective snare.. any day of the week.<br>
<br>
Chanters can make mad AA. YES - IF we could charm them without risk, but the dps that makes them unbalancing can VERY easily mutilate a chanter in a VERY short time. But I think you better look at the mobs and talk to them about it. We're just using what is around, just like charm always has. Its not our fault that VI has gone totally insane and blown EQ totally out of proportion. charm power ONLY scales directly with the mobs faced.. it can't really do anything else.<br>
<br>
BUT if we can make such mad AA, why to all the druids and Wiz in our guild have 100-200+ AA's? Not many chanters I even know of have 100+.<br>
<br>
So we get TEMPORARY uberness for SIGNIFICANT risk, with no survival mechanisms built in. (and no, arcane rune, mez, and slow aren't a survival mech against a charm. AR is pulverized in one round - the same round which easily stuns, or interrupts casting Mez, and you generally don't slow your charms) So you may get lucky channeling, and sustain a pet for a while, but the odds are not in your favor with a 6-800 hitter.<br>
<br>
Without charms, our DPS is laughable. This is our tradeoff. WE take risks, we get a bigger reward than a wiz with uber nukes, and a snare, (same for druids), or a mage with a pet that has 2-3X the hp our summons do, and who can heal the pet as well. <br>
<br>
Leave our charms alone. We've put up with enough crap in the past. There is no need to nerf a class, due to a VERY small percentage of ppl killing a highly visible mob, and pissing ppl off. Many chanters will never see those zones or spell for a long time. Don't take away the few things they have to look forward to.<br>
<br>
So we're down to the original whines.. Chanters are stealing our BoT minis.. <br>
<br>
WELL - Stick an AE 1 or 2 slot dispell on the minis'<br>
<br>
GEEE that cures the use of charms agains minis.. and shouldn't affect too many ppls fights... we should all remember the days of carrying an insta clicky for that very reason.<br>

I don't think that finding out the best way to utilize a classes' abilities is a cause to &quot;nerf&quot; that classes' reason for being.

<br>
if it is or if it isn't, basic fact is you're trying to convince a class, on their board, that they need to be gimped. What else can you do to charm that would give it ANY relevancy in the game whatsoever? I think there is some code in place that makes charms hold a lot longer in groups, after the last patch especially(avg of 7 min charms in group, avg of 2.5 min charms out over 5-10 casts). Okay so two enchanters group, or an ench and druid group, and it's still fulfulling the same purpose.<br>
<br>
How do you propose changing charm, other than taking it out of the game, that would give it ANY usefulness whether for raid or solo situations? I like the power of being able to solo successfully if i am skillfull with what i do. I think charming is a lot trickier than quad kiting, or kiting. Or soloing with a mage pet for that matter. Mage pet = nuke send in pet chain nuke till mob dead. We actually have to fight a mob, hit it with nuke at least once, slow it, while keeping our own mob which can run full speed under control, while keeping up runes, clarity, charisma, etc...<br>
<br>
sure maybe i'm biased here but no amount of arguing is going to make me agree that my class needs to be nerfed. I've seen groups at around level 60, doing pod castle and PoN and such. they suck ass, so slow, so monotonous--like 5% exp for over an hour of hunting, where i get 1% per kill in PoN @ 58<br>
<br>

IMO it should have a slow in it so that these pets can't be hasted (even though the changes would make hasting a pet virtual suicide, 2 chanters together could easily wipe the risk of a hasted pet to nearly non existant).<br>
<br>
3% aa/kill even with the changes on test, thats with the pet doing 99.9% of the dmg on a mob.  This still gives us the ability to get an aa about every hour (which is still higher than most other classes).<br>
<br>
I cannot relate to most of you in the slightest, I cannot understand where you think it's ok for us to outdmg others.  Yeah ok clerics can nuke for more dmg than we can, btw did you see the god aweful recast dly they have?  Reading most of the responses here, makes me realize why classes aren't balanced......it's because the playerbase thinks their class is broke unless their class is the best at everything.<br>
<br>
I wish there were more reasonable players in the game (or at least on various boards).  Monks are having trouble solo'ing lblues outside of PoP with recent changes to their class, it's sad.  Rogues can't even solo high greens outside of PoP, if they aren't behind the mob they basically can't do enough dmg.  Mages can't really solo with their 61+ pets in PoP, the only option they have is their puny charm but they have to get flags first.  Bards have become Puller supremes in PoP, great so monks can't solo, can't tank and can't get that 100% MW that a bard can.  <br>
<br>
When you see things like that, then you hear chanters saying &quot;we should be able to solo mini's because we sucked for 3 expantions&quot;, is just horrid.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Statements like that are extremely hypocritical, the group your seeing is grouping because they don't have the option to solo, or least not as efficiently as some class's.  The statement shows how screwed up the current state of the game is, and the light bulb isn't going on in your head.  You should feel sorry for them and either ask to be scaled to be equal to them or ask that they are scaled to be equal to you.  Them warriors have no choice but to group, clerics can opt to go for an ae group, shaman can semi solo, druids can solo a little better than a shaman (if they are charming, and how uber ensnare is when charm killing).  <br>
<br>
If the clerics decided to go get AE groups, and shaman/druids decided to solo, then who's going to heal that warrior?  With chanters charm solo'ing, less groups will have CC, slow (although their are alternate ways, shaman bard BL), Haste (again alternate ways), mind candy (ohh no wait, we all lvl'ed to 60 so we could nexus sit and get 30-100pp per KeI).  Do you see a problem?<br>
<br>
Where's the warriors option to solo?  You have the option, why can't he?  Mages lost their solo option (for the most part), Monks lost their solo option, but we can solo mini's so everything if fine, kk thx plz drv thru.<br>
<br>
You can't have an intelligent discusion with irrational people, therefore I won't further discuss this with you.  Perhaps if you weren't asking &quot;what about me, what about me&quot; you would be able to see the negative of 1 class (any class) being able to get more xp than a group, at an insanely higher rate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.showMessageRange?topicID=419.topic&start=21&stop=35>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.showPrevMessage?topicID=419.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.showNextMessage?topicID=419.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.threadControl?topicID=419.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=419.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=419.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub136.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm11">General<option value="eqenchantersrealmadminnotices">Admin Notices<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm12">Equipment<option value="eqenchantersrealmspells">Spells<option value="eqenchantersrealmfaqs">FAQs<option value="eqenchantersrealmstories">Stories<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm7">Quests<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm9">Tradeskills<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm13">Auctions<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm14">Weapons & Armor<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm15">Profiles<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm8">Off Topic/Other<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm16">Everything But EQ<option value="eqenchantersrealmfrm17">Old Stuff</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm>Eq Enchanters Realm</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm17>Old Stuff</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/eqenchantersrealm/">Eq Enchanters Realm Main Page</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31d<br>Copyright ©1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
