This allows me to mez adds et cetera.<br>
<br>
However, there is the occasional group that does not embrace the /assist concept; for whatever reasons (right or wrong).<br>
<br>
How can I better serve those groups (or should i bail on them)?  Currently, I switch tactics from Crowd control to focusing on buff/debuff PCs and MOBs respectively (after 3 or so requests to assist, i switch tactics rather then blow mana on engaged Mobs and draw unwanted aggro).<br>
However thats kinda boring and I find myself often full of mana; can't help to think that there is something more I could do... Have found DD's to not be mana-effective in a group (the 150pts I do is easily eclipsed by tanks DPS; and chain-nukeing will drop my mana quickly).  DoTs are an option; but really only get dropped once per MOB (don't believe consecutive DoTs stack).<br>
<br>
Have also tried to jump in to try to get my pet involved; bet getting aggro away from tanks isn't easy :).  Also have tried chain stunning/stun locking as well..<br>
<br>
Any other options or am I destined to roam the battlefield clean corpses and occasional buff/debuff in these groups? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dyrel>Dyrel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#330000>(10/29/03 3:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=265.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you handle various groups?</span><hr size=1> I do mostly pickup groups so have seen a very wide variety of people. I mostly found my teaching of the /assist concept was limitted to lvl 40s in Dreadlands. Usually 1 or 2 per group. Anyone in their 50s breaking mezz are usually yelled at by the rest of the group so I don't even have to bother intervening. <br>
<br>
Usually, I have found people people eager to learn right ways of doing things, so discrete direct tells explaining /assist and what mezz is, seems to do the trick. Of course, there are always idiots (not as many as I would have thought), and for them, if they dont listen, they will also be drawing tons of mana from the cleric for needlesss heals and getting the rest of the group PO's that they eventually leave anyway. If the guy is in his 50s and attacking whatever, he wont last long in anyones group since the cleric will be hopping up and down from agrivation.<br>
<br>
Personally I didn't mind debuffs and DD's. Helps build our Evocation for when the really decent DD's are given us in the 60s.<br>

In fact, I prefer to put together my own groups, and guide them myself. <br>
<br>
I do LDoN adventures quite a bit, and am very effective using lull on the next room, then backing up to the fight area, keeping buffs up and mezzing the unlikely add. I know I play in an unusual manner, but my group and I rarely have any deaths or failures. In fact, out of 40+ adv, have only lost two and I was not the leader of those two.

<br>
I had tried rooting the add so the tank on it may have a chance to run away if he can't stand the injury any more.  <br>
<br>
Once he runs away, I may re-mezz again.<br>
<br>
The worst situation is really the MT switching target with a dotter such as a necro already having assisted him on his original target with a dot.  <br>
<br>
This results in my seeing the MT on something else, and I'd cast mezz on his original targt only to have the mob wake up frm the dot effect and zoom straight for me.<br>
<br>
It happned in an LDoN adventure when a necro was the puller.  He pulled with his snare which had a dot to it.  And when an add came, the MT took on the first mob that arrived--the unsnared one.  I tried to mezz the second arriving mob and it kept waking up on me.<br>
<br>
When this happens, root is the first order of business.  Root keeps the mob away from you, and mem blur has a chance of making him forget that he's been dotted.  Once he forgets he's being hurt, you can mezz him without him waking up.<br>
<br>
It's just dawned on me the trouble of identifying which mob is the &quot;add&quot; often starts with a snare pulling.  Even with a ranger pulling with snare--half of the group would assist the MT who picks the first arriving mob, while the puller and the other half are on the snared mob.<br>
<br>
It's probably a good thing to agree beforehand which mob will be mezzed on a snare-pull. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=astyd>astyd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Enchanter Realm Master</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#330000>(11/3/03 11:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=265.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you handle various groups?</span><hr size=1> <br>
Couple of things.<br>
<br>
First from the first post, if a group does not behave and use /assist the best thing you can do is say &quot;Hold Pulls&quot;.  Once that happens, you can say are we going to use /assist or not?  If the answer comes back no, then say Thank you for the group and disband.  This is not the most pleasant thing to do, but enchanters should not die or be put at risk because of the groups lack of understanding.<br>
<br>
As for the last post, I am confused on why one would have a necro pull outside an FD setting.  If they pull multiple AND they are not FDing, then its either a mistake OR its a bad puller.  So, assuming its a mistake then the best thing that one can do is to get slows in.  Crowd control is about damage mitigation.   Mezz gets 100% damage mitigation, chanter slow can get 70% mitigation for a non-caster mob.  Generally it would be prefered in this situation that an off-tank handle the add.  Since you have a necro, the necros pet can act as an off tank.<br>
<br>
As you point out in pickup groups, communications at the start is your friend.  Otherwise learn the habits of the puller and MA and adapt your strategy.  Rooting can be a problem at higher levels if the mobs are not rootable (Hobs in PoN and Lightcrawlers in PoV come straight to mind). <br>
<br>
I have switched to playing my SK a lot lately and she snare pulls regularly.  I generally prefer myself to do this unless we are chain pulling.  This way with /assist its clear what mob I am on.  If I have another snare puller, I generally will take /assist mob unless its a long pull.  If its a very long pull, I will switch to save the Ranger.  In this case, I would send out my incoming message to announce that I am on a mob.<br>

It's a great tactic, I wish chanters used it more (though I appreciate many don't like this style of play).<br>

He asked the warrior if the warrior wanted him to pull--being that he had done Mistmoore many times and none of the rest of us had; and he said he could lull undead.  Maybe he figured the warrior would take his pull and allow me to mezz the add.  We did manage to win despite the first couple of mix-ups, and aye, slowing both mobs was the key once I realized it was impossible to mezz either mob.  The necro's pet did off-tank well.<br>
<br>
Tonight I went to HoH and our ranger's harmony failed, bringing us to face two black spirits that were immune to mezz and to root.  Again slowing both was the best solution.  But the slow had to be done with the ranger kiting the add around and me chasing.  We only had one tank.<br>
<br>
Yet on another black spirit, rooting did the trick. Ranger was able to walk away to happily shoot his arrows at MT's mob, while I had rooted the add spirt and leisurely slowed it, then kept it rooted.<br>
<br>
This to me is the fun part of playing an enchanter.  We are often facing different situations and need to think quickly for what is the best tactic on the fly.<br>
<br>
Even prior communication can fail at times.  The other night I asked a group to /assist on the first arriving mob and let me mezz the snared one.  Even though all agreed--when an add did come, the MT forgot (he was a pally) and casted stun from a distance at the snared mob, totally ignoing the first arrival.  Apparently he had /assist on the puller and forgot to switch.  Meanwhile I had already done my mezz, only to see it broken.  So I moved on to mezz the other mob, and didn't talk about it after that.<br>
<br>
Now I realize it's hard for us to depend on any promise from a group.  We just have to roll with the punches.  Part of the fun of being a coercer.  We do play key roles in helping a group through add situations.  The core part of our challenge is not really in dealing with the mobs, but in dealing with how the group is panicking.<br>
<br>
Usually the MT will try to take action as soon as possible, and he will take on the first arriving mob, and if he is a pally or sk, he may cast on the puller's target from a distance--all in the effort of taking immediate action knowing an add is on the way.  The dotter will also try to dot (jump into the frey) on the MT _OR_ the puller's target.  We just have to deal with it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Everybody is trying his/her fastest action possible.  In the end, aye, I agree once we've had a mezz broken, it's best to switch to slowing the mobs for that 70% mitigation.<br>
<br>
On lull-pulling in LDoN: Very glad to hear on some servers that is the way to go now.  When I first started LDoN, I tried convincing my groups on the idea that lull-pulling is the way to go, and was met with a lot of resistance.  People seemed dismayed by the mere suggestion, as if I the enchanter was trying to be lazy about mezzing.  I got the feeling many people out there felt our job was to mezz.  I even had one guy telling me: &quot;That's boring. I like having lots of adds.&quot;  What he was really saying was he wanted lots of adds and have me mezz them.  He didn't really want to be hit.  But I guess the sight of multiple mobs gives him a rush.  After a while I gave up trying to convince the groups.  I just let them pull adds and mezz.  Seems to make them happy that they lived through chaos.<br>
<br>
And I have to confess, now that I'm used to the chaos, I myself prefer it to the methodical pacification.  I only pacify when a puller asks for one now; and they usually do if they see a room has 4 adds standing in it.<br>
<br>
Besides, there was that one time when I tried pacification pull and and my pac got resisted... 3 mobs on me, one dead chanter in 3 seconds.  That made me decide.. err, let the tank pull 3. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Just thought of one thing.  The worst case is if there is only one tank and the dotter gets the wrong mob.  This can put the chanter in a situation where he has an angry dotted unmezzable mob chasing after him, with no second tank even around to taunt the add off him.  So I would be on high alert on this situation: If I join a group to find there is only one tank, and a dotter is in the group-- I'd ask the dotter and MT to always assist each other. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whitlan>Whitlan</A> at: 11/5/03 9:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gumbletinkertumble>Gumble Tinkertumble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Enchanter Realm Member</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#330000>(11/5/03 9:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=265.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.adstainer.f2s.com/Gumble.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you handle various groups?</span><hr size=1> This becomes even more of a problem later on, when most of our stuns don't work. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=328977" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.adstainer.f2s.com/Gumble.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

I have been in LDoN groups where lots of adds made sense.  This included bard groups and an interesting tank dominated groups (2 Pallys, 1 SK, 2 Rangers).  The idea being if the healer can keep up, DSes and such actually start to deal tons of damage.<br>

That can make the difference between life or death for the tank.<br>
<br>
In the beginning while I had to deal with all the different makeup of various groups and what strange stuff different people would do in add situations, I was searching for ONE routine I could use to take care of them all.  But the more I tried, the more I failed and realized it really takes constant on-the-fly choices.  Now I'm starting to think this is the &quot;fun&quot; of being an enchanter.  I play a cleric, druid and warrior as my alts (all of them are 65 too like my chanter), but they are boring compared to the chanter, because each of them has a set routine.  With a chanter, there is constant thinking involved.  (The druid has a bit more tactics than cleric or warrior, but not as much as chanter.)<br>
<br>
We basically have to understand our choices of tools: mezz, root, mem blur, stun, pacification, etc., and apply them according to situations.  We are constantly watching what our group is doing because we are the ones with the tools to turn a tide for a battle in case of adds.  Anyway, it can be fun, or frustrating at times.  But the more experienced we get, hopefully we'll just become more and more adapt at moving quickly to solve any situation.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think chanters have fun because we are seldom bored, having to think during combat.<br>

<br>
But I'm starting to look forward to being like one of those elder crusty chanters who barely blink at any situation before he moves to make the right choice, kind of like the ultimate kungfu master.  Little grasshoppers like me take a long time to get there, but will have fun trying. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Maybe this puller had no idea dotting would make mobs unmezzable.  Some of the people out there MAY think mezz and root are the same, and whatever spells that don't break root won't break mezz.<br>
<br>
On the occassional dotted adds: After root and slow, if the mobs are too near the group and are able to keep attacking members of the party, then you may want to try mem blur them and then mezz.  Mem blur has a chance of making them forget they are dotted.  I had done mezz successfully on dotted mobs this way before.  May take 2 mem blurs though for a mob to forget. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cerebrale>Cerebrale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#330000>(11/7/03 5:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=265.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you handle various groups?</span><hr size=1> Ya, When I was in that group, I told him twice &quot;pls don't dot all the mobs&quot; and he didn't say anything and he continued doing it.

Let me start by saying that from level 21 to 35 I have lived in LDoN.  The xp is just awesome and I want to get up high enough to group with all my friends (my other alts are in the 50's).<br>
<br>
Pulling in LDoN: Being on a time schedule I find the Lull thing to just be to slow.  I prefer the pull and I will mez the adds.  Rooms with several caster in it I will Lull then have the main puller pull.  This method has allowed me to now be 20-0 and clear 5 adventures so far.<br>
<br>
Rules:  I have a set of rules that I made up in a hot key that I state at start of group.<br>
<br>
1. I don't do mez spam, just know that all adds will be mezed. (personally I hate all the spam peeps do) Pull lines are good so everyone knows you are coming.  Snare and DoT lines are just a waste.  Everyone knows their job and you dont have to tell everyone you are doing it.  If your job is to snare (druid, ranger, SK) then just do it.  If you DoT (Necro, Shammy, Druid) just do it.  I mean what else would you be doing.  Not having all the spam makes it easy to see when someone is really in trouble and needs help.<br>
<br>
2. If I get an add on me stay on main mob I can handle it.  Every few levels I go off and do some solo charming.  This helps me learn (and now keep my skill) how to get mobs off me and has saved me a number of times when in a group.<br>
<br>
3. If an add gets on another caster stay on main mob, I will take care of it.<br>
<br>
4. Casters, if you get a mob on you please dont run all over the place.  I will get it off you.<br>
<br>
Note: to get mobs off me or another caster stun, root, mez works very well at this level.<br>
<br>
5. Everyone assist main puller/main assist.  If a different mob comes first dont switch target.  I will handle it.<br>
<br>
When everyone follows my rules things go very well.  It is when people start to not follow that things go wrong.  I now have a group of about 20 people that I group with on a regular basis and they know how I work and things just rock.<br>
<br>
One last thing, it is possible to do and adv with only 4 peeps and no real healer.  As we zoned in (on a hard adv at that) 2 people went LD (our healer and a ranger) and never returned.  Come to find out they had puter problems.  That left us with a chanter x2, pally and ranger.  The other chanter had never heard of stun locking so I taught her how to do it.  What we did was I did the stun lock thing (only have 2 stun spells so that left a few tics that mob could attack).  She was to slow and debuff mobs with damage sheild and nuke when she had mana.  This kept damage down on other two.<br>
