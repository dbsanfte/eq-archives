(kind of long....lot of bitching)</span><hr size=1> I would appreciate some feedback from other enchanters who have suffered with pickup groups until the high levels. I am currently 6pct away from 56th level and leveling is getting really hard due to the sheer ignorance of tanks in the game. Now im gonna sound spoiled to those who have played a chanter for much longer than I because I really started playing her again in mid september. I get a lot of tells from people who grouped with me then &quot;Wow! how did you level so fast?&quot; I dinged 55 last wednesday evening before I crashed and I did play some of my alts over the weekend. But it seems that in 55 my soloing days are gone. I joined a guild (im on Luclin server) because a friend was in it when I was in the teens. I never did get many groups with them and I never could find a group because everyone just goes to nexus and gets a C3 then feels they dont need an enchanter. There is the first problem. People thinking enchanters are about A) Clarity the cleric and B) Haste the tanks. Yes I know that those are two invaluable assets we provide for a group but it sinks back into the mindset that I have despised since Ive started playing EQ. That mindset is that EQ is like any other punch-em kick-em action game like Mortal Combat . The largest number of idiots Ive seen are all tanks.....and all they do is press the attack button and scream for the cleric to heal them. So enchanters are only there to make them attack faster and make the cleric heal faster. Very necessary yes but at lower levels (up to the mid 30s early 40s) they dont really appreciate the haste that level of enchanter can provide and get their mana regen from someone in nexus via C3. I saw so many groups go ahead and accept a wipe rather than to let me mezz. Now, they dont really feel the &quot;need&quot; for an enchanter the way they do for a cleric so when things get ugly I have had noone in the group help me out so I ate a lot of deaths. Ok that is to be expected....chanters are going to be on hate list big time if theyre doing their job. But that problem rolls over to when I do mezz, sometimes repeatedly, multiple adds and when they finish one mob they immediatly turn and whack the other, breaking mezz and getting me killed before I get a chance to mem blur it. I try to explain but they simply dont care because I am not critical to them.<br>
<br>
So there is where I diverged.......<br>
<br>
I started soloing around 20 something and got good at it. First I fear kited with pet then I charm kited. Other times I would just root and nuke and I would always get more xp than groups could provide cause I would get negative xp when they get me killed. I bought sow potions and C3 in nexus. I found a lot of chanters sympathetic towards lower level chanters and they didnt charge for the buff. (thanks Indite!) Quad kiting with gravity flux in OT was fun. Kiting in Dreadlands was a piece of cake. Then I took it to Burning Woods with similar effectivness. Now that Im almost 56th Ive spent a lot of time the past couple of weeks in planar PoP groups.<br>
<br>
Now the old problem comes back to haunt me. Those dumb tanks still havent learned squat. The groups as a whole are now a lot more amiable to having an enchanter because people need the slowing if no shaman is around and always need the hasting. Mezzing mobs is now essential because they hit so hard and fast. So I run into a couple groups that, sure enough, turn and whack a mezzed arachnid as soon as the treant is dead as Im still debuffing it and it spanks me good. I am not in a guild so I have to get pickup groups and its getting really hard to decide when to dump these people. Should I just keep an ignore list or should I try to educate? I grow so weary of having to explain the mezz and aggro process to a clueless 59th level monk. I dont wanna make enemies but I also dont wanna get frustrated and give up. What is your break off point when you get an uncooperative group?<br>
<br>
Any recommendations for a decent guild? I know a 65th enchanter who still isnt interested in guilds and I dont know how she handles it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luxxorautumnwood>LuxxorAutumnwood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#330000>(12/23/02 9:40:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: When to dump a group?

<br>
Did a pick up group in overthere with my cleric, had two tanks and a rogue in the group, the rogue and 1 warrior was very good about taunting before breaking mez(well rogue has no taunt but he stood behind mob waiting for war), the other warrior just smacked the mob but got sorted out by the other melees, as a cleric i prefer not to have to heal the symboled chanter, so if i can spare the mana i root the mob, if not able to before it rushes i throw my lvl 5 stun at the mob to give the chanter a few seconds to back up and tanks to regain aggro, works most of the time at my current lvl(34).<br>
<br>
Think at 50+ people should know about mezz/aggro and how to break it without getting chanter killed but i guess that is to much to ask, maybe i should continue to solo, made it to 29 so far <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sinnjatorix>Sinnjatorix</A> at: 1/10/03 1:47:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goanad>Goanad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#330000>(1/13/03 4:42:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: When to dump a group?

<br>
In many cases with POP especially, you have to give some basics otherwise you'll end up dead virtually 100 percent of the time. <br>
<br>
My most recent pet peeve involve other melee not understanding how to handle an add when and SK who is pulling has dotted the original mob. <br>
<br>
It escapes them how mezz won't land on the dotted mob(ie the mob that they are /assist) <br>
<br>
I'm getting to the point where, in such circumstances, I'm about to say &quot;screw it&quot; and just charm one of the mobs or root if it's rootable or whatever. /shrug <br>

I think that is a struggle we all have to face..however, I have the luxury of learning to chant in guild groups of some excellent people.  Pickup groups are horrible in my experience.<br>
<br>
I myself am trying to balance my PL vs grouping, as our guild is very chanter short.  We are a family-style guild, and would love to have an experienced chanter pay us a visit and get to know us!<br>

So don't worry about being an ass about it, just tell them nicely, if they don't listen be an ass, and if they still don't listen, thank them for the group and leave.

I Like to Group  just for the felling of power of Controlling Massive trains and saving the Group. Most times, if i can Get the monk to Sit down, I will Pull trains to the Group and then Mezz them off with they Single out Targets.

<br>
Use root on mez'd mobs, or on mobs that aggro you, or on dotted mobs.<br>
<br>
Request, then demand, that tanks taunt.<br>
<br>
Request they have a macro &quot;about to break mez on %T&quot;, so you can stand.<br>
<br>
Sit while tanks are /taunting mez'd mobs, and stand before they attack.<br>
<br>
Keep &quot;reoccuring amnesia&quot; or &quot;blanket of forgetfulness&quot; memed.  Tossing them on a mob does help.<br>
<br>
Train 7 groups how to work with you.  Explain that you might do some stuff a bit differently, and to bear with you.<br>
<br>
Find an ally in the group before ranting at them.  1 other clued person, forming a unified front, helps alot.<br>
<br>
Leave groups lacking clued people.<br>

You cant get to 56+ with out learning to do basics in a group unless you solo your way. if you solo you either 1) are twinked very well, 2) cant find groups, 3) get more exp soloing than in a group of 4) prefer not to have to deal with morons.<br>
<br>
#4 explains itself, #1 if you are twinked well you haev a main and should know better. #2 if you cant follow the rules there is no wonder you cant find a group. #3 why you in the group?<br>
<br>
first advice to stop agro is BUY A HORSE. yes i know its 10kish, but the glue horse cause you dont need the speed, just the fact you can med while standing. its the #1 best peice of equipment you can buy, exspecially in POP.<br>
<br>
Second make sure you stick it through 2-3 deaths, sometimes things just go wrong even in good groups, your a chanter you die. Dont get stupid though if your 56+ GROUP IS BREAKING MEZ for no reason leave after 1 warning. Boggle is your best friend so is Arcane Shield, these are both lvl 61 spells. so till you reach them your gonna have to keep mem blur up, or use dazzle and hope it's superior mem blur works. Another idea is to get Eldrich's rune, i cant say how many times that has saved me, and its instacast and has a 0.000000000001 chance of getting interupted and immediately refreshes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub136.ezboard.com/beqenchantersrealm.showUserPublicProfile?gid=biggwin>Biggwin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#330000>(1/23/03 11:55:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub136.ezboard.com/feqenchantersrealmfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: When to dump a group?

What I dont understand is how the heck you are still debuffing a mob in the time it takes to kill the first mob? Number 1 if you chain cast Tash, Cripple and Shiftless deeds on a mob, you should expect to die. My taunts will not keep up, plain and simple. And No I am not the tank that bashes taunt everytime it pops up either. I have all my spell messages up and wait until I see %t yawns or what ever you are casting atm. I can handle aggro very good for the most part. So basicly you need to be pauseing in between your cast of those three spells if you are doing them all yourself.<br>
<br>
Some steps to follow (and Im just a tank) - Mez Mob 2, Mez mob 3, etc. If you have more than 2 comeing on a regular basis Winds of Tash is great in that situation, Slow Mob 1, slow mob 2, slow mob 3, Cripple mob 1, Med. This should about get you to mob 1 dieing. So Stand the HECK up! The Tank should pick the mob that has been mez'd the longest or the one that flat out isnt mez'd. Thanks to the great taunt tanks have expect the mob to run over to you and smack you. NO RUNNING! Stand there and take it. Nothing pisses me more than taunting as soon as Mez breaks and waiting for taunt recycle, clicking it, then haveing the chanter move cuz they are getting beat on - guess what, you are taking another round of beatings! Over all it shouldnt be all that bad cuz if you remember earlier you slowed the mob!<br>

As someone stated in the thread, break down and buy a horse. No lie with all the standing you are required to do it is the greatest investment you could ever do. All the information you ever need to get horse bonus without horse drawback is <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13048&amp;highlight=care+and+feeding" target="top">Here.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I use these tatics almost daily with a Cleric, Chanter and Me for the minimum start of our group. About the only time we lose our enchaner is when mez's get resisted and both the chanter and cleric are getting beat on at the same time or we get wiped out.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Second make sure you stick it through 2-3 deaths<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->BS - One death is bad - two is to many. You should be able to keep yourself alive as long as mobs are slowed and you are runed. Root the darn thing if nothing else. If you are haveing to take these steps its time to leave. If your group isnt assisting or flat out breaking mez's tell them to knock that off - give them a warning. Then if they keep doing it type out why you are leaving their group and disband.<br>
