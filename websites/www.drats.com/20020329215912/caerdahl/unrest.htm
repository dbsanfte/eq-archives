  <p align="center"><font color="#FFCC99"> In my wanderings I had stopped in High 
    Hold to help the guards there in their fight against the Shra'Loc Orc Clan 
    that infest the southernmost part of the area. Having collected many bounties 
    from the volunteer guides and having outlived my time in the pass, I decided 
    to move on and let the younger brethren take up the fight here as I went on 
    to greater challenges. During a resting period between battles, I had the 
    occasion to talk to a travelling cleric of Rodcet Nife by the name of Vershan. 
    He told me of a haunted mansion off to the east in the land of the Fay. I 
    listened to my comrade tell of powerful daemon spawn and a host of unruly 
    undead. I, being a noble barbarian, have a particular interest in any dealings 
    with the undead. My homeland is plagued with the necromantic spawn and I have 
    seen many a comrade fall to their ilk. Vershan and I once again took up the 
    battle versus the Orcs and together we dealt them a mighty blow. He then turned 
    to me to wish me fare well, he had friends in need of his help elsewhere. 
    When our group broke up I decided it was time to move on and with the stories 
    of undead fresh in my mind I decided to book passage in Freeport for the next 
    ship to Faydwer. Although long, the trip was uneventful and I soon found myself 
    in Dagnor's Cauldron standing before a long tunnel cut through the mountain 
    that lead to the area known simply as Unrest. As I walked through the corridor 
    I noticed many slain bodies of heroes littered amongst the rubble. I knew 
    at that point I had found foes worthy of my mettle. Upon entering the area 
    a mansion loomed in front of me blotting out the life giving sun. I heard 
    cries of help to the left and when I turned I saw a fellow Shaman beckoning 
    to me to help him in his battle with a foul creature. I quickly came to his 
    aid and together we dispatched the monster. He introduced himself as Noven 
    a fellow barbarian and member of the tribunal. We teamed up and found others 
    that were here to test their mettle. With their help I quickly learned the 
    layout of the land and what creatures to battle when in a group and which 
    to focus my attention on. We battled for hours while the daemons came on and 
    on, some of us perished and some of us survived. The tale is not the one I 
    wish to speak of in this sitting, suffice to say that I had chosen some good 
    partners and some poor ones. Once I felt that I had a good understanding of 
    the area and a fair amount of experience I decided that to be truly effective 
    against these enemies I needed the help of my closest brethren, the Caer'Dathal. 
    I backed away from the battle and sat down in the tunnel and put the call 
    out to any and all friends that could meet me and help in my struggles against 
    the undead. To my surprise my first answering reply was from our powerful 
    wizard from the land of Erud, Moshi. He being the leader of our house gathered 
    together his finest nobles and bid them to join me and together we would take 
    up this fight. From near and far the Caer'Dahl traveled to enter this house 
    of evil and do battle with it's denizens. Once gathered we made a very formidable 
    group. Gathered with Moshi and I were the magician Malric, the Bard Kaanen, 
    Haramon my old time friend and wizard companion and the fair Josalea cleric 
    to Brell Serilis. We entered the estate of unrest together and quickly found 
    a spot to do battle in. Josalea, being a cleric of life, had a particular 
    distaste for the undead and to my surprise has been here before. She had scouted 
    the insides of the mansion and knew the layout well. We all decided that she 
    would be the prime candidate to explore the house and bring back any and all 
    foes she found. While she was readying herself I imbided her with the spirit 
    of the wolf so that her scouting would bring her back safety to our group. 
    Once prepared she headed out, our little gnome companion going in alone to 
    that mansion of horrors. I wonder at her bravery. While she was out our friend 
    Malric summoned an elemental companion to help us while Moshi and Haramon 
    readied their most powerful spells. Kaanen sung an anthem de'arms that made 
    me feel like I could take on the whole place single handedly. Together we 
    awaited our friend. Josalea returned moments later with a lurking mummy, a 
    tormeted dead and a trio ghouls hot on her trail, she quickly took position 
    between Kaanen and I while the daemon horde came at us. We all decided to 
    fight the mummy first as it was the more powerful of the three. Jasarer, the 
    elementling pet of our mage was the first to strike a blow. While it slashed 
    the mummy with shards of ice Josalea and I bashed it with our mighty maces. 
    Kaanen kept up the rhythm while slashing the being unmersissly. From behind 
    Moshi, Malric and Haramon let loose their fire and together we quickly dispatched 
    the Mummy. The ghouls were casting spells of their own trying to hamper our 
    efforts but they too soon fell to the wayside, no match for our combined efforts. 
    When we were done we looked and the corpses laying around us and we rejoiced. 
    "Beware denizens of Unrest, the Caer'dahl have come to play!" I shouted in 
    my battle fury. We battled on into the night and reveled as foe after foe 
    fell to our rage. We caused quite a stir and a bit of envy from the other 
    groups that had formed around the mansion. We were quite successful against 
    the undead that inhabited the lower levels of the mansion that we became a 
    haven for other people to bring their foes to if they were unable to dispatch 
    them. It was in one of these instances that we met our greatest challenge.

    <p><font color="#FFCC99">We were resting by the fountain just in front of 
      the estate when a magician from another party came running past us screaming 
      for her life. Behind her I heard a loud screeching that was so filled with 
      malice that my hackles stood up on end. I rose from my meditation to come 
      face to face with the most diabolical creature I had seen to date. A monster 
      from the depths of the estate where it is rumored that Bertoxxulous himself 
      visits, a Werebat. It's eyes were a deep set crimson and its wings spanned 
      at least six feet across. The talons at the end of those appendages were 
      razor sharp and soaked with the mage's blood. "Please help me" was all she 
      could say before the terror ripped her flowing black robe to shreds, we 
      watched in stunned horror as she died. "NOOO' was all I heard to the left 
      of me as Josalea flung herself and the werebat. she swung her mace and smited 
      the beast, quickly drawing it's attention to us. Kaanen was next to join 
      the fight as he bit into it's left wing with a mighty slash of his sword. 
      Moshi and Haramon fired off their most powerful spells and burned the creature. 
      I looked on in horror as it just shrugged off their efforts and truly looked 
      more evil with my companions fire dancing around it's body. I jumped in 
      and joined my companions in the melee while Malric directed his pet to attack 
      while he too took up the fight and started stabbing the monster with his 
      dagger. I took a quick look at our collective health and saw to my astonishment 
      our members health dwindling rapidly. Kaanen kept distracting it and drawing 
      its wrath upon himself and Josalea and tried furiously to heal him and the 
      other members of our party. Malric my newfound brother in arms slashed the 
      beast and drew its wrath upon himself. The werebat took one swing at him 
      with it's mighty talons and ripped his throat out, bringing him well past 
      the point where Josalea or I could help him. A dread fell over me as I watched 
      him fall. The beast then decided to pay its attention to our leader Moshi 
      as he was dealing it the most damage with his offensive spells. If flew 
      over to his position and started to bite at his arms while he tried to cast 
      spell after spell upon the creature. Kaanen and I slashed and beat repeatedly 
      at it's backside while Josalea cast healing spell after healing spell on 
      her beloved husband. She cried in anguish as her love fell to the beasts 
      clutches. I have never seen a more fearsome look than the one I saw come 
      from her lovely face. She turned into a daemon herself as she attacked the 
      werebat with a hate that only Innoruuk himself could match. We fought on 
      in renewed fury as the beast slashed and bit at our arms and torsos. We 
      had nearly beaten the beast as I realized that I was out of mana and Josalea 
      was low as well. Kaanen sung a hymn of restoration to help our efforts but 
      that only enraged our combatant more. Josala was to the right of the creature 
      crushing it with all her might as Kaanen and I fought side by side to slay 
      the evil spawn. I felt weaker and weaker as the those claws ripped apart 
      my armor and found the fragile bones and flesh underneath. Josalea screamed 
      for Kaanen and I to run for our lives while she held it off but Kaanen and 
      I held our ground. This act however was one of my undoing. It tore open 
      my tunic and stabbed its talon into my heart stopping it's life giving efforts, 
      I too fell to it's mighty clutches. I awakened and found myself reincarnated 
      in the spot where I had prayed to the Hammers to bind me. I rushed back 
      to the mansion empty of belongings and armed only with the powers invested 
      in my by the gods of justice. I returned to find Josalea sitting next to 
      the slain werebat with kaanen singing his song of healing and respite. Littered 
      around the foul beast was ttheirhe bodies of my companions and one by one 
      they returned from their binding points to regain lost possessions. We stayed 
      on for a while and fought other lesser undead but as time wore on, other 
      demands were made of my companions and they had to go to other areas to 
      help out where needed. We broke up shortly after and went our separate ways. 
      But I will never forget the bravery and valor we showed against our greatest 
      enemy to date.</font></p>
