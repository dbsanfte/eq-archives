    <p><font color="#FFCC99"><u><b><font size="7">What EQ god do you worship? 
      </font></b></u></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFCC99"><u><b><font size="7">By Anonymous</font></b></u></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFCC99"> <font size="5">The time of the old gods is at an 
      end. With the passing of the age known as 'Betatest', and the coming of 
      the next age, the old gods no longer hold power over the land of Norrath. 
      A new breed of people calling themselves 'paying customers' have settled 
      the land and brought with them a host of new gods. Following is a listing 
      I have compiled during my travels over the land. </font></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFCC99" size="5"><i>Sorebottom O'Boredom</i>, god of camping. 
      Sorebottom is a dull and lazy god who requires the same devotion from his 
      followers. They worship him by sitting on their arses for hours or even 
      days at a time at his various holy places like Highhold Pass, Temple of 
      Cazic Thule, Najena, and Guk. His followers pay homage to him by auctioning 
      off their goods to the highest bidder. Their prayer chants include 'Selling/trading 
      rubicite for a good wizard item', 'Get in line', and 'You kill-stealing 
      bastard, I've camped this spot for 3 days straight'. Sorebottom and his 
      followers are the arch enemy of 'Wizfire' Wizfire, god of kill-stealing. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFCC99" size="5"><i>Wizfire</i> is an evil, selfish deity. 
      He is primarily worshipped by wizards, but some druids and mages worship 
      him also. Wizfire requires vast number of sacrifices to sate his hunger 
      for blood, so his followers travel the lands killing everything in sight. 
      He is the arch enemy of Sorebottom, with whom he shares a parasitic relationship. 
      Both are worshipped in many of the same places, but Wizfire and his followers 
      live off the same prey. Wizfire and his followers are hated throughout the 
      land. Nurph, god of class balancing. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFCC99" size="5"><i>Nurph</i> is a very feared god, more 
      appeased than worshipped. He is like a plague, feared by all players, who 
      live in fear that his chilling hand is not placed on their class' head. 
      Nurph requires sacrifices, which he gets primarily from druids, shamans, 
      and necromancers in the form of spells and abilities. He has no worshippers 
      or holy places, although his avatar, Arudune is sometimes seen stalking 
      the land, looking for good spells or successful strategies to feed to his 
      ravenous master. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFCC99" size="5"><i>Playorun Economie</i>, god of trade skills. 
      Playorun is a greedy god who takes his due from every successful trade skill 
      in the form of profits. No skill is safe from his grasping hands, as he 
      leeches the bank accounts of any foolish enough to try them. He is also 
      worshipped by the many merchants in the land who buy items for but a fraction 
      of their worth and sell them for hundreds of times their value. Whenever 
      an enterprising mortal tries to outwit Playorun, by making money from a 
      skill, he calls upon his brother, the god Nurph to smite the offender and 
      any who would follow him.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFCC99" size="5"> <i>Powyrgamyr</i>, god of levelling. Powyrgamyr 
      is crazed god, worshipped by hordes of raving, lunatics. These madmen roam 
      the land killing everything in sight, never stopping, never sleeping, until 
      they eventually drop dead from exhaustion. They are like a plague of locusts, 
      destroying everything in their path in their mad quest to appease their 
      god. Once a mortal gives his soul to Powyrgamyr, he breaks off all relationships, 
      leaving friends and family behind, as they embark on their holy quests for 
      experience, fame and wealth. Those that survive the quest, usually turn 
      from Powyrgamyr and become worshippers of </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFCC99" size="5"><i>Twynker</i>. Twynker, god of newbies. 
      Twynker is a kind god, worshipped by many newbies. The basic philosophy 
      of the worship of Twynker is reincarnation. His followers believe that if 
      they live a good and productive life, amassing wealth and items, they will 
      be reborn into newbies, and be allowed to live off the gains of their previous 
      life. As such, the followers of Twynker are viewed with jealousy and hatred 
      by other mortals. They must endure much hatred and insults, but the consolation 
      that they have better stuff than anyone else helps them cope. You can see 
      Twynker's followers wherever there is a gathering of newbies. They are the 
      ones killing rats, bats and fire beetles while dressed in full rubicite 
      armor.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFCC99" size="5"> <i>Roel Playor</i>, god of perpetual low 
      levels. Roel Playor is a benevolent god, worshipped by mortals through out 
      the land of Norrath. They are well known for their verbose language and 
      strange way of speaking. Most of them are kind, gentle beings who only want 
      to live their lives in peace and harmony with the land and its inhabitants. 
      However, their religion has recently been infiltrated by the followers of 
      Wizfire. They are usually dark elves, trolls, and ogres who hide behind 
      the teaching of Roel Playor, as an excuse to appease their god, Wizfire. 
      These heretics are also known as azhoels.</font> </p>
