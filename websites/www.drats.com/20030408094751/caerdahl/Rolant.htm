  <p align="center"><font color="#FFCC99" size="4"> Profile: I came to Seattle 
    6 years ago from Japan (so bear with me if I make grammatical errors) :). 
    I have been a role playing game fanatic since Wizardry 1 (never was into Ultima, 
    I don't know why). I even enjoyed playing a wizard in table talk RPG back 
    in Japan long time ago. I always thought I was magic user type so I first 
    started EverQuest as an Erudite wizard on other server, but I stopped at level 
    4 because it didn't feel right for me. So I started a cleric on Tunare and 
    now I'm loving it. It has been a great feeling that I can actually help out 
    people who are in danger. Of course I sometimes envy all the powers that wizards 
    and other casters have, but I can say I'm totally satisfied with my cleric. 
    Rolant is my one and only character now. I have met great people from EverQuest 
    (Enthalpy, Laradorm, we had fun hunting those zombie sailors!), and I'm looking 
    forward to the future adventures with people I'm meeting from the guild (Moshi, 
    Josalea, I can't wait to go back to Unrest with you!).</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#FFCC99" size="4"> CHARACTER Name: Rolant Starfield 
    Race: Human Class: Level 26 Cleric of Rodcet Nife Profile: He was born and 
    raised in Qeynos. His mother died when he was still an infant. His father 
    was also a cleric of Rodcet Nife but was killed by a dark elf when Rolant 
    was 12. He had had hostile feelings toward dark elves since his father's death, 
    but when another dark elf saved his life when he was 18, he realized prejudice 
    does nothing good. He is glad that he chose the way of becoming a cleric of 
    Rodcet Nife like his father, and takes his pride in healing people. He doesn't 
    talk much, but he loves people who travel with him. Though he hasn't been 
    able to do for a long time, he likes to cook when he has some free time. His 
    specialty is fish fillet, he actually used to make some money cooking them 
    in the past. He is thinking about starting brewing because he likes to drink! 
    Learning other languages is one of his favorites, too. </font></p>
