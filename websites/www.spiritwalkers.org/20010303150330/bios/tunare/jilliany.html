              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It is difficult 
                for me to talk about my past even though my life has changed dramatically 
                in the past ten years. However, I think the members of the Spiritwalkers 
                that I have asked to trust and befriend me should know all that 
                entails.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Somewhere 
                in the deep frozen mountains of Everfrost veiled by magic from 
                all human eyes lies a tower and fortress. Inside that cold fixture 
                of marble resides a cruel and evil woman. Her name is Jaide, and 
                to call her mother would be a sacrilege, but she is the woman 
                who gave me life. Although I have never witnessed it I have been 
                told that once upon a time, Jaide was someone I would have liked. 
                Unfortunately I find this hard to believe. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Jaide was 
                a shaman and very skilled at the craft but she was consumed by 
                the need for power. She did not seek monetary power but knowledge, 
                and control over all off things living and dead. In her travels 
                and adventures, Jaide became acquainted with a rogue tribe of 
                Dark Elf necromancers. As she studied with them her power became 
                twisted and so did her mind. She abandoned all the teachings of 
                the tribunal and the forces she had once used for good were now 
                turned for her evil purposes. By the time I was two, Jaide had 
                been banished by the tribunal never to step foot in the lands 
                of the barbarians again by punishment of death. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The next 
                eight years of my life are a blur, rejected by a mother who hated 
                the very sight of me. I was isolated from anyone but the other 
                necromancers and dark elves who studied with her. Residing in 
                a home where even the servants were perverted undead attendants, 
                I have tried not to remember any of it. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">My one comfort 
                in life was a locket that played a soft lullaby and contained 
                a picture of my grandfather and my uncle. As a child I knew nothing 
                of the locket except that it helped me maintain my sanity. Jaide 
                had told me that the pictures were of my grandfather and uncle, 
                Jared and Jac MacGrove. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Jaide despised 
                me mostly because she saw me as a nuisance but also because I 
                refused to be her apprentice. This was not a stand that made her 
                happy. I refused to help her in her experiments and was often 
                flogged for my brazen way of offending her guests. Regardless 
                of what Jaide sanctioned even then I knew what she was doing, 
                her magic, even her very soul was evil and sinister.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I would often 
                confront and beseech her to send me to my father if my presence 
                disturbed her so much. I n fact I would often beg her just to 
                tell me who my father was and where he was. As a child I even 
                imagined that he might be Cazic-Thule or worse yet Bertoxxulous. 
                One evening when I was ten, I could not stand Jaide's ranting 
                any longer. I opened my locket in an attempt to silence her droning 
                with its sweet lullaby. She screamed at me and tried to snatch 
                the locket from my neck. To my amazement and hers the locket released 
                a bolt of energy than threw her across the room. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Hand me 
                that locket," Jaide demanded.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"No, I will 
                not," I said shaking my head and clutching the necklace with both 
                hands to protect it from her grasp. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Then, you 
                will die!" Jaide screamed</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"That is 
                hardly a threat for death would be preferable to remaining here 
                a moment longer," I screamed back. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"So be it." 
                I felt my life force ebb from me as I blacked out. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Days later 
                I awoke in a bed made of bear skins and I heard the voice of a 
                very old man say, "sip the broth slowly, deary."</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Where am 
                I and who are you? Is this the hereafter?" I queried.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"No my dear" 
                he chuckled, "I am Greywolfe a very old friend of your grandfather 
                and uncle. I created that locket for you even before you were 
                born. Your grandfather knew your mother would eventually loose 
                her mind, and knew that if you opposed her evil she would try 
                to destroy you. In that case the locket was to bring you back 
                here. Unfortunately your grandfather has passed on but I have 
                sent for your Uncle. He and his wife will be here in a few months 
                to collect you, until then you can enjoy my hospitality and that 
                of my village."</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"What of 
                Jaide?" I asked. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"She believes 
                you dead, felt your life force leave you herself she did, or thinks 
                she did," he added with a wink of his eye. "Then she saw you teleport 
                away, convinced that her magic was stronger than your grandfather's. 
                And she would be right about that but it is not more powerful 
                than mine is. Sadly I do not think she will look for you for she 
                is evil and cares for nothing but herself. I know that must cause 
                you much pain little one."</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"No sir," 
                I stated with great resolve. "It, it causes me only relief and 
                joy for you have shown me more tenderness in the last 10 minutes 
                that Jaide did in the last 10 years." With that statement, I cried 
                myself back to sleep as he held me in his arms.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">During the 
                next four months as I awaited my Uncle Jac and his new wife Rosin, 
                I found that I was in the village of the Tribal barbarians of 
                the far north tundra. There I learned what it was like to be a 
                child, with no cares and responsibilities. I still swear that 
                the first time I ever heard laughter was when I saw a boy of 12, 
                wrestling in the snow with his pet wolf. I soon found out that 
                he was Greywolfe's grandson Wolfegar. For the time I remained 
                in his village Wolfegar showed me everything and taught me that 
                life could be a joy not a torture, as only another child could 
                do. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the ten 
                years since my rescue, for that is how I see it anyway, my life 
                has been radically different. My uncle and aunt, are the salt 
                of the earth and as they themselves are childless, have made everyday 
                of my life with them one of joy and pleasure. Their love for me 
                abounds and my love for them, I think of them as my parents for 
                I have known no others in that manner. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I also found 
                as I grew that my grandfather Jared MacGrove was as revered by 
                the Shamans of Six Hammers as Jaide was despised by them. I also 
                discovered that the magic in my blood is as great as the force 
                that possessed my grandfather and Jaide. At first I feared this 
                power and was convinced that it would consume me as it did Jaide. 
                But my uncle and the Shamans of the Council have shown me that 
                this logic is flawed. It appears that the locket was in itself 
                a test of my purity of heart. When my mother first began her tainted 
                rituals she was pregnant with me. My grandfather and all the elders 
                were not sure if her dark ceremonies would corrupt only herself 
                or me, her unborn child as well. They believed that if I remained 
                steadfast and good of heart the locket would protect me and activate 
                when it became necessary to remove me from Jaide's terrorizing. 
                My very presence in Halas is proof of my worthiness to follow 
                in my grandfather's footsteps. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">My uncle 
                has done two acts that have made me confident in my control of 
                my gifts. First, he bestowed to me my grandfather's armor and 
                weapon to use as I adventure. By doing this I believe he as given 
                me a link to my grandfather's goodness and power. Second, he introduced 
                me to Duncaan Macleod, one of my grandfather's last pupils. I 
                have accepted Duncaan as my mentor and through his teaching and 
                wise council I have learned much of my grandfather and his ways. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Wolfegar's 
                clan was destroyed it was natural for him to come to Halas and 
                seek out my family. Secretly, I believe it was Jaide and her evil 
                companions who destroyed the village and killed his people. I 
                fear Greywolfe was wrong about Jaide's power. I believe that she 
                knows I am alive and since she destroyed Greywolfe in the raid, 
                now fears only me. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yes, fears 
                me, for I am sure that she believes that I will be the only person 
                who can ever destroy her. This is why she tried for so many years 
                to corrupt my spirit as she had done her own. She knows, she failed 
                and knows that I still live. She feels my presence and goodness 
                haunting her just as her vile evil soul haunts me. I believe the 
                only way I will ever truly have peace is for her to die. I am 
                convinced she feels the same way about me. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I loathe 
                undead and the art of necromancy. I will go out of my way to destroy 
                their evil. I also will never trust a dark elf for the memories 
                of those that tortured me are too vivid. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I still do 
                not know who my father was. I do not even know if he is alive 
                but I continue to search for someone who can answer these questions 
                for me. Unfortunately I think this secret died with my grandfather. 
                I do know that he was an honorable man, who turned from Jaide 
                when she first corrupted her soul and never knew of my existence. 
                I often wonder what he would think of me if we were to meet today.</font></p>
