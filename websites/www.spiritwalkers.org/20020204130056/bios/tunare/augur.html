              <div class=Section1> 
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  Augur walked 
                  into the darkened tavern, the smell of cooking meat melding 
                  imperfectly with the crude makings of the locally-brewed ale 
                  setting his already battle-tempered nerves on edge.  He was 
                  in a mood for violence, and hungry graves begged for tenants. 
                  </span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  Even from 
                  the threshold doorway he could see them staring at him; his 
                  imposing form filling the entrance, his mighty axe &quot;Warbringer&quot; 
                  held ridged in his hand in defiance of the town ordinance against 
                  openly bared weapons.  All eyes were set upon him; this Angel 
                  of Death standing at the entrance to this foul den.  He returned 
                  the glare from the tavern common room, a glare set upon him 
                  by the masses of drunkard humans who stood or lay before him 
                  in lewd positions.  Under different circumstances he would have 
                  been just another adventurer looking to wash the trail dust 
                  from his throat with a tankard of honey mead, but tonight was 
                  different; tonight he was in the den of evil, the tavern known 
                  as &quot;The Black Lodge&quot;, home of the vermin followers 
                  of the Plague Lord.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  He stood 
                  at the doorway leading into the main room of the tavern, smiling 
                  slightly as he thought about Brother Trintle, the mouth of the 
                  darkling demigod, who gave his knowledge of this foul place 
                  after being &quot;coaxed&quot; by Warbringer.  Augur remembered 
                  the harsh blood-frothed words issuing from Trintle’s crushed 
                  throat, Warbringer imbedded deep within the monk’s chest.  To 
                  the victor comes the spoils of war, and information flowed easily;the 
                  lair, the guild-master, the trade in slave flesh, The Black 
                  Lodge as the center of it all in a fair city.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  His gaze 
                  swept across the room for what seemed to be an endless time. 
                   He stared at each member of the cursed Order of Disease, allowing 
                  his sleepy-eyed look to pause at each of them and continue on. 
                   Outside, a storm howled, as if in anticipation of the carnage 
                  to follow; shutters barely holding against the violence of the 
                  storm.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  &quot;It 
                  is time&quot; he thought to himself.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>With a muttering 
                  of evil laden words, the crowd rushed him.  First to die was 
                  the bartender wielding a cask-opening pick.  The man slashed 
                  pitifully at Augur, who spun his axe a full circle and removed 
                  the bartender’s weapon and hands.  Continuing the motion, Augur 
                  swept the axe blade across the man’s throat, spraying crimson 
                  blood, impaling him with the terminal spike on Warbringer’s 
                  top.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  Augur hefted 
                  the lifeless corpse over his back, freeing Warbringer to slice 
                  down on the next opponent, slashing him from shoulder blade 
                  to groin, splitting him in twain.  Warbringer danced through 
                  the air singing it's sweet song of whistling death. With a backhand 
                  motion from its wielder, Warbringer slashed two opponents through 
                  the midsection, hewing cleanly through them, only to return 
                  to a parry position against a whistling rapier.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  Remembering 
                  his training with the Wolves of the North, Augur allowed the 
                  rapier to come close to his chest, then spun Warbringer once 
                  to free this delicate rouge’s weapon from its masters hand to 
                  spin across the room.  Warbringer came down on the now defenseless 
                  man’s head and buried itself deep within his chest.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  Augur's 
                  heavy crafted boot struck against the dead man’s midsection; 
                  tossing it several feet into the advancing crowd, freeing Warbringer. 
                   In a semi-circular flourish Augur changed his hand-hold on 
                  the axe, steppingg back into battle position for the next tide 
                  of cultists who rushed him still.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  He felt 
                  the unholy might of the Dark Lord’s presence slam against his 
                  barbarian fortitude; a priest of the Plague God chanting foul 
                  words of contempt, invoking a might filled enchantment against 
                  him.  Augur reeled in the pain as magical energies coalesced, 
                  witch-lighting his hidden tattoos of faith in Rallos Zek beneath 
                  his blued Centaur-crafted amour. Llight issued from beneath 
                  his breastplate, illuminating his face in the death grimace 
                  of the reaper.  Augur screamed a challenge to the dark god in 
                  his native tongue as he laid Warbringer into the priest.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  Sparks flowed 
                  like the death-scream of a thousand will-o-wisps from the vile 
                  plague bringer’s chest as Warbringer struck deeply.  Augur allowed 
                  Warbringer to rest momentarily in the dead man, and drew an 
                  ancient dagger from his shoulder harness, only to bury it in 
                  the throat of another pitiful follower of Disease.  Spinning 
                  around on his heel, Augur frees his mighty war-axe and dagger, 
                  swinging both in a wide arc to meet his next opponent.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  In waves, 
                  in single combat, in teams of two and three they came. The floor 
                  of the tavern became slick with the lifeblood of the Rat Prince's 
                  minions. One after another Augur slew them, with precision and 
                  speed.  </span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  Filled with 
                  the rage of mighty Rallos, Augur battled on. Though sorely wounded, 
                  none were so grievous as to stop him and his mission. He battled 
                  on, reveling in the blood and carnage, alternately singing or 
                  screaming vows to Rallos Zek making an opera of death, the crowd 
                  obliging in morbid participation.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  None, save 
                  one, survived that eve.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  The thick 
                  oak door of the tavern opened, the cruel wind entering the tavern 
                  battering the tallow candles into submission.  Standing in the 
                  center of the carnage was Augur, facing the city guard of Qeynos, 
                  the servants of Antonious Bayle; their helms pulled low in a 
                  futile effort to protect them from the stench of death permeating 
                  the room.  Augur stared at them from within his blood-drenched 
                  massive helm, chest heaving from the long combat.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  For a moment 
                  the guards stared blankly at the crimson soaked barbarian standing 
                  in front of them.  Then, with a smile that a groom might give 
                  his bride on their wedding night, they respectfully bowed, backed 
                  out of the tavern, and closed the door behind them.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  Augur raised 
                  Warbringer in salute to Rallos Zek and prayed thankfully.  Dropping 
                  to one knee he offered the fallen to Zek, offered himself as 
                  the engine of death and retribution, offered all that he owned 
                  and was. </span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  With a swift 
                  motion, the mighty barbarian kicked a remaining cask into the 
                  fireplace, setting the tavern ablaze, sanctifying it with cleansing 
                  fire, destroying the foul, misguided occupants.</span></p>
                <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  From afar, 
                  heartbeats later, Augur sat on horseback and watched the tavern 
                  burn to the ground, and smiled.</span></p>
