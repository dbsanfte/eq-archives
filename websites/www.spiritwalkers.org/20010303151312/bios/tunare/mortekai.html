              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I am Mortekai 
                Spiritwalker, born to a family which has know both triumph and 
                tragedy. Gather 'round ye who would listen, for I tell a tale 
                now of History and Destiny. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Grown am 
                I now to be a man of my middle years, respected by my community, 
                loved by my family, and feared by the unjust. Yet it was not always 
                so in my youth. . </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I was a third 
                child, born many a year after my sister Edain, and only two short 
                years past the still-birth of my father's only other son. Edain 
                was the star of my parent's heart, for I was not the strapping 
                warrior my father had hoped to follow him. Instead, I was a small 
                lad, given to mischief and sloth, sneaking away from my lessons 
                with the sword and shield, and finding for myself many forms of 
                trouble. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Since I was 
                the last of my parent's children, I was left in the care of Edain 
                when they passed from this realm to the next, safely guided and 
                rewarded by The Tribunal. Edain's power with the spirits grew 
                and grew, as did her love of a mighty warrior, Culbarth.They were 
                married, and I continued to live in their shadow, having no claim 
                of my own to glory or honor. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Edain and 
                Culbarth had three children, Joril, Calamon, and Sanu. And when 
                disaster struck, taking from me my sister and her husband, I was 
                left, a young man, to raise three small children. This was to 
                be the seminal event in my life. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Responsibility, 
                listener, will change your very soul. Where before there had been 
                no calls upon me for anything, I now had to provide for mouths 
                and bellies that were never full. I learned the value of labor, 
                the need to set a good example and more, the wealth that is the 
                love of a child. So much was I changed that I grew in respect 
                in my home of Halas. And with the respect of others came a sense 
                of self-worth, pride and well being. The conditions were right 
                for me to finally hear the spirits, and slowly, I became aware 
                of them, and the powers they would eventually provide me. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But my story 
                does not end here, for this is only the beginning of my tale. 
                At the prompting of the spirits, I traveled to far Qeynos, lending 
                my meager healing powers to fight an awful plague, unleashed by 
                the followers of Bertoxxulos. Many died, and the death was a lingering 
                foulness that ate the life out of its victims. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Relatives, 
                one's of which I had been unaware, died there. They left a daughter, 
                Morrighan, and none of her other family would take her in. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Touched, 
                she is," they said, "filled with the darkness!" </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Help her, 
                for she is to you as shadow is to light, the darkness with defines 
                the day, " whispered the spirits. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I was moved. 
                I knew I could not leave this child alone in the world, and so 
                I adopted her, and raised the child with the other three. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now my children 
                are grown, and I am a man of my middle years, tempered by labor, 
                love and seasoned with wisdom. The spirits are my guides, my power, 
                and my life. I travel the land, I help those in need. And perhaps, 
                just perhaps, I show some the truth. Those that see it may someday 
                join me as a Spiritwalker. </font></p>
