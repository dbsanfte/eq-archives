            <td colspan="3">
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For as long 
                as the races have existed on Norrath, there have been those who 
                live by the seas, leading simple lives harvesting the bounty of 
                the oceans. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the shores 
                of Odus, the island home to the city of Erudin, is the Reefshard 
                family, a family of two daughters, Tasha and Coral. Deep is the 
                faith in Prexus in this family, and Tasha, though not called to 
                priesthood, learned and believed the truths of the oceans. She 
                has built many a castle of sand in homage to the great power of 
                the seas. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Being the 
                oldest child, Tasha developed a fierce and protective love for 
                her younger sister Coral. When Coral was called to a sacred duty 
                for Prexus, it was Tasha who promised her powers of magic to Coral's 
                protection. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A long and 
                hazardous journey from Odus to Faydwer was called for, Coral to 
                carry a sacred vial from a holy shrine to the dark citadel of 
                Castle Mistmoore. The journey involved many dangers not to be 
                spoken of now, but Tasha was equal to the task. She guided her 
                sister, protecting her from the many fell creatures who would 
                prey upon such a young priest. They come at last to Mistmoore. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Slowly they 
                advance upon the gates to the dark citadel, fearing its foul reputation; 
                its dark powers kept barely in check. Closer they come, and Tasha 
                feels herself weaken, her strength insufficient to hold back the 
                darkness. She sees Coral, face paled and emotionless, raise the 
                sacred vial above her head, and enter the courtyard. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mists swirl 
                and coalesce, a dark figure appearing. He is the color of death, 
                carries the stench of decay, and wears a smile of pure, unnatural 
                bliss. His hands perform arcane motions, and the gate seals itself 
                by growing strangely translucent flesh at a blinding pace. He 
                beckons to the young Coral, and she moves to him, emotionless, 
                like one in a trance. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tasha calls 
                to her sister, vainly trying to pierce the gate's unnatural flesh 
                with her powers, but Coral does not respond. In horror Tasha can 
                only watch. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How good 
                of you to bring me the price your mother agreed to pay. The vial 
                is your spirit, and its power shall give me flesh once more!" 
                cries the dark figure. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Grant me 
                life, Dark Powers, as I drink the spirit of the young woman. Give 
                me that which I have bargained for, and the Reign of Blood will 
                be yours!" </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coral lifts 
                the vial, dropping to her knees, proffering her very essence to 
                the beast of un-life. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Horror reaches 
                new depths in Tasha's soul, and she draws strength from it. Taking 
                her enchanted knife, she strikes the flesh-covered gate, tearing 
                at it. A gash is opened, and the foul stuff bleeds a filthy ichor 
                on to Tasha's flesh. An opening present, she pours the last of 
                her remaining power into a spell. It is a small pitiful thing, 
                but it is enough to shatter the vial, but only after some of its 
                contents have drained between the foul thing's lips. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Swirls of 
                light and the clean fresh smell of an ocean breeze escape, and 
                Coral's face again shows signs of life. Parts of the dark beings 
                body seem to have grown whole, and the desiccated flesh which 
                covered its face reveal fangs and the beauty which was once a 
                fair Teir'Dal man. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Trickery! 
                Deceit! Betrayal you seek to commit! Tonight I was to be made 
                whole! You have stolen it from me creature, and I curse you for 
                my revenge!"</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coral rushes 
                to Tasha's side, lifting her from where she has collapsed, holding 
                her. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Lightning's 
                strike and thunder's bay, I sunder you with night and day! Until 
                my thirst for life you slake, one must sleep whilst the other 
                does wake!" </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the dawn 
                rose and Tasha's strength returned Coral collapsed into a deep 
                slumber. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so it 
                is done, a curse upon the sisters, for only one can walk awake 
                and they are divided, never to meet again until it is broken.
