<BR><BR>
<BR>
*** Tradeskill Revamp ***<BR>
<BR>
- All of the tradeskill recipes in the game are moving to a "no sub-combine" system. In order to improve the availability and reduce the tedium of the tradeskill system, we are removing refine and interim recipes from the game. Instead you will be able to craft final combines with just raw components. It will now take less time to craft a cup of coffee in game than in your kitchen!<BR>
<BR>
- Tradeskill-related harvestables now have a chance to give multiple items in a single harvest. As your skill increases over the maximum skill for that 10 level range, you increase your chances at getting rares and multiple item harvests.<BR>
<BR>
- New harvesting tools are available that reduce the time it takes to harvest. Speak with your local woodworker to acquire these items.<BR>
<BR>
- Crafted items will now be referred to either as Handcrafted or Mastercrafted, the latter of which denotes rarer items.<BR>
<BR>
- Newly crafted items will often have different stats or effects. Note that existing crafted items will not change, just items crafted using the new recipes.<BR>
<BR>
- Crafted potions and poisons will be now will follow a uniform pattern in naming and effects, which should make their functionality easier to identify quickly.<BR>
<BR>
- Level 50-60 rare carpentry recipes have been added to the game. You might be seeing some of your favorite requested furniture pieces that are no longer sold on merchants.<BR>
<BR>
- Due to rising economic pressure from the larger crafting guilds such as the Ironforge Exchange and the Coalition of Tradesfolke, the smaller societies within the districts and villages have consolidated their operations in order to continue to compete.
  * Players can now enter any of the tradeskill instances at any time.
  * All your tradeskill society status you have ever earned (not just in your current society) has been converted into personal status points (this will not add status to your guild).<BR>
<BR>
- With the new changes to recipes no longer requiring subcombines, the cities of Freeport and Qeynos have been forced to do inventory and sell or reforge many of their overstocked supplies. Until this is finished, they will not be giving out any new work orders for crafted items. Both Lucan and Antonia apologize for the inconvenience this may cause some business owners and thank you for your patience until this matter is resolved.<BR>
<BR>
- The tradeskill trainers have been moved outside each of the tradeskill instances. These trainers will give new crafters their initial training and first set of recipes if they did not learn their skills on the Outpost of the Overlord or the Queen's Colony before sailing to the city.<BR>
<BR>
- Harvested items that are no longer used in recipes can be used in place of raw components.<BR>
<BR>
- All interim and refined components can now be used in place of raw items.<BR>
<BR>
- Merchants outside each tradeskill instance will sell recipe books for all artisan classes. The recipes that appear will depend on your selected tradeskill and level.<BR>
<BR>
- You will no longer fail to find something when you harvest in an area that is trivial to you.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
*** Betrayal and Exiles ***<BR>
<BR>
- Players can now betray their city at any time after level 10.<BR>
<BR>
- You will now slowly work your faction up with the city you are betraying to (or back to the one you originally betrayed) in order to be accepted within the city walls.<BR>
<BR>
- Until such a time as you are accepted as a citizen of Qeynos or Freeport, you will be an Exile and must only operate out of a new underground location known as Haven.<BR>
<BR>
- Haven does not provide the plush lifestyle of Qeynos or Freeport&ndash;You'll miss out on some of aspects of the city life such as writs, full use of brokers, player housing (apart from Maj'Dul), or city-based rewards.<BR>
<BR>
- Note that all characters, whether they change their class or not, will have their spells set back to the Apprentice I level after betraying.<BR>
<BR>
- Qeynos betrayers should begin their journey with Spockfuddle near the fence in Qeynos Harbor.<BR>
<BR>
- Freeport betrayers should begin their journey with Izzay Meestere in West Freeport.<BR>
<BR>
Player-versus-Player Server Exiles:<BR>
<BR>
- If a player on a PvP server does not belong to either Freeport or Qeynos (i.e. they are in the act of betrayal), they will become an Exile.<BR>
<BR>
- Exiles have their own language: Argot. Communication rules are the same as the other alignments.<BR>
<BR>
- Upon betraying, Exiles receive an unchangeable suffix title of "the Exile."<BR>
<BR>
- Exiles forgo all PvP city rewards once they betray.  <BR>
<BR>
- Lucanic Knights/Royal Antonican Guard faction, as well as infamy/fame and titles are wiped as soon as you betray your city.<BR>
<BR>
- Exiles are open to attack by players regardless of the zone they are in or their level. You will only find protection within the caves of Haven.<BR>
<BR>
- An Exile can attack citizens of Freeport, Qeynos, and even other Exiles.<BR>
<BR>
- While you are encouraged to hone your skills on the battlefield against those of your ranks, you will only receive rewards for killing members of the opposing alignments. These rewards are limited to title modifications when appropriate, experience, and coin/item drops.<BR>
<BR>
- While Haven may seem like a convenient place, there is a price to pay for seclusion. Prices from the merchants are significantly higher, and Exiles do not have access to shared bank slots.<BR>
<BR>
- Exiles wishing to travel to the Sinking Sands will need to sneak into the docks of either Freeport or Qeynos and catch a ride on one of the carpets.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
*** New Consignment System ***<BR>
<BR>
- The new consignment system has arrived!<BR>
<BR>
- You may now list items for sale even if you do not have a home. To do so, speak with your local broker and go to the Sell tab.<BR>
<BR>
- The market window is now broken up into 3 tabs: Buy, Sell, and Sales Log.<BR>
<BR>
- The Buy tab allows you to search for and purchase items.
  * You can perform a simple search by typing in a name in the Search input box.
  * You can perform a more specific search by clicking the Advanced button and selecting various options.
  * Once in the Advanced tab, you can click the Save button to save a custom search, which is accessible via a drop-down box on the main Buy page.
  * To purchase a single item, click the Buy button. You can also buy a specific number of items with the Buy Quantity button or a full stack of an item with the Buy (x) button.
  * Items can be examined via the Examine button or in the right-click context menu.<BR>
<BR>
- The Sell tab allows you to list items for sale.
  * To sell items from this tab, drag a bag or box into a free slot, then drop items within the bag to sell them.
  * If you drag a container that holds items to the market window, all items within will be added to the Sell area.
  * Items will automatically be set with a price, though they will not be up for sale until you list it for sale. This price is the maximum you could possibly get from an NPC merchant, and can be used for quick price reference.
  * You can change the price of an item by clicking Set Price, list it for sale by clicking List Item for Sale, or remove it by clicking Remove Item.
  * You can right click an item and choose Search to find the item if listed by other players.
  * To receive coin from items sold out of a specific bag, click the Take Coin button. Coin will always need to be retrieved through this process.<BR>
<BR>
- The Sales Log will show items you have sold as well as coin gain per session and coin gain from all time.<BR>
<BR>
- More slots will open up in which you can place containers depending on the type of home you own. A better house means more slots that you can sell from.<BR>
<BR>
- Item stacks will count as a single item in terms of the space it takes in your consignment container. For example, if the maximum number of items in a stack is 20, 20 of those items will take up one slot in the container.<BR>
<BR>
- The house vault is now independent of the consignment system, and is used for item storage.<BR>
<BR><BR>

*** Norrathian Exploration ***
 
Nektulos Forest
- Mysterious changes have occurred in Nektulos Forest&ndash;it seems like an evil intent is awakening.
- Strange new creatures have been found stalking the woods and the Freeport Militia has established new outposts to pacify the region.
- Outsiders beware! Though the Militia is doing its best to keep trade routes clear, the malicious nature of the forest is unforgiving to the heedless.
- Nektulos Forest has improved population and less barriers to travel.
 
The Commonlands
- The Bloodskull orcs have regrouped their forces, pulling back to consolidate and build fortifications.
- The Blackshield smugglers have recently stepped up their operations in the Commonlands.
- An unexplained change has overcome the plains near the druid ring. Life is springing up where there was little to speak of before.
- The Commonlands has been revitalized with new sights, new adversaries, and new quests.
- A new solo quest line for subjects of the Overlord can now be found in the Commonlands. Speak with Gerun Pontian near the gates to West Freeport to get started.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
*** New Profession Hats ***<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
- Berserkers, guardians, dirges, and templars can speak with the original Relic and Hooloh hat quest givers to trade for profession hats with a new appearance.
- Once the trade has been made, you cannot trade back to the old appearance.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
*** Zone Access Changes ***<BR>
<BR>
- The following zones no longer require an access quest. For many of the quests, there are new rewards attached in place of the old reward (gaining access to a zone):
  * The Firemyst Gully<BR>
<BR>
  * The Sanctum of Fear<BR>
<BR>
  * Bloodskull Valley: The Excavation Site<BR>
<BR>
  * The Eternal Gorge<BR>
<BR>
  * Miragul's Menagerie<BR>
<BR>
  * Icespire Summit<BR>
<BR>
  * The Forbidden Sepulcher<BR>
<BR>
  * The Trembling Lagoon<BR>
<BR>
  * The Obelisk of Lost Souls<BR>
<BR>
  * The Darkblade Den of Assassins<BR>
<BR>
  * The Serpent's Lair<BR>
<BR>
  * The Murkwater Nook<BR>
<BR>
  * Maiden's Gulch<BR>
<BR>
  * The Vault of Flames<BR>
<BR>
