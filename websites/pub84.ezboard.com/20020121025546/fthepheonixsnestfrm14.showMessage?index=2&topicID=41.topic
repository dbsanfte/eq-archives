One night when I logged on, I saw a bunch on HARs flying across the screen. I assumed it was a joke, so I joined in. Well needless to say, Mcallister got really pissed. For what I do not know. I logged in as Kandaan (I was logged in as Zurlik) and ported to where he was. I said dude, are you really pissed. The response I got was, &quot;why do you mock me&quot;. I said &quot;I do not mock you&quot;. Several other tells/says went totally ignored by Mcallister. Goralis was there and can back me up. After about an hour of trying to get him to explain to me what I did wrong I logged. I chalked that night up to a bad day of playing, no big deal to me. The next time he and I were on, I asked him again, what did I do to offend you. I get the same response, &quot;why do you mock me,&quot; I say this, &quot;I found out from Goralis that HAR is a personal thing to you, I did not know this, I did not wish to offend you in any way. What does HAR mean anyway?&quot;  I get a reply that says this, &quot;HAR is me&quot;.  I ask again what do you mean?  No response from Mcallister. I help him out while he is duelling some guy in EC. No response or acknowledgement that I am even there. I really believe he is unwilling to explain his point to me after numerous attempts to ask him what I did wrong.  Oh, BTW I have ALL conversations on log if anyone wants to see them. I only want to know what I did to offend him and at this point, I do not understand what HAR means to him. All I know is that he had an attitude towards me that seemed like he was better than me. I don't believe anyone is better than any other person on EQ.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub84.ezboard.com/umcallistermuffingiant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>McallisterMuffingiant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/12/01 3:14:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub84.ezboard.com/fthepheonixsnestfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Issue with a member....</span><hr size=1> Misunderstandings do occure at times...I am not better than anyone else.  I am myself, and introvert that I even do not understand at times.  I am hauty and loud at times.  I apologize to anyone that I have ever offended in the past...and hope to mend ties and form friendships to all that I meet in the future.  I am probably one of the most contraversial players on the server and for this I am sad.<br>
I am a phreak and a cold man to you I am sure, yet I am just misunderstood.  Do not hate me I can only ask.  And my deepest apologies go to you Kandaan for anything I have done to offend you, and to the guild for any tarnishing of the name I have done.  Yet for the few bad things I have done the good points of myself and my actions are never pointed out.  I work hard to be the best team player I can be.  When I am in a group, the pops are always taunted within seconds.  I will die for my guild, for my group, for my friends...and even my enemies if they need help getting away from a spawn or creature.  I work hard to be the best guild member I can be.  I have been through alot in the last 8 months and this game is a release for me.  As I was a mean person...hate filled with anger; I have changed tremendously.  I help people I do not know often and show respect to all that work together as team players.  I do not use derogatory statements to adress people...though I occasionally pee on a fallen Kobold or Sarnak.  I am alway eager to help guilds in anyway I can, looted spells and words, plat, grouping, friendship, traveling, selling, trading, and giving.  I do all of these with guildmates from time to time.  I even try to be a positive example to others.  I may come off as harsh or rude...my attitude is scarred and imperfect, my social skills are a negative 250, that is why I avoid talking often.  I seem to always say or do something that offends people.  And HAR is me...it is a long story only shared by close guildmates, friends, and family.  I am proud of who I am now, and work hard to wash the ways of the old Mcallister...yet I seem to stumble on roads less travelled often.  SO I once again apologize for any coarses of action that I have said or done to offend anyone.  I will continue to work on myself as a team player...but HAR will not be understood by many, if you ever hear my explanation for what HAR means it was the right time for you to hear it...and only my closest of allies will EVER hear the meaning.  And if you hear the meaning, please yell HAR back to me to show me that you feel the same way to me as I do of you, just do not say it over and over excessivly...I do take it as an insult.  Sometimes I forget people do not understand what it means, and in that forget to be polite.  Just know...that if you do know the meaning share it with others...and continue to grow.  May the Rising Pheonix pierce the flesh of those who are troubled and wash their souls with the blazing flames of eternity...if you read this I thank you for my time.<br>

<br>
Everytime I log on I have a clean slate of those that might have upset me or made my gaming experience a bit less fun than usual.  This holds equal to you.  But you have never failed to make any encounter with you horrible that I've had.  I strive to see the good in people, but when my group is trained, abandoned, KS'd or slandered I have a hard time seeing good in a person in which has done all this to my groups.  Everytime I log on and see you in zone, whether it seems like it or not (from obvious posts both here and on the VCC R&amp;F board) I really hope too see a more learned Mcallister, but am sorely disappointed everytime.  To me you would really have to go great distances for me to believe one word in your post besides the negative social skills, but really who am I that you would have to prove yourself too!  /shrug<br>
<br>
I hope for the Avatar's sake that both your attitude and rep take a turn for the better. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41221" target="new">Haels</link><BR>

I see you are set in your ways of thinking about me, yet a few bad occurances that happened the first night I was in Sol B about 3 months or 4 months ago, and nothing before nor after where I accidently trained your group cause I didn't know the zone and apologized.  You say you see everyone with a clean slate yet you hold grudges...and wonder if I am more learned when I do not train, nor hold grudges, and am a participating member in a guild...as well as leveling consistantly.  Perhaps you should relize that when people are lower in level that they are not always perfect, they may train once or twice when new in a zone, it happens to the best of them...and that not everyone is always in a good mood when they are trained on... (hince the night you had trained me by accident it was the fourth occurance that night from multiple groups and I was finally sick of it)...though it was not your fault that I acted mad or agressive, you expect humans to be perfect.  And you do hold grudges too long.  I for one am extending friendship to you...this is your chance.  Gain a friend...or consider yourself better than I and keep the rivalry going.<br>
