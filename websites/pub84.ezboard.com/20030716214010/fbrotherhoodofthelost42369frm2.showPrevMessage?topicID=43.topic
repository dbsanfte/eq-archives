Kind of a downer to see that 2 of the most active guild members left without posting on here or somthing. I never heard that they had any thoughts of changing guilds.<br>
Well in case they do decide to come post and stumble across this, hope to see you guys around Norrath <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#581212><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub84.ezboard.com/bbrotherhoodofthelost42369.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rondaric>Rondaric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#F0E68C>(6/23/03 9:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub84.ezboard.com/fbrotherhoodofthelost42369frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hairy and Sirib?!?!?!</span><hr size=1> Well Ted, it came as a surprise to all of us I think. Funny thing is, I had grouped with both of them on that same day and nary a word was said. <br>
<br>
I think I can guess what the reasons were (nothing bad) but it would be nice if one or both of them could at least say goodbye and maybe tell everybody their motives. <br>
<br>
At least we still have the Dok (dont you dare leave us Dok!).<br>

<br>
As long as people are happy then thats important. And i do hope hairy and sirib find happiness in other guilds. At the end of the day EQ is a game, it is a form of entertainment and shouldnt be a hassle. It is a shame they left  (and i dont know why, but im sure they had their reasons)<br>
<br>
However as a side point, if the reason people are leaving is because we are a small guild and hence raids are less, then the solution is to get more peeps and not to leave.....otherwise we become smaller. <br>
<br>
2 very valuable and excellent players have left the guild and we hope that no one else considers this....perhaps we need a recruiting day or something?<br>
<br>

<br>
I just felt i needed to react on this before it becomes a hype)<br>
<br>
I had a few talks with hairy and sirib last week. I think they both felt like having a change for a while in the upper levels. <br>
We have been doing a few raids for 50+ lvls but the lack of tanks kinda spoiled the fun. I understand it is hard to level up in a guild group like that. Sirib preferred fighting together with guildies but we just didnt have the people for it then. So i have no hard feelings for both of them and they are allways welcome back. I just regret it a lot that they both disbanded without letting anyone know including myself.<br>
<br>
It is true that we cancelled the raids and events this month because Leebe and myself had a lot of work taking over the guild from Raznaak. A few new rules have been implemented and that might feel a bit strange as we never had a lot of m in our guild. But they were necessary. By next week we will have most of the hot issues solved and we can concentrate on recruiting and raiding again.<br>
<br>
I think we have great potential in our guild in every level range. But for those that want to level up fast above 55 and do uber raids on planes etc. : this is not the right guild for you ) I will not allow the brotherhood to become uber as i think it is far more important to have a 'family' guild instead of a stressing organisation with 100's of rules.<br>
<br>
I wish Hairy and Sirib lots of good luck. I know they did not leave out of disagreement or anything. btw Doktorib and slimy are still in our guild and i hope to see them online a lot as well.<br>
<br>
Greetz,<br>

<br>
Let me first say BOTL is a very good place to be, lots of friendly ppl, helping each others out, the atmosphere in GuildChat and groups are always warmly, it sure is a pleasure being a part of this.<br>
<br>
But after having being planing Sirib for a very long time I felt borred, always hunting the same mobs over and over again going to the same places. I'm the type of person that likes to do things with ppl I know, so there for I have never really liked pickup raids or simular. <br>
And raiding is the one thing that Sirib was truely missing, hence the 1 and only reason why he left.<br>
<br>
As you properly have all seen the Dok is still around and will remain so, I might not be as much online with him as in the past but he will always be there for you if you need. <br>
<br>
I would like to thank your all for being who you are.<br>
<br>
Sirib 57 Wizard<br>
Doktorib 49 Cleric<br>
