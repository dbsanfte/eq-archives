<br>
I have read all the post about what kind of raiding and looting rules we should use and i see that there is a certain disagreement among us. I have therefor decided that I will post the rules we will us from now on. I will have the privilege of changing these rules in the future if needed. If changes are done in the future i will post them under this subject in this forum.<br>
I also have the privilege to remove RP from any persons that have not behaved in a good way during a raid.<br>
<br>
Introduction<br>
<br>
First of all as i see it we will have two kind of raids:<br>
a) Unofficial raids<br>
b) Official raids<br>
<br>
First we need to distinct between these to forms.- Therefor the rules that makes a raid official are:<br>
<br>
1. It MUST be announced at least 4 days in advance on this forum<br>
2. At least one officer must attend during the whole raid (this is to make sure that the raid points are given out correctly and that all betting with points will be done in the right way).<br>
<br>
All raids that does not live up to both of these criterias will be accounted for as unofficial raids and will therefor not give any raidpoints.<br>
<br>
Rules of Unofficial raids:<br>
<br>
1. Unofficial raids will have no special rules regarding looting. The rules for these raids will just be whatever the persons within the raid have decided on. <br>
<br>
2. Complains about looting from unofficial raids must first be taken to any of the officers and if not decided by them taken to me for my decision. <br>
<br>
3. There is no need for an officer to be present at unofficial raids. <br>
<br>
4. There is no need to announce it in advance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Official raids<br>
<br>
Except for the rules that must be followed to make a raid account as a official raid these rules also apply:<br>
<br>
1. Raidpoints<br>
<br>
1.1 All people that participate in a official raid will receive one (1) raidpoint (RP) per hour rounded up.<br>
<br>
1.2 The reward for showing up at epic fights or single Boss encounters will be 2 RP<br>
<br>
1.3 Arriving late or leaving early on a raid will half the raid points you earn. (With late i mean arriving after the scheduled time at the scheduled meeting place for the raid and with leaving early i mean that you leave before the raid is finished). This is to encourage folks to come in time because there is nothing more frustrating than doing a raid and having all arrive 30 mins to late.<br>
<br>
1.4 In addition to the above there might be special occasions where you are able to obtain RP i e a tournament.<br>
<br>
1.5 RPs must be allocated to the MAIN char ONLY. What I mean is Regardless of what alt is raiding, you have one total account with ALL your RPs earned on ALL raids your alts took part in. ANY of your alts can bid on any item (NBG again though, mustn't forget) using ALL your total RPs. --- For foreigners again: Any Ron can bid using Ron's total RPs pool.<br>
(This is a good point by Firm and makes it easier to organize the RP because of fewer &quot;accounts &quot; with RP)<br>
<br>
2. Looting and spending RP<br>
<br>
2.1 All loot (including money) that is not NO DROP MUST be looted by either the Raid leader or someone that is appointed to looting by him. This person is referred on to as main looter or ML. The ML must be either the RL or an officer.<br>
<br>
2.2 All money earned and all items of less value (that will not be betted RP on) will be given to the guild bank.<br>
<br>
2.3 All NO DROP items that drop and and all other good items will be betted on by using RP (The NO DROP will be betted on during the raid and the other items after the raid).<br>
<br>
2.4 The betting will be a &quot;closed betting&quot;. That means that all persons that can wear the specific item (including the persons alts) are free to bet on it by sending a tell to the ML and saying how many RP they bet. There can only be one round of bettings per person on each item. It is then the MLs responsibility to announce who has the highest bet and what that bet was. <br>
<br>
2.5 In the case of 2 bids the same or more, they will tell each person their number ie 1 and 2, then use a /ran 1 2<br>
command and whoevers number is shown they spend their points and get the loot. (Thanx Hairy for this good point should have missed it if you did not post it).<br>
<br>
2.6 Complains on the betting will be brought up with the ML first, then with the officer on the raid and if not agreed upon with me.<br>
<br>
2.7 The raid leader will have the privilege of reserving one item (the item needs to be posted in the forum in advance and they need to inform the raid about the item they reserved at the start of the raid) that they can wear for themselves but they will then recieve no RP for the raid. If they choose not to reserve any items or the reserved item does not drop they will instead be given double the RP for the raid. (This is to encourage folks to make more raids and wanting to be raidleaders themselves).<br>
<br>
2.8 The RP spent after or during a raid MUST have been earned before the raid. You are not allowed to bet RP that you have earned during the raid or will earn during the raid.<br>
<br>
2.9 If a class specific item drops that only one person in the raid can wear or only one person wants to bet on they will receive it without the loss of RP<br>
<br>
3. The responsibility of the Raid leader<br>
<br>
3.1 The raid leader (RL) is responsible for allocating RP and also noticing spent RP after the raid and informing the raid points manager (RPM) witch is Silvar. There will hopefully be a post on the board with the updated RP all the time.<br>
<br>
3.2 The RL is responsible for overseeing that all members of the raid is taken care of (retrieving corpses and so on)<br>
<br>
3.3 The RL is responsible of taking care of the looting or appointing a person that is responsible for that.<br>
<br>
3.4 Any complains about the way the RL managed the raid will be taken first with the RL and then with any officer and finaly with me.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. The responsibility of the ML<br>
<br>
4.1 The ML is responsible of doing all looting (except No DROP items ) during the raid.<br>
<br>
4.2 The ML is responsible for giving all the money and not good items (that will not be betted on) to the guildbank.<br>
<br>
4.3 The ML is responsible for administrating the bettings on items and for telling the winner and how many RP he/she betted.<br>
<br>
<br>
5. The responsibility of the raid members<br>
<br>
5.1 The raid members MUST follow the instructions of the RL<br>
<br>
5.2 The raid members are free to quite the raid before its finished but all RP earned in the raid will then be halved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well thats about it I think. I have probably forgot a whole bunch of stuff but i will modify and make corrections later.<br>
<br>

<br>
I am not happy with these raid rules, in particular with hidden bidding and the awarding-with-item scheme for raid leader.<br>
<br>
Another one is that new officers are chosen by existing officers themselves. I don't like that either.<br>
<br>
From the above, and a few other points that are not worth mentioning here, I do not see any point of me staying in the guild, taking into account that I don't see myself joining raids so long as these rules apply. And if no raids, then what's the point.<br>
<br>
So please do not have bad memories of your former guild mate )<br>

Actually i hoped you would stay and put your disagreements aside for a while. After all i m sure you noticed ingame that we all are here to group together and help eachother. All guilds have rules and there will allways be a rule you dislike. Is that a reason to drop that guild immediately and say goodbye to all your friends whom you have grouped with you the last week ?<br>
Noone thinks bad of you, Firm. (if you ever had that idea)<br>
<br>
If you really cant stay due to personal principles, i understand and i hope you will find a guild where you feel more comfortable. <br>
<br>
All the best.<br>

The entire post at the forum about RP etc. has been seriously considered during the officers meeting. The publication Raznaak made is the result of this long discussion. It has been voted for unanimously by all officers and the GL btw.<br>
<br>
In due time all bits and pieces will be solved and commented on in future posts. Its a lot of work, it will take time but it will be addressed soon.<br>
Meanwhile all positive comments or ideas are still welcome if they are about matters we havent thought of yet.Theres no point discussing allready set rules however.<br>

<br>
I am sad to hear that Firm/Trooper disagrees so much with theese rules so that he´d like to quite the guild. My intention with theese rules are certainly not to make anyone leave the guild. I however certainly will not hold any hard feelings against anyone that disagrees with the rules or have comments about them.<br>
<br>
I have tried hard to take all the different comments on the forum into account. But my rules are not and where never intended to be a mix of all oppinions. I have instead listened to the different approaches and made rules out from what I think would benefit raiding and the guild.<br>
<br>
But i would like you all to just stop for a second and look back on this fact. Why are we all playing EQ? Why do we want raids? How many raids have we had so far?<br>
<br>
I realy think we all play EQ because its fun. The raiding should also be fun and be special events that can give us all a better sense of teamwork and maybee an oportunity to get some new gear for are chars.<br>
We have not in the past done many raids. We have been a small guild and we have had problems even finding groups of guildies at times. But a new era is comming! We have grown in levels and numbers! We now have the possibility to do raids at least at medium levels. This is fun! This should give us a even better EQ experience! But before we start raiding we have had a long discussion about who should be able to bet on what loot with how many points and soo on. I think we should have rules but lets never forget that wer have not tried them out yet. There might be comments on the rules ive posted and there might be disagreements but lets try to raid first and then do corrections. The reason i posted rules was to bring and end to the discussion and to enable us to do the fun and important stuff witch is raiding!<br>
If anyone feels that they can not accept theese rules I am sad but i cant force folks to stay in guild. But I say concentrate on raiding and have fun not on arguing about the rules because we can change them if it is obvious that they are wrong and we have had NO raids yet to see how they work.<br>
<br>
Let me give u a short not about why i think we need rules:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Someone needs to be in charge of deciding the rules<br>
<br>
As you have seen in the forum as soon as more than one person is in charge of the final decision there will be different approaches to how to do certain things. To minimize the frustration of that i have taken my responsability as the guild leader to do the final rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Rules will minimize conflict between memebers. <br>
<br>
As you have seen in the forum there has been a discussion on what rules for looting and RP there should be. There has mainly been two different approaches on how things should be done. I have read all the posts before posting my rules and i have spent literaly hours twisting and adjusting the different oppinions so get theese rules that ive posted. I am aware that they are nowhere near perfect and that we might need to adjust them after a while. My clear thought is thought that we should make adjustements AFTER we have made a few raids so that we first will have time to see how things work out. (I have also stated this in the beginning of the rules that there might be modifications in the future).<br>
<br>
<br>
As i have said i have read all the posts and i think there has mainly been two big issues that have been discussed. <br>
<br>
* Hidden or open auctions<br>
* Loot/RP for the raid leader<br>
<br>
There has also been some discussions about how many RP should be givven and so on.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hidden vs open auctioning<br>
<br>
I am and have always been a true fan of transparency! However i think that once we all grow and are able to raid more and more difficult places we will encounter more NO DROP loot. The problem with NO DROP loot is that it needs to be actioner right away. Because of that i think a hidden system makes auctioning faster, safer and in some ways more fair (i e the person that makes the last bet knows how much all has betted in an open auction). I am aware with the problem that accusations of cheeting might come up more in a hidden system thats why the ML should always tell the raid who won and how many RP that person spent on the item. In that way all can feel relatively safe that the person that won used more RP than you did in your bet. I cincerely think this is the best system on the paper but as i said before lets raid a bit and if im proven wrong ill have NP with changing it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Loot and RP for the Raid Leader<br>
<br>
I think we all agree we want more raids! To encourage peeps to raid more there should be a bonus as a Raid Leader.<br>
As i see it i would like to give the raidleader something extra for the work he/she has done to research for the raid and the responsabilitys of i e collecting the corpses for the dead raid members.<br>
This would encourage folks to raid more and be RL themselves.<br>
There could be two ways of doing this. Either the RL gets more RP or he gets some other priveliege (like a free loot).<br>
If you consider epic fights with drops i think it is quite clear that if i e Firm started and managed a raid to get a cleric epic drop and Leebe tagged along and had more RP than Firm it would not feel fair that she would be able to get the epic drop over Firm (at least that is what i think). So how would you then manage rules so it does not turn out that way? Well my rules does the following. Firm (the RL) has the advantage of choosing one item for himself (off course he needs to be able to use it, NBG). If Firm (RL) chooses that hed like the epic drop he will automaticly loose all the RP he earned during the raid. This system is good for making folks wanna try epic fights to get drops but it in my opinion does not give the RL to many advantages because they recieve zero RP idf they choose one item.<br>
If the RL does not choose one item (the epic did not drop) they should still be given something extra i think for all the work they did to manage the raid. So in that case they get doubble RP.<br>
<br>
All in all this is a kind of combo between the two different approaches that have been on the forum where one wanted more RP for the RL and the other a free loot.<br>
<br>
All in all i realy have tried to make rules that do 3 things:<br>
<br>
* First and most important that stops the discussion and makes us focus on raiding and have fun!<br>
<br>
* That will make it rewarding to be RL so that many folks will want to start raids (I think raids are fun so i want many raids)<br>
<br>
* Makes all practical stuff on raiding easier  <br>
a) 1 hour= 1 RP, <br>
<br>
b) Punishing peeps who comes to late = raids start at time<br>
<br>
c) Closed auctions = faster auctions, <br>
<br>
d) Telling who won and spent RP = more transparency and you can compare the winning bet with your bet, <br>
<br>
e) RL gets the oportunity to reserve one item = more epic raids<br>
<br>
d) RL gets the oportunity to get 2 times the RP = more raids because more peeps wanna be RL<br>
<br>
etc. <br>
<br>
Anyway. This IS the rules we will start off with just to make sure we start raiding. If they need to be modified or you have comments on them plz tell me about it in the future and ill discuss that with you all.But lets not forget that the important stuff is to start raiding.<br>
Good hunt!<br>

Everquest is about fun, and when that disappears sometimes you can lose sight of the intention of the game. However a guild is a mini-family and we of course want you to be happy......<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (look ive put a nice rolling face just for you!!)<br>

<br>
Firm and Trooper are very valuable members (with plenty of ideas and dedication to making this a better and funnier guild)and i think we should first start raiding and then see how things turn out.<br>
Id hate to have a discussion about how to spend RP on loot break up guild before we even started raiding.<br>
So lets start raiding and see how things move on.<br>

Also made another small correction so that the RL needs to specify what item he reserves in advance of the raid (this is good for epics). If that item drops he/she can have it but will then get zero RP for the raid. If it does not drop or no item is reserved the RL get doubble the RP (2 points an hour). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#7A3412><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub84.ezboard.com/bbrotherhoodofthelost42369.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarkathan@brotherhoodofthelost42369>Sarkathan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#F0E68C>(5/14/03 7:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub84.ezboard.com/fbrotherhoodofthelost42369frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   arggggggg</span><hr size=1> oh man this was not an good day for me .. hearing this <br>
