  <tr><td class='db'><p>What an adventure I had today!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me start with yesterday first.   I woke from my sleep to a message from my good friend Mimaven, saying that he was battling orcs in the hills near Kelethin.  I sent a message back to him telling him that I would like to join him, and I would be there soon.  I gathered my gear and made my way to Faydwer.  When I arrived in Kelethin, I found Mimaven waiting for me near the far lift.  We greeted and I gave him a package to give to another friend of ours, Fdariel, an elven Magician.  Although I hadn’t seen her in a while, I had heard that she had begun adventuring recently, and was in need of some new equipment.  I have gathered whatever I could from the goblins that might be useful to her, and put it in a backpack.  Mimaven promised to give it to her as soon as he saw her again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point we decided to head off to a nearby region that the locals call “Orc Hill”.  The Crushbone Orcs have an encampment there that they use to launch attacks and raids against the Wood Elves.  In fact, the whole area is a battlefield, where adventures launch their own constant attacks against the encampment.  You would think the orcs would give up the hill after losing so many of their number, but I expect the fighting to continue until either the orcs or the elves are wiped out completely.  We followed the dirt trail that led to the hill and within a short time we came across adventurers, both living and dead.  We stopped for a brief second to help out a young elven warrior who was beset by orcs.  Then I cast my Courage spell on her, and we continued on our way.  As we came over the hill, I saw more orcs roaming around the hill than the total sum of all the orcs I have seen in my life.  After casting the Courage spell on both myself and Mimaven, we hefted our weapons and charged into battle.  I have never been in such a large melee before, and I have to admit that it was exhilarating.  I slew at least a dozen myself, and Mimaven fought off two and three Centurions at a time.  At the risk of sounding overconfident, Mimaven and I tore through their ranks like a whirlwind.  And if that wasn’t enough, Attriarck also joined our party, and the three of us ran roughshod over our opponents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through all the fighting, though, I realized that these orcs were not challenging me well enough.  I was using the same attacks and dodges that I had used a hundred times before.  For one to improve, he must be forced to think on his feet and learn new tactics in the art of combat.  This wasn’t happening right now.  After our third run through the camp, I told Mimaven that the RunnyEye Goblins of Butcherblock might provide a greater challenge to our little band.  Attriarck agreed, and we decided to make our way to the mountains to face stronger foes.  On our way to Butcherblock, Mimaven tracked some nearby bandits; we thought the local merchants might appreciate it if we made the roads a little safer.  We swooped in on the unsuspecting elves as they divvied up some no doubt ill-gotten gains.  I fought two on my own, as did Mimaven.  Attriarck stood back and made sure we were well healed, but also found himself in combat as a fifth bandit spied what he was doing.  The bandits fought well, but were in the end overmatched.  After the fight we cleaned up the bodies, and sat around the campfire for a while.  Then both Mimaven and Attriarck had other duties to attend to, and we parted ways.  From there, I headed home to Kaladim, to rest and pray.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next day began as many other days; with a good raid on the goblin warrior camp.  I then made my way to another nearby goblin camp only to find it guarded by a goblin shaman AND a goblin wizard!  Two spellcasters against just me... that’s a gamble.  But I had full faith that Brell would protect me and guide my Axe true, so I decided to take my life into His hands, and attack.  I took on the wizard first, since he could do the most amount of damage in a shorter period of time.  The fight between us must have been spectacular, and I’m sure if anyone watched the fight, they would have been certain I was losing.  I was hit with spell after spell, and I found myself frozen, burned, poisoned, sickened, and fatigued, but in the end I was victorious.  Of course, I was beaten and bruised, not to mention that I was still suffering from various ill effects that were “gifts” from my enemies.  I spent some time recuperating from the battle before dispatching the rest of the horde and collecting the leftover treasure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I headed back to a nearby guardpost and was intending to head home, until I heard that none other than the vile undead creature known as the Skeleton King was persent at the mysterious Chessboard!  I was chomping at the bit to rid the world of such a powerful minion of evil, and I immediately made my way there.  I found a small group on the outskirts already planning the attack.  They happily accepted my request to assist them in their endeavor, and we finished our plans and readied ourselves for the fight ahead.  There were two other spellcasters, a ranger, and me.  We figured the four of us could defeat him in time, although we imagined that any of us could lose our lives during the battle.  We were resolute, however, and we the last of us announced the he was ready, we lept to the battle.  The Skeleton King saw us coming (certainly his foul senses can detect the life from which he feeds), and rushed to meet us.  We met on the edge of the gigantic Chessboard, and the fight ensued.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm not sure if it was the rush of battle, or the fact that we actually were that well organized, but I'm proud to say that the Skeleton King didn't seem to last long.  We had him outnumbered and surrounded, and we picked him apart quickly; which was good, because what attacks he did get off did plenty of damage.  And being a Paladin of Light, I found myself on the recieving end of his vicious spells... probably the main target of his unholy hatred.  The loot was divided up, and we stayed for a while to clean up some of his lesser minions.  I found that the bishops were some of the most difficult... they have the ability to summon skeletal servants of their own!  We did well in destroying the abborations, before we retired to our homes to sell off the loot and rest our weary bodies.  I feel that we greatly contributed to the cause of Good with the destruction of the Skeleton King.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now I go to pray.  I will be making a long journey to Antonica tomorrow, and will need my rest.</p>
