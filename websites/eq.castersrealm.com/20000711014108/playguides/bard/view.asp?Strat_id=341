    Piezo the Half-Elf here,<p><p>
For most classes, the strategy below level 5 is pretty bland. For bards, it's not that much better. First, you will need to equip your newbie piece of trash sword, go get your newbie bard tunic, and go kill stuff. That's pretty standard. No matter in which city you start, you are going to kill these critters for a while. Always loot your kill, and sell as soon as you are full. When you have enough money, go to the bard guild and buy your level 1 song, Chant of Battle. Bards, unlike casters, do not start with any spell/song scrolls at all. <p><p>
Songs are bought and then scribed into your spellbook identically to spells. And then, like spells, the songs need to be "memorized" into your "spell slots" (We bards like to call 'em song slots). One thing you will notice very quickly is how insanely boring memming your songs is. As a bit of comfort, I can tell you that as you gain levels the lower level songs start to be memmed faster, although without meditate it will always take longer than memming spells.<p><p>
Something you may notice is that Chant of Battle says that it is a percussion song. True, a bard does not get the percussion skill until level 5, but Chant of Battle can also be sung (although it doesn't work as well as it does with a drum). <p><p>
Anyway start singing the Chant of Battle by clicking on the icon. You should see a little "Arm" icon showing that you are getting a little boost of strength and dexterity. Leave the song playing and go out and fight some more things. You should always be playing this song when fighting up until level 5. This will not only help a little in the battle but will get your singing skill up. <p><p>
At level two you get the song "Chords of Dissonance". Buy this song when you can, but I suggest while you are still in newbieville, do NOT sing this song. Why? It's an area effect song and will hit anything close to you. So say you are pounding on this bat, and you sing this song for the one or two points of damage that it does, and along comes a wandering guard... the guard hears the song and gets VERY offended and decides that you've done enough singing for a while. Trust me, this song is nice but not until later. Right now you should be worrying about getting a better sword and better armor than worrying about songs.<p><p>
Levels 1-5 are easily obtained in newbie land. Just keep hammering on those bats, rats, snakes, wasps, whatever until you hit level 5. Your songs up to this point aren't really all that exciting.<p><p>
<p><p>
Level 3 you get "Jaxan's Jig of Vigor". This song has a nasty rumor about it that it increases mana regeneration. It does NOT. Do not let anyone believe this as it is a lie. It does increase stamina regeneration, but that is pretty useless at this point to a bard, unless you think the one or two more jumps you can get while singing this song may save you skin. This song is great to sing at warriors in your group later on. But right now, I'd pass it.
<p><p>
Level 4 you get the infamous finding people's corpse song. Every bard I know gets this as soon as possible, not only to make a little cash on the side finding people's stuff, but also because they want to find their own stuff. ;) But bards never die do they? Ha ha. 
<p><p>
Now you're really going to love being a bard.
<p><p>
At level 5, you can scribe the song "Selo's Accellerando". This song will be permanantly memmed in your spell slots. This is our infamous "speed" song. You will also want to go to your guild and train in "percussion". Buy a hand drum. Now, equip your drum in your second melee slot and start playing this song (you will need to have your first melee slot empty to equip an instrument). This will get your percussion skill up, as well as make you run, FAST. Right now it's about the speed of SoW when holding your drum. Later on, you'll be blowing past the shaman/druids with SoW clipping along at the speed of a bard. :)
<p><p>
You can use Selo's without a drum but trust me, you won't want to. This is where you will start to learn weapon switching and using instruments. The best thing to do is to make three hotkeys. Put Melee Weapon 1, Melee Weapon 2, and one Inventory Slot on your hotkeys. Then put a backpack or something in the inventory slot on the hotkey. Keep your weapons and instruments in that backpack. This way, you can quickly open your backpack and equip your instrument or weapon depending on the situation. 
<p><p>
At level 5 you'll need to move beyond newbie land. If you're from Qeynos, go to Qeynos hills or preferably blackburrow. Freeport bards will want to  go to the East Commonlands, and if you're insane enough to start a bard in the massly overcrowded Greater Faydark, go to Orc Hill and work over the orcs a bit. I'd stay solo still at this point. This level seems to have more downtime than any other level, but never fear here comes level 6.
<p><p>
At level 6 you get another song that stays permanantly in your Songlist... Hymn of Restoration. This song works better with a lute, but you can't use a lute until level 8. Still, singing this song will double your hitpoint regeneration rate at this level. Once you get a lute, the hitpoint regeneration will get better. And every few levels or so you start healing even more. I believe at level 8 you will be seeing 6hps per tick, and at level 12 it jumps to 8hps... etc. This will obviously dramitically decrease your downtime, and make you a popular group guy, should you want to group.
<p><p>
At level 7, you will get Jonathan's Whistling Warsong. This is a SELF ONLY song, but it's great. It not only gives you strength but it is a haste song that makes you about 25% faster. Equip a low delay weapon like a Dwarven Axe and watch yourself rip through enemies. This won't help anyone in your party aside from the fact that you'll be a better fighter.
<p><p>
Playing a bard is for the impatient person. The early levels are boring, yes, but after about level 10 or so you will see that there is rarely a time when you aren't doing something. This is the perfect class for the soul who is tired of sitting and waiting for your HPs to go up or tired of staring at the spellbook waiting for your mana to come back. <p><p>
Besides, everyone loves bards. After all....<p>
Bards have the biggest instruments. ;)
