  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p>At this level range (16-28) clerics need to be in Unrest. The
exp is wonderful and so is the loot. Plus, you are very desirable
in groups due to your dual nature of a nuker / healer. If you're
a dwarf, you're only two zones away from your home town. Anyone
you talk to will tell you that Unrest is very very dangerous.
However, it doesn't have to be deadly. Follow my guide and you'll
have a ton of fun...<br>
<br>
First, prepare yourself. Buy several stacks of food and drink.
People are *always* running out of food down here, and you don't
want to make the run down there only to be starving 30 minutes
later. While you're at it, sell / bank any unnecessary items. You
want to be as lean as possible so you can carry a lot of the
heavy loot that will be dropping (bronze armor, ringmail, bronze
weapons, etc).<br>
<br>
Now, zone into Dagnor's cauldron from Butcherblock. Cast Invis.
to Undead on yourself (stops the cauldron skeletons from
attacking you). Remove Spirit of Wolf, if you have it active
(yes, remove). Pick your way through the tunnel, then when it
broadens, veer right and hug the right wall. Proceed very
carefully. There are several steep dropoffs. My own personal
record is falling for 203 points. I shiver to think what would
have happened had I been moving at SoW speed. You can make it
without taking any damage if you're careful. If you need to,
Divine Aura to get down from high points. Soon, you'll see a
goblin camp off to the left of you. Avoid it, as the goblins at
your level are more than a handful. For that matter, while you're
carefully making your way south along the wall, look for goblins
and avoid running into them - they're aggressive, and will attack
you. Once you can't walk south any more, veer to the left and hug
that wall. Very soon you'll see the mouth of the tunnel leading
to Unrest. Walk a ways into it, and Bind yourself there.
Congratulations! You made it through the Cauldron. A bit
terrifying your first time, wasn't it? Those aqua goblin tidal
lords won't scare you so bad the next few dozen times you see
them.<br>
<br>
Now, meditate up to full, and refresh your Invis to Undead. You
might see a bunch of players resting just before the zone to
Unrest. Take the opportunity to heal them up a little, and ask
them if there's a train on the other side. If it seems safe, zone
into the Estate of Unrest. Don't stop now, keep on running until
the tunnel widens. Run to the right and hug the wall in the broad
part of the tunnel. Ok - it's reasonably safe here. Now you can
get your bearings.<br>
<br>
Immediately ahead of you are some fountains, referred to by
players in the zone as, well, 'the fountain'. Just beyond that
are some hedges, and further in, the house. You're invis to
undead - you're pretty safe right now - so hug the right wall.
Run along side it - you'll go between the hedge and the wall,
keep running - now you see a gazebo, run to the left of that
across the field - ok, now you're hugging the wall again, keep
running - now the hedges are to your left, keep running - whew
back at the fountain. That's it, that's the size of the zone.
It's very small. This is good and bad - good in that you don't
have to go far to reach the zone, bad in that there are a ton of
monsters crammed into this tight space.<br>
<br>
Ok, enough talking...let's get fighting, right? At levels 16-18,
I'd advise you to stay out of the House. There are 3 popular pull
spots: to the fountains, to the Gazebo, or to the back wall. The
danger common to all of them is the 'yard trash', the wandering
monsters that are all over the place outside the house. These
include tormented dead, death beetles, and jack o' lanterns,
among others. The undead will all attack you on sight, if you're
not invis that is. The beetle's won't attack you on sight, but if
you're attacking something else, they'll help. So, a common fight
by newbies to the zone goes like this:<br>
<br>
- See a blue con mob, pull it.<br>
- Begin fighting blue mob.<br>
- Another undead sees it and joins it.<br>
- Two beetles join it.<br>
- LOADING PLEASE WAIT....<br>
<br>
How to avoid this mistake? Get a full group of six going, and be
smart. Don't pull a mob if another is in range. Sure, those
beetles are green to you, but if you pull 5, you think you can
handle em? You'd better be sure.<br>
<br>
Ok, so you do 16-18 this way. What's next? Ah - the round room,
aka the 'RR'. This is the big round room on the first floor of
the house. If you walk around to the back wall, you'll see the
round part of the wall - so you know that's where the round room
is, makes sense right? There's a door there. Get a full group
together, do a quick look around for yard trash, then fling the
door open and run in! Hopefully there's not another group there.
If there isn't, most likely there's undead there. Knock them out,
don't let them run. Concentrate on one undead at a time. As a
cleric, your job is to heal. Nuking is something you do when
you're at full mana. Meditate while the fighting is going on. I
have a hotkey for '/gsay Healing %T', so the party knows a heal
is incoming. Stand, hotkey, heal, meditate. Your party will love
you. Make sure you tell them when you start to get low on mana,
and tell them if a mob is on you so they can get it off. If you
have the spell, memorize Cancel magic so you can get rid of Root
spells.<br>
<br>
Send a puller into the hallway to pull the nearest undead.
Pulling undead from Unrest is an art, some are quite good at it.
The general principle is to not pull from upstairs / downstairs.
The key points are the following:<br>
<br>
- Pull the closest undead first.<br>
- Casters (i.e., dry bones) are the primary target in a
multi-monster pull.<br>
- Everyone assists the puller. Put the undead down one at a time.
It's no use having 5 injured undead that are all still hitting
you, when you could have 2 dead monsters and only 3 hitting on
you.<br>
- On pulls where multiple undead come running, heal as normal but
be aware one of the undead will break off and start hitting you.
Just be ready for it.<br>
- If you see any of the 'named' mobs, i.e. the reanimated hand,
the reclusive ghoul magi, the dwarven ghost (yes, I've seen him
in the RR before), or more difficult mobs like hags enter your
camp spot, don't wait. Have the whole group up and bail at once.
It needs to be a coordinated retreat - don't flee and leave your
party behind - but all at once just up and run. Yell 'train to
zone' several times, to warn others. If you don't, you'll
probably find that your faction with PlayersOfEq will decrease.<br>
- The above advice also goes for pulls that are out-of-control.
If you pull six mobs, all run at once, unless you have a really
good enchanter with you.<br>
- No fighting in the hallway! Pull them back into the room.<br>
- When it comes time for you to run, don't forget that handy
Divine Aura. Hit it and start leaping, you'll make it to the zone
more often than not.<br>
<br>
If you get tired of the RR, or if it's already camped, try the
'library'. It's kinda hard to give directions, but if you walk
down the hallway from the RR, then veer left, and left again,
you'll see it. It has one entrance into the front room, with an
adjoining rear room (no door between the door). They'll be some
undead in here, clean em out. Then camp this for a while. The
library is a little more dangerous in that returning trains that
other people pulled will wander by your doorway into the hallway.
Be aware of this problem. Also, if you need to evacuate, you have
a little further to run. Please shout to warn of your train
before you trapse through someone else's camp spot.<br>
<br>
If the worst happens and you do die, invis to undead works
wonders. Don't loot your corpse where you died, drag it using
/corpse - this doesn't negate invis. Take it somewhere safe and
then break invis by slowly recovering your belongings.<br>
<br>
Ok, now what? Well if you're in the low 20's as a group, it's
time to go to the second floor. The 'back room', near the spawn
point for the Magi, is quite nice. Lots of skeletal monks and the
occasional stronger mob - I've seen fungi, werebats, and hags up
there, guess they get lost occasioanlly. Have everyone /assist
the puller!! This is crucial, unless you want your poor enchanter
to have a nervous breakdown. Med to 80% or more between pulls.
Endure magic and fire is good for tanks, for the dry bones. Don't
mess with the little gnome up there, he's quite powerful. Just
concentrate on finding a good, solo undead to fight.<br>
<br>
Once you hit 24 or so with a full group, go get the Hand! Man,
this thing is creepy. It also casts spells, so watch it.<br>
<br>
28+: Well, it's the basement for you. A balanced group is a must.
Good luck.<br>
<br>
The experience in this zone, esp. with a 6 person group, is quite
nice. The loot is very nice for your level. On a typical 3 hour
playing session, I usually leave with 2 bubbles of exp (I earn
more, but deaths subtract), and about 50-70 pp in loot. Small
bronze armor @ 2 pp / ac to PCs, ivories for 5 pp each to
vendors, fine steel for 4.5 pp each to vendors, ringmail for 2 pp
to vendors, lotsa words / runes for 1-2 pp to PCs, darkbone
marrow for 4.5 gp to vendors, grave mold to rogues for their
poisons, jades, ambers, pearls...it adds up quick. Aren't you
glad you made room for all this before you came to Unrest? Don't
be a hog, share the wealth with your group - enjoy this newfound
influx of money.<br>
<br>
Have fun in Unrest. It's a challenging zone that forces you to be
mobile and react to sudden surprises and chaotic battles ...
excellent training for later in your adventuring career.<br>
