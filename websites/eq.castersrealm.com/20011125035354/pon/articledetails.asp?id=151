  <p>Soulfire chapter 1</p>
  </b><font size="2">
  <p>His pack fell first, thrown to the ground without a thought, the supplies
  within would be of little use to a dead man. He ran, stumbled, and clawed his
  way through the forest. The darkness was drawing closer ever closer, its cold
  damp fingers were reaching for him, and he could feel the hunger within those
  claws. A branch caught his silver helm and pulled it from his head, he did not
  stop to look back as he ran. His heart pounded like a battle drum and fear
  choked back the scream he wanted so desperately to let out.<br>
  <br>
  They were behind him he could hear them, the dead knights, fellow knights that
  he had killed, drawing closer on their undead mounts. The darkness of the
  forest responded to their cry and crept closer to him, trying to slow his
  passage. His mind told him he was dead but his knights’ heart would not let
  him give in just yet. Something black and dead sprang up in front of him and
  attacked, he rolled to one side and came up with his holy sword in hand, and
  its blue blade brought a smile to his face. He brought it down across the
  chest of the unholy creature and the creature exploded in the glow of holy
  fire, he ran onward faster as he knew he had ground to make up. Another
  creature jumped out in front of him white and bloodless the vampire stood in
  his way its mouth all pulled back, a foul reeking smell oozed out between its
  white fangs. The knight thrust his holy sword towards the vampire and as the
  blade made its way to the creature’s heart the creature grabbed the blade
  and its holy blue light faded out ever so slowly but surely. The Vampire fell
  to the ground once again dead but now his holy blade lay there also, dead and
  powerless.<br>
  <br>
  He ran onward. Something grabbed at his leg as he ran and one of his metal
  guards fell away. The warmth of blood could be felt, as it ran down to his
  ankle, he did not stop to see the wound. The night sky could still be seen, as
  he looked upward, there were no clouds to block his view of the stars. The
  stars, he knew, he would see for the very last time. His heart began to pound
  even harder threatening to burst out of his chest at any moment. He looked
  back for the first time to see how close his fate was and saw nothing, a
  hysterical giggle escaped his lips and he turned back toward the forest to
  continue running.<br>
  <br>
  He froze no part of his body moved. The dark shadowed figure stood before him
  and spread its arms out beckoning him to an embrace. From within the cloak
  could be seen no form or body, just an endless blackness. A deathly cold
  emanated from within the cloak and rushed toward the knight like a creeping
  fog. He tried to move, but the forest floor had turned into a mass of dead
  burned corpses all of them clutching at his legs and armor. Pain shot through
  his legs as dead fingers found there way into his flesh, the fog moved closer
  and now he could hear voices crying in agony as if the dead souls were in the
  fog itself. The fog crabbed at him and began to slowly move over his body, not
  quickly but slowly almost as if it were caressing his limbs. It snaked its way
  up his legs and wrapped itself around his chest. The dead hands that had held
  him in place suddenly let go and invisible hands within the fog jerked him
  forward and threw him to the ground all at once. An unholy shriek came from
  within the cloak and he could hear the voices of the dead knights coming from
  within. He slid ever closer to the cloak, he grabbed at the dead bodies around
  him trying to find a solid hold to grab onto. The knights’ fingers grew
  bloody as he clawed at the dead trying to live just a little longer. His feet
  began to feel the cold as the tips of his boots began to slip into the
  darkness of the cloak. A partially decomposed knight reached out and grabbed
  at his leg and sank its dead fingers deep into the muscles of his calf, he
  tried to scream, but another knight lurched forward out of the hell pit and
  clawed at his face stopping the scream before it could form.<br>
  <br>
  He could see Ingram his friend, the master wizard who he had learned so much
  from looking at him from the clear night sky, then the others were there also
  looking down at him as if they were trying to say something to him. His pain
  grew and grew, and his body moved deeper into the cloak. Just as he slipped
  into the darkness completely the faces of his friends all turned pale and
  began to decompose. At last the dead fingers which had pierced his face and
  throat withdrew and his lungs let out a final scream.<br>
  <br>
  His head hit the frame of the bunk above his and he could hear someone
  screaming. There were knights around him and Valeron Dushire was standing
  before him. The knight realized it was he who was screaming and stopped. A
  scowl crossed the face of Dushire and he spoke to one of the knights.<br>
  &quot;See that he is rested and well, then bring him before me.&quot; His
  voice was stone cold and matter of fact. The knight he spoke to simply nodded
  and motioned to the others who were gathered around Tyrus Storm.<br>
  <br>
  It was hours later and Tyrus had bathed and put on clean garments. He spent 2
  hours in Morning Prayer and then followed the priest to the small room that
  was Valeron Dushire’s office. He stepped inside and stood at attention
  looking straight ahead at the symbol of Marr that hung over Dushire’s chair.
  Tyrus was accustomed to standing for lengthy periods and had done so with no
  problem during his training, however, standing before Dushire made him very
  uncomfortable not unlike facing his father when being disciplined. Dushire
  looked up from his desk and sighed.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Tyrus do you know why I accepted you here at the Hall of Truth?&quot;
  his hand rested over a prayer book with worn edges and damaged bindings. He
  ran his fingers over the binding as if the conversation was a distraction.
  Tyrus moved his shoulders back and lowered his eyes to meet Dushires’
  &quot;I&quot; he stumbled for words, he wanted to say the right thing but had
  no strength in his voice. &quot;No Sire, I don’t&quot; he hung his head.
  Dushire stood up and moved to the window and looked out across the roofs of
  North Freeport. He clasped his hands behind his back.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Tyrus, I believe in my heart that you have the potential to be an
  outstanding knight&quot; he continued looking out his window. Tyrus could feel
  blood flowing to his face as the words of praise came from Dushire. Tyrus
  shifted on his feet, his ears were now very warm and his heart raced.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Tyrus, your heart is good and you have earned the right to be called a
  Knight of Marr&quot; Dushire turned back toward Tyrus and moved to his desk.
  Tyrus was no spell worker, but even he could hear the next words before they
  were spoken. &quot;But, you have a darkness in you that is from your past, and
  it haunts you. Until it is dealt with your value as a knight here is in
  question.&quot; And so the axe fell, Tyrus wanted to yell and argue his case,
  but he did not say anything, he just stared at the Symbol of Marr over
  Dushire’s desk. &quot;Tyrus you have too many things distracting you. Your
  past for one, we have accepted you and do not hold judgement over you.&quot;
  Dushire sat down in his chair and looked up at Tyrus. &quot;You however seem
  intent on punishing yourself forever, and then there are your friends,
  the.&quot; He paused searching the papers on his desk. &quot;Ah, the Oasis
  Covenant. You surround yourself with all manner of people, they are a
  distraction to your duties here.&quot; He fumbled with the papers on his desk
  and sat back in his chair.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Sir I wont make excuses for my actions, my friends are good people and I
  would die for any one of them, I….&quot; Dushire raised his hand and Tyrus
  stopped mid sentence.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Tyrus I’m not questioning that, even though there are those that think
  I should. I am not punishing you Tyrus rather I am going to suggest you take
  some time off, time away from here to get things in order.&quot; Tyrus eased
  his stance and took a small step toward Dushire’s desk.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;My lord, I do not wish to leave the Knighthood, this is my life, it’s
  all that I have.&quot; His fingers rested on the edge of Dushire’s desk and
  his face grew even more flush. Valeron stood and moved around his desk to face
  Tyrus. His eyes searched the knights’ face and Tyrus thought that for a
  moment the lord’s face softened just a bit.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I have spoken with the priests about these dreams that plague you. How
  often do they haunt you now Knight?&quot; Dushire sat on the corner of his
  desk and waited for the answer. Tyrus felt his heart race at the recollection
  of the nightmares.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;They are regular my lord, ever since I reclaimed Ghoulbane from the
  Froglock Paladin lord.&quot; There was little point in denying what everyone
  knew. His dreams had left him trembling and drenched in sweat almost every
  month. &quot;My lord I swear they do not interfere with my work.&quot; Tyrus
  stood straight up at attention to show he was in control of himself. Dushire
  sighed and crossed his arms.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;It is a Holy Sword you carry Tyrus, a great honor you bring to our Hall
  and to the temple of Marr for returning it to the land of light.&quot; Tyrus
  remembered the day He and the Oasis Covenant crawled out of the depths of the
  Froglock City with Ghoulbane. He knew that this action alone was responsible
  for his friends position of distinction in the hall of truth. &quot;Tyrus!&quot;
  Dushire touched Tyrus’ arm and brought him back to reality. &quot;Tyrus, we
  believe that the sword is the source of these nightmares.&quot; His mind
  reeled how could this be so? &quot;The priests have read in the old texts that
  swords of this kind often require service of those who wield them. We believe
  Ghoulbane is directing you to service.&quot; Tyrus blinked and did not
  respond, he had never heard of such things. &quot;Your dreams, Tyrus contain
  one thing over and over again.&quot; Dushire grew quite and solemn, he lifted
  his head and his eyes locked with Tyrus’<br>
  &quot;Vampires!&quot; Tyrus whispered, he shivered as a wave of cold ran down
  his back. His skinned crawled and he could almost smell the stench of the
  undead lords. Dushire noticed the change in Tyrus and moved back to his chair.
  For a moment he hesitated and then handed Tyrus a sealed envelope.<br>
  &quot;Your knights papers and some special documents from the Hall’s
  archives.&quot; Tyrus took the papers and waited, he could sense there was
  more. &quot;We have heard rumors, legends really, that deep within the forests
  of Lesser Faydark there exists a fallen castle.&quot; Dushire moved to the
  cabinet along the left wall of the military office. He opened the cabinet and
  pulled two more packets out and placed them on the desk before Tyrus. &quot;In
  this packet is all the information we have, vague though it may be. This
  packet contains special papers for your friends.&quot; He looked up at Tyrus.
  Tyrus was shocked and could not speak. A small smile crossed Dushire’s face.
  &quot;These papers grant them status as temporary aids to the Hall of
  Truth&quot; Tyrus reached out and picked up the papers. &quot;You are to
  gather your things and leave when you are ready. You are not to return until
  you and your soul find what they seek, and may Marr watch over you son.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Tyrus sat on his bunk and put on the last of his gear, his friends were
  waiting outside the city for him. Another knight entered the room and placed a
  pack of supplies on the floor and left without saying a word. His heart was
  racing and some small measure of excitement filled him. Tyrus felt a small
  smile find its way to his face, hmm this is different he thought. His fingers
  tingled as he reached for his sword. Normally he would strap it to his side as
  it was not permitted to draw ones sword within the walls of the Hall of Truth,
  but this time Tyrus found his hand drawn to the hilt of Ghoulbane. He grasped
  it firmly, without thought his hand pulled the blade half way out of the
  scabbard. He could see his reflection in the perfect surface of the blade,
  there was a cough to his left and he turned his head to see Sir Allien looking
  at him inquisitively.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;My apologies, I meant no disrespect.&quot; Sir Allien frowned and left
  the barracks closing the door behind him. Tyrus chuckled to himself and looked
  back at Ghoulbane, he froze. Within the perfect blade was the image of a
  beautiful white skinned woman, her hair was shock white and her eyes a glowing
  red. The only feature more shocking was her gleaming white fangs, the fangs of
  a Vampire. In the back of his mind he heard a word, a name, he knew it was
  Ghoulbane who spoke to him. He slid Ghoulbane back into the scabbard and as he
  did a sudden calm came over him. He slung his beloved blade over his shoulder
  and headed out the door.<br>
  <br>
  At the edge of the city just before the common lands, a group of people waited
  for the last member of their party. The commoners may have taken little note
  of them but the animals shied away feeling the raw power that these people
  commanded. &quot;What’s keeping him?&quot; asked the dark clad Northman. He
  looked to his companions and shrugged. The robed human who stood beside the
  Northman smiled, the sunlight did not reflect off of any part of him almost as
  if it did not like him. Which was good, as Samadhi did not like the light
  either.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;He’s probably doing knight stuff, go figure.&quot; Samadhi smiled and
  turned to run a cloth over the shining scythe that he held.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;There he is!&quot; the musical voice came from the beautiful woman in
  Lambent armor. Nyxx pointed toward the south wall of the city. The remaining
  members looked toward where she had pointed. The ageless elf sighed,
  Kelemvor’s floating form riding the small winds as he sat above the desert
  floor suspended only by his will and magic’s.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;About time, I don’t like being this close to cities&quot; Kel, as his
  friends called him, turned back toward the Human Archmage he had been talking
  to and they continued there conversation. A few moments later the knight stood
  before them.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Greetings, hail and well met!&quot; he smiled at the company of people
  and saluted them.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Oh brother, do you ever get tired of that?&quot; said the Northman.
  Tyrus smiled. He paused only long enough to note the feigned pain on the face
  of his friend &quot;Mightyd&quot;. It was a nickname of course but it still
  irked Tyrus that in spite of the years he had traveled with this barbarian
  rogue he could gather nothing more about his friends real name. Most of the
  covenant had taken to calling him just D, which suited him just fine it
  seemed.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Not as long as it bothers you I don’t.&quot; he chuckled at his
  friends and continued greeting them one by one. When the greetings were done
  the Archmage Ingram turned to Tyrus and spoke.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Well? Where are we going today Tyrus?&quot; Tyrus’s face grew cold and
  dark, the scythe wielding human saw that darkness and grinned. ‘There may be
  hope for him yet’ he thought. The wind picked up a bit and the cloak of the
  Archmage began to flap. Tyrus moved closer to the group and spoke, his voice
  did not seem like his own but Ingram was sure it was just the effect of the
  gusting wind.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;What? Say that again!&quot; said Mightyd trying to hear over the
  increasing wind. &quot;Where are we going?&quot; yelled the Northman. Tyrus
  smiled again cupped his hand to his mouth and shouted for the group to hear.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;MISTMOORE!&quot;<br>

  Kelethin, City of the Wood Elves.<br>
  <br>
  The colorfully dressed bard looked up from his desk as the messenger walked
  into the room. The younger bard walked lightly and came to attention as he
  stood before his superior.<br>
  &quot;Sir. We have received word from our agent in the Hall of Truth that Nyxx
  will be on her way here with some members of the Covenant.&quot; The young
  bard presented the decoded song that had been passed to him through the mail.
  The message had taken him only a few minutes to decode and he was still
  excited at the words it contained.<br>
  &quot;Thank you Jardick.&quot; The bard captain took the message and scanned
  it quickly. His face changed and his eyes moved faster as they came to the end
  of the document. Wanar looked up at the younger bard and raised an eyebrow.
  &quot;Has anyone else seen this?&quot; He looked ad Jardick and could see the
  traces of hidden excitement there in his eye. As he awaited Jardick’s
  response he placed the document into the candle flame on his desk and watched
  as the paper vanished to ash.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;No Captain, I followed the protocols and destroyed all the decoding
  sheets and the original message.&quot; Captain Wanar dismissed Jardick and
  reread the letter in his mind. He reached into his desk and pulled the scroll
  that bore Nyxx’s name. Nyxx who’s career was as bright and colorful as a
  precious lambent stone. He drafted a letter of assistance and coded it, he
  then left his office and walked to the mail office and placed the letter
  carefully in the slot that bore Nyxx’s name.<br>
  <br>
  The Elven city of Felwithe<br>
  </p>
  <p>The young elven guard pulled tight the last strap on his freshly polished
  armor. His excitement was evident to all the soldiers around him. Some of the
  older guards smiled and patted him on the shoulder, he looked up and returned
  their smiles. He hastily pulled on his boots and snapped to attention and
  saluted the others in the room. His friends returned the salute and wished him
  a last farewell and good luck. Today was his first day on the battlements. He
  marched proudly toward the station that would for the first time be his. Two
  officers stood in place to greet him and welcome him to the post of the elite
  Koda’vie.<br>
  <br>
  A few minutes later he stood on the battlements of Felwithe a dream come true.
  He was just settling into place when he noticed a lone human sitting on the
  grounds before the city gates. &quot;I don’t mind humans but beggars I
  don’t like one bit&quot; he pointed the human out to the other guards. Even
  through his shining visor the other guards could see his face flush with
  anger. The young soldier turned toward the stairs that lead off the
  battlements and took two steps before he found himself unable to move. The
  Koda’vie Lieutenant had grabbed hold of the new guards armor and held him in
  place. Shock crossed Xanielle’s face.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Are we to allow this beggar to camp in front of our city?&quot; The
  lieutenant did not speak, he simply motioned the soldier toward the edge of
  the battlements.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Koda’vie take another look at the human and learn. Tell me what your
  trained eyes tell you.&quot; He stood back and waited. Xanielle stared at the
  human and calmed himself, a few minutes later he stood back and turned toward
  the lieutenant.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Sir. I see he is not a beggar, he is clean and fit. His clothing is well
  kept and he has only a few small packs about him, more than that I fail to see
  anything unusual Sir.&quot; He stood at attention only now realizing that he
  had missed something. ‘Great my first day and I make a mistake. I am not
  even done with my first guard cycle’ he thought. The lieutenant motioned him
  once again toward the battlement edge.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Xanielle look again at the human, see his muscle structure, see how he
  sits? With no visible motion at all, almost as if he were dead.&quot; The
  young soldier looked again and this time he did see, this human was not like
  the others. &quot;Xanielle he is a monk, more than that he is a Fisthammer
  monk. Had you gone down there weapon drawn to move him, he would have punched
  through your nice shiny armor and pulled out your spine for you to see.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The young guard swallowed hard and moved back to his position. &quot;Who is he
  Sir?&quot; he tried to glance at the monk from his position but looked away
  as, for the first time, the monk looked toward the battlements. &quot;That is
  Ivanan Fisthammer, master monk of the Oasis Covenant. If he wants to sit at
  our city gates, well, we let him. He and his group are known to the Lords and
  have been given special privileges.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  East Commons<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Well this looks good, nobody insight. Give me a minute to
  concentrate.&quot; Ingram Blazestorm gathered himself and focused. The others
  moved closer together and grew silent. Tyrus noticed an evil grin cross
  Kelemvors normally calm youthful face. Tyrus grinned, knowing what was coming
  next. &quot;Agh!, Kel!&quot; Kelemvor stepped back as Samadhi rubbed the soft
  spot in his side that Kel had just poked. Samadhi was about to move when he
  felt the spell start. The ground trembled, the grass started to move as if a
  small breeze was racing about. This was the part Tyrus did not like, as the
  energies harnessed by the master wizard wrapped themselves over his body. He
  could feel the energy crawl across his skin like a million little insects.
  Small pebbles and dirt began to rise off the ground, the grass in the area
  began to twist and swirl like some strange pattern was being drawn on the
  ground. Power seeped from Ingram’s form clearly visible to the eye, blue and
  white balls of power and then it was over.<br>
  <br>
  A moment ago it had been noon, now it was already well into the afternoon as
  they had moved halfway around the world. ‘I am never going to get used to
  that’ thought Tyrus. The others blinked and moved quietly apart, moving into
  the standard fighting formation that was now second nature to them. Padmai and
  Ingram stood closer together and the others formed a triangle of protection.
  Reradan flanked the casters in the group on one side and Tyrus on the other.
  There was a gentle cool breeze moving through the forest, it seemed to whistle
  gently off of the giant spires that were around them. This part of the forest
  was for the most part unused and secluded from the rest of greater faydark.<br>
  <br>
  Mightyd stepped into the shadows of the ancient forest and vanished. Everyone
  knew that he was about and would show himself if needed but for now he was an
  ace they could count on.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I am going to Kelethin. Where are we meeting?&quot; Kel asked the group.
  Tyrus did not turn toward the Druid.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Felwithe, I need to check with the priests on something and see if we
  can access the library.&quot; He stared ahead he felt as if he was being
  watched.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Okay, well I will be there by morning if that’s ok. I have some
  matters that I must attend to.&quot; Kelemvor took a step then turned back to
  the group. He turned toward Reradan and lowered his head, for an instant the
  shadow of a great wolf formed around Kelemvor and his eyes began to glow. Kel
  raised his head and howled, the shadowed form of the wolf leapt from Kel and
  raced across the short distance between he and Reradan. Reradan stood straight
  and took a deep breath as the shadow leapt at his chest exhaling as the wolf
  vanished into him. For a second his eyes glowed also and then the spell was
  completed. Kel turned toward the others and repeated the spell. Each of the
  members thanked Kel and then began to move away from the spires.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Ack! I have been infected with treehugger magic&quot; said Samadhi, he
  smilled and waved good-bye to Kel as he too raced off.<br>
  <br>
  Kel stood next to Nyxx. He turned to her and smiled. Nyxx took a step toward
  him, she reached out and ran her hand down his arm stopping to hold his hand
  for a brief moment. Kel looked up into those beautiful human eyes and once
  again wondered how he could have given himself over to such strong feelings
  for a human. Nyxx smiled at him again, as if she could read his mind and in
  that instant he knew why he loved her. Kel returned the smile for a moment
  then turned toward Kelethin. Nyxx reached out and poked Kel in the side.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Ouch, hey what was that for&quot; he said in mock anger. Nyxx cocked her
  head to one side and grinned at him.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Race ya, slow poke!&quot; Kel let loose a laugh only an elf could laugh
  and chased after the swirling lights that surrounded the love of his life.<br>

  The forest of Greater Feydark</p>
  <p>The two young elves ran flashing through the forest that was their
  homeland. Racing to escape the three Orc centurions that followed them.
  Tanaria had exhausted her mana and was praying in desperation for the vital
  energy to flow back into her being faster. Yen, her mate and constant
  companion, for the last 150 years, was falling behind, slowed by the weight of
  his armor. Tears rolled down her bloody face as she ran; her left arm hung
  lifeless at her side as the wounds that she bore would soon prove fatal and
  she knew it. In desperation, she tossed her great staff to the ground behind
  her and the centurion that was right behind her tripped on it as it tangled
  his feet. She raised her head to the trees and spoke a small prayer of thanks.
  For a moment it appeared that they might survive and get away, then Yen
  tripped as his weak knees gave out. Tanaria kept running for a moment and then
  looked back for a split second, the two centurions were cruel and cunning they
  had quickly grabbed her mate and held him up as the third Orc recovered and
  caught up. Yen struggled, but it was no use, he knew he was done and with his
  last breath he shouted for her to run.<br>
  <br>
  Tanaria stopped for what seemed an eternity compressed into a split second,
  her upper body actually turned a small amount toward home and then her heart
  rallied its last energy and her mind cleared. ‘He is my mate, my soul
  companion’ she thought. In that split second she saw warm memories of the
  last 100 years they had been together, playing and laughing, learning about
  the wonders of Tunare. She could see his face as he had been granted the title
  of &quot;warrior of Tunare&quot; the pride in her heart began to swell. It has
  been said that if you could put all the energy of an entire lifetime into one
  moment you could do miracles, it was a human saying, but one she remembered.
  Tanaria pulled with all her heart and as the second she had been holding onto
  faded she saw the third Orc raise his knife to her soul mates throat. The thin
  line formed across Yen’s neck and he kicked for a second as his life’s
  blood sprayed out and onto the soft floor of the forest. The Orc turned back
  toward her and licked the knife.<br>
  <br>
  Tanaria felt the strength of the next few hundred years of her life that was
  not to be rush into her. She raced at the Orc who had killed her mate and
  raised an arm as she began a prayer of destruction, one to smite him to the
  ground in vengeance. Energy arced over her shoulder and ran down her arm, she
  felt for a moment like she had never felt before and she saw fear in the
  Orc’s eyes, then he smiled. The fourth orc stepped out from behind the tree
  as she passed and slammed the hammer into her ribs crushing most of them and
  taking her feet out from under her. The bolt of energy slammed into the canopy
  of the forest and exploded with a massive display of light and sparks. The
  orcs dragged her still conscious body and dropped it next to the corpse of her
  mate. Her eyes opened and she could see Yens face next to her, this is how
  they had spent life and this is how she would meet death, beside him. She
  could feel life slipping away slowly, she faded in and out of consciousness
  and wondered what the orcs were waiting for, why did they not kill her and
  then realization filled her, she prayed for Tunare to take her home now. The
  Lead orc reached toward her and grunted as he tore away her garments and knelt
  down beside her.<br>
  <br>
  Unable to move Tanaria wept as the orc ran his hands across her dying form, he
  paused and pushed a finger into her ribs and laughed as she let out a scream
  of agony. She raised her head just a bit and spat in his face, she hopped it
  would enrage him enough to kill her and end this. The orc centurion stood and
  kicked her hard in the left shoulder and she saw white and knew agony again.
  When she returned to consciousness she could see that there were more orcs
  than before ten or more she could not be sure. The orc she had spat at the one
  who killed Yen grabbed her by the hair and pulled her up a little. &quot;Good
  many good you are awake,&quot; he said in very poor common. She looked down to
  see her bare chest now caked in drying blood, she was barely able to breath
  and knew that It would only be a few more minutes before darkness took her.
  &quot;Me want you see heart from you as me kill you good, Ha aha ha&quot; the
  orc reached down and picked up the knife he had used to kill Yen and put the
  point on her breast.<br>
  <br>
  Tanaria was ready to see Tunare, but tried with her last strength to look
  brave and stare at the orc. Suddenly his smile vanished his skin began to peel
  back, there was no blood no scream he just fell back onto the ground a
  lifeless skeleton, sparks of energy ran across the bones and the other orcs
  screamed and jumped back. Death had come and it stood near the edge of the
  camp it carried a scythe that gleamed with unholy power, beside the dark form
  stood an undead warrior with two swords. The orcs stood stunned for a split
  second then all hell broke loose.<br>
  <br>
  His pet cut down two orcs that ran past Samadhi, the slashes were vicious and
  their entrails were spilled out onto the forest floor. The pet did not move to
  finish them off rather leaving them to lay in their own blood and guts.
  Another orc ran into an unseen sword only to see its attacker become visible
  as the glowing blue blade was withdrawn from its stomach. The human knight
  locked eyes with Tanaria for just an instant and then he turned to the Orc’s
  and screamed in pure rage, he began cutting his way toward her. One of the
  larger orcs moved toward her but was intercepted by a huge man in all black
  armor, his blades moved with lighting speed and the Orc lay lifeless without
  even a sound. Another orc ran up behind the man and raised a wicked looking
  pick, Tanaria was desperate to warn him, but could not speak. The barbarian
  did not look back he simply flipped the rapier like weapon in his hand and
  thrust backwards with it, the rapier blade entered the Orc’s chest just
  below the sternum and penetrated his lungs and came to rest in his heart he
  fell dead. Spinning again, Mightyd sliced out and crouched all at once, both
  weapons going in separate directions. Two more orcs fell dead. Mightyd took a
  split second to survey the carnage, he saw that there were still a good many
  orcs left. ‘This must have been a hunting party from Crushbone’ he
  thought. The orcs were trying to rally and gather for a concentrated assault.
  He could see Reradan cutting his way toward the tree where the two Elves lay,
  he was covered in blood, but Mightyd smiled knowing that it was not
  Reradan’s blood. The orcs were being herded toward the enemies they had not
  even seen yet. An almost evil grin came across Mightyd’s face. Samadhi,
  Reradan, Tyrus, and he were moving in one direction pushing the orcs toward
  certain doom.<br>
  <br>
  Reradan was moving closer to Tyrus. The orcs were beginning to fall back a
  bit. Reradan watched as Tyrus pulled off his helm and let it fall to the
  ground, ‘what the hell is he doing’ he thought. Tyrus let out a howl and
  beckoned the orcs toward him. ‘Damn paladins need to learn a little
  discipline, can’t go off like that in combat. I’m gonna have to talk to
  that boy.’ Reradan knew that Tyrus was middle aged for a human but still a
  child by Elven standards and he hoped that with age he would learn. Tyrus
  screamed again taunting the orcs to fight him. He dropped his shield and
  sheathed his holy sword and pulled a large two-handed black sword from his
  back. The four that he had been closest moved toward him and further away from
  the tree where the elves lay. Reradan shook his head as he decapitated another
  orc with little more than a thought. ‘well he has style… for a human
  anyhow’ Reradan noted that the bulk of the orcs had now moved past the tree
  that was the marker for this combat maneuver. A small sigh escaped from
  Reradan ‘they’re never gonna know what hit them’.<br>
  <br>
  Samadhi nodded to Reradan having noticed that the marker had been reached. To
  the left of the tree stood Samadhi, his pet and Mightyd. To the right moved
  Reradan, the orcs near him now falling back in fear. This elven warrior in
  blue wielding two weapons was not even scratched. They had never encountered
  such things, save in there orc stories of ‘the elvish monsters of old’.
  Only a few orcs were in front of the tree and Tyrus was in the process of
  dispatching them. The last one lowered its weapon and Tyrus stopped his
  attack, he walked past the orc and rushed towards the tree. As Tyrus passed,
  the orc raised its weapon towards his back. Tyrus Storm snapped his head back
  toward the orc and shouted a holy word and the orc was blasted with holy
  magic, its body froze as red bands of energy coiled around it stunning it.
  &quot;I offered you quarter, you betrayed it.&quot; He said, then ran the orc
  through. Tyrus let his sword go and the orc fell hard to the ground the long
  black blade still protruding from his chest. Tyrus ran the last few steps to
  the tree and knelt down beside the dying female. The orcs had now backed up
  well past the tree and were moving a little faster, a few of the centurions
  noticed the quiet smiles on there attackers faces and yelled to there others
  to be wary.<br>
  <br>
  It was too late. Ingram and Padmai stood up from where they had been sitting
  and stepped forward. Ingram pulled back the cowl on his robe and took a deep
  breath. His intellect knew that this must be done, but part of him hated when
  the knowledge and wisdom he had massed was used this way. Padmai stood beside
  him and raised her holy symbol forward. The orcs turned, en masse, and many
  knowing there fate tried to run but came up short seeing that the other
  attackers had now moved into positions to surround them. The smaller orcs in
  the middle began to howl, the larger ones gave orders, and none were being
  obeyed.<br>
  <br>
  Padmai began to chant a prayer and her form was filled with light, each ball
  of light seemed to have a mind of its own. The little dances of light came
  rushing out of her holy symbol and flittered about her, dancing slowly up into
  the air over the forest adding an eerie light to the darkness. Ingram had all
  but finished the spell he was crafting, before his minds eye he saw symbols
  and words they danced about pulling at energy that was not meant for the
  mortal world. Even this far back Reradan could feel the energy on his skin and
  then it stopped. Ingram smiled and let it go, the burst of energy incinerated
  20 orcs at once they did not scream they only stood there with a confused look
  on there faces just before they vanished. The others broke running in any
  direction, Padmai’s spell let loose and the dancers of light descended on
  the remaining orcs and holy fire like a shock wave ran through them. Many fell
  dead instantly the others died horribly as the fire burned them alive from the
  inside out. Ingram turned and fired again, power coming faster now from each
  hand. The energy danced across the mass of orcs and bodies exploded as they
  were unable to contain that much power. Padmai moved forward and as her eyes
  settled on an orc it ignited in holy fire. Seconds later it was quiet save for
  a few of the larger more powerful orcs who, not having been killed outright,
  lay dying.<br>
  <br>
  Tyrus cradled the female elf’s head in his lap having removed his cloak and
  covering her form. He smiled down at her and tears ran down his face, as he
  seemed to feel her pain. Tanaria tried to speak but was unable to. Tyrus
  brushed her bloody hair out of her face and caressed her cheek. &quot;Hush
  don’t try to speak, your going to be ok. I will not let you die.&quot; A
  small smile was all she could manage. This human was kind of face but she knew
  it was over.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Tyrus?&quot; it was Padmai who had moved to meet them, she stood behind
  him and looked over his shoulder. Tyrus did not look away from Tanaria’s
  face he just nodded slightly to the body of Yen.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Padmai I know what it means to you to do this, but please can you help
  him?&quot; Padmai rested a hand on his shoulder for a second and then moved
  toward Yens corpse. Tanaria felt the warm human tears fall on her face and
  then felt a heat from his hand that she did not expect. Tyrus placed his hand
  on her forehead. &quot;M’lady this day you shall not die&quot; it sounded
  like a command and a prayer all at once. Tanaria saw lights racing toward her,
  her eyes were closed and the light could still be seen and the warmth from the
  Knights hand was now getting much hotter. She felt energy flowing from his
  hand and from his heart rushing toward her. Her body grew numb for a second
  and then she felt her lungs fill with air. Tanaria could hear singing,
  multitudes singing a worship song to Marr. Her heart filled with wonder and
  with strength she knew without looking that all her wounds were gone, the
  music was beautiful and made her want to laugh. Suddenly it was gone and she
  was whole, there were no aches no pain and not one mark from the wounds she
  had felt. She sat up and held the cloak around her and in an instant her heart
  was again filled with pain and anguish, her beloved Yen was still dead.<br>
  <br>
  Padmai knelt beside him and gathered power for the prayer that would take all
  her strength to cast. The holy symbols lay on a small cloth at her feet and
  the breads and blessed water were in her hands. Padmai wiped a small patch of
  blood away from the face of the Elf and traced a symbol on it. Feeling the
  power reach its peak in her, Padmai spoke the words calling the spirit of the
  fallen back to the world of mortals. A light with no source formed over the
  body of Yen, the grass where he lay began to stand straight up. Buttercups
  began to sprout from the ground as if seeking the light. The others drew as
  close as they dared, save for Samadhi who moved away to stand by the tree.
  Tyrus lifted Tanaria up and held her close making sure the cloak was firmly
  around her. Tanaria could not speak, did not want to move or breathe. Tanaria
  was barley able to maintain her footing as her knees grew weak with hope not
  hoped for.<br>
  <br>
  The trees began to sway and creak, leaves and some pollen began to fall. The
  light from Yens body began to radiate so that one could hardly look right at
  it, but so strong was the draw that Tanaria could not look away. Tears began
  to roll down her face, a wind wiped through the trees. Colors that one would
  not normally see at this time of the year began to show all over the forest.
  The light of life was now so strong in the area that the ground itself opened
  and swallowed the dead orcs as if their presence was an affront. Tyrus looked
  at Tanaria and smiled, it was a smile of youth and warmth. Tanaria noticed
  that there was a glow now coming from within The Knights armor just over his
  heart, she could almost make out a symbol of some kind, its glow now so
  bright. Tanaria now saw the light reach out and form rays that raced outward
  from her mate’s body, one ray stopped for an instant in mid air and then the
  huge human came suddenly into view. Mightyd had seen this a few times before
  but was still unable to suppress the smiles that the pure light brought to his
  face, he looked at Tanaria and smiled.<br>
  <br>
  All the light shot upward like a bolt straight up into the sky and was gone,
  the forest plunged back into darkness. For an instant nothing happened, but
  Tanaria noticed that the others were all looking up, except the one named
  Padmai she still looked down and had a hand resting on Yens chest. Tanaria
  looked up just in time to see a perfect circle open in the sky, and a huge
  beam of light race downward. The light burst into Padmai like a sword being
  thrust into the ground. The light paused for only a moment then exploded from
  her and straight into the corpse of Yen. Yen sat straight up and screamed, not
  a scream of pain, but almost a birth scream. Tanaria fell from Tyrus Storm’s
  arms and threw herself on her mate, Tyrus rushed forward and covered them with
  his cloak and then stood back. The others were standing nearby and had now
  begun moving back a bit. Ingram lifted Padmai from the ground and helped her
  to a spot a short distance away where Reradan was also resting. Everyone had
  smiles on their faces, and Padmai could be seen wiping tears of joy out of her
  face. This took more out of her than they liked to see, but the reward was
  worth it.<br>
  <br>
  He held the small magic mirror closer to his face trying to see more for a
  moment, the knight and his party soon faded from view. He placed the mirror
  gently back in the small silk lined box and closed the lid. His massive form
  fit comfortably in the gold inlayed chair, the light from the candelabra
  danced across his armor and he smiled. The Dark elf that stood to his left
  moved forward and removed the little box from the table. The Troll took a deep
  breath and smiled again, his face twisted with evil intent and glee.
  &quot;Master? How may I serve thee&quot; the naked dark elf that had been
  summoned stood before the troll and gazed at him with a mindless awe in her
  soulless eyes. Xicotl turned to her and placed his massive hand on her face,
  his claw ran across her cheek and left a bloodline as it cut deep into her
  face.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Will you die slowly for me and scream for me as I kill you my
  lovely?&quot; his grin revealed teeth that did not seem to have a direction in
  common, a broken crag of spikes. The dark elf wiped her own blood off her face
  and with two delicate fingers ran the blood across his teeth and lips.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Master I will die well and may my screams fill your heart&quot; she
  leaned forward and kissed him, biting his lip hard enough to draw blood. He
  raised a massive hand and the butler moved forward. His face all white and
  gaunt Xicotl motioned to the dark elf female and she withdrew from the room.
  Once the door had closed Xicotl turned to the butler pulled him close, his
  lips almost touching the vampires ear.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;You will prepare the castle.&quot; He said softly and with pure hate in
  each word. &quot;We are having guests soon&quot; he began to laugh, a laugh
  that quickly turned into a maniacal cackle.<br>
  <br>

  Nyxx took a deep breath as she stepped onto the lift that would take her high
  into the tree city. A smile crossed her face and the scent brought back many
  memories, some good and others bad. The unmistakable scent of magic and nature
  was all over the sacred tree. As the platform rose into the air, Nyxx spun
  around and stretched her arms out as if she would turn into a bird and leap
  off the platform, so giddy was she with the energy that she felt. The magic
  filled her, and she could no longer contain it, Nyxx took a deep breath and
  let out a pure and beautiful sound, it left her throat like a gust of morning
  mist and began to soar upward as it took form. The melody turned into a song
  that had physical form, the air began to sparkle and shine as it twisted and
  danced. It shot off in multiple directions one strand wrapped itself around
  the trunk of Kelethin another flittered about and raced ahead of the platform,
  finding its way to the main level much to the surprise and joy of the elves
  who were nearby.<br>
  <br>
  The lift was nearing the main level of the city, and already elves had
  gathered as the sparkling notes of the bard’s song danced about. Some of the
  young elf children were running about trying to catch the little fairy like
  sparkles. Nyxx continued that song letting it take over and pulse through her
  body. The main platform was now nearing eye level and she could see the feet
  of many elves as they stood and listened to the song, Nyxx smiled and did a
  little bow at the end of the song. The bard stepped of the lift and ended the
  song to the applause of many. There was an exaggerated cough to her left and
  she turned to face it.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Hello Love. I win.&quot; A large smile crossed the face of Kelemvor as
  he moved toward his love. He chuckled and opened his arms beckoning her to
  him. She moved toward him with crossed arms and a frown on her face in feigned
  anger. Kel wrapped his arms around her and kissed her perfect lips.<br>
  &quot;You sir, cheated!&quot; Nyxx exclaimed. Nyxx dropped her arms and poked
  him playfully in the ribs. Kel grunted and covered the spot she had jabbed.<br>
  &quot;Of course I did, how else was I supposed to catch you? Besides I was
  almost entranced running behind you like that, hehe..I damn near ran into a
  tree following you.&quot; Kel chuckled and took her hand. That perfect hand
  that was so soft, so perfect and yet so strong. Kel wondered how anyone could
  be more perfect than his love. Kel move toward the bard’s guild and stopped
  as he felt his love’s perfect hand tighten. He turned and looked into her
  eyes and saw discomfort, she would not meet his gaze.<br>
  &quot;Nyxx? What’s wrong?&quot; he leaned forward and peered into her eyes
  making her meet his gaze. She looked up and sighed.<br>
  &quot;I have to go alone.&quot; Kel raised an eyebrow and stepped back. A
  small frown found its way to his normally youthful face and then it vanished,
  replaced by a boyish smile. With flourish and style Kel bowed before Nyxx and
  bent his knee before her.<br>
  &quot;As the lady wishes&quot; he stood and placed the back of his hand on his
  forehead and looked off into the morning light. &quot;Only know m’lady that
  if your off to a rendezvous with another I shall be broken hearted.&quot; Kel
  stepped back smiled and did a snappy turn, almost a little dance, and began to
  run, Nyxx could see little bursts of magic form around his feet. Kel picked up
  speed and to the shock of passing elves dashed straight off the edge of the
  main level of the city some 100 feet up in the air. Nyxx shook her head and
  crossed her arms but did not move. A few moments later Kelemvor’s head
  reappeared just above the platform.<br>
  &quot;Hey aren’t you going to make sure I’m ok?&quot; he smiled and waved
  a little wave and sank back out of sight. Nyxx smiled and let out a little
  chuckle as she turned toward her guild.<br>
  <br>
  The sound of soldiers moving down from the ramparts stirred Ivanan’s mind
  and he opened his rested eyes and pulled himself slowly out of the meditative
  trance he had been in for the last few hours. The guards were rushing forward
  right past his position and the second watch was moving into position to fill
  the ramparts. The monk launched himself upright and moved quietly behind the
  soldiers and followed them to the tree line.<br>
  <br>
  The Koda’vie lieutenant barked orders and the soldiers moved to form a
  protective circle around the people moving out of the trees. Xanielle’s
  heart pounded as he saw the first person come into view, An elven warrior all
  in dust blue strode forward in formation with a Human who had his arm wrapped
  about the form of a young elf. Xanielle wanted to rush forward and remove the
  human’s hand from the elf maiden at his side, his heart ached when he saw
  her condition, she was covered in blood and her clothes were tattered. She had
  wrapped about her only a cloak, then Xanielle noticed that her face was full
  of joy and happiness, he frowned remembering his earlier mistakes and looked
  closer not wanting to repeat the same one. Beside the Elf maiden was a young
  warrior also in tattered armor and covered in blood his hand firmly grasping
  the elven maiden who he walked beside. The young male elf’s face was blank,
  almost like a person just coming out of a long dream. The lieutenant ordered
  guard formation and Xanielle moved up and took position beside the group.
  Padmai smiled at the new Koda’vie and recognition crossed his face and it
  flushed. Beside Padmai strode a human dressed in the robes of the magi he was
  looking to the tree line and then towards the beautiful city that lay before
  them. Xanielle’s jaw went slack as recognition set in. The elven warrior was
  none other than Captain Reradan Morzarek of the elven bloodguard. Quietly and
  very casually behind them walked Mightyd and Samadhi engrossed in a
  conversation, Xanielle thought it sounded like an argument but the two were
  smiling.<br>
  <br>
  The party moved in through the city gates and moved to meet the Captain that
  stood waiting in the courtyard. Ivanan slipped into their ranks and was
  greeted by Samadhi and Mightyd.<br>
  &quot;Hmm, I see you ran into some trouble?&quot; questioned the monk, his
  voice did not change in pitch or tone. Mightyd turned to Sam and cocked his
  head to one side.<br>
  &quot;Trouble? Whatever gave you that idea&quot; Mightyd smiled and shrugged.
  Sam turned to Ivanan and began stroking his goatee.<br>
  &quot;You monks seem preoccupied with battles and mighty deeds, aren’t you
  supposed to be stoic and calm at all times?&quot; Ivanan shook his head and
  sighed, deep inside he wondered if these two would ever stop having fun with
  him and then he quietly hoped that they would not.<br>
  <br>
  The party had moved fully into the courtyard and was now met by castle staff
  who took the two young elves away to be looked after. As the two moved toward
  the castle doors Tanaria turned and yelled back to the party.<br>
  &quot;Tunare bless you! If you ever need us, we will be there for you all of
  you!&quot; she waved and smiled and tears could be plainly seen to run down
  her face. The group waved to the young elves and then turned back to the
  Captain. A full flight of guards had moved into formation around the party and
  were all standing at attention as they awaited orders from the captain.
  Reradan cleared his throat and nudged Tyrus in the shoulder. Tyrus turned his
  head slightly.<br>
  &quot;Ty give him the damn papers and lets go get cleaned up, I don’t want
  to stand here smelling like this all day if we can avoid it.&quot; The
  Koda’vie captain stiffened and stepped forward.<br>
  &quot;Thank you for bringing the young ones to us, we will care for them and
  see they are escorted back to there home. Now, if I may be so bold as to ask,
  who you are, and what papers?&quot; Tyrus stepped forward and threw back his
  shoulders, in one swift motion he removed his helmet and stuck it under his
  arm. He then withdrew the papers he had been given from the scroll tube slung
  at his side.<br>
  &quot;I am Tyrus Storm, and we are the Oasis Covenant! Here are my papers from
  the Hall of Truth instructing you to offer any assistance you can.&quot; Sam
  cursed and pulled some gold coins out of his purse and handed them to Mightyd
  as he counted them. The large barbarian chuckled softly as he accepted the
  coins.<br>
  &quot;Told you he would, I have known him forever and he is paladin through
  and through hehe&quot; oblivious to the eyes watching them the pair finished
  counting coins and arguing.<br>
  &quot;Oh sure! But I would have bet 50 plat he would have mellowed a bit by
  now, jeez paladins, and all the pomp..blah blah..sheesh.&quot; Sam slapped the
  last of the coins into the barbarian’s hands and looked up. All the soldiers
  and the captain were staring at him. Tyrus face was red and his mouth was open
  slightly. Sam beamed a full wide smile and then began marveling at the nice
  courtyard tiles.<br>
  <br>
  The captain took the papers from Tyrus and scanned them, a frown crossed his
  face and he pushed them back to Tyrus. Tyrus took the papers and rolled them
  back up and slid them back into the scroll tube.<br>
  &quot;Very well, you will be quartered in the guest section of the castle and
  I will have the scribes bring you the books you need. But make sure you
  don’t wander&quot; the captain gestured and the guard detachment dispersed.
  Mightyd stepped forward and tugged on Ty’s shoulder.<br>
  &quot;Hey, where is the knights welcome and the gracious hosts you spoke
  of?&quot; Mightyd chuckled and went back to talking with Sam. Padmai walked
  past Ty as he stood there in shock and patted him on the shoulder as she
  headed off to the temple. Ingram sighed heavily.<br>
  &quot;One day they will both grow up, I think, well on second thought..&quot;
  Ingram left Ty and followed the others into the castle. Ivanan stopped as if
  he was going to say something, he opened his mouth and paused shook his head
  and followed after Ingram.<br>
  <br>
  Kel was starting to get worried, it had been two full days that Nyxx had been
  inside her guild and he had was getting ready to march in and demand to see
  her when she walked out. Nyxx walked slowly and the song that seemed to be
  part of her was not there. She had with her a satchel of papers and a large
  scroll tube. Kel rushed to her side.<br>
  &quot;Nyxx? What’s wrong?&quot; he did not get an answer, rather she turned
  to him and embraced him and began to cry. The tears started slowly and then
  turned into large heavy sobs. Kel stood there outside the Bard guild and the
  world disappeared, he had never seen his love like this before. Anger filled
  him and he wanted to know, wanted to question her and find out what caused her
  such pain, but he just held her and waited until the sobs slowly faded.<br>
  &quot;I’m sorry Kel but I can’t explain yet, we need to find the others.
  Please lets go.&quot; Kel did not say a word he just held her hand and turned
  toward the platform.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Nothing, Damn!&quot; Tyrus slammed the book cover shut and Ingram jumped
  and a half cast spell fizzled and shot sparks over the table. Reradan sat bolt
  upright, cast a dirty look at Ty and went back to napping in the corner.<br>
  &quot;Sorry Ingram, its just we have been at this for two days and
  nothing.&quot; Tyrus stood up and put both hands on his hips and leaned back
  trying to stretch the muscles that ached so. He rubbed his neck and sat back
  down. Ingram closed the book he had been sleeping on and rubbed the lines off
  his face.<br>
  &quot;Ty if its not here its not here.&quot; Ingram blinked and groaned he
  looked at the table and the titles of the books blurred before his eyes.<br>
  &quot;Ty we have been at this too long, we need to rest and start fresh, I’m
  sorry.&quot; He walked around the table and toward the door. Tyrus was leaning
  on the table with both hands his head hung with both exhaustion and dismay.
  Ingram reached for the door handle and pulled it open. Nyxx gave him a weak
  smile.<br>
  &quot;Nyxx! You have scared me to death.&quot; Ingram stepped back holding his
  chest. Kel stepped into the room behind Nyxx and chuckled<br>
  &quot;Not to worry old man, I’m sure Padmai could bring you back.&quot; Kel
  smiled and plunked himself down in one of the big chairs in the room. Nyxx
  moved to the table and gently put the satchel she carried on it.<br>
  &quot;Well you two got here just in time, Ingram and I are dead tired we need
  you to keep going through this mess&quot; Ty gestured to the dozen large books
  on the table.<br>
  &quot;And see if you can find what we could not.&quot; Ty moved to the bed and
  fell down on it. Kel stood up and moved over to the table as he began munching
  on an apple that he seemed to pluck out of the air. He nudged one of the books
  and flipped a couple of pages like you would flick at the corpse of a dead
  animal.<br>
  &quot;Um, what are we looking for?&quot; Kel asked, his word muffled by the
  large chunk of apple he was working on. Tyrus sat up on the bed and blinked a
  bit.<br>
  &quot;Well, Kel we are looking for any information about a castle.&quot; He
  began to stand up again and move back to the table, he moved like a man whose
  feet were incased in rock, slow and lumbering. Nyxx shifted uncomfortably. Kel
  arched an eyebrow and pulled a chair out for Ty and gestured him to it.<br>
  &quot;Yeah the one you mentioned, ah Mistmoore, right?&quot; Ty sat down and
  turned slightly to face Kel.<br>
  &quot;That’s right Kel, Castle Mistmoore.&quot; Mightyd, Sam and Ivanan
  entered the room, D and Sam carried large platters of food and Ivanan carried
  a small keg and some mugs.<br>
  &quot;Well you two bookworms have any luck?&quot; said Mightyd as he shook
  Kel’s hand and gave Nyxx a bear hug. The food platters and mugs were put
  down on the second table in the room. Kel turned back to Tyrus.<br>
  &quot;Hey wait a minute, what’s so special about this castle anyway?&quot;
  Kel noticed Tyrus, Ingram and Nyxx all stiffen. Ty shot a questioning look at
  Ingram and Ingram shrugged.<br>
  &quot;Vampires, it’s inhabited by vampires.&quot; Nyxx said quietly and much
  to the shock of both Ingram and Tyrus.<br>
  &quot;And worse, there are souls trapped there, damned by evil and unable to
  escape.&quot; Kel could see that Nyxx was beginning to shake and the others
  noticed also. Kel moved to her side and put an arm around her. Tyrus mumbled
  something to Ingram just as Padmai entered the room.<br>
  &quot;That sounds pleasant, is that where we are going to rescue people from a
  castle, sorry I did not catch all of that.&quot; Padmai moved to a chair by
  the fireplace.<br>
  &quot;No, we can’t help them, the only thing that will end there suffering
  is death, and we must end there suffering.&quot; Nyxx pulled the cap off the
  large scroll case she carried. Tyrus leaned across the table towards Nyxx.<br>
  &quot;How, do you know all this?&quot; he paused, but she did not answer, she
  just continued pulling a large scroll out of the case.<br>
  &quot;Nyxx, how do you know this, I was lead to believe only the Knights of
  Truth knew of Castle Mistmoore. Nyxx!&quot; He placed a hand on her shoulder
  as he leaned across the table. Nyxx held the large scroll close to her and did
  not look up.<br>
  &quot;The bards and other organizations including the Knights of Truth are
  aware of the castle’s existence and have been for some time.&quot; Tyrus was
  stunned, he did not move he just waited. Everyone in the room could sense
  there was more, perhaps more than they wanted to hear. Reradan moved closer to
  Ingram with some renewed interest in the dusty old books.<br>
  &quot;The Bards, the Steel Warriors, Knights of Truth and a few more
  organizations have been gathering information and working to battle the evil
  in that castle for a very, very long time.&quot; Nyxx pulled a letter from the
  satchel and dropped it on the table. She pointed to it.<br>
  &quot;That is the a rough map supplied by a ranger station in Lesser
  Faydark.&quot; She paused as Ingram opened the letter and unfolded the map and
  placed it before the others. Padmai and Sam had moved closer to the table to
  get a better look.<br>
  &quot;The rangers believe they can guide us to the castle.&quot; Nyxx had
  tears running down her face now, she was clutching the large scroll and
  twisting it in her hands.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;The bards have sent a number of agents into the area but only one
  escaped and he died later.&quot; Mightyd and Ivanan took up position around
  the table and Mightyd had rested a hand on Nyxx’s shoulder to comfort her.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;The bard who escaped was able to tell us what happened to the other bard
  who was captured.&quot; The room was dead silent and the morning light that
  began to fill the room did nothing to clear the darkness that hung in the air.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;She was turned, infected with the curse of the wolf, made into a
  werewolf. There is only one way to free her.&quot; Nyxx laid the large scroll
  down on the table and tried to unroll it but her hands would not cooperate.
  Kel gently moved her hands aside and carefully unrolled the scroll. On the
  scroll was the face of a beautiful woman dressed in a beautiful gossamer gown.
  She was a striking woman. The hair on Samadhi’s neck stood straight up and
  he closed his eyes. Padmai took a sharp breath and her hand moved to cover her
  mouth. Tyrus looked at the woman and tried to think of something to say but
  could not find the words.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Oh God Nyxx, who is she?&quot; Mightyd’s words were no longer full of
  fun, rather his voice was strained and serious. The other members of the Oasis
  glanced at each other hoping against hope there were wrong. Nyxx paused and
  choked back her words, she took a deep breath and continued.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;She is my mother.&quot;<br>

  <p>Soulfire chapter 5</p>
  </b><font size="2">
  <p>Derfrain rubbed his hands together for warmth and blinked the morning dew
  out of his eyes. He sat in silence as morning found its way into the dark
  corners of Lesser Faydark, as he had a hundred times before and would a
  thousand more. His fingers moved small blades of grass aside to reveal
  imprints in the ground. To most the indentations would suggest that travelers
  had passed this way a long time ago, but to the ranger it was the sign of
  horses under the spell of the wind. The feet of these horses did not press
  firm into the ground but rode upon the air blessed by the power of Tunare, the
  spell had been a prayer spoken by a fellow ranger and a comrade. His comrade
  was guiding important people through the dark woods and it was of the utmost
  importance that the dark ones did not find them or interrupt their mission. It
  was the way of the rangers in such times to send a party into the forest in
  this way, the guide did not know his charges destination only that he was to
  make for the ranger station without actually heading for it. Another ranger
  would be dispatched with orders to track a fellow ranger within Lesser
  Faydark. In this way the parties would meet at a totally unannounced and
  unplanned spot and Derfrain would take the party the rest of the way to their
  destination.</p>
  <p>Derfrain had the trail now and it would be this day that he found them. He
  raised his face into the light mist that fell from the trees above, and spoke
  a prayer to his beloved lady and goddess Tunare. His lungs filled with the
  fresh scent of nature and for a moment his heart skipped a beat, his ranger
  heart felt the taint that scarred the forest and it pained as it shared the
  wound. The prayer he started was taken up again as he lowered his head,
  Derfrain’s eyes turned red and his face began to change. The soft grass gave
  way as the ranger’s body crashed into it. He dug his fingers hard into the
  soil and swore aloud that he would not rest until the forest was once again
  pure. The prayer came to an end and his lungs once again filled with air, he
  threw his head back in pure defiance and shouted both his pain and lands pain
  into the air, it came out as a long mournful howl. The great wolf turned and
  darted off following the scent of magic and horses. The young fairy had been
  watching from a distance, the rangers’ prayer had drawn her attention and
  she moved close to see the soul that belonged to the speaker. She smiled as
  the great wolf moved away but for a moment she wondered in only a fleeting
  thought if it was morning dew or a tear that she had seen in the sharp eyes of
  the wolf.</p>
  <p>It was the 5<sup>th</sup> day they had been riding through the dark forest
  and it seemed a fitting place for the travelers, none of them had the stomach
  for talking and the normal playful conversations that they shared were not to
  be heard. Each of them new they were headed for what would most likely be the
  fight of their lives and yet it was not fear that kept them silent but rather
  sorrow. Ahead of them lay a castle filled with death and evil and the mother
  of one of there own a mother who they were going to kill. Tyrus had worn a
  frown since the day they entered the forest. He had tried to talk to Nyxx and
  tell her she could count on him, but for what? Tyrus had tried to offer hope
  some kind words but he faltered and in the end all he could say, all that he
  could offer was a promise to end her mothers suffering as fast and painlessly
  as possible. Kelemvor stayed at his loves side these five days but without
  speaking, only listening and offering a shoulder for comfort when she wanted
  it.</p>
  <p>They had been together for over 2 years now and had faced death more times
  than they could recall. They had come to know each other in a way they each
  had not thought possible. Death had faced them and tried to break them but it
  had always failed. The covenant was pact in blood forged in battle and
  tempered with trust and honor, never the less this task was a drain on them.
  Many of the people they would be facing were sons and daughters of Tunare
  trapped in a vile nightmare of evil. Their souls locked in bodies now
  controlled by demon spirits, forced to watch as the demons used their bodies
  to foul the land that they loved more than life. The torture of these souls
  could only be imagined, and it made them sick to think on it for long. Tyrus
  rode beside Reradan and they tried to make conversation about the upcoming
  battle but neither had the heart for it, maybe it was partly the darkness that
  they had rode in for the last few days.</p>
  <p>There ranger guide gestured and the company came to a halt. The ranger
  turned in his saddle and sniffed at the air then dismounted. The company
  followed his lead and each pulled his mount to ground, the ranger trained
  horses complied and seconds later the whole company was well hidden in the
  grass. Tyrus kept looking at Kelemvor for some sign, he knew Kel was an
  accomplished tracker and a master of the woods in his own right. Moments
  passed and Tyrus found his hand had moved to his blade and was even now
  withdrawing it from the scabbard, it seemed to Tyrus that it was not his will
  that directed his hand but something else.</p>
  <p>The ranger relaxed and stood followed by Kelemvor. Out of the trees ahead
  walked a very large wolf its coat was that of white and silver a noble beast
  indeed. The company stood almost as one as the ranger started toward the wolf
  and began speaking. Reradan had already urged his mount back to its feet and
  was checking the packs and supplies.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hail brother!&quot; the ranger now stood before the wolf and Samadhi
  noted the size as the wolfs snout was at mid chest height to the ranger. The
  ranger smiled as he scratched the great wolf behind the ear, the wolf snarled
  and stepped back.</p>
  <p>&quot;My brother you’re getting touchy in your old age.&quot; The ranger
  motioned the wolf towards the company and they both began walking to the camp
  that was being set by Mightyd and Ivanan. The great wolf lowered its head and
  then let out a howl, as its howl ended there was no longer a wolf before them
  but a forest clad ranger. Tyrus never tired of seeing such power in the hands
  of good, it made his heart jump to know that such power was working the same
  path as he was. Samadhi moved away from the ranger and feigned assistance in
  breaking out the supplies with Mightyd and Ivanan. Ingram and Padmai seemed
  oblivious to the goings on and appeared wrapped in a conversation of their
  own, Ingram pulled at his chin considering each of Padmai’s words. Tyrus
  began to think that he was the only civilized person amongst his friends, he
  marched forward and stuck his hand out toward the ranger who had moments
  before been a great wolf.</p>
  <p>&quot;Greetings, hail and well met. I am Tyrus Storm&quot; Mightyd looked
  up just long enough to blink and shake his head at the paladins ear to ear
  smile. ‘One day he will change, one day’ he thought. Padmai took notice
  and bit her lower lip knowing the rangers obviously better than her paladin
  companion. The new ranger looked at the outstretched hand and then slowly into
  the eyes of the youngling human who stood before him. His eyes narrowed and he
  leaned toward the human ignoring the hand that was still open before him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Human you have the smell of death about you.&quot; He side stepped
  around Tyrus and moved to stand beside his fellow ranger and began speaking
  with him in hushed tones. Tyrus lowered his hand, his ears were visibly red
  and his face only now began to relax his boyishly innocent smile. Nyxx let her
  hand pass gently pass over his shoulder as she carried a pack closer to the
  center of the camp.</p>
  <p>&quot;Its not you Tyrus, it’s the ranger way.&quot; She said softly. She
  dropped her pack and turned back toward Tyrus as Kelemvor began unpacking the
  pack she had dropped before him. Tyrus had not moved and was grateful to his
  comrades for not staring at him, ‘Damn I hate feeling like a child, I
  don’t care what faces us I can’t loose hope I refuse to.’ He thought to
  himself and wondered why the ranger had responded so. Absent-mindedly he
  looked at his armored hand as if to see, to see what? ‘Bah, I have no time
  for this’ he decided to let it go. Nyxx was now beside him looking into his
  eyes with that look, a man could fall forever in those eyes. Tyrus smiled a
  small smile, as part of him became very aware of why the druid Kelemvor would
  leave his forests to be beside this woman.</p>
  <p>&quot;Tyrus?&quot; Nyxx rested her hand on his arm and drew him back to
  reality. Kelemvor looked up and grinned, he knew that look on the paladin’s
  face he had felt it on his own face a thousand times before.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sorry Nyxx you were saying.&quot; Tyrus shot Kel a look and Kel
  grinned back at him, a silent sentence passed between them as the druid let
  Tyrus know that he did not blame him for looking at his one true love as he
  did.</p>
  <p>&quot;I was saying that rangers don’t take to people well, it takes a
  long time for them to warm upto folks, so don’t take it personally.&quot;
  She gave him an almost motherly pat on the face and glided back to Kels side
  and once again busied herself with setting up camp. Tyrus turned toward the
  two rangers to find only their guide standing beside the great wolf once
  again. The wolf padded towards Tyrus and spoke in a low growling tone.</p>
  <p>&quot;She is right youngling it’s not personal, but know this. I have
  walked the way of the bow and blade for over one hundred of your years and I
  would not walk the path you wish me to take you upon.&quot; The wolf began to
  move off towards the edge of the camp it paused as if thinking then turned its
  head back once again toward Tyrus.</p>
  <p>&quot;You are covered in the stench of death human, I know not if it is
  from your past or the future but its there.&quot; And he was gone, into the
  darkness and cover of the trees. Their ranger guide sighed and shook his head.</p>
  <p>&quot;I am stationed out of Kelethin and more familiar with outsiders, I
  apologize for my brother.&quot; He was now gathering his belongings and
  shouldering a small pack.</p>
  <p>&quot;I leave you with my horse as a burden bearer, I will have no need of
  her on my journey back but please return her to the stables when you
  can.&quot; He patted the mare on the neck and whispered words into her ear,
  she snorted and looked toward the company.</p>
  <p>&quot;If you find you have no need of the horses or can go no further with
  them, release them and she will bring them home.&quot; He moved toward Tyrus
  and put out his hand and smiled. Tyrus took the rangers hand gladly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well Tunare keep you safe, I will take my leave of you.&quot; He
  started for the darkness of the trees but Tyrus shouted after him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wait! We have traveled with your for 5 days and I have do not know
  your name.&quot; Reradan sucked in a breath and took a few steps toward Tyrus
  then halted ‘no I cant live his life for him he has to learn on his own’
  he thought. Reradan was sure the ranger had caught his few steps as their eyes
  met for just a split second. Tyrus heard the sound from Reradan and turned his
  head but Reradan had already assumed a casual stance again. Tyrus whipped his
  head back towards the ranger and found that a scowl was creeping across his
  normally calm paladin face.</p>
  <p>&quot;Marr keep my fool tongue silent. What did I do now&quot; he shot
  looks around the camp. The ranger smiled and paused to pull air into his
  lungs.</p>
  <p>&quot;You did nothing wrong knight. I offer my name in a sign of friendship
  and hopes that you can all greet me again in a more pleasant time. Maybe we
  can raise a glass of Tunares’ finest and speak off great forests and perfect
  winds.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mightyd chuckled and stood tall. &quot;Aye ranger a good meeting that will
  be but best if you speak of forests and I will just listen and drink of
  Tunare’s finest&quot; Mightyd shot a smile at the ranger.</p>
  <p>&quot;Very well, but beware I have a bards ability to spin a tale when
  forests are involved.&quot; The ranger drew himself up and saluted them with
  his bow in hand. He closed his eyes and with his free hand motioned in a
  sweeping gesture to the forest around him.</p>
  <p>&quot;What once was shall be again. As the wolf hunts, we hunt the
  darkness.&quot; His voice was echoed by a rough voice as the great wolf walked
  out of the tree line towards them.</p>
  <p>&quot;As the wind howls, we rage against the night.&quot; The wolfs form
  softened and once again the green clad ranger was standing beside his brother.</p>
  <p>&quot;As the tree bends forever so does my bow bend against the
  enemy.&quot; Tyus felt the hair on his neck stand and felt the rush of pride
  flow through him.</p>
  <p>&quot;As the mountains stand forever so shall we, we are the rangers and we
  stand now and forever until what once was pure is again pure.&quot; Tyrus felt
  it in his soul and knew that these soldiers were not just woodsmen they were
  brothers. Knights as much as he was. These were knights of nature.</p>
  <p>&quot;My name is Goshin, ranger and humble servant to my lady and goddess
  Tunare. May her gentle hand keep and guide you.&quot; And he was gone.</p>
