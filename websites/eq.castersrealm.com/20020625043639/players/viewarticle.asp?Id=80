<p>Ravell awoke with a start.  His entire body throbbed with pain, and he found breathing difficult.  After his head cleared, he studied the area surrounding him.  Faerie fires shaped into various mystical symbols burned all around.  Stone walls surrounded Ravell, without any visible means of entrance.  Ravell tried to sit up, but found that he was shackled down to a wooden table by his wrists and ankles. Around his neck was a thick leather collar, and though it didn't hold him down it only added to his discomfort.  He tried weakly to get free, but gave up and laid back down.  His head felt fuzzy, like he had just tipped back a few ales. Resigning himself to whatever fate he had fallen into, Ravell tried to relax.</p>
<p>	"How did I survive?"Ravell thought aloud.</p>
<p>	"Think less about what happened in the past and more about your current situation, warrior." A delicate voice filled the seemingly empty room.</p>
<p>	Ravell squirmed around in his shackles, trying to make out who the owner of the voice was and where she was at.  "Who are you?!"</p>
<p>	A chuckle sounded from right in front of Ravell, but he still couldn't see anyone.  Suddenly a female drow appeared, surrounded by black flowing robes. "My name is Nyvare.  I am your owner now, so you will refer to me as Miss Nyvare, understand?"</p>
<p>	"Nobody owns me." Ravell again tried to break free of his shackles.</p>
<p>	"Correction, warrior. Nobody used to own you. You were a promising fighter and a decent leader, but you failed.  Lord N'Vitar wanted you killed, but I convinced him to let me have you instead.  I bought your life, Ravell, but I can take it just as easily.  You can serve me just as well as a skeleton." Nyvare smirked.</p>
<p>	Ravell sat back again, giving up his attempt to break free. "So you are a necromancer.  Tell me, what happened to the others? Did they live also?"</p>
<p>	"Indeed young one, but it was close.  There was a shadowknight with you, Lilith I believe her name was?  You of course know she came from a wealthy and influential family.  They had her followed, to ensure her success on her first real mission." Nyvare began to inspect one of the floating symbols.</p>
<p>	"So is she now a slave too? I can't imagine her family would like that much." Ravell asked.</p>
<p>	"Hah! You are the only one enslaved. You were the leader after all.  You held the responsibility for the group, and it was nearly wiped out.  No, warrior, Lilith is just fine.  She is just starting a new mission.  You should worry less about the others, and more about yourself.  I still haven't decided to let you live." Nyvare's delicate voice added an eerie feel to her threat.</p>
<p>	"I don't care if you kill me.  I am a disgrace to the Indigo Brotherhood.  My life is worthless." Ravell sighed.</p>
<p>	Nyvare tilted her head, looking very much like a bird inspecting its food.  "Worthless to you, perhaps.  I think I have found a use for you."</p>
<p>	"I will not be an errand boy," Ravell snarled. "Running around Neriak getting supplies for your magics... I would rather be dead."</p>
<p>	"Oh I did not plan to have you serve as such.  It would be a waste of your skills as a warrior.  Besides, you have been banished from Neriak.  If N'Vitar or his guards so much as glimpse you, you will be no more than a stain on the Neriak streets." Nyvare seemed to take pleasure in describing the last part.</p>
<p>	"Well,  what then?" Ravell looked up.</p>
<p>	"You will travel to Befallen.  There is a shadowknight there who has crossed me, and I want him dead."Nyvare's face contorted to show more anger than Ravell thought was possible.</p>
<p>	"Befallen? I have heard that place is filled with undead.  Perhaps I should have some company?" Ravell asked hopefully.</p>
<p>	"Not likely, warrior.  Do not worry about the undead, you should be able to handle them.  If not, then I have suffered only the loss of a banished warrior.  Make sure that you kill the right shadowknight.  He is an ogre, and he will likely be deep within the ruins."Nyvare instructed.</p>
<p>	"And what if I leave Neriak behind for good, and travel out of your reach?  I am not fond of ruins." Ravell smirked.</p>
<p>	"You cannot travel out of my reach, warrior.  I have fastened a collar around your neck that will let me control you if necessary.  It cannot be removed.  If you do not do my simple task, then I shall perhaps make you more of a disgrace by forcing you to attack Neriak." Nyvare chuckled again.</p>
<p>	Ravell tried to grasp at his neck, but was still shackled down. "Very well, Nyvare.  I shall attempt your task, but the moment I have a chance to escape you... I will be gone."</p>
<p>	Nyvare looked at Ravell coldly. "And I shall not give you that chance, warrior.  You are mine for life, and failing that, death.  And you will refer to me as Miss Nyvare."</p>

<p>	Garit sat meditating in his elegant room quietly.  He had only just returned home the day before, and had been out at the pubs with old friends and family.  Garit was an honorable paladin of Tunare and was very strict in his rules.  Despite all of his adventures out on the mainland, he still refused to drink.  He went to pubs simply to socialize and keep bar fights to a minimum.  Usually, though, he was practicing his swordplay and keeping his mind just as sharp as the razor edge of his two-handed sword.  </p>
<p>	Garit stood up and grabbed his sword, pulling the sheath off.  It shined brilliantly in the spacious room, and he took a moment to admire its beauty.  "Strange how such a tool meant for killing can be so beautiful.  I would be better off in a world without need of arms..." He thought aloud.  A knock sounded on one of his thick oak doors, interrupting Garit's concentration.  He frowned slightly and sheathed the sword before opening his doors.</p>
<p>	"Garit, sir.  The family requires your presence in the living quarters.  A ranger has arrived with news of your brother." A servant stated.</p>
<p>	"Very well, tell them I am on my way." Garit replied.  The servant bowed and walked away as Garit shut the doors.  "Brother, it will be good to see you again." He whispered to the vacant room.</p>
<p>-----</p>

<p>	The wood elven ranger stood nervously in the center of the giant room.  A fireplace blazed quietly off to the side, and a collection of high elves were about the room.  The ranger felt slightly out of place, but had to deliver his news and the child to these people.  Relaxing a bit, the ranger tried to observe closer the family of high elves around him.  The father seemed to be a wizard, or perhaps a mage.  He sat in a large armchair staring at the fire.  His face was unreadable, he could have been very worried or very angry.  This unsettled the wood elf some.  Turning his attention to the mother of the house, the ranger could very easily read her.  She paced back and forth on a rug, muttering to herself and wearing her worry so plainly the ranger began to feel even more uneasy about the news he had to bring.  Finally, the ranger looked at a young elf sitting curled up in an armchair off to the side of the fire.  She was remarkably beautiful, even for an elf.  She was biting at her nails, plainly worried but also trying to keep her emotions hidden.  Simply looking at her made the ranger relax.</p>
<p>	Then the brother came down the twisting stairway.  He was obviously a paladin, and an experienced one at that.  His shining armor and regal walk made him seem every bit like noble paladins the wood elf had heard about in stories.  He came straight up to the ranger and shook his hand heartily.</p>
<p>	"Well then," Garit began. "What of my brother?  I had expected him to be here before I arrived, yet he is still not here."</p>
<p>	The ranger detected a hopefulness in the paladin's tone, and gulped loudly before beginning.  "Sir, I am not quite sure how to tell you this so I'll just say it.  Your brother is dead."</p>
<p>	Garit looked about to fall, but stood firm.  The young high elf curled in the chair fell apart, crying loudly.  With surprising speed the old elf caster jumped from his chair to catch the fainting mother.  Setting her down in his chair, he simply nodded to the ranger and began to study a spellbook intensely.  The ranger noticed a tear creep from the old one's eye before the paladin before him collected himself enough to speak.</p>
<p>	"How?" Was all he said.</p>
<p>	The ranger's nervousness temporarily dissapeared and he spoke clearly.  "He fought a noble fight.  He fell in the forest of Kithicor, while battling the undead menace within."</p>
<p>	Garit looked unconvinced.  "My brother was a valiant paladin of Tunare, and plenty skilled with a blade.  There must have been a huge amount of undead fighting him."</p>
<p>	The ranger grimaced slightly, then pulled the paladin in close to whisper.  "Truth is, sir, we don't know what killed him.  Undead killed the cleric with him, but he was felled by an unknown force.  Kithicor is a mysterious and very dangerous place.  I'm sure you've heard all the stories."</p>
<p>	Garit stepped back.  "I see." He took a moment to think quietly to himself and then went to comfort his sister in the armchair.  The wood elf stood there awkwardly and waited.  Before long the old wizard came up to him.</p>
<p>	"You said there was a cleric with him?" He sounded as if he had not heard that his son just died. "Who was it?"</p>
<p>	The wood elf shuffled uneasily.  He pulled his backpack off and laid it gently on the floor.  "Well, sir, that brings me to the next piece of news.  She was a human cleric of Rodcet Nife.  Your son married her many seasons ago in the temple of Rodcet Nife in Qeynos and..."</p>
<p>	He was cut off by the old caster. "You must be mistaken.  My son would not marry a...a human!  I raised him to be a principled youth, not some rogue!"</p>
<p>	"Sir, I can understand why you wouldn't believe me but I do have to insist that your son did indeed wed a human." The ranger replied.</p>
<p>	"You...you can't know.  You didn't know him like we did.  He was our family!" The old elf argued.</p>
<p>	The ranger undid his backpack and brought out a bundle of cloth covering a baby.  A half-elf child.  The old father still didn't look convinced when the ranger shuffled some of the cloth around and brought out the family crested necklace.</p>
<p>	The old caster's eyes bulged and he now wore a very angry look on his face.  It was the most emotion the ranger had seen in the old one and he began to question bringing the child out.</p>
<p>	"Get out!" The flustered old high elf managed.  Only too happy to oblige, the ranger practically tripped over his own feet to get out of the stuffy house.</p>
<p>------</p>

<p>	"How could he do this to us?!" The old caster stormed.  "How could he bring such disgrace to our family?  We will be laughed at by the townspeople, you know.  A...a... human!!"</p>
<p>	Garit stood up and glared at his father.  "My brother, your son...we were the best of friends.  I grew up with him, we attended our practice together.  We trained together, we adventured together.  He was an honorable paladin, a first-rate citizen, and most of all an excellent person.  You! You raised him, you brought him up and taught him right from wrong.  And suddenly you forget all...all of that because he married a human?!  Father, you didn't even know the lady.  But you condemn both him and her because of her race?"</p>
<p>	Garit's father looked incredulous as his own son verbally attacked him.  "Humans are beneath us, son!  You must always remember, humans are contemptious beings!  They lie, they cheat, they squabble amongst themselves, they shed the blood of their closest friends.  Your brother forgot this, and was corrupted by them.  He has brought great shame to this house, and you!  The brother you once knew died the day he married a human!"	</p>
<p>	Garit looked more and more disgusted with every sentence from the old caster's mouth.  "If that is what you believe, father, then I cannot claim to be a part of this 'house' any longer.  You are old and stubborn, and you will bring the only disgrace to our family by treating as an elitist club that we must meet requirements to be members in."</p>
<p>	With that said he marched straight to his room, grabbed his traveling bag and sword, and marched back downstairs.  His sister stopped him at the bottom of the stairwell.</p>
<p>	"Brother," She said, looking up through tear-filled eyes. "I am going with you."</p>
<p>	Garit looked down into his sister's face.  "Aye, sister.  Perhaps it is time to show you more of the world.  It will do you good to get away from his influence.  I shall meet you at the pub in an hour.  Pack your things and be there.  We shall head out immediately afterwards."</p>
<p>	A smile glanced upon the young elf's face and she ran up to her room.  Garit marched out into the living quarters, where his father stood holding the child and his mother was sobbing softly in her armchair.</p>
<p>	Garit walked first to his mother, saying simply. "Mother, I must leave now.  I shall write you, but you must understand me not visiting.  His mother gripped his wrist firmly and nodded before returning to her grief.</p>
<p>	"You will take this if you are leaving.  Carry it and learn of the shame I tried to teach you of.  When you have learned your lesson, return to me and beg my forgiveness."  The old wizard instructed sternly, holding out the half-elf baby.</p>
<p>	Garit gripped the child gently in his arms.  "I shall take this child, but not for your lessons.  It deserves a better home than you would give it, and I shall make sure that my brother's legacy lives on.  I shall never beg for your forgiveness!"</p>
<p>	With that said, Garit adjusted his sword and walked out into the streets of Felwithe carrying the half-elven child.</p>
