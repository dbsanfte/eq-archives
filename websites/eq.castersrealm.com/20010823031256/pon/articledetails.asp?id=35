</tr>
<tr> 
<td width='80%'><P>There are many arguments as to how a paladin should be played based on the 
type of player you are. I for one am a role player so many power gamers might 
never see my points. The Paladin is a holy fighter who can be played in 
different ways but all circle around the same basic idea. A Paladin serves his 
God and his religion first. The Paladin is a just and mighty warrior able to 
detect evil and deal with it in short order. The Paladin shelters the weak and 
defends the oppressed, they are the shining light in a world of strife.</P>
<P>A Paladin is granted his gifts through the priests of his deity and is 
expected to follow the beliefs of his religion. In Everquest any Joe off the 
street can choose to play a Paladin and because of this the class can be 
diluted. Normally it is very hard to become a Paladin and even harder to live 
the life of one. Paladins are not the strongest fighters or the best healers. 
The idea is that they are a capable fighter who can tend to themselves when all 
is said and done. They are their deity's champions, enforcing their will 
throughout the land.</P>
<P>I enjoy my Paladin because it is the character I have role played for years. 
They heal the wounded, cure the ills of the sick, bring hope to the beaten, and 
hunt down evil wherever it may roam. In my travels across the lands I heal those 
that need it without being asked to do so. I hear someone is poisoned or 
diseased and cure them of their ailments. I see a poor soul who caught the back 
end of a nasty train and use my LoH that they might escape. I have stepped in 
front of a mob dishing out too much damage for someone to take so that I may 
free them to kill the creature unharmed any further.</P>
<P>Other Paladins may not do these things but it does not make them any less a 
Paladin, just a different one. Maybe a servant of Mithaniel Marr chooses to only 
do these things for humans. Due to the extreme ability the player has to role 
play a Paladin in Everquest it would have been nice if there was a deeper detail 
to what the particular gods would expect of their followers in this role. I am a 
follower of Brell but I am still attuned to the Followers of Tunare, and the 
Followers of Marr. I am not better than they and they are not better than me, 
for no matter what differences we may have we are all after the same major goal, 
to thwart evil.</P>
<P>I believe the class as a whole could have been handled better in a few ways 
than it was and that is another reason for this write up. By allowing anyone but 
a human to become a paladin Verant went against the grain, though this is an 
aspect I rather like. On the other hand, they also allowed a paladin to be an 
agnostic and that is something I just can't agree with. A Paladin is a holy 
warrior and to be such you must follow a God. If no God is worshipped than 
exactly who is bestowing the gifts upon this warrior?</P>
<P>A Paladin is a devout warrior of his god. Depending on the lore you know you 
have heard of a Paladin smiting a vile creature single handedly, or maybe you 
heard of a group of five paladins doing what a regular army couldn't. The way I 
like to look at this is simple enough. A solo, 45 level Paladin slays a creature 
of 35 that is terrorizing a certain area and the people of the area cheer him. A 
group of five level 45 paladins slay a monster that was otherwise eating groups 
alive because they lacked healing, or spells fizzled, or no buffs were 
available.</P>
<P>Paladins alone can do little but teamed together they can indeed be a nasty 
force to reckon with. A Paladin can shine in just about any group, they can take 
damage for their team, they can heal members who were injured. Yes, they can 
practically bring a person from near death to full health with a touch of their 
hands once a day. My healing right now is not that strong, but to a spellcaster 
it is more than enough. My damage potential is not the highest in the group, but 
with my other abilities in reserve, it is enough.</P>
<P>As a reward for my sacrifices, yes I die quite a bit for my groups and even 
for perfect strangers, I am blessed with holy weapons and armor. Well, this may 
be where things tend to hit a decline. If Everquest was a real life situation no 
one would be complaining of class balance because it would all come down to how 
much work you put into your ability. Paladins are known to be workaholics always 
in search of a quest, especially if the quest is for a holy item they know their 
god would not want to fall into the wrong hands. They practice humility and do 
as their God bids without question. For this they are rewarded with some of the 
finest equipment to aid them in their god's work.</P>
<P>Everyone has heard the complaints about the holy swords being weak for some 
time. Everyone has heard the sudden uproar over the Armour of Ro quests. Few 
understand why Paladins are truly crying foul. The work is expected, Paladins 
learn that they are given nothing easily, but what they have worked so hard for 
is something that will define them further as a Holy Knight. According to belief 
there should be no weapon made by man more powerful than one made by a God for a 
Paladin. On the same note the weapons made by the Gods for their avatars (I 
choose to believe that cazic thule in PoF is just an embodiment of the God 
himself etc.) should be stronger than those of the Paladin. The same would hold 
true for the armor.</P>
<P>This by no means defines any one aspect of the ability of a holy sword. For 
example, a warrior may wield a weapon that in fact does more raw melee damage, 
but a Holy Sword will have some blessing that makes it the weapon of choice to a 
Paladin. Ghoulbane was a good example of this as it has an effect that hurts 
undead. There is a shortage of holy weapons as it is, there should at least be 
one per Paladin God. There should be real effects associated with the swords and 
they should not be limited. (i.e. Soulfire with 5 charges of healing) If you use 
up all the charges of the Soulfire it is, in essence, no longer a holy sword, 
the gift bestowed is now used up and it is now a normal weapon, man makes 
weapons like that, not Gods.</P>
<P>Paladins are usually the member of a group most eager to take the beating, it 
is what their God wishes. To aid them in doing this their God bestows upon them 
the ability to take that beating a little better than most. Verant did a good 
job with the spells for a Paladin, but the Armour of Ro is lacking at best, you 
don't just run to the store and buy this armor. Verant also made taunt a very 
weak skill. To prove this point you can usually find a Paladin in a group 
casting Flash of Light to further try and upset a mob. Later in life a Paladin 
can use greater heal to effectively keep that mob on him. Paladins were not 
meant to dual wield or use skills like kick, they use taunt, they use bash and 
normally they are very good at these two skills. Verant seems to think 
otherwise, not exactly sure why.</P>
<P>All in all, the Paladin as a class is not all that bad, the fixes that would 
be needed for them would appear relatively easy to implement. The people who 
play Paladins and ask for certain skills to be improved are asking for the good 
of people they fight with. What good does taunt do for the solo Paladin? The 
request for more 1HS holy swords is valid, what good is bash if you can never 
hold a shield to do so with? Quests for these items need to be better thought 
out and implemented, a Paladin would never be asked to kill another Paladin for 
his weapon. In most ideals of the Paladin order this would be grounds for losing 
one's Paladin status. Permanently remaining KOS in Freeport for killing the 
leader of the corrupt Militia is nonsense. The flag should dissipate over time 
as in a RL scenario the corrupt Militia would in fact be disbanded.</P>
<P>I am having fun playing my Paladin, and yes I could have a lot more. There is 
much to be done in this world and there are things to be left alone. If no one 
brings up the things that need change than change will never happen and what a 
boring world this would be. I for one think many of the things that are not 
correct in the world now come from poor planning, but that is for another write 
up.</P>
