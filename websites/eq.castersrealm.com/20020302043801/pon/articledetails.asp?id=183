Divine Might
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Chapter 1 :</b> Wandering through the Beholder Maze, you see a tough
little Dwarf, swinging heavily at a small outcropping of rock.&nbsp; He looks
tired, but greets you with a smile and tells you his name is Diggs Duggun.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You hail him and he responds heartily:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>&quot;ail, dere! Ain'tcha a sight fer me sore eyes! I knows dat we're
  strangers an' all, but might I ask a [boon] of ye?&quot;&nbsp; You look to him
  quizzically and ask him about the &quot;boon&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; He hefts an
  enormous pick axe onto his shoulder, peering at its chipped and scarred tip.&nbsp;
  &quot;Well, me pickaxe is blunted awfully bad and me ale supplies are
  dangerously low. If'n ye would be kind enough t' get me a new pick and a
  couple o' bottles o' dwarven ale, I would be f'rever in yer debt.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know the only place to find Dwarven Ale is in Kaladim, as is the type of
pick axe he requires, and as you were heading over to make peace with the
Gnomish King, you decide Kaladim is not too far out of your way.&nbsp; Diggs
happily accepts your assistance, and with a whispered curse to his pick axe,
continues hacking away at the unyielding rock.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2 :</b> You travel through Norrath, finding a friendly Elven Druid
to use his earthen magics to transport you to a Druidic Ring outside of Ak'Anon.&nbsp;
After a brief visit to the Gnomish King, you give up on explaining that
Clockworks are easily expendible and head out to Kaladim.&nbsp; Just outside of
the bank in the Great Dwarven City, you find a vendor that stocks pick axes
similar to Diggs'.&nbsp; You purchase the pick axe and stop by the tavern on the
way out to purchase two bottles of Dwarven Ale.&nbsp; Thanking the dwarves for
their hospitality, you head to the docks and wait for the ship to sail you back
towards the Beholder Maze.&nbsp;
<p><b>Chapter 3 :</b> Travelling through Freeport, the Commons and deadly
Kithicor Forest, you arrive at Misty Thicket for a night's rest.&nbsp; You set
out in the morning, walking quietly through the Misty Thicket, slaying Goblins
who are constantly assaulting the Wall.&nbsp; Slippping through Runnyeye, you
arrive back in the Beholder Maze and search for Diggs.&nbsp; You find him
cleaning off his pick axe, blood crusted on his head and two Great Minotaurs
lying in a heap.&nbsp; You heal him with the magic of Marr and he looks at you
expectantly.&nbsp; You hand him the pick axe and his 2 Dwarven Ales(not
stacked).&nbsp; Diggs drinks an ale heartily and burps loudly:
<blockquote>
  <p><i>&quot;By Brell's Beard! Yer a lifesaver, ya are! 'ere, take dis bone
  I've found 'ere in dis maze. Looks human ta me and I'm thinkin that a proper
  burial is in order. Freeport's the closest place dat has one o' Marr's
  temples. I'm thinkin dis was one o' his Holy Knights by da look o' da tattered
  tunic I found it wrapped in. I'm thinkin Valeron might be havin an interest in
  it.&quot;</i> &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that he hands you a dusty old leg bone and you head out thanking him for
his gift.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4 :</b> Returning to Freeport, you head through the familiar Hall
of Truth and find Valeron looking out upon shackled Militia in the courtyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They are burnishing plate armour for the Knights of Truth, paying justice for
the evil their ilk has brought.&nbsp; Valeron looks upon you warmly and you
explain to that you met Diggs Duggun in the Beholder Maze.&nbsp; Valeron gazes
upon the dusty leg bone and finds some cloth under the knee.&nbsp;
&quot;According to this crest on the tunic, you have recovered one of the bones
of a lost Paladin [Hero].&quot;&nbsp; Interested, you ask what Hero would that
be?&nbsp; Valeron looks upon you with pride and says, &quot;His name has been
long lost but his legend lives on in every young knight who aspires to continue
his fight. He attempted to quell an evil that resided within Kithicor,
perverting nature itself. Much to his relief, it was an earthly foe he fought
against and not a denizen summoned from the planes of evil. Then, suddenly, he
was surrounded by dozens of dark elves. He was captured and taken to the Dead to
be experimented upon and had his soul twisted by vile necromantic magics. Then
the Tier'Dal cast his remains to the winds. Where they landed, no one knew,
until now. You have found one of his bones. I hereby charge you with a Holy
Quest to bring this Hero's bones back for a burial with honors. Do you [accept],
knight?&quot;&nbsp; You know there is no better reason in life than to serve the
memory of a Hero and graciously accept.&nbsp; Valeron Dushire says &quot;Good! I
knew you would. It is one of the highest honors one can receive. Your quest will
not be easy for I know not where his other bones lay. A spy of ours within
Neriak was able to surmise that six of his bones along with his sword and shield
were scattered throughout Norrath. You must search far and wide to find the
remaining pieces, as you already have one.. Do not give up. It is now your
sacred duty. Once you have retrieved all eight pieces, come back to me and
inform me that you [have all the bones].&quot;
<p><b>Chapter 5 :</b> You head out from the Hall of Truth, Courage and Bravery
leading the way!&nbsp; You begin to hear rumours of these bones and after a
month's worth of travel across all of Norrath, you are able to surmise the
location of many of the parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you retrieve the last part, you
look into your backpack and recount the items you have found:
<ul>
  <li>A dusty leg, the first piece you received from your friend Diggs Duggun.
  <li>A dusty skull, found in the Mino Caves in Meldrith's room.
  <li>A dusty ribcage, found half buried in the Garden at Mistmoore Castle.
  <li>A dusty backbone, found in a Pit of Ghosts within Unrest.
  <li>A dusty Jawbone, found deep within an Ice Cave in Everfrost.
  <li>A dusty fingerbone, found within Phinigel's room on a ledge in murky Kedge
    Keep.
  <li>A dusty broken Sword, found in the very Mines of Kaladim, just under the
    water.
  <li>A dusty Shield, found on the Eastern Cliffs in Erudin.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know this part of your journey has come to an end and return to the Hall
ofTruth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Chapter 6 :</b> Valeron is happy to see you and is impressed by the
journey's you have undergone in the search for the Hero's bones.&nbsp; You tell
him you have all of the bones and he says, &quot;Excellent! You are indeed
worthy to bear the title of Holy Knight! Now, about the coffin.. I have spoken
with Ping Fizzlecutter, outside the western gates. Ask him about the coffin and
once it is made, bring it to Simon Aldicott of Marr. I shall have Simon meet you
by the lake in the Commonlands after Ping gives you the coffin.&quot;&nbsp; You
thank Valeron and head over to meet Ping at the Western Gates.
<p align="left"><b>Chapter 7 :</b> Ping has heard of your great journey across
Norrath and offers to make you the coffin for free if you can bring him the
proper ingredients.&nbsp; You thank him and jot down the ingredients on a piece
of paper.&nbsp; You require :
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">1 Diamond</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">1 Star Ruby</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">1 Pearl</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">1 Fire Emerald from Firiona Vie</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">1 Sapphire</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">1 Fire Opal</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">2 Enchanted Platinum Bars.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Chapter 8 :</b> You replenish your supplies in Freeport and head out to
gather the gems required to bury this Hero with Honour.&nbsp; After a few
battles, and an empty bank, you hand Ping the gems and within the week has the
coffin prepared.&nbsp; You know you must find Simon Aldicott, a Cleric who will
complete the burial with Prayers and Blessings.&nbsp; He is in West Commons and
you find him fishing by the Lake.&nbsp; You greet him and open up the coffin.&nbsp;
Placing all of the Hero's bones within the coffins walls, you hand Simon the
coffin and he begins to pray to Marr for this Hero's soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><b>Chapter 9 :</b> While Simon continues the Ceremony, you hear a fitful yell
and see someone you know as Darak Lightforge charging towards Simon, blade in
hand.&nbsp; You leap into the path and enter a great melee with Darak.&nbsp; He
is a great warrior and puts you to the test.&nbsp; When you finally find an
opening in his defense, you are spent as your blade bites deep, ending the fight
and Darak's life.&nbsp; You retrieve Darak's remains and hand them to Simon.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Simon stands from his Prayers and thanks you for saving his life.&nbsp; He tells
you he must continue the Ceremony for the Hero and hands you a fine scroll,
sealed with wax and neatly written.&nbsp; He tells you this scroll should be
memorized and put into your Spell Book.&nbsp; It will offer you a Blessing upon
any Blade you wield, granting extra damage in the name of Righteousness.&nbsp;
<p>Spell is <b><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon/spells/spelldescriptions.asp?Id=1411">Divine
Might</a></b>, lasts approximately 17 minutes and is a proc that stacks with any
effects on your weapons, causing 65 points of Direct Damage.</p>
