</tr>
<tr> 
<td width='80%'><P>It was raining in the town of Freeport. Another humid day; 
for the winds from Ro blow north at this time of year. I looked outside the Hall 
of Truth and watched as those horrible militiamen go about their evil 
deeds...</P>
<P>The young Templar Zanto walked to the shrine of Mithaniel 
Marr and knelt, he whispered to the statue, " I shall not fail you." and with 
that the young, wholehearted Paladin walks out to begin his journey to the dark 
swamps to recover the Gift from Marr....Ghoulbane.</P>
<P>As Zanto leaves Freeport he gathers his supplies, some 
banded armor, a shield, a fine steel sword and his holy rings and heads south 
for the recesses of Guk and the nearby Innothule swamp. Zanto leaves for the 
swamp ready for anything. Feeling danger lurking behind every corner, it is hard 
to trust anyone from outside the guards....but instead of acting paranoid Zanto 
must act strong and proud. Like the true nature of a Paladin he takes out a 
scroll rolled up in his pack and gazes at it, it is a map giving direction to 
the Oasis of Marr and then to the Swamps.</P>
<P>Uh-Oh... as he rolls up the scroll standing in front of him 
is the true reason he became a Paladin....to banish evil, and evil was standing 
in front of him! In front of Zanto stood an 8 foot tall, smelly, green, Troll 
ShadowKnight, in his hand he holds a steel blade as black as night.</P>
<P>&quot;Hehe littole humies shount be standin here without his 
buddies, too bad...me have to bash you now..."</P>
<P>"Do your worst, you evil, flea ridden, overgrown, 
whelp!"</P>
<P>And with that Zanto unsheathed his sword preparing for 
combat...as steel clanged against steel Zanto hit the Troll over the head with 
his shield and slashed open his leg...the Ttroll fell like a Mage in Dwarven 
platemail...Zanto inched in and delivered a final blow to the Trolls neck. Zanto 
knelt and grabbed the black blade from the Trolls hand.</P>
<P>"He wont be needing this anymore...the Hall of Truth will 
love to see this."</P>
<P>As Zanto continues walking he sees a giant black Tower in 
the backround, was it?....YES it was! It was the Oasis of Marr! He had made it 
halfway! As Zanto knelt down by the cool water he removed his helm and splashed 
some cool water on his face, taking a sip from the stream.</P>
<P>" What a relief," another voice said, " I havent seen a 
person in days!"</P>
<P>As Zanto turned his head he saw a beautiful young 
woman.</P>
<P>"Hello, my name is Trathania and you?"</P>
<P>Zanto gazed at the woman for a moment, saw her flowing 
robes, a small dagger, and the top of a holy spellbook peering out of her 
pack...she was a cleric.</P>
<P>"My name is Zanto, Hail and Well Met, unfortunately I must 
be going, a long journey stretches in front of me."</P>
<P>"Where are you headed?"</P>
<P>"I'm going to the evil lands known only as Guk to recover a 
sword that doesn't belong in such an evil place"</P>
<P>"I see...well these harsh lands should not be traveled by 
one alone... you look like you can use a companion."</P>
<P>"What are you implying?" Zanto questioned.</P>
<P>"May i come along?"</P>
<P>And with that Zanto stood up helped Trathania up and they 
both started heading south once again. A few days later the air gets humid and 
light dims as they leave the dry desert air and enter the swamplands....Few men 
and women have even made it this far.</P>
<P>Suddenly 4 Frogluks leaped out of hiding and surrounded 
Zanto and Trathania, without even thinking Zanto took his sword and ran through 
one of the Frogluks while parrying a blow from another Frogluk. Trathania 
started concentrating and then released a powerful spell named Smite, killing a 
Frogluk instantly. Meanwhile Zanto dodged another blow and bashed the next 
Frogluk and sliced his body faster than one could blink. Trathania then cast 
Daring on Zanto and Zanto took care of the final Frogluk</P>
<P>They both could barely see at that point so Trathania cast 
Halo of Light on them both as the ventured into the deep murky jungle and 
marshland. He saw a blade standing on a marble pedestal draped with vines. 
Before him lay GhoulBane! The gift from Marr.</P>
<P>Zanto and Trathania hugged and started to celebrate...but 
maybe all too soon... A large frogluk in chain armor walked over to the pedestal 
and grabbed the sword and held it in front as if prepared for combat!</P>
<P>"How can this be?!", Zanto shouted, puzzled, "Only Paladins 
may wield this sword!"</P>
<P>"Maybe he is a Paladin!" Trathania exclaimed</P>
<P>"Maybe, but that does not stop me...Trathania stand back, 
this battle is my own and no others."</P>
<P>Zanto stepped into combat against the Frogluk Paladin. they 
moved around in circles until the Frogluk struck, Zanto blocked but his shield 
was shattered! He had to fight this battle steel to steel. *clang* *voosh* 
*cling* *clang* The Paladins fought for 10 minutes, no further than they were at 
the beggining. Suddenly the Frogluk feints a move but goes the other way and 
catches Zanto offguard!</P>
<P>&quot;AGGG!&quot;</P>
<P>Zanto's arm was cut badly but he continued fighting and then 
the Frogluk, being tired from battle made a clumsy move and Zanto slammed him 
with his fist, making the Frogluk fall and then a final blow to the back, 
impaling the Frogluk. There was a final squeal and Zanto knelt beside the 
Frogluk and removed GhoulBane from his hand and picked it up. Zanto felt a surge 
of power through his veins and knew that he was unstoppable now. Zanto sat down 
and Layed Hands on himself and stood up, held his sword up high and yelled, 
"Another day, another Victory for the holy knights of Norrath.....The 
Paladin!"</P>
