  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>So. You have made it to your second circle of spells, and are no longer a newbie. Hopefully by now you have come to understand your role as tank and holy warrior, and have saved many grateful lives with your LOH. A good paladin will be disgusted when he must use it to save himself. It's a good time to find reliable friends to group with, as you will be fighting with others for the majority of the rest of your levels. <P>
With this cirle comes your fist DD spell, ward undead. Head to oasis and get in a group fighting orcs and mummies. You can camp the north border of oasis and pull mummies, madmen, scarabs and of course orcs to that spot no problem. This will be the best killing/no risk spot you'll probably ever find, so appreciate it while you can. With your sense undead you can track down the nearest undead mob, although often you will only find someone's pet. Feel free to chain burn your mana on ward, as you should have a real healer in your group. Make sure you taunt the mobs off your casters, and use the trust flash of light to help turn them back to you. Get used to taking lots of damage and depending on a healer. You can stay in oasis pulling there for several levels, and move to the usually pretty camped crocs and deep water caimens. They don't cast, don't train, and will walk right by you killing one of their own. They do move fast over land and water, so don't expect to be able to outrun them. And of course, we can't talk about oasis without mentioning the ever present sand giants and spectre's, who look very cool while they're killing you. Pay attention to shouts of warnings, it will save your life. You can sell to the gypsies in the center of the zone, and even buy water and food. Very convenient. <P>
At level 20 the xp starts to slow down, and I bounced around a bit till I came to unrest. For those who hate dying, I suggest lake rathe and some aviak guards. Very timable spawns and easy hunting. Terribly boring though, and upon entering most people shout for a camp check, as each spawn is on a differnt island and usually camped. Unrest offers great loot, a fast pace, and trains. Lots of trains. After a while people figure out that there's no point in complaining about trains there, as there are so many spawns that aggro on each other that a bad pull quickly becomes 7 or more angry mobs comin right for ya. Get yourself bound near the zone line to BB in greater fay, and be prepared to make the run once in a while. I've been in unrest from 20 to 31, and made well over 1k pp. That will triple as soon as I get my dwarven booties :D <P>
At level 20 most of the house spawns will be red to you except the first floor. You will want to avoid trains at all costs, as even a death beetle train can take your group down. It's a relatively long run to the zone line, so start early. There are 2 mazes of shrubberies when you get to the front of the house, next to 2 pools. have your group sit inside the left maze near the far left corner.. trains will never find you, and there is enough room to fight. Have your puller (invis to undead if possible) go into the side porch double doors. there is a round room at the back with 4 spawns, as well as one near the door. The yard trash, as it has come to be known, will jump in on your pulls until you hit 25 or higher, so be sure to have a puller smart enough to run a bad pull to the zone instead of to you. Soon you will be getting great exp, warding undead left and right, and slowly moving into rooms in the house to camp. Soon after or around 20 you can take the back room, but be careful because many trains can come through there, both going out and returning to their spawn points. The middle room is good at 23+, and provides lots of action and fewer train worries. You can also begin to get in groups camping the ghoul magi. Once you hit 20 you can still get good xp grouping with up to 10 levels above you, and while some classes report differing results, in my experience it has *always* been better xp grouping with more powerful players. Not only can they teach ya stuff, but you can burn your ward undead on those undead and still do enough damage to get an equal split of xp. A capable cleric or druid is a must in a group in unrest. And always know the fastest escape route, because you will be running for it. A lot. <P>
When you get to 26 or so, you can go to the tower and bar, and even the altar. A full group of 26's would have a tough time, but you should have no trouble in a group with 28+ in those locales, and your ac and hp and ward undead will make you a useful addition. 
When you get up to 29 or so, much of the house is green to you, and you will only find truly good xp in the tower, altar or ghost room. The ghost is a 35th level dwarf who drops jagged bands and the occasional dwarven work boots. These you will wear for a long time and can sell for 1800p. He is camped 24/7, and there is a waiting list. Simply shout for the leader, put your name on the list and occupy yourself as best you can. Remeber all those crazy fights that seemed like non-stop action? It will seem like horse compared to the nba finals when you get to the ghost room. Luckily most of your party will be over 34 or so, and should know the place well. You will find dark terrors, hags a plenty, greater dark bones, werebats, and of course ol general rucksif. He spawns every 20-22 minutes and a good group will work on having the place cleared for his arrival so they can nuke him fast. No group will be without a healer here. Use your stun on the hags, and you new expulse undead. It won't be resisted much at all, and can really help bring down an undead mob. The ghost room will continue to be great xp/loot for several more levels, when you can get in. It has just about become time to say goodbye to unrest. From here I would suggest cazic thule, split paw, and guk. I don't recommend MistMoore castle, as the trains there are often 40+ and very fast. They can almost all see invis, none are undead, and the trained mobs stay at the zone for up to 10 minutes before returning. It will make you pine for the wussy trains of unrest. Eventually you will have to come here for your soulfire, but I would stay out of it for at least a few more levels. <P>
If you think the best part about eq is the similarities to quake, love to feel your pulse pound and get rewarded with excellent loot you can use, This is the guide for you. Unrest can get camped at times, and when the population drops below 30 can get pretty scary as the house fills up. As with any zone, read up on it on the various sites and print out a map. Familiarize yourself with the jargon for the locations so you can find things and escape when needed. <P>
Good luck to you holy warrior, give me a tell if you need any advice on the bertoxxulous server. <P>
