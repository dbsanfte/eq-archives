<p></p>
<p>I have done many new things since my last entry.  I have made several journeys between Antonica and Faydwer, and have met many new friends.  One of the most noble of these is a human barbarian by the name of Ravenflight Sabretooth.  He is a shaman of his people, and I have found that his magic, based on the nature of animals, is very useful indeed.  I met him while hunting Deathfist Orcs in the plains known as East Commons.  After fighting the orcs for a little while, he told me about a group of bandits known as Dervishes, scattered throughout the Commons and Desert of Ro.  Since the orcs were well contained by other local adventurers, we decided to take on the Dervs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We spent quite a bit of time fighting the Dervishes in several different camps.  I found that my skills increased much more quickly as I fought these villains... but they proved to be tough opponents, and I found myself defeated more than once.  One bandit in particular I must mention is a dark elf named Dorn B'Dynn.  Even both Ravenflight and I could not defeat him... if you should cross his path and have no one to assist you, I would suggest a hasty retreat.  I plan to return someday and send him to his Dark Lord, but there have been more important tasks as of late.  We picked up a lot of nice equipment from the Dervishes also, which helped to fill my coffers somewhat.  Lately, though, I have found that to better aid the cause of Light, I should be helping those with less experience than I.  So I have been giving the bronze axes and raw-hide armor pieces I have found to some humans just beginning their adventures.  I like heading outside Freeport's gates and seeing the youthful warriors putting their new equipment to good use (at the expense of Deathfist pawns, of course).</p>
<p></p>
<p>One day Ravenflight came to me while I was in the tunnel connecting East Commons with the Northern Desert of Ro, and told me of an oasis located south from where we were.  In this oasis he had heard of an Orc temple where there was literally an army of Orc Warriors guarding it!  I may not have believed him, but he said that he himself had seen the many orcs and this very temple itself!  Intrigued, I followed him through the desert to this grand oasis, and the orcs themselves.  On the way, Ravenflight told me of other denizens there that we would actually WANT to avoid.  Sand giants and terrible specters, dry bones skeletons and crypt mummies all wandered the hills of the Oasis, making just being there a threat to your life in and of itself.  He said that as much danger as there was, this was the place for a warrior looking to improve himself to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We entered the Oasis, and made our way through the giant dune to where he said the temple was located.  When we passed a camp of gypsies and ran down a short hard-packed path, we came upon a couple of camps of adventurers looking over the dunes at what must have been the most orcs I have ever seen... even in Crushbone.  They were patrolling everywhere!  We all knew that we couldn't take them all at once, even though there were plenty of us.  But we could reduce their number by plucking off stragglers and small patrols.  Ravenflight and I joined a party sitting near a large stone spire by the lake itself (the reason this area is called the Oasis of Marr, I assume), and readied for the battle ahead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or should I say <i>battles</i> ahead.  I consider myself a stout, hardy warrior who has seen combat with many types of foes... even several at the same time.  But in the Oasis, there was no end.  We fought Orc after Orc, with Orc Priests healing them from behind, and huge Orc Warriors jumping in to make the fight that much more difficult.  What's more, there's plenty of undead who wander the land, and as soon as they would see us, they'd join the fray as well.  Why one time, the fighting was so intense that we merged with a nearby party, and I could see nothing except a sea of metal armor and yellow orc vests.  I could do nothing but swing my mighty axe at anything yellow, and hope that a fellow adventurer hadn't stained his armor.  Over time, I saw many comrades go down, and I even was knocked out a couple of times myself.  But I got used to the constant flow of battle, and even grew to like it.  I was learning tactics and strategies faster than ever before, and I was making many friends doing it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you're looking for a great place to hunt evil, this is it.  Watch out for the giants and specters though; heed the warnings of your fellow players.  I have seen a giant flatten the hardiest of warriors flat in seconds, and there was nothing I could do except flee for my life.  The specters are at least as bad, if not more.  Their terrible scythes can cleave a man in two, armor and all.  I have been lucky enough to avoid this fate, but I have seen others who were not so... and I still shudder at the thought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ravenflight woke me from a short nap after a long day fighting a few weeks ago.  He said that during his sleep, a spirit came to him and granted him the ability to channel more of their energy through his magic!  He said that to get the spells he could now cast, he would need to go to his homeland of Halas.  I asked if I could make the journey with him... after all, he was a close friend, and I wanted to explore more of the world.  We left that very night, and crossed the desert into the Commons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We made our way into West Commons, where there stands a circle of Druidical power.  From here, from what I had heard, the druids of Norrath can magically transport someone over great distances.  I have to admit, I was, and still am, somewhat skeptical about this process, but Ravenflight assured me that he had done this before, and there would be nothing to worry about.  Choking down my reservations, I followed along.  We met up with a druid he had contacted earlier, who had agreed to take us to North Karana... somewhere I had never been.  This was apparently the closest spot she could get us to Halas.  She told us to stand close, and she cast her spell of travel.  I remember feeling quite queasy for a few moments, and seeing everything around me spin rapidly.  Then my vision melted, and returned in ripples like when a stone is thrown in the river.  When I could see clearly again, I saw vast, rolling grasslands, sparse trees, and heard many unfamiliar cries of wild animals.  I assumed that this was our destination.  Ravenflight paid the druid for her service, and she disappeared shortly after.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remember hearing somewhere that the Karanas were cursed with a never-ending plague.  I'm not sure whether or not this is true, but I did notice feeling almost like I was suffering from a summer cold the whole time I was there.  At first I thought it was an after-affect from the magical journey, but upon reflection I realized that my symptoms stopped pretty much immediately after crossing into the hills of Qeynos.  Very strange.  And to make matters worse, there are griffins hunting the wildlife throughout the land... and I guess that dwarves and barbarians look remarkably like "food" to them.  No sooner did we find out way to the path leading to the human city of Qeynos, then did a pair of griffaws (young griffins) ambush us!  We fought as much as we could, but I fell after being sufficiently clawed and buffeted.  I was lucky, however, that I did not end up as scraps in the beast's belly.  I awoke sometime later in Freeport, some distance from Karana and my equipment.  Ravenflight was there as well; I assume he suffered a similar fate.  After chuckling over the incident and blessing our good fortune at still being alive, we ventured out to try and get another teleport back to North Karana.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our second venture was considerably more successful.  We found another druid who agreed to take us to Karana without payment, since everything we had was somewhere in the grass.  After arriving, we found our equipment quickly, and ran across the grasslands to the Qeynos Hills.  Instead of immediately going north to Halas, Ravenflight turned south to Qeynos to purchase some supplies for the remainder of our journey.  While we were there, we saw the most incredible thing.  As I stood outside the gates waiting for Ravenflight, I saw one of the dark Priests of Discord walking out to the grasslands.  He was fist-fighting a member of the Silent Fist, an order of human monks.  Needless to say, he got knocked flat by the monk.  I was amazed at what I saw; why were they fighting?  Next thing I saw, ANOTHER monk was brawling with a guard!  I began to think that the monks had all gone rogue and were attacking the citizens of Qeynos… but then I saw a man standing near the gates laughing to himself wholeheartedly.  I approached him and inquired about what I was witnessing before me.  He looked at me with a gleam in his eye, and told me to watch.  He runs off briefly, and comes back with another monk in tow, and points at the guard; the monk immediately jumps into the fight as well!  It was at this point that I realized I was most likely dealing with an enchanter.  As much social disorder as he was causing, I still found the whole episode amusing.  Humans are a strange lot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We left Qeynos and went north to Halas.  We crossed through the gnoll’s home of Blackburrow, which was the fastest way to get to Ravenflight’s home.  I expected to have to defend myself from the legions of gnoll guards undoubtedly patrolling the area, but to my surprise, they did not attack.  I could see them glaring at me, but they must have been intimidated by my holy power.  Cowardly dogs.  In any case, we made it through Blackburrow unscathed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we left the mouth of the cave, we were greeted by a sight I had never seen up until then.  Sheets and sheets of ice covered the ground, and snow fell lightly from the sky.  I have honestly never seen anything like it, having lived in the caverns of Kaladim my whole life.  As beautiful as it was, I can’t imagine ever wanting to live there; besides being nothing but white all the time, I have to question why anyone would want to live in the constant cold.  In any case, we crossed through the cold valleys and eventually came upon a raft crossing a small lake or moat.  Ravenflight explained that the main gates of the city were across this lake, so we climbed on the raft and paddled our way there.  I have to wonder how the buildings withstand the snow and the wind… it is human construction, after all.  The barbarians are a boisterous lot.  I heard singing and brawling and things I would rather not mention here resounding through the streets.  But they were all friendly, even to an outsider such as myself.  I followed Ravenflight through the streets to what was really nothing more than an alcove cut right from the mountains (must have been dwarves), which he said was where the Shamans congregated.  I waited for him just outside, as he went in to commune with his fellows and purchase the spells now available to him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After a few hours, he met me back outside, and we decided to spend the night in the city before heading back.  I was more than agreeable, and I fell asleep in the house of a friend of Ravenflight’s.  The next morning, I found him right outside the hut fishing, apparently waiting for me to begin our journey.  I guess he had already said his goodbyes, for as soon as we met up at the pier, we made our way back to Oasis.<p/>
<p></p>
<p>Although I can’t say I’d ever want to live in Halas, I imagine he might say the same for Kaladim.  After all, how is he supposed to get his big, chunky body through it’s halls?  I jest, of course.  Ravenflight is a honorable friend and a fierce warrior, and I am glad to have him as a companion.  Now it’s time to pray and rest… back to battling Orcs tomorrow.</p>
