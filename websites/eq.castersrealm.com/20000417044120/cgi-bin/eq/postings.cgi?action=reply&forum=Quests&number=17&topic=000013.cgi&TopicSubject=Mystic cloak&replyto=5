[B]I was wondering if any one else finds it not only aggrivating but also depressing that we must wait 55min for a 10% chance of the spawn you need. I mean the whole quest is no drop items even  the Mystic Cloak, so why not have the Priest spawn every 15min, or atleast let him spawn once you enter his zone if you trigger the quest. I can not play for 5 or 6 hours a night and this really robs me of completeing many of the quest due to such slow spawn rate of the NPC'c that have a component I need. If I did not look on the web and find out how long it takes for the spawn to occur I would have thought it was broken. I can understand slower spawn or more rare spawn for items the are dropable or can be sold, this would swamp the economy with rare items and cause a major camp out at those locations if it was not slow or rare. But come on this is a no drop quest so why not let the NPC spawn regular enough that if you were doing the quest it could be completed in one night or maybe two. The only other solution I can find is maybe allow the keys that priest drops to be dropable, like the rings that gynok drops in befallen. Atlest this way I could pay some godawful amount of money to get the key. But atleast I could get it. This is not just me but many of the people I talk to that have families and work can not complete any of the good quest due to this problem.

The point is to make it a rare and hard to get item.  You think that if you spend 15 minutes camping a spot and kill the Priest of Najena, that you deserve the Mystic Cloak?!??!? Give me a break.  <P>I cannot think of a better cloak for a caster outside of the Plane of Hate/Fear.  And you want the spawn on a 15 minute timer.  You get out of the game what you put into it.  You want to spend 15 minutes killing something, you should get a piece of junk item.  You spend 8 hours camping the priest, you get a damn nice and rare No-drop cloak.  Put some time into the game if you want the best item in the game on your back.  If not, wear your lizzie cloak or whatever it is you have and be happy.  Those who REALLY want the cloak will spend several hours on a lazy Sunday camping the spawn.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Arke</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well I am sorry but I have a life outside of EQ. Besides you could sit all day there and still not get the key off the priest. My point is if they want people to do quests they have to make it possible for people to complete in a reasonable amount of time. I dont know about you but I would rather play the game for my 10 bucks a month then sit in one spot for 8 or 10 or 20 hours to get a nice item. The point of the game is to travel around experience the world and complete quest. Not sit for a day in RL in one location to get one sinlge item. If it were, then they should call it Ever Camp. I played this past weekend in Unrest I was on saturday almost 12 hours and this I admit is rare for me to play so long. But the priest only spawned one time in 12 hours, that is crazy. I have a lvl 50 wizzy friend who is bound there and pops in and out regularly try to get the priest and he still has not gotten it. I think for me to complete a quest is more important then the item it yields. I just want to complete the quest in one day and not 3 weeks.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"> Not mad just frustrated</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Durae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Arke, <P>I tend to agree with you.  I work full-time which means 45+ hours a week.  I have a family, friends, home, cleaning, laundry, shopping, cooking, volunteer work with my church, edit a newsletter, and am involved with a professional group.  If I somehow could even begin to find four hours to play daily (7:00 PM - 11:00) and could live without family and friends, then I too might be able to 'camp' something for that wonderful diamond-encrusted-mystic-shoestring-that-procs-everlasting-sow-and-gives-30AC-while-playing-the-theme-to-chariots-of-fire.<P>But 'camping' doesn't seem like fun to me, and certainly doesn't seem like it what was planned when EQ was designed.  I don't understand why spawn locations aren't random and why more than one NPC can't drop a particular item.  Certainly, obtaining that diamond-crusted-widget should be a crowning achievement that requires significant effort, but why is that effort sitting on one's gluteous-maximus in one location for 20 hours rather than (gasp) questing...as in (can you imagine this concept) Ever-Quest?  Make me run all over Norrath, across continents through each and every city if need be.  <P>I look for entertainment and diversion in the game.  I'm willing to 'work' at it...but to 'sit' at it?

Its so much more fun to get a group and slowly move through a dungeon and clear stuff out.  Try it sometime and see how much fun it it.  <P>Finding that rare spawn or special monster should be spontaneous and random both in location and time.  <P>For those of you who are actually complaining about camp times and calling everquest evercamp maybe you should try this train of thought.  Is it everquest that is forcing you to camp, or your desire for items which has made everquest become itemquest for you?<P>Just some friendly advice.<P>-Fzull</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kelton</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Good point Fzull. "Is it everquest that is forcing you to camp, or your desire for items which has made everquest become itemquest for you?"<P>You don't NEED the cloak to have fun on EQ.  You don't HAVE to have the best item for every slot in your inventory.  Its YOUR choice if you want to put in the time or not.  You should have just as much fun whether its a lizzie cloak or a mystic cloak on your back.<P>If you want to put in some time and a little dedication, you get a nice reward for it.  The AVERAGE spawn on the Priest is 1 in 8 spawns, every 53 minutes.  So on average, about 7-8 hours will yeild 1 Priest of Najena, which ALWAYS drops the key you need for the quest.  You may get the Priest in 2 hours, or it may take 10 hours, but the overall average is still 7-8 hours.  Its YOUR choice if you would rather go shopping that Saturday or iron or mill about the house or go watch that basketball game, because you do not NEED that item to have fun in everquest.  You can camp the Priest on Sat, do you chores on Sunday, or vice versa.  It all boils down to how bad you want that particular item, but there are many many people out there that have fun with the game, regardless that they don't have the best cloak on their back outside of the Plane of Fear/Hate.  But don't complain when you're making the choice of not camping the item.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Livius</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">But why should it be that way Kelton? Granted it's our choice to get the item or not and we certainly can choose not to....up to a point. As casters we have a lower reliance on equip. than other classes. Take a level 50 rogue, put him in banded and hand him a combine dagger and you'll have a dead rogue in minutes. He *HAS* to get the better weapons/armor to survive and they have to wait hours for some spawns just like us. This is a game and should be fun. I don't find sitting in one place for hours waiting for something to be there fun and I suspect most other's don't as well. Items in everquest should be treated just like in economics: There is no discernment between luxuries and necessities. It's all necessity and should be provided in a manner that different playstyles can acquire. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Arke</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think my point was missed to some extent. I do play EQ all the time without camping, if I only camped I would not be lvl 34. One of my major points is that this game is a game of QUEST i.e. EverQUEST. Therefore I want to be able to complete a quest in a reasonable amount of time, not 10 hours or more. Kelton you say it spawns 1 in 8 hours. That means I have about a 0% chance of getting to the spawn before the other 65 people in the zone. And because I do play EQ and not just sit and camp I am usually off playing down in the basement killing stuff.There is no possible way to get to the Priest before 10 other people are already blasting it. Yes I could Memblur and blast to steal it but that is not my style of playing. One question that I have for the people of this board, is IF like some say they play the game and run around and not just camp, what does it matter if the priest spawns ever 15 min and all the casters that DO the QUEST obtain the reward. If so many people play the game just to have fun then why does it matter if the priest spawns more often? I will tell you why, by makeing the quest almost impossible to complete, or atleast VERY time consuming, you will play the game more and for a longer time to complete the quest, you so desire to finish. And by doing this you pay to play longer. I am not here to bash verant about this so dont spam me. <P>I am not the type to cry about nerfs or what other classes get that I dont but I am here to say that if you want to sell a game on the basis that it is full of quest to complete, then let us complete them. I personally dont care if every caster in the game has a NO DROP mystic Cloak. No drop items are going to effect the economy very little so whats the big deal. I dont care if some classes can do thing that I can do and could not when the game came out. The reason why I dont care is simple. Because I enjoy playing the game and NOT camping only. But I think that if you are not going to let people complete a quest simply because the reward is to nice for everyone to have then dont make it a quest. Put it on a dragon if it is so dang nice and let only lvl 50's get it. But dont make it a 2 month ordeal for us to complete simply because it is to nice of an item to have all over the server. This game is sold as a large world to explore and many quest to complete, yet to do so you must play 24x7 or CAMP, which I dont want to do. So please Verant live up to your title and let us finish a quest in lets say 4 hours  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"> Well sorry for it being so long.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
