	  <td width='100%'><font face='verdana' size='2pt'><p>I would like to start by introducing myself.  As I said, I am now called Baggza T'Riks.  I say now, for this was not always my name.  I was born Tazel T'Riks, Jr., son of an influential family in my hometown of Neriak.  My parents, Tazel Sr. and Myrna T'Riks, had one other child, a son by the name of Tzurn.  They taught us well in the ways of our people, educating us in the worship of Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate.  They encouraged us to become necromancers and follow the family tradition.</p>
<p>Growing up, my brother and I were inseparable.  We attended the Academy of The Dead together, and showed quite different proficiencies.  I was more successful in our magic-related studies, whereas Tzurn excelled in our religion classes.  I must say that the concept of magic fascinated me, and, after a time I could concentrate on little else.  I began to neglect my religion homework, much to the dismay of my parents.  I realized that I was not fond of death, nor the dead.  In fact, these concepts frightened me.  I began to dread attending our religion classes, which had begun to focus on our training as necromancers.  I found excuses to avoid the class, and succeeded, for the most part.</p>
<p>Then, one day, our teacher confronted me.  During our discussion, it came out that I did not want to be a necromancer.  He immediately called a conference with my parents and the school headmaster.  My mother cried during the meeting, but my father just sat in stony silence.  I knew that I had disappointed them, and I felt horrible.  Yet I could not ignore my own desires.  I found myself completely unsuited to the worship of Innoruuk, as I knew that hate led only to destruction.  My love of creation precluded this idea.</p>
<p>The headmaster pressured me to decide what I would do with my life, if I would not become a necromancer.  I considered the different schools available in Neriak.  I knew that the way of the warrior could never be mine, as it seemed also to be geared toward destruction.  To become a cleric would not suit me, for then I would be dependent on Innoruuk for my powers.  The shadow knight was never an option.</p>
<p>I realized that I could follow none of the occupations respected by most Teir'Dal.  I explained this to the headmaster, and he shook his head and sighed.  "Then I suppose you must become one of the Spurned, young Tazel."</p>
<p>I knew, having been indoctrinated from a young age, that the life of a Spurned One was the life of a nomad.  My parents would surely reject me.  I would be unable to reverse this decision.  Yet I knew I had no other choice.  I summoned my courage, looked the headmaster in the eye, and said, "Then I shall become one of the Spurned."</p>
<p>My parents were shocked.  My father swore under his breath and scowled at me.  The headmaster nodded and began to make the arrangements for my expulsion from the training grounds of The Dead.  My mother, through her tears, insisted that I be given more time, be able to take back what I had said, but the headmaster explained that it was not possible.  This was a policy laid down by the King and Queen, and could not be reversed for anyone.  Once I had uttered those words, there was no taking them back.</p>
<p>On our travel home, my father didn't say a word.  My mother continued to cry.  I walked, lost in thought.  Had I made the right choice?  It felt right, but what did that mean?</p>
<p>When we arrived home, my father turned to me.  "You may collect one change of clothes.  Then, leave, and never come back."  He turned as if to go.</p>
<p>I stared at him.  "Father, I-"</p>
<p>He rounded on me, and I thought he would strike, but instead, he said, "Who are you to call me father?  I have but one living son, and his name is Tzurn.  You wear the face of my other son, but he is dead."</p>
<p>That was the last thing my father said to me.  I went to the room I shared with Tzurn and gathered the change of clothes.  My younger brother stared at me.  Instinctively, he seemed to know what had happened.  "I can't believe you did that!  Do you realize what you're throwing away?  The pain you're causing our parents?"  He seemed to want to say more, but stopped, waiting for a response from me.</p>
<p>I knew I could not change his mind about it.  "Our parents?  They are not my parents any more.  Did you not hear your father say that?"  With that, I picked up the small bag with my things in it and walked, determined, out of the room.  I shut the door slowly behind me, and began walking down the street.  I walked for about ten minutes, and then found a nice, secluded spot in an alley, and sat down and cried.</p>
<p>I wanted to distance myself from my family as much as I could.  I knew I could not keep my name, for it would remind me of my father every time someone spoke it.  I decided I would take a pseudonym, a false name, and use that forever more.  It should be something simple, yet convey my desires.  I wanted to become rich and famous, and show my parents that it was possible to be successful without being a necromancer.  I decided I would call myself Baggza Munney.</p>
<p>After a time, I realized that I had to find my way to the hall of the Spurned.  I walked for quite some time, afraid to ask for directions.  I searched around, and, hidden behind some buildings, up a ramp, I found a three-story building.  The man seated outside saw me approach, and he stood, frowning.</p>
<p>He growled at me, "What do you want here, young one?"</p>
<p>"Please, sir, I am looking for the hall of the Spurned."  The trepidation in my voice must have been obvious.</p>
<p>His frown deepened.  "Well, you have found it, although I think it would be better if you had not."  He snorted.  "Those who pass through this door cannot undo that mistake."</p>
<p>I shook from fear.  "I have made my choice, sir."</p>
<p>"Very well, then.  Go on in, Spurned!"  With that, he sat back down.</p>
<p>I did as I was told.  The door creaked open, and I walked in.  I saw a well kept, though poorly furnished, room.  There was a small, faded run in the center of the room, on top of the stones in the floor.  One stairway in the back led down, the other up.  A few dark elves were seated around in the room, and they stared at me as I entered.</p>
<p>"Can I help you, young one?"  This came from an older man who sat on a large chair that floated a bit above the ground.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."  I was surprised my teeth did not chatter.  "I am looking for the hall of the Spurned."</p>
<p>"Well, I think you have found it," he said, "although you can forget about that word, Spurned.  No one inside these walls uses it."  Then he smiled.  "Come over here and let me have a look at you."</p>
<p>I did as I was told.  He did not move, only stared at me.  "I want to see what you're made of, young one.  What is your name?"</p>
<p>"Tazel," I began, but then I remembered my resolution.  "Baggza, I mean."</p>
<p>"Do you have what it takes to be rejected by everyone around you?"</p>
<p>"I-I think so, sir."  I stammered my way through my expulsion from the Academy of the Dead and my parents' rejection.</p>
<p>He nodded as I finished.  "Your story is very similar to mine.  I came here when I was not much older than you.  I think you will do nicely here."  He coughed.  "Tell me, where does your interest lie?"</p>
<p>"Magic, sir."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I know that.  What I mean is, what do you like most about magic?"</p>
<p>I thought about this for a few minutes.  "I like to be able to cast spells that help others.  My favorite spell is one that I learned in school.  It takes strength from me and shares it with someone else.  I can't do it very well, yet, but with some practice-"</p>
<p>"No, I think that should be fine, young Baggza.  I believe we will start your training as an enchanter.  You may, if you wish, change your mind later, but I think this will be most in line with your interests."</p>
<p>With that, my course was decided.  I began to attend classes with a few other young dark elves, and I made a few friends.  The lines of magic we discussed in class were exactly what I had hoped for, and I decided that this would be my occupation.  I decided, however, that I would retain my original surname, for it fit better with my occupation.  After all, who has more tricks in his bags than an enchanter?</p>
