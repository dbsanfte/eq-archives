<tr> 
<td width='80%'><P>This document is intended to be an inclusive Paladin's 
guide. In it, I highlight the strengths and weakness of the Paladin class, and 
tell you what and what not to do to be effective. I have read all of the Paladin 
guides I know of, and while they all contain good information, none of them in
my opinion tell you all you need to know. Telling you your strengths and weaknesses is 
good, but none of them that I have read have told you what to actually do to 
minimize the weaknesses and use the strengths to their greatest advantage. I 
hope to do this. Let me be frank, Paladins are weaker generally in any role 
until after level 22. Playing a Paladin before this consists of knowing how to 
use your strengths and minimize your weaknesses. Some of this is heavily in my
opinion, 
and could be disputed. I don't cover how to act as a Paladin here, as it would 
make this too long.</P>
<P>The basic <B>strengths</B> of the Paladin are: 
<UL>
<LI>The ability to save the day in a way that no one else can 
with Lay Hands. This is possibly the best ability in the game. 
<LI>The ability to provide backup healing/buffing. 
<LI>The ability to Tank (which comes to full fruition at level 
20). 
<LI>The ability to (after level 15) be very effective against 
undead. 
<LI>The ability to solo pretty well. </LI></UL>
<P>The <B>weaknesses</B> are: 
<UL>
<LI>The ability to tank is not very good until level 20. 

<LI>Levelling is very slow. 
<LI>You do not get spells until relatively late in your 
career. </LI></UL>
<P><B>Starting as a Paladin</B></P>
<P>Paladins need STR (for plate armor) and WIS (for mana) 
primarily.</P>
<P>I would say that an 85 STR is minimum to carry loot and wear 
armor (and even then you will need buffing magics probably).</P>
<P>Having less than a 90 or so WIS begins to degrade the 
primary benefit of a Paladin, which is the healing/buffing/undead DD/Undead Lull 
ability. If you leave WIS at 60, why not just be a Warrior?</P>
<P>Racially, each choice has it's pros and cons. I refer you to 
other guides concerning races as they are much better than anything I could give 
you here (try <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/creationguides/paladin.asp">http://eq.castersrealm.com/creationguides/paladin.asp</a>). I chose a High Elf for
roleplay purposes, but 
a Dwarf or Human are arguably the best choices. 
<UL>
<LI>At level 1 drop 5 points into 1 handed slash. This isn't 
essential but it gives you a nice headstart. Maybe one or two into Taunt is 
helpful as well. 
<LI>At level 4 I dropped 10 points into tailoring and did not 
regret it (but I wouldn't say this is necessary since you can buy Patchwork now 
for cheap. Back then hardly anyone knew how to tailor). If you don't you might 
want to consider dropping some into 2 handed slash. 
<LI>At level 6 I drop 10 points into Sense Heading. I guess you 
could build this from nothing but it takes forever, and Sense Heading is very 
valuable. 
<LI>At level 6, drop 1 point into Bash. 
<LI>At level 9 drop 1 point into Channelling, Divination, 
Alteration, and Abjuration. 
<LI>At level 10, drop 1 point into Dodge, 
<LI>At level 12, drop 1 point into Meditate. 
<LI>At level 15, save yourself a LOT of frustration and drop at 
least 10 points into Conjuration. Hammer of Wrath costs 50 mana and is your
  first Conjuration spell (i.e. you haven't built it up before now). Building it 
from base is hideously time consuming and wastes TONS of mana. Also drop at 
least 10 points into Evocation for Ward Undead if you can. 
<LI>At level 17, drop 1 point into Parry. 
<LI>At level 20, drop 20 points into Double Strike. 
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Starting out</B></P>
<P>I would solo until level 5 at least since this will usually 
get you to where you need to be the quickest. No matter where you are, kill 
everything in your path that will not hurt an important faction (like Pixie 
Tricksters for example). Stay near the guards if you need to run. You should at 
a minimum have full patchwork and a rusty weapon soon. Most any Newbie zone is 
ok at this level. Build both 1 and 2 handed slash at these levels.</P>
<P>Levels 5-9 are really hard. You will need friends that will 
let you group with then even though you hit less often and can't cast anything 
yet. Many powergamers will shun you (especially if you just used your Lay Hands) 
but hopefully some will be impressed by your brevity (you are selfless and 
willing to lay down your life to save another, right?). When you get a group of 
friends to adventure with, tank tank tank. Build Taunt. Try to keep the monsters 
off everyone else, even if you are not the only tank.</P>
<P>Other players will appreciate this. I always Taunt in combat 
unless I'm under two bubbles of health. Use your Lay Hands sparingly, but use 
it.</P>
<P>Don't hog it to yourself. I almost never waste my Lay Hands 
to defeat a tough monster I/we would otherwise not be able to kill. Save it for 
when a party member really needs it. You will make a lot of friends this way. 
Whenever I see a party member at less than a bubble in combat, I Lay On them. 
Your true usefulness now (and forever) is saving the day when no one else can. 
Almost no class can save the day like you can at this level (and none EVER in so 
dramatic a fashion). If you waste your Lay Hands to solo a tough monster, you 
will not be able to "save the day". Misty Thicket is where I was at this level, 
and I made out well there. If you have the patience, build 1 handed blunt. This 
isn't necessary, but it will save you time later.</P>
<P>Levels 6 you get Bash, and I <u>highly</u> recommend you use it. 
Don't listen to people who say Bash is useless. They are wrong when it comes to 
a Paladin and Bash. Bash may not be good for other classes, but it is <u>very</u>
good 
for you. It's especially useful with a Shiny Brass shield since you can Bash 
ghouls and such. I bash on an average or 6-8 points per hit. Complimented with a 
Combine weapon, you close the gap a little between those dual wielding, kicking 
fighters. Still not as good, but much better.</P>
<P>An additional recommendation-Don't use a Minotaur Axe. They 
are too slow for you as the only attack you have, and without Kick or Dual Wield 
you really pale in comparison to other tanks. Try to get a regular/steel/fine 
steel Longsword or Scimitar. You hit almost twice as fast for just a few points 
less damage per whack. As a Paladin, this will work out better. Trust me on this 
one.</P>
<P>Levels 9-12 are much better. You <i>finally</i> can heal and buff 
yourself, which are lifesavers. I recommend you spend a level or so soloing at 
level 9 to bring up your feeble magical skills (I did this in Misty Thicket on 
obs/spiders/wasps). By level 10 you should be good to go and are ready to be a 
more valuable asset to the group. Continue doing what you were doing before in 
groups, except now you can heal/cure disease/buff too. By now you should be 
making some decent cash. Start saving for a Combine Longsword/Scimitar and a 
Shiny Brass Shield. I know you are hating that newbie look by now, but you can 
live in leather armor until level 14-15 if you need to. Crushbone, Blackburrow, 
and Paw are good places for you at this level. Complimented with a Combine 
weapon, you close the gap a little between those dual wielding kicking fighters. 
Still not as good, but much better. I developed 2 handed slash until this level, 
then dropped it (left it at 65 or so) to use Bash. It's still high enough to 
pick it up again later this way. Meditate also makes the mana gain a lot faster, 
and Dodge is nice too. Good places for you now are Befallen and 
Unrest.</P>
<P>Levels 15-17 You get spell upgrades (yay!). Hammer of Wrath, 
Holy Armor, Cure Disease, Ward Undead, all are great assets and against undead 
you are a great benefit to any group. If you don't have that shiny Combine yet, 
Hammer of Wrath works just fine and is almost as good in fact. I did not build 1 
handed blunt until level 13 or so, and it went up slowly to start but it did go 
up. Ward Undead is an awesome spell and is the most efficient way to draw from 
distances and kill undead for you. Once again, you may want to solo a while to 
develop it. I cannot over-emphasize it's utility for you. Alone I use it mainly 
draw and finish off undead, keeping a store to heal myself in combat. In groups 
I burn it all onto them and between that and me hacking away I do a lot of 
damage.</P>
<P>If you don't have a Combine sword (or Hammer of Wrath handy 
with good 1 handed blunt skill), Shiny Brass Shield, and at least partial 
Banded/Ring/Chain armor, you need to make that top priority. You need all these 
IMO to do your job in a group. You definitely go up a bunch of notches on the 
usefulness scale at these levels, especially in places like Unrest and Befallen. 
I began to successfully lead and primary tank in groups around this 
level.</P>
<P>Levels 17-19 This is the final stretch for us brothers. At 
17 we get Parry which is a great addition. Not much else to say. Your mana has 
gotten to the point where you can do a very good amount of healing and dish out 
some serious justice to undead. From my observations, if you put stat points 
where I told you to, you should have a ton of the blue stuff in comparison to 
what your spells cost. People actually start looking for Paladins now. Unrest is 
still good but Befallen is probably too low level for you now. You will do well 
anywhere, but I still recommend you stick to undead areas.</P>
<P>Levels 20-22, and beyond. You made it. You finally get 
Double Strike and this closes the substantial gap between you and the Warrior in 
terms of dishing out damage. At this level your fighting ability is finally 
comparable to the other tanks. Level 22 Spells bring Root, Center, and 
Invisibility to Undead (among others). These are the just about the most 
important spells you will ever get, especially Root. You should already have 
enough experience in the game to know what I mean by that. I can't say much 
about anything beyond this range, I can't see that far.</P>
<P><B>Soloing</B></P>
<P>Soloing is never really easy, and it's not nearly as much 
fun as grouping, but so far as the ability to do it goes a Paladin is pretty 
good. I have probably soloed about 4-5 levels in total (besides 1-5). Paladins 
are good at soloing mainly because after level 9 you can heal yourself during 
combat instead of running when it gets hairy. Really tough monsters will 
interrupt you when casting, but whites and under usually will not (depends). 
With practice, you can become fairly adept at tabbing between yourself and your 
target to heal. Always keep buffs on, and pick a place near a wall or corner. 
This was you have 50%-75% less area to keep a watch for monsters wanting to join 
your fight. Of course, always have a clear exit to run (preferably with guards). 
I suggest you do NOT rely on Lay Hands to beat tough monsters unless the payoff 
is enormous (like if you see a monster carrying a great weapon or something). 
This practice is good once, but since you can't do it consistently, it's not 
worth being screwed later on because you used your Lay Hands. When you solo, you 
need to take single blues one after another as fast as possible with Lay Hands 
as a backup. You should not take one Yellow or Red per hour+half then blues 
after that.</P>
<P>he best thing to do is to run up, hit a single blue, then 
run back to your cubby hole (drawing the monster back) to finish it at levels 
before 15. Rinse and repeat. This is the basic process for most any character. 
At level 15, if you solo undead you can stay in your cubby hole and draw single 
undead to you with Ward Undead. When doing this, conserve mana for 
healing.</P>
<P>Use one Ward Undead to draw then hold off and just melee it. 
If it starts going bad, heal yourself and duke it out. If it goes well and the 
monster flees, hit it with WU again so you don't have to follow and expose 
yourself to more risk. You can also use Lull Undead to take only a single 
monster when there are two, although I rarely found this to be worth 
doing.</P>
<P>At level 22 you get Root to make them stay put. This is very 
important since by then you will be doing more damage faster, and monsters will 
tend to flee earlier and bring back really tough nasties if you let them. Root 
is essential to solo at later levels.</P>
