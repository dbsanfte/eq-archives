<font size="+3">Chapter 5: Befallen</font>
<p>-----</p>

<p>	A skeleton ran at Ravell as he entered the ruins of Befallen.  Ravell had come prepared, however, and already had his sword drawn.  He had heard stories of these ruins before and while he had never been there, he knew of the evil contained within.  The skeleton struck at Ravell with a strange amount of speed for something undead, and Ravell did not move in time to dodge the attack.  He moved backwards with the blow to reduce its damage.  Ravell shook his head, trying to get rid of the pain.  He looked up at the creature just in time to receive another bony fist to his stomach.  Ravell grunted and jumped back, trying to get some room to work with his two-handed sword.  The skeleton kept him hard pressed, and backhanded at Ravell as he moved away.  Missing entirely, the undead creature moved forward.  Ravell put the tip of his sword to the ground and let the creature get within range.  It struck out at Ravell again, but this time found that its attack was useless, as its arm was severed from the body in a blurred arc of steel.  Ravell reversed the strike, bringing his blade back down on top of the skeleton's head.  Bone shattered underneath the sharp edge of the claymore and the skeleton ceased its undead animations.</p>
<p>	Ravell took a moment to look around.  The ruins of Befallen glowed with an eerie light, and pieces of white marble and cement lay scattered about.  In front of him, human heads were impaled upon spikes, making him very wary of this place.  A few skeletons stood in the center of the room, but they didn't seem to notice anything nearby.  The entire place smelt of rotting flesh and decaying bone, which reminded Ravell of the necromancer guild hall in Neriak.</p>
<p>	Ravell took a moment to let the pain subside from his previous fight, and then leapt into action.  There were four skeletons scattered around some fallen ceiling in the center of the room.  Two of them were weaker and would not attack.  The two in back were out of view of the first two, so they would not know a fight was happening if the first two were downed quickly.  Ravell cleaved the first of the weaker skeletons into little bits.  He then brought his sword up to shoulder height and spun around.  He was crouched by the end of the half circle spin, and his sword went straight through the other skeleton's backbone at the midsection.  The top half of the skeleton crashed to the ground and shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>	"Easy enough, now for the hard part." Ravell thought.  He jumped onto the top of the rubble at the center of the room and threw a small dagger at a nearby skeleton.  The other one noticed, and both came climbing up the rubble Ravell was atop.  Ravell was perched on a piece of marble that was diagonal to the floor, and the first skeleton leapt at him from a nearby rock.  Ravell batted the thing aside with his claymore, and it crashed against the ground but stayed intact.  The second skeleton grappled onto Ravell's back and both the drow and skeleton fell from the rock.  Ravell landed on the skeleton, which landed on the floor.  The first skeleton had now recovered and ran up towards the pair on the floor when Ravell somersaulted backwards onto his feet.  The skeleton continued its charge as Ravell smiled evilly at the creature.  His sword was now perpendicular to his body, held at shoulder height.  Ravell's blade dissapeared, replaced by a v-shaped steel blur in front of the drow.  The skeleton collapsed into a pile of cleaved bones and a broken skull as the second skeleton came charging from the floor.  Ravell lost ground while trying to parry and dodge the attacks coming from the creature.  Unwilling to let himself be pressed into a corner, Ravell kept his dance going in circles around the room until he found an opening.  The skeleton overreached on an attack, and Ravell ducked the attack and thrust upward with his blade.  The claymore became lodged in the skull, and Ravell gave it a quick jerk.  The blade was removed, and the skull shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>	"What are you doing here?  Don't tell me you've decided to live out here..." A female voice sounded from Ravell's side.</p>
<p>	Ravell didn't have to turn to know who it was, he had just heard that voice near Nektulos.  "I might ask you the same thing, Lilith." </p>
<p>	"Well apart from watching your sloppy swordplay, I have come here to collect bone chips and return a stolen artifact to the guildhouse in Neriak.  A pity I have all but finished, or I would have you join me."  Lilith explained.  Her rogue friend was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>	"Where's your friend?" Ravell asked.</p>
<p>	Lilith shrugged.  "He's near us somewhere.  He is just around to make sure I don't fall during my duties.  He'll show up when I need him."</p>
<p>	Ravell nodded thoughtfully.  "I am here for an ogre shadowknight who has crossed my enslaver, Miss Nyvare.  If I do not kill him for her she will use this collar to force me into attacking Neriak."</p>
<p>	"That is unfortunate.  I do not know a great deal about magical devices but I have never heard of one able to make someone do something against their will."  Lilith began to pick up some of the shattered bones from Ravell's fight.  "I know where the ogre is, but you'll need keys to get to him."</p>
<p>	A worried but threatening voice sounded from the entrance.  "High elves!  Lilith we must get you to safety, there are high elves about!"</p>
<p>	Lilith grinned evilly.  "Oh goody! I was wondering what I would get to kill next."</p>
<p>	The rogue from before rushed up to the shadowknight.  "Lilith, there is a very experienced paladin headed this way, and you would not be able to defeat him.  We must flee immediately."</p>
<p>	Lilith looked dissapointed.  "Bah! I can handle myself."</p>
<p>	A pair of high elves came walking into the room, one a heavily armored paladin wielding a shining two-handed sword.  The rogue looked ill.  "Too late.  Lilith you must leave, I shall buy you some time."</p>
<p>	Lilith gulped.  "Ravell, you should try to find a place in these ruins to hide."  With that said, Lilith chanted a few words in an arcane tongue and dissapeared.</p>
<p>	Ravell hid immediately behind some rubble and watched as the rogue approached the paladin.  The young high elf with him was obscured from view due to some fallen marble, but Ravell wanted to see this fight.</p>
<p>	"You do not have to fight me, rogue.  I will let you leave here unscathed."  The paladin offered.</p>
<p>	A voice came from beyond Ravell's view.  "Please don't fight, I wish only to speak with you."  </p>
<p>	"You think I'd believe your lies?! I am no fool, elf.  Fight or die." The rogue spat.</p>
<p>	The paladin gripped his sword in a defensive stance.  "Very well, I gave you a chance."</p>
<p>	The rogue did an aerial flip, landing at the back of the paladin.  As he tried to stab the elf in the back, the paladin ducked forward and kicked backwards, sending the rogue flying.  The paladin turned and again took up his defensive stance.  The rogue flipped back onto his feet and threw knives in a group at the paladin.  The knives spread out, there was no way the paladin could dodge them all, or so Ravell thought.  The paladin's blade moved so quickly it was hard even to find a blur of movement, and the sound of metal striking metal echoed throughout the room.  Four knives made small clanging noises as they hit the floor.  The paladin was back in his original stance, and it seemed as if he had never moved at all.  Ravell was now as awestruck as when he first saw the sky.  How could that paladin, a dirty elf, fight so well?  The rogue seemed to be in just as much disbelief, but pulled fresh knives seemingly out of air.</p>
<p>	"You will die by my poisoned knives, paladin.  You can't deflect them all." The rogue threatened.</p>
<p>	The paladin never let up his stance.  "I have already shown that I can and will.  Run before I decide to stop playing, rogue."</p>
<p>	The black-clad rogue's face was stamped with knowledge that the paladin wasn't just boasting.  The look was just as soon replaced with pure hatred, and the rogue lunged at the paladin again.  He moved with a grace that was fitting for a dark elf, and Ravell began to wonder just who would win the fight watching him.  This paladin was experienced in battle, but so was this rogue.  The knives were thrust out again and again in a technique very near flawless.  Both knives would strike out at the same time, and they would retract just long enough to take aim for another vital area.  Yet every attack was deflected by the paladin, who seemed to not even break a sweat.  </p>
<p>	The rogue jumped back, knowing that he had to get in an attack at the paladin's back.  The paladin lowered his sword to the ground and watched the rogue intently.  The rogue ran and did another aerial flip over the paladin's head.  When the rogue was directly overhead in the middle of his flip, the paladin shot into action, spinning around and swinging his blade in a full circle.  The blade tip touched the ground again, and two halves of the now dead rogue crashed at either side of the paladin.  </p>
<p>	Ravell flinched at the sight, he was surely next.  He couldn't possibly hope to defeat such an enemy.  Ravell circled around the rubble he was hiding by and ran through a door.  He didn't care where he was going, he just had to find a place to hide.  The paladin would surely slay him.  He couldn't die an outcast.  He couldn't be remembered only in shame.  He had to live, he had to return to Neriak.</p>
<p>	Ravell saw a large skeleton and a well in the room ahead of him, but he didn't care.  He ran into the room and tried to hide behind the well.  Perhaps the skeleton wouldn't see him.  Ravell crouched behind the well, for the first time knowing gut-wrenching fear.  The skeleton didn't seem to notice, strangely.  Ravell listened intently, but the beating of his heart seemed to drown out all sound.  It was so loud, Ravell thought that the paladin would surely find him by its sound alone.  Trying to calm down, Ravell regulated his breathing.</p>
<p>	"I have to calm down.  They won't find me. They might not have even seen me.  I was hiding during the fight, and there are a million doors in this place.  They won't find me." He told himself in his thoughts.</p>
<p>	Then Ravell heard the loud clanking that could only come from an armored shoe stepping on the concrete floor.  His heart skipped a beat, and he forgot to breathe.  Ravell's mind cried defeat yet he couldn't make a single sound.  Then the sound happened again, and again.  It was getting closer, and finally Ravell gave up.  He stood up and walked towards the noise, determined that if he was to die he would go down fighting.  Ravell neared the corner of the hallway and the clanking stopped.  He turned the corner and stopped dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>	All he saw was blue.  Twin blue orbs looking at him.  Ravell stared into the feminine eyes looking back at him, seeing endless depths within.  Ravell's fear was lost in a round blue ocean, and he stood there transfixed.  This was surely as beautiful as the sky he had gazed at earlier that day.  The twin orbs before him held as more beauty than Ravell could have imagined.  Melodic tones seemed to play in the background like music, but Ravell tried to ignore them.  He was still staring into the deepest blue eyes he had ever seen when he realized that the melodic tones were this elf asking him a question.</p>
<p>	Ravell tried to think of what he had just heard, and give the words meaning.  What was it she had said?  Ahh now he remembered.  "Hello," she had said to him. "What is your name, friend?"</p>
<p>	Ravell stammered his name and managed to bow slightly.  Then the paladin came in.</p>
<p>	"Did you find him?" He asked.</p>
<p>	Ravell's fear came gushing back to him.</p>
<p>	"Yes, brother.  He said his name is Ravell.  He is an odd one." The female answered.</p>
<p>	Ravell couldn't believe his stupidity.  Here he was, a dark elf, thinking a high elf would do him no harm.  He even had the idiocy to bow to her?  Ravell cursed at himself aloud, and then glared at the paladin in front of him.  The paladin looked back, and smiled?!  Ravell drew his sword.</p>
<p>	"If I am to die this day I shall not die a disgrace to the Indigo Brotherhood!  I shall surely fall in battle against you, paladin, but I shall fight you and your kind and be redeemed!" The young drow shouted.</p>
<p>	"Ravell, you idiot!" A female voice sounded.  Suddenly Lilith appeared behind the female high elf and held her dark sword to her neck.  Part of Ravell wanted to cry out in victory, another part wanted to scream in defeat.</p>
<p>	The paladin put his hand on his sword hilt and glared at the shadowknight holding his sister hostage.</p>
<p>	"No you don't! Draw your sword and I'll draw her blood, elf!" Lilith snarled.</p>
<p>	Ravell stood there, trying to decide if he should attack the paladin or not.</p>
<p>	"Very well, but draw her blood and I shall give you the gift of a long, tortured, and painful death." The paladin relaxed his sword arm but did not take his eyes from Lilith.</p>
<p>	Lilith glared right back at him while Ravell watched the scene intently.  He knew Lilith too well, she would kill the elf because she was an elf, regardless of consequence.  Ravell realized he was sad, that he felt he had some connection with this high elf.  Cursing himself again, Ravell closed his eyes.  How could he be so stupid?  High elves were his sworn enemies, especially the two in front of him.  He had to help Lilith by slaying the paladin before she killed the female.  High elves were beneath contempt, Ravell told himself.  They were horrid creatures, jealous of the glory Innoruuk had given his creations. Yes, that was it.  Ravell opened his eyes and knew what he could do.  If he killed this paladin, he would be redeemed in Neriak.  He could go home again.  He would no longer be a slave. He <i>would</i> kill the paladin.</p>
<p>	Ravell walked slowly up and grabbed the paladin's sword.  The paladin didn't move an inch, still watching Lilith and his sister cautiously.  Ravell held the sword back and looked to Lilith.  The paladin still hadn't moved.  Lilith grinned evilly, nodding at Ravell.  Ravell held the sword high above his head, preparing to strike, but still watching Lilith.  This was the right thing to do, he told himself.  No high elves deserved to live, and if he could gain redemption through this act then he would.  It was time to kill the high elves and embrace his hometown again.</p>
<p>	Then Ravell glanced back at the female high elf, who was not afraid.  She just stood there, crying.  But she wasn't crying for herself or her brother.  Ravell knew. She was crying for the drow race.  She was crying because she was unable to find a shred of love or light in these dark elves.  She was crying out of pity.  Ravell's stomach turned, his arms became tired, he swung the sword, and time froze.</p>
<p>	Lilith never even saw it coming.  How could she?  This warrior she had spent so much of her life with she trusted completely.  Ravell's blade curved away from the paladin and cleaved through her blade, lopping it off at the hilt.  It continued through, into Lilith's black metallic shoulderguard and through.  Lilith's hand went numb as Ravell's blade dug deep into her shoulder.</p>
<p>	Lilith looked at Ravell in a mixture of the deepest hurt and disbelief.  Her eyes filled with tears, but Ravell didn't seem to care.  Then it struck her.  Ravell had cut her. He had sided with the high elves.  She didn't know why, but she knew she would hunt him to the ends of Norrath and beyond to get her revenge.  She had trusted him.  She had considered him her friend, her ally.  She had stood up for him when no one else would, and this...<i>this</i> is how he repayed her?  She wouldn't admit it to herself, but she had cared for Ravell, she had even loved him, and this betrayal left the deepest of possible wounds on her.</p>
<p>	Tears left Ravell's eyes as he had to say what he did not want to.  "Lilith...I'm...I'm sorry but you should leave, now."</p>
<p>	Lilith looked into Ravell's eyes and found sincerity.  He had chosen these strangers...these elves! He had chosen them over his own kind, and his best friend.  And he wasn't sorry.  Lilith dropped the useless hilt of her sword and ran away, away from this creature she thought she knew.</p>
<p>	Ravell sighed and handed the sword to the paladin, who had neither moved nor flinched.  Ravell kneeled before the valiant elf and looked up at him through watery eyes.  "Kill me."</p>
<p>	The paladin brought his sword down to touch the ground.  "I shall not kill you, drow.  You may be the only drow I have met worth saving.  I owe you my life, and that of my sister's.  You obviously cannot go home, so you shall travel with us.  My name is Garit, and this is my sister Lenia."</p>
<p>	Ravell gazed up at the now overjoyed Lenia and then looked back to Garit.  "I cannot leave this place, this collar around my neck binds me to a dark necromancer in my homeland."</p>
<p>	Garit lifted his shining blade to the collar and cut through it, not even leaving a scratch on Ravell's neck.  Again the young drow found himself amazed at the skill of this paladin.  The high elf then grabbed the collar and threw it into the well behind Ravell. "Miss Nyvare told me that could not be removed.  I tried my own blade against it....how...?"</p>
<p>	"Simple, young one.  My blade is magical, yours is not.  I assume this Nyvare is the necromancer?  You need not worry about her anymore.  Now let us leave this place, I am becoming sick from the stench of decay and the undead." Garit sheathed his blade.</p>
<p>	Ravell rose, feeling uncertain but hopeful, and left the ruins of Befallen and his dreams of returning to Neriak behind.</p>
