<tr> 
<td width='80%'><P>My father Zakalwe was a good man. The last day I saw him he 
left Freeport for the last time, publicly reviled by a city so dear to him. How 
can someone go from being a Knight of the Hall of Truth, a defender of Marr and 
a Paladin of the purest essence? Perhaps the situation can be best summed up in 
my name, Cheradenine, which in the Ancient Combine tongue means "Darkened 
Truth." It is not the name given to me by my parents, that name is veiled in the 
past. Raised among my fellow squires at the Hall of Truth it is a name given to 
me in curses by my fellow squires, a reminder to my status as the fruit of an 
unholy union of a Paladin of Mithaniel Marr and a Shadow Knight of Innoruuk. So 
like any other story, this shall start in the beginning, but remember that this 
story has been handed down to me by an old friend of my father, one of the few 
to stand by him in his final tortured days. The truth may be far darker than 
anyone thought.</P>
<P>Zakalwe first met my mother while he was journeying to the 
Oasis of Marr in search of the rare Combine Swords sold by the Gypsies there. 
Clad in the purest plate he moved with purpose under the merciless desert sun, 
no doubt slowly roasting himself in his armor. As he crested yet another of the 
seemingly endless dunes of Ro he came upon the scenes of a great battle. One of 
the deadly Sand Giants of the region lay dead in the sun, its body slashed 
repeatedly by what no doubt was a mighty blade. By its side a human female 
warrior lay near death, only the very slow rising of her chest giving evidence 
she was still alive. Rushing to her side Zakalwe quickly saw that even his 
healing spells would not be enough to save her. Drawing upon the power of Marr 
he concentrated his life force into healing her, laying his hands upon her 
battered arm. As he healed her he could feel something... wrong as his life 
force mixed with hers. Sitting back, exhausted, he took stock of the situation. 
It was then that he noticed something amiss. Lying near the injured soul was a 
sword of the darkest steel, encrusted with elder Tier'Dal runes of the darkest 
sort. Meditating upon his spells, Zakalwe waited for her to wake up so that he 
could find the truth in this disturbing matter.</P>
<P>When my mother, Lor'Ensanon awoke, she was appalled at the 
sight of a Paladin standing over her. However rather than lashing out at him as 
she might have, they instead began to talk; of trivial matters at first, later 
things far deeper. In time they reached an understanding, this gradually grew to 
love and a year later I was born in the small hut of Altunic Jartin. With my 
birth however things began to go horribly wrong, the pent up aggression between 
the Paladins, Freeport Militia and followers of Innoruuk stoked into a raging 
inferno by this and subsequent events. As the events of history swept my parents 
apart onto opposite sides I was given to the Hall of Truth to raise among the 
other orphans of this terrible conflict.</P>
<P>What happened to my parents, you ask? I shall first talk 
about my father, for his role, though painful, did not corrupt his soul to the 
extent of my mother. When the Hall of Truth learned the full extent of the 
relations between Zakalwe and Lor'Ensanon my father was stripped of his rank as 
a Knight of Truth. Reduced to a mere squire he however boldly went forth against 
the enemies of Mithaniel Marr in the belief that his virtue would once more be 
accepted. This, however, was not the case. With the increasing levels of warfare 
against the Freeport Militia and the followers of Innoruuk my father was less 
and less accepted among his fellow Paladins. Finally he was given a final chance 
at redemption, one which few believed he would accept and fewer thought he could 
succeed. At age 17 I saw my father leave Freeport clothed in a robe of penance, 
armed only with a rusty short sword and given the task of travelling across the 
breadth of Antonica to the far off city of Qeynos to plead for aid from the 
Storm Guards. He returned to Freeport 3 months later, a battered, bleeding 
corpse whose only sign of life was random breathing. Standing over him, with 
several of his former companions turning away I called upon the forces of 
Mithaniel Marr so that I may use the righteousness of my act to Lay Hands and 
heal him, if even in a meager way. Like many of the other tests I faced as a 
Squire of Truth I failed in this. Holding my father in my arms I heard his final 
words whispered into my ear, "Follow the Truth no matter the cost." After his 
death my father was interned in a common grave in the Commonlands outside 
Freeport, denied burial among his brethren at the Hall of Truth due to his 
tainted status.</P>
<P>My mother's role in the growing conflict earned her the ire 
of both sides. While she remained a champion of Innoruuk she grew to believe 
that his followers on Norrath were not ready and that instead the forces of good 
must triumph for the short term to allow the seed of Innoruuk to grow among the 
Knights of Truth. To achieve this she undertook one final quest roughly at the 
same time as my father. While he traveled across a continent she went south, 
into the swamps of Innothule to the far off site of Guk. In Guk she hoped to 
gain control of Ghoulbane and turn it over the Zakalwe so he might lead the 
Knights of Truth to victory over Innoruuk in this cycle of History. With his 
victory Innoruuk would be able to corrupt the Knights of Truth and finally bring 
about the end of the reign of the Lightbringer. She was never seen again after 
she passed beyond the Oasis of Marr by the eyes of man. Her fate remains 
unknown.</P>
<P>And what of my upbringing, you ask? As you can guess it is 
not a subject which I wish to remember for the memories remain sharp and the 
hatred my fellow squires felt towards me all to plain. For what is the point of 
regaling at my success in swordcraft if I must also remember the severe beating 
afterwards by both my guildmaster and my fellow squires by showing greater 
aptitude then they? I do not know the name my parents gave me, only the one 
given to me by Taskmaster Rallon. Though a former friend and ally of my father 
he reviled the blood that flowed within me and seemingly attempted to draw out 
all of the darker elements from it. Considering the time I spent in the 
infirmary following many of his "lessons" it is of great wonder that I live to 
tell this tale. Many obstacles were placed in my path to Knighthood, and it is 
with a heavy heart that I must say that I stumbled over them.</P>
<P>At my 8th rank I was given the chance to take the Test of 
Truth and pass into full knighthood as a defender of Marr. Those who gave me the 
quest no doubt hoped I would fail at my task, and that I did. However it was not 
in the field of battle that I failed, but rather that of compassion. At the end 
of the Test of Truth I was given the task of slaying a Guard. However upon a 
short discourse with the Guard I did not believe her guilty of many of the 
crimes of the Militia, and so I spared her life as a true follower of the Truth 
would. Returning to the Guildmaster with these news I awaited the granting of my 
status as a Knight of the Truth. In its stead I was banished from the Halls of 
Truth for ever more, labeled a fallen squire who did not follow the true path of 
Mithaniel Marr. An outcast among both the Paladins and commoners of Freeport I 
fled across the continent to Qeynos, following the footsteps of my father little 
more than 4 years ago. In Qeynos I have been widely accepted yet there remains a 
gnawing hole in my heart at my outcast nature among my own kind.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is my very acceptance of the title they gave me 
that has earned their ire. Studying for some time in the Library of Erud I was 
able to decipher some of the most ancient of Innoruuk's teachings. Among them 
tells of a Champion of the Light who shall bring Innoruuk to his knees and unite 
the scattered races of Marr. The name of that champion translated from ancient 
Teir'Dal is Darkened Truth. Whether I can live up to this immense task is highly 
in doubt, I can only live up to the hopes of my parents. As a Squire of the 
Truth I shall uphold the beliefs of Mithaniel Marr in the hope that at one final 
day I may be accepted by the Lightbringer</P>
