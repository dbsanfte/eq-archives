  <tr><td ><p>A voice is heard, however no words can be made out, for the voice seems
to be too far away. "...Sirynn! Wake up... Damnit, Sugan (*true Leader of the Wind Riders*) has no need for
a dead bard, wake up already!" It is a voice Sirynn knows all too well. A
moan escapes from Sirynn's mouth as he opens his eys. "...uggghhh
Faileas(*Leader of the Shadow Striders*)? What are you doing in my head...?"  Sirynn SPeaks outloud as if
Faileas were close enough to hear him, although he can tell by the
slight throb in his head that Faileas is probally nowhere near him, and
using his mental skill to talk to him and read his thoughts. Sirynn
looks aruond at his cavernous surroundings, "Last thing I remember is
resting up after being chased out of Soulsek's Eye... Where in Norrath
am I now?!"</p>

<p>"Sirynn, you are in Nektulos. Envy has you held up in Nuryn's Labratory.
It is crucial that you get out of there soon, as I am sure the necro is
not far and will know of your release from their spell when he sees
you." At that Sirynn felt the throbbing in his head stop, and he could
tell Faileas was through helping him out, and he was on his own now.</p>

<p>Whispered to himself, as if he was thinnking outloud. "Arghhh... OK I'm
in Nektulos for the first time ever, and Faileas just told me I am being
held by Envy and some Necro named Nuryn (whoever that is, I guess its
just another strider).  Hmmm... Not good, I somehow need to find my way
out of a foreign, and VERY hostile city (heh at least to this
"lighhtwalker"), all at the same time avoiding Envy and her little
henchmen..."  Just as Sirynn finishes his thought, he hears a whistling
sound echoing through the caverns.  Quickly without thought he pulls his
flute out of his pack, and begins humming a tune he has had memorized
since he was taught it on his 19th season, Shauri's Sonorous Clouding. 
With the flute in hand and the humming of the words inbetween notes, he
is covered in a cloud of music, completely vanishing to all, but those
with the magic to see through his cloud.</p>

<p>Nuryn strolls around the caverns, whistling his favorite Teir'dal tune,
heading for his labratory.  He thinks he hears the soft whistle of a
flute over his whistling. Nuryn stops whistling and chuckles to himself
for a moment.  "Heh, Nuryn your hearing things.  Stop beign so paranoid,
this is your city, no one would dare enter this far just to play some
instrument"  Not knowing much of Bardic ways Nuryn thinks nothing of the
flute playing which he thought he heard and is taken aback when he
reaches his labratory, and sees that his "prisoner", who has been
incapacitated for quite some time, is no longer there.  "O... OK
Sirynn... where'd you go??" Nuryn said with a shiver to his body, and
more importantly his hands.</p>

<p>Sirynn, still humming and whistling Shauri's, turns to see Nuryn and
quickly cirlces arond behind him. Nuryn not knowing his "prisoner" is
clouded from view by the song, has no magic up to aid his sight. So
Sirynn stays unseen until he stops playing Shauris, and pulls his Lute
out and begins Strumming Kellin's Lucid Lullaby.  At hearing this Nuryn
spins around and takes a step back, as he does this he stats chanting
something, and his hands begin glowing, but a weird sound is heard over
the song and Nuryn curses.  As the lullaby begins getting through to
Nuryn, and his eyes begin to shut slowly.  He lets out a shout, a
warning to his Lady Envy of their prisoners awakening.</p>

<p>As soon as he realizes Nuryn is asleep he switches to his drum and
begins strumming Selo's Accelerendo.  "Damnit! Now, ontop of all my
other problems, I have to run from this baby necro and Envy herself. In
a city where they have all the advantages!"  Sirynn runs aimlessly
though the hidden caverns of neriak.  Suddenly he comes apon a door, it
is quite larger then most doors he has seen... actually its about the
size of the doors he's seen in Halas.  Not knowing what lies behind this
enormous door, he swiotches back to his flute and Shauri's, then reaches
with his free hand to open the door.  he has to push with all his might
to move the door which proves to weigh as heavy as it looks, to Sirynn's
dismay.  He doesn't bother shutting the door because infront of him
stands a Giagantic, and rather robust and ugly Troll in Steel Armor. 
Sirynn almost misses a note with his Sonorous CLouding, which would mean
his cloud would disperse for a moment, which in turn would mean
unevitable deathn by this gigantic Troll in front of him.</p>

<p>Luckily for him though he retained his composure and begins to exit the
building through another of those gigantic heavy doors.  When behind him
he hears Nuryn say "AH HA! There you are."  Either Envy enlightened the
young DE Necro upon the fact that bards have an invis song, or he
figured it out on his own to use some of his magic to see thorugh
Sirynn's clouding.  Whichever it was, Sirynn wasn't sticking around to
chat. He took off runing from building to building, rooftop to rooftop,
trying to find an exit. Suddenly he sees Envy, patrolling a street below
a rooftop hes on.</p>

<p>Breathing heavily, Sirynn ducks in a corner on some roof.  "Damn, this
ain't fair, now I wish I had come to this city at least once, so I could
see the entrance from the inside..."  Out of nowhwere as if Envy knew
what he was thinking she shouts, "Sirynn, deary, you are not getting out
of here. My slave and I are searching for you, and we WILL find you!" 
With that Sirynn regained his composure and noticed a wall he could jump
off.  As he did he saw another cavern, as he neared it he could smell
the familiar smell of the dark Nektulos Forest.  With this he began to
rejoice, and spun around to see what he guessed was the main gate of
Neriak because fo the steel plated Teir'dal guards.  He also noticed the
wench Envy standing there, trying to be slick and stop him from exiting
the city.  He stopped singing Shauri's long enough to shout "HA Envy,
you had me in YOUR city, had one of your henchmen helpign you lok for
me, and you still could not stop me from leaving!  Catchya later
wench!"  At that he began running through the tunell which lead outside
the underground city of Neriak and to the evil Nektulos Forest.</p>

<p>However waiting for him at the ecit of the tunell was the little necro
Nuryn. "Ha, it seem sI have you know Sirynn you won't be getting past
me"  Right as he finished his sentence, Sirynn just used what might he
had to overpower the necro, and just threw him aside.  And he couldn't
help but let out a chuckle as he heard the necro say, "Ya Big bully." 
Now running in more familiar territory he felt a sense of bewilderment
as to what happened to him and his fellow riders while he was under
Envy's spell, and how in the world she was able to get through to him
with her magic, when she had tried time and time before with no avail. 
As he reached the  part where Nektulos Forest merged with the East
Commonlands Sirynn noticed a face he hoped not to see.</p>

<p>"Envy, you tricky little wench, what arev you up to here?" Sirynn asked
all the while keeping his Selo's up incase he needed to beat a hasty
retreat if reinforcements showed up for Envy.  "Well to put it simply
Sirynn, dear, I'm after you." Sirynn was puzzled, but Envy walked
forward so close to Sirynn you couldn't fit an aviaks feather inbetween
them, and she looked up slightly right nito his eyes.  Any other time
Sirynn would have laughed at the Teir'dal for trying to woo him with her
"charms" but this time there was somehting differetn, and all he could
do was stare into her eyes.</p>

<p>Wheezing heavily, Nuryn runs up alongside Envy. "Huhhh...Sirynn you
bully..." Catching his breath. "Mistress Envy... I am here... Sorry for
my delay"  Nuryn knels before his mistress.  Sirynn, not even
acknowledging Nuryn's apearance, continues to stare into Envy's eyes. 
"Hmmmm... You did well Nuryn, you will be punished later."  Nuryn
smiles, but then her words set in. "Pu, Punished?!"  pondering the
situation Envy reaches into her bag and pulls out what looks like a
hooded doll.  She pulls back the hood and reveals it to be a wooden
replica of Sirynn.  Upon seeign this Sirynn stops looking into Envy's
eyes. Instead it's as if he's Staring through her.  Sirynn speaks with a
somewhat robotic tone to him.  "Lady Envy what is it you wish of me?"
Envy cackles with glee.</p>

<p>"Sirynn, my love, you are to be my mate... a Teir'dal mate.  And you and
I together will wreak havok admist these wood.  And hopefully we can
find one of your fellow Wind Riders to harass, hahah." Sirynn, now
having a somewhat deeper tone to his voice echoes Envy's laugh. "Hahah
sounds terrific, my love."</p>

<p>"Mi, Mistress?" Envy, turns towards nuryn with the ferocity she normaly
only shows during battle, and Sirynn stands beside "his love".
"...Nuryn, I forgot you were here." Envy pauses a moment, puts a finger
to her chin in thought, then a malicious grin appeares on her face.  "Ah
yes, as I promised Nuryn, your punishment..."  "Bu, but mistress
envy..." Envy slaps Nuryn across the face with the back of her hand. 
"Are you disobeying me Nuryn?" "N, no mistress" Nuryn says wiping the
blood from the corner of his mouth.  "Well then, I beleive I will allow
my love to do the honors Nuryn. Hows that sound to you dear?"  Already
sitting down looking through his songbook for a song that can work as
punishment, he only nods in response to Envy.</p>

<p>"Hmmm, psalm of healing... Naaa too, nice ewwww." Sirynn flips the page
and runs his finger along the page. "Hmmm Denon's Disruptive Discord...
A painful song, but this freak may enjoy the direct pain so no fun for
us eh?" He glances at Envy who smiles in delight at her work.  Sirynn
flips the page again and runs his finger along, and suddenly he stops. 
Looks up at Nuryn with a mischeivous grin on his face.  He looks over
the words of the song and memorizes them, because he hasn't sung this
one in a while.  Sirynn stands up, and pulls his brass horn out of his
bag.  "Now this shoud be fun."  Sirynn begins humming the words of a
song, envy doesnt recognize, then he puts the brass horn to his mouth
and begins playing it.  As Sirynn begins to creep closer to Nuryn, Nuryn
negins to shake a bit.  "P, please Sir Sirynn go easy on me..."  With
that Nuryn's look on his face goes from scared, to down right afraid.
His eyes widen to the size of an ogres, his lower lip begins to quiver
like a little Feir'dal who's about to be eaten by a Troll, and out of
nowhere he turns and runs. All the while screaming like a little girl. 
Sirynn chuckles to himself, as Envy gigles at Sirynn, all the while
enjoying the show thuroughly.  Nuryn finally regains, his composure and
he runs back to envy, immediately dropping to a knee infront of her. 
Sirynn lets out a menacing laugh, and puts the horn to his mouth again.
And the same effect happens, Nuryns eyes widen, his lip quivers, he
turnns and starts screaming again.  Sirynn can't help but chuckle again.
"Ahhh Angstlich's Appaling Screech, scares the hell out of anything
that's close enough to hear it." Envy laughs as Nuryn returns again. 
"Good boy, just like a loyal pet, you return.  That wil be all for your
punishment today Nuryn, return to your labratory."  Nuryn bows. "Yes
mistress"</p>

<p>Sirynn walks up to Nurn again, a devilish look in his eyes.  Nuryn looks
at him, a look of desperation in his eyes.  Kinda like a lost puppy that
had been lost and finally found its way back, only to see in front of
him a river that could get him right back to where he started. Envy
starts walking towards the Commons not noticing whats going on behind
her asks Sirynn, "Shall we leave this desolate forest dear?"  Sirynn,
not hearing her only says "Na".  Nuryn, knowing Sirynn's speaking to
him, turns and begins his run back to his labratory.  Envy looks at her
doll she's stil holding, then towards Sirynn. "What was that dear?"
Sirynn turning and just now noticing Envy's speaking to him replys, "Oh
sorry my love was speaking to Nuryn, what was it you wanted?"  Envy 
sighing with releife, "Oh nothing, just lets get out of this desolate
plac,e and look for soem more people to terorize." Sirynn smiles "Hahah
sure thing my love."</p>

<p>Elsewhere. Latharos, upon slaying another Teir'dal in Mistmoore feels a
disturbance about him.  "I wonder what that was?  I tire of fighting
these beings, I think I'll look for a friendly druid to port me back to
the mainlands and see what is going on with my fellow riders... I just
got a bad feeling about something."</p>

<p>Envy and Sirynn run around the commonlands terrorizing the local
newbies, who are just beginging their adventures, simply because they
can.  Ater a couple hours of that fun, they decide to rest for a bit ni
the tunell on the eastern side fo the commons, the one that leads to the
Northern Desert of Ro.  As they sit their laughing and cackling about
the misfortune of those they happened to run across, Latharos walks up
to the duo.  Latharos looks at Sirynn with a bewildered look, and then
turns to envy and scowls.  Sirynn look sup and greets him. "Ahhh it
seems we have been lucky enough for a wind rider to grace us with their
presence my love."  Sirynn smiles at envy, who returns his smile with
one of her own.  Envy licks her lips "Yes it seems that way, and,
oooooo, its a nice Teir'dal Paladin too."  Latharos looks at Sirynn,
wondering whats going on with him. "Sirynn, what has this witch done to
you?" Sirynn's attention snapped to Latharos, "My love, Envy, has done
nothing to me, is there something wrong with two Tier'dals being
together and causing mayhem?"  Envy laughed, but suddenly she began to
sway, as if she was about to fall. So she sat down, she must have
overexerted herself in her amusement and the newly found poison was able
to wither down her stamina and energy.  "Sirynn, dear, I must return to
my quarters."  Sirynn turned his back on Latharos as he was trying to
say something to him, "Of course my love."  He bent over and went to
pick her up.  Either Envy's armor made her too heavey, or Sirynn was
just plain weak and he struggled in picking her up.  While trying to
carry Envy Sirynn stumbled and dropped her, at the same time the doll
fell out of her hand and slid across the tunell floor.</p>  

<p>Latharos just now noticing this wooden doll, which, coincidentaly to
Latharos, happened to look alot like Sirynn.  "It's the Doll!" Latharos
exclaimed as he darted for the doll, a second before envy moved for it. 
Latharos was able to reach the doll first and broke it into many peices,
then threw the peices onto the ground.  Envy screeched as Latharos broke
her doll, but in her condition all she could do was grab the head, which
he was unable to break with his hands, and scurry off to her mansion in
Neriak.</p>

<p>Sirynn shook his head and groaned, "Oh man... whats going on? Last I
knew I was running from Envy and her slave Nuryn..." Latharos put his
hand on Sirynn's shoulder, "My friend Envy had you under a spell, you
and her seeemd to be a couple for a time there you even thought you wrre
a Teir'dal."  Sirynn's jaw dropped, "How did she manage that?" Latharos
bends down and picks up the wood shavings off the ground, "Either she,
or someone else, crafted a wooden replica of yourself" Latharos handed
the shavings to Sirynn, who looked at them closely... "S, I, R, E, N...
Siren, so this is why cratress wanted my mothers lute..."  Latharos
looked at Sirynn with a confused look.</p>

<p>Sirynn chuckled, "To put it plainly, a while ago a Teir'dal Wizard,
named Cratress, who was a strider attacked me, and got a lute off me my
mother had given to me... I couldn't figure out why she would want that
for the life of me... until now." Sirynn sighed and put the peices into
his bacpack.  Latharos comforted Siryn "It's OK friend, the Striders are
a confusing bunch, one can never truly know what they are up to." Sirynn
noded, "Well thank you for bringing me back to my sense, friend."  At
that time Envy shouted something to Latharos about somehting she knew,
but he wasn't going to know since he intervened with her plans. 
Whatever she is speaking of friend, I'm sure we can fidn out somehow, a
lot of us have quite a few conections, and besides there are ways to
make her talk." Sirynn said trying to comfort Latharos who suddenyl had
a defeated look on his face.  "I have top go afetr her, hopefully I can
catch her." Sirynn frowned, but nodded, "I understand Lath, May the four
winds guide you swiftly and safely my friend." Sirynn and Latharos shook
hands, and at that Latharos was off after Envy, and Sirynn was off to
freeport to see what he could do about those wooden peices...</p></td></tr>
