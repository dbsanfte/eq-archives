Chapter 5 Call of the Familiar<br>
------------------- <necromancer apprentice barracks. </p></p>

<p>Commotion whipped through Paineel. It spread like wildfire,
eventually winding up in the necromancer apprentice barracks.</p>

<p>&quot;What's with all the noise!! Can&#146;t a girl get some
sleep around here!?!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Meya! You have to see this. Its! Its&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What! What!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Just come see!&quot; </p>

<p>Meya threw on her robe and dashed after her friend.
Approaching the city center, they stopped. On starred in awe of
what lay on the ground. Leading from the mirror gate towards the
Council Chamber, was burn marks inside large splashes of blood. </p>

<p>&quot;By Cazic! What could have made these marks?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t know but lets go on over to the
crowd.&quot; </p>

<p>They followed the trail and did their best to get inside the
circle of people outside the Council Chambers. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey what happened!&quot; Meya shouted into the crowd. </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel has completed the first Test of Passing.&quot;
came a voice, just inside the Chamber doors. &quot;He has finally
tapped the first power of a Hell Knight&quot; said the figure
moving into view. It was Asyhur. </p>

<p>The crowd quieted down. It was an eerie silence. The crowd
knew what this entailed, one of their own was now of those who
are only whispered in shadows. One that even, the make the
soulless undead quake. </p>

<p>-------------<br>
Raziel's body radiated with energy. So much energy that the
ground he stepped on was charred. In his hands, the heads of 6
paladins, bled. He made his way up the winding steps leading to
the Council. The Skeleton guards snapped to attention at his
approaching footsteps, ready to attack, but they shied away when
he came into view. Energy crackled around him and the doors to
the Council flew open. He entered and casually threw the heads at
the feet of the Council. </p>

<p>&quot;Ah Raziel. You have done well. You have exceeded our
wildest expectations. You have unlocked your true calling and
have completed the First Test of Passing.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel laughed. </p>

<p>&quot;You find this funny?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;First? Last. It is of no concern to me. I have tasted
the soul of the fallen and I want more! Every fiber of my being
is exploding with power!&quot; </p>

<p>As if his strength needed proof, the skeleton guards inside
the chambers, detonated,spraying bone dust across the room. </p>

<p>&quot;You will have more, you can fill your need to your
hearts content. If you complete the last Test of Passing. If you
can become a Hell Knight.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Then what will you have me do?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Not yet Raziel. In tomorrow&#146;s moonlight, you will
take the final test. As for now, go to your quarters and learn to
control your new found powers&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel begrudgingly complied and exited the chambers. His
power still radiating brightly </p>

<p>&quot;At least he still follow his orders. You were right
Malik, his strength is terrifying. I haven&#146;t felt power
radiate from someone like that, since you went through the Test
of Passing&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I am certain he shall acquire a strong familiar in
tomorrows test, lets hope he can acquire some control as
well.&quot; </p>

<p>------------------------- </p>

<p>The day went by slowly. But finally night fell and the moons
rose high in the sky. </p>

<p>&quot;Meya!! hurry up we have to get ready!..Meya?...Meya
what&#146;s wrong?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m...scared... for him&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Who knows what he will see..what he will
encounter.....What if he doesn&#146;t come back?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Meya. You know Raziel is strong. He will make it. You
heard Lord Ashyur talking today. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I know..but still..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ahhh... so big tough Meya has a crush?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I do not!....well....maybe&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I knew it. That is just even more reason to believe that
he will make it. </p>

<p>&quot;Your right&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now lets go before we are late. I want to get a good
view! Just because you have seen it before, doesnt mean you
should ruin it for me.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Is that all you think about? No wonder you're so far
behind&quot; </p>

<p>---------------------------------------------- </p>

<p>* </p>

<p>Columns of the citizens of Paineel poured out from underneath
the rock. They began to fill the training area. All were sing a
dark chant. It reverberated through the area. It filled the air
with energy. The crowd began to separate as three figures
appeared. Two were in deep black shrouds; the other wore light
Blue everyday clothing. They reached the center and the chanting
grew louder. </p>

<p>The shrouded figures removed their hoods. The figures were
Malik and Ashyur. </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel. You have succeeded in learning all that I could
teach you. You have finally tapped one of our defining abilities.
Now it is time for you to tap the other.&quot; spoke Malik </p>

<p>&quot;To complete your training, you must walk the
Hellfire&#146;s of our Lord's realm. The Dark Plane of Fear. What
you will find, no one can say. What will happen, no one can know.
Do you accept this test?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I do.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Then so mote it be.&quot; </p>

<p>Two other figures stepped up from the crowd. They moved up to
Raziel and ripped his robes off. </p>

<p>Ashyur glowed briefly as mana flowed through him. He held out
a small stone. He began to chant with the crowd. The stone glowed
brighter and brighter until it shattered. Then a crimson gate
stood in the training grounds. Inside the gate flames swirled and
crackled. Raziel stepped up to the gate and passed through. </p>

<p>The crowd fell silent. * </p>

<p>------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p>There was nothing. Everything was blank after he stepped
through the gate. Then pain.. white hot pain. The flames licked
at his naked skin. Ignoring the pain, Raziel waded through the
flames, heading towards a dark tunnel. </p>

<p>/I bet it hurts a lot don&#146;t it?/ </p>

<p>And what of it? </p>

<p>/I bet you are cursing your feeble mortality/ </p>

<p>I think nothing of my mortality. I exceed it. </p>

<p>/HAH. Sure you mortals try to raise your stamina, push your
bodies to new levels. But you can only so go so far. Your bodies
are weak, pathetic. Can't you smell your flesh burning and
crisping? Isn&#146;t it wonderful?/ </p>

<p>You talk too much. Flesh can be destroyed but it can be easily
repaired. Unlike you. Once you are destroyed, you stay destroyed.
I can return. </p>

<p>/A small price for omnipotence and eternal life. Something you
can never attain/ </p>

<p>And you can never be leave this plane as long as you are
'omnipotent', you are a fool. </p>

<p>/....../ </p>

<p>So let us join, and we can attain what we both seek. </p>

<p>/I will never join the likes of a mortal. / </p>

<p>The flames died out. And a form appeared in the distance. It
was made of pure energy. It circled around and then charged
toward Raziel. </p>

<p>/Prepare to embrace your Mortality!/ </p>

<p>It was only a breath away. </p>

<p>&quot;Seronadon!&quot; </p>

<p>The form shrieked in pain </p>

<p>/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!HOW can it be! What mortal can
speak a simple word to cause me so much pain! Can you be?/ </p>

<p>The form charged again and struck Raziel. It was Raziel's turn
for pain, every part of him burned. He felt his body dissolving
away bit by bit. Everything went black. </p>

<p>&quot;Rise Raziel and kneel before me&quot; said a voice </p>

<p>&quot; I ...kneel before..... no man&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Kneel before your Lord!&quot; boomed the voice </p>

<p>Raziel looked up. It was he. Cazic-Thule. The God of Fear
towered over Raziel. </p>

<p>&quot;I kneel before no one! Not even you!&quot; </p>

<p><br>
The god laughed &quot;Defiance, strength. You shall serve me
well. Your power will spread my name, put fear into the hearts of
men as only the shadows know. You have been bonded with one of my
denizens. You are no longer the mortal you once were&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I am destroyed..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You are reborn! You are neither god nor mortal. You are
fear incarnate. Do you know what you are?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I am a Knight of Hell&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; Yes. Now go forth my, Dark Reaver, my Angel of
Death&quot; </p>

<p>-------------------------------------- </p>

<p>The skies above Odus went dark. And great bolts of lightning
spilled from the heavens. One bolt crashed into the center of the
Paineel training grounds. And a great fire leapt about. And in
the center of the flames, stood a figure. A figure clad in
jet-black armor, wielding a blade that shimmered with power. And
on the figure's shoulder stood a Raven. The raven cawed. The
populace that occupied the grounds kneeled before the figure. </p>

<p>----------------------- </p>

<p>End Chapter 5 </p>

<p>---------------------- </p>

<p>-----------------------<br>
Chapter 6 Paradise Lost<br>
----------------------- </p>

<p>It has been 5 months since I defeated my mentor Malik and
became the Hell Lord of Paineel. So much has happened..So much, I
wish I could have changed. </p>

<p>During the months that past, I had begun to select my
apprentices, the ones that would succeed me, the ones that would
guard my people. One in particular is highly skilled, Maxim. He
is strong, ambitious, in some ways he is like me. heh. Maybe I
will be retiring sooner then I thought. </p>

<p>In that time Arorua was pregnant, in fact she gave birth 2
weeks ago. A beautiful little girl, she is so beautiful.. She
looks so much like Arorua with my darker complexion. We had
decided to call her Leylia, after my mother. But it was at her
naming ceremony that my life... our life was destroyed forever. </p>

<p>-------------------------- </p>

<p>Inside the Great Hall, a small group is assembled. Standing at
an altar, a Council Member Priest cradles a small child. </p>

<p>&quot; She is a beautiful child, you are very lucky
Raziel.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; She owes her beauty to her mother, but her spirit, her
inner fire comes from me&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You never change Raziel. You have always had a way with
word and every girl you come across&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What can I say? I'm blessed.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hehe....O Raziel, whatever happened to us?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; I had to leave for Fawdyer and my lovely Meya had to
leave for Kunark. I guess we were never meant to be
together.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah-huh. You would say anything to get out of
relationship.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;...thats mean....&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hehe. Uh -o. I think we are starting to annoy
everyone.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Bah! Let em wait&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel...&quot; Arorua cut in </p>

<p>&quot;Ok&quot; </p>

<p>Meya waved her hand across the Altar and it opened up,
revealing a small pool of distilled blood rain. </p>

<p>&quot;This child is to enter our community. Does any one
object?&quot; </p>

<p>Silence. </p>

<p>&quot;Then little one you are welcome with open arms into our
people.&quot; She reached in the altar and dipped her finger in
the rain. Taking her finger she ran her finger across the<br>
baby's forehead and around her eyes coming to a tip just at her
mouth, letting her drink just a drop of the rain. The outline
flashed. </p>

<p>&quot;I give on to thee little one the name of Leyli..&quot; </p>

<p>At that moment, all of Paineel shook. And a loud boom
reverberated through. </p>

<p>&quot;What the!&quot; </p>

<p>Passing the child to Arorua, Meya then formed a small viewing
sphere. &quot;By Cazic...&quot; </p>

<p>They had attacked. After all these years, the Puritans of
Erudin had attacked us. They had bypassed the training grounds
and had magically blasted into the entrance of the city. They
were pouring through, killing anyone in their path, men, women
and children with no discretion. </p>

<p>&quot;Arorua, take Leylia to the Vault with the Elders and
stay there!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel but.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Do it!&quot; </p>

<p>I left the hall through the shadows and headed for the front
line.<br>
-------------------------------------- </p>

<p>The battle raged in the city streets. Hundreds of the Dead
poured out of every corner of Paineel to destroy the invaders.
They battled with sword and shield and great feats of magic. The
ground was scorched with magic and the blood of the fallen coated
it. </p>

<p>The Puritans moved quickly using their element of suprise to
the maximum. In little over few minutes, they had gone from
Toxxulia to just outside the Council Chambers. Finally the
supprise of the attack had worn off, and at last they were began
to hold back the Puritans onslaught. </p>

<p>At the heart of the battle, Raziel's apprentices were fighting
with unnatural ferocity. The small group of three was holding
their own against whole divisions of Puritan Paladins and
Templar. However, even their strength was beginning to fail,
especially now that the Holy Grail Knights of Erudin had joined
the fray. </p>

<p>&quot;Maxim look out!&quot; </p>

<p>A blade flew over his head. And his axe whirled into his
assailants mid section. &quot;Thanks Reva!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Die you abominations!&quot; A bolt leapt out from the
fray. It struck the young apprentice girl,<br>
ad she was sent crashing into the Council Chamber walls. She did
not move to get up. </p>

<p>&quot;Reva!&quot; Maxim turned to face the attacker; his heart
sank, when he saw a Grail Knight in front of him. The Knight
towered over him, and for the first time, he was terrified. He
wanted to give up; he wanted to run away. No..Those were the
thoughts of cowards, he had to protect his people, he had to
protect Reva. He braced himself for an attack, but there was no
need. He heard a bird loudly cawing in the distance, his spirits
rose. </p>

<p>He looked up at a raven flying towards the battle, and to his
suprise the Grail Knight backed up. But it was to late, the raven
flew though the thick of the Puritan lines and right through the
Knight. The Knight held still for a second. Then he fell apart;
his insides came out and spilled across the ground. Screams arose
through the battle lines and the same happened to hundreds of
other Puritans. Maxim faced the raven, it glowed brightly for a
second and a figure in Black Armor took its place. </p>

<p>&quot;Thank Cazic, your here M'lord Raziel&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Stop wasting time on gratuities and attend to Reva. I
will deal with these dogs&quot; </p>

<p>He brought his sword in front of him, it began to glow, he
raised it to his head, and then violently crashed to the ground
&quot;Ianuki!&quot; A bolt of energy ripped through the ground
towards the Puritan lines. It slammed into them and detonated. </p>

<p>My god.. what power. He has slain hundreds with single
techniques. How can any one attain so much power? </p>

<p>The battle quickly turned against the Puritans, and they began
to sound retreats. </p>

<p>&quot;You will not escape me, dogs.&quot; Mana began to flow
through Raziel's body. &quot;Feel the power of Death
itself......RAAAAAGGGIIIIINGGGG...&quot; </p>

<p>/RAZIEL!!!/ a scream echoed through his head. /HELP US !! THE
VAULT!!!!/ </p>

<p>He faded into the shadows.<br>
----------------------------------- </p>

<p>&quot;Where is the sullied follower of light! The wench who
seeks the Twilight!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The Twilight!! That is a myth! You are a fool&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Silence wench!&quot; The winged figure threw Meya to the
ground and placed a foot upon her back and pressed down hard. She
screamed in pain. Her screaming only caused the figure to press
down harder &quot;Were is she who seeks the Twilight! Were is the
sullied follower of light!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! May your soul be twisted and lost
in nothingness!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wench!!!&quot; the figure stepped on her again, bones
began to crack. She screamed again &quot;Tell<br>
me!!!&quot; </p>

<p><br>
&quot;Stop!!! I am the one you seek, I am the fallen soul of
Tunare.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ar...o ..a....dont...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Spare her life! I will go with you. Just don&#146;t hurt
Meya anymore&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Alright. I have only come to claim your soul. Your
actions have caused much unrest in the Planes. But you need not
concern yourself with that now&quot; </p>

<p>The figure's sword flashed out and ran through Arorua. A
Shadow whipped through the Vault and the Winged figure cried out
in pain as a blade cut through the wings. Arorua slipped of the
sword and crashed to the ground. </p>

<p>The figure turned around and faced the assailant. &quot;Ahh
you are strong, no mere mortal can injure me.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel stood before the winged figure, analyzing the figure.
&quot;Why do you help the Puritans, you are not Erudite and the
symbol upon your breastplate is not of Elrossi&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It is no concern of yours, my job is done. And if I were
you I would concern myself with other matters&quot; The figure
turned into energy and left the vault. </p>

<p>* &quot;Other matters?&quot; Then he saw Arorua.
&quot;no....&quot; he dropped his sword and his armor faded<br>
away. He got down on the floor and picked her up &quot;Ar!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ra....el....&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Im.sorry..i.was so slow......i failed you&quot; </p>
