  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>Here is an explanation of our class. I am submitting this info because of people thinking Paladins suck compared to Rangers, Warriors, and Bards. Well, I'm here to say I have walked all over them in duels, and only the Bard has come close to beating me (but beat him like a wet towel once I used LayHands).<P>
Now, I think ppl are saying us Paladins are no good because some of you don't know how to duel. I've been dueling alot, and I've only lost ONE duel (not counting all you level 50's I've beenfighting :P). That was to a necromancer, but I've found out a way to even beat them. 
<P>
For casters, you want to use a one handed sword (except necromancers, use a 2HS). Wizards are probably the easiest, seeing as how all you have to do is root them, and use your bash attack and stun spells to interrupt casting (yes, you'll get hit by some of the Shock spells) but you'll take the Wizzie down quickly. Make sure to bash first, and if you miss with bash, DONT cast stun. Save your stun spell for when he casts when your bash isn't available yet.<P>
Also, if you can outfit yourself with gear that is resistant to cold and fire, it's VERY useful.        <P>                                          For fighting Enchanters, beware thier charm. Try not to fight around guards, as a charmed guard can quickly be your end, but if this does happen, root the charmed pet. When root wears off, the 'pet' will come attack the Enchanter, not you. The Enchanter will have to spend most of his mana to keep charm up and aggro down if he doesn't want too pissed off tanks after his butt =) . Now, you will want to go with gear that is high magic resistance. Being slowed is not fun, as the Enchanter will probably try to debuff you like crazy, so when the duel starts, stun (if you can get it off first) then root his pet (if he has one summoned) and charge him. You should win if you play your cards right. But remember, the Enchanter has fairly weak offensive spells compareded to the other casters, it's his status effect spells that suck.<P>
     For Magicians, simple. It's all based on which pet they are using. And MEM YOUR CANCEL MAGIC SPELL. You will want alot of gear that is protective vs fire, and some good weapons, probably a heavier 2hs sword. Interrupting his spells aren't as important as getting hte wizards, so here's the deal. If he has an air pet, root it, and go after the mage. Same deal with a water pet. If it's an earth pet, when you are rooted, fight the pet until you are free, and once you are free ignore the pet and go after the mage. If its a fire pet, don't attack it. The damage shield will do you more harm than the pet. so just focus on killing the mage outright. You've got plenty of HP. Dont think you are invincible and take all of his spells, throw a stun in there when he is casting his bigger spells. And you will probably half to use your LH on this one. If the mage has a damage shield on him, use Dispell Magic and get rid of it. And never never use a 1hs, you want to do as much damage as possible.
    <P> For fighting Necromancers, here's the tricky part. You need to cast your buffs on yourself in this order: STR buff, yaulp (1,2,or3), then your HP buffs (one of your symbols) then yaulp again, then cast your ac/hp buff(courage/center/daring). Don't worry about casting your AC buff, it takes too long to cast. Now cancel your STR buff and let your yaulp run out. You will have two slots up top where the necromancers dot's will be placed, and you can dispell them quickly without dispelling your own buffs. When battle starts, fear his pet. That should be your first move. Then cast dispell magic to remove whatever dot he has on you. Now stun him and root him, and close in to finish him off as quick as you can, and keep him stunned/rooted any chance you get to recast, but make sure you aren't disrupting your attack delay too much, becuase MR. Pet is coming back to help his master. So kill him quickly.
<P>
For fighting Hybrids, you want your 2hs. You have the second highest AC in the game, even without your shield. You also want to buff yourself with as many buffs as you can. <P>
For warriors, very simple. This will be a semi-long battle, so give yourself the Symbol, AC, AC/HP buffs, and yaulp. When you are down to 40% life, stun/root and pull back and heal yourself a bit. You won't beat a warrior in straight up melee, so you have to judge when it's time to pull back and heal. If the warrior starts throwing stuff at you, or shooting arrows, stun his butt again and beging healing. The battle should be over soon, but don't underestimate a warrior's power once he's beserk.  A warrior at 40% life can take down a Paladin at 100% life. You might want to stun/root and heal again, and of course, blind is always useful for those free hits.<P>
     For fighting rangers, simple. This is probably the easiest melee class to beat. This battle won't be a long one, even if you aren't buffed to full. A ranger has very few HP compared to you, and although he has offensive spells, none of them will do more damage than one of your heals.You can do two things here. First, you can sit there and take all of his mana (if he tries to kite you) and just heal yourself while his spells are hitting you for minimal damage. Then finish him off by melee. If he runs (they always do - I hate that) then use the stun/root combo to plant his chicken butt and cut him down. The second strategy is much more offensive. He will probably have a damage sheild up, and this works wether or not he will try to kite you. Start off by stunning, then dispell. Root and fight until your stun is up agian. Then stun again then dispell. Keep his butt planted, cause for some reason ppl never fight to the end, they always run like a chicken when they know they are beat (which is why I think us paladins should get tracking - bwahaha). Once the damage sheild is gone, your set to kill. Even if you have to use LH, you still have FAR more hitpoints than he'll ever have. To put it one way, a 45th paladin non buffed has just as many HP as a 45th ranger does with full Cleric/shaman/ranger buffs. That's alot. 
  <P>   For fighting bards, here is the tough one. Bards have numerous songs which can make your duel miserable, so you want a mass save vs magic. And stun him as much as possible. You want to switch to a one hander for this one, as when he is rooted, you can run up and bash him, knocking off all his songs. Stun will do the same, but only use that if you need to get him at a ranged distance. You can also be feared, but don't worry, your AC will really help you here, as his hits wont hurt nearly as much, so just weather through it when you are immobolized/feared. When you are unfeared, he's gotta run for dear life -- you would too with a pissed off Paladin in full plate :)<P>
The Bard won't have alot of HP, again, around the Ranger's range of HP. So just be careful about your timing with stun, as if he's not singing any songs, Stun really isn't as useful as a good healing spell)
 <P>   Rogues are another story. Any rogue would understand that they don't hold a candle to Paladins in melee. So you need to constantly root them, as they will be running all over trying to wiggle that blade in your back. You can back yourself into a wall or keep him rooted, one or the other, and stun is always useful for getting those extra few seconds for spell casting. If you get placed with a poison, just wear it out, don't try to cure it, his weapons will probably have to low  adelay and be interrupting you anyway.<P>
    ShadowKnights. Ouch. You may not know it, but SK's hurt ALOT in duels. One, they have that damn pet, which you need to fear. Two, they have HT. So that's a good chunk of your life gone. Three, they have the dot spells of a necromancer and the power of a paladin in melee. So keep up with the Stun/Dispell method to get rid of those dots' on you. You will most likely have to use your LayHands because of his HarmTouch.
    <P> Monks are simple. You'll take some damage, but they can't do anything other than melee you. Thier low hitpoints are thier major handicap, and although you will take more damage from them, you will win, as monks have a low Magic Resistance, and just stun/root them to go give yourself a few heals. It will be a quick battle. 
   <P>  Clerics are a joke in duels. You can stand there and let them drain ALL of thier mana on offensive spells on you, and when they come up for melee you will just cut them down where they stand. No contest. 
   <P>  For Druids, the only way they can fight is by kiting you. If they are dumb enough to melee you, take advantage of it and pound them silly. Their dots are not very worrysome, just dispell it. And same tactic with the Necromancer, if they try to kite you, stun/root them. Another funny thing to do with druids is to just stand there and let them hit you with all thier spells. Use your own healing spells to counter the damage, and make sure you have those spaces up top of your buffs so you can dispell the dot's. But I rarely use this tactic, cause I haven't found an honorable druid dueler. Once they are oom they will run and hide, and come back at you with full mana. If you have been playing this duel smart, you'll still have your LH. And if they start to run, stun. Don't ever use a 1hs on a druid, as they ALWAYS put up a damage sheild. In the beginning of a fight, use the stun/root/dispell/stun/dispell method. Druids can't take out a good paladin dueler. So be careful and timing is everything.<P>
     Shamans are pretty much the same way, except they have a pet. Just root the pet, root the Shaman, ignore the spells and melee. The pet will be rooted for a long time, and just keep whacking on the shaman. He has not enough HP to keep him alive until his dot's do thier damage, and his DD spells are easily taken down with a quick stun. 
      

     <P> Lastly, against another Paladin. I would suggest that both of you  just go head to head. I've fought only one other paladin in a duel, she being 7 levels higher than me I had some ppl throw a few heals on me, but I won. You can always root the paladin, but they can dispell it. It's a 50-50 chance who will win, guess it comes down to what gear you have. Remember, AC will help you in the long run, so will a higher ATT (attack). Try to go for the bigger heavier weapons, as us Paladins don't get dual wield, so the little quick swords are a nightmare for us.
<P>

And to all of you out there, Duel with Honor! Don't run away like a coward when you know you are beat! Stand and fight like a true warrior or caster! The only duels that disgust me are the cat and mouse duels. 
<P>
