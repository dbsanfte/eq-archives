Ryshon Hunsti says, 'Hello Kalerien. What brings you to the Karanas? Do you seek
[enlightenment]?<br>
<br>
You say, 'I seek enlightenment'<br>
<br>
Ryshon Hunsti says, 'Ahh, i could see by the look in your eyes that you are
looking for something more than just enlightenment. Perhapsa you are looking for
a [sword] crafted by a noble man.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what sword'<br>
<br>
Ryshon Hunsti says, 'It is not just a sword friend. It is much more than that.
This sword carries with it special [power], something unlike anything else
within this realm.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what power'<br>
<br>
Ryshon Hunsti says, 'It is an instrument fashioned together by noble man. It is
said to be blessed by the gods themselves. Only a man who comes from nobility
may wield it. Do you seek the [sword of nobility]?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'I seek the sword of nobility'<br>
<br>
Ryshon Hunsti says, 'I see, then take this note to Kanthuk Ogrebane. I've been
told he can be found fishing not far from the dwarven city.'<br>
<br>
Recieve a Note for Kanthuk, lore, nodrop, and unreadable.<br>
<br>
Travel to Butcherblock Mts to the boat docks. If you go around the wall on the
north side to the shore line and follow that north you will find Kanthuk
Ogrebane standing there.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Kanthuk Ogrebane'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'Hello Kalerien'<br>
<br>
Hand Kanthuk the note and get some experience.<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'Ahh, I see you have spoke to Ryshon. You seem tired from
your long journey. Sit with me as I tell you a tale. A tale about a true friend
of mine, a great man known as [Amstaf Trunolis].'<br>
<br>
You say, ' Who is amstaf trunolis'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk ogrebane says, 'Amstaf Trunolis was a good man. I've followed into
[battle] many times. We've seen many of our friends die by the sword of others.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what battle'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane laughes, 'I remember the first time we charged into battle. I
was so scared. My hands wouldn't stop trembling. Amstaf pulled me off to the
side before<br>
the initial attack began. He held my hands within his. I saw his hands begin to
glow and felt his energy pass into me. I felt [courage].<br>
<br>
You say, 'what courage'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'I'll never forget what he did for me that day. He gave
me the courage to continue. No one's ever done anything like that for me. I
vowed that day that I'd follow him into any battle. I'd be there alongside him,
no matter what. As time went on we came across an elven woman named [Ambreen].<br>
<br>
You say, 'who is ambreen'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'Ambreen was younger than he and I. She knew of the
powers of nature. She was able to control the rain which fell from the heavens
and would<br>
call upon the spirits to aide her. It was obvious that Amstaf took a liking to
Ambreen. She ended up coming with is on out crusades. The last I saw of Ambreen
was when we went to the snow covered lands of Everfrost. We were wander the
lands when a freak [snowstorm] hit us. We were seperated from one another for
quite some time.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what snowstorm'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'I don't know where it came from, but it was so sudden
that it caught us all off guard. The snow quickly became unbearable. I tried to
move to higher ground, but was unable to. I was stuck within the snowy confines.
I didn't know what to do [next].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what happened next'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'As I laid there my body began to slowly freeze. I knew
death was near and accepted the inevitable. Suddenly I felt something clutching
at my cloak. I was being dragged upwards out of the snow. A hand pressed against
my chest and began to glow. I felt energy pass into my body. Do you know [how]
he had saved me?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'how did he save you'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'He saved my life by laying his hands upon my body. A few
moments later we found Ambreen lying in the snow, her body frozen by the harsh
surroundings. We lifted her up off the ground and began to look for [shelter].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what shelter'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'We ended up taking refuge within a deserted cabin not to
far from our location. We knew that we didn't have much time left to bring life
back into her body. However, the storm didn't pass through and we knew we
couldn't venture to far without the fear of freezing. I warmed the cabin and
rested for some time thinking about what we were going to do. It wasn't long
before my exhaustion took over. I fell into a deep [slumber] that night.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what slumber'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'That night I dreamt of many things. Random thoughts kept
swirling around my mind. I kept seeing the image of a cloaked being and of
Amstaf circled around a fire. I saw Ambreen's body convulsing above the fire as
if life was being brought back to it. I don't know what happened that night. I
don't even know if what i dreamt was real, but before I awoke I saw a [strange
image].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'waht strange image'<br>
<br>
Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'I saw Amstaf lower his head and walked away in silence.
He was surronded by two beings carrying a torch. I don't know what it meant, but
I swear it was so real. When I awoke both Amstaf and Ambreen were gone. Please
find Llara and give this pendant to her. This pendant belonged to Amstaf. She
too had a vision that night that may clear things up. If she asks where you got
it from, mention my name.'<br>
<br>
You Recieve a pendant, magic, lore, nodrop, +1cha, pal only, hum hie dwf eru<br>
<br>
Next you need to find Llara. She is standing on a rock outside of Unrest.<br>
<br>
Llara says 'Oh my! This belongs to Amstaf. Where did you get it?<br>
<br>
You say, 'kanthuk gave it to me'<br>
<br>
Llara says 'I take it you're here to find out more about [Amstaf].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Who was Amstaf?'<br>
<br>
Llara says 'I've known Amstaf since he was a child. We grew up in the same city
together. Ever since I've known him there's always been something [unusual]
about him.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What was unusual?'<br>
<br>
Llara says 'When we were growing up we used to venture outside the city gates.
Some times we would encounter a wandering ghoul or an undead spirit of some
sort. He was always able to quickly dismiss the undead being with very little
effort. I [learned] many things growing up with Amstaf.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What did you learn?'<br>
<br>
Llara says 'Amstaf told me many things when we were younger. Once Amstaf told me
that life isn't about how you get there, it's about where you end up. I miss my
dear friend. Its been a long time since I've seen him. The night of the
snowstorm I dreamt about him. I remember seeing Amstaf's face. I saw something
I've never [seen] before.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What did you see?'<br>
<br>
Llara says 'I saw desperation. I spoke to many people who knew Amstaf trying to
find out if anyone heard anything about that night. No one knew anything about
it. When I had reached the dwarven hunting grounds I ran into a woman named
Walnan. She kept rambling on and on about the power of the Orb and something
about Magi`kot. I didn't understand what she was saying. She didn't know
anything about my situation either, but she did tell me that there were others
that may be able to help me. She told me that I should find [Ruathey].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Who is Ruathey?'<br>
<br>
Llara says 'Ruathey is known for her ability to look into people's souls and
find truth. Though I wasn't able to find Amstaf, I was able to recover his
sword. I believe that by having his sword I am closer to finding him. Take this
note to Ruathey and tell her that I sent you.<br>
<br>
Next you find Ruathey she is in Lavastorm, near the Nek zone -- a little to the
west<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Ruathey'<br>
<br>
Ruathey says 'Hello Chork .'<br>
<br>
Ruathey says 'I see that you've spoken to Llara. She too came to me looking for
Amstaf. Though she wasn't able to find her friend, she was able to recover his
[sword].<br>
<br>
You say, 'What sword?'<br>
<br>
Ruathey says 'I've heard stories about a holy sword. There are many rumored to
be hidden all throughout the world, yet only a few have actually been found.
Amstaf had one of these swords. It is known for its ability to dismiss the
undead. Perhaps by having this sword it'll bring you closer to finding your
friend. Gather a ghoul's heart, Amstaf's Scroll, the Blade of Nobility, a
noblemans hilt and place them in this [bag].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What bag?'<br>
<br>
Ruathey says 'Take this bag and gather the items I've mentioned. I've been told
that the Ghoul's Heart can be found in the estate of the undead, while the
scroll can be found in the Keep not far from the Karanas. One of the others are
rumored to be found near the dwarven city among the goblins. While the last
should be found in the caverns of Najena.<br>
<br>
For those of you who haven't figured it out, you will need to go to ButcherBlock,
Highhold Keep, Unrest, and Najena.<br>
<br>
<b>Your target is Crazed Ghouls in Unrest<br>
<br>
Your target is Crazed Goblins (possibly Goblin Thieves too) in HighKeep.<br>
<br>
Your target is the high level skeletons in Najena (right inside zone past first
skel)<br>
<br>
And there is a small ruins that was previoulsy uninhabited, but now has goblins
and crazed goblins in Butcherblock.<br>
</b><br>
All the mobs that need to be killed are from level&nbsp; 25 to up to level 35, and the items appear to
be uncommon drops.<br>
<br>
You combine these 4 items in the bag Ruathey give you and You have fashioned the
items together to create something new!</span></p>
