      <b><font color='#800000'>Introduction</font></b>
      <p>
      
      There are three classes in the game which can use the feign death
      ability.&nbsp; Monks, Necromancers
      and Shadow Knights.&nbsp; Monks have feign death as an actual skill, whereas Necromancers and
      Shadow Knights must use a spell.&nbsp; <span class='db2'><a href='http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spelldescriptions.asp?Id=407' target='_blank' class='db2'>Necromancers</a></span>
      receive the spell at Level 16 and <span class='db2'><a href='http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spelldescriptions.asp?Id=1370' class='db2' target='_blank'>Shadow
      Knights</a></span> at 30.&nbsp; It is arguably the most useful
      ability in the game, providing not only a way to save valuable experience
      from dying, but also as a way of separating groups of monsters when
      fighting.</p>
      <p><font color='#800000'><b>General Description</b></font></p>
      <p>Feign death is the ability to fool mobs into believing that you are dead when you are
      actually still alive. This is very useful when close to death and aren't
      near a zone.&nbsp; You can merely feign death and the mobs will forget you.  It is
      not however fool proof and feign death has two ways of failing.</p>
      <p>The most typical
      way is when you receive the message '&lt;player1> has fallen to the
      ground'.&nbsp; This signifies that you have not feigned successfully,
      and the mob(s) will treat
      you as an alive enemy and carry on attacking.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      
      The other cause of feign death failing was originally thought of as a bug but turned out to be
      Verant's
      way of showing 'nothing is certain'.&nbsp; What happens is just before
      you go to feign death the mob launches an attack, whether through casting or
      melee, and as you feign the mob registers that you are dead, <u>but</u> it does not
      pull back on its swing or stop casting.  The result of which is that it
      still hits you on the floor.&nbsp; Upon learning that even though are
      &quot;dead&quot; you do in fact take damage, they are smart enough to
      realize you are still alive and they will restart their attack.  The only way around
      this is timing, you have to try time your feign just after the mobs finishes
      its attack.&nbsp; There is no you can skill raise which can affect this.</p>
      <p>
      
      There is also in the case of Shadow Knights and Necromancers the fact that
      you may not be able to cast the spell.&nbsp; This may be due to attacks interrupting your
      spell or through fizzling.&nbsp; This is not a feign death fail as such, as you
      haven't actually fallen.  To avoid this from happening try to&nbsp; make sure that
      your magical skills are maxed out at all levels.</p>
      <p>
      
      In the case of Monks the
      higher your feign death skill the more likely you are to be successful in
      your attempt to fool them.&nbsp; For Necromancers and Shadow Knights your Abjuration
      and Channelling skills are the determining factor.</p>
      <p>
      
      <b><font color='#800000'>
      
      Other Techniques for Success</font></b></p>
      <p>Monks in general will find that once they are
      maxed in skill they will have few problems pulling off a feign, unless they
      are being bombarded by spells which will still hit you when on the
      floor.&nbsp; The best idea in this case is to try distance your self out of their casting
      range before feigning, or to time your feign after the last spell and before
      the casting begins on the next one.&nbsp; Once the casting has started you
      <u>will</u> be hit unless someone manages to interrupt the monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p> Shadow Knights and
      Necromancers will often need
      much more space to pull off a feign as they have to wait for casting time
      and the possibility of interruption. The easiest way to stop interrupts is to
      find a corner and lodge yourself firmly there so that the mobs will not move
      you when they attack.&nbsp; You can also use the monsters themselves as a 'brake' by running into them.&nbsp;
      This solves the common mistake of casting before you come to a stand still and
      being interrupted before even being hit.</p>
      <p>
      
      <font color='#800000'><b>Results</b></font></p>
      <p>
      
 Once you are feigned mobs will stop attacking you and react in
      various ways.  If they are also agro on another player, they will
      immediately resume their attack or chase on them.&nbsp; If they were only agro on you
      they will stop and wait over you till they eventually return back to their
      spawn points or carry on their roaming pattern.&nbsp; The amount of time they
      will wait above you is random and will change with every NPC you
      encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      
      In the past people have often been worried
      about healing someone who is feigned as they thought it might bring a
      train of mobs down upon them.&nbsp; This is not truly something which is a
      problem as the only time
      the mob will agro on the healer is if the feign fails in any of the ways
      mentioned above.&nbsp; If you have feigned successfully the mobs will not
      agro on other people no matter what spells are cast on you while you are
      pretending to be dead.</p>
      <p>
      
      <b><font color='#800000'>
      
      Standing Up</font></b></p>
      <p>When you stand up after a feign death, if the previously aggro'd mobs were below
      Level 35 there will be no repercussions as the mob will have
      no recollection of you and carry on as normal.  Mobs above Level 35 however have
      a chance to re agro on you.&nbsp; If they do, they will go directly to you as if
      you were still an enemy.  If you have stayed down long enough for the mob
      to return to its spawn point, then there
      is a 90% chance it wont agro on you again.&nbsp; However, if it is still roaming there
      is an 80% chance that it <u>will</u> agro on you again.&nbsp; Don't be too
      worried though, you do have the chance to
      re-feign and each subsequent feign reduces the chances of re-agro by
      roughly 20%.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>  This rule is not universal however.&nbsp; Certain factors can
      influence it and different mobs will react in different ways.&nbsp;
      Distances from the
      mob when you stand up can affect its chance of re-aggroing, and some mobs
      will forget every time but will remember if you get close in the future.  A
      way around this is to /quit while feigning death.&nbsp; This causes you to go link
      dead, but keeps you feigned, and so after three minutes you will time out as if
      you had camped and will lose all mob agro.  However, before you do this you
      should make sure you are in an area with no mobs around, this will stop
      others from aggroing on you as you will log back in standing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>  Also remember
      you will lose any no-rent items, or summoned food or water that you had and will
      also lose your group spot.&nbsp; Monks should never be group leaders when
      feign death pulling as
      they will bug their group if they have to /q and party members will have
      to all camp out and re-login to reform..</p>
     
      <p><b><font color='#800000'>Status While Feigned</font></b></p>
     
      <p>While you are feigning death there are certain restrictions applied to your character. Your
      health and mana regeneration rates are
      reduced to 1/3 of their normal rate, you cannot move, cast spells, trade or
      camp.&nbsp; You can however pan out into different views which can be useful if
      trying to see which mobs are close, and in monks case you can use mend to regain
      health.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> As your regenerations are reduced buffs such as chloroplast, clarity etc. are very useful to someone who is going to be using feign
      death a lot.&nbsp; If pulling you will also want to have all possible
      Agility and Armour Class buffs to reduce being hit, and if an Enchanter is
      in your party, Berserker or Rune spells provide a nice little extra damage
      absorption.</p>
      <p>
      
      
      <b><font color='#800000'>Application</font></b></p>
      <p>
      
      
      The general application for all three classes with this skill is to avoid dying when
      in trouble.&nbsp; However the skill has to be used differently by each class, and can
      have further uses as one becomes a more experienced player.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Keep in mind also that a Necromancer or Shadow Knight skeleton pet will
      suicide after two minutes of its master being feigned, a charmed pet will
      be instantly released..&nbsp; Here is a summary below of some of the extra
      uses for feigning death:</p>
      <p><b>Necro</b><b>mancer<br>
      </b>As a Necromancer you will often be doing massive amounts of
      damage to mobs from your powerful spells.&nbsp; This however can cause the mob to
      agro on you very quickly.&nbsp; Feigning death in this instance is very useful to
      lose the mobs agro so it goes back on party tanks or if soloing, your pet.</p>
      <p>Also Necromancers who find themselves deep in an area with no way out
      and a train of mobs,
      instead of trying to squeeze in an uninterrupted gate, can feign death and /quit.&nbsp;
      Then once they log back in, they can
      attempt to gate when they have more time. This is due to the difference
      in casting time between gate and feign.&nbsp; Feign requires only 1.5
      seconds,
      Gate on the other hand requires 5.0 seconds.</p>
      <p>
      
      <b>Monk</b><b> and Shadow Knight<br>
      </b>  Although Monks and Shadow Knights use different
      techniques to feign they have the same applications of the ability.&nbsp; Feign
      death can be very useful while tanking to give the Cleric that extra second
      to pull of a heal on you.&nbsp; This is because it will divert the mobs attention from you to another
      player.&nbsp; It is also very useful for scouting out areas as you are the most likely to be
      able to escape in case of mass agro.  However, the primary application of the
      feign death skill for Monks and Shadow Knights is &quot;feign and
      tag&quot; pulling, an in
      depth description is below.</p>
      <p>
      
      <b><font color='#800000'>&quot;Feign &amp; Tag&quot; Pulling</font></b></p>
      <p>
      
      Feign pulling is used to pull single mobs from large
      groupings of mobs, usually when the group is especially dangerous or beyond the group(s)
      ability to kill.  Previously feign pulling was much easier than it is now,
      this is due to changes that were implemented modifying how a mob reacts
      when you stand up.  The current sub-35 feign pulling tactic is same as it
      used to be for all monsters.  The sub-35 tactic is to pull a group of mobs to a pre-determined
      area and feign death, you then wait till as many of the mobs have left and
      stand up and bringing a single mob.  This can prove difficult at times as the
      mobs will often leave in groups and you may have to settle for bringing
      two mobs or repeating the process till you get one by themselves.</p>
      <p>
      
      Since the modifications implemented last year, feign pulling in higher-level
      areas evolved into tag pulling.  The problem found was that when you stood
      up to bring in the single mob left, all the others would come back after
      you.  So to get round this you have to get someone else come &quot;tag&quot; the single
      mob off you.&nbsp; Tagging normally involves hitting the monster with a
      ranged weapon such as a bow or a thrown dagger.&nbsp; Having a Magician
      with you to summon these items is always a good idea.&nbsp; &quot;Feign
      &amp; Tag&quot; pulling requires good coordination between the tagger and puller
      so the mob does not get away.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      
  After the mob is tagged you then have two options.&nbsp; You can either wait till the mob is dead and
      then stand up and repeat
      the process as the already angered mobs come back at you, or alternatively
      you can risk standing up and
      joining in with the fight.&nbsp; you should only take this risk if you think the mobs have returned to their spawn
      points and have forgotten you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      Monks being able to feign easier than Shadow Knights will find this much easier to pull off, but
      Shadow Knights are more
      likely to reach the feign point on long pulls due to their better tanking abilities.  When
      tag pulling, having two people in the group who can feign can make it much
      easier, as one of them can go feign before in the area which the puller will
      feign at, and as such will be able to tell himself when he can safely tag
      and not have to rely on the puller telling him.  If you don't have two feign
      pullers it is best to make sure that the person who is tagging knows not to
      tag till you say or you may find him training your whole group.</p>

      <font color='#800000'><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
      <p>The usage of feign death is complex and diverse.&nbsp; However, it
      takes time to learn to use the ability for pulling and it is not something
      people can expect to be immediately adept at.&nbsp; Remember, not only
      must you master the skill yourself if you wish to &quot;feign and
      tag&quot; pull, but you must also develop good relationships with taggers
      and healers to maximise its use.&nbsp; Once you
      try feign pulling you will see how fun it is and how lucky those people
      are who have the skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;
