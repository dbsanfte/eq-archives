<p>---------------<br>
The Many Misadventures of Fry<br>
---------------------------------<br>
Chapter 1 Fry, the thief.....er scout..<br>
<br>
It was a dark and stormy night as many a tale begins. My beloved
husband snuck<br>
through the hallowed halls of Felwithe his prize at hand, easily
bypassing the guards and<br>
security measures, at only the tender age of 14. Which is very
young, especially for an<br>
elf. Who's lifespan is measured in centuries, not decades like
the humans that are likely<br>
to read this biography.<br>
<br>
Well, I suppose I am jumping ahead of things aren't I? I guess I
should let you in a on<br>
few details on the life of my husband and maybe if I feel like it
a little about myself.<br>
<br>
My husband, if you haven't guessed already is Fry as he likes to
be called, though his<br>
birth name is Frydious Angus-Bilbao Menlore..though you can see
why he just likes to be<br>
called Fry..his parents must have had some really good evergreen
leaves when they<br>
named him..but I am wandering again. Well, to start things off
Fry was one bedazzled<br>
and trained in the arts of theivery or also known as the roguish
arts. Everyone, just like<br>
everyone else who weren't of his guild and specialty called him
exactly that a rogue and<br>
theif, hm I can hear him now screaming to the heavans that he was
not a rogue, he was<br>
Scout. A scout of the Goddess Tunare! Proud defender of Faydwer,
and scourge of<br>
evil.....though he just tended to blow up stuff and get chassed
by Orcs and<br>
Brownies...but if you think about it , it's almost the same isn't
it? Well, I am jumping<br>
ahead again..<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's see what is a good way to start....o yeah silly me, more
about Fry. You see Fry<br>
was the son of Augustas Menlore a powerful Geomancer and Mariea
Ali, one of Kelethin's<br>
scouts. Sadly though one day when Fry was only 6, his father
disappeared..some say he<br>
was killed, some say he abandoned Mariea and Fry, but who really
knows but him.<br>
Because of that Fry grew up in the company of rogues...scouts and
like his mother<br>
sought to become a legend amoung the guild. He spent every waking
moment learning<br>
eerything he could, honing his skills and masterng them. And at
the tender age of 14<br>
breaking al kinds of records, was given a test of passing.<br>
<br>
Now as the name sounds, this test was designed to ensure only the
best students,<br>
would become full members of the Scout's guild and learn the
guarded secrets of<br>
Scouting. Because of his natural prowess, Young Fry was given the
hardest Test everr<br>
given, he was to break into Felwithe Castle and remove 1 item of
worth from the royal<br>
quarters. Simply put, he had to get past, the most heavily
defended area in the known<br>
world and steal something from either the King's, the Queen's or
the Princess's room. Not<br>
an easy task for any one, even for Fry. So to make it somewhat
more fair and to test<br>
another student who was breaking records, Fry was partnered with
a girl 2 years his<br>
senior by the name of Reverdone Moocienaga Dal Kampo Ciba or Rev
for short...I think<br>
Fry's and Rev's parents shared the same stash..but any way I am
drifting..<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Smothered in the shadows, Fry peers out from the Guard Tower
across the town square,<br>
looking for the best point of entry into Felwithe Castle. He
sighed, he tiring of waiing on<br>
Rev, she was so slow when it came to scaling walls.<br>
<br>
He gazed up at the stars and began to drift away, hewa kind of
tired, i had been a really<br>
long week with all of the tests, but soon it will be all over.
Soon he will ba ful member of<br>
the Scout's of Tunare. He will get his Cape and seal and he will
be shown the guild's<br>
secret skills and most importantly, the secrets of tracking.
Maybe finally armed with that<br>
knowledge, he could fnd Pop. Finally,he would know why he leftso
suddenly....why he<br>
left Mo-<br>
<br>
Ahand touched his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fry.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AAAAHH!!&quot; He shouted nearly jumping out of his skin.
&quot;Don't do that Rev!&quot;<br>
<br>
The young Wood Elf girl scooted up beside him and crouched upon
thee tower edge,<br>
giving him a quick smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are such a scardy-cat Fry.&quot; SHe giggled and
brushed her flowing hair back bit, in<br>
doing so she released a bit of even from Fry. As she reached up,
she inadvertently<br>
moved er cloak, reveaing her Scout knife. He envied that so, he
wanted a Scout Knife<br>
also and he would have had it f it weren't for his reluctance in
combat. Not to say that<br>
he was a poorly skilled fighter, even his Guildmaster had to
admit that Fry was rapidly<br>
becoming better he was. It was just that Fry could never, no
matter the circumstances<br>
or the imagined scenarios given to him by his teachers, could he
strike what would be a<br>
fatal blow. It was because of that, he would never get a scout's
knife, the Scout<br>
symbol of absolute deadliness.<br>
<br>
He quickly pushed that thought aside, and focused back onthe
mission. <br>
<br>
&quot;Let's go&quot; He pulled his cloak back over him and leapt
of the high guard tower. Rev<br>
mimiced him and for a few countless seconds they fell down and
down until they landed<br>
like cats upon thestraw thatchel roof of a peasant home. They
both dashed forward,<br>
quickly getting up to a fast klip, dashing across the roof and
then leaping to the next<br>
roof. Playing a silent game of leapfrog across the roofs of the
inhabtants below.<br>
<br>
Quickly and silently, thay made it to Felwthe castle. Where they
rendevouzed once<br>
again, in the shadows just beyond the sight of the porticullis
Gaurds.<br>
<br>
Rev scanned up, and began to thread a lin through her grappling
hook.<br>
<br>
&quot;You still use that clunky thing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why not just run up like we where taught?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't do it, I keep slipping.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How dd you pass teh climbing test?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Patience, a friend and 30 platinum coins.&quot; she beamed<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmph.. ANy way, lets do this witha little style.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Straight through the front entrance?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How? There is nowhere to hide, to get around them. To much
light.&quot; She said referring<br>
to the 15 torches spread around the entrance.<br>
<br>
It was Fry's turn to beam. &quot;Watch and learn, little
one&quot; He said imitating the Guild<br>
leader. He removed two throwing daggers from his utility pouch
and a bottle of fluid. He<br>
quickly dipped the daggers in the fluid and then put the bottle
back in the pouch.<br>
Moving away a bit to get a better angle, he lined up and then
hurled the daggers at the<br>
two guards, each one striking a guard just at the seam between
their plate mail armor.<br>
<br>
The guards looked pained for a moment, then collapsed backwards
and began to snore.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry took the bottle back out and let Rev smell what was in it.
She coughed and smiled a<br>
bit. &quot;Evergreen leaf elixir&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, when you need something great for parties and
knocking out inept castle guards,<br>
I highly recommend it. Heh, they are going to wake up feeling
like a million platinum. And<br>
they are going to need it too, when the King chews them out for
letting us get past so<br>
easily.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah&quot;<br>
<br>
With out another word both of them dashed across the open field
and through the<br>
portcullis and into the previously impregnable fortress Castle
Felwithe. The next 15<br>
minutes were variations of the same event, repeated dozens upon
dozens of times.<br>
Whether they used a throwing dagger to disable an armored guard,
or a cloth soaked in<br>
the elixir to mug an inept servant, it was all the same. In that
bit of time Fry and Rev<br>
had completely incapacitated the entire eastern section of
Felwithe castle. Leaving<br>
them to plunder the riches within the inner sanctum. They
wouldn't even have to worry<br>
about King Tearis or his new Queen Mysonia. They were out
exploring the country side<br>
alone, a sort of second honeymoon. That left only the beloved&#133;to
the general<br>
population&#133; lovely and funny&#133;to Rev.. snot nosed brat&#133;to
Fry&#133; Princess Tyia, the Kings<br>
only heir, now that Fironia disappeared. She and her personal
Templar protectors would<br>
be the only ones left&#133; This time of the night though, she
should be in bed sleeping<br>
soundly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know the way to the King's room Rev?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No&#133; I thought you did? This is my first time
here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;&#133;.Hmm.. I was here a couple of times before..but that
was a long time ago&#133;I haven't<br>
been back because of that stupid snot nosed brat..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You shouldn't talk about her like that. She is the
Princess.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;&#133;hmph I don't care who she is&#133;.she stole my
fireworks&#133;&quot;<br>
-----------<br>
I guess, I should interrupt and explain this. You see as you
already know, Fry's mother is<br>
one of the best scouts in the land and is frequently called on by
the King. After she<br>
gave birth to Fry and was ready to go back to service she did so
only for the highest of<br>
priority missions. During the time she was away, the King
graciously allowed young Fry<br>
to stay in Felwithe castle under his and Lady Mysonia's
supervision. That also meant he<br>
was around Tyia a lot. As he told me, one day when his mother was
dispatched. She<br>
gave him some Gnomish Fireworks to play with..and according to
him. Tyia took them<br>
and ran away. He lost her and was only able to find her by the
sounds and sights of the<br>
fireworks going off&#133;h obviously never forgave her for that&#133;and
neither did she when he<br>
whapped her on the head with Battle and Calm&#133;a fairly large
book for a 6 year old. Thus<br>
she cried bloody murder, and when his mother returned he was
barred from Felwithe<br>
until he apologized to the King and to Tyia&#133;..suffice to say
the King got an apology and<br>
Fry had never returned to Felwithe castle until that night to rob
it.<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
Rev tried to remain composed, but burst with laughter at the
serious face of Fry. <br>
<br>
'You are still made at her over that? That was years ago!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah..but they where mine and really good ones too,
FuzzleCutter 7000's &#133;they don't<br>
make them any more.&quot; His eyes filled with tears.<br>
<br>
Rev just laughed harder and just walked away trying to compose
herself. Fry wiped his<br>
tears away, sniffed and cried again at the loss of those really
great fireworks.<br>
-----------------------<br>
I guess I should interrupt again. The reason Fuzzlecutter 7000's
aren't made any more,<br>
are because of the large amount of firewater and other explosive
materiel inside of<br>
them. Not that they are unsafe to set of, unlike the rest of
gnomish inventions, they<br>
only blew up when they are supposed to. They don't make them any
more because they<br>
simply burned too long and don't stay airborne long enough before
they flame<br>
out&#133;&#133;simply put&#133;.unlike what most people today
think&#133;it wasn't logging or farming that<br>
cleared out the Commons of Antonica.<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
A few moments later, Rev and Fry are running for a hiding place
as a contingent of<br>
guards make a sweep of the inner sanctum. In a rush they find
themselves, in the Royal<br>
bath. A large room filled with scents, oils, and platinum. Enough
finery that could feed a<br>
nation for years all in one room. And in the center of the two
story bathing room a large<br>
pool that filled almost half the bottom floor. Both of them
walked around mouths open<br>
and the splendor and majesty. Rev walked up to the second floor
to admire the indoor<br>
waterfall that fed pool.<br>
<br>
&quot;WOW!!!!&quot; fry exclaimed after coming out of his state
of disbelief. :We don't even need<br>
to go any farther. We can loot this place!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah right. You know how much of a stickler the guild
master is. He said only from the<br>
Royal quarters. This though rich&#133;is not the Royal quarters&#133;&quot;
She called down to him<br>
<br>
&quot;Still&#133;. do you think they would miss some of this
stuff?&quot; he called back holding up a<br>
crystal flask filled with scented oils. &quot;Mom would love
this. It's smells nice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Put it down Fry..You Know we have to give what we take
back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I know&#133;It's no fair..why does she get to have
all this stuff&#133;Mom should get this<br>
not that brat&#133;&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's just how it-&quot; Rev was cut short as the doors
began to creep open. Rev instantly<br>
stepped back into the shadows concealing her, while Fry hid
underneath a table with<br>
some of oils and scents.<br>
<br>
&quot;laalalalala&#133;&quot; A girl hummed as she entered the
room sealing the doors. She walked<br>
slowly and without a care in the world to the very table where
fry was hiding under<br>
neath. <br>
<br>
&quot;Lalala..lalal&#133;alalala&#133;&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry covered his ears at Tyia's horrid off-key humming and pray
for a swift and merciful<br>
death.but he was not so luckily, he endured her humming and
watched as she got closer<br>
to the table, her white robe covering her, she stepped up to the
table and began to<br>
clink and clatter with some of the flasks right above Fry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perfect&quot;, she said to herself..or so she thought. Fry
watched as she turned around and<br>
the white robe disappeared revealing another two white things in
front of him. He stared<br>
unabashedly mouth agape.<br>
<br>
&quot;STOP GAWKING!&quot; Rev shouted the best she could in the
silent signing of Scout's Cant.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't help it..Hehehehe. This is great!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You lecherous&#133;Hmm wait. She has a Platinum comb she
put on top of her robe. We can<br>
take that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds like a plan. But how are we going to get out of
here? She is in the way..not<br>
that I mind.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;&#133;we will just have to wait until she is done and then
leave&#133;so until then STOP<br>
STARING AT THE ROYAL BEHIND!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;hehe&#133;Wait I got an idea. When she gets in the bath
toss me the Evergreen elixir flask.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't be serious! You aren't going to drug the
princess!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why not? It will just go to show even more how pitiful the
security is and may even get<br>
us a batter position when we get back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe&#133;Okay, get ready she is getting in..&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry pulled out his last throwing dagger.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO DAGGERS!!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;&#133;.foo&#133;So much for avenging the fireworks..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are hopeless.&quot;<br>
<br>
While this silent conversation was happening, Tyia steps before
the large bath and pours<br>
lavishing some fairy dust soap powder into pool. Making sparkly,
fizzy bubbles. Se giggles<br>
and puts the fairy dust container back on the table. But what she
doesn't realize and<br>
neither do Fry or Rev, is that the container feel over spilling
its contents across the<br>
table. As the suds get nice and high, she steps in and disappears
under the magical<br>
suds. At that moment Fry gets out from under the table and
motions for Rev to toss the<br>
elixir to him. She does so&#133;<br>
<br>
----------<br>
At this point in time. I feel I should interrupt yet again. You
see Fry, while an expert<br>
Scout, is a just a bit&#133;.okay&#133;.. extremely clumsy. Also
I should mention, That while Fairy<br>
dust makes for excellent sudsy soap and Evergreen elixir is great
for putting people<br>
asleep&#133;together they make a very&#133;&#133;.very&#133;.powerful
explosive&#133;Which is what the<br>
second stage of Fuzzlecutter 7000's were made of by the way.<br>
------------<br>
<br>
Fry opened his ands to catch the sailing flask and did so..but he
flask decided to be<br>
slippery and hopped out of fry's hands and crashed onto the
table, shattering open and<br>
spilling it's contents. The elixir snaked its way around the
table and mixed with the fairy<br>
dust soap powder. Fry stood disbelieving, Tyia who heard the
noise stood up out of the<br>
midst of the soap suds and to see what was happening and was
shock to see, not only<br>
a boy in the Royal bath..but FRY!!! Only rev was semi un fazed.<br>
<br>
&quot;GET DOWN!!!!!&quot; She screamed.<br>
<br>
Fry leapt the best he could away from the table and collided with
Tyia and they both<br>
went under the suds and water. At that moment. The entire left
wall of the Royal Bath<br>
disenagrated with a very loud boom, that echoed throughout not
only the castle but<br>
also all of Felwithe.<br>
<br>
As her ears stopped ringing Rev looked up at the destruction
caused by the elixir and<br>
dust and at the moment as luck would have it a piece of debris
clunked her on the head.<br>
<br>
&quot;OW!&quot; She grumbled and picked up the debris and it
wasn't debris at all. It was Tyia's<br>
Platinum comb, unscathed to. Unlike the rest of the room, which
brought her attention<br>
to Fry.<br>
<br>
&quot;FRY!! You okay!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry found himself very wet and on the receiving end of a very
sharp slap by a soapy<br>
naked Princess.<br>
<br>
&quot;GET OUT YOUR PEEPING Tom!! HOW DARE YOU SNEAK INTO MY ROYAL
BATH!! HOW<br>
DARE YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME!!!&quot; At that moment she
realized what something<br>
disastrous had happened to the left wall.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha?&quot;<br>
<br>
She got of the bath soap and suds dripping everywhere, and stood
in shock at the hole.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fry!! Time to go!!&quot; Rev called sprinting down what was
left of the stairs. Fry pulled<br>
himself out of the bath and dashed after Rev, at that exact
moment the sounds of<br>
heavy clanking armor filled the hallway and entered the large
hole. As Fry and Rev<br>
dashed out in another direction and made their in comparison
uneventful escape, the<br>
heard the screams of an embarrassed Tyia, as she screeched as the
guards saw her<br>
naked and dived back into the bath for cover.<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
The Guild master had his head buried into his hands, as paced
back in forth in front of<br>
Fry and Rev. He had been doing so for the last 3 hours. It was
know the day after, and<br>
he still didn't know what to make of this. Finally he said
something.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT IN THE HELL WHERE YOU TWO DOING!!!! GET IN GET OUT!
THAT&quot;S ALL! STEAL<br>
ONE LITTLE ITEM. I DID NOT DISPATCH YOU TO REDECORATE FELWITHE
CASTLE!!!!!&quot; He<br>
boomed.<br>
<br>
Fry timidly spoke up. &quot;Um sir&#133;aside from the last
little part&#133;We accomplished what we<br>
where sent to do. No one saw us and we acquired the item we where
sent for. Sir&quot;<br>
<br>
The Guild master paced some more. &quot; Yes that is true&#133;&#133;I
just..GAH!!! Why where you in<br>
the Royal bath in the first place Fry!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never mind, save it. I don't want to know. Tell it to the
King.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry went white as a sheet. &quot;The&#133;..The K&#133;KI&#133;&#133;King?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. The King, he wants to talk to you after blowing a hole
in his castle.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry turned even whiter if that was possible. &quot;The&#133;the&#133;the..the..king?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir. I beg you, please don't allow this. It was my fault, I
caused the explosion&quot; rev<br>
interceded<br>
<br>
&quot;The&#133;King&#133;King King&#133;..&quot; Fry continued to
mumble<br>
<br>
&quot;It doesn't matter who did it. He wants to see you two.
Tunare only knows what he has<br>
in store. Go..now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sir&quot; Rev replied, scared for her life, dragging
Fry with her, who was still as a statue<br>
still mumbling. &quot;The..The ..the the the..King..king&#133;.&quot;<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Several hours later, they where in the Royal Throneroom. Rev
solemn and Fry still<br>
mumbling like an idiot. But he finally stopped and Rev relaxed
slightly. When the royal<br>
family entered, th queen smiled looking beautiful and serene as
always. And King Tearis<br>
though calm and disciplined as he was known to be, almost seemed
to be somewhat<br>
jovial&#133;.only Tyia was glowering. But that was understandable
being that she was just<br>
embarrassed in front of half the castle just a day ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;so you two are the impressive Scouts of Kelethin, Master
Rikas has been talking about.<br>
He neer told me you two where such skilled decorators as well as
Scouts.&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Rev chuckled slightly. Fry was still pale.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh come now. I am not angry. I had been planning on having
the inner sanctum redone<br>
any way. And beside if my guards had done a better job, you would
not have put a hole<br>
there in the first place. So be at ease young ones.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rev did so, Fry sighed relieved that he was not going to be
hanged..or something<br>
terrible.<br>
<br>
&quot;But we do have a few small matters ahead of us.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes M'lord?&quot; Fry said, that being the longest coherent
sentence he had said in several<br>
hours.<br>
<br>
&quot;First, the item you took. Please return it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course&quot; Fry opening his belt pouch, and withdrew
Tyia's comb and slowly with it as<br>
far in front of him he could put it, with out being openly
insulting, walked up to Tyia and<br>
let her take it&#133;snatch it really. She glowered at fiercely
and fry quickly returned to his<br>
place by Rev and awaiting for the Kings next matter at hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Second, though I am not angry about the redecoration. I can
not allow you walk away<br>
with reprimand. So before either of you can obtain your guild
cloaks and the rank of<br>
Scout. You must perform a service for me. I will discuss that
matter further with you<br>
when the time comes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lastly.&quot; He stared directly at Fry. &quot;Fry. You
know that the banning I placed on you is<br>
still in effect and it is only by a temporary abstention that you
are here right now or<br>
yesterday. But if you are going to obtain your cloak and rank,
you are going to have to<br>
repay, and in order to do so, you must stay here with my
soldiers. So, if you wish to<br>
continue on your Mother's path. I ask that you apologize for your
actions those years<br>
ago and your recent ..episode with my daughter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry gritted his teeth..he really hated giving her a victory..<br>
<br>
&quot;I will not order you to do so, an apology must come from
the heart, but you can not<br>
stay here if you do not. So please make your choice Fry.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry sighed and walked up to Tyia, and kneeled.<br>
<br>
&quot;M'lady Tyia it is with all my heart, that I ask your
forgiveness for hitting you on the<br>
head with a book&#133;and then&#133;entering your bath.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyia frowned some more and then spoke &quot;I forgive you&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good! Welcome to my rank young Fry and young Reverdone. Go
tell your families of<br>
what has happened and report to the barracks for cot assignment
and await my call.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;yes M'lord&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes M'Lord&quot; They said and they saluted him and made to
head back to Kelethin. But at<br>
the last moment fry stopped and turned back up to the Throne.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is wrong young fry?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to further make amends to the Princess for my
transgressions M'lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no need.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, but in my heart I feel I can not let this go as is.
May I sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You may.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry stood up proudly smiling and walked up to Tyia and bent over
to whisper in her ear.<br>
<br>
&quot;You may want to have a cleric take a look at that mole on
your behind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyia turned red &quot;WHY YOU!!!&quot; Fry dashed away with Tyia
in hot pursuit. &quot;COME BACK<br>
HERE !!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The King just roared with laughter.<br>
