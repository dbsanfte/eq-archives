<tr><td><font color="#C00000">The first computer game I ever really got into was Starcraft, an excellent RTS. But after a while, my normal Starcraft buddy left for some game called EverQuest. Around that time I was playing on a MUD based on Magic: the Gathering, and was playing as an Assassin (the equivalant of a Rogue).<BR><BR>
When I finally bought EQ, in August of 1999, I talked to this friend (and His friend) about what I wanted to make. To me, either Shadowknight or Rogue sounded very cool. He insisted that rogues suck because they only get skills warriors get (at the time I didn't know any better), and said how shadowknights are hated in all cities and so I wouldn't want to be one of those. I finally decided on a wizard, after being drawn in by Verant's claim of their superb damaging capabilities. (Note: at the time, this friend played a female wood elf ranger named Aluna. At the time of this writing, he has remade Aluna and is playing her again.)<BR><BR>
So I started with Zhado - a high elf wizard. Faydark seemed very big to me. He eventually got up to level 4, wearing all of the l33t cloth he'd acquired from killing orcs, when I decided I'd rather make an erudite for the int bonus they get. One day Aluna's other friend, a level 18 wood elf druid named Kulani, escorted me all the way from Faydark to Qeynos, and then transferred my cloth (and my most-coveted Cutthroat Ring) to my new erudite wizard, Kizaar.<BR><BR>
And I became accustomed to the life of a caster. Kizaar made it to level 41 in 74 days of played time, and I learned to solo well, learned the nature of all the midlevel dungeons, and became a successful and well-equipped wizard (at the time) by hunting in Lower Guk. Around that time - the beginning of May 2000, I believe - I started playing around with Triff, a level 11 half elf rogue I had laying around. I'd played him some before, but had lost a corpse of his (about 1k that I lost I think - it was a big deal to me then) and promptly quit him.<BR><BR>
Finally I purchased a lot of dex gear and some semi-decent weapons for Triff. <I>Around this time is when Triff met Aishen and fell in love with her. Triff and Kizaar both joined her guild, Ring of Destiny, which, at the time, was a very small guild.</I> He got to level 16 mainly hunting on Faydwer, and then I remade him and maxed his str stat. This time Triff got to level 21 on Faydwer, when I decided that I should've been a rogue all along.<BR><BR>
The life of a caster is frustrating. You can be soloing happily and efficiently, until suddenly "Mob resists your snare/root/fear 3 times in a row and now you're out of mana and die in 4 hits." The sad thing is that even when you're soloing perfectly, it becomes the most boring thing ever. No damn mob tells Triff that it's resisting his pierces. Triff does not die in 4 hits. And when he solos, he has fun doing it. I'm still a great damage dealer, but now life/death and fun/frustration are not on so thin a line for me.<BR><BR>
I sold everything Kizaar was wearing - SMR (traded it for the first Slime Coated Harpoon I'd ever even heard of), GE Boots (for an FBSS), Impskins, Ivandyr's Hoop, Runed Cowl, and basically everything else on him. Triff's str, unbuffed, was like 181. At the time I believed that rogues are not meant to tank, and so no matter how much AC they get, they won't ever be able to. And that rogues are meant to deal damage, and so str is the only thing that is valuable to one. This notion lasted me until about level 48 or so.<BR><BR>
I did level 21 through 35 in HighKeep - it was during summer, I had nothing else to do, and I leveled very quickly. At level 28 and on, I would solo the Lookout Room (along with the bard outside). I met a lot of nice people there, and people liked me; I was basically there all the time, up until 35.<BR><BR>
Side Notes: when I reached level 35, I spent some time trading, and became familiar with three "traders by profession" - Arryen, Rugrat, and Maniacle. All were people whom I'd talked to some in the past, but now I really learned how the trading game worked. It's also here that I went off to New Jersey for a month to visit family.<BR><BR>
When I came back, I found that Valrus had been invited into Ring of Destiny - and he had joined for Aishen. After seeing enough of the dialogue between the two, it became apparent that the whole thing was bullshit, and I left RoD. I still didn't cut off all relations with Aishen though until late September 2000. This is when I joined Method of Mischief, the guild of a newly met friend (Austrilana), <I>as well as</I> the old friend that had gotten me into EQ in the first place. To make a long story short, he got mad at me for some idiotic reason (and he was like that often), and kicked me from the guild. When MoM realized this, they got mad. The entire guild was disbanded within a couple days.<BR><BR>
I finally accepted Maniacle and Rugrat's invitations to join Lions Denizens. I should've joined them sooner.<BR><BR>
Anyway.. you have to understand that Kizaar did Lower Guk for five levels. At the time, the loot there rocked, but the zone itself was a death trap. This is what made me decide to put Triff in Solusek B instead. He did 35 to 46 in the Pool Room, and became accustomed to pulling there.<BR><BR>
When he wasn't in Sol B, Triff would be out raiding with Lions Den's signature one-group "asskicking crew". I recall doing Kaesora a lot.. and it was fun because I hadn't ever raided anything like that up until then.<BR><BR>
Triff got to level 48 in Sol B, when one day, a guildless gnome warrior named Zolmaz sent me a tell and asked if I wanted to get some great exp. This is hard to explain, and I don't have the exact dialogue immediately at hand, but the way he talked to me basically reminded me of that little French commando kid on the South Park movie.<BR><BR>
But I went along with it. I met him at the druid ring with a female half elf druid he'd brought himself: Xenedrae. She was rather quiet for the most part. Our little three-man group (levels ranging from 45-48) ran into Sol A, and Xenedrae and I followed the gnome through a long path to Sol B. He referred to the spot where we ended up zoning in as "Bat 3". One time, when Zolmaz zoned out for whatever reason, I started flirting with Xenedrae (as was my nature). She became a very close friend of mine.<BR><BR>
For a few nights, we'd go there and get exp killing bats and beetles and crawlers like that. But Zolmaz had some major control issues and a bad way of dealing with them. But if he sensed me getting pissed off (Xenedrae usually just took it), he'd immediately begin kissing my ass and reminding me that we are the bestest pals ever to walk the grounds of Norrath together. One night, it kinda blew up, and Xenedrae and I quit going to Sol B with him.<BR><BR>
At this point, I faced a decision: to join Midnight Sojourn (Erollisi Marr's second-most powerful uber guild if you didn't know), or to join Everhaven (Xenedrae's guild). I opted to join Everhaven, and to this day I don't regret it. I began to hunt with Xenedrae constantly, and have put in most of my playing time with her and our alternate chars.<BR><BR>
I could fill a lot of space talking about Xenedrae and my experiences, but I don't want to get any more long-winded than I already have - maybe I'll write something for her another time.<BR><BR>
My current state is that of a guildless trader who hunts with his favorite partner all the time. I am well-equipped, and SELF-equipped (with the exception of two pieces of Woven Shadow and a Tattered Mantle, I personally acquired all my equipment without the help of any guild.) I have five chars that have similar-leveled female counterparts (all of them hers), and I have fun with EQ. The reason I'm not in Midnight Sojourn or Magister is simply because I wouldn't commit to a guild before her. Btw, I can say that I am probably the first rogue on the server who has obtained (traded for) a Mrylokar's Breastplate without being in an uber guild and without ever having seen Trakanon. Everything has its price.</font>
