  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>Not all of what follows is necessarily restricted to level 39+ nor to the paladin class, but I have tried to focus on how a paladin can use his/her special abilities with regard to various areas.<P>
<P>

I. VISION OF A PALADIN<P>
<P>
To realize how to play a paladin well it's important to realize what a paladin is a hybrid of: a warrior and a cleric. The cleric is the most defensive-minded WIS caster in the game. Similarly the paladins are the most defensive melee class in the game. <P>
<P>
Throughout the 30's, while Ghoulbane is still king, paladins are able to hit nearly as well as the other melee classes. They are a bit short on armor, however, as many of the other classes are able to acquire a full set of quest armor long before a paladin can have much Ro armor at all. Up until the low 40's then paladins are actually one of the more offensive melee classes. That all changes as 50 approaches.<P>
<P>
I'll get into more detail on weapons below, but suffice it to say that (short of getting a Fiery Avenger) paladins will start to suffer from the lack of dual wield and high quality weapons at the highest levels. They make up for this be being better damage sponges (tanks) than many of the other melee classes. <P>
<P>
The 39+ paladin must transition from being a heavy hitter to a more defensive-minded tank. It is this mindset that I discuss in this strategy guide.<P>
<P>
<P>
II. EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS<P>
<P>
Now that the game has been out for a year the players have gotten a pretty good feel on what matter for stats. The general consensus that the only REALLY important things for melee combat are level, AC, HPs, and resists. Since there's no equipment to improve your levels I'll focus on the other three.<P>
<P>
To be a defensive tank a paladin must focus on costing his cleric the minimum amount of mana possible. This will lead to a higher kill rate, less chance of death and more experience for the party as a whole. The MOST efficient use of a cleric's mana is to be using complete heals. The view on the cleric boards is that this spell only becomes viable when the tank has at least 2000 HPs buffed. Until that point the cleric is more likely to use superior heals.<P>
<P>
So, if you don't generally have over 2k HPs buffed (and by all means, throw whatever symbol you've got on!) then you should focus on AC over HPs. Since the cleric is going to be using superior heal it won't matter how many hit points you have left when the heal hits. The cost of your damage to the group is in the total amount of damage you'll take per fight. It should be a very rare fight that the total amount of hit points comes into play if you're not using complete heal. That's too close a fight for my tastes. Throw out those serpentine bracers and wear silver plated or Vox bracers - until you can get Ro or Valorium. Get rid of those black pearl rings and go with something that has AC (jagged bands, fire opal-plat, etc.). Even if you have a good 2H weapon you might consider putting it away for your Ghoulbane just to have the extra 10 - 25 (35 for Erudites) base AC of a shield - not to mention the HP or resist modifiers that many of the shields add (up to 107 HPs at level 50 from a Bladestopper). You're not  in charge of dealing damage any more - you're in charge of preventing it.<P>
<P>
Depending on your race, equipment and presence of a shaman for buffs you should start to break the 2k HP threshold by level 44 or so. Now is the time to focus on hit points even at the expense of other stats. Fire opal-plat rings or Djarn's ring should be worn. The crested Mistmoore spaulders start to have a big impact on total number of hit points (AND have good AC). The difference between 2000 and 2100 hit points may not seem like a lot. I'll state that every little bit above 2k helps. In the end a good cleric is going to have the complete heal hit when you're at the same hit point level regardless of how many you've got total. Having more to start with allows you to soak up just that many more hits with no extra mana cost to the group.<P>
<P>
As I alluded to at the top of the guide paladins currently suffer from a dearth of good weapons in the 40's. This may change with Kunark but for now we have to live with it. There are seven weapons that a paladin in his 40's might think about using (there may be another 2H sword from Sky that has not yet seen general use). I've placed them in 4 tiers below - assuming the use of a haste item for all of the weapons but the mithril 2H sword.<P>
<P>
1. Ghoulbane<P>
2. Mithril 2H sword, Soulfire, Theologian Claymore<P>
3. Razing Sword of Skarlon, Darkmetal Holy Water Sprinkler.<P>
4. Fiery Avenger<P>
<P>
A quick peek at this list explains the current dilemma for paladins. First, we'll write off the FA as more of an anomaly than a normal weapon - at least for now. Second, the Sprinkler no longer appears to be dropping as of the time that I write this. Finally, the RSS is a rather rare drop and is NO DROP so while not impossible to obtain it's not a common weapon for paladins. So, a paladin is limited to a mithril 2H class weapon or a Ghoulbane. <P>
<P>
By the time paladins are thinking of getting a mithril 2H, the other classes are starting to dual wield Ykeshas (except the poor SKs who have their own weapons dilemma). The mithril 2H is a nice weapon and all, but it cannot stack up against the damage output of 2 Yaks. If the paladin is not the only hitter in a group it's almost better for him to break out a shield and his Ghoulbane that he's (possibly) been using since level 30 all the way through 50.<P>
<P>
After level 46 the paladins cannot hope to hold a candle to the other classes for damage. The sprinkler is a very nice weapon (for those lucky enough to get it before it stopped dropping) but that's the only really useful planar weapon for paladins. The claymore is a joke - I never see paladins using that over a mithril 2H sword unless they have an enchanter casting Swift Like the Wind on them (the mith 2H sword's haste is better than an fbss so it pays to use that sword and pick up the AC from a TBB or so). There are, currently, no known god or dragon weapons for paladins. At the same time the other melee classes have many planar, god and dragon weapons that are all far superior.<P>
<P>
This is not a complaint - this is reality. Once a paladin understands that he can't hope to compete in the dmg output arena he'll start to focus on his true strengths.<P>
<P>
<P>
III. QUESTS AND FACTION<P>
<P>
I won't put much into this section since by level 39+ most paladins are either absolutely loved or absolutely hated by almost every faction in the game. It's hard to be a paladin and remain indifferent to people. But improving factions (and hurting them with their opposites) is a necessary part of being a paladin.<P>
<P>
I would highly encourage all paladins to work on their factions with the various races. Verant toned down the amount of faction required to do the armor of Ro quests and made the items tradable (thank goodness!) but it's still necessary to have a modicum of faction to do these quests. We've already discussed the importance of AC to a 39+ paladin and Ro armor is a great place to bulk up on that. Also, the Soulfire requires pretty good faction. And now that the SF is a necessary component for the FA quest there's actually a good use for them to be put.<P>
<P>
<P>
IV. THE FUNCTION OF A PALADIN IN A GROUP<P>
<P>
This is the 'meat and potatoes' of being a paladin. We don't solo well so we may as well make ourselves more appealing to groups by playing well. A good paladin is a bit more flexible than a warrior in a group and can, as I discuss below, make a better option for damage sponge.<P>
<P>
A. Tank<P>
<P>
The most important job that most paladins do is tanking. By this I mean being the target of all the MOB's affection. By level 50 the paladin is almost always the clear choice for this job.<P>
<P>
When a group is spawn limited (as opposed to mana limited) there's a million ways to screw up and still kill everything available. I'm not interested in that case. May as well let the bards tank and the paladin play cleric since efficiency is not a concern. The Planes are another story entirely - see below. My discussion here is for the group that is looking to earn experience, understaffed holding an area and/or has no competition for its spawn (imps and guardians near Djarn e.g.). In this case the efficiency of the group is of prime importance.<P>
<P>
As I mentioned above the most efficient use of a cleric's mana is using complete heals. Once a paladin has over 2k HPs buffed he's the ideal choice for playing damage sponge. Warriors may have better armor, but give a paladin in full Valorium a Bladestopper and he's got more base AC than the warrior with full Indicolite without a shield. <P>
<P>
The trick to making the use of complete heals effective is timing it to hit the tank as close to death as possible. This is always a bit nerve wracking as a cleric learns his skill, but in the end it can be a fun game - leading to a bit more adrenaline if nothing else. Most clerics, depending on the situation, will start to cast a CH somewhere between 1 and two bubbles of life left on the tank; and the heals should always be announced so the tank knows they're coming. As a paladin you can help the cleric out a bit. The paladin is the only tank that can seriously impact the damage rate of the MOB as it beats on him. Watch your health bar as you're about to die. It's very common for a MOB to suddenly start hitting you a lot harder as you approach zero. In this case bash and cast stun! A CH takes 10 seconds to cast. Your stun will likely freeze the MOB cold for 2 seconds or so. If you're gutsy, Holy Might will freeze the MOB even longer if you know far out enough that the CH is going to be late. This can have a dramatic impact on the chances of a CH hitting something other than your corpse. With a little practice the cleric can get used to this and hold off his CH just a few seconds later - improving its efficiency. Also, a paladin always has the last resort of hitting his Lay of Hands. In theory it's possible that a paladin can use his LoH to assist any tank if the cleric gets interrupted or if the CH is late. In reality, however, all of us paladins can hit [tab] LoH [tab] VERY quickly after months of practice. It's much harder to pick the right Fkey in an emergency situation.<P>
<P>
Also consider the fact that the paladin does the least damage of all the tanks (with the possible exception of SKs who are on par with paladins melee-wise). By the 40's all the MOBs we fight know how to dodge, parry, riposte just like we do. These skills can only help the MOB if he's facing the attack though. If we assume that a MOB will avoid a set percentage of the damage he'd otherwise absorb doesn't it make sense that the paladin be the one to lose out on his damage? That way the group is losing the minimum amount of melee damage. Have the warriors, rangers, SKs, bards, monks, and of course rogues get around behind the MOB and beat upon him with no fear of being dodged, etc.<P>
<P>
You'll probably have to talk to the warriors and rangers in your group about not hitting their taunt key. It's as ingrained for them as it is for you. A number of the rangers that I play with literally move the taunt key off their front page of hot keys just to prevent hitting it by habit. They should taunt things off casters, but not off a paladin. Explain why you should be tanking for efficiency's sake. Monks are pretty used to FDing mid-fight to get MOBs off them but if they don't you might ask them to start doing so. And rogues have their new evade skill which should keep them nice and low on the hate lists. Finally ask the rangers to hold off on casting snare for a few seconds into the fight to give you a chance to get firmly established as the target.<P>
<P>
This is not to say that common sense shouldn't apply here. An erudite paladin with scarce Ro armor should probably let the ogre warrior in full crafted tank. And even though a level 40 and 50 tank might have the same AC, all tanks can tell you that the 50 tank will take less damage from a MOB simply because of his higher level (especially against anything red to the lower level tank). But for equivalently equipped, same level tanks the paladin should play sponge. <P>
<P>
Even if everyone in your group agrees that you should be tanking and takes steps to help you it's still going to be difficult to keep the MOBs on you - simply because everyone in the group is out hitting you! Fortunately MOBs REALLY hate being stunned and bashed. Use of our (up to) two stun spells, bash and taunt can very often keep  MOB on the paladin even when he's being far out hit. Damage shields are a wonderful way of helping lock the MOBs onto a paladin since the damage dealt counts towards the paladins from the hate list point of view (though counts to nobody for determining which group gets a kill). Ask your rangers to keep a good thorn shield on you. Finally, don't underestimate the value of a well-timed greater heal to help you taunt MOBs. Clerics all know that healing things is a good way to piss them off. Well, why not use that to your advantage. Heal yourself, the wizard, whoever - it doesn't matter. That 280 HPs of healing will do wonders for making things jump back onto you. It's also very good for taunting a large number of MOBs all at once.<P>
<P>
B. Puller<P>
<P>
Paladins are not necessarily the best class to be out pulling. Monks, bards, and enchanters can all play this role as well. There are times, however, when the paladin has the advantage in this area and should do this job.<P>
<P>
Paladins have lull spells that they can use. Having played a dwarven paladin all my career I can't say I've used them much - too little charisma. So, I cannot speak to their effectiveness except to say that if you're going to pull all the MOBs in a group anyway you may as well take a crack at lulling one first.<P>
<P>
Paladins want to be the one in a group tanking. This is easier to arrange if the paladin is the first one to piss off the MOB - new pulls always head for the puller (or the medding cleric!). In an places like the Lord and King areas of Lower Guk there are fixed numbers of MOBs that need to be pulled. Once they have been split up somehow (monks are great at this) then the paladin should hold the area for his group by pulling them essentially as they spawn. The monk could pull and FD but the paladins have one advantage over the monks here: casters.<P>
<P>
There is nothing a monk can do to prevent a nuking MOB from casting as soon as it's pulled. And monks generally have poor resists and lower HPs than a paladin so that nuke's going to hurt. By contrast a paladin can usually pull such beasties without ever letting them get off a cast by stun pulling. Hitting a MOB with stun prevents it from getting off that free nuke that doesn't seem to require a line of sight or range to track you down and hit you. The 2 seconds that the MOB is motionless also lets the paladin get a head start back to his group when pulling any sort of MOB. The chain stunning subsection following will discuss the uses of stun more.<P>
<P>
All good pullers should know how to regulate the MOBs arrival rate to maximize the kill rate. As long as nobody is ever full mana then no possible mediation time is wasted. It's also important to determine which player's mana is the most important: the healer's, the nuker's or the enchanter's. That will vary by group and situation and could be the topic of a whole new guide. <P>
<P>
C. Chain Stunning<P>
<P>
You will often see clerics that spend mana preventatively by stunning rather than having to spend it healing. The downside to this is that the time spent casting stuns takes away from possible meditation time and the stuns build up hatred towards the cleric. Most paladins are going to have to cast stuns just to keep MOBs on them. For those fights where the a clerics might be tempted to chain stun (typically boss MOBs who hit harder than a normal MOB) the paladin can take that role over instead. At 49 paladins get Holy Might. With bash and their two stun spells properly spaced a paladin can keep many MOBs completely motionless for about 70% of the battle. The upside is that the paladin is taking very little damage and is cementing his position at the top of the hatred list. The downside is that spending all that time casting is eating into his melee damage. But that's not big deal. As long as there are other melee types there beating on the MOB we've already decided that the paladin is not in charge of dishing out damage.<P>
<P>
Using this technique it's possible for a group consisting of nothing more than 4 paladins to kill the Ghoul Lord. It takes about 10 minutes, but it can be done.<P>
<P>
Paladins are also specialists at fighting nuking or healing MOBs. If you pull a nuker with a stun, run back to your group and get around a corner. This will force the MOB into the middle of your group to get a line of sight on you (and in melee range now) rather than having him stop further out to cast. As soon as you see the MOB show, cast stun again and interrupt it. Save the bashes and stuns and keep a close eye on the text window. When you see your victim try to cast a spell break out a stun or a bash. Since bash caps relatively low it's not unusual to miss a bash on higher level MOBs but stun usually hits. Lower level MOBs will recover from the stuns slowly enough that it's possible to cycle stun, Holy Might, and bash to prevent them from casting at all. Do the same thing too anything that's silly enough to think that it's going to heal itself while fighting you. Even against things like giants that don't seem to be frozen by stun spells being hit by a stun will still interrupt them from nuking, buffing, or healing.<P>
<P>
Many clerics are used to the idea of stunning wizards. Let them know that you're going to be doing that role instead. That way the don't waste time overwriting your stuns and are either nuking or dispelling them instead.<P>
<P>
D. Crowd Control<P>
<P>
Without a bard or an enchanter it will often fall to the paladin to take care of crowd control. Even the best pullers occasionally pull more MOBs than they intend and there's no sense in letting them deal damage for free. Park them somewhere with root!<P>
<P>
I realize that clerics, wizards, etc. all have more effective spells for parking something out of the way. Paralyzing earth can be quite impressive in fact. However, I would advocate taking on this role yourself. If things don't like to be stunned then they REALLY don't like to be rooted. Unless someone atones them while rooted they're almost guaranteed to attack the person who rooted them. Sure a wizard might be able to park them longer, but I'd much rather have something coming after the paladin in plate armor than after the wizard in his robe.<P>
<P>
If you do decide to fight multiple MOBs at once (for use with dmg shields, AE spells, whatever) just remember the 3 MOB limit. Most people interpret this to mean that one player can only have 3 MOBs hitting them, but that's not quite the case. In fact, as long as you have 3 MOBs hitting you then more MOBs will not MOVE to attack. However, as long as you remain on top of the hatred list you can position yourself within the range of 4+ MOBs and they're all perfectly happy to keep beating on you rather than on someone else.<P>
<P>
E. Manastones<P>
<P>
This section only applies only to those servers with an abundance of manastones when playing outside of the planes.<P>
<P>
We all know that a paladin's ability to greater heal caster using a manastone can help them refill their mana. I've got no objection to that and served that role for a very long time. However, paladins can make much better use of a manastone if they keep it to themselves!<P>
<P>
A paladin that's out scouting and pulling cannot spend the downtime between fights to refresh him mana. But we know that mana usage with stuns is critical for keeping MOBs on the paladin. A manastone can fix this problem. Whenever a cleric is tempted to fill the paladin's bar at the end of a fight (usually a CH) the paladin should break out his manastone and use up whatever hit points he has left before the CH hits. Those are free HPs being put to no good use otherwise. If that's not enough mana just stop and ask for another CH. My paladin  has between 2450 and 3076 HPs depending on the suite of buffs he's got on (resolution and pinzarn at the very least all the time). Since a manastone will convert at a 3:1 ratio that allows the paladin to recover between 800 and 1000 mana. Well, even on a level 50 paladin that's a good chunk of the bar if not the whole thing. All that for the cost of 400 mana (not including specialization) for the cleric - who CAN be medding while the paladin is out pulling.<P>
<P>
<P>
V. TO YAULP OR NOT TO YAULP?<P>
<P>
There's always a bit of debate as to whether the AC and strength increase from Yaulp (and Yaulp II) is worth the loss of attack. Here's my take on this topic.<P>
<P>
Whenever you cast any spell the delay clock for your weapon resets regardless of whether you were about to swing right before casting or not. Therefore it makes sense to cast yaulp only immediately after a swing. This is not so critical with a Sprinkler or a Ghoulbane as they are fast weapons. But for things like a Soulfire or a Skarlon sword it can be a major pain to have to wait a whole new cycle.<P>
<P>
If you're in a group with a lot of hitters then the lost melee is probably worth the increase in AC you get for yaulping. Since yaulp is not a terribly powerful taunt, though, you might find it's more difficult to hold the MOB on you. Therefore you might only use it when chains stunning a boss MOB or such where the extra AC will really help and you're already doing well on hatred.<P>
<P>
In situations verses dragons or against many planar MOBs AE dispels will strip all buff from everyone. In those situations I tend to use yaulp for 2 purposes. First, it puts an icon on my buff list that can get stripped off at no real cost to me (saving a real buff for one more round) and secondly it provides at least a minimal buff since I will have lost all other defensive buffs quickly.<P>
<P>
<P>
VI. PLANES<P>
<P>
The first thing to realize about the planes is that paladins are not going to able to do their jobs as defensive tanks very well there. Taunt caps too low to be of any real use against level 49+ MOBs. There's usually a TON of hitters in hitting the MOB and the MOBs tend to switch targets frequently rather than locking onto one PC. Since we've already discussed that paladins are the weaklings of dealing damage, let's discuss some other jobs that paladins can do to be of more use to the overall group.<P>
<P>
A. 'Picker'<P>
<P>
It's very common for paladins to either BE the pullers in some planes (Sky, Fear) or to work WITH the puller (all 3). There's a few reasons for this. We know that the pulled MOB is gonna be pissed at whoever pulled it - the paladin has the HPs to take a few hits safely. Paladins have that nice LoH that can be used if the MOB gets too close to them on the way back to the party. It's a good stop-gap heal to make it back to the real clerics. Paladins can be out healing monks trying to split things using FD pulling. It's better to have a tank-class PC out there than a cleric as the paladin is in much better shape if something aggroes on him. Finally the paladin can serve the job of 'picker' rather well. In Hate it's common for a monk to FD pull 2 or more MOBs near the main group. The monk then tells the paladin when it's safe to cast stun or shoot an arrow (depending on preferences) at a MOB when it's single. <P>
<P>
B. Reviver<P>
<P>
Clerics have enough demands on their mana in the planes (well, when the pull rate is high). There are a number of situations where it's necessary to use revive as a transportation capability (especially in Hate and Sky). There's no need to make the clerics use their mana to do this when the paladin's (otherwise generally useless in the planes) mana can do the same job. <P>
<P>
C. Enchanter Escort<P>
<P>
This is an idea that I came up with a while back that we've put to good use on The Rathe server. Even when there's more than enough firepower around to safely clear a plane, it's very common for enchanters to die due to resisted mesmerizations, poor /assists, or other such mishaps. A paladin working with each enchanter can cut WAY down on enchanter deaths.<P>
<P>
When multiple MOBs are incoming to the main group it is very common for the enchanter to try to pick one out at range and mez it. The upside is that people are less likely to mistarget the sleeping MOB and will focus on the correct one to kill. The downside is that the enchanter is going to be jumped hard if the MOB resists the mez.<P>
<P>
Instead, have the paladin stand away from the group and cast stun or root on the extra MOB. It'll likely fail, but so what? The MOB is now pissed at the paladin. The paladin continues to chain cast root and taunts the MOB in question while the enchanter tashanis and mesmerizes it. The paladins continues to chains cast root while it sleeps. It won't wake the beast, but it'll continue to piss it off and also prevent the MOB from running over to eat the enchanter when it DOES wake up.<P>
<P>
Finally, if there IS a problem the paladin is in range of the enchanter to fire off a LoH. There's no other heal in the game that can hit that fast.<P>
<P>
<P>
VII. HELPING (PRETENDING TO BE)CLERIC<P>
<P>
Since paladins are supposedly one quarter cleric it's of no surprise that paladins overlap clerics in many areas. My recommendation is to offload as many jobs as possible from the cleric to save them mana for important things - like healing you!<P>
<P>
If there is sufficient downtime for a paladin to meditate then use mana to top people off in the group. Cast guard on the members of the party that don't REALLY need shield of words. Naltron is not an everyday buff - pinzarn is much more common. Well, by 49 you have that buff - take charge of it. At the very least cast it on yourself to keep a higher max HP total. <P>
<P>
Don't make the cleric get up from medding to stun or root or dispel MOBs or to invis vs. undead folks. These are all things that the paladin is perfectly equipped to do (well, sometimes a multi-buff dispel is nice). Paladins cannot do everything a cleric can do so why not go ahead and do what we CAN do? Otherwise our mana and concentration is being put to no good use.<P>
<P>
Sometimes it's possible that the paladin is the healer, or more commonly, the backup healer. This is not that bad a role for us - even if we're in the middle of a fight tanking. By the mid-forties G Heal is an old enough spell that paladins have little trouble casting it even while in mid fight. Paladins have the same channeling skill as clerics but more HPs and better armor. Therefore they're actually MORE likely to get a G Heal off than a cleric under the same circumstances. <P>
<P>
If you're the one in charge of buffs it's better to spread them out in time rather than clump than to cast on everyone at once. A cleric will likely cast resolution on everyone at the same time to know when it's needed. That's fine. Paladins don't have enough mana to do that with valor and guard. Spread them out and let people know that they have to tell you when they fall. It's a small price to have to pay to have a paladin pretending to be the group's cleric.<P>
<P>
<P>
Good luck to all the paladins out there that have read this far down the guide.  Use the knowledge well and fight with honor and pride!<P>
