     As if those words seemed to be a cue, a huge explosion followed.  Magic burned the air, swirls of crimson fire seemed to cry as they reached upwards for the cool night sky.  Cries of men and gnoll’s were drowned out by the fierce rage of powerful magics.  Barks of spells were heard, and the loud clanking of running steel boots.  They had reached the Hall.<p>
     Within a few moments, all laid still.  Not a sound seemed to be heard, or the noise was once so loud that a yell seemed to be a whisper now.  Thunder sounded, but no rain, no clouds.  Portals!  Immediately Simonic stood up, his silver hair swaying as he turned to go back atop the docks.					<p>
     "Follow!", he called to the other two still beneath the docks.<p>
     Without hesitating, Dorson was on Sim’s trail, as Tiethroe leapt up from the ground and was on the chase as well. 						<p>
<center>**********************************************</center><p>
     Ebon charged the gnoll’s with his blades held at his sides, as he approached, they began to defend.  Yet, as they defended, they soon fell.  Ebon spun in tactical circles, dodging blows and slashes, only to find another one on the opposite side.  Chinks rang against his armor, but nothing even close to penetrating it.  As he swirled, he slashed the dodged blow, and was welcomed by a loud bark of death.<p>
     Among the mass of Qeynos men, he could see that the gnoll forces were just too large, and with one sword he struck the throat of one, and raised his other sword and called into the crowd, signaling another retreat.  They now had been pushed back next to the forge and small pond.  In their wake, from the front gate, was dark crimson blood, and bodies of both man and gnoll.  Which had also followed them here, as the once clear pond turned a dark red, with lifeless corpses floating about the top.<p>
     Men screamed as deafening magic was unleashed, causing some of their ears to bleed.  The Hall’s mages were utterly unskilled in combat, and only lasted for a few minor spells, as many of them thought these gnolls were of the likes from Black Burrow.  The ones that thought thus, died quickly.  Ebon cringed at the thought of his death coming from a gnoll, but the thought of them taking over his city was unthinkable.  As he moved backwards he tripped over a corpse, letting a grunt lose, he landed hard on the ground.  <p>
     Men tried to get to him, but the gnoll’s had already taken his position, and stampeded on him as any other corpse.  Quietly Ebon spoke a prayer to Nife, as his world went black.<p>
<center>**********************************************</center><p>
     Gahlith Wrannstand paced around the Magi’s chambers, looking at his companions.  Kinloc Flamepaw and Mespha Tevalian.  Both seemed to be in just as deep of thought as Gahlith was in.  Tonmerk stood there, awaiting their decision.  All three, were draped in their normal blue colored robes, and none were really ready for a high scaled battle.  <p>
     "So, priest, you say that this is our only option?" came the almost mocking voice of Mespha.<p>
     Tonmerk nodded his head in resolute agreement.<p>
     Gahlith shot a sharp look at the priest in the swirling armor.  "Do you have any idea what you have asked us to do!"<p>
     "For the city of Qeynos, you are their last hope, if you are able to do this, then the city may still survive, and standing," the request of the high priest was high, and not an easy one for the masters of the hall to accept.<p>
     Kinloc stood up from his seat, and walked over to Gahlith, "I think we could do it, honestly, I don’t think it should bring down the entire temple and won’t go into the streets."<p>
     Gahlith looked at Kinloc with fire in his eyes, but Kinloc did not sway.<p>
     "Very well, Tonmerk.  Have the troops lead them here, and we’ll do what you’ve asked.  But if this fails old man, pray to Nife that you died in the fires." growled the tall sorcerer.  <p>
     "May Nife protect", at those words, Tonmerk gave a slight bow and exited the chambers in search of Ebon or Camlend.<p>
     "He better", uttered Mespha as the priest closed the chamber doors.<p>
<center>**********************************************</center><p>
     Camlend stood a little ways behind the main fray and ordered his paladin’s.  Offering heals to those who called for them, and sending in a hard overhead slash with his great sword.  Already, they had retreated too far he thought, they were getting too far into the city, and they had to force them back out to the front.  At that thought, Ebon’s blade went up into the air signaling a retreat.  At the sound of the trumpets calling, Camlend swore.<p>
     Taking a few steps back, moving at a slower pace as the men retreated, he observed his friend the Swordmaster.  Who was being overtaken, in a moment, he saw a gnoll fall to Ebon’s blade, before the Swordmaster fell.<p>
     "Ebon!  Astaed, Enic, get Ebon!  The Swordmaster fell!" Camlend called into the direction of where his two men were.<p>
     As the men of Qeynos heard the call, they all gasped, searching madly for their fallen commander and friend.  Yet, if they were to find him, the gnolls were already where he had been standing, on top of him.  Camlend’s eyes twinkled with a light tear, but battle was no place for tears and pushed the painful thoughts into aggression.<p>  
     A Tesch Gnoll lunged at Camlend’s throat, taking a firm hold on it.  Gasping for a moment, the paladin punched the gnoll in the stomach hard, sending it into a gasping fit releasing his hold.  As it stumbled back, Camlend sent a powerful kick into it’s groin sending keeling over.  At this, Camlend brought his blade down through it’s side shoulder, sending the lifeless gnoll to the ground.  But, already another was in it’s spot sending bladed slashes at the paladin.  As he blocked the slashes he remembered that he hated battle, as he sighed before sending another gnoll to the ground.<p>
     "The battle getting to you this early Camlend?", came a ragged voice behind him, as Tonmerk came up behind the paladin.<p>
     "The battles always get to me early Tonmerk, you know that.", Camlend let his blade down to his side, but still in a position to fight if he needed.<p>
     Tonmerk observed the battle thus far and frowned, " a lot of souls are going to be visiting Nife this day."  At the sight, he said a small prayer for all those slain.  "Where’s Ebon?"<p>
     Camlend’s shoulders slackened a little at the reminder, however a small gesture, Tonmerk understood.  As Camlend could hear another prayer uttered to his god. <p> 
     "Camlend, you need to call the final retreat into the Hall of Sorcery, I just left there and they have preparations for a good stand.  From the way things are looking, I believe they want to visit our Hall, perhaps if we fail to defend, they will take what they want and leave us alone.  Yes, I know it’s a small hope, but in Nife’s name we haven’t any more choices."<p>
     The paladin sent another slash across the chest of a gnoll, pretending to not hear the priest. Yet, before he called a retreat, he got stabbed in his arm piercing through his armor.  Blood began to leak out of the holy plated armor he wore.  Cursing slightly, he called for retreat and backed up slowly.<p>
     "Where’s that mage you and Ebon were talking about?"  The paladin called over his shoulder to the priest.<p>
     "Away.  I never asked him to stay, but perhaps he’s here -- somewhere," at those words, a concerned look went over the High Priest of Nife’s face, "yes, he’s somewhere."<p>
<center>**********************************************</center><p>
     The Qeynos guard, was hardly standing by the time they reached the Hall.  Those that were there, were soaked in blood and sweat.  Their muscles on the verge of locking and quitting altogether.  Camlend and Tonmerk were constantly casting spells which sent one’s body on an invigorating rush, helping sore muscles, but soon that didn’t even seem to help.<p>
     As they reached the doors of the hall, they continued past it, to back themselves into the wall.  The gnolls followed.  As the Guard started to step back, Tonmerk began to recite a spell, and within moments, everyone in the area began to glow, but all were too tired to even notice the change in their colors.<p>
     After the spell took effect, a dark ominous incantation floated into the air.  Camlend looked for the source, and found Gahlith atop the Hall.  His hands moving in intricate gestures, calling forth powers from the arcane he couldn’t even image what would require such a powerful man to call.<p>
     As the incantation continued, a gnoll appeared.  It wore a dark robe with red streaks lining it, his paws began to roll in circles, as a nail scratched his own self, drawing blood.  Snarls of an spell began to growl out of his mouth.  Above the Hall, swirls of crackling magic began to sway, their tongues whipping out and touching the top of the Hall, sending large stones down at the crowd below.  As the moments went by, the gnoll continued to cast his spell, as the wizard was still finishing his own.  The gnoll’s finished first.<p>
      Gahlith’s body wracked, yet he continued to finish his spell.  Pain creased his face, as large swells began to bulge beneath his skin, a few popped releasing steam into the night air.  His blood was boiling within his skin.  The gnoll frowned as the wizard’s spell was still being cast, but slowly a cruel grin spread across it’s dark purple lips.  The wizard was faltering.<p>
     Immediately Gahlith gave one last cry, finishing his spell, yet he was not there to direct it’s flow any longer as he fell off the top of the Hall.  The dark swirling mass of energy above the Hall swirled for a moment, before it exploded into an awesome sight.  Instead of falling down, in a controlled manner, it erupted, sending a blinding flash to all within range.  Magical sparks bolted across the area, hitting men and gnoll’s alike, cutting through their skin and out the other.  Cries were drowned out by a high arcane spell out of control. <p> 
     The sky still boiled with rage, as it’s magical death continued to fall.  The magic resistance Tonmerk had granted the men before the spell had been cast, did little against a spell of this proportion uncontrolled.  Even the high priest sought cover from the maddening sky above.  The gnoll that had cast the spell before, barked a command.  Again, another gnoll stepped out of thin air, and began casting a spell which removed magic.<p>
     As the spell finished, it leapt into the air, hitting the wizard’s spell.  Upon contact, the entire area exploded into falling fire.  The roof of the Hall was incinerated under the extreme heat and power, men gave mute cries before they too followed suit.  Even the gnoll’s tried to retreat but most failed, ending in a fiery blaze of fur.  Yet, the priest, was not seen.<p>
     As the spell above faded, and returned to the normal night sky gnoll’s in robes faded into being around the two other fallen gnoll casters.<p>
     "Fools!", growled one of the gnolls, this one draped in a dark purple robe.<p>
     "Well, Xshrat, they got what they wanted.  Perhaps, you should have sacrificed your life for our cause?" A darkly draped gnoll called to his comrade as he walked over and gave the corpses a kick to make sure their death was true.<p>
     "I’m sorry Shrok, but only true dog’s do such a thing," Xshrat barked in disgust.<p>
     At that, Shrok threw up a hand and spoke a word.  Xshrat keeled over and clutched himself, gasping for air that would not come.  "Well, those ‘dogs’ were better than anything you will ever become Xshrat, now as I’m in charge during our master’s absence, I expect you to stay in line and do what the mission calls for."<p>
     Shrok turned around and looked at the four other’s draped in robes, and shot them glances that demanded the same.  All the others had enough sense to obey and keep their jaws closed.  Content with their glances, Shrok turned around and walked into the Hall.  Fires still burned as the entire roof had collapsed, and large chunks of debris littered the floor.  His eyes searched over various sections of the Hall, and seemingly frowned.  No one was here, and for those that were, they were either dead or knocked out underneath the large fallen stones.<p>
     "Now, Malok said they would have scrolls within the main chambers," Shrok said to no one in particular as he eyed two large glowing doors, "and I assume, those are them."<p>
     Walking over to the doors, he withdrew a small rod from his side pouch, and hit it on the door, sending it into a magical shatter.  The glowing about the doors cascaded down to the ground.  Pushing the doors open, he stepped inside.  For the most part, the room had stayed intact, but a few large chunks had fallen and one hit a female as she laid unconscious upon the table here, with a trickle of blood escaping her head.  In another chair, sat a man in blue robes.  He didn’t take the bother in summoning the elements to aid him, for he knew it would do him no good.<p>
     "Well, human, tell me where your scrolls to the Toxxulia Forest are."  Shrok’s voiced growled in it’s native language, as he eyed the man.<p>
     The man pointed over to a small cabinet drawer alongside the wall.  Shrok’s eyes followed the direction, and eyed the cabinet.<p>
     "Open it, human."<p>
     The man stood from his seat and walked over to the cabinet and opened the drawer up, inside laid two scrolls.  The mage lifted one up and handed it to the gnoll.  In reply, the gnoll shook his huge head.<p>
     "You’re casting it, human."<p>
     A flushed look went over the mage, as he began to unravel the scroll.  As he looked over the symbols he began to speak them.  When he was done, his skin hardened as a plated look coated his body.  He still held the scroll in his hands.  The gnoll back handed him, causing the mage to bleed from his mouth.<p>
     "Do not take me for a fool mage, cast the scroll or you’ll die."  Shrok’s voice sounded even more sinister as it growled out.<p>
     "You’ll kill me anyway" protested the man, in the gnoll’s language, even though it sounded incorrect, Shrok understood.<p>
     "I’m hoping what you cast will do it for me, now cast!" Again, a paw wiped across the mage’s face.<p>
     The sighed as he looked at the five other gnolls in the chambers, and began to read the symbols on the scroll, his voice quivering.  Slowly, the scroll crumpled, and swirling mass of cold ice entombed his figure, before it tipped over to the side and laid down with the man inside.  Shrok cackled with joy at the sight, and lifted the other scroll from the drawer. <p> 
     "Xshrat, now it’s your turn.  This should be the gate, but just to be on the safe side I think you’re life needs to be risked at least once in this mission," Shrok walked over and handed the scroll the Xshrat, who nervously took it into his paws.<p>
     From the front of the Hall, a gnoll called in, "Commander Shrok, the rest of our forces are waiting outside, the ones left from the hills!"<p>
     Shrok grinned, and motioned for the rest of them to follow out into the streets once again.  Outside, stood another two to three hundred more gnolls.  Some, were even risen from the dead, as they were now corpses.  Giving his thin purple lips a smile, Shrok motioned for Xshrat to recite the scroll.<p>
     Xshrat began to read the symbols, slowly, making sure not to make a mistake and hope he too did not end up entombed in ice, or incinerated by fire.  Yet, as he growled out the symbols, thunder roared.  As the scroll crumpled into nothing, a large portal opened before him as howls and cheerful barks followed.  Shrok patted the Xshrat on his back, who nervously jumped at the touch, still worried for his coming death from the spell.<p>
     "To Paineel!", cried Shrok as he began to point towards the portal, allowing the first few gnolls to step inside.<p>  
     Soon, all but a few gnolls were through the portal.  The ones left on the Qeynos side, were to guard the area from any trespassers.  Yet, those few that had remained, found a quick death as various quick thrown daggers found their marks precisely.  From out of the shadows, a small halfling stepped onto a fallen brick and glanced up at the large portal, before he too leaped inside. <p>

<b>Chapter Six</b><br><i>A Forest. Necromancers. A Lich</i></center><p>
Simonic’s pace had slowed down to a walk, as they entered the bloody mess of corpses and debris before the pond and bank.  Tiethroe examined the area, and immediately squealed as he saw the form of his master on the ground.  Before either Simonic or Dorson could say anything, the half elf was already in the direction of his fallen master.   Simonic followed in his footsteps, with Dorson trailing behind him, who was still awe struck by the sheer amount of blood and carnage.<p>
