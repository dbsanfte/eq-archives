	<p>Yakov awoke with a start. He looked at his cousin automatically. She seemed ok, but sleep hadn’t the power to take away all the traces of dreadful wounds. He sighed. He could recognize a serious wound when he saw it. It was imperative that he get his cousin to Kelethin and the Healers as soon as possible. Otherwise he’d see her waste away and die. He tapped her, motioned for the door, and they crept out without waking the innkeeper.</p>

	
	<p>A couple of hours later, Yakov materialized with his cousin at the Spires of Greater Faydark. He tapped all the parts of his body to make sure they were still there. Teleportation was not his favorite way to travel. It made him sick and he worried he’d lose an arm or a leg. Prohibitive though the fees may be, they weren’t that bad this time. Everything seemed to be still there, so he relaxed. He grimaced. Jesica was about to swoon. He looked at the wizard who’d done the job. “Thanks. I owe you my cousin’s life.”</p>

	<p>“You were lucky. I don’t usually hang around the common lands.” The wizard looked at Jesica. 
“Her time’s almost up.” he whispered. “Get her to Kelethin <b>now.</b> Or she won’t live to see the sun go down.”</p>

	<p>“I know. Thank you.” Yakov grabbed Jesica, lifted her over his shoulder, and took off at a dead run. He was panicked, so he actually left the path and ran like hell. Terror lent speed to his steps. He soon saw the city rising up out of the forest like heaven itself. He was obviously worried. He slammed the button down and screamed for a healer. After what seemed like an eternity, one actually appeared and Yakov was told firmly he was not needed. He walked, drained, to his home, where he drank into sleep,  the first real sleep in a month at least.</p>

	<p>He awoke to a sound of pounding on the door.  He groggily stared at his door. “Who calls?”
He immediately regretted even using enough energy to talk. His head burned. He swore.</p>

	<p>“Tch tch. Such language.” It was a familiar voice. </p>

	<p>“....go away!”</p>

	<p>“What? Had too much wine?” and with that the door was kicked open. Yakov winced as the light flooded his eyes. He let the unseen speaker know exactly what he thought of him. It wasn’t very complimentary, but it sure was colorful. It was also highly inappropriate. </p>

	<p>“You’re the same as ever.” The speaker was approximately the same age. He grinned.</p>

	<p>“I have one mother of a hangover, coupled with a fever. You chose a bad time to renew an acquaintance.” Yakov sighed and picked himself off the bed. He drank an awful potion made especially for his case, looked up, and shuddered as the nasty stuff took effect.</p>

	<p>“Yes. You drink too much, Yakov.”  Dirk looked at his friend with a sympathetic eye. It was a complete falsehood, they both knew. Both the sympathy and the drinking.</p>

	<p>“Me? Whatever about you?” He looked up at his old buddy with a highly uncomplimentary eye. Dirk was known as the Black Elf. His skin was pale, but somewhat dusky, and his eyes were black, as was his hair. He was an elf, yes, but it was which  kind of elf he was  that got him into trouble. He was half dark elf and half high elf, and that was the least of his troubles. To make it worse, he’d chosen to become a Paladin, but there was nobody willing to instruct him. So he’d taught himself it, going to the goody-goodies in Felwithe to refine his skills once they were sure he was an ok guy. The Teir'dal, as could be imagined, were not too happy about a high-dark-elf being a paladin. Neither was anyone else, for that matter. So Dirk had to deal with prejudice, annoyance, and the most extreme, Teir’dal assassins every now and then. Of course, he didn’t care.</p>

	<p>“What do you want?”</p>

	<p>“First, my friend, I’m here to tell you that the Healers managed to fix your cousin up. I sure would have liked to have been working on her,” the paladin said with a lewd look.</p>

	<p>“In more ways than one, I assume.”</p>

	<p>“Yes. Second, I thought I’d want to stop by and have some fun with you.”</p>

	<p>“Fun?”</p>

	<p>“Drinks, duels, babes, food, the lot.”</p>

	<p>“Uh huh. I thought Paladins took a vow of chastity, sternness, and general lack of fun.”</p>

	<p>“Tunare forbid that!” Dirk burst out laughing, Yakov joining him. He’d missed his old friend. It went a long way towards easing the chill in his soul. </p>
	
	<p>“Especially the chastity part. You pay, we play, right?”</p>

	<p>“Of course! I’m the host, so I pay the bills.” Dirk was definitely happy about the chastity part. He was infamous for his charm and womanizing talents. Notorious, in fact. Men screamed with envy at the triumphs he had, but he didn’t ever keep a steady girl.</p>

	<p>“What more could any man want?” And with that Yakov and Dirk left Yakov’s house and wandered into the delights of Kelethin.</p>

	<p>The bar was full as it got. Inside it was warm despite the chill winter morning. Men and women alike stood inside, chatting and drinking. A game of Shifter was going on at one of the tables. A bard stood there playing his lute softly. But the music wasn’t being listened to. Yakov cursed softly under his breath as the hand was dealt. He had not been dealt a good hand. He decided to wait.</p>

	<p>Shifter was like the human game of Blackjack. However, magical cards were used that literally changed the game around. Some of them might literally change before your eyes. Others might explode as you put them down. Each deck was different, so there was no way that one could guess the affect of any given card. In addition, a round lasted until only one survivor was left. He had a five he didn’t trust, a seven, and a nine. He laid down the five first. It shimmered and became a two. Great.</p>

	<p>Dirk grinned and laid down his card. A six. As he dropped it, it slipped through the table and disappeared. Dirk looked annoyed, and everyone burst out laughing. “Stupid card.” he muttered.</p>

	<p>One of the two others at the table laid down her card. It exploded in the attractive wood elf’s face. She grimaced and wiped off the dust. “Busted, boys. Now, will somebody buy the poor loser a drink before she passes out?”</p>

	<p>“Sure. Drown your  sorrows in mead, and drown your wallet in this.” Yakov motioned to the bartender for more mead. “Ante up, boys.”</p>

	<p>The last, a red-bearded dwarf, placed his money in the pot and placed down his card. A shimmering image rose from it of a laughing mask and all the other cards on the table flipped over. “A joker, people. Pay up!” </p>

		<p>Groans. Yakov and Dirk grudgingly surrendered their wallets. The dwarf took five platinum coins from the wallets and gave them back.</p>

	<p>“Well, guys, it seems that Torbandel has won. Play again, or do you feel like some exercise?” Yakov asked.</p>

	<p>“I’m out of cash.” Dirk said with a sad look.</p>

	<p>“Me too.”</p>

	<p>“ I’m all for some exercise,”  Torbandel the dwarf said.</p>

	<p>“All right.” Dirk grinned. “Just don’t break too many bones, alright?”</p>



	<p>Fiery tendrils licked at Yakov’s leg as he tried to dodge. It didn’t work. He hissed as the fire burned his limbs. It wasn’t serious, but it hurt. He looked up again. The druid was laughing. “Oh, you’ll pay for that!” Yakov drew out his bow. </p>

	 <p>Yakov fired. He wasn’t a great shot, but he hit the druid and knocked him head over heels. When he looked down again, the druid was wincing as he got to his feet. But Yakov had had enough. He shouted and punched the druid in the face. The druid went down. Yakov pointed his sword at his foe’s throat. “Yield?”</p>

	<p>“Damn....yes.” The druid looked highly sheepish. He winced as his chest hurt. “That was a good shot.”</p>

	<p>“Not really. I’m not a good archer.” Yakov looked embarrassed. </p>

	<p>“You’re good enough.”</p>

	<p>Yakov accepted the compliment without a reply. He and his foe shook hands and the druid left the training arena. “You mystify me, cousin. I still don’t like you, but you’ve....changed. You’re not bloodthirsty anymore, but you’re not a coward either.”</p>

	<p>Yakov looked at his younger cousin with a grin. “It’s called ‘growing up’, Jes.” He laughed. “Wanna go at it?”</p>

	<p>The girl shook her head. “Dirk wanted to.” She seemed to have recovered, and she held her daggers steadily, but a slight tightness in her eyes betrayed her pain.</p>

	<p>“Nobody would think  you’d not grown up yet, Jes.” Dirk leered at the rogue, who blushed. “So, Yak, you want a fight, huh........I’ll give you one. Come on!” The Black Elf drew out his huge two-handed sword. It was made of a nearly black metal, with a thin blade, but it was big and heavy. He laughed and threw off the cloak he wore. Underneath he wore fine plate, dyed black like all his equipment. One would rather believe he was a shadowknight then a paladin. He leapt forward and into the ring.</p>

	<p>“Stop talking and start fighting!” Yakov parried the first stroke with ease. The second, however, was a feint, and as he tried to block it, the sword cut him likely. Clumsy. With moves like that I deserve to lose. </p>

	<p>But he wasn’t done yet. He yelled and kicked Dirk in the crotch. The paladin doubled over, and that was all the time Yakov needed to point his sword forward and into position. He laughed. “Dirk, you’re getting clumsy. You want to have children? At this rate, you won‘t.“ Yakov grinned and pointed his sword at Dirk’s groin.</p>

	<p>Dirk stared at the sword. Then, his eyes lowered and he began to whistle a happy tune. He ducked as the sword was swung near his neck. “Lets find out!” The paladin leapt with astounding speed onto a roof and said “Come up here!”  Yakov jumped up with ease. Their duel took them across the rooftops, but both warriors were prepared. Their eyes met. </p>

	<p><i>Let’s give the young ones a show.</i></p>

	<p><i>Gladly.</i></p>

	<p>Yakov grinned and focused his soul inside himself. I’ll give em a show, all right! He laughed and drew the sword out. No need for fatal energy for a lightshow. He knew this’d be fun. He raised the sword and summoned a weak electrical charge. It struck the Paladin and he grunted, but responded with a stroke and a striking spell. The ranger nearly flew off Kelethin. Sh-. He grabbed the deck and flipped back up. The two returned to the ground and dueled until he heard a scream. Wha?</p>


	<p>The Black Elf looked up at the scream. Dirk’s mind became all business at what he saw. He saw a single, black winged shape. Terror struck the young Paladin. It was a Hell Rider. A rider from Neriak, on a foul Drake. It happened, and they were very powerful. What does he want? Another assassin?
The Black Elf shouted “Who are you and why have you come here? Leave the others alone!”</p>

	<p>The Hell Rider replied “ Names don’t matter! Who dares stand in Innoruuk’s way?”</p>

	<p>The Black Elf raised the sword he carried. “I will!” </p>

	<p>Yakov raced forward. “This is my fight, Dirk!”</p>

	<p>Dirk gave his friend a look that said, you’re needed elsewhere. Run, this won’t be pretty.
He then turned to face the silent rider. “Shall we get started? Draw your sword, if you be mortal!” The last thing Yakov saw of the fight before he ran was Dirk raising his hand, glowing red with holy power. </p>

	<p>Yakov raced to the bridge down to the main section, following his cousin and friends. What he saw was shocking. Indigo Brotherhood warriors were fighting with the defenders. Blood stained the wooden floors red, and many were dying on both sides.</p>

	<p>“Pretty, isn’t it....Something only we can appreciate... It‘s a pity you can‘t see the beauty of that scene.”</p>

	<p>Yakov turned. A single warrior faced him. She wore steel, dyed red, and carried a heavy two-handed sword made of some dark red metal.  The ramp was otherwise empty. But the female’s sword dripped with red fluid, and there was a red smear near the woman’s mouth. His stomach turned. <i>No...! You....murdering....b-!</i></p>

	<p>“Beauty? Leave these people alone! Why do you want em dead?” He looked at her with contempt.</p>

	<p>“Does it matter? It is our purpose! The gods willed it!” The speaker was obviously a shadowknight. Scum. But scum that were easy to kill... She wiped off her mouth. And placed her blade in a ready position. “Surrender, and perhaps I shall spare your life. Lord Innoruuk's priests will deal with you heathens.”</p>

	<p>“Well, then, damn your gods! This is all the authority I need!” And with that Yakov drew his electrum-steel sword. It was forged in long-sword-style, but it was a much more powerful weapon then it appeared. Sapphire graced it’s edges. “I won‘t let you hurt these people. <i>You give up, and maybe I‘ll let you live.</i>”</p>

	<p>The warrior didn’t reply, but she rushed at him, obviously trying to cut off his head in one stroke. It was rather clumsy, and Yakov parried easily. “Ha! Is that the best you have?” The warrior screamed something in dark elvish and ran at him, kicking him in the chest, or trying to. He grabbed her foot and flipped her over. She crashed to the ground. Yakov raised his sword, but he suddenly realized he wouldn’t hit a helpless foe.  She cursed, and climbed to her feet.</p>

	<p>“Do you actually fight, or just parry?” Yakov grinned annoyingly at her and slashed at her. She hissed as the blade cut lightly into her.</p>

	<p>“Does that answer your question?! You’re not good enough for me! Get some true skill! Whoever taught you is a fool.” Yakov laughed chillingly.</p>

	<p>“Oh?” she replied and cut at his shoulder, tackling him at the same time. He refused to give her the satisfaction of acknowledging pain, and hurled her off and nearly off the ramp. Then he leapt up and pressed her hard, swinging blows very, very quickly. Soon she was gasping and bleeding, a dark blood which did not mask the lighter stains on her face. His eyes brightened, and he began to grin evilly as electricity flooded them.</p>


	<p>Xedri Nightshade’s mind filled with panic. Her foe was good, no question about that. And she hadn’t the energy to channel pain to him. She resigned herself to death, but she was terrified what the wood elves would do to her soul. Keep her from ever departing? She’d heard such awful stories..... But there was no time for panic. She had to sell herself dearly.  She blocked first one hit, then another. He raised his sword for a sweeping blow. She raised her own to parry it, but he cut at her calves. She screamed as it damaged the muscle. She toppled to the ground, tried to rise up, and met a sudden lightning bolt. Her limbs splayed out, she crashed down again and began to sob in pain and terror.
Her mind was whirling. She gasped for air. Terror. She stared into those scary, electricity-charged eyes and saw no pity. No more then she had had for the battling elves. The wood elf laughed again. “Well, now it’s your turn. Say hello to the citizens of Kelethin and your victims in heaven, that is, if you see them.”</p>

	<p>She tried desperately to calm her mind. But all she could think of was I’m going to die! Never see my friends again! Dead! And these people will torture me! Dead! It was funny how she could want pity when she hadn’t given any. Sad...She thought of her life. What am I? What have I done? What made me worthy of living? How....can I make up for it? The wood elven blood on her face mocked her own darker blood, and suddenly she felt revulsion, wanting to throw up the blood which she defiled. It was worth more then she was! More holy, more worthy of existence! So she thought.</p>

	<p>But there was no time to choose the right path. She watched, sadly and resigned, as the wood elf lifted his sword and swung it down, down. Inch by inch, centimeter by centimeter, it descended. She prepared herself for the agony of her head leaving her body, and shut her eyes. Her mind screamed in fear,
and it burst out of her mouth. </p>

	<p>As she heard the sound of blade striking, with a bell-like sound, she was puzzled. A person died when their head left their body. So why could she hear? Her eyes snapped open. The sword was hitting her own, which shattered.....The @##%$% was toying with her! He knelt down, next to her face.</p>

	<p>“When your friends withdraw, run to them. Until then, act dead.”</p>

	<p>“This....isn’t.....finished.....you.....b-.....” She could barely talk.</p>

	<p>“I know. For now, though, it is. Learn to fight for real.” And the wood elf’s crackling eyes lowered and he walked away. Xedri crawled desperately over to the drake waiting for her, and managed to sit up in the saddle without killing herself. She slapped its flanks, said “Neriak...” and passed out, lying over the saddle as the drake carefully lifted her into the sky.</p>



	<p>Like a shark’s eye, Dirk’s eyes had been called. They certainly were at that moment, as the Black Elf raised his hand. Holy power surrounded it, and he watched as the drake rider tried another flyby. His spell flashed down, away from the rider.</p>

	<p>However, it landed right on target, as it smashed into the boards below. The shockwave blasted him into the air, and he dealt the drake a huge blow, severing head from body. It collapsed to the ground without a sound. “Ha ha ha! Good one, Black Elf!” the rider said as he rose out of the wreck. “Now, let’s see.....can a miserable half-breed, loathed by all, best a true dark elf?”</p>

	<p>“Easily!” Dirk lunged, swinging a stroke meant to cripple the dark elf’s arm. The elf parried. His hand glowed black, and a dark bolt struck the paladin. Dirk’s vision darkened, but not from the spell. His eyes turned less emotional. The Black Elf grimaced. No...not now. Not in Kelethin! He responded with a beam of light which sliced into it’s target like a rapier.</p>

	<p>The two traded blows, smashing their heavy weapons down and up. As the Black Elf took damage, his mind darkened. His mind recalled, unbidden, the tricks his mother had shown him back in the dank city of Neriak... The last blow struck his back as the rider‘s skeleton pet asserted itself. Panic rushed through him, as the evil knight raised his sword for a sweeping blow. I will NOT die here!
One side of his mind screamed No! The other was focusing itself in dark ways.</p>

	<p>And, as the dark knight looked at the knocked down paladin, he suddenly felt very afraid. The Black Elf’s eyes, normally black, glowed a dark purplish blue. He registered that a fatal error had been made. A low-pitched howl began to fill the air as it darkened.</p>

	<p>“<i>Hear that?  That is the sound of Death. Amateur. Now, give my regards to Death when you see him.</i>” the Black Elf said. He laughed, cruelly, and raised his hand as it filled with a ball of black energy....Dirk’s mind went blank as he glared at the doomed man.</p>

	<p>The forest of Greater Faydark, loud with noise of battle, suddenly grew very quiet, and everything, fighter or animal, froze. Darkness descended, barred only by beams of dark blue light gracing a single, high platform. A terrible shriek resounded through the forest, as a black ray ran down the conduits the blue beams made, combined with them, and slammed into the platform with a huge dark flash, blinding all the combatants...As the light returned, everything was still.......</p>
