<p>--------------------------<br>
Ch.3 Cone-head and the War of Heroes<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Fry's luck always had a way of turning bad, here he was stuck in
the middle of Everfrost<br>
in the freezing cold and snow. Trudging up and down this stupid
mountain for that<br>
cone-headed Al'kabor&#133;..how did he get into messes like this?
He comes for one little<br>
itty-bitty clue about Pop and Kaiyan'wang and now he is stuck
playing housemaid for<br>
that stupid cone-head!<br>
<br>
&quot;Quit Lolly gagging!! Come here and start cleaning and put
those beakers away boy!!!&quot; A<br>
loud gruff voice called from inside the nice warm cave.<br>
<br>
&#133;..I'll show you where you can stick those beakers&#133;.sigh&#133;.how
did this happen?..<br>
<br>
-------------------------<br>
Several days have passed since the attack at the Scouts Gilding.
Fry's father Augustas<br>
disappeared during the panic and hysteria after the magical bolt
intended for Princess<br>
Tyia struck down Fry. Luckily though he suffered multiple
injuries, mostly burns and a<br>
broken arm, Fry survived the intense attack, but needless to say
the effects of being<br>
blasted by your own father went on further then a few scratches.
No one was<br>
unchanged by the radical events that happened, old memories were
reawakened, minds<br>
were set to wonder about this mysterious Kaiyan'wang, and old
impressions were<br>
shattered forever.<br>
<br>
Fry lay in deep sleep in the soft bed inside Felwithe, the
clerics had been paying extra<br>
attention to this young scout, mainly out of pride for this young
achiever, and also from<br>
orders. Though the King's orders would supersede, being that that
the orders where on<br>
paper the same, it wouldn't really matter. But it was the
heartfelt plea of Tyia of all<br>
people, the encouraged the clerics to put in the extra time and
mana into healing this<br>
young boy.<br>
<br>
Though she did not want to upset his wounds, she held onto him as
he slept and wept<br>
silently for him. He could have died, that spell meant for her,
could have killed him. She<br>
had been so mean to him ever since she first met him and still he
jumped in front of the<br>
spell meant for her. Why? Why did he care so much for her after
all that?<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh..Fry&#133;please wake up&#133;.&quot; She sniffed again
and held him a little tighter.<br>
<br>
&quot;&#133;.ow&#133;&quot; He moaned meekly<br>
<br>
&quot;FRY!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;&#133;..I'm up mom&#133;I'm coming&#133;for breakfast&#133;.&quot;<br>
<br>
She giggled happily as tears of joy began to flow, he was finally
awake., groggy and a<br>
little delirious but awake<br>
<br>
&quot;Fry!&quot; <br>
<br>
This time his eyes open up slightly and turned to the sound of
her voice. &quot;&#133;..Tyia?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fry&#133;you stupid lunkhead! Who told you to go jumping at
fire balls?&quot; she said smiling no<br>
venom in her voice.<br>
<br>
He smiled &quot;If that's the case&#133;. you can have &#133;the
next one..ouch&#133;.where am I?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The cleric hall in Felwithe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where&#133;is Rev&#133;and Pop?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't know where your Father went, in the confusion
after &#133;you went down, he<br>
vanished. Rev went charging after him, heh.. she just became a
Chroito and already she<br>
is ordering around the enlisted men. She ordered some supplies
and a half dozen men<br>
and left in hot pursuit, she hasn't reported back yet, but it has
only been 3 days.&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
Guess who? Yep, it is me again. I am here to give you a bit of
information once<br>
again&#133;you know with all these interruptions, I et you are
just dying to figure who I am.<br>
Hehe&#133;well you will just have to wait many more chapters
before you figure out who<br>
Fry's wife is. Hehehe. But any way, back to the info.<br>
<br>
You see, though Chroito's are technically officers in the
Felwithe army, they don't really<br>
have any power of command. A Chroito first class, is&#133;hmm..whats
the Qeynos<br>
comparison&#133;o yeah! A Third Lieutenant, it's essentially as
low as you can go in ranks<br>
and still be an officer, but like I already said, a third
lieutenant can not command unless<br>
her seniors fall in battle, but that is a rare scenario, the rank
just ensures that they are<br>
in the line of command.<br>
<br>
Well, to make a long drab boring twisted, really mixed up
military thing short, Rev legally,<br>
could not and should not have taken out those warriors&#133;which
just goes to show how<br>
dumb and gullible warriors are.<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
Fry began to sit up and prepare to go after Rev, but a flash of
pain and Tyia's protests<br>
kept him down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fry, it is too soon, you are still recovering; you took a
bad blow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have to go after Rev and find Pop&#133;I need to know why
he is doing this!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, but you are still too weak right now, please Fry.
Stay in bed get some more<br>
rest&#133;I don't know what I would do&#133;&#133;if you got hurt
again..&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry stared wide-eyed at Tyia, then smiled. &quot;You like me, You
got a crush on me&quot; he<br>
teased in a sing-song voice<br>
<br>
Tyia flushed beet red &quot;I do not!, I just..umm&#133;..Father
will need you later on that's all.&quot;<br>
And before she could get anymore embarrassed or red in the face
she zipped out of the<br>
room.<br>
<br>
Fry smiled some more, but the smile faded as his mind wandered
back to the events at<br>
hand. Bracing himself he got out of bed, and looked for some
clothes, he had made up<br>
his mind, he was going after Pop, but fate or at least clerics
who knows, determined<br>
that an uppity brave man&#133;&#133;.boy of action like himself
might do something like that, and<br>
thus could not find any clothing. He grumbled a bit, and then
thought about his<br>
predicament&#133;if he was a cleric, where would he hide the
clothing? The Cleric<br>
Guildmaster's room&#133;or the washroom, if they still weren't
clean.<br>
<br>
So without another thought, he dashed off &#133;..and promptly
created quite a ruckus as<br>
one would expect a naked elf running through the halls of a
prestigious castle&#133;.oh well.<br>
All in all it was an ego wise, a painless run, aside from a few
gasps and a couple of wolf<br>
whistles which made him flush.<br>
<br>
A few minutes later, Fry was back in his uniform, his left arm in
a impromptu sling and he<br>
was now donning a new Scout's cloak, that had been set aside for
him, when he was<br>
supposed to get out of bed. At that moment, one of castle
clerics, found him and<br>
presided to chastise him for getting up so soon, but because of
orders from King Tearis,<br>
she couldn't force him back to bed for rest, quite the contrary,
he was to report to the<br>
King immediately.<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
Fry found the King in the War room, sitting at the large table,
studying the amulet Fry<br>
had recovered on his mission&#133;.or so he thought. When he
moved closer to the King he<br>
noticed that the Amulet the King was holding was of a different
design, not vastly<br>
different, but just enough and still bore that strange symbol,
believed to be the mark of<br>
Kaiyan'wang.<br>
<br>
&quot;You sent for me M'Lord?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, Fry good to see you up so soon.&quot; The King said in
a cheery voice, but he soon<br>
went back to looking at the amulet with a face of grimness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir? &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;&#133;.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry stood still being patient.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please sit Fry, and tell me what do you know about the War
of Heros?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It was a war that took place about 8 years ago, between
light and Darkness. The might<br>
of the United Kingdoms of Faydwer and the Coalition of Neriak,
that culminated in the<br>
final showdown that has perverted the laws of nature, Bloody
Kithicor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, a good telling of what was taught in school and what I
allowed to be told to the<br>
public.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did your mother ever tell you about her role in the War of
Heros, or more specifically<br>
the events of Bloody Kithicor and the subsequent battles?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No , aside from that she served with the Unity during it,
but then who didn't in some<br>
form?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, that's true, but what you don't know is that, she
helped reduce the damage<br>
caused by Lans T'val and curbed the perverting influence, so did
your father. They<br>
where both instrumental in Bloody Kithicor and the Battle of
Lavastorm.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry was stunned, his mother? His father? Both standing side by
side with the King during<br>
Bloody Kithicor..he knew that his mother was one of the best
Scouts of Faydwer, but he<br>
had no idea that she was that good!&#133;.but wait, what was that
about a Battle of<br>
Lavastorm? He had never heard of such battle&#133;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Battle of Lavastorm?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, that was the true ending to the War of Heros, though
it was not a very good one<br>
and was why I never allowed it to be public knowledge, but before
I tell you more about<br>
that. What do you know about your father Fry?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Almost nothing Sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know what guild he served?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm. I guess she did not want you know, not that I blame
her, nearly all of the druids<br>
of Kelethin hated your father, and the marriage between your
mother and him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your father was a Geomancer, the other counter part to
druids.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You see all things come in pairs, light and dark, fire and
water. And the same goes for<br>
the various guilds. Scouts and Monks, Paladins and Shadow
Knights, Clerics and<br>
Necromancers, Druids and Geomancers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry kept his thoughts about the other guilds that have no
opposite like enchanters and<br>
mages to himself..why mess with such a great explanation?<br>
<br>
&quot;Druids get their power from serving nature and in turn are
granted their abilities by<br>
nature, Geomancers on the other hand see nature as nothing more
then a tool and bend<br>
nature herself to their will. Needless to say, this upsets
Druids, but they keep this<br>
discontent to themselves because though they hate to admit it,
Geomancers are far<br>
more powerful and deadly then a thousand druids. And rightly so,
in all of history since<br>
their inception there has only been 35 Geomancers and your father
Augustas, was the<br>
last and the most powerful of them all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry was shocked; all of this was news to him&#133;so much that he
never knew about his<br>
own family&#133;.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was Father like before he disappeared?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He was kind, innocent man, he had great since of humor, and
an extremely<br>
overdeveloped love for the dramatic, honestly I'm surprised he
didn't show it off when<br>
he attacked.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For some reason, he just loved posing and calling out his
spell incantations. I guess he<br>
thought it made Geomancery seem really cool or something. To try
to when over<br>
disciples, I suppose..I don't really know for sure..he just loved
doing it.&quot; He smiled as a<br>
though passed though his head <br>
<br>
&quot;That spell he used, that you intercepted, was a toned down
version of his favorite<br>
spell, back when he rode with me.&quot; The king cleared his
throat and stepped away from<br>
the table.<br>
<br>
&quot;FINAL!!!&quot; He raised his hands above his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;FLASH!!!&quot; He twirled around like a top<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;AAAATTACCK!!!!&quot; He stopped his twirling his arms
outstretched towards Fry, his hands<br>
pressed against each other in fists.<br>
<br>
Fry couldn't help but laugh at this, not that he meant to&#133;but
honestly how could you<br>
not laugh at 270 year old High Elf King twirling around like a
top?<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I guess it is pretty funny when I do it, but still,
your father loved posing and it<br>
never served him wrong. Your mother loved it even more when he
did it, she got a big<br>
kick out of it, the only ones who hated it, where of course the
Druids of Kelethin. Which<br>
ended up in a very short duel over your mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think I should be telling your mothers love affairs&#133;.o
well! I love a good gossip&quot;<br>
He smiled &quot;You see back when Augustas proposed to your
mother, the Druidic<br>
Guildmaster was also in love with her, and wanted to marry her as
well. So he<br>
challenged Augustas to a duel and the prize being your
mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She actually allowed this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, she was a bit of an attention hog back in the old
days. I remember the duel well,<br>
Augustas and Skayer in the Kelethin training grounds, your mother
upon the hill staring<br>
wide eyed at the display being put on over her. Skayer summoned
his animal companions<br>
and they surged toward your father. He stood adamant until the
wolves and rabbits and<br>
bats where within an inch of his face.&quot;<br>
<br>
The King quickly whipped his hand in front of him
&quot;DISPERSAL! He cried! And the animal<br>
where scattered across the Greater Faydark and then it was over
for Skayer.&quot; <br>
<br>
The King stood up again twirling like a ditzy top once again
&quot;QUAKE WITH FEAR!!!! The<br>
ground shook and cracked and Skayer was knocked down unconscious
and the great<br>
Druid rings that had resided by Kelethin in perfect harmony for
centuries broke and<br>
crumbled and the great duel between Druidic and Geomancery was
over and your mother<br>
ran over and hugged Augustas giggling happily like a little
school girl&quot;<br>
<br>
The King looked sad after finishing this part of the tale.
&quot;She used to laugh a lot back<br>
then&#133;.I haven't heard her laugh since the War of
Heros..&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What happened? Why did Pop leave?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know why he left, but I suspect it has to do with
this Amulet and whoever this<br>
Kaiyan'wang is&#133;but you see this symbol on the amulet you
brought me?&quot; He held up the<br>
new one. &quot;It is exactly the same as the one, that I
recovered after the Battle of<br>
Lavastorm&#133;&quot; The King stared at the amulets and his mind
drifted back to that fateful<br>
day&#133;<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
&quot;CHARGE!&quot; The King cried upon his white warhorse, the
last of his army surged against<br>
the last of Lans T'val's coalition, the two ragged armies battled
amongst the lava flows.<br>
This was the true end to the War of Heros, the battle between the
famed heroes of<br>
Faydwer and Neriak. Tearis; Son of Nature and Lans T'val;
daughter of Hate. Augustas,<br>
the Geomancer and his nemesis Suradar, the Necromancer, Myria
,the Scout and<br>
Turnica, the Rogue. Each one legends in their own
countries..hence the name &#133;The War<br>
of Heroes<br>
<br>
Unlike what had been told to the public Lans had not disappeared
at Bloody Kithicor, she<br>
was not spirited away by Innorouk. It was a powerful blinding
spell utilized by her<br>
clerics&#133;and the perversion that still haunts Kithicor forest
was a direct result of the<br>
clashing of too powerful forms of magic. Necromancy and Geomancy,
so in away though<br>
the King will never say it nor will he allow any one to blame
him, it was partly Augustas's<br>
fault for the undead walking that haunt Kithicor at knight&#133;but
the battle could not have<br>
been won without Augustas's awesome power.<br>
<br>
Many fell against blades, some fell into the lava flows others
ran away in fear for their<br>
lives&#133;but amidst the chaos, two lovers stood their ground
proudly. One wielding<br>
awesome magics, the other swift and deadly daggers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Glacial ices, I give you haste! ICE BITE STRIKE!!!!&quot;
Thousands of ie shards left from<br>
Augustas's hands and pierced the onslaught of soldiers. <br>
<br>
&quot;You never get tired of that do you honey?&quot;<br>
<br>
'HAHA! NEVER! One must always take pride and have fun with their
work!&quot; He raised his<br>
hands above his head &quot;FINAL!&quot;<br>
<br>
Augustas began to spin, far more gracefully then the King, mana
gliding around him.<br>
&quot;FLASH!!&quot;<br>
<br>
He stopped his spin, arms outstretched, fists pointing directly
at a large column of<br>
soldiers &quot; AAAAAATTTTTTACK!!!!!&quot; A bolt of Fire and
lightning leapt out from his hands<br>
and just before it reached the first soldier, the bolt exploded
and the wave of fire and<br>
electricity scorched the oncoming soldiers.<br>
<br>
&quot;HAH!! YEAH!! I am number one!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No you are not&quot; <br>
She spun him around and kissed him passionately&#133;. in the
midst of a life threatening,<br>
battle of certain doom for all of Norrath&#133;.and they say dark
elfs are weird&#133;.. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am.&quot; She finished, when she broke off the kiss.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are so right, pardon me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are forgiven this time..but you have to make it up to
me later&#133;&#133;&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;GLADY!&quot; He said with a happy devilish smile<br>
<br>
&quot;By washing the dishes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh&#133;&#133;&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Hehe&quot; <br>
They embraced again&#133;.still in the middle of a life
threatening battle for all of Norrath<br>
mind you&#133; and as they held each other tightly. Both of them
gasped at what they saw<br>
behind each other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh..my GODS!!!&quot; She cried out<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazing&quot; he said almost silently&#133;<br>
<br>
They separated and she stood still disbelieving at what she saw&#133;a
50 foot high demon. <br>
<br>
&quot;uhh&#133;.Hon..got any idea on how to stop this?&quot;<br>
<br>
When she got no response, she looked around and realized
something. Augustas wasn't<br>
near by any more. She whirled around looking for him, but he was
gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;AUGUSTAS!!! WHERE ARE YOU!!&quot; she cried as loud as she
could, but still no reply&#133;.a<br>
loud thud and the ground shaking turned her back to the demon. It
was walking right to<br>
her&#133;she had no idea what to do&#133;..and for the first
time, she was actually scared for<br>
her life&#133;.She had never really encountered anything truly
abnormal like this..and the few<br>
truly weird and dangerous things she did come across&#133;he had
always been by her<br>
side&#133;they had never been apart&#133;.&#133;but now he was
gone&#133;she was<br>
scared&#133;&#133;terrified&#133;&#133;petrified&#133;<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;Through a combination of luck and last resorts, we where
able to defeat Lans and<br>
destroy that demon she summoned, it had been wearing this
amulet.&quot; He held up the old<br>
amulet. &quot;At first, I thought your mother had died, but later
as we where scouring the<br>
field for wounded, I found her in shivering and in tears&#133;no
apparent physical injuries..but<br>
she was never quite the same after that&#133;&#133;but that is
enough history for now Fry. I<br>
have a mission for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm ready Sir!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure you don't want to wait until the clerics can
finish healing your arm?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will be fine sir, I want to get to the bottom of
this.&quot;<br>
<br>
The King smiled. &quot;Good, good. Take these amulets and go to
EverFrost Peaks. I'll have<br>
my fastest ship take you to Qeynos, but you will have to make
your own way from<br>
there. Once you reach Everfrost, track down and seek the aid of
the Wizard Al'Kabor. He<br>
is recluse and does not like dealing with outsiders, but he
helped us during the war and<br>
he does owe me some favors for letting him work in my family's
private library. Take this<br>
slip from me as proof that you are my errant.&quot; <br>
<br>
He held up a small scroll with the royal seal and mark he had
never seen before,<br>
obviously some kind of personal mark that only the King and the
great Wizard Al'Kabor<br>
would know. It would be such an honor to be in his presence, the
legends and tales<br>
about him where only dwarfed by his great mastery of mana.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get what ever you can from him about these Amulets and see
if knows anything about<br>
this Kaiyan'wang. Leave when ever you are ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;By your leave M'lord&quot; Fry picked up the items, bowed
and dashed away.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope for your sake Fry, that he is in a good mood when
you meet him.&quot;<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
And so that is how Fry got in his current predicament, currently
the maid for &quot;the Great&quot;<br>
Al'kabor&#133;..well almost&#133;..I left out a few minor details&#133;I
guess, I should include<br>
those&#133;but it is getting late and once again I am running out
of ink&#133;that blasted<br>
merchant is overcharging again&#133;..I ought to show him a thing
or too&#133;oh well&#133;hopefully,<br>
I can get a decent supply of ink, so I can continue my husbands
tale. So until then my<br>
dear precious&#133;.human&#133;yucky&#133;..readers&#133;..I will
just have to transpose the events<br>
directly from Al'kabors diaries&#133;with all it's pretty flowers
on it ..hehehe..well you will just<br>
have to wait and ponder on why great wizard would have a diary
with flowers on<br>
it..hehehehe&#133;Fare well. </p>
