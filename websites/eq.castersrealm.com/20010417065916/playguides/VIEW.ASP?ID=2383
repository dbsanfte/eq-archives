  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>You have traveled far to the town of Rivervale to seek the tutelage of an old master rogue. As you slide into the hut you see no one, yet a voice calls to you.
<p>
"Welcome my student. So you want to be a rogue I take it? Well take a seat and we shall begin our lessons."
<p>
Out of no where the Rogue master appears. He's an old Halfling, well on in years. You can tell by looking at him, that he has seen much of the known world. He sits down and lights a pipe filled with JumJum Tobacco.
<p>
So a rogue is what you want to be? Well you have made a wonderful choice. As a Rogue, you will see places that others have not. You will be able to buy and sell wares where others cannot. You will be able to bind in any city, and you are essential in recovering corpses after your party dies. 
<p>
Now one thing most people miss in being a rogue, is the Roleplay capabilities. You are not a thief, but rather a treasure hunter. What? That rogue doesn't worship Bristlebane? Why that's blasphemy, no self respecting rogue doesn't worship Bristlebane. Are you a hopeless flirt or a bloodthirsty assasin. All those are things to consider race and religion in character creation. Stats I think are secondary. For my play style I chose Halfling/Bristlebane. I am the proud creation of my God, a Flirt you wouldn't believe, and a treasure hunter, not a thief.
<p>
Many people will tell you to be agnostic, but what fun is that? And you never know when some cool diety specific item might come along.
<p>
Now for stats. There are only really 2 stats to worry about. Strength and Dexterity. Agility helps raise your AC some but not that much. I believe the equation is like 3 agi = 1 AC. So I pretty much pass Agi up. Now it depends on how you want to fight. If you want to have your weapons proc alot, then get lots of Dex, if you want to carry alot of loot, and get those amazing backstabs, then Buff up Str. I went for a middle ground, with a little more concentration in my Dexterity. There are lots of items that will increase Str in the game, but alot less will increase Dex. 
<p>
Now levels 1-5: This all depends on your starting city. This is another reason I reccomend Halflings. Misty Thicket is great for levels 1-10. But first things first, lets train a few skills. You want to get piercing, and 1 hs. Just put one point into each skill. Also get one in sneak. Sneak has 2 uses. One is in conjunction with hide, to allow you to move invisible to undead and living, the other is to buy from any vendor. To buy from any vendor all you need to do is sneak behind the vendor first. This will get you indifferent prices. So if a vendor scowls at you, sneak behind and he/she will sell to you. Practice sneak anytime you are resting. You get a message telling you that you succeded or failed. Now go arm your dagger and start killing Snakes and fire Beetles, and the occasional Goblin Whelp. And start saving those coins. You will need them for all the equipment you need to buy. 
<p>
levels 5-10: Well if you are in Misty Thicket, you will now want to begin venturing beyond the Great Wall. Also train in Hide. Practice hide any time you are resting. The skill goes up really fast, and you will get a message when it succedes. Now that you have sneak and hide, you are in possesion of what I believe is the greatest skill set in the game. You can now go just about anywhere untouched. Now here are a few tricks for you. When you are hidden, CON EVERYTHING. Some things can see through it. If it's indifferent you are ok, if it's anything but indifferent, use discretion. Some Mobs that are scowling at you while hidden, can't actually see you, but because they will KOS anything the message is not indifferent. Hill giants and Sand Giants are one example. Also with sneak the aggro range on MOBS is reduced alot. So if you have Spirit of wolf and are sneaking and hiding, you can run past mobs and not get attacked. Also in these levels you get pick pocket. It's a great skill for making a fast plat. But if your group finds out you are using it, then be expected to go looking for another group in another zone. Keep this skill up as you will need it should you ever want to complete the Burning Raiper Quest. Pick lock is another skill you will be learning. I would practice it in befallen once you get it to a skill of 11. And for that reason, I wouldn't even train in pick locks until you hit level 11 so you save those precious training points. At level 11 all you need to spend is 1 training point, and you can begin your career. Pick lock is a long boring skill to train in, so be prepared for it. If you ever want to get your Burning raiper on your own, you need at least 125 in pick lock. Once you hit level 10, dump all your training points into Backstab. This skill is a pain to raise, as you have to be behind a mob to raise it. Using the skill for a frontal attack will not raise the skill at all. There are some tricks to raising it too.
<p>
Levels 11-20: Well you should be heading out of Misty Thicket about now. Maybe move on to the Gorge of King Xorrb, N ro, or oasis. You should be in Full Leather or if you have gotten alot of money some banded. You will be wanting to try and get your hands on a Dragoon Dirk, Dagger of Dropping, or some other magical weapon. Rusty just ain't gonna cut it. In this block of levels, you will be getting tons of skills. Train in them all. Most of these skills raise on their own in combat so one point will do. On apply poison, I would train in it once, but wait till you can make poison to really get into it. That is if you want to do poisons. At level 15 and 16, you get Double Attack and Dual weild. Now Dual weild is a great skill. This is why you will want to have kept your 1 hs skill up to snuff. There are alot of great 1hs weapons you can use in your offhand. Things like Short Swords of They Yekesha, Claw weapons, whips, a whole variety of things, many of which have procs on them. Keeping yourself open to that kind of variety is essential. Now these levels will get boring real fast if you hang out in the standard places, like N ro, and oasis. I reccomend some nice alternatives. Permafrost right by the entrance is great, and very uncrowded, but that can be a problem as well in finding a group. The Gorge is usually semi busy, but not overly crowded. The mino caves in Steamfront mountains are great, albiet a little dangerous as Meldrath and the Mino hero can come wreak havoc on you every once in awhile. Najena and Lavastorm are also alot of fun. Or Even Befallen. There are tons of choices. You don't have to follow the crowd. As you get closer to 20 you may want to head over to South Karana. if you have problems findin a group, you can always go practice backstab up in the penthouse. Just ask what ever group is up there, if you can practice up, and I am sure they will let you, Just don't Kill steal. 
<p>
Levels 21-30: Well as a rogue, I would reccomend you go to The Lost Temple of Cazic Thule. You can fly through these levels in there, and even get some of your class specific armor. Ravenscale. There are tons of nice items to get here. For low 20's I reccomend clearing trash in the Courtyard, mid 20's head into the maze, and upper 20's just shout for any group that will have you. You will want to try to get into an Archon Base group, Throne Room Group, and Pool Group. All of those places can get you some Ravenscale armor or other nice pieces of armor. Also you get the last of your skills in this block of levels. You may want to train a few points into Instill doubt to get it primed, and then go practice. What ever you do, do not practice it in a dungeon. You can kill alot of people including yourself by doing so. Instill Doubt in a dungeon is a Train maker. You can practice it up by targeting any NPC, and then going acros the zone, and clicking on it. It will go up slowly, but it will raise with no danger. On a side note, unless you get the kick in, you will stay hidden while practicing. 
<p>
Levels 30 and beyond: Well you have all your skills, and should have some decent equipment. The world has really opened up to you now. Now may be the time for you to start seeing the world. Go see what it's like in the lost city of Cabilis. Go venture into the depths of Paineel. There are tons of places to hunt at these levels. Some people stay in Lower Guk and Sol B till they hit 50 or higher. But there is so much more. There are many Kunark dungeons that are perfect for you and even yield you a higher rate of Exp gain, as well as loot. From these levels on I tell you to see the world. Don't follow the crowds. And most of All HAVE FUN.</td></tr>
