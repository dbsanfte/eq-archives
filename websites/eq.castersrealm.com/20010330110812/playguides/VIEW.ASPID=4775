  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p>AS a level 50 shadowknight on a blue server you may think i
haven't tangoed in PVP enough and therefore have no right to
write a strategy guide on how to do it. However, i have been in
more then 100 PVP duels with 97 percent of them being wins. (most
of my losses have occured when i choose to duel characters more
the 4 levels over me, or when i dueled another SK, or didn;t
bother having HT up.) So i think you will find my observations
correct maybe even some of you on those red servers.<br>
<br>
The breakdown of SK vs classes<br>
<br>
I should note that some zones seem to allow fear in PVP while
others do not. if fear is avalable then beating all races but
warriors is VERY simple. Simply cast darkness then cast your best
fear spell then chase behind them while they run helpless. You
can easily do this 2 95 percent of the classes, although you may
have to repeat once or twice.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.Vs. a wizard<br>
ahhh so you chose to do battle with a literal cannon of
firepower. Dueling a lvl 50 wizard can be extremly painful.
unlike previous wizards who might have to empty an entire mana
bar and still not kill you these badboys can do it in 3/7 shots
of icecomet. (7 ic's is how many a lvl 50 wiz with 200 int can
cast) The wizard will try to root you, shadowstep away from you
and nuke and very few nukes can easily kill you.<br>
what spells to use:<br>
1. dooming darkness- very nice dmg even in PVP will also slow the
targets ability to run<br>
2. shadowstep- if the wizard decides to try to root you then cast
bolt on you from outside your spell range this spell can allow
you to dodge the bolt. it also can severely disorient the wizard.<br>
3. life leech- this spell siphons a good amount of life back to
you even with the high mana cost.<br>
4. your 45 hp lifetap<br>
5. heat blood small dot<br>
6. disease cloud this low level spell stacks with the rest of
your dots use it! every point a caster loses per round will make
him that much closer to dying.<br>
7. heart flutter<br>
8. fear (if applicable)<br>
<br>
these spells are all thats needed during the conflict. before you
start i suggest you use your cold resist spell (IC is cold based
:) summon a pet and buff him with our pet buff (give pet weapons
so he can duel weild)also wear all the resist gear you can.
spells are nerfed a bit in PVP and high resists can make you the
bane of there existance. also have see invis up so they cannpt
hide that way.<br>
<br>
winning:<br>
The key to beating a wizard in a duel is to remeber one very
important thing. wizards have almost 0 defense and VERY low hps.
don;t get cocky. When dueling a smart wizard he will use root and
shadowstep to stay far away from you. If he does this simply
sending in the pet and casting your variety of DOTs, and big
lifetap (should come when you've lost enough hps to use it) in
addtion to getting in one chance to HT should kill him easily <br>
THe wizard will most likly try to avoid getting any where near
you and this can lead to a loooong fight. The shorter the fight
the more likly you are the winner. when the opportunity is there
mele like mad. Against a stupid (not oriented to PVP) wizard he
will most likly just stand there and expect you to fall dead from
2 nukes he may try to root but will most likly run scared right
into your darkness spell and his demise.<br>
<br>
mage:<br>
the mage can nuke a bit but not nearly as dangerously as the
wizard. he will rely on you to fight his pet and his pet to
protect him and root you, since mages CANNOT root. This is a
fairly simple battle. <br>
1. dooming<br>
2. life leech<br>
3. shadowstep<br>
4. fear (if applicable)<br>
(have a pet out buffed and with weapons, see invis)<br>
how to win:<br>
like the wizard mages have almost no hps or defense. unlike
wizards the only possible way they ahve to evade you is to run,
or rely on there pet to draw your attention. a smart mage will
know that his pet offers you no challenge and run, hide and try
to slowly wear you down through frustration and nuke and run
techniques. To deal with the casters pet simply sic your puny
little pet on it. yes your pet will die. BUT a mage pet will not
back off something that is attacking it. You now have the life of
your pet to kill tha mage. which is a fairly easy task.
darkness-run up HT/hit with weapon. use leech as soon as you have
lost enoguh hps to warrant it. even nerfed ht will undo 2 bubbles
of health on a mage and leech will do at least 1. darkness and
combined with your mele will kill the mage fast.<br>
<br>
3. oh the pain-dueling enchanters<br>
encahnters are the hardest class for an SK to duel if they are
smart. they will encumber you. not let you move and take away all
your stats. if high enough level they will take away all your
mana as well. yet enchanters have the same physical weakness as
weakness as wizards and mages. BUT enchanters cannot truly hurt
you with their spells they are extremly weak in dmg. THis is by
far my arch nemesis and my hardest and longest duels have always
been against them.<br>
spells<br>
1.disease cloud<br>
2.dooming darkness<br>
3.engulfing darkness<br>
4.heart flutter <br>
5.shadowstep<br>
6.heat blood<br>
7.see invis<br>
<br>
(have a pet up as in all previous examples.)<br>
how to win<br>
kill the enchanter before he casts. if you can;t do that your in
for a long fight. my first move against an encahnter is to cast
disease cloud on myself. this spell does minimum dmg to you
although it makes it impossible for him to mez you. as the fight
begings sick your pet on him HT him and mele. chances ar you will
not be so lucky as to be able to kill him with mele before he
roots you but feel free to try. the encahters main strategy at
this point will be to keep you rooted while he debuffs you to
hell. durinf this time period keep casting cancel magic. until
you are satisfied that he has lost his massive MR buff.
encahnters will normally debuff a SK before they take your mana
so casting all your dots early is important. You won;t be able to
land any of them unless you have removed his MR. using leech
isn;t a bad idea even if you don;t need the hps yet. a enchanter
can easily take away 150 str garunteeing you will become so
encumbered as to not be able to walk. the key is not to try. the
initial HT and mele plus the dots should kill him. and kill him
faster then his measly DD and dot spells can kill you. a stupid
enchanter wont try to debuff you instead relying on root dot or
root nuke. in which case your spells will out dmg him in your
dmg/his hps to his dmg/your hps. good luck this will be a tough
fight!<br>
<br>
4. necros the brother <br>
necros have better versions of all your spells. they have no hps
you have alot. they have a good pet yours is poop. A necro will
most likly use the mages tactics, or if your unlucky the wizards.
the way to beat the tar out of him is the same as the two classes
depending on his PVP style.<br>
<br>
5.monk<br>
the only way you are gonna touch this guy after 45 is to kite him
and at the apropriate time HT. another stragety which takes far
longer and is more risky is to keep sneaking up invis since monks
don;t get this skill :) hit him in the back and run away repeat.
if the monk has high resists, keep trying any way or use invis
tactic. tough call. do not take on a monk face to face. you will
be humiliated faster then you can say WTB bandages!<br>
<br>
6. rogue the little poker<br>
keep your face to him don;t let him behind you. dots are a
powerful ally. watch for disarm. kite if in danger use shadostep
to escape.use disarm! it may be low level but if you pound it you
will take at least one weapon during the fight. invs tactics make
work here as well. you should win cuase you got HT. some rogues
have high resists. if this is the case. don;t try to continuosly
cast your dots. stick to taps. it will cost less mana then
getting resisted 200 times.<br>
pet doesn;t hurt prolly won;t help.<br>
<br>
7.warrior kindling.<br>
the only thing loaded against a high lvl warrior should be any
unresitable type spells you have. taps siphons pets etc. a
warrior will want to go head to head. agree to it. use disarm and
make sure you recover fast when he uses his. tap constantly
especially if you have a big 2 hander. you will do 2/3 of his
mele dmg over the course of the fight. but your taps will balance
your hps with his, and your HT will win it for you when your at
half a bubble and hes at a bubble.<br>
<br>
8.paladin lil goodie two shoes...<br>
paldins do almsot the exact mele dmg as you.<br>
you have dots they have heals<br>
they have stuns you have a crappy pet (we lose on this one)<br>
they have blind you have run around like a madman. ( if you can
darken the paladin and you are not rooted he won;t catch you when
blind run! if rooted have a hotkey for shadowstep and make him
run around after you you'll stay rooted but change position. also
when blind i like to spin around in circles if rooted in between
shadowsteps on the rare chance I'll hit that bastich) once a
paldin learns that hes not gaining much but a headache from
blinding you he'll stop convinced he can beat your ass.<br>
my strtegy is to dot and mele them to hell. most paldins
surprisingly will not step back to heal, or if they do it gives
you another chance to dot more and refresh you dots. our dots are
more efficient then there heals. most paldins will heal maybe 6
times in a fight if it lasts a long time. Watch out for disarm.
debuff there buffs if you feel the need.<br>
save HT for the killing stroke. you should have a good idea what
HT does to you. try it out sometime. it will do the same dmg to
him if you are equal lvl. as soon as you are in range to have HT
kill him use it. most paladins will use LOHs way to late. if you
are seriously pounding your paladin friend don;t use HT at all.
try to kill him but if he gets LOHs off before you do you will
have a huge advantage this time around in that he cannot LOH this
time use HT right before it will kill him and make im consider
running to heal.<br>
<br>
9.rangers.<br>
debuff using cancel magic (DMG shields suck)<br>
mele<br>
disarm<br>
dot<br>
tap <br>
HT <br>
kill<br>
<br>
if they try to kite you let them and show them your superior dmg
spells. if they try to mele them eat them with HT much like a
rogue but you don;t have to worry about backstab :)<br>
<br>
10. bards sing me a song your the piano man.<br>
<br>
bards are very useful group members however in one on one against
a SK they can;t use there only soloing method. kiting. stick a
darkness and then pound them to hell VERY easy fight. HT if you
feel frisky.<br>
<br>
11.shaman<br>
<br>
nice dots/debuffs the root they heal little of everything. but
you can win. unless a shaman uses some truly evil tricks i have
NEVER seen the fightshould be straight forward he will try to
root and dot you occasionaly pound on you. but in the end your AC
and mele and dots simply out does his. make sure you have cancel
magic loaded in case you are slowed.<br>
<br>
12 druid<br>
<br>
many people fear druids in duels. I'm not really sure why. true a
warrior can be very frustrated with there kiting etc, but as for
us SKs it should be a problem. Druids ften rely heavily on kiting
in duels.<br>
if this is the case like bards they will die quikly. doing as
much dmg as possible early in the fight can save you from a post
death fight from dots. if rooted try to shadowstep out of range.
druid will beat you in a dot contest. HT early in this fight.<br>
<br>
13 cleric the last to fall<br>
<br>
clerics can be frustrating fights what he is gonna do is CH
himself like 9 times during the fight. clerics do have some
pretty good nukes. fighting them like wizards isn;t a bad idea
except this time use only one dot that being darkness. dooming
will allow you to slowly eat away at the clerics mana pool and
not allow him to stay full health. dooming has the best mana
ratio. expect a very long fight with a cleric. use subversion
invis etc. using hit and run techniques is a good idea. if the
cleric is kinda low on health try HT. keep takign chunks outta
him and you will win.<br>
<br>
hope you liked my guide, its sooo long i gotta sleep<br>
