      <td width='95%' align='left' valign='top' colspan=2><b><font color='#80000'>THE QUEST FOR THE WHEEL/ICE COMET</font>, By Calandria incendre</b><br><br><p>&nbsp;OK, I just did this quest at level 31. Here is the way I did it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;First, I ported to GFay, then ran to Dagnor's Cauldron. The rod here is at the loc neg 890, neg 740, in front and to the left of the entrance to kedge keep, underwater. The easiest way to get here is to invis and
level till you find the coordinates then go down and get it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Second, I went into Unrest which is off Dagnor's Cauldron. There is a small waterway on the right hand side of the zone. swim on the right hand side of the water. you will see 2 tunnels. take the smaller one on the right hand side. you have to swim in, swim up, then swim in some more. it's laying there on the bottom. As soon as I had this piece, I gated to West Commons.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Third, I ran invis to Neriak, and went in. Unless you are Dark Elf, you have to do this quickly before your invis wears off. The rod is in the second zone inside Neriak, Neriak commons. After you run past the priest of discord, you will go through a gate, and onto a bridge. Jump over the left hand side of the bridge, and into the water under the bridge. The rod is on the ground in front of the windows. Then I immediately gated to N. Ro.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Fourth, I ran to oasis, and got a druid friend to help me. Before I did anything
else, I bound myself at the dock area. Now, if you have levitate on, and you get in the water and page up/page down just right you will be able to see clearly underwater. I had my druid friend put on his wolf form, and get close enough to cast a DD spell on the goblins in the top of the tower (the tower is an exact replica of the spec tower) Pulling the deepwater gobs in the top of the tower does not pull the ones on the bottom. Once he had pulled them, he ran like mad for the S. Ro zone. Once the gobs were out of the way, I swam down, grabbed the rod, and gated.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Fifth, I went to lower guk. If you don't know the way, shout at the entrance to upper guk, and more than likely someone will be willing to show you the way. Once you get to lower guk, you need to have someone cast Invis
vs. Undead on you. Hopefully, the hand room will be camped (it usually is) I had to have someone show me how to get there cause I had never been there before. The rod is in the upper part of the room, on the right. If your video settings aren't right, the rod may blend in with the floor, and you will have a hard time seeing it. once you have that rod, gate out to
North Karana.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Sixth, I went to high hold pass. The rod there is in the water underneath the waterfall by the Tiger's Roar Inn.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Seventh, to save a little time I ported BACK to North Karana, and ran to lake rathe. Once in Lake Rathe (you will need a potion to enable you to breathe underwater. I found mine in west
Freeport at Torlig's Herbs and Medicines. I can't remember which one it was, but you can right click on them to find
out) go to the island directly across from the entrance, it has a large tower on it, known as the flame tower or the diving
board.Underneith this island are 2 tunnel entrances. In the middle, under the island, is a tower that
looks exactly like the spec and DW Gob towers in oasis. The rod is in the top of the tower on the floor. Now, I don't know if I got lucky or what, but only one of the DW Gobs that were there were ready to attack, and it was one of the ones on the bottom of the tower. So I grabbed the rod and gated to Tox forest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Eighth, I ran/took the boat to Erud's crossing. Once there, I ran around the island till I could see the mast of a sunken boat. I cast levitiate on myself, and did the swim/bob trick again till I got
approximately to the coordinates of the rod (neg 1162, pos 2340) and dived for it.
apparently, Verant took out the sharks, so there is no problem getting this rod, aside from the zombies on the ship, which were green to me, but still attacked me. Killed them easily. I then got back on the boat, and headed for Quenos.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Ninth, once I was in Quenos, I went to the Aqueducts. I had to have someone show me the way, because I had only been there once before, and there are things in there that are still red to me at 31. The rod here is in the middle of the shark pit. The shark was green to me at 31 and did not attack me. Once I had that piece, I hightailed it for Everfrost Peaks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Tenth, Once in Everfrost, I went to the river. It's a long underwater swim, so once again, you need the underwater potion. First of all, I had to find the one hole in the ice, which is at pos 2420, neg 4060. I stayed on the west hand side of the river, since it forks. Once I was out of the water, and into the caves, I hugged the right hand wall till I found  a building. Inside this building are 3 icebone skeletons, which were green but still attacked. Got rid of them easily, and ran out of the caves, swam back for the hole, and the ran to Sulgar. I'm not sure of his loc, but he stands nearby 2 barbarians, and he is wearing a white robe. I asked him 'what is Tarton Wheel' and followed the
dialogue from there. Note that if you hail him, he talks about Tarton's Wheel, and this will do nothing. you have to leave off the 's. Once I got the box from him, I put all the pieces of the rod in it, hit combine, and BOOM! I had the staff.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;DO NOT do this part of the quest first since the box is no rent. Once you have the staff, you can keep it, as I did, or you can turn it back into him for the runes needed for the level 49 Wizard spell, Ice Comet.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;If you need the runes for Ice Comet, make sure your research is very high, as you can still fail on combining them in your lexicon, and you don't want to have to do the quest again /grin it was hard enough the first time.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;This whole quest took me about 5 hours of playing time. It's not too hard in retrospect, although it can look daunting at first. Good Luck!<br>
