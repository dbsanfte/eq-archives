</tr>
<tr> 
<td width='80%'><P>Having found Ferrik Bloodforge’s treatise on Solusek A I 
decided to venture to that remote dungeon myself. What a wonderful surprise, I 
have enjoyed my time there immeasurably. I put pen to parchment now in the hopes 
that others can benefit from my experiences. I have written much of this from a 
Paladin’s prospective. For this I do not apologize, for I am, after a 
Paladin.</P><B>
<p><u>G</u></B><u><b>reyfin’s Rules for Solusek A</b></u></p>
<ol>
  <li>Don’t fall into the lava</li>
  <li>Don’t forget rule 1</li>
  <li>Don’t 
pull on the stairs. If you do you will eventually fall into the lava and break 
rules 1, 2 and 6.</li>
  <li>Know where the nearest zone to Sol B is. As strange as 
it sounds it’s a good place to escape to. Sure sometimes you die when trains 
collide, but that is very rare.</li>
  <li>Once down the stairs and inside the 
"window room" don’t run back up to the stairs to zone. Use the Sol B zone near 
the "safe spot."</li>
  <li>Don’t swim in the lava</li>
  <li>NO RUNNERS: ensnare or root 
everything.</li>
  <li>IF there is a runner, RUN, gate or die. Don’t wait for the dam 
to break. It already has you just can’t see the wall of water about to fall on 
your head. If you let a goblin escape you will see the gates of hell open up. 
Shout TRAIN! and scoot.</li>
  <li>If it moves, kill it. Many of the NPC’s wander around Sol 
A. All the NPC’s have place holders. If you’re looking for any of these you have 
to kill the wanderers.</li>
  <li>Don’t cast Area Effect spells unless you know EXACTLY 
where you are. I’ve seen many a caster die because the employees of the Solusek 
Mining Company are so short they weren’t seen...</li>
  <li>Always have batwings 
(see rules 1, 2 and 6) make sure everyone in your party has one or two (the 
worst feeling in the world is when the guy with all the batwings is at the 
bottom of the lava stream).</li>
  <li>No one dies. Go slow, follow the rules and 
Rule 11 will rarely be broken.</li>
</ol>
<P><BR><B>About Lava</B>: Just about everyone has heard that 
the lava at Sol A is bad. Because of this, often people do not want to go to 
there. Well, I’m here to tell you it’s not that bad at all. 95% of the BAD lava 
is in the first 10% of the dungeon. Go slowly, pull whatever is on the stairs 
back to the top and no one should fall in. Falling into the lava is a pain 
because you have to retrieve your corpse and only you can do it (others can’t do 
it because they can’t target your corpse when it’s in lava. Well, not unless 
they want to go swimming to find it). IF you do fall in, get as close as you can 
to the corner near the window (keep reading you'll understand soon). I’ve seen 
people drag their body from the path/stairs when they died in this area. If you 
don’t get lucky you will have to levitate and drag you corpse either back onto 
the path or further on you will eventually find some stone where you can bring 
your body. I would suggest you just getting back onto the path.<BR><BR>Now 
sometimes Levitate doesn’t float you high enough to get back on the path. This 
can happen for 2 reasons: you follow the lava stream to a pathway that leads 
down and the roof will force you down and sometimes levitate will drop you below 
the path, but above the lava for no reason. DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAVA WHERE IT 
ENTERS THE TUNNEL (the one that leads down). Nothing good will come of it. If 
your body is in the lava and you can’t find it, don’t go here to look. It’s not 
down there, the only way bodies get there is if you drag it there, whatever you 
do NEVER DRAG YOUR BODY DOWN THIS TUNNEL. IF you end up floating above the lava 
but too low to get back on the path for no reason you can try and climb back up 
the wall (it works sometimes) or contact a GM/Guide. I have had great success 
with asking guides and GM’s for help with this bug (they usually teleport me 
out, so loot your corpse before you ask for help<BR><BR>ONE TIME I fell into the 
lava and was able to successfully CLIMB THE WALL and get out of the lava. I was 
never able to do it again and no one I know has done it, but it’s worth trying. 
Find the corner near the window room and try and climb up, like you would a 
ladder.</P><I>
<P>"The best way to avoid the initial lava is to go in through 
Sol B. Enter Sol B and make all lefts that you can until you zone into Sol A... 
With Sol B as heavily camped as it is there should be no problem doing this.</P>
</I>
<P><i>- Beldukil Lawbringer High Elf Lvl 50 Paladin 
Povar</i></P>
<P><B>GETTING THERE</B>: Solusek’s Eye, (Sol A) can be 
found in Lavastorm Mountains (LS). It is often mistaken for Nagafen’s Lair (Sol 
B). This causes some confusion and the misperception that it is a very high 
level dungeon: it’s not as hard as you think. Sol B is an extremely difficult 
dungeon, don’t expect to go to Sol B till you’re well into your 30’s (and from 
what I’ve heard, you don’t need to leave before 50). Now don’t get me wrong, Sol 
A is not easy; I’ve seen parties in there high 30’s have trouble there. I’m just 
saying a lot of people come too late. I got there around level 23 and had great 
fun. In fact, it’s a much harder dungeon after level 27; now you have to fight 
your way past annoying greens to get experience.<BR><BR><B>THE LOOT: </B>I found 
the experience and the loot to be greater than many of the other areas people of 
my level were fighting in (Mistmoore, Unrest, Cazic Thule, Permafrost and High 
Hold Keep) and certainly the train makes less stops in Sol A then in MM, Unrest 
and CZ. The experience is great here. I will finish this guide with some ideas 
about where to go to get the most experience, you can skip there now, but it 
won’t mean as much to you until you’ve read the whole guide. I love this 
dungeon. With everyone complaining about overcrowding, I am constantly amazed at 
how few people are at Solusek A. With the recent invasion of Splitpaw Solusek 
don’t expect anything to change either (which is a good thing, IMHO). I have 
included a quick reference at the end of this guide.</P><B>
<P>ON BINDING</B>: Freeport is the 
typical binding point for melee types who can’t get bound in Neriak. I suggest 
binding in High Hold Pass. It’s a little farther to run than Freeport, but you 
can always get a Spirit of the Wolf and that is nice in the low 20’s when you’re 
running though Nektulos Forest. Around level 27 I started binding in Freeport. 
There was a rumor you could bind in the Solusek Temple (that would have been 
nice) it’s not true.</P>
<P>Note: With the changes made to Kithicor Forest you may want to 
skip High Hold Pass and just bind in Freeport.</P>
<P><B>OF INTEREST</B>: Dwarves and, I heard a rumor, 
Erudites, are not KOS to the Goblins in Sol A unless you have done something to 
lose faction with them (it took me about 1 whole level to become KOS)… I spent 2 
days walking around Sol A, learning my way around. Except for 4 mobs (2 of which 
are NPC’s there is nothing in Sol A that will bother a sight-seeing dwarf (so 
pack a lunch and bring the kids).</P>
<P> There is a rumor that the Gnomish Vendor in the Castle 
sells Melatite. It’s not true. Like all vendors he sells it if another Player 
sold it to him. And before people knew how to do the Armor of Ro quests I’m sure 
players sold it to him, not anymore. So don’t get your hopes up.</P>
<P>Invis doesn’t work very well in Sol A as all the spell 
casters and the gnomes can see invis.</P>
<P>Killing Kobolds in Sol B will raise your faction with 
Solusek Mining Company (but not the Ak’anon faction). A useful thing to know if 
you’re an evil race (since you’re KOS to the Mining Company otherwise) or anyone 
who plans to camp the employees of the Solusek Mining Company and their 
mechanicals. This isn’t really an option before level 30, although I did venture 
down here and take swings at some kobolds when I was in my 20’s, but only when 
others were actually fighting them. I still haven’t raised my faction above 
indifferent.</P>
<P> Paladins can solo here from Level 22 - 27 (after 27 you 
stop getting exp)... It's not great but since we rarely get to solo anything 
it's fun for a change and this is better than running somewhere else to fight... 
Pull to the Sol B room and root when the goblins get near 40%... Even if they do 
run you should have time to catch them, if you don't they'll train, but you'll 
have time to zone to Sol B. I’ve solo’d the Predator room and the Foreman rooms 
at level 31, but I wouldn’t recommend it until you learn the zone very well (or 
after level 35)</P>
<P><B>THE SAFE AREA</B>: Ferrick identified 2 areas in Sol A, 
the Goblin Stronghold and the Gnome Castle. The only thing I will do is add 
another area, I call it the safe area. It’s "safe" because because nothing 
spawns on this side of Sol A. Unless someone pulls/trains something, you will 
not see any Goblins here. There is also a relatively safe zone to Sol B here, 
for escape purposes. The safe area is good place to rest, meditate and even 
camp. It’s also a useful reference point ("meet you in the safe area"). Getting 
there is very easy. After zoning in you will see some stairs. At the midway 
point you will find a window (some call it a crack). This room and the one that 
adjoins it I call the window room. The window room has 2 exits: one leading back 
to the stairs (I never bother with this exit, using the window instead) and one 
that leads to a ledge (I will come back here a lot, when I say "the ledge" I 
mean here). At the ledge, if you take a right, you will enter a hallway that 
opens up to a path leading down and a bridge that dead-ends into the wall. This 
is the safe area. Continuing down the ramp, you come to a room and a short hall 
to the Sol B zone. I refer to this room simply as the Sol B room (for obvious 
reasons).</P>
<P>Back to the ledge, there is a door straight ahead of you in 
a small pit-like area (jump or take the stairs). It leads to the Goblin 
Stronghold. This is where you will find the Goblin King, the Goblin Bartender, 
the Goblin Drunkard (who new they drank so much?) the Goblin High Shaman and the 
Infernal Torturer. Solusek Goblins (the toughest kind there is in Solusek – go 
figure) can only be found in the stronghold.</P>
<P>The Castle area is where the employees of the Solusek Mining 
Company live. This does not mean there are no Goblins in the "Castle area." They 
just don’t live in the Castle-proper. In fact, there are as many goblins living 
in this area as in the Stronghold. In the Castle area you will find some very 
nice NPC’s: Kindle, Singe, the Goblin Foreman, the Kobold Predator, the Goblin 
Captain, The Clockwork EXG, Gabbie Mardoddle, Reckless Efreeti (I’ll include 
their drops when I talk about where to find them), Captain Bipnipple and the 
Lava Elemental.</P><B>
<P>KOBOLD PREDATOR AND THE GOBLIN FOREMAN</B>: From the ledge (you’re facing the doorway to the Goblin 
Stronghold), turning left you will see some Goblins (at least 2, but very often 
there is a wandering goblin there as well). There is a hallway to the left. This 
is the "hard way" to the<B> </B>Predator room as you will have to fight about 
12-15 goblins to get here, but if you’re with evil races you have to go this way 
as they are KOS to the employees of the Solusek Mining Company. Take it, 
continuing straight over the bridge (more lava). Eventually you will come to a 
hallway leading to the left. At the end of this hall you come to a door. The 
<B>Kobold Predator </B>is often behind this door (he wanders up and down the 
hall). Like most of the spawns in Sol A the Predator is roughly a 20 minute 
spawn. But he has place-holders, I’ve seen him spawn twice in a 6 hour stretch 
and 4 times in a row another time. The Predator drops Kobold-Hide Boots (AC5 +3 
AGI +10 HP) and the rare Obsidian Shard (6 Dmg 25 Dly Effect: Obsidian Shatter – 
30 point Direct Damage AND reduces AC by about 30 points, a very nice 
spell).</P>
<P>Note: I’ve been told that Obsidian Shatter is a fire based 
spell and as such is not very useful in Sol A as the goblins there have high 
fire resistance (go figure).</P>
<P>You’ll have to fight your way to hallway (unless you get 
lucky with invis and there are no casters on the path.) Once you get to hall you 
can rest (don’t sit too close to the doorways). The nice thing is the hall is 
safe as only 1 MOB will venture in here. The good news is that mob is the 
Predator or his placeholder, a goblin. Either way kill anything you see in this 
hall. Open the door and you will be on a landing at the top of some stairs. The 
Predator spawns on this landing. Kill whatever is here. The nice thing is you 
will not agro the 2 goblins in the room below. When you’re done go down and 
clear the other 2 goblins. There is one exit (other than the one you came in) in 
this room. Through that door there are 3 goblins in here. The one in the middle 
is the <B>Goblin Foreman</B> (behind the well-like structure). He drops the 
Foreman Tunic (10AC 0 weight +3 STR +3 WIS) or the Obsidian Scimitar (6 dmg 27 
dly +6 AGI). Like most of the spawns in Sol A, his is roughly a 20 mins spawn. 
But he has place-holders, I’ve seen him spawn twice in a 6 hour stretch and 4 
times in a row another time.</P>
<P>A full group of mid-20’s can handle both these rooms. Around 
level 27 I could handle both rooms with 2 other people. At 30 I could handle the 
Predator room by myself. (it’s very hard to break up the Foreman room solo, but 
I’ve done it. I wouldn’t suggest it till you know what you’re doing. In the back 
of the Foreman room is a secret door. The hallway behind here is very safe. 
Goblins don’t wander through here unless pulled.</P>
<P>Now, the easy way into the Foreman/Predator rooms. Go back 
to the ledge take a left again, but this time keep going. There’s a small alcove 
with 2 goblins fairly close, continue on. You will come to another small alcove 
with your first Gnome Mechanical in it. Don’t fight him unless your in your 
30’s, have a good group and don’t mind the faction hits. From the alcove there 
is a sharp (very easy to miss) left that leads to an L-shaped bridge (more 
lava). Go across. When you reach the end of the bridge, stop. There is a hallway 
to your left (again, VERY easy to miss) take it. You will pass a doorway and go 
up some small steps, when you come to a charred section of the wall on your 
right (same wall the door was on) stop. This charred section is actually a 
secret door, go through it. You are now in the secret hallway that leads to the 
Foreman room. Go forward and take your first left, then right, then left again 
and you should be looking at a another secret doorway (you can tell by the small 
holes in the surface, if you see them – they’re usually more visible from the 
back side). Well, we’re back to the secret door to the Goblin Foreman 
room.</P><B>
<P>SINGE AND KINDLE</B>: Two NPC’s, 
they fly around the Castle area (never venturing into the castle-proper). Like 
all the other NPC’s in Sol A they have place-holders. My best advice is whack 
any wondering goblin you see (rule #9). They were blue to me at 27, but hit hard 
(IMHO Singe hits harder). They wander all over the castle area. <B>Singe</B>, a 
Fire Drake, sometimes goes as far as the ledge over by the Stronghold. Singe 
commonly drops the Obsidian Bead Hoop (AC2 +3 AGI +3 INT – I’ve traded them to 
spell-casters for some very nice items) and rarely the Drake Scale Belt (AC5 +3 
DEX +10 vs Fire – spell-casters love em). Personally I’ve killed Singe a dozen 
times and I’ve never seen the belt, so I’m starting to have my doubts. Maybe 
it’s a myth. <B>Kindle</B>, a Fire Imp, I see much less frequently. I don’t know 
why maybe I’m unlucky. Some other possibilities: he makes less noise than Singe 
(who’s screach can be heard a good distance away) so people aren’t, so apt to no 
he’s around , he roams less or people tend to kill his place-holder less often. 
Kindle’s drop is either the boring Obsidian Ring (AC3 +3 DEX +10 HP) or the Imp 
Skin Gloves (AC2 +5 INT +10 Mana – spell-casters love em).</P>
<P>Back to the secret hall behind the Foreman room. If you’re 
facing the room, there is a hall that branches off to your right. Follow this 
and you will come to another secret door, you will enter a room with 3 doors and 
2-3 goblins. These goblins are nastier (flame, fire and inferno) than the ones 
you’ve seen so fare, so be prepared for a fight. I’m told that Singe spawns in 
this room. I have never seen him in this room, but that’s the legend. The door 
to the left leads to a Sol B zone B (a very useful escape route! – see rule 5). 
The door straight ahead is the one we want. Open the door and move forward. 
There are 3 (maybe 2?) goblins in this area, if you follow the left wall you 
will find another zone to Sol B (a very useful escape route! – see rule 5). IF 
you go through the door, walk forward a bit and turn around you will see an exit 
to your left (it’s, very easy to miss). You will see some stairs up and a tunnel 
entrance. There is one goblin in the corner of this area and another on top of 
the stairs on the ledge. Most times, if I was lucky enough to find him, I found 
Singe on this ledge.</P>
<P>If you go into the tunnel you will sometimes run into 
Kindle. It’s a dangerous place as there are many goblins down here. Since Kindle 
likes to wander, I really wouldn’t recommend it going down here to hunt him 
unless you really know what you’re doing or have good faction with the Goblins. 
Back to the ledge where we hopefully find Singe… There’s a door on this ledge, 
go in. You’re now in a short hallway go through the next door. You will find 
yourself into a room with a table and a 2<SUP>nd</SUP> door in the far wall. IF 
you go to the right hand corner you will find a secret door. This leads down to 
a pit where the Reckless Efreeti Spawns</P><B>
<P>The Reckless Efreeti</B>: My 
favorite Graphic in the game, to date (I love the laugh too). He drops two very 
nice items: Platinum Armbands (0 AC +3 WIS +3 STR – druids love em, as will your 
occasional High Elf Cleric) and the rare Obsidian Flamberge (20 dmg 50 dly 
effect: Obsidian Shatter PAL WAR SK 2H Sword - No Drop/Lore). Not as good as the 
Gigantic Zweihander, but it’s a nice 2-handed weapon, especially since 
practically no one has heard of it). He has company, 2 Blazings Elementals, 
around their mid-20’s they are aggro to everyone. This includes those lucky 
Dwarves and Erudites who have been walking around Sol A without a care in the 
world… I haven’t made up my mind if the Efreeti is aggro or not. Sometimes, he 
just sits there, sometimes, he attacks. His spawn rate is not the typical 20 
minutes. Ferrick stated that he missed a round, putting him on a 40 minute spawn 
cycle, but whenever I timed his spawn, it seemed a little more random (between 
35 and 55 mins). Like all the other spawns in Sol A has a place-holder, another 
Blazing elemental.</P><B>
<P>The Goblin Captain</B>: The Captain 
is very close to the Efreeti. But be warned it’s a very difficult pull. Go back 
up the ramp out of the Efreeti pit and into the room with the table. Take the 
door to your right (the one you haven’t used yet). You’ll come into a room with 
2 more Goblins and a fireplace in it. This is a pretty good place to set up base 
camp. Kindle will wander right through this room and you’re close enough to pull 
from the Captain’s room and the Efreeti pit. There’s another door on the other 
side of the fireplace. Take that door, you’re now in a short hall. Open the door 
at the end you will see a room with 3 doors, there are 2 goblins guarding the 
middle door. This is the Captain’s room. Pulling is difficult because you can’t 
pull only those 2. When you pull either of them, you will pull 2-4 more. 2 or 3 
from the Captain’s room plus there’s usually a lurker behind the left door who 
will come, too. So now you have to fight 5 or 6 goblins. During the fight one of 
the of the spawns in the fireplace rooms will pop up and sometimes kindle (or 
his placeholder) will wander in. Compound that with the Goblins proclivity to 
run and you have all the makings for a disaster. Think: ENCHANTER or BARD… Once 
you’ve broken the spawn it’s much easier of course. It’s worth it because the 
Captain drops two very nice items: Charred Boots are common (AC6 +3 AGI +5 vs 
Fire and Poison) and Charred Gauntlets (AC7 +3 DEX +5 INT) rare. When you 
consider how few good gloves and boots there are (I got my snakeskin gloves at 
level 10) then you’ll realize how truly special the Captain is.</P>
<P>By my count, for gloves there are 4 choices after snakeskin: 
plate (steel or bronze), Charred, Ro or Darkmail. Boots are worse, plate, 
Dwarven workboots or Ro. Considering that he ALWAYS drops boots or gloves and 
that a party in their high 20’s to low 30’s I don’t understand why he isn’t 
camped far more often. I was offered 2000pp in trade for my gloves (2 foreman 
tunic –800, 2 kobold boots -400, 2 obsidian hoops -500 and chitin 
greaves-300).</P>
<P>I have not met anyone who has seen charred leggings or 
charred bracers. Ferrick reported that he had heard rumors that they were 
available. It would be fairly sweet to find.</P><B>
<P>MINING MELATITE</B>:<I> </I>Now the 
question all the Paladins (and Shadowknights and Rangers to a lesser degree) 
will want answered: what drops Melatite? I have been told models MB, MC, and XC, 
XB and the minors drop Melatite. No one seems to know. The best answer is to 
kill as many employees and mechanicals of the Solusek Mining Company as possible
(Verant really doesn’t want us to roleplay do they?). It’s very rare, so don’t 
expect to get much. Camping Gabbie, Captain and the EXG while trying to get 
Melatite makes the most sense. A few things to note. I have heard rumors that 
melatite drops more often outside the Castle proper (near the "L-bridge" but I 
have my doubts. Also, killing the gnomish minors gives you a much bigger faction 
hit than killing the mechanicals. I would avoid killing the minors and conjurers 
if I could<I>.</I></P>
<P>To get to the Gnome Castle and find Melatite. Backtracking 
to the L-bridge, go over the bridge and continue on, you’ll come to a swinging 
pendulum (its only for looks, it won’t actually hurt you). Keep going and you 
will come to a larger room with a large pool of lava. Follow the path to the 
left and you will see the Castle. You will have to jump into and swim (you’re 
given a waiver for rule # 6 this one time) a very small section of lava. If you 
do this quickly you won’t even take the usual 40 points of lava damage. It’s not 
really dangerous, but it’s fun to watch people do for the first time.</P>
<P>After you negotiate the lava (the first time you’ll be 
breathing kinda hard, but it wasn’t that bad, was it?) you will come to two 
drawbridges. The one on the right is the one we want. The left leads you to the 
doorway back by the secret door that leads to the Goblin Foreman room. I have 
not met anyone who has found anything particularly noteworthy on this side of 
the Castle.</P>
<P>Inside the castle is essentially one long hallway. Follow 
the hall until you come to a set of steps going down. Keep walking (well run – 
does anyone walk in Norrath?) we’ll come back later. Eventually the hall 
dead-ends at an opening with some lava. Across which you can see another 
drawbridge. There is a secret room (closet more like) with a lever a little bit 
behind you. It’s hard to see, just turn around and run along the right wall and 
you will run into it. Over the drawbridge are more Gnomes and their mechanical 
friends. It’s a hard place to describe and I’m not going to try. There are 4 
secret doors in this area. They all lead to the same room. Inside there are 6 
Gnomes, one of them is a wanderer. The wandering Gnome is the placeholder for 
<B>the Lava Elemental</B> (drops the Runed Lava Pendant, 5AC +5Str +5 Fire, I’ve 
been told his common drop is a healing potion, I have yet to confirm this). This 
room is tough. When you attack any of the gnomes they will all attack you. I 
think they will attack you if you attack the Lava Elemental (I think he’s 
aggro). I’ve been told level 50 players get experience from the Elemental, so 
beware. The Runed Lava Pendant is pretty darn nice.</P>
<P>Going back down the hall to the stairs, go down. At the 
bottom you will find a button and a door. To open the door you push the button. 
It locks behind you so don’t go in unless you want to. You go through a hall, a 
door and are in a small courtyard with a reddish tint. There is a secret room in 
here with a button on the wall. It opens the door that locked behind you… When 
you leave the courtyard you now find yourself in a small hallway with 2 doors 
and a portcullis. The first door has the Gnomish Vendor. He sells the Bag of the 
Tinkerers. It sells for around between 5250 and 7000pp. Buy me one, OK? I use 
him to sell FS and other goodies. People in Sol B use him too. I have found some 
very nice items for sale here (like medium Bronze Tunics and a Savant Cap.) 
Buying an item is a good way to get rid of excess copper silver and gold. Or you 
can just leave monk droppings all over the place, but I hate a messy dungeon. If 
only he sold food and drink (the gypsy camp in Lava Storm is the closest place I 
know for that). When he stops selling to you it’s time to go back to Sol B and 
whack Kobolds.</P>
<P>The next door is where <B>Gabbie Mardoddle</B> spawns. 
Gabbie’s rare drop is the uber-rare, Molten Cloak (4AC +4 WIS and INT – watch 
the spell-casters drool). Gabbie’s common drop is the Mithril Quill, a 4 dmg 19 
dly +20 HP piercing weapon (wow! /em dripping sarcasm). She spawns behind the 
desk. Gabbie is a caster and can do a TON of damage in a small amount of time. 
There are 2 other Gnomes in the room with her. They will attack when you start 
attacking Gabbie (or the place-holder) so be prepared for a fight. If she has 
the quill you will see it. It looks like a dagger… <B>Captain Bipnipple</B>, or 
his place-holder, will wander in and stand next to Gabbie. He’ll join in the 
fray as well, so I advice you kill him first. You can find a few spots to fight 
him while he’s alone fairly easily (like the courtyard with the reddish tint) if 
you follow him. Captain Bipnipple drops the Gnomish Environmental suit (not sure 
what the other drop is).</P>
<P>There’s one more NPC to camp while your mining for Melatite: 
the <B>Clockwork Model EXG</B>. She drops the Charred Guardian Shield (10AC +9 
WIS – druids and clerics love it) as her common drop and the Charred Guardian 
Breastplate (16AC +3 STR +6 STA - LORE ITEM – looks great too) is the rare drop 
(which is fine since the shield is so much more valuable). The EXG is a large 
female mechanical. You can see the shield if she has it. To find her go through 
the portcullis outside Gabbie’s room. You are in a big courtyard at the front of 
the Castle, now. There’s only one path, follow it. Continue cross two bridges 
(more lava). After the second bridge you’ll come to a small room with 2 
mechanicals. The EXG wanders between the portcullis this room (she and her 
place-holders are the only employees that wander in this area). She’s very touch 
to kill, being 100% resistant to magic (you can cast cancel magic on her). 
Nearby Gnomish Conjurer’s will buff and heal her, so find a nice secluded place 
to fight and tell your casters to med. I’ve killed her twice, a couple of 
healers and a couple of tanks can take her down around level 30. Like most of 
the mobs in Sol A she has a 20 minute spawn cycle and has place holders (the 
ones that wander along her path).</P>
<P>This is the end of the Gnome area. Continuing past that room 
with 2 gnome mechanicals that the EXG wanders to and you’ll go up some stairs 
(it turns left) and eventually the hall will end. You have to take a left or 
right here. (if you look to your right you will see some nasty looking spikes 
(like the swinging pendulum it doesn’t hurt, it’s just for looks) you will also 
see Goblins again.</P>
<P>If you take the right, towards the there is a doorway to 
your left BEFORE you get to the spikes, TAKE IT. If you continue on there are 
two traps past the spikes that drop you into the pit with the blazing elementals 
and the Reckless Efreeti. I only had to do that once to learn, I never go past 
the spikes now. You will find yourself on a ledge with a door and a single 
goblin. This is the door/ledge that leads to the Reckless Efreeti (the one you 
find Singe on a lot).</P>
<P>Well that’s a full circle. Time to go explore the Goblin 
Stronghold.</P><B>
<P>THE STRONGHOLD</B>: OK, you’ve 
explored the rest of the Goblin areas around the castle. You’ve gotten a few 
good items (probably a Foreman’s tunics at least) and you’re ready to go fight 
the Goblins on their home ground. Be warned the goblins in the Stronghold are 
tougher. There are very few Youngs and Cinders. If you venture in far enough you 
will see Solusek Goblins, and these guys are nasty, especially the casters. So, 
go back to the ledge. In front of you is a small pit-like area. Take the stairs 
or jump down. The door in front of you is the entrance to the Stronghold. Enter 
and you will be in a short hall with a door at the end. Go through and you will 
find yourself in a room with a portcullis there are 4 goblins in here, 2 near 
the door and 2 behind the portcullis. You will usually have to fight all 4 in 
the same pull. After the portcullis there are 2 doors, one on the left and one 
on the right. Take the left one. (if you find a secret door that leads back to 
the ledge, turn around, I didn’t mean that one, you have to go through the 
portcullis before you take the left).</P><B>
<P>Drunkedness in the Stronghold: </B>I 
had never heard that Goblins were big drinkers… The bar is very popular with 
players, certainly. The <B>Goblin Bartender</B> drops Drakeskin arms (rare) and 
Drakeskin leggings (Enchanters love the leggings: AC5 +5 DEX +5 CHA). Getting 
there is a bit of risk. Go straight you will go up some stairs and eventually 
come to a door. The bar is behind that door. There will be several goblins on 
the stairs getting to the bar. I always pull them back to the portcullis room. 
When you get to bar there are 3 goblins there. The bartender spawns behind the 
bar (gasp!). There are two rooms off of the bar. The one to the left (when you 
enter the bar) is a storeroom. There are 3 goblins here. To the right there is 
another room with 2 small rooms adjoining it. These rooms have pallets and 
appear to be where the goblins go to sleep it off. One of these side rooms is 
where the <B>Goblin Drunkard </B>spawns. I think it’s the room in the back. I 
cannot confirm this, as I have never seen the Drunkard. Close by is the <B>High 
Goblin Shaman. </B>I understand that he drops the (Glowing Stone Band: +2 AC. 
Serpent Sight) as his common drop. Considering all the people who are up in arms 
about the loss of DE vision with the loss of the Mask of the Deceiver I am very 
surprised that this item in not more heavily camped. Being a Dwarf I have no 
basis of comparison here. But if you want infravision here it is. His other drop 
I have been told is a Platinum Totem. No idea what it does.</P>
<P>Finding the high shaman is not easy. Much of the Stronghold 
is maze of confusing turns and corridors. I’ll try and give directions, but 
don’t blame me if you get lost. Starting at the portcullis in the Goblin 
Stronghold, go through and take the door on left (towards the bar). Halfway up 
stairs, turn right and go through that door. There are 2 spawns in this room. 
Take the door ahead of you (not the one on the right). Follow the hall, it turns 
left. At the end of hall, past one door on right with one gob in, turn right. Go 
all way to end of hall (there are two rooms in this hall with one spawn in 
each), at the end of hall there should be a red devil head. The door on right of 
head opens into a room with 1 goblin. There is 1 door leading out of this room, 
to a corridor, there’s 1 door directly opposite. Down and to the left there's a 
door. This goes into a small room with lots of books around the wall. There are 
3 spawn points to the left of the door. This is the Shaman’s room.</P>
<P><b>QUEST INFO:</b> There is a new NPC in Sol A, 
<B>Lynada</B>, a Dark Elf mage. She may, or may not, have replaced the Shaman. 
Apparently she is part of some new quest (drops the sparkle-purse that 
<B>Kizdean Gix</B> in West Commons used to have). You can hear her casting when 
you’re at the bar. If you figure out what the sparkle purse is for let us know, 
it appears to be part of a paladin quest (dare I say it… No, won’t jinx it). Why 
do I think it is part of a paladin’s quest? Because of the appearance of the 
"Sparkling Sapphire&quot; – NO DROP - LORE - PAL ONLY All races – at <B>Noresa 
Sparkle’s</B>, a gem merchant in West Commons… Lynada is in the center of this 
room I have been told. She is around level 28-32.</P>
<P>Back to the portcullis, if you take the right door the hall 
turns left. There is a secret door here and you can continue forward. It doesn’t 
matter which way you go, straight or left, both eventually lead you to the 
Goblin King. If you go through the secret door you take a left and go down a 
long hall and come to a door. Open the door and you will be in a small chamber 
with 2 others doors. The one on your left leads to a small bedroom, the other 
leads to the throne room. Surprisingly the <B>Goblin King </B>spawns in the 
bedroom. His majesty commonly drops the Ring of the Goblin Lords (AC4 +3 Int +3 
Str). His rare drop is the Scepter of Flame (Damage 7, Delay 29, +15 Mana, +5 
Fire and Magic), a nice weapon, but I was hoping for better. If you don’t use 
the secret door (meaning you took a left) you will go down a shorter hall. 
There’s a room on your left with the Goblin Merchant in it. He doesn’t drop 
anything memorable, but if you have good faction or can sneak you can sell to 
him (he sells water and bandages as well). A little farther the hall ends and 
you have 2 doors, left or right. The King is beyond the right one. You will go 
through a small room with 2 goblins first and you’ll be back in the throne 
room.</P>
<P>Back out of the throne room and go to the hall with 2 doors 
(you took the right door). If you take the left door and then continue to your 
right (there’s a door there soon see some some jail cells. At the end of the 
hall there’s a door (not a cell), inside you will find the <B>Inferno Goblin 
Torturer</B>. The few times I hunted him he dropped a Turquoise Eyepatch (+2 Str 
+2 Int +2 Cha) which isn’t that wonderful for melee types, but enchanters seem 
to like them. Since I’ve never seen him drop anything else, I have to assume 
this is his common drops . I have yet to meet anyone who knows what the rare 
drop is… I plan to find out soon.</P>
<P>There is a zone to Sol B in the stronghold, but it’s fairly 
deep and as I’ve said navigating in the stronghold is pretty difficult, so I’m 
not going to try to lead you there.</P><B>
<P>STRATEGY</B>: Solusek A is a great 
place for both loot and experience. If it is experience you crave, I would 
suggest you head to the Stronghold as soon as possible. The loot is not as 
great, (you’ll still get mad amounts of Fine Steal, just not as many rare 
items). I have seen some people get crazy experience there. Start in the 
portucullis room and pull nearby goblins. Once you find you can handle that move 
on to the bar. After that it’s time to tackle the Solusek Goblins and the Goblin 
King. A small well-organized group can utilize the secret hall and camp the 
Goblin king fairly easily. Larger groups should camp the Throne room and pull 
there (IMHO).</P>
<P>There is less experience to be had on the other side of the 
dungeon, but I think the great loot and fun is well worth it. I started on the 
stairs (bad idea – which I document – see rules #3, #1, #2 and #6) and quickly 
moved to the goblins on the ledge (pulling them to the Sol B room). When I could 
get good groups together we would move on to the Predator/Foreman rooms. (I have 
made several camps of the bar, but I find those groups have to be much more 
disciplined.) When that became easy we moved into the Reckless Efreeti area. I 
found I was able to successfully solo the ledge goblins around level 25 and the 
Predator room around level 30. I still have trouble with soloing the Foreman 
room.</P>
<P>A good group can camp the room above the Efreeti pit, 
pulling the Efreeti, the Goblin Captain room and several surrounding rooms as 
well. Be forewarned pulling the Captain’s room usually results in 4 or 5 goblins 
(inferno’s and fires).</P>
<P>At 31 I have several options. I can solo the 
Predator/Foreman rooms. I can get a group to fight in the 
Captain/Kindle/Efreeti/Singe area. With a good group I can mine for melatite 
among the gnomes. I do this by alternating between Gabbie and the EXG. Or I can 
go after the Throne room and hunt Solusek Goblins. The bar is another 
choice.</P>
<P>Well, that pretty much covers the whole place. Good hunting 
and if you find some charred leggings or bracers post something on the Paladin’s 
of Norrath and tell us how. Also, if you out anything more about <B>Lynada 
</B>let us know.</P>
<P><i>"Another thing to note about the High shaman room, is that 
the table blocks Line of Sight. So you can go into one corner (to the left of 
the high shaman), and neither Lynada or the other spawn in the room can see you… 
You can do the same thing in the bar. If you fight the bartender behind the bar, 
the other mobs will not assist (unless he moves past the end of the 
bar)."</i></P>
