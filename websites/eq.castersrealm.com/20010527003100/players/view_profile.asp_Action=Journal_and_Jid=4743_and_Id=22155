  <tr><td class='db'> </td></tr>
  <tr><td class='db'>The lonely figure was running quickly across the snow-draped landscape. He was bleeding from numerous wounds and looked to not have much fight left in him. A tear through his Ivy Etched Leggings was pumping blood at an alarming rate, and a bluish tinted Orc was giving hot pursuit, with an icy looking longsword in hand.  Mind numbing with cold, Donner Truefletch tried his last ditch effort to avoid a quick trip to Tunare … he’d attempt to call up the power of the local and strange flora to entwine the orc in a mess of roots. He turned and began the casting, but to no avail – the Orc Legionaire resisted the futile attempt.
<P>
Suddenly from behind him Donner heard a familiar laugh coupled with a wolf’s howl. Somehow Wallach had found Donner in this strange icy continent known as Velious and was once again helping the head strong ranger out of a tight spot. His companion spirit Xarn ran into a full melee with the orc, while Wallach used his spiritual energies to heal Donner of many of his wounds – soon he was back in the thick of the fray, stabbing and slashing with his two Ykesha imbued weapons. It only took a few moments for the tide of battle to turn and soon the orc was running from them – Donner put a quick stop to that with a spell of snaring.
<P>
“Hail and well met brother-friend! Had Xarn and I not been wandering nearby looking for a rumored orc keep, things might have gone badly for you.” Wallach was a tall barbarian from Halas, towering over Donner’s five and a half foot frame by well more than a foot. His power lay less in his arms and more in his mana however, though many had fallen to both.
<P>
“Aye brother mine, twould likely have been some time afore I could have finished the creature off rigt proper. But make no mistake, I had him just where I wanted him almost.” A wry smile crossed Donner’s thin mouth, showing the dry sarcasm he so enjoyed. “In fact, you have stolen a kill from the hunter, and now I shall exact punishments by looting this corpse!”
<P>
When he started dressing down the dead orc he noticed the craftsmanship of the leggings and considered his own damaged pair. They looked about the right size, and the Orc had been unusually magic resistant….”Wallach – come here a second and look at these chain legs, they seem unusually fine for an orc, perhaps to the point of holding an enchantment.” After a brief inspection, Wallach declared that he felt that they were likely magical in nature and that Donner should try them on, stating “I’m tired o’ looking at yer skinny elf legs anyway.”
<P>
“These don’t look to be yer Crushbone variety orc Donner, what can you tell me of them?” Wallach had a dull gleam in his glacier blue eyes and Donner could tell what it was he was thinking.  “Oh no, they certainly are not – they are much more powerful and intelligent, though they are equally cruel and evil. They have set up a keep nearby and I tracked a patrol to it – they kill the Icy Dwarves … the Coldain they are called.” The half-elf said the last with a just-hushed-enough whisper to add the dramatic pause he needed.
<P>
“Then I shall hunt them to the end o’ their days. The Tribunal sits in judgement and has found these orcs in great need of extermination. Come brother show me this keep and we shall wreak holy vengance upon these wretches!” Wallach was worked into a red faced rage now, and his Barbarian Spiritists Hammer was gleaming with an unnatural light, as if in was a sentient thing desiring to please its master – a thought which had crossed Donner’s mind before.
<P>
<B>***</B>
<P>
Wallach and Donner had befriended two of Norrath’s most legendary figures: Baram Windrunner and Thorian Thundermaul – in fact, twas Baram and his efforts that had won Wallach the hammer he now bore, and Donner’s Ivy Tunic was begot with much help from Brell’s mightiest paladin. If there was one thing that neither could abide, it was the slaughter of dwarven folk – Thorian himself had long fought a crusade to stop the senseless slaughter of the Butcherblock dwarves, and few dared to raise the ire of Thorian and his God. Tales are still told of the time that Thorian punched a dwarf hunting druid so hard that Tantor Everhot himself had to forge the wood-elf new metal teeth so that he could talk again.
<P>
Baram Windrunner on the other leaf (as the saying goes amongst the JaggedPine) was a quiet half-elf who had helped to show Donner the ways of the forest soon after the BlackBurrow gnolls had captured his mother, Cendral. In fact, Baram helped Donner acquire his Short Sword of Morin with which the two, with help from Wallach, used to great advantage to mount a rescue mission to wrest Cendral from a her High Shaman captor, deep in BlackBurrow. The mission was a failure as a pact had been struck between BlackBurrow and Crushbone, via the spies of Neriak ‘tis told, and Cendral had been transferred to Emporer Crush himself – a story for another time perhaps.
<P>
Either way, both Wallach and Donner had sworn to uphold the ideals of their friends, and that dictated the death of the Ry’Gorr legions here in Velious. Chances are, they may have hunted the orcs anyway, their wanton destruction of the ice clad forests and the valuable experience gained in fighting them alone was worth their time. But the senseless slaughter of the dwarves, coupled with the possibility of a tie with Crushbone settled it.
<P>
<B>***</B>
<P>
It was dark about the keep and a thread of smoke plied its way through a hole in the roof. Donner had been pulling single orcs from the keep all night, using his stealth as a tracker and his Harmony spell. He and Wallach had killed literally dozens of Centurions and Legionaires over the last week, coupled with a few mystics and a blacksmith who had dropped a most incredible hammer that Wallach now held. A pall of quiet had settled on the keep this eve though, and both Ranger and Shaman knew that they were expected, and that something dangerous lay in wait for them.
<P>
Donner quickly cast a spell of Camoflauge upon himself as he heard the grunting speech of orcs from a room within the keep. Cautiously he slid around the corner and peeked in, the sight caused him to blanch. There were two humungous orcs within – both seeming to be part of some elite honor guard for the oracle which they surrounded. Donner was no slouch with arrow and blade, having felled many enemies, but he knew all three of the creatures could easily kill him – the question was weather or not he and Wallach working together could take one out.
<P>
He backed off a bit and went back to the door. One of the guards eventually left the room on some errand for the oracle. As he walked past Donner, who was still hidden via his dwimorcraft, the JaggedPine ranger reared up from behind and attempted to slit the orcs throat with his Dragonhorn Ykesha. Too late, he realized that the orc was much smarter than anticipated, he had heard Donner and grasped his sword arm in a vice like grip. “Now little one, we’ll see if yous tasty sweet like dorf flesh!” The rancid creatures breath exploded from him however as Donner’s knee met the orcs crotch. In a fluid motion, he brought his short sword around and sliced off the orcs tongue – effectively silencing and enraging the creature beyond the point of reason. 
<P>
He started the quarter mile run back to where Wallach waited, easily outdistancing the orc in these woods, but stopping and shooting an occasional arrow to keep the creatures ire up. When he arrived back at camp, Wallach was ready and the battle was joined. Even with all of their efforts and the help of a guardian wolven spirit the battle was close – the orc had an incredible amount of stamina, rivaled only by the power of his blows. Normally a battle lasts but seconds, this one waged for ten and two minutes, and both were weary afterwards. They had picked up a chain coif from the orc and it now adorned Donner’s head, matching the greeves he already wore.
<P>
“There’s two more – one like this fella and an Oracle, he’s who these guys seem to answer too.” Donner was relating the layout to Wallach who, tactically, was simply brilliant. They were laying down their plans when from off to their right, they could hear another group joining in battle. They quickly snuffed out their camp fire and headed off in that direction. Within moments they stumbled upon a raging battle, involving two additional Shadow Tribe members: Xylen the Enchanter and Kurullisi the Shaman. They had brought the additional two orcs from the Keep and were hard pressed to keep themselves alive. Running into the glade, Wallach cast a rooting spell upon the Legoinaire and Donner waded in to help with the Oracle. Though the battle was certain to be tough, with four Tribesmen present, the orcs had little real chance – until all Hell broke loose.
<P>
Wallach went down to one knee, crying in pain and losing the concentration to keep the orc rooted. Red blood spilled from his back and poured his life out onto the snow of the accursed ice continent. The Legionaire, free from his spell based bonds descended upon Donner and Kurullisi with a vengance bordering on madness. The Oracle, looking to be almost dead began casting a spell of Gating, hoping to reach the keep in time to summon reinforcements.
<P>
Instincts kicking in, Donner did the only thing he could, he taunted the legoinaire to stay occupied on him in hopes that either Kurullisi or Wallach could root the orc once again, or bash the oracle to keep him from gating. He threw a quick thrust with his Dragonhorn into the Oracle’s shoulder and took his short sword and sliced down the cheek of the other orc, yelling “There ya go ya goblin-lover, maybe that’ll improve yer chances with the ladies!” It was at this point that Kurullisi went down also to one knee, two dagger holes in his back and a madly grinning dwarf standing over him.
<P>
There are three rules in the world of Norrath that should always be followed. The first is don’t look for trouble if you don’t want to find it. The second is never tell an Orc that they are on a level with goblins – Goblins are too stupid to know it as an insult, but Orcs – well they don’t seem to like it too much. The third rule, is never backstab a Shadow Tribe member in front of his brothers or sisters, unless your prepared to finish the job. All three rules had just been broken in the space of about eight seconds.
<P>
Donner threw a sharp kick into the Oracle’s knee, interrupting the casting and rolled between the Legionaire’s legs, throwing a quick thrust into the creature’s thigh, and grinning as the weapon processed its effect for a more devastating blow than could normally be achieved. He rolled up to both knees and parried a thrust from the dwarven rouge’s dagger, anger burned in the ranger’s eyes and the dwarf could see it and returned the hatred. The others were not idle either.
<P>
Wallach had healed himself and had rerooted the melee based orc. Kurullisi and Xylen had moved in on the Oracle, who was once again trying to gate back to the keep. Donner’s weapons were a blur as he parried, thrust, blocked and riposted with fury. The rouge however was Donner’s equal in combat thus far, and he had an obviously powerful enchanment on his dagger – as it was blindingly fast and terribly wounding. With blinding speed the jagged blade crisscrossed across Donner’s face leaving two streams of blood upon his visage.
<P>
Not to be outdone, the half-elf faked a thrust with his off hand, and then riposted the parry, and struck four successive blows, mostly falling harmlessly upon the armour of the dwarf, but he also processed his weapons twice – draining enough life away to leave the rouge with fear filled eyes.  With a thunderous thrust and a concusive spell Xylen and Kurullisi had just felled the Oracle. Wallach was laying spell after spell upon the legoinaire, while keeping an eye on his brother, and throwing him a heal or a buff every now and then.
<P>
The Legionaire was in trouble and he knew it, he finally broke the root spell and started to slowly run back to the keep for aid. A rift of cold slammed into him as Wallach’s Barbarian Spiritists Hammer crashed upon the broken creatures back – snapping his spine with a sickening crunch. In the meantime, Kurullisi and Xylen were helping to debuff the dwarf who had caused so many problems and heal Donner. Going toe-to-toe with the rouge, Donner would have been defeated almost certainly, but with the support of his guild, he was winning the fight – though even so it was close. That dagger was like lightning! Eventually, The group overcame the rouge, and Donner picked up this dirk of the traitor dwarf as his prize.
<P>
The battle was hard fought and hard won, but the Tribe had indeed emerged victorious. One thing was certain however – this strange new continent held many dangers, and perhaps treasures as well, which would require all the discipline and skill of its would be conquerers to win past. A cold sun was just now setting on a cold land, and the four companions all thought long and hard about the recent battle, and how much tougher it had been than they expected.
