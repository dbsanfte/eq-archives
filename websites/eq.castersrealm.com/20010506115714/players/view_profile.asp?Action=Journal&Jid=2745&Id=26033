  <tr><td class='db'>The furthest back I can remember was living with my mother in the woods on the border of the West Commandlands and Kithicor. I must have been very young then, because I only remember bits and pieces of my life. There is one thing that no matter how hard I tried I could never get out of my head. One morning I awoke to a beautiful sunrise and was ready to start another day. When I awoke I could feel something wasn't right, my mother was nowhere to be seen. I went out into the kitchen thinking she could be making breakfast for me, but she wasn't there; the feeling that something wasn't right started to grow inside me, and I began to worry. Going out into the yard I saw her in the field picking the vegetables. 
"Heh, she just got up early today to get some work done that's all", I thought to myself. 
I walked back into the house, but the feeling that something was awry was still with me and I did not understand why. Beginning to get myself something to eat I heard a scream outside from the yard. 
"That's where mom is!" I thought.
I rushed to the window to see a HUGE beast! A troll or an ogre, I have heard of these beasts from my mother. She had told me enough times to keep my distance, but this time they were here at my house! This beast was cloaked in Black Plate armor and had a black sword. I could feel an evil emanating from the sword, and it scared me. My mother didn't look scared, and said: 
"If you dare to touch me the Paladins of Marr shall hunt you down and kill you"
He replied with a laugh
"The paladins of Marr are weak, and do not scare me woman. Now is your time to die, by order of Sir Lucan you have not paid your taxes and I am to come back with your head."
Immediately after he spoke those words he swung at my mother, and loped her head clean off. I was shocked and fell over crying, unable to contain myself from what I had just seen. I heard the beast man shouting to check the house and I ran as fast as I could into the woods. Soon enough I was lost in the woods and had no choice but to stop and take in all that was around me. Nighttime was soon to be upon me and I felt the presence of the undead ahead, it was a presence that made me feel uneasy and I wished to get away from it, so I turned the other way and went back toward the cabin very carefully just in case. 
Nighttime had come upon me and I found myself back at the cabin. The cabin was destroyed, and where my mother once lay was now a rotting corpse…. Once again I sat down and began to cry. What was I to do now? How could I go on? I would have sat there forever most likely but my mothers headless corpse began to move. I faltered and fell back frightened almost too much to move. The corpse began to come toward me; even without a head it felt my life essence and came to take my soul and force me to live a life walking the earth as an undead just as it has been doomed to do. I did not know what to do, or where to go. I was too scared to move. Then I felt a very powerful presence and saw a man in shiny armor standing before me. He began to whisper some words, and I was able to make them out. "May the Might of Mithainal Marr shine down upon you and with great force send your soul to rest."
And with that I saw a huge flash of light and my once mother now zombie was gone and a pile of clothing and flesh lay on the grass in my yard. I actually felt relieved, for somehow I knew my mother's soul was freed. He came to me and helped me up.
"What is your name young one?"
"My name is Reylos kind sir, that was my mother once" I sobbingly said almost making no sense.
"Tell me everything that happened Reylos, perhaps I can help you"
So I told him about how the Beast man had come and how I felt the evil in the sword, and about how I ran away into the woods. When he heard about how I felt the evil in the sword he relaxed a bit and looked a little more Interested.
"There is nothing for you here now, come with me and I shall show you the Hall of Truth where I reside. You were very fortunate I was coming out to see a friend of mine in these lands, else you may have been in for some trouble"
We traveled for most of the night, and I began to grow tired. The man noticed this and picked me up with ease.
"We will be there shortly do not worry."
I felt safe with him, and fell asleep.
When I awoke I doubled back for a second, not knowing where I was. The man in the armor was by my side, and I relaxed some.
"You have been sleeping for 2 days Reylos, we had our clerics here just in case. I was beginning to get worried. I am glad you are awake. When you feel ready I shall show you around my home"
I felt my strength had returned and told him I was fine, so he started to show me around. We entered a room where we looked over a large open area. There were young warriors training in the field with one man looking over them all.
"Reylos, this is Valeron Dushire, my mentor."
Valeron looked at me and smiled.
"So Morden are you bringing more people to help in the fight?"
He then laughed a bit, but it was in a very kind manner.
I was introduced and was a little overwhelmed. I felt such strong powers in these people, but these powers helped me instill confidence in myself somehow, and I felt powerful just being with them. Morden told Valeron about what happened to me, and Valeron offered to let me stay in the Hall of Truth. Morden said he would teach me about Mithanial Marr if I so desired. I thanked both Morden and Valeron, and seeing as how I had nowhere else to go I agreed to stay at the Hall of Truth.</p>

<p>One day I was sent to buy some food and drinks for the trainers at the fort. I went into West Freeport, and not knowing where exactly to go I walked into the Freeport Militia house hoping to get some directions. As I walked through I felt all the guards watching me. And I felt an evil power coming from one of the rooms. I was curious, and a little afraid, because the last time I felt a power like this was when my mother was killed. I stayed at the door and listened carefully. I heard a man talking of people in the West Commanlands not paying taxes, and how he has sent his allies the trolls to take care of it.</P>
"If they do not pay my taxes, they are not under my protection". 
The others laughed when they heard the news. 
"That's great Sir Lucan", 
"What a great idea Sir Lucan", 
"The people will never refuse to pay now Sir Lucan".
I knew what they were talking about! This was the man responsible for my mothers' death and he was the one who ruined my life! Sir Lucan!! I would not forget that name. I ran back to the Hall of Truth and told Valeron what I heard.
"Hmm…I guess it is time you learned who Sir Lucan is and what he has done to us. Reylos, you have been given a gift. Marr shines brightly upon you, and I feel you will be able to become a powerful warrior and an asset to our cause if trained properly. Will you join us in the Hall of Truth Reylos, and begin your training?"
From day one I knew these people were people I could trust. After all that I have seen, and all that I knew, I felt it was the right decision, and I agreed to train with Valeron at the Hall of Truth. I learned of Honor, Valor, Forgiveness, I learned who Sir Lucan was and how he was once a Holy Knight of Freeport before he turned and betrayed his own Paladin brothers. And I learned how Norrath was filled with beings of hate and I was to look out for them, and be wary of their powers, for most likely they will wish me dead.</p>
<p>By my 9th season with the Holy Knights I began to notice I could manipulate the world around me in some ways, drawing forth my inner strength to cause various effects. Valeron told me this was normal of the followers of Marr, it was Mithanial Marr's gift to all his followers. This is to help them survive in the world. I could heal my wounds and the wounds of others, and cure some minor diseases and poisons. With my new knowledge I went out into the east commanlands to fight against the Orcs that plagued the lands. There was an encampment or orcs deep into the forest where many other dangers lurked. Eventually I reached this camp, dodging all other enemies in my path. There was a young girl there already, dressed almost in nothing and fighting with a burning hatred in her eyes. She was a dark elf, and although I knew very little about the clan, I knew they hated humans and the paladins, so I tried to keep my distance. They were overcoming her, there were 2 and she was only 1. The largest orc saw me and came towards me ready to put an end to my life. He fought well, but Morden and Valeron taught me well, and although I was hurt, I managed to fend him off, and began a quick tend to my wounds before I looked toward the girl again. I could not stop staring at the young girl there; I was totally intrigued by her. She looked to be the same age as me, and fought with great force and power. By the looks of things she would have easily defeated the 1 orc if not for the other who had joined the battle before. She fought recklessly, but with much heart. The orc was winning, slowly wearing her down, I wondered if I should interfere, because I did not know if she wanted my help, and she said nothing to me.
"What are you doing standing there" she said, "How about a little help eh?"
She had an accent I recognized from a long time ago, but I couldn't put my finger on it.
I had tried to keep my distance before, but now I knew what I had to do. I called upon the power of Marr, and as she felt my healing touch she faltered for a bit, but seeing she was restored she began fighting and together we quickly defeated the orc.
"Hmm…so you're one of those Paladins huh? I've heard of your kind…. why did you help me, you could have easily rid the world of another evil, yet you stayed and watched over me"
I thought for a second, remembering the words Morden said to me as a young squire. "There is much evil in this world Reylos, but never forget, it is the individual that is evil, it has nothing to do with their race, clan, profession, or even what God they follow. Sir Lucan once followed the same God as you and I, yet he is one of the most evil people in the entire world. If you can live by this rule you will not falter, you will become strong and perhaps one day we can change all of Norrath"
So I told her of all I have learned, and how what I was after was much larger then the present, and I hoped to change the future of Norrath; how I wanted to end all hate in the realm, and restore everything to peace.
She laughed at me, saying peace will never come about, because people are too hard headed to accept it.
She looked me up and down, obviously sizing me up and finally said:
"My name is Arshesnaie, and you saved my life, therefore I am in your debt."
I began to find myself thinking more of Arshesnaie as the days went by, hoping I would see her again. I found myself going to that orc camp where we met looking for her. Perhaps we could fight together again soon.</p>

<p>Time went on, and I gained power refining my skill against the Orcs I was instructed to kill. Time and time again I met Arshesniae there, and together we were very powerful.
Every night when I had to leave for Freeport, and her for her home in Neriak she would say to me: "Even for a pale skin, you fight well Reylos, I shall see you tomorrow, and we shall continue our fight against these stupid creatures"
I felt good fighting with her, but I started to get curious about her past and why she chose to follow the God of Hate, 
"I would ask her tomorrow" 
I would say to myself as I went to sleep.</p>
