"Boggle the Warrior here has hunted in PoG. Why do you group with him?"<BR>
=====================================================<BR><BR>

Introduction<BR>
=========<BR><BR>

I have sometimes been asked, how do I decide whom Felishanna can and cannot group with. It has been observed that she has and continues to group with individuals who have reputedly done 'evil' things, such as kill druids or rangers or treants, or kill Elven guards, or even (sacrilidge that it be) hunt in the Plane of Tunare herself. How can I justify this, I have been asked. <BR><BR>

Since it is an valid question, this article covers my answer to this, for my character. The answer is not, as with most aspects of roleplaying in a massively multiplayer roleplaying game where most players do not roleplay, as straightforward as many non-roleplayers might think it might or should be, as you will see by reading on.<BR><BR>

Although normally calm, this article is written in a very assertive style for me. For the casual reader, please forgive the assertive nature, as this article is not only directed at the fellow roleplayer and the interested reader, but also at the intolerant individuals who are often ignorant of roleplay and take every opportunity they can to attack its practictioners. It is useful, I hope, for you to be able to see a robust defence of the most wonderful approach (in my opinion, naturally) to playing a roleplaying game like EverQuest.<BR><BR>

Disclamer<BR>
=======<BR><BR>

This part is particularly assertive, and deliberately so. It is aimed at people who attack roleplayers, or who attack my roleplayed character in particular, simply because of the roleplaying. I have little time for such intolerant people, but I will address the basic issue first to get it out of the way.<BR><BR>

As with ALL aspects of roleplaying, only the roleplayer gets to decide the rules for their character, not anyone else. If you don't like the rules or decisions one roleplayer makes for their character, that's fine, don't like them, you don't need to like them, find others to group with, they will not take offence. But do not expect them to change their playstyle because you say so, your disagreeing does not make you right, it only means you have a different view. This should not need to be said, but in my experience there are so many arrogant and intolerant players in the world of Norrath that immediately brand anyone who disagrees with them as being wrong, it is almost untrue. So if you are one of these arrogant people, you won't like what you are going to read anyway, and I do not play to please you in any case.<BR><BR>

This article does not state how any roleplayer should deal with issues like this. It only states how *I* deal with them. If you don't like the way I deal with them, yo uare free to play your character your way, and I'll play mine my way. As long as I stick to the rules that I set for myself, I am contented. I have failed sometimes (especially in my earlier levels before I had it all sorted out), but I try never to. The only thing that matters is self-consistency. Those who know me well will know I am frighteningly consistent, even to my own detriment, in many ways.<BR><BR>

A Little Knowledge<BR>
=============<BR><BR>

The first issue is ... wow the children's guide to roleplaying has to come out again ... the character and the player are two different things. Some people can never get past this point, and if you are one that can't, you are forever doomed to ignorance of the 'weird' ways of all roleplayers. Basically, in this context means, what the player knows the character does not necessarily know. In addition, what one character the player controls knows, another of their characters does not necessarily know.<BR><BR>

Add to this, in many cases there are many facts even the player does not know anyway. Who is Boggle the Warrior anyway? Even if I know him, how do I know what he has been up to in all the levels before I met him? Even if I do know because someone told me in ooc sense only, how would Felishanna know what he has been doing? The answer is, she wouldn't, of course.<BR><BR>

Then there are other kinds of knowledge. For example, do I, as player or character, know what PoG armour looks like? Answer .. I have no idea actually. In the same way, even after all the time I have spent playing EverQuest, I have almost no idea what shadowknights and necromancers can actually do. This is because, I try not to read anything on the web about the classes my main character will not interact with, it helps with the realism for me. Neither do I read about 'loot' drops from a place my main character would never hunt.<BR><BR>

More generally, I love to get the nice little new thing for beloved character every now and then, like everyone else (DOH! arn't I greedy? lol), but I'm not a big fan of the 'loot chase' like the greed-mongerers out there, so I don't really make note of what drops where when etc or what things look like. So even if someone were to show me some item, there's a pretty good chance two days later I've forgotten they've even shown me, never mind what it looks like.<BR><BR>

But this knowledge issue is only the tip of the iceberg. It covers all the cases of people who I do not know so well, whom my cleric might group with in Sebilis in a pick up group one day and not see again for a month or more. It does not address the main issue.<BR><BR>

Playing alongside Non-Roleplayers<BR>
=========================<BR><BR>

Playing in a ROLEPLAYING game (oh yes it is for me, whether you like it or not) where so many people do not even attempt to roleplay but (my opinion now) do things that are totally 'wrong' for the class they are playing is sometimes frustrating to me, but I have learned to, basically, ignore it. There is NOTHING I can do about it. It is something I learned very quickly, of course.<BR><BR>

If I could choose who populated Lanys-Norrath, and could dictate all characters must be roleplayed at all times, things would be very different. I would not need to modify the 'purist' roleplay path I would have preferred in any way. But this is not the case. I have to interact with non-roleplayers all the time. I have had to make allowances for this in my roleplay approach. These allowances I know inside out now, I've been playing them for 60 levels with Felishanna. <BR><BR>

To deal with this, I have developed a way of playing my character that is not perfect but which allows me to continue to play the way I want and still roleplay but without being forced into an unplayable position. The unplayable position is obvious. I could not set stupid rules for myself. Yes, I can refuse to group with evils. But no, I cannot possibly refuse to group with anyone who has ever grouped themselves with evils, that would leave me alone in Norrath. So I had to weave the oaths of my character into a playable state to allow for such as this.<BR><BR>

The justification to myself (I do not need to justify it to anyone else, I'm my own storyteller here) is that Felishanna is bound by a set of oaths but she does not consider others, even other High Elven clerics, to be bound by them as such, they have their own free will, and may (I said *MAY*) have their own, benign, motives for their choices. They must find their own path into Tunare's Light, and even if I think them misguided or wrong in some of their actions, unless I actually see them commit evil acts with my own eyes, or they come to me and tell me in their own words of their evil doings, I will not believe such, and will ignore any stories that suggest such as mere tittle-tattle (i.e. as the words of non-roleplayers trying to mess up a roleplayed character, I totally ignore it).<BR><BR>

The Balance of Playability vs Roleplay - Where *I* draw the Line<BR>
==============================================<BR><BR>

The key point here is, I draw this line for my character, not anyone else. Some would draw it in a different place, and I'd respect them for it as long as they kept to their own rules, as I do to mine. This is just where I draw it for Felishanna, and I stick to it like glue, come hell or high water.<BR><BR>

Fact 1: Most people do not roleplay continuously and consistently (>99%). Nothing wrong here, that's their choice.<BR><BR>

Fact 2: Most non-roleplayed characters will do 'evil' things at some time or another. Nothing wrong here, for the non-roleplayer, the 'evilness' of the act in a roleplay sense is irrelevant.<BR><BR>

Fact 3: I want to be able to group with others, not forever solo or be able group with the tiny handful of others who also roleplay strictly. Nothing wrong with this either, anyone but an idiot would understand this, I mean, who wants to play alone?<BR><BR>

So, how can I balance these facts?<BR><BR>

Well, this is how I have always done it. My rule for playing comes down to something very simple.<BR><BR>

If Felishanna sees (with her own eyes) another do a great act of evil, or if she did not see it but the character pushes their evil act in Felishanna's face (in an in-character sense), so to speak, e.g. boasting of how they killed some 'good' creature, or how they have hunted Tunare's creature on her own plane, they are doomed thereafter to evil status. This means, like evil classes/races, they will not be grouped with, assisted, rezzed, etcetera, until such a time as they manage to redeem themselves in her eyes, if ever they achieve this (unlikely for a non-roleplayer).<BR><BR>

If Felishanna did not actually witness the event, and the character does NOT push it in her face, but does not mention it, and behaves toward Felishanna as that character 'should' (in her opinion, naturally), then, simply put, she will act as if she does not know the background of this character (even if I the player know).<BR><BR>

This is the balance of playability.<BR><BR>

Hypocracy - The Fool's Cry<BR>
===================<BR><BR>

This is the strangest one. Be warned, fellow roleplayers, the powergamers and anti-roleplay types will bandy this word around a lot when they interact with you, down purely to one of (or both of) two things - ignorance and arrogant intolerance.<BR><BR>

I have been called a hypocrit for roleplaying a number of times by the ignorant few. In every single case, it is by someone who barely knows me at all, nevermind the roleplay rules by which I play, simply becuase I refused to rez them for being evil or becuase I found fault with some aspect of their play (eg they are a ninja looter or some other anti-social practice). I know this would equally be levelled at any roleplayer who made any decision that this type of person did not like or agree with. It is, most assuredly, the cry of the fool.<BR><BR>

The word 'hypocrit' is a strange word. I see it banded about a lot by people who clearly do not know what it means, and it makes me laugh every time. Not everyone can be educated, I know, but certain words have specific meanings, and it never fails to make the speaker look a total fool when they attempt to insult someone and use an inappropriate word.<BR><BR>

Hypocrit means (simple way to say it): someone who says one thing and does the complete opposite or very close to it.<BR><BR>

For example, I would be a hypocrit if I sent Felishanna to hunt on the Plane of Tunare, or had her purposely kill elves or other 'good' creatures, or ninja looted a corpse (I despise people who do this and have said so many times). These are all things I have publically stated she will never do. She never has. She never will.<BR><BR>

By contrast, things that are stated and then carried out are not hypocritical, but deliberate and pre-planned. Examples of this are: refusing to ressurect evils, grouping with non-evils (even if they themselves have grouped with evils), or grouping with those who have hunted on the Plane of Tunare (unless I saw them do it, or they boasted to me in-character that they have). These things are sticking to my own rules, and so are fine by me. All any roleplayer need do is define their own rules and stick to them, and they have my utmost respect, regardless almost of what the rules are (assuming they are within the EverQuest EULA of course).<BR><BR>

The nastier of the powergamer non-roleplayer types are not interested in our roleplay rules. They are only interested in themselves or in self-defence of indefensible actions, and will attack anyone who crosses their path and criticises them as best they think they are able, and if you are a roleplayer, this is a favorite target. Personally, I do not worry about them, they can just find another cleric. <BR><BR>

Conclusion<BR>
========<BR><BR>

There are many ways to play EverQuest. I love the way I play it, though I know it is not for everyone. I wish more people did roleplay, and then I would not have to adapt my playstyle to allow for this so much, but it is a fact of Norrath that most people do not, and I accept that (with all the difficulties this brings for me).<BR><BR>

I know at least a few like and appreciate it. I hope I touch positively the gaming experiences of many more. As I have said elsewhere, if I can have fun and help some of those around me enjoy their fun a little more, I will be happy. The rest of the players, can, hopefully find their own fun in their own approaches to this wonderful game, and I will not bother them.</td></tr>
