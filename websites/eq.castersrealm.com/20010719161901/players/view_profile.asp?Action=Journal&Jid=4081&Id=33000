  <tr><td class='db'> </td></tr>
  <tr><td class='db'><p>  In my 39th season, I anticipated learning more about how to transform my life
energy into mana.  Upon purchasing my new spells from spell vendors, I learned that 
none of them had ever heard of the appropriate spell scroll.  This greatly puzzled me, 
so I went to a number of libraries I knew of in order to find out where this scroll could
be obtained.  I found out that the appropriate scroll either was lost or didn't exist.  I
overheard a powerful shaman once in a tavern boasting that he had actually found the
scroll and scribed the spell, and instead of arguing, I carefully took notes on his
adventure. </p>

<p>It turns out that the vendor who sells alchemist supplies in Firiona Vie, when queried, will
give one a list of four items that must be returned to her in order for her to produce
from them the appropriate scroll.  I found out that obtaining this items was no small
feat for a 39th season shaman.  Indeed, many 50th level shamans never obtain
the scroll.  Showing my typical temerity, I refused to believe that the items could not immediately
be secured by a shaman of my growing abilities.  I was to find out how wrong I was.</p>

<p>The first item need turned out to be the easiest to find.  I simply had to run out 
to a certain island in the Timorous Deep, and pick it up.  There I found a bag of crushed
diamonds just laying on the shore of an ice bound island.  From my notes, I learned that
the same crushed diamonds could be procured in a more difficult manner, but I was perfectly
satisfied to pick them up from the ground. </p>

<p> The second item I learned were some bones that were carried by a skeleton warlord
in Karnor's Castle.  I entered this castle for the first time in my 40th season, and quickly
found it to be exceedingly dangerous.  However, I hailed a group of embattled companions
just outside the moat of the castle and asked them if they had seen the skeleton warlord
that I sought.  They replied that if they saw the beast they would tell me.  I carefully paced 
outside the castle, and too my surprise, they pulled a skeleton warlord from the castle's
interior and overpowered it.  I was able to obtain the bones, and left immediately.</p>

<p> The next item I pursued was a strange ochre clay carried by an army behemoth in
the City of Mist.  The only way one can survive at my age in that cursed city is to group
with others fighting there and hope you are not overcome.  I fought along side others for
many days without seeing the clay.  Fortunately, during this time I was able to collect some 
materials I needed for the quest to obtain the spear of fate I have written about elsewhere
in this journal.  Finally, as I sat in a group talking to a small but sturdy gnomish warrior
in between battles, he mentioned that he had picked up the needed clay during one
of his prevous visits to the city.  He generously gave the clay to me.  All I needed was 
powder from a froglok yun shaman, and I could obtain the lost scroll.</p>

<p>  It was early in my 42nd season that I journeyed deep into the dangerous jungles of
Traknon's Teeth, the name given to the mountains of the region around the ruins of Sebilis.
Traknon, it seems, is a particularly dangerous dragon who is rumored to live somewhere in
the region.  I thought that this froglok yun shaman would be easily overcome.  I had fought
a variety of froglok shamans named tal, vin, and soforth, and had always found that I
could overcome them without the aid of others.  I came to the walls of the ruined city of
Sebilis, dodging trakanasaurs, sabertooths, and all manner of dangerous beasts.  After resting
at the gate, I began to search in the immediate surroundings of the gate and a ruined 
aqueduct.  After calling out to travelers I knew were in the region on their way to the fabled
city of Old Sebils, one shouted back that they had seen a yun shaman in a small valley to the west
of the city gate.  Shortly after entering this valley I spotted a yun shaman hopping rapidly across
my path.  I chased it until it was near the walls of the city, then proceeded to engage it.  To
my surprise, it was much more accomplished in the shamanic arts than any other such
froglok I had seen, with perhaps the exception of an urd shaman, and I found that I could
not overpower it.  I gated back to my bind point in an underground cave just outside 
Traknon's Teeth just before I was overpowered.  I revised my strategy, and returned to
the Sebilis gate area.  This time, I called up a vigilant spirit to assist me, and made
ready with an array of my best spells.  Again I found the yun shaman, and to my dismay he
defeated me by the narrowest of margins.  After regaining my things, I went after him
again using the same strategy.  This time, however, the battle was joined by a wandering
undead iksar, and I wisely gated back to my bind point.  Again I returned, summoned my spirit,
and sought the yun shaman.  Again I engaged him, and nearly had him overpowered when
I ran out of mana.  Not having enough mana to gate, but still having an active poison spell on
him, I began to retreat, when to my dismay I stumbled across a froglok shin knight who
joined the battle.  The two of them defeated me before I could run away, and again I had
to return the the place of battle to collect the things I was forced to leave in defeat.

<p>By this time, I had lost considerable experience that had been dearly won, so I sat at
the gate of Sebilis and petitioned a passing cleric to restore with his holy powers some of
the experience I had lost in my previous two defeats.  He consented to do this, and offered
to help me with the yun shaman.  As night fell, it began to rain, and we again pursued 
the yun shaman in the small valley outside Sebilis.  The cleric was much more experienced
than I, being in his 57th season, and I was sure we would easily defeat the froglok.  Since
he was waiting for some companions, we made no formal agreement to group.  Together
we located the shaman and attacked it, but made the mistake of doing so in the middle
of the jungle, rather than by the gate to the city.  We nearly had the shaman defeated when
suddenly, out of no where, we were attacked on all sides by at least three more frogloks.
The yun shaman died, but I could not loot his corpse since we had not formed a group.
I quickly was defeated at the hands of the other frogloks, and all the cleric could do
was watch.  He again restored some of my experience, and this time we made a formal
agreement to group so that we could share the spoils of victory.   He went out to find another
yun shaman while I rested by the gate.  Now in my limited experience, clerics are the
least equipped to go out and hunt for enemies and bring them to the rest of the group,
and the yun shaman was able to seriously injure him before he brought it back to the gate.
I attacked with all I had left, being plainly exhausted and nearly out of mana.  It was a 
close fight, but thank the Tribunal, the yun shaman reluctantly died.  I was able to
take the powder from the shaman's corpse, finally.</p>

<p>  So after several long seasons, I was able to turn in the items to the alchemy vendor,
 and she happily
produce the scroll for me.  Upon obtaining the scroll, I was awarded a sufficient amount
of experience that I actually entered my 42nd season as a shaman.  In retrospect, I
find it rather curious that a spell able to be scribed by a 39th level shaman, in reality 
took much more effort to obtain than its relatively modest level suggested.</p></td></tr>
