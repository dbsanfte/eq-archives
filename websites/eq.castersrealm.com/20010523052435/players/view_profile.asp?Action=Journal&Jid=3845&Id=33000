  <tr><td class='db'><p>I write these words in the hope that someone might find them of some use in 
their journeys through Norrath. </b> 

<p>In my wanderings in different forms across the various known realms of the 
mysterious land of Norrath I settled on the form of a barbarian shaman because
it seemed to resonate with some deep seated feelings I can't explain.  Not knowing
much of the way of the shaman I thought only of outward fighting abilities and keen
intellect in forming my abilities, sadly neglecting to add much to my deeper ability 
to show wisdom in all I engaged in.  This set my subsequent course to a path less
traveled by others of my class.  While showing a propensity to learn quickly and fight
ferociously, I have had to be very consciencious in developing my abilities in shamanic
magic. </p> 

<p>Most of my first 30 seasons were spent learning about how to fight by myself, but
being ready to contribute to a group of adventurers when the opportunity presented
itself.  I spent many long hours fighting gnolls in the depths of Blackburrow, dying many
times for the hard earned experience there.  In my 9th season I learned how to cast
a spell that made myself and others run faster than the monsters we fought.  This
reduced the number of deaths I suffered at the hands of my enemies considerably.
In my 14th season, I learned another powerful spell that allowed me to bind myself to
any place that I visited.  I knew at that point it was time for me to leave Everfrost and its
environs and seek greater adventure.  I wandered widely across Antonica and Faydwer
seeking experience and finding out more of what my role in Norrath would be.  In my 
25th season I learned of a special type of armor that only shamans could wear, and I
became consumed with traveling across all of Norrath in search of items that I might
use to petition certain wise shamans that lived on the shores of Lake Rathetear to 
fashion various pieces of this armor for me.  Two pieces of that armor eluded me, and as
I approached my 30 season, I despaired that I would ever obtain them.</p>

<p>  While hunting for a particular type of scale that fell from a rare kind of drake that
lived in the Mountains of Rathe, I chanced upon a young paladin the same age as I.  We 
quickly became friends, and she told me of a group of adventurers of roughly her same
age that had banded together to form a guild.  They called themselves Aurora Infinitum
to celebrate what they felt was their eternal friendship to one another.  My new friend
Taylorianne said that in being the same age as each other, they could assist one another
in their various quests for experience, knowledge, and power.  I was impressed by the
comradarie of these people, so chose to ally myself with them. </p>

<p>  As my 30th season approached, I heard rumors of a strange new land that many in
Norrath had begun to explore.  I ventured across a small channel to a strange island off
the coast of the Oasis of Marr that was inhabited by ogres and a strange form of bird like 
creature somewhat like the aviaks I had encountered in South Karana and Lake Rathetear.
These creatures left me alone, but I found myself continually getting into fights with the
ogre shamans that inhabited the island.  I found that they objected to my interpretation of
shamanic magic, and inevitably our debates turned violent.  I admit that although I might 
not have been blameless, at first I wasn't the one who was apt to throw the first punch.  I spent 
several seasons fighting with these misguided shamans, and though I often prevailed, they
never seemed to let go of their ferocious objections to my presence.  Finally, I found that
it was useless to continue fighting with them, so I fled to the Butcher Block mountains, greatly
discouraged by my failure to convert them to an enlightened view of shamanic magic. </p>

<p>  While sitting on the dock in Butcher Block, I noticed strange barges that regularly floated
out to sea, only to return a few minutes later.  A number of people were on these barges,
both coming and going, and I wondered if they were going to the land of Kunark, of which I
had heard so much.  I boarded one of these barges, and found that they were transporting
travelers to what appeared to be a relatively small boat of elven workmanship.  To my surprise,
as the barges neared the vessel, it kept getting larger and larger.  By the time I actually
boarded the vessel it was spectacularly large.  It was equipped with a kind of magical sail
that I had never seen before.  It took quite a bit of time for the craft to get going, but once
in motion, the vessel seemed to travel at a speed I thought was not possible.  Finally, the
boat docked at a large elven town dominated by a huge statue of some elven god.  Not
being particularly religious, I paid little attention to it.  The folks that lived in the town called
it Firiona Vie and to my delight I found barbarians living there.  They sold strange new spells, but
only one of them was one I could use at my young age. </p>

<p>  It has been over 15 seasons of my progression as a shaman since I first came to 
Firiona Vie, and since that time I have learned much.  I discovered several new weapons, and
in particular, found that I had an ability to use spears that I had not suspected I had.  A number
of wonderful spears are found across Norrath that are designed specifically to suit the abilities
of a shaman.  I have heard of at least seven such spears.  I have owned 3 of them, and seen two
others with my own eyes.  There are two, however, that I have never seen.  I tried hunting for
them but have never been successful.  One is rumored to be found on an injured polar bear that
lurks somewhere in Permafrost, although I have never seen any bears there.  The other is
apparently carried by a kind of viscious fish that lives in the underwater abyss of Kedge Keep.
The fish that we hunted there, though, carried no such spear. </p>
