<tr> 
<td width='80%'><P>This story starts shortly after acquiring Ghoulbane.</P>
<P>t'was dawn when I awoke, I put on my armor rythmically as I 
had become accustomed to from the teachings of my elders. Looking out the window 
the sun was just starting to rise and the ocean lapped its waves on the eastern 
shore of Freeport. Getting my gear together I left the inn and headed for the 
docks. Last night during my visit to the tavern I'd heard rumours of a vile 
place on the continent of Faydwer containing undead minions. In the past I'd 
fought hard to win my most prized posession, my only sword that I would die for, 
Ghoulbane. From myth and legend I had read the sword was supposed to have powers 
that would only work on the exhumed and undead evil that scoured the land. My 
duty as a knight had truly become clear when I acquired this sword, and I knew 
that I must investigate this place of evil. Getting on the daily transport ship 
to Faydwer I pondered what the battle ahead would have in store for me. After 
nearly a days trip spent we had arrived at Faydwer. The scene that I entered was 
completely foreign to me. This was the first time I had ever seen dwarves in 
such masses. Shopkeepers lined the walls of the docks peddling their wares and 
swindling their prospect customers. I knew this would be an interesting 
experience.</P>
<P>Asking directions for the closest city was not easy, every 
shopkeeper treated me as if I were a wet sewer rat begging for food. Some 
growled duiously while others seemed indifferent to my presence. I wandered 
around looking for a familiar face, at least a human that spoke common. Finally 
I found an adventurer that was willing to help me and show me the way to the 
city. He said it was famed for the statue that was in Kaladim's image that 
towered over the city entrance.</P>
<P>After a short run we arrived and I was indeed was awed by 
the sheer hugeness of this statue. It was bigger than anything I had ever seen, 
even the Clocktower in Qeynos was no match for this statue. After marvelling at 
the statue, I walked into the city and stocked up on the supplies I would 
need.</P>
<P>Leaving the city behind me, I journeyed through the valleys 
between the Butcherblock mountains and following the paths that were well 
trodden, I found a huge canyon where the path ended. A sign informed me that 
this was the entrance to Dagnor's Cauldron. I pondered to myself what the 
significance of the name had to do with the place, and who this Dagnor fellow 
might be. Probably just another dwarf.</P>
<P>I ran in gettting impatient with my lack of progress at 
finding the place I had come to seek. Travelling along the shorline of rock and 
hugging the cliffs for safety, I saw a camp ahead. Walking to the camp I was 
greeted kindly by a group of guards at the camp and was told to beware the road 
ahead. They had seen a group of goblins setting up camp and had encountered a 
number of them. They informed me if I got into any trouble I couldn't handle 
alone to run back their way for reinforcements. I asked them of the place called 
the Estate of Unrest, they told me the entrance could be found carved into the 
side of a cliff and bid me farewell.</P>
<P>I passed the goblin camp stealthily, so I thought. Ahead of 
me was a sneering Aqua Goblin Bosun. I'd never seen a goblin and did not know 
what it was capable of doing. I brandished my sword and let out a battle cry, 
"In the name of Karana, leave me be or meet your maker!" The goblin heeded no 
warning and ran at me with teeth bared and claws ready to draw blood. Prepared 
for the rush I met him with a bash of my shield to disorient him and laid into 
him with my sword, cutting him fiercely across the midsection, fearing he might 
run away and call for help from his camp, I used the powers given to me by 
Karana to root the foe. He could not move but put up a tremendous fight as he 
took his last breath. I brought my sword down across his neck and brought him 
down bleeding and broken. Searching his corpse I found nothing of interest, a 
few coins, a hunters bow, and 4 arrows. I put the items in my backpack and kept 
upon the path given me.</P>
<P>Entering the side of the cliff I brandished Ghoulbane and 
watched as it glowed in my hand. It seemed the sword was preparing itself for 
the battle that lie shortly ahead. Using it's light I navigated the corridor and 
into the opening of the placed called Unrest. Walking into the courtyard I saw 
tormented dead and greater skeletons. Neither looked like much to contend with. 
Walking between the two hedge mazes and to the front door of the Mansion, I 
opened the door and peered in. All was clear, too quiet with the exceptions of 
the creaking of the boards upstairs. Knowing there was unknown foes in the 
house, I cast invisibility to Undead on myself. When the tingling sensation went 
away I knew I was protected.</P>
<P>I tread lightly through the house making as little noise as 
possible, everything was clear that I could see. I encountered a stairwell and 
began to walk up it when I heard a loud grainy sound. It resembled laughter, or 
rather a cackling. Reaching the top step I felt intense heat, singeing my hair 
and burning my skin. Before I knew it I had a Dry bones skeleton on me with all 
of its force. Running back the way I had come, I flew through the doors as fast 
as I could and jumped in the fountain to put out the fire that had started on my 
clothing due to the second burst of flame that hit me as I ran. Turning around 
just in time to see the creature swinging his sword at me, I parried and lashed 
out with my sword. Nothing happened, a few chips flew from the ribcage but no 
obvious damage was done to the skeletal vermin. Again I lashed out with my 
sword, this time shouting a chant I had been taught in my upbringing to ward 
away evil. I felt a divine sensation course through me, up my legs, to my torso, 
to the arm that was wielding Ghoulbane. In disbelief I watched as the sword 
starting glowing white hot, and I brought the weapon down upon the skeleton. At 
contact a huge white explosion went off, sending shards and splinters of bone 
everywhere. I wielded the sword again with the same sensation coursing through 
me, electrifying me, strengthening me and again I brought it down, this time to 
the spine of the beast as it was running with fear, again an explosion! This 
time the beast splintered, broke, shattered and flew into pieces and landed in a 
pile on the ground before me. I was in shock, I'd never witnessed such power 
before. I quickly regained my composure and searched the bones left behind. To 
my suprise there was a platinum piece and a piece of small bronze armor. I knew 
this trip would fare well and that I would gain much experience in my fighting 
tactics and strategies here. With that battle behind me, and knowing what lies 
ahead I knew I needed rest. A day of travel and the battle had completely 
exhausted me. I felt drained and needed sleep badly. I walked back out of the 
estate and set up camp in the corridor outside. Dreaming about battles to be 
won, money gained and glory for my god Karana.</P>
