<p>-----</p>
<p>The figure sat in a black marble room. Except for the sound of its rasping breath, it could have been dead. It was draped in the blackest of black cloaks, which would have covered it from head to toe if it had been standing. The figure's clothes were a dark crimson, and seemed to be made from silk. Closer inspection would reveal it to be dyed adamantium, woven so finely and enchanted so much that it managed to flow like silk would. The figure held a glass filled with red wine, but never took a sip. Finally, N'Vitar entered the room, and the wine was set down.</p>
<p>Even N'Vitar was a little uneasy around the figure, and he regretted that he needed to deal with him at all. "Praleth, sorry to have kept you waiting."</p>
<p>Praleth stood as N'Vitar sat down. "Don't keep me longer still with your foolish sentiment. Who am I after?"</p>
<p>N'Vitar motioned for the figure to sit, but it declined it. Frowning slightly, N'Vitar explained, " Ravell. A renegade..."</p>
<p>Praleth interrupted. "I don't care about his history, or what he is to you. How much?"</p>
<p>"Five-hundred." N'Vitar's hawklike eyes watched the figure as if he expected it to reach out and take his life at any second.</p>
<p>"Five-hundred? Surely you could have hired any fool for that price. No, if I am to do this there will be no discount. Five thousand." Praleth's voice grated uncomfortably.</p>
<p>N'Vitar nodded, expecting this. "Ravell is but a thorn in my side, but I need him alive. He is inexperienced, and should be easy for you. One-thousand is more than worth it."</p>
<p>Praleth sighed irritably. "I decide what is worth it. If he is so simple a foe, then what am I doing here? You know better than to bother me with trivial assignments."</p>
<p>"Well, he is lucky. He defeated the twins..." N'Vitar confessed</p>
<p>"I see..." Praleth paced. "What of the twins then?"</p>
<p>N'Vitar looked amused. "You care?"</p>
<p>Praleth stopped pacing, which somehow managed to make N'Vitar even more uneasy. "I am...interested in those two. I <i>was</i> interested, rather."</p>
<p>"Interested? Very well, I have a new proposition. Deliver Ravell to me, alive, and I'll deliver the twins to you...more or less alive."N'Vitar stood to face Praleth.</p>
<p>Praleth chuckled, a horrible sound. "More or less...very well, you have a deal."</p>
<p>As Praleth moved to leave, N'Vitar stopped him. "Don't you want to know where to find him?"</p>
<p>Praleth chuckled again, making N'Vitar sorry he had asked. "I have my own means." Without another word he strode out of the room. N'Vitar exhaled, glad to be done with that experience.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>"So, what of this invasion?" Kazinn wiped a little dust from his robes.</p>
<p>Ravell shrugged. "I don't really know much. There are drow here, and they plan to take over the elven cities sometime."</p>
<p>"Here...where here?" Seeing Ravell shrug again, Kazinn decided on another question. "Sometime? Sometime soon?" Ravell shrugged again, unknowingly. "Well, you seem to have come well prepared. Drow are <i>somewhere</i> on the continent, and will attack <i>sometime</i>. Do you at least know how many there are?"</p>
<p>Ravell shrugged again. Kazinn sighed loudly, then did it again to make his point.</p>
<p>"We don't know what to do. It seems hopeless, but there has to be something..." Lenia remarked.</p>
<p>Kazinn turned and nearly fell to his face tripping over his robes. "Yes well, I know of <i>something</i> we can do, but I don't like it at all. Then again I don't much like the idea of traipsing around without so much as a clue as to when this 'invasion' is going to happen either."</p>
<p>Ravell looked Kazinn in the eyes. "What can we do?"</p>
<p>Kazinn inspected Ravell a moment as a person might inspect a bug crawling on his or her sleeve. "We go to Crushbone, lair of the orcs. There's a drow there by the name of D'Vinn, right nasty fellow. Never met him personally but I've seen his dirty work in the form of countless young elf corpses. He'd likely know where the drow are hiding.  Of course, to get to him we have to fight hordes of orcs, invade a friggin' castle, and say hello to King Crush himself. Not too pleasant an undertaking."</p>
<p>"Then we go." Ravell's urgency was apparent through his voice. "Where's Crushbone?"</p>
<p>Kazinn looked at Ravell incredulously before turning to Lenia. "Your friend over here's been hit in the head too many times, he wants to go storm the castle right now! We'll need more than just ourselves and it would be helpful if we rested a bit as well, drow."</p>
<p>Ravell shrugged again. "I'll go then, just show me the way."</p>
<p>"Seems your warrior friend is confusing suicide with bravery. Listen carefully, warrior, there are literally dozens of orcs in this place, not to mention that you want to dance with the top, most heavily trained orc of all, and even if you lived through all of that there's still the matter of the dagger wielding D'Vinn himself." Kazinn started speaking to Lenia but by the end had turned to face Ravell and stare him in the face to drive his point home.</p>
<p>Ravell still looked unconvinced, so Lenia tried to reason with him. "Ravell, you aren't going to get anywhere rushing headlong into this like a fool. Some very experienced elven warriors have walked into Crushbone and ended up dead or worse. You don't stand a chance alone. You aren't going to be able to do much to save Faydwer if you're dead now, are you?"</p>
<p>"Alright, Lenia...I suppose you have a point. I just don't want to waste any time." Ravell sighed and relaxed a little.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Lilith was, for once, not in her heavy black armor. She stood across a table in a pitch black room across from an old drow man with a shock of black hair running along with the rest of his white. Lilith was dressed in fine black clothes laced with red.  The old man didn't seem to notice her.  His expression was casual, which was neither surprising nor unusual. Lilith had never seen him look interested or concerned about anything. His eyes were hooded, and an inexperienced person might think him lazy. But beneath his seemingly unaware looks was a mind always alert, always ready, and always thinking. A sphere hovered over the table, and the only thing that kept it from being completely black was a swirling purple mist inside.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I haven't visited more, Trelass, I've been busy at the academy." Lilith made a slight bow and then sat in a chair opposite the old drow.</p>
<p>"No matter...time is different for those of us with great age and greater minds. A day for you is a minute for me. I keep myself busy, you see..." Trelass was cut off by Lilith.</p>
<p>"Sir, I hate to rush you but I cannot stay for long." Lilith tried to keep the venom from her voice. She hated dealing with this long-winded fool. He would lecture her on the most inane things, then forget what he was saying mid-speech.</p>
<p>The old man's face hadn't moved, and his voice barely changed tones at all. "Very well, right to business. You want to know about this renegade...don't affirm it I already know. There's a bit of hubbub about him, and there's little I don't....what was I saying? Oh yes, the rebel.  Let's see what we can learn about him, then. Hrmm...he has two allies traveling with him, and he is on Faydwer...about to head for Crushbone, or perhaps near it."</p>
<p>Lilith tried to see into the swirling mists that the old drow was looking at, but saw nothing. "He is with the paladin and...that wench, isn't he?!"</p>
<p>Trelass' eyebrow moved very slightly, then returned to its usual place quickly. "Not a paladin, but he is with a female...the other is a magician, a novice. The female...she is blurred. I cannot get a clear reading on her. Perhaps she has some sort of blocking device..."</p>
<p>"I don't care." Lilith let her tongue slip, then looked to see if Trelass had noticed. He didn't seem to have, so she went on. "N'Vitar told me he had dispatched some of his men to capture Ravell. What of them?"</p>
<p>Trelass slouched a little in his seat, looking at the ball casually. "He sent the twins, Rockel and Reckel. Both are dead." Lilith was about to say something when he interjected. "But, there is a new assailant now. He is blurry...give me a moment."</p>
<p>"I bet it's Halamke, she's a very good hunter." Lilith guessed, a tinge of envy in her voice.</p>
<p>"No...this one is...darker. I think I can get his name, but no more." Trelass for once concentrated on the orb in front of him, leaning forward. "Yes. His name is Praleth."</p>
<p>"Praleth?!" Lilith stood up quickly. "N'Vitar sent Praleth after them?! But...he'd just as soon kill Ravell as bring him in alive!"</p>
<p>The old man made a slight movement that could have been a shrug. "I do not know of this name, but he is too dark to read. Is there anything else?"</p>
<p>Lilith turned to leave, hesitated, then faced Trelass again. "Nothing else. Here." She tossed a few platinum coins onto the table, which Trelass made a minimal effort to catch then gave up and sat back again.</p>
<p>"That girl is heading for trouble...good. I never cared for her attitude anyway." Trelass remarked to himself aloud before sitting back and looking at the ball again.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>"No, you two go ahead. I'll be fine out here. My eyes are good, I'll be able to see anything in the night as clearly as if it were day." Ravell made shooing motions to Lenia and Kazinn.</p>
<p>"You're sure you'll be fine? I could stay out here and keep watch, it'd be no trouble." Lenia asked.</p>
<p>Ravell smiled again, glad that she cared. "No, no. I'm a big boy, I'm able to take care of myself. If you want to help, you can get me some food and maybe a couple drinks from Kelethin while you're there."</p>
<p>"Alright, we'll be back before you know it."Lenia waved before turning and walking hesitantly away.</p>
<p>Ravell grinned mischieviously and whispered under his breath, "Besides...I want to go scout around a bit outside Crushbone."</p>
