  <tr><td class='db'> </td></tr>
  <tr><td class='db'>From early childhood, Thalestris knew she was different from her family, different from her playmates.  Rather than blindly accepting her surroundings as it seemed most of her clan did, she constantly asked questions.  "Why does it snow all the time?  Why do wolves have fur but we don't?  Where does the sun go at night?"  Her mother, a strong and brave but dull-witted warrior, despaired of answering her questions. It was difficult for her to understand the girl, difficult to raise such a child alone.  Finally, she took little Thale to Margyn McCann, the leader of the shaman guild.  Margyn quickly recognized the child's unusual intelligence and potential, and immediately began a course of instruction to nurture her native curiosity.  Thale thrived, finally having her questions answered, her thirst for knowledge satisfied, and was initiated into the ranks of shaman at the tender age  of 17. 

 She had learned her lessons well- the arts of healing, of using the energy from the spirits of  animals to subtly enhance one's natural gifts, and the related arts of turning an enemy's health awry, siphoning his energy and strengths, and utilizing the venomous spirits of snakes to poison him unto death.  She learned as well to defend herself and others, as the Tribunal expects their children to be active and not passive worshippers in the pursuit of justice.  Thalestris studied and practiced, yet yearned to test her prowess outside the sheltered halls of Halas- to see new lands and peoples she only knew of from the songs of traveling bards.  She ventured farther and farther from the shaman guild, and finally, one day, swam across the lake into Everfrost.

She wandered through the cave, peering at the wares of merchants, listening to the animated chatter of others, when her attention was distracted by a colorfully dressed human male, leaning on his staff and staring at her intently.  Thale was overwhelmed with excitement and curiosity - she had seen humans before, but only merchants and bards.  This was a spellcaster, surely, with that beautiful robe and staff, a real magi!!  She had so many questions to ask such a wise and travelled personage.  His name was Wizzenfeld, he told her, kissing her strong, rough hand as though it were the milky hand of an elven princess.  They conversed until moonrise, the mage telling  tales of other lands, of battles won and lost, and of the evil and injustice that required all those of good heart to oppose and vanquish.  Thalestris' head was spinning with this elegant and brilliant man, and she went to her furs that night dreaming of his stories.  After her lessons, she rushed back to the cave, holding her breath lest her new found friend have moved on.  He was there, and took her through the tundra, encouraging her to test her lessons on the evil gnolls and goblins, the rampaging bear cubs and skeletons.  Wizzenfeld showed her his magic, summoning a pet from the ether, and made armor for her from the pelts of the animals she killed.  Finally, he told her that he must be on his way with the next sunrise.  

Thalestris was in an agony of indecision.  To go with the mage, to stay with her people.  She went to her guild, and was given the blessing of Margyn to leave the clan and explore the world, but warned that she must return for periodic bouts of training and to purchase new spells as she earned the power to use them.  Thale's mother was saddened by her decision, but had given over her child's welfare to the shaman, and could not oppose where they had allowed.  She told Thalestris to be careful, and keep her weapon bright and ready to her hand.  She hesitated, and then pulled a dusty box from under her armor trunk, and extracted a small blue-bound book.  "Your father left this behind, Thale.  I should have told you long ago, but he was not one of us.  I couldn't understand much of it, but perhaps you can read it and discover more about yourself through him."  It was a diary.  The journal of a travelling enchanter, who had taken on the form of a barbarian man to woo her mother.  As Thalestris pored over the crumbling pages, she read of other women, other races, other daughters.  She vowed to discover all of her half-siblings, to befriend and care for them, and to wreck her vengence on this uncaring man who had loved and left, with never a thought for the families he had created.  She swore to never fear or hate a member of another race ( though her clan considered all outsiders dubiously), for any one could be her sister.  She would ignore outward differences, she decided, and judge each person by their heart alone.  

And so, Thalestris travelled with Wizzenfeld, learning from him and fighting by his side.  He created a guild of his own, for people of all races and classes to come together to fight, feast and drink in peace.  Thale grew in power and knowledge, making friends with people of all the races and classes she had dreamed of in her childhood.  She has found one half-sister, an Erudite fledgling wizard named Alif, befriending her and bringing her into the larger family of the guild, but has never stopped her search for her other lost sisters.  Interpreting the diary further, she next intends to search the swamps of Innothule for a troll maiden raised by a mother alone.  Above all else, Thalestris seeks to fulfill her holy vows to the Tribunal, opposing injustice wherever she finds it, healing the sick and injured, always seeking to learn from everyone she meets, and to grow in her powers so that she may be a worthy child of the Tribunal.

Thale's heart, while warmed by the love and support of her guildmates, has lately been filling with a different love.  A member of her guild has taken her attention, and won her admiration with his bravery, strength and determination.  Soon, she hopes to speak with him alone, to tell him of her feelings and to pray to the Tribunal that he can return them and come to love her as she loves him.
