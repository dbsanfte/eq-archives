  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p>Well it seems there are no strategies for the 50+ pally, so I
thought I would add what I've gathered over the years. <br>
<br>
Our first and best role is and always will be damage-absorbing
tank. AC, hp and a good shield are usually our highest
priorities. Our offense caps lower than warriors, monks, rogues,
and rangers, and as such we miss a lot. There are times when it's
worth it to swap in a good 2hs to put out a little more damage,
but there are lots of half-tanks out there who's job is to put
the beating out. Normally only a warrior will have more hp than
you, with sk's being on par with us. A cleric who is CH'ing
(complete heal) the primary tank is the most efficient way to go
in most situations, since even with a ton of ac you'll still be
getting hit for over 100, and up to 150 by regular mobs. Our
taunt caps are horribly low, so we must use other tricks to keep
mobs on us. Only when there is a warrior or possibly sk should we
ever give up the main tank role. <br>
<br>
1. How to tuant with more than just a button. <br>
a. root. mobs can take a while to die in tank-heavy groups, so
root in the beginning. It will help you get hated more, and if
someone is snaring they won't need to cast it for some time
anyways. When a mob is rooted, he who is closest has the best
chance of getting hit. Get right in their ugly mugs :D <br>
b. stun. Mobs hate this. even the non-casters will start hitting
you for casting this mana-cheap spell. <br>
c. DD. One of my favorite hangouts is Karnors Castle, where there
is plenty of undead. keep dismiss or expel memmed, dropping
160-200dd on them will really help you taunt. <br>
d. pacify/soothe. This has a long cast and is quite often
resisted. I don't keep it memmed usually, but when it sticks will
wipe the hate list of the target. try it out for yourself. <br>
<br>
So, in groups where you have a real healer, you make a great
tank. Your next role is puller. Yes, monks make the best pullers
usually, and I will usually defer to one. When one is not around,
use the tools you have. you can try your luck with pacify, when
it sticks you can walk right by a kos mob, allowing you to split
a spawn. You can often root one and it will send its buddy
running after you, but you have to be careful that no others will
walk by the rooted one, as he will yell for help and add you to
the other's hate list. this can cause massive trains o' death.
The primary reason i like pulling over a warrior or other tank
type, is simply that pallies are tough to kill. we can root, we
can stun, we can heal, and of course LOH. In high level dungeons
trains will happen while you're pulling, and often pallies are
the only ones who can survive (excepting those who succeed at
fd).<br>
<br>
3. Cleric. I promise there will be days you will be the healer of
your group. Sadly there are just not enough clerics to go around.
Obviously the best thing you can do is get to 57 and superior
healing, but you can still be a passable cleric in a smart group.
Always carry around some good wisdom gear. I have with me:<br>
molten cloak<br>
jarsath legs<br>
jarsath bracer<br>
bloodstone eyepatch<br>
<br>
in addition to all my normal tanking gear, that i try to get with
some wisdom anyway. forest loop, etc. My tanking gear gives me
140 wisdom, with the above i can boost it even more. Playing
cleric is never fun for a tank, and deciding when to med and when
to swing is an art. Hopefully you will be able to find a real
healer for your group without too much of this cleric stuff. <br>
<br>
I have noticed that many high level clerics will only buff the
group with reso/hero, as the other buffs are mana expensive. Take
the time to buff the rest of the tanks with guard/aof when you
can, and always keep a symbol on yourself and/or the main tank.
Jaspers are cheap, and I aways keep bards and chanters symbol'd
as well, as I've found once the crowd control dies, things go
from bad to train. <br>
<br>
3. Chain-stunner. <br>
At 52 you get your 3rd stun, force. with a shield equipped,
caster mobs will be hard pressed to get a spell off. I always
keep stun, my fastest casting stun, hotkeyed. You will have time
to cast it and throw in a bash if it gets resisted. Many mobs
gate that are 50+, and besides robbing your group of xp and loot,
can bring massive trains of death when you go looking for it.
Count on no one else to interrupt the casters. No warrior will be
using a shield, and clerics/chanters and other classes who can
stun are often occupied. Always save mana for stuns, and ask the
puller to hold on if you're oom. <br>
<br>
4. Crowd control. <br>
at 54 we get enstill, a version of root that actually works. Our
level 20 version is not completely useless though, and when there
is no chanter or bard around, it is often best for us to root
park stuff. If you can, when you see your puller coming back with
more than one, stun one 20 feet away from your group and root it.
Either ask a caster in your group to keep it rooted or turn and
root it every 30 seconds or so. The good news is when root
breaks, he will come for you, so you can run away from the group
and park him again. Pallies do the least melee damage, so your
rounds will be missed least. The tough part is when you can't
stun them before they get to you, and have to manage to taunt
them away. As long as you're not assisting the main assist (this
is the only time I would approve) you will eventually get the mob
to turn to you and you can back him away and park him. It is much
more important to have one mob hitting your group at a time than
to get a few extra rounds in. Most mobs you're fighting have a
ton of hp and can outdamage any 2 tanks, so it's not worth the
trade off to have you hitting one instead of parking. <br>
<br>
Paladins can be one of the best role-played classes in the game,
and our abilities suit us well. Use your mana for downtime heals,
buff everyone when appropriate, and keep everyone alive. <br>
<br>
Hopefully I'll be 60 in a few months, and I'll tell you what it's
like to be as good as a lvl 50 cleric. <br>
Till then, peace holy warriors. </p>
