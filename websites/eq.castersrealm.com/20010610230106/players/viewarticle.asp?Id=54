	<p>The ranger looked back, then forth, then was violently ill over the side of the ship. Yakov Shadeleaf hated the ocean with a passion. “#@#! it all! Damn ravening beasts!”</p>

	<p>“Cheer up, Yak.” Dirk, newly reinstated as a knight, hefted the mug he carried. ”Want a drink?”</p>

	<p>“That might help. I hate that emptiness.”</p>

	<p>“Come down to the tavern. We can tell the others about what’s going on in a little.”</p>

	<p>The two old friends departed.</p>


	<p>Jesica Shadeleaf stood at the rail of the Sirensbane. Her head hurt from thinking too much about this. She did not understand what was going on at all. Her wounding, the attack on Kelethin, and her rescue of Dirk had stressed the young woman out to the point of mental exhaustion. She gripped the cup of elven wine she carried around with a white-knuckled grip, and took a sip. She wondered again why her cousin hated elven wine, preferring mild alcohol and water. But there was a lot wrong with Yakov, another flaw wouldn’t make much of an impact.</p>

	<p>A cold wind blew on the deck of the Sirensbane.</p>

	<p>“God, can’t my Lord Karana give me a rest?” the young rogue muttered. “First he stays still, then he blows hard, then....” Her speech degenerated into grumbles. She thought and tried to sort out her feelings about her older friend, the Black Elf. She liked him very much, but-</p>

	<p>Almost invisible in the darkness, a shape dropped from the mast of the suddenly silent ship.</p>
	
	<p>The rogue froze. Her hands very, very slowly descended into her boots and withdrew her daggers. Her hearing picked up the unmistakable sounds of daggers leaving their sheaths, and a soft breathing.
“Who are you?”</p>

	<p>“The one who kills you.”</p>

	<p>She saw the shape emerge into the light. It wasn’t a dark elf, nor an elf at all. It was a human male, clad in black leathers that wrapped his shape around like a piece of living shadow. He also carried twin daggers. He leered at her. “Nice body, girl. You could make money an entirely different way.”</p>

	<p>“Not my style. I’m afraid I don’t know your name....” Jesica said in a pleasant, businesslike tone.</p>

	“Well, does it matter? The simple situation is this. I’m here to kill you and your friends. You don’t want to die. So, we fight, no?” The human looked questioningly at her.</p>

	<p>“You do know that if you kill me, you’ll be incapable of getting out of here. I can make your problems go away....” She also gave him a questioning look. </p>

	<p>“Don’t presume to know my methods.” the scoundrel said, and he placed his daggers into a guard position. Jesica frowned. This was no inexperienced soldier or common thug. This man was a pro killer. He undoubtedly knew how it was done. He withdrew a blowgun from his pouch.</p>

	<p>Crap. This would be bad. I’ll have to be good to get out of this! His weapons are probably poisoned, so I can’t take a hit.</p>

	<p>The scoundrel sent a veritable storm of darts at her from his blowgun. Easily ten, twenty, at insane speed. A common soldier would have quavered in fear. But she was no common soldier, and he was a second too slow, a little too off. She tumbled to one side and seemingly easily parried each dart from the air. No easy task, because they were fired at such a speed that they were like a wave, but each one bounced ringing off her dagger. “Nice trick, girl! You are a credit to your teachers!”
The assassin dropped the now useless blowgun and stood in a fighting stance. It was obviously offensive, the daggers held low and down to the ground.</p>

	<p>She mirrored the stance, with but one variation. She constantly moved her  right dagger, pointed up, in a slow, small triangle-shape. The movement would allow her to parry most attacks with ease.</p>

	<p>“Again, good trick. But the time for play is over!” The rogue launched in and tried to cut her. She blocked, then kicked his groin, grateful for the primary difference between genders, then launched away. But the man didn’t even flinch. He laughed. “Come on, do it again!” He made a face at the poor girl.</p>

	<p>Serious mistake. Jesica gave him the universally recognized sign of insult, then pulled a small pouch from her tunic.</p>

	<p>“I wonder what else is in there....”</p>

	<p>“You’ll never see it, you.....” A word followed that was highly inappropriate. She pulled the stopper off with her teeth, and threw the bottle. A tremendous explosion followed, as the highly flammable liquid inside detonated. The man was knocked off his feet, but he was up again instantly.
But she’d had enough. She leapt up, easily twice her own height, and kicked his shoulder, turning in air like a corkscrew, flipping herself over him with it, and sank the knife into the small of his back. He yelled, turned, and backhanded the girl across the deck, her fragile body ringing from the impact with hard wood. He touched his back, and his hand came away bloody. He grimaced.</p>

	<p>“Curse you.. This was interesting play, you are obviously good. But now I can’t even swim to shore in peace...the sharks will think I’m dinner.”</p>

	<p>“Maybe they’ll leave you alone if you ask nicely.” Jesica grinned wickedly. “The least I can give you for this night’s entertainment is a harrowing swim.”</p>

	<p>“Oh well, girl. Nice fight. Work on your toughness, though. Your speed is great.” </p>

	<p>“You sound like a teacher. Are you concerned?”</p>

	<p>“Just need to have a worthy opponent.”</p>

<p>The man pulled a decanter from his backpack and took a sip of the potion, then faded away.</p>

	<p>Damn. A gate potion. Wonder who hired him?</p>

	<p>Just then, Dirk and Yakov came running up to the deck. Jesica managed to hold herself upright.</p>

	<p>“What happened?” She savored the worry in Dirk’s voice.</p>

	<p>“Oh, nothing. Just an assassin.” She managed to make it sound like nothing at all.</p>

	<p>“WHAT!”</p>

	<p>“CAN’T YOU KEEP OUTTA TROUBLE? Mom and Dad would filet me alive if you got in serious trouble, even in the grave!”</p>

	<p>“SHUT UP, Yak! “ Jesica made a very rude gesture at him.</p>

	<p>“ENOUGH! SHUT YOUR TRAP, BOTH OF YOU. I can see that you’re nervous, so I’m gonna tell you why are here.” Dirk paused.</p>

	<p>“We await you with baited breath.” Yakov quipped.</p>

	<p>“All right. We’re going hunting for that bastard Reaper. He needs to die. Both for my own personal reasons, and the Elves have decided that he’s too much of a pain in the ---. He‘s likely to have a large shadowknight and other troop contingent from Neriak, so that‘s why you are coming along.”</p>

	<p>“Lovely.” Yakov muttered. “So, what are we doing in Freeport?”</p>

	<p>“From what I was told, Yak, there’s a small outpost in the sewers of Freeport of the dark elves. They hire scum, etc, from there.” Dirk paused. “We need to tick the Teir’dal off. So, write off this outpost.”</p>

	<p>“Let me understand this. You want us to take on a small fortress?” Jesica asked. “I’m good, Dirk, but I’m not that good.”</p>

	<p>“When I say outpost, I mean a group of maybe five dark elves, and their pets. It’s not going to be too hard.”</p>

	<p>“Famous last words.”</p>

	<p>The ship pulled into Freeport at that moment.</p>


	<p>Xedri pulled at the amulet for the nth time. She glanced at herself again. A human female‘s appearance. “By Innoruuk, I hate this! I look so......weird! Wrong skin, wrong hair....” But she couldn’t really take it off, so she lay back down in bed again. She heard a yell. Damn drunks.</p>

	<p>Then there was the unmistakable sound of a sword cutting flesh.</p>

	<p>THOSE AREN’T DRUNKS!</p>

	<p>She leapt out of bed, startled. She hastily pulled on her normal clothing and donned her armor. Then she drew out her reforged sword, staring into the ruby blade to give her confidence. But her mind trembled. She was going to find Shadeleaf, and he was going to kill her horribly, and she was going to die, and-.</p>

	<p>Stop these thoughts! This is no good, I’ve no time for foolish fantasies. She gripped the sword in both hands, and raced down the steps into the sewers.</p>

	<p>Inside, the faint green mist obscured most sight, but she could plainly see the two corpses that had once been the bodies of her men. In the wall, a message had been carved.</p>

	<p>‘You don’t belong here. Get out, while you still can.’ The message was slightly bloodstained.</p>

	<p>Xedri shivered. Then, she suddenly heard something. A slamming. She look back. The door was shut and locked. She was trapped.</p>
	<p>Oh crap. She slogged through the muddy water, creeping through tunnels to find the area where another of her little sentry groups had been. She heard a scream. She gasped, cried out “Hold on, I’m coming!” and raced in the direction of the scream.</p>

	<p>What she saw chilled her. The Reaper, Melkor, stood over the bodies of several men. One appeared to be alive. “Come here, girl.” The reaper beckoned with it’s bladed hands. She came. One of her friends appeared to be alive.</p>

	<p>“Yar’at.” She spoke her friend’s name softly, as she removed her disguise amulet. “What happened? Who did this?”</p>

	<p>Yar’at had a gaping wound in his torso. It was too obvious that he needed medical care immediately. But the young shadow knight managed to speak in a rasping, tormented voice. “It......was three people. They were there and then they were gone. They.....” The shadow knight pointed to a couple of crests ripped into the wall. One was a black maple leaf, the other, a black hand surrounded by flaring fires. “There was.....a woman.....and two men....One was the Black Elf. I’m....sorry.....Xedri... I couldn’t take the other man...it was him...” He pointed to a door. “He’s....in there...”</p>

	<p>“I...” She broke off sobbing. “We’ll.....we’ll get you out of here. Come on, Yar’at.”</p>

	<p>Melkor broke in. “No, girl, we won’t.”</p>

	<p>“Are you crazy? He’s going to die!”</p>

	<p>“He will anyway. Girl, do it.”</p>

	<p>“Do what...?” Xedri filled with horror. “No.......”</p>

	<p>“Do what you were trained to do. He’s doomed, so do it!” There was a dreadful hunger in that voice.</p>

	<p>“NO! I will not do it! We can save him!” She stared at the reaper in horror. “No more!”</p>

	<p>“I see......well, Xedri, remember. Your loyalty is in question.......If you don’t do it, I’ll kill you.” Melkor raised it’s claws. “Do it, or I’ll kill you and take you both.”</p>

	<p>Xedri Nightshade looked deep into her friend’s eyes. She read the message there. </p>

	<p>‘Do it. I’m dead, so save yourself. Better you then him.’</p>

	<p>Sobbing, the girl knelt down.  She didn’t think about what she was doing, she just did it. When she raised her body up again, she wiped her lips, still sobbing, as her friend gave a soft gasp and died.  She then wailed out her grief. The reaper looked calmly at her.</p>

	<p>“Lost power of a soul is useless. It is better to utilize it. In time, you’ll come to enjoy it as I do...”It motioned towards the traces of the other two enemies. “I’ll take care of them. Shadeleaf is all yours. Remember, he killed your friend, you just did what had to be done.” Silent, hunting, the Reaper vanished up the stairs, it’s claws raised in anticipation of a kill, it’s rags making little sound.</p>

	<p>Xedri raised her sword, slipped the amulet back on, and slowly walked to the door.  Her vision was red-tinged.<b> He did it. He killed him....</b> She opened the door and walked inside.</p>



	<p>Inside, the small sewer room was filled with fire. Shadeleaf had apparently set fire to all the possible supplies in this room, and a silhouette of a tall wood elf stood in the area in front of the raging blaze. “Why are you here? This has nothing to do with you.”</p>

	<p>“This has everything to do with me, “ Xedri spat. She removed the amulet. Shadeleaf hissed.

	<p>“You. It’s you. You recovered quickly. Still drinking blood, as I can see from your mouth?”</p>

	<p>“You....you killed him. You murderer!”</p>

	<p>Shadeleaf turned around. His face was harsh, slightly scarred on the right side. His eyes were the most salient thing about him. They glowed as lightning flowed through them, constantly. “Murderer? Oh no, girl. I don’t deny I fought him, nor that I beat him. But he was alive when I left him. I’m not a butcher.” His voice was calm, reasonable, and devoid of guilt.</p>

	<p>Shadeleaf’s calm, rational words enraged Xedri. “You doomed him! And you’ll do the same to me!”</p>

	<p>Shadeleaf started. “Oh...my god. That......is his?” He shuddered, and a blazing fire of hate came into his face. “You monster! You, you’re no better then that bastard Reaper!” He reached down to the ground, and pulled two swords from it. One was engraved with a black maple leaf, the sword he’d used before. The other was a simple, long, elegant design. “ You will pay for defiling his soul. En garde!”</p>

	<p>A second before the two blades would have sliced her in two, Xedri parried with her ruby blade. “You may have had no respect for him, but respect me, you honorless pile of scum!” She swung the sword up, and Shadeleaf easily spun out of the way of the stroke. “I’ll play with you like you played with him! You left him there!”</p>

	<p>“That was mercy, girl!” The wood elf raised both blades, then cleaved down, as they impacted on her raised sword blade. “You’re doing better. I can see why...have you no heart?”</p>

	<p>“I did what I had to do! It was the right thing to do!” Xedri screamed. She ripped up the blade, and the ranger swatted it down. He laughed.</p>

	<p>“Deceive yourself, huh? It will do you no good. You know what you did to him, and you know what I did. You didn’t have to do it.” He spun like a whirlwind around, blades like a maelstrom of death, as Xedri was forced to use her blade as a barrier. “Your friend may have been not as good as I may be, but he fought with honor. You have no honor, but are just a defiler of everything on this world! No wonder you are stationed with the Reaper.”</p>

	<p>“.....Oh, you blame it on others? I’ll show you!” Xedri evaded his rapid strokes unharmed, and grabbed his wrist. Her hate flowed through her hands and into his body, as a stream of dark energy.</p>

	<p>He screamed, and dropped to the ground, violently in seizures.  Xedri watched with a kind of sick fascination. That wasn’t normal....no one was affected that bad! The ranger finally got control of his own body, and glared hatefully at the woman. His eyes turned a searing, bright blue. “Two can play at that game, girl!” He raised both sword blades, then thunderous noise filled the room as Xedri was struck by a lightning bolt. Her body flew back, her mind in agony. She clambered to her feet, pain flowing through her like a river. Hate poured through them both, as the struggle intensified. </p>

	<p>Eventually driven beyond even her punched-up endurance, the shadow knight screamed in pure hate. She raised her blade like an axe. But it was a bad move, and Shadeleaf swung his blade in towards her throat. Their eyes met, and neither stroke ever fell.  Suddenly, both combatants simply stopped, dead still, as if they’d been paralyzed. Shadeleaf opened his mouth, and gathered breath for what he was about to say. </p>
	<p>“.......I can’t kill you. I don’t know why, but I can’t. You’ve been given the gift of life. Use it well, girl.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll finish this with you later.” the shadow knight managed to say through suddenly stiff lips. “But, I swear.........unless I hear it from him himself, I will avenge Yar’at. I promise you that. “</p>

	<p>Shadeleaf sighed. “Don’t you understand? Your friend didn’t die by my hand. If at anyone’s hands but yours, he died at the hands of the Reaper. Remember that.” The ranger quietly moved out of the room, leaving Xedri to stare.</p>

	
	<p>Dirk moved quietly through the upper rooms of the building. He wasn’t any sort of stealth expert, so his degree of quiet involved a large amount of clanking.</p>
	<p>“Can’t you be any quieter?” the rogue muttered to him.</p>

	<p>“Armor makes noise, Jesi. I can’t change that.” </p>

<p>They moved throughout the building, but nothing was there. Dirk suddenly felt a chill. “Jesica, this is an ambush. There is something wrong, just wrong! We need to get out of here!”</p>

	<p>“Too late,” the voice of Melkor, the Reaper, boomed. “Now, what do we have here? A wood elf girl and the Black Elf. Not the best spot for a date, my little friends.”  His foul shape emerged from the shadows. Dirk heard Jesica’s breath catch in her throat. </p>

	<p>“Melkor, there’s no reason for you to die just yet. Leave the girl alone.”</p>

	<p>“Ah, but I’m thirsty, Black Elf, dreadfully thirsty.” It’s maw opened and shut. “She looks sweet.”</p>

	<p>“High praise from a Reaper..” the rogue muttered. </p>

	<p>“Tell me, little girl, do you know what Dirk really is? Your good friend......but he and I share an origin, girl.” Jesica’s face whitened at the Reaper’s words.</p>

	<p>“Liar.” Dirk screamed. “Now, Melkor, when the time comes, I shall make you suffer for your crimes! But now is not the time, foul being. Begone.”</p>

	<p>“Since when do I listen to you, Black Elf, tainted paladin?”</p>

	<p>“Since I can MAKE you leave, by force, if need be. And you know this isn’t the time or the place for a fight.“</p>

	<p>“Too true, young paladin. But I’m fairly sure the only one that needs to be there then is you....nothing about the rest. “</p>

	<p>“Fine, then. It’s me and you, then. But leave them alone, or else.” Dirk raised his gauntleted hand slightly. The reaper did not miss the gesture. “And I swear, my half-ling blood will prove more effective then your usurped power when the time comes.”</p>

	<p>Then Dirk kicked open the glass window, grabbed the stunned woman beside him, and leapt out the window, covering their path with a single beam of light directed at the reaper. They met Yakov in an alleyway, and were gone. </p>
