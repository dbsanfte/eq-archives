  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p>A question was posed recently that asked if playing a paladin at high levels worth it. The following is an attempt to address that question and help players get the most out of their paladin. The following suggestions are for 39+ paladins but can be used as a general guide.<br>
<br>
I play a paladin (currently level 45) and enjoy it very much. There are some downsides that I will address first.<br>
<br>
1. Getting a group -- Can sometimes be difficult in higher level areas since 2 slots are usually taken by a cleric and enchanter. At least one and usually 2 casters, while leaving only a couple spots for tanks. One of these spots will go to a warrior deservedly so as main tank. This altogether leads to only maybe one or 2 spots where a paladin would even be considered.<br>
<br>
2. A bit of prejudice towards unknown paladins -- Undoubtedly when anyone discusses the paladin class, or any other for that matter, the following statement comes up: Well if you know how to play your
class, then you can be a benefit to the group. Someone posted in an earlier post that it takes a bit of talent to play a hybrid well and I would agree. If someone
doesn't know you, and you are a paladin, the chances of you getting in the group are less than if you once saved the group leaders life with LOH, or held the mob back while the group zoned, or basically just did something helpful, which as a paladin you should do. In a nutshell, learn to play, and then do it. Eventually your reputation will
out damage your hybrid penalties like a wurmslayer on a silvery axe.<br>
<br>
3. Soloing -- I have seen other paladins say that they can solo effectively at a high level, but I am not one of them. With some high end gear and the right situation I am sure it is possible, but as a paladin post
level 35, you are going to spend the vast majority of your time in a group setting.<br>
<br>
Now that I have addressed some of the things that make paladins difficult to play, let me talk about a few of the things that I think we excel in and make the paladin class a wonderful choice.<br>
<br>
1. Group Downtime -- This is another thing that is always mentioned but it is so true and perhaps our biggest asset. With the recent increase in hybrid mana pools, we now have the same amount of a cleric with the same stats. This was a boon to the cleric class. Now that we have more mana to use,
use it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you are in a group that is handling things fairly well then offer to cast your symbol so the cleric can save the plat for his more expensive symbol. Talk to the cleric and ask him/her how you can be a benefit to him. If the cleric wants you to heal after fights so he can save mana, then by all means do it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If I am in a group situation and a mob has just been killed, and anyone is a bubble or two bubbles from full health, I will heal them. The cleric is not going to until its time for CH for the most part, if you do these small heals, you are saving mana for the cleric. In many instances the cleric will never have to use his CH because you keep the PC above the usual 2
bubble CH line.<br>
<br>
Keep utility buffs like Invigor, Counteract Poison, Cancel Magic memmed and others depending on the situation. In a group setting, the cleric is
going to use his armor and shield buffs because they are better. As a tank you will be privy to these buffs as well, so there is no need for you to have yours memmed. Replace them with the above spells or ones needed for the situation. Even if you only use one of them once, you are proving yourself to be more valuable to the group than
probably anyone thought you could be.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Another thing you must do is keep your eyes on your casters. I don't think I have used LOH on a tank since I was in my 20's but I have used them on casters many times over since then. The reason is simple, casters, and especially you frail enchanters out there, have fewer HP's. This makes the CH or the SH that is coming from the main healer even more important in
it's timing. If it is just the least bit late, it could spell death to the caster in question, which could in turn cause death the entire group. LOH will be a CH to a caster of
comparative level and is rarely interrupted. Talk to your cleric ahead of time in tells and decide when you are going to use LOH. I cast LOH when the last
bubble is breached on a caster. If you step on your clerics CH, then so be it, the caster is going to live regardless. That is much better than the alternative.<br>
<br>
All the above things will help speed up your group kill rate which will take care of this phantom
damage penalty I often hear of but have never seen concrete proof of, and will in all likelihood raise your faction with the group. Our key is our versatility, do not be afraid to show it.<br>
<br>
2. Stun (The spell and the usage of it) -- Everyone knows that stun will interrupt a caster mob. At my present level I only have one stun spell and it is probably my most used spell. It has many uses such as the following:<br>
<br>
A. As stated before, it will interrupt casting. Priceless and easy to understand.<br>
<br>
B. Great to pull with especially on caster mobs. In places such as guk you can pull a caster mob with stun and get out of
it's line of sight, thereby decreasing the damage it is going to do to you, and decreasing the chances you will need to be healed. Now of course this
isn't always an option but it is nice to be able to pull the mob and get back to the camp without your skin igniting a few times.<br>
<br>
C. Stopping Mob from attacking -- The following won't work on giants and other mobs of that type, but still is effective. If mana allows, while tanking, STUN the mob. The mob will not attack for 2 seconds while the rest of the group hits it. Granted, this is not a huge help but it
is a help. Since we do not do the damage of other melee classes the time taken to cast the stun spell is made up by the
damage not taken by the group as a whole.<br>
<br>
D. Stopping a mob in its tracks -- This is another use that is not always needed but can be helpful. If you have no one darking or snaring in your group, when the mob starts to run, things can get dicey. Learn when the mob is going to run and stun accordingly. Once the casters in your group see what you are doing, they will time their Nukes in accordance so as to finish the mob before it can get too far.<br>
<br>
3. Undead -- It's very simple. The Ghoulbane is an awesome weapon against undead. Paladins are more accepted in these settings. I
recommend LGuk to all paladins over level 30. You may just find your home in that dark, twisting place.<br>
<br>
Using your GB as main weapon and a nice shield along with the tactics above will have you in the good graces of many group leaders very quickly.<br>
<br>
4. Righteousness -- As a paladin of Norrath, you are a servant of your God. You are the protector of your people. Now excluding a race/class combo here and there, for the most part you are the Good Guy, so act like it.<br>
<br>
Make yourself attentive and readily available to the group. Don't fall into the 'I'm just a
meat shield' mentality and just hit assist and attack and then space for 45 seconds. Watch for who gets poisoned and cure them. Watch for who is diseased and cure them. Watch for someone who may be having trouble with a situation and if you think you have some info they might need, then TELL them. But do so in a paladin fashion. One of compassion and helpfulness will often get the result you desire.<br>
<br>
Do the dirty jobs. Be the list holder. Be the master looter. But above all be honest in whatever your capacity is. Make yourself an asset to the group. When you leave that group, you want people to say,
'Oh do you really have to go?', not just, 'Ok man c ya'. That is the difference of being invited again and being kept out the next time.<br>
<br>
5. Preparedness -- A paladin not only CAN play many roles within Everquest, he MUST play these roles and he MUST play them well. I
recommend carrying a few pieces of different gear with you for the different situations that you will face.<br>
<br>
A. Mana Gear -- It is not difficult to do and should be affordable by level 40 which is when you begin to use your mana more. Get a set of Adamantine Epolets to wear for the wis bonus. Perhaps a couple 6 wis rings, and you can always equip your soulfire if you have one for a quick 7 wis bonus.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
B. Undead Fighting -- For those undead times. Dex gear becomes the key. Carnal Pauldrons, 5dex/str rings, and perhaps a lumberjacks cap will make you proc that GB more than without them. That 162 DD is the most you are ever
going to do DD so might as well get it off as much as possible.<br>
<br>
C. Live Tanking -- As far as straight AC and HP go, your buffs are adequate, and in group will be getting the better line of them from cleric, save the symbol perhaps depending on your arrangement.<br>
<br>
D. The Right Weapon -- Weapons are plentiful but I recommend a 1h slash whenever possible. Having a shield equipped will not only raise your AC but will give you one more chance to interrupt NPC casters, besides the
damage you do with bash anyway which can add up.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I would recommend having at least 2 swords with you at all times. Your live sword and your dead sword. The GB is used of course for undead, which you often run into in the course of live mobs. There have been many times where I have switched weapons according to pulls. All you need to do is pay attention to the incoming message and if the inc message is not sufficient to make this decision, then talk to the puller. Ask them nicely and they will be able to tell you live or dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I am sorry for the length but I kind of got on a roll and this post has turned into a How To according to Laszlo. Please take it as intended, merely suggestion. I did not intend to come off as if to say this is how you must play to be successful. These are merely things that I have incorporated into my playing style that have brought me success and enjoyment, and I hope they might do the same for you.<br>
<br>
I think the question at the beginning of this was Is it worth it to play a paladin at higher levels. To this I have a simple response.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Yes it is<br>
