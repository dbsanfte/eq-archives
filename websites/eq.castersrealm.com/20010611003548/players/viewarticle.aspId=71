Ch. 2  


<p>Xellen spent that first night at the Guildhouse cold and damp.  No fires were spent to warm the confines, and Xellen had no blanket, only the robe given to him by his new guardians.  Shivering, and alone in the dark, he regretted nothing of what happened to his father.  The man had always been cruel, and uncaring towards the boy.  While this wasn’t uncustomary in Teir’dal society, Xellen’s father seemed to deal out punishment to the two boys for any failure that he himself had brought on.  Xellen fell asleep, wondering about what was happening with his brother.</p>

<p>Before the “sun” of Neriak had a chance to rise, Xellen was pulled to his feet by another robed brother.  Whether this particular man, or woman was one of the same that had rescued him from the trial, Xellen couldn’t tell.  The figure merely pulled him roughly to his feet and beckoned for the boy to follow.  The figure lead Xellen through a maze of corridors, never speaking a word, and never slowing or looking back to see if the boy was indeed behind them.  As rough, blue stoned walls gave way to a worked brick passage, Xellen began to wonder about the scope of the area he was in.</p>  

<p>For certain, he was in some sort of guildhall, but he was unsure which one, he’d seen no one, nor spoken to anyone since his arrival.  Is this some sort of prison?  What do they want from me, and why did they take me away, claiming the Queen’s edict?  Xellen’s pace grew steadily slower, as his anticipation of what lay in store for him.  A child’s imagination ran wild, and he imagined a grizzly execution awaiting the end of this long journey, but still he continued onward, realizing that he really had no idea where he was at the moment, nor any idea how he might escape, should he want to anyway.  Soon, Xellen heard other voices, talking from another room, or perhaps a common area.  The figure leading him didn’t slow to let Xellen investigate, despite the few doors that Xellen did pass along the way.  The hallway they followed opened into a larger area, filled with the exotic plants commonly found in Neriak, and the Nektulos Forest.  Xellen nearly stopped, stunned. The room was huge!  Trees of various sizes filled the room, along with mushrooms, and other odd vine like plants.  Gape mouthed, Xellen continued, staring at the foliage in awe and wonder.  The plants seemed so much more lush that the plants he’d seen on his brief trips to Nektulos.  Xellen almost didn’t notice that his guide had come to a stop near a slightly overgrown hedge in time to avoid bumping into him.</p>  

<p>“Let this be the first lesson, child.” A voice emerged from the other side of the hedge.  “Always from death, comes more vibrant life.”  Xellen heard someone stand, and brush their hands free of anything that may be clinging to them.  “Come around the hedge, child, let me get a look at you.”</p>

<p>Xellen obeyed, and after coming around the hedge, saw a thin, muscular dark elf, wearing a plain green robe, which was slightly dirty from the soil the man had obviously been working with.  The elf looked down at Xellen, his emerald green eyes boring into the boy.  Xellen felt uncomfortable under the weight of that stare, feeling as though he was being measured against some unforeseen scale.</p>  

<p>“Not much to you, is there Xellen?” The boy looked up, shocked, and meeting the older elf’s gaze with his own for the first time.  Xellen’s eyes were locked with the man’s, and he couldn’t pull them away, although he longed for nothing more at the moment.  The older man chuckled “Yes, I know who you are, and more importantly, what you’ve done.” His gaze bore more forcefully into the young boy’s eyes, “Now tell me, do you regret what you have done?”</p>

<p>Xellen’s mind raced through the possibilities.  Of course he didn’t regret it, even if he wasn’t quite sure how he’d done it, yet what if this was trick, a trap laid to get him to admit that he’d murdered his father.  “Yes, I am sorry tha…” the man’s move was so sudden that Xellen didn’t see the blow, but he felt the penetrating chill of the Elf’s touch driving him to his knees, leaving him breathless, and weak.</p>

<p>“Never lie to me!” the elf’s countenance glowed a slight greenish color, as power receded.  “That was a touch of what I will do to you, should it happen again.  Each lie, each falsehood will cost you bits of your life, do you understand?”</p>

<p>Xellen began to answer, but stopped weighing his answer.  The lad slowly climbed to his feet and this time looked the older elf in the eyes. “No.” The elf began to strike a gain, his hand with a sickly green glow cast about it.  “I don’t understand how you can drain my life!”  Xellen stood defiantly, as defiantly as a young child can in the face of an angry adult.</p>

<p>The older man stopped his strike, and smiled, then laughed at Xellen.  “Well spoken, child.  Well spoken indeed.”  The elf made an awkward motion with his hand and the energy was released.  “I am Taren X’aell, I am to be your master while you are housed within the walls of the Dark Brotherhood.”  Taren looked to the robed figure that had led Xellen to him.  “You may go Trellahan, the boy will live, and learn, for now.”</p>

<p>Trellahan bowed, and turned, as silently as he had come, he left, leaving the boy and the older elf alone in the garden.  Taren ran his hands over a few lush leaves, and turned to face Xellen.  “Tell me what you see, boy.”</p>

<p>Xellen shrugged “A lush garden, that rivals any that I’ve ever seen”</p>

<p>“Bah…you look with a commoner’s eyes.  Look again, and tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>“A lush garden with several different species, well cared for, and tended, with rich soil…”  Xellen ended the comment with a gasp, as he felt a wrenching cold twist in his guts.  Turning in agony he looked upon Taren, and saw the sickly green aura surround the older elf, and he saw something else.  The fire in Taren’s eyes seemed to grow stronger.  Taren was feeding upon Xellen’s life!</p>

<p>Taren ended the spell with a twist of his wrist, and grabbed Xellen by his collar, staring down at the boy.  “Look again, and if you give me a lazy answer a third time, you will think what you just felt was a sweet dream!”  Specks of spittle flew from the incensed Necromancer’s lips and hit Xellen, the moistness a shame that burned Xellen like acid.</p>

<p>Anger flashed into Xellen’s eyes, and hatred for his new master surged into him…and he saw.  All around him he saw it.  The life force of every tree, every bush, each insect and small creature.  Like silver traces of fire liming the leaves and bodies of everything.  Xellen could see which plants thrived and which plants choked under the malaise of death’s grip.  He turned to Taren and saw the same silver fire, but with blue and red motes running through, warping his teacher’s features into some macabre caricature of a Teir’dal.  “I see…silverfire on everything living, and blackness on those things dead.  You are…different.  Other colors mark your features.”  Xellen looked up at Taren, as his vision resumed normalcy.  “What does it mean?”</p>

<p>Taren chuckled, and looked down at the lad.  “You see, when you overcome your mundane upbringing, you can look beyond.  You have talent, boy.  Rare talent indeed.  What you see is the life force of all things living around you.  Some stronger than others.  The black that you see is a life that has gone beyond to a different existence.  Someday you will learn how to reach beyond that veil, and pull back some of the essence of those departed.  Then you will know the true might of the Necromancer.  For now, you have taken your first step to understanding.  You make strides, Xellen, do not be so stubborn as to only rely on your mundane senses.  Use those gifts given you, and develop them.  In this way you will advance amongst your classmates, and thrive.  If you do not, if you fall back to not reaching, you will fail, and the Dark Brotherhood, does not tolerate failure.  Look to the soil of this garden, Xellen, and tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>Xellen stared at the grounds of the garden, and saw nothing.  Anger welled within him, and like a dam bursting he once again saw into that realm of life force.  Staring down at the ground, he saw faint traces of silver, red and blue.  “I see lifeforce in the soil, much like your own.”  Xellen was confused, had Taren imbued this soil with his own life?</p>

<p>“Remember well, Xellen, that the most vibrant life, most often comes from death.  Failure is not tolerated here.”</p>

<p>Xellen swallowed hard.  He knew the source of the faint traces of life in the soil.  The Dark Brotherhood did not tolerate failure, and yet no one that had ever failed the Necromancer’s guild had ever walked the streets of Neriak to tell about it.</p>
