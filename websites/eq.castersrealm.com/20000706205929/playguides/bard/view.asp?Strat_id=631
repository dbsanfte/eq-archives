    --That Stupid Glass,
The Best and Worst of Bards--


---Any one who’s played a Bard in a group has heard it: “Play the Heal Song” or “Play the Buff Song” or, at Higher Levels, my favorite, “Play the Mana Song.”  Every one seems to think they are a Bard.  Yet they constantly complain: “What do those blue sparkles do? Do they heal?” and “You don’t have enough Hp to tank, we’re always healing you!”  As the old saying goes, “Is the glass half empty, or half full?”--

--In the case of Bards, it’s half full.  Who else can Tank, Buff, Heal, Speed you up, Slow enemies down, and carry a tune?  Last time I checked – No One.  So how do we fun dispel all those rumors about us being “Sorta Tanks”?  We show off what we can do (often better than anyone else!) and we let people see it: He’s how.--

--Strut our stuff.  That’s what we have to do – we need to stand out there, use our skills and songs, talents and tricks, and a tad bit of craziness.  We need to use our abilities in ways other classes can’t or choose not to.  Below is Advice: you can follow it to the letter, and it will work (more or less) or you can see the Ideas behind it, grab that idea, and run with it as far as it will go.  In any case, may these tips guide you in your travails throughout Norrath.--

--On instruments.  Bards are song weavers, and we need to be our own band.  Always, always, always carry a Stringed and a Percussion instrument!  While common “Lute” and “Hand Drum” will effect your songs (in some cases a lot)  there are in Norrath magical instruments as well.  Seeing as even the two most common ones, The Lute of the Gypsy Princess, and Mistmoore Battel Drums sell for well over 1,000 platinum, you won’t be seeing them till your Higher levels.  Yet before you start eyeing those Lambent pieces, or a new weapon, consider these first, as they will change some of your most used songs dramatically.--

--Grabbing the critters and keeping them.  Your 12th level direct damage Song, Brusco’s Boastful Bellow, is not a very good DD (Sadly, nor are your later DDs.)  So don’t use it as one!  Offer to pull the target to save the warrior some time and trouble.  Instead of running up to it, whacking it with a sword in true tank fashion, stand back a few paces (or, better yet, a lot of paces) and bellow at it.  You get some nice distance to run back to the group (often untouched) where the Tanks can take over.  --

--Softening up the baddies.  Remember the golden rule of Songs: You can sing while running.  After your first bellow, and the damage message shows up, reclick the gem (the time it takes to “reset” is a waist) and fire off another while running (backwards if possible) to your group.  You can often get two or even three bellows off before you get to your party.--

--You’re not the Tank. Unless all else fails, never ever be the main Tank, especially if there is a Paladin, Rogue, or Shadow Knight in the group.  This isn’t because you can’t Tank, it’s because you shouldn’t let them know you can.  I’ve grouped with the same people for days and days, taking my share of the damage.  Then suddenly the warrior dies, there’s three things attack me, and I’m more or less Ok!  Let them see that you can Tank, if you want or need to.--

--Let them laugh at you - when the warrior is in Crafted and the mage is in a Robe of the Oracle - and you have Banded  armor.  Even though it’s not as flashy as what others might have it will protect you none the less and it is extremely light.  
Even though you may be tempted to buy Bronze armor, Bards aren’t the strongest of people out there, and by sacrificing three or four AC over the whole suit of armor, the weight the Banded saves you is by far worth it.  --

--Healing your party is one of the thing people are the most uninformed about.  All they see if blue sparkles, and if they haven’t filtered it out, the “your wounds begin to heal” message.  You are Healing them every tic (with approximately 12 to 15 tics per minute.)  If you use your Lute, you Heal them three damage per tic standing, four damage per tic sitting.  With a Magic Lute, this can be doubled or tripled.  If any one asks, don’t say it’s a “Healing Song”, say it is a “Regenerating Song,” as that is far close to what it does.  Despite of rumors, you can not “Stack” the healing effect of two or more Bards.--

--Under the river and over the hills.  Bards have more travailing “Utilities” than a vacuum. Often overlooked are our Underwater Breathing Song, Tarew’s Aquatic Ayre, 16th Level; our Levitation Song, Agilmente’s Aria of Eagles, 31st Level; and our Invisibility Song, Shauri’s Sonorous Clouding, 19th Level.  These three songs can’t be effectively “Twisted” (see below) but are still extremely useful.  --

--Out running Spirit of Wolf.  From the day you started played, you’ve seen people shouting for Spirit of Wolf (SoW) for body retrieving, cross country travail.  Yet, when you got Selo’s Eccelerando at 5th Level, no one was begging for it. The Song’s major downfall is that you must be in the Bard’s group to get the effects.  But when you do, you sure do!  It has been proven time and again that a Bard with a simple “Hand Drum” using their “Speed Song” can easily out run SoW !  Using a Magic Drum, You can travail up to twice as fast as SoW.  Once some one has run with a magical drum-wielding Bard, they’ll never want to run across the Karanas with out a Minstrel again.--

--Bending Enchanter’s minds.  When an Enchanter hits 29th Level, every one knows he can cast Clarity, and he can make a handsome chunk of platinum casting it for Donations.  Yet enchanters aren’t the only ones who can make that pesky Mana come back far faster.  Seemingly unknown (and this surprises me to high heck, considering hoe casters complain about Mana.) Bards’ 32nd Level Song, Cassindra’s Chorus of Clarity, has a very similar, and extremely pleasing effect.  It Brings back “X” amount of Mana per tic, depending on level and skill.  Rumors of 50th Level Bards bringing back 30-45 Mana per tic (12 to 15 tics per minute) to a full group with three or four casters may very well be true.  --

--Bards will be Bards, so have fun out there!  Use Invisibility, Levitate, Safefall, and all your other talents to play around, and even play a practical joke or two.  There’s a million and five things you can do to goof off, and that’s what bards were born and raised to do. Get up and Dance.  Say “Full Mana” when the casters are OOM.  Sing nonsense words to go with your songs. Hum to yourself.  Say “Hail a Undead Killer Shark” when on the boat.  If they ask what’s wrong with you, just say “I’m a Bard” and Smile to yourself.--

--Remember, even though people think they know everything about Bards, they don’t.  When you join a group, tell the Healers not to worry after battles, you have it covered.  Tell them you can pull, but won’t Tank.  Let them know they can save Mana on SoW, your Faster.  The more they know, the more they can tell their friends.  That’s the only was the mysteries and rumors shadowing Bards can be removed.  --

--In Closing, I would just like to say that bards don’t “Suck at everything.”  They aren’t “Great at one thing” … we’re just “Darn Good at a bunch of Lil’ Things.”--
