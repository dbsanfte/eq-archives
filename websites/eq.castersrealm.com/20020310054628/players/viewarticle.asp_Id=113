“<i>You have invoked the power which had been ordained that you not call upon,</i>”  rung a deep mental voice within Simonic’s head.<p>
     “<i>The realms needed it</i>.” protested himself.<p>
     “<i>Speak thus to the Tribune.</i>”<p>
     Pain shot through his body being tugged by an unseen force, as he screamed out into the night.  Before his body was sucked from land’s of Norrath.  Leaving a scared Dorson staring at where his friend was just a second before.  As Dorson turned his gaze back towards the man, Serivok, he felt fiery eye’s pierce through him.  He was enthralled.<p>
     Dorson stared absently into eyes which seemed to burn into his own.  An urge to run rose up within him, but he could not move.  His muscles ached to stretch, but they would not.  He was utterly frozen to the man’s gaze.  Forced to watch as he floated upon waves of flames in his direction.  Closing the distance between him and the stunned druid.  Dorson used a muscle that was able to move, and with it, he gulped hard.<p>
     Dorson’s eyes lifted up to meet the gaze of Serivok, who was wrapped in rushing flames roaming over his pale skinned body.  His eyes seemed to be of fire, swaying within his sunken in sockets, but even within the torrent of flames, Dor thought he noticed an eyebrow raise.<p>
     “Young one, was that Ithyl?” Serivok’s voice sounded clear and deep, not the menacing tone it was moments before.<p>
     Fumbling for words, and finally not able to find them, Dor shook his head that it wasn’t Ithyl.  Serivok, however, didn’t seem to believe him.  As flames were sent around him, burning some of his leather onto his skin.  Air finally reached his mouth, as he let loose a loud cry falling onto the ground.  Serivok grinned down at his writhing body while it squirmed as if to escape the engulfing flames.<p>
     “Now, again, was that Ithyl?” he growled out at the young druid. <p>
     “Serivok, leave the child alone, now.” stated a sharp higher toned voice.<p>
     Through blurry eyes that burned Dorson saw the silhouette of a halfling.  Serivok spun around in the air and glared down at a halfling, bearing dark chained armor wielding two daggers, everything about him was covered in blood.  Light danced about the Halflings eyes as he glared up at the Guardian. <p>
     “Child, I do not have time to play games of <i>heros</i>, now run along and go beat on some bixies and the like,” grumbled out Serivok, sounding annoyed, to say the least.<p>
     The halfling eyed the floating man as he turned back around resuming his efforts of pain upon the young druid, who’s screams rose up once again.  Kneeling down the halfling withdrew a small dagger from his boot, and hurled it toward the back of the mage.  As it flew, the fire cleared a path for it letting it hit the bare back of Serivok.  As it hit, blood squirted out, letting the dagger be eaten to half it’s length.  Sending Serivok into a rigid stiffness, as roaring flames bit hard into the metal burning it to dark ash.<p>
     Eyes scorching with pain spun around, sending silver hair twisting within the flames.  A look of pain and surprised creased his face as his hands were in the gestures of a spell.  But before he could finish, the halfling leapt into the air and sent a quick slash against the chest of Serivok.  A cut where the blade had touched, began to leak out blood, causing the mage to fall to his feet letting the fires die down about him, and the druid.<p>
     “Is it so soon?”  Serivok walked calmly in a circle about the halfling, “that the god’s have sent out avatars to stop one of their own creations?”  With a simple gesture, a robe dark midnight colored robe flashed about him, as a long sword formed into his hands. <p>
     “You had no right to hide from us, nor did you have the right to return without our consent.”  He smoothly withdrew the dagger’s at his waist and glared at the blade in the mage’s hands.<p>
     “You know, Bristlebane, the Guardian’s have the power to challenge even the god’s themselves.”<p>
     Serivok began to take a step closer to the halfling avatar of Bristlebane, who awaited an attack if he didn’t see an opening, quick.  It opened.<p>
     “May Innoruuk send you to Saryrn!” growled out the avatar, before he made a lightning quick lunge at the mage.<p>
     Serivok brought his blade, at matching speed, and met the halfling’s dagger, a moment before the other dagger flashed from the other side.  Serivok twisted, letting the stab miss his back, and then tilted his blade on the dagger, lifting it up and brought it at the avatar’s face.  The avatar ducked, and struck his dagger out at Serivok’s right leg.  <p>
     Quickly, Serivok lifted his leg, and jabbed it down on the arm of the avatar who was already bringing his other arm above him and stab the mage in the gut.  Serivok stepped back, and slashed the dagger aimed for his stomach, allowing the other dagger to strike out again nicking the edge of his robes, yet no flesh.<p>
     Bristlebane’s avatar sent another assault upon the mage.  A right slash come from above, as a lower left jab came from beneath.  Serivok brought his blade up and knocked the one heading for his head, and spoke a quick word allowing another sword to form in his left hand, in time for him to deflect the jab.  The avatar growled, and retreated a few paces back.  Both began to breath heavily, as small beads of sweat were forming at their brows.<p>
     “I have not done this in ages!” cried the mage excitedly while not taking his eye of the halfling.<p>
     “Dorson, stand and leave this place child!” the avatar spoke to the young man he knew was on the ground a few yards away, most likely watching the battle in awe.<p>
     Dorson seemed to snap out of it, he had been amazed at how the mage addressed Sekerv.  He had never thought that Ebon’s personal scout was an Avatar of Bristlebane, but perhaps that was the reason for his extreme skill in the craft.  Not wanting to upset a god, he stood and ran in the direction of the fire elemental, following a trail of burned smoking foliage, to Erudin.<p>
     As he ran off, Sekerv made a quick check in the direction.  A bad move.  Serivok was atop him in a flurry of blades.  Sekerv dodged a few, and blocked the rest, but the attacks would not cease as slashes found his upper arm and mid thighs.  Finally, he saw an opening in the mage’s style, and took it.  With a quick dodge of a blade, the avatar drove the dagger deep into the under arm of Serivok, who in turn growled in pain.  Speaking a violent word, Sekerv’s body was jolted with extreme power and flown back towards a tree thirty yards away.<p>
     The tree greeted the avatar with unmoving joy, causing Sekerv to cough up blood and lull his head about for a few moments.  Moments that Serivok was taking to walk closer to the avatar, while he held his left under-arm.  As he approached he removed the hand, dripping with blood and spoke another word, calling forth a black blade of swirling energies.  Sekerv gasped, it was a gasp of a halfling.<p>
     “That coward!” roared Serivok as he charged at the stunned halfling.<p>
     The surprised Sekerv threw two daggers he had found within his hands up at the oncoming man with silver trailing hair and eyes that seemed to burn.  Their flight flew through the air and struck the charging stranger dead on in the chest.  They did nothing more than ricochet off.  Terror seized his eyes and it were those eyes that remained as his head rolled beside the tree, as a burning blade lifted up before the mage.  The black energies seemed to feed of the blood it had just tasted, as it pulsed with a crimson red alongside it’s normal blackness.<p>
     “Is the death of the innocent what the god’s wish?  Destroying the will of one’s follower, only to abandon him when you have failed?”  Serivok looked sadly down at the corpse, eyeing the headless halfling, once avatar then turned again to his true self, growling he cried out as he stared into the swirling mass of oncoming thunder storms ahead “May the gods be damned!”<p>

<center>**********************************************</center><p>

          The pain quickly subsided as his body no longer felt as if it were going to be ripped apart by unseen force.  Giving him enough time to glance about him, taking in his surroundings.  The sky was grey, setting the mood of dullness.  As he eyed those about him, he sat in the center of a huge coliseum, before him about five stories above him, sat six cloaked figures.  <p>
     The six figures were all draped in dark cloaks of either black or brown, he couldn’t tell from this viewpoint, but he didn’t think it would matter anymore.  He was within the Plane of Justice, ruled by the six men that now were before him, the Tribunal.  Sighing slowly, he remained still and awaited his case to be spoken of.  His wait had only lasted a few moments before they spoke.<p>
     “Your charge, Ithyl, Guardian of Norrath, of the House of Kinrock, Elder of Hulok, and firstborn to Kron, is one of a severe nature.  Were you not told that you would not be permitted to cast any such spells, that required a guardian’s power, when the destruction of your Empire took place?” stated a monotonous voice, from one of the six.  <p>
     “I was, Tribunal.” Simonic answered to the Tribune above him.<p>
     “And, did you not break such an oath this day?” stated the same monotonous voice, yet it seemed from a different point on the board.<p>
     “The realms needed it, Tribune.”<p>
     “State why they needed it, Ithyl.”<p>
     “A great sorcerer was about to be slain.” replied Simonic, obviously not wanting to answer these questions.<p>
     “It was his mistake, not a reason for you to call upon the powers of the gods to save one life.”  Yet, again, in the same tone.<p>
     “The Diz’Urian is back upon the realms, and he drove me to cast such a spell.”  As he spoke those words, the Tribune seemed to halt.  <p>
     Hours flew by, or even days, weeks, months.  The Tribunal just sat there, as if in deep thought, until silence was broken by a man forming about the room behind Simonic, who was kneeling from either exhaustion or prayer.  As the planes often sent one into a fit of praises to the gods.  Steel plated boots walked towards the mage.<p>
     “Mithaniel Marr, this is a private jury, and you were not asked to come, nor would you have been asked on such important matters.  Please exit immediately from our planes and we will not need to use force.”  Came an unison of voices from the Tribunal.<p>
     Simonic turned his head around and saw a tall man armored in glistening armor, it’s color seemed to be white, but that could have been from the brilliant reflections it gave off.  At his belt a longsword rested in it’s given place, though even it’s scabbard glowed with radiant power.  Silver hair draped down across his shoulders, much like that of Simonic’s and Serivok’s hair fell and looked.  This was the god of valor himself, and the creator of Ithyl, turned Simonic.<p>
     “Tribune, this matter is far deeper than that of a petty injustice, if that’s what you wish to lie upon him you will have Brell to speak to first.” Marr leveled his gaze towards Ithyl, and smiled.  “Getting yourself into trouble again Ithyl, or should I title you Simonic now?”  His voice sounded jestful.<p>
     “Not intentionally, my lord.” his voice came almost pleadingly and replied again “and I shall resume my normal title as Ithyl.”<p>
     The realms seemed to shake, as the six figures upon their stands vanished and appeared on the same level as Ithyl and Marr.  Their forms began to walk towards the two, cloaks billowing behind, with huge hammers held cross their chests, no features could be seen on them.  Whips of their cloaks flicked in some unseen wind as hard boots beat hard on the marble floor.  Mithaniel lifted his gaze up to the oncoming Tribunal and fixed himself in a perfect posture position.  Upright with one hand upon the hilt of his sword.  A god’s position.<p>
     “What important event then brings you to us, Marr?” again, all the figures seemed to speak at once, their voices echoing throughout the coliseum.<p>
     “Brell, has called a Gathering.”  Replied a stately voice, sounding more of a paladin.<p>
     “Brell?  What issue calls for a Gathering,” the figures had stopped about ten yards away but their voices rung loud and clear, “we have not had a gathering in almost a millennia, what calls for one now?”<p>
     A grin spread across the paladin god’s lips as he spoke again, “He called for it once Solusek Ro charged into his plane with a fiery blaze, whining and crying about power being sucked from right out his plane.  Turns out, that a guardian had been lying hidden since their destruction.  How he did so, we haven’t been able to figure it out, yet.”<p>
     “The Diz’Urian?” inquired the Tribunal <p>
     Marr looked at Ithyl and smiled, “So, you’ve told them already have you.” <p>
     Ithyl nodded his reply.  <p>
     “Well, with the rise of an active guardian to the realms, and an Urian at that, things need to be discussed,” the paladin god motioned over towards Ithyl, “and he is the reason why I have come.”<p>
     Ithyl raised his head and looked up into Marr’s eyes, the eyes that held a warmth that could not be explained, yet they seemed to pierce hard into one’s mind.  Suddenly, he felt as if the entire plane was staring at him, and perhaps they were as the world about him began to fade and shift.  Marr and the Tribunal remained still as the world fluxed sending the human’s mind into a downward spiral of confusion.  Slowly, the spinning, fading, and falling ceased and his mouth went agape.<p>
<centeR>**********************************************</center><p>

     Dorson’s legs beat hard, jumping over fallen debris and dodging falling bits of flame above head.  His breathing soon became ragged from inhaling far too much smoke that any human should have, but he was only a short distance away from Erudin.  As, a huge fiery being raged outside a pillared entrance.  Forms of people were everywhere.<p>
     As the distance closed, the hair upon his head rose off and on.  His face felt as if it were being pulled or sucked, he wasn’t sure.  Magic of every sorts was being charged into the huge beast.  Mages lined the mountain walls casting spells in unison, hoping a combined effect would help.  Others someone their own beasts of power to attack the fiery beast, nothing seemed to work.  Dorson had even seen paladins charging the beast, only to be burned into chunks of melted armor, leaving no flesh or bones.<p>
     Shouts and calls filled the air, mixed with the occasional scream, which was often soon silenced a moment later.  The area was unbearably hot, but no one could leave with such a creature sitting outside your back porch, so they remained casting elemental protections upon themselves, able to endure the heat longer.  Dorson did notice one man standing atop a group of rocks, it was Al’Kabor, shouting and pointing in different directions and at different men.<p>
     “Bring in the priests and set up here!” a moment later, “call in those who follow prexus, the heavens know how much we need him now!”, and then he casted his own spells, only to have them result in the same effect as all the other mages had, nothing.<p>
     Dorson ran next to a tree, hiding behind it and blocking some of the heat.  He stared in dreaded horror as it all took place.  Erudites fell and burned, nothing seemed to touch this beast, and it didn’t seem that anything would, soon.<p>
     “Unsure of what to do, Dorson?” a calm, smooth, feminine voice sounded behind him.<p>
     His mind thought for a moment, and he questioned why he always had unannounced visitors talking to him, always from behind.  But, knowing that this was to be another learning experience he shook his head.  A smooth sense washed over him, as if the thing behind him was smiling.<p>
     “Perhaps, this will help,” the voice, was absolutely beautiful and perfect.<p>
     The druid’s mind felt inexplicable pleasure as a soft warm hand touched the back of his neck, and with the touch came a burning flame into his mind.  His eyes hazed over, he was able to see the magic essence itself being woven and hurled.  Life about him seemed to be seen clearly, the fires appeared to be only that of magic, but their effect was like any other fire.  Yet, something was in his head, something powerful.<p>
     “Now, young one, cast that spell which has been given to you.” again calming.	<p>
     “Just cast it, or target it upon the beast?” questioned the druid to the thing behind him.<p>
     “Anywhere will do,” it simply replied.<p>
     At that, Dorson began to move his hands in a gesture of a spell, as he saw the strands of shining silver spun about his fingers, he realized he wasn’t casting a druidic spell, but a wizardly spell.  Shock to over him, but it didn’t stop his casting, only slow it.  As he wove the last gestures, needing no words, the entire area filled with an brilliant silverish haze, thicker than the thickest fog.  For a moment, all was silent, then they all screamed.  What had he just done?<p>
     As he had begun to worry about what he had just casted, and of the feminine thing behind him, he turned around slowly, awaiting a wicked looking beast behind him.  His mouth dropped, it was a gorgeous Erudite looking woman, she wore a simple gown, showing a little of her mid skin, and sleeveless arms, with a slit down her side legs.  All the things a young man would notice in a beautiful woman, and everything else was there as well.  Her skin looked to be softer than ivory, with the soft, cool, dark color that was often among most Erudites.  <p>
     As he stared at her, a smile came to her lips, her lush lips.  It was then he noticed a small crystal in the center of her forehead, and her hair didn’t touch her face in any section, it seemed to just always be in the wind floating gently behind her.  He thought it odd for a moment, but she had begun to speak to him.<p>
     “Do not be afraid of what you just did, in a moment, they’ll all know what you had just done,”  that voice, sent Dorson into a ocean of pleasure, which he swam in happily.<p>
     Snapping out of it, he nodded dumbly and turned back to look where the main fray took place, the silverish fog was beginning to clear up, and men had already stopped screaming again.  He noticed, there was no longer a fiery beast, and about the entire area there was no fire.  Nothing was aflame, though smoke still rose.  Magical swirls which had once been about the area, vanished.  Now, the voices about him cheered, but a few mentioned that they no longer had any protection spells on themselves.<p>
     “What did that spell do?” Dorson asked, as he continued to observe the area.<p>
     “It’s often called, Divine Dispelling, it removes many effects, even the effects forged by gods upon a large area.  One of my personal favorites, specially when playing games with them,” a young womanly giggle came from her mouth at the mention of the last games, a giggle that Dorson liked.<p>
     “Does it dispel the effects of guardians?” he inquired dumbly, as a smile faded from her face.<p>
     “No, it does not effect guardian’s or the effects wrought by them.  When they were created, they were granted more powers than the god’s should have given them.  They are almost untouchable by all, even the gods, except for one.”  She explained as a teacher explains to a student.<p>
     “Who is that exception?”<p>
     “Veeshan.”<p>

<b>Chapter Three</b><br><i>White Robes. The Gathering. Times.</i></center><p>
     A small ship pulled up to the docks within the Freeport Docks, as five men jumped off and helped guide the ship in by pulling large ropes and tying them off on pillars.  As they got the boat tied down, and steady, four men stood atop the gangplank.  They were covered in completely white robes and hoods, nothing of their faces could be seen, nothing of their hands, feet, or any part of their body could be seen.  Just their pristine white robes.  <p>
