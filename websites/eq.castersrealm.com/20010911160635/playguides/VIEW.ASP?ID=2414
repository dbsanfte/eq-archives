  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>This is not intended to be a beginner’s guide.  This is designed instead for those who already know their way around Norrath well and need only basic instruction as to the location of a Necromancer’s favorite prey as they advance through the levels.  Keep in mind that this was designed from the point of view of a gnomish necromancer, which makes faction considerations a bit different.  Also, this was written to take advantage of the new creatures of Kunark.<P>

Until you reach level 16 you are on your own.  These levels are more or less a blur, and should go by with relative ease for you.  Once you reach level 16, you have two options.  You can get to 17 off of the crocodiles and caimans in Oasis, or you can head to Lake Rathe.  Either way, 17 to 20, perhaps through to 21, you will spend in LR, as this is good experience and soloed fairly easily.  From 16 to 18 you can solo the hermit in the cove, known as Jonah Bruckner.  He is KoS to everyone, but beaten fairly easily.  You can find him by taking a right facing out from the South Karana entrance with the gnolls and undead, and hugging the walls until you find a little cove.  A map site will provide better directions.<P>

From 17 to 20, or to 21 if you feel like it, you can solo or tag-team on the aviak guards at various points in the Lake.  A great thing about these is they are dubious and have no faction change, so they will not attack you if you’re just running around.  However, kiting is more effective than fear, as their friends will often help, and they hit fairly hard.  Avoid letting them tear up your pet.<P>

Once level 20 comes, you now have the option to solo the hermit in South Karana.  It is not easy to find him and you should probably check the maps available before asking if he’s camped.  He hits rather hard and will KoS you, but you are safe if you sit right up against the wall.  If you cannot lure him out from the door, which is locked, slide up to the chimney real casually and say “I’m going to kill you.”  The only words required are “Kill You” so you could tell him “I’m going to kill you, Grandma.” And he’d still attack.  Make sure nothing is targeted when you try to get his attention so he will get on your targeting.  Fear him first off, he will run into the walls and get stuck there and your pet will pound away at him, while you cast all you want.  Just be sure to keep Fear going on him, or he may become very annoyed with you.  This is becoming a popular place to be and you may have to share, but you will likely be able to solo him without much trouble.  Just beware of wandering gnolls.<P>

Level 24 to 29 of a necromancer’s life tend to involve one thing, treants and lots of them.  You probably have not left the Karanas area for a while, and this is one of the longest stretches I spent bumming around one particular area.  The treants are virtually always camped, but if you get there early two or three necromancers, with the new Shock of Poison, can destroy the two-treant static spawn if they play their cards right.  Experience is amazing and loot is great too, usually in small coin and the occasional staff that fetches ten plat at the nearby centaur merchants.  Many times I was forced to seek a ride elsewhere to bank because I could barely move from the excess gold I had.  In one hardcore leveling spree I made three levels a day on this spawn, and I have heard of some necromancers getting even more than that with smaller groups.<P>

Many necromancers are unsure of what to do after the comfort zone of the Karanas gives way to lousy experience and boring hunting.  I was too, for a while, until I rediscovered the Sister island in the OOT.  The first stop off of Freeport, this provided me another great stretch of experience and loot from levels 29 to 33.  I took the hut on the hill, with the two sisters, one who has a sword that retails for ten platinum, which drops every time.  You must break this spawn, and the only way I found of doing this with any real degree of safety is to Screaming Terror one, usually the sword-wielder, and then feigning before her friend got to me.  I could then, usually, pick off the one sister and kite her around, then med up and return to finish off the one that was left behind.  If that was camped there are several other sisters to kill.  If you want to sell the swords you receive, and you are not initially KoS, you can do an easy quest in West Freeport with Pandos Flintside, a dwarf who resides in the Hog Caller’s Inn.  Give him muffins in exchange for faction.  Two bags full of muffins should take you up two or three faction settings.  I took mine up to Warmly because the prices for the swords were better then.  If a pirate blindsides you, and it will, you can use its earring to get faction also, from the leader of the Sisters.<P>

At level 34 I had two choices.  I could go and solo the tree spectre, near where the entrance to Fear is.  This is found easily by taking a right facing out from the Rathe Mountains zone entrance and going past the skeletons.  It is frequently camped in peak hours, though, and was a rather tough fight at 34, as it was almost always yellow or red to me, and resisted often.  I also had the option of fighting Cynthia, a faction-less wizard gypsy in Lake Rathe at the gypsy camp.  It is relatively safe to hunt her from right inside the camp, because the gypsies will not attack you, and most monsters never come close enough to you to attack.  If either one is camped, you can try the other alternative, or if you are very desperate, you can bum around and try to solo or group up on hill giants.  This should get you to level 39 easily enough, and with that comes another alternative, although specters remain good experience for a few more levels.<P>

At levels 39 to 43 a necromancer has two excellent sources of experience that are not overly likely to result in your death.  I went to the Overthere and soloed the great number of blue creatures that crossed my path, and since all the supplies, even a bank, are provided within the outpost in that zone, I never had to leave.  However, the constant rain is rather depressing and I got sick of it after a while.  The other alternative is dwarves in Butcherblock.  You’re likely already KoS to guards at any rate, so any civilian dwarf is fair game.  There are six at the docks, several singles at various huts in the area, two in the Butcherblock secondary newbie area, at a stone ring, and approximately four in two huts by the shore near the docks.  I checked all of these except the shore huts.  Screaming Terror may be used to break double spawns if necessary.  Your environment also plays a role in tactics here.  The docks require kiting, as fear makes them run to the guards, who will ruin you, but the single spawns may be fear kited if they do not run back to the guards.  Some testing may be needed to determine your best strategy.  I got tired of this place also, as there were constantly dwarven newbies begging me for the stuff I would leave on the corpses, as though I had a use for the bronze axes I got.  Newbies can be used to your advantage, for amusement or practical reasons, by making them heal you in exchange for the axes, or making them duel.  I did however have two instances of newbie harassment, and one where a newbie pulled the guards right onto me and put me in a very bad spot, so watch them so they don’t pull a fast one on you.<P>

At 44, your new spells grant you the freedom to solo the entire dock area of 6 dwarfs, with a little planning, until they no longer give you good experience at level 48.  I did this, and it is pretty fast paced keeping the dwarves in line, killing one every three minutes or so.  Or, you may opt to leave the annoyance of newbie begging behind and go, as I did eventually, to the most secluded place possible, Trakanon’s Teeth.  Get a port to the Dreadlands, run for your tiny little life to Karnor’s Castle and ask around until you can get a wizard or druid to evac you to the Emerald Jungle.  In both cases, head south, then take a left.  The Trakanon’s Teeth zone line is found easily enough.  You should, however, look for maps.  Bind near either zone line, it is your preference but I chose to bind on the little hill to the left, once inside the Trakanon’s Teeth zone.<P>

Once here you will be set to reach level 50 and beyond, and in the process you will have many opportunities to join up with people hunting for the items needed to get a key to Sebilis.  The key here is spectral keepers.  There are three camps of keepers near the EJ zone line, one to the right, and two to the left.  The nearby ones hold only about four each, but the farther one has six.  Keepers hit hard and their spells hit even harder, and they do not like leaving their homes.  Cast a powerful spell on it, then run away and hope you get far enough away to cast Darkness before it starts to rip you up.  Make the pet taunt it just in case it decides it likes the taste of gnome, or whatever race you happen to be.  Fear, fear, fear.  You must keep Keepers feared or they will nuke you dead before you can tap it back.  Additionally, there is a possibility that a harder spectral champion, or even harder commander will spawn in place of a keeper.  Champs are killable, as they are melee only, but be sure to keep them slowed and feared.  Do not try the commanders until you complete your arsenal of level 49 spells.  Once you reach level 49 you can get to 50 easily and quickly, and may be able to completely clear all three huts yourself, as I did, before they respawn again.<P>

At level 49, you can either continue to hunt Keepers, or return to your old haunt in the OOT… and then, run west across the water until you find the seafury cyclops island.  There are too many cyclopses on this island for fear to be effective, so you must equip your pet, buff him, and use the Pact of Shadow in conjunction with Bond of Death on the cyclops to keep your pet alive.  They have a lot of hit points but are only as strong as their weaker cousins in the Rathe Mountains, so use that to your advantage.<P>

So you’re level 50?  Congratulations.  Now, it’s time to make a decision.  Do I want to keep powerleveling and become the elite of the elite, a level 60?  Do I want to take it easy and farm some mid level dungeons?  Should I try to play in the high level Kunark dungeons with my friends?  The choices are up to you.  There are still creatures to be soloed past level 50, but you’ll have to find that out just like I did, and still am.<P>
