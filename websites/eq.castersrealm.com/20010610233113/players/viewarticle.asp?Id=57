<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	<p>The forest cracked and rustled with grunts, shouts, and heavy breathing. The trees stood almost motionless as they watched the young man and the elf perfect their maneuvers. They have been watching all morning, glad for the visitors that they had.
	<p>A leap through the air with sword held afront, followed by a trip and faulter bring Telsprital careening into the ground, sword skidding away along the grass.
	<p>"Damn-it!"
	<p>"Take it easy Spral," Zo'Kha laughed.
	<p>Spral grumbled to himself and hit the floor with his fists.
	<p>"It's okay, you'll learn it in time. Come on, get up. That's enough for today." Zo'Kha held out his hand and smiled. The Na'Dfal Elf was always smiling. Spral just looked down. "So Siri is going to help out, isn't she?" Again the laughter.
	<p>Spral chuckled, "Oh alright." He took Zo'Kha's hand and brought himself to his feet with Zo'Kha's help. "Thanks."
	<p>"There you go. This may be the last time you take my hand, you are almost a man and will need to help yourself up."
	<p>Spral heaved a great sigh. Ah, the pains of memory! Becoming a man, how that now hurts so much. The day he was to become a man was the day that changed his life.
	<p>Zo'Kha knew what had flashed through Spral's mind. "Accepting the past is a great part of becoming one's own. There are many things that I wish to not have remembered, but they contribute to what I am. To forget your past is to forget yourself."
	<p>"...But you've lived so long," Spral huffed.
	<p>"A memory is still a memory no matter the distance between. A memory of a hundred world seasons still seers like the wound of yesterday. All you can do is accept the pain. Will you keep tossing them down upon the earth? They will not go away if you do that. A memory is a seed that can sprout many types of emotions, if you choose it to grow. They can help you become stronger, they can mold you. Or they can be like weeds, ever growing and devouring." He looked Spral in the eyes, giving him a sympathetic look.
	<p>Spral looked down, all that Zo'Kha said was true. The pain will forever be fresh in his mind unless he came to look at his memories differently. He didn't want to remember, he didn't need the memories. He just wanted a future, the same as he always wanted. He wanted everything to be the same.
	<p>Zo'Kha put his hand on Spral's shoulder, "In time you will learn to accept it." There was no reaction from Spral. "I will leave you alone for now. I'll be back before the sun sets so you will have half of the afternoon to your thoughts. Turn to yourself before you turn to others. When everything is gone all you have left is you."
	<p>Still looking down, Spral sat down and nodded. "Thank you."
	<p>"For what?"
	<p>"Your patience."
	<p>"My pleasure. Now I will go and take some time to myself. I'll be back for you later."
	<p>Spral looked up at the light-tan elf, clad in simple brown cloth, and nodded.
	<p>Zo'Kha just smiled and walked out of sight among the trees.
	
	<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	<p>It had a been a good day. Spral was accepting his life more and more, and becoming better with the blade. Soon Zo'Kha wouldn't be able to teach him anymore, the young man would surely pass him up in weaponry skills. How grand. Telsprital made him very proud.
	<p>Zo'Kha gently walked through the flowers that danced in the afternoon breeze. He stopped and took in the view of the flowers around him. How elegant the purple and blue flowers looked among the dark green grass. It was not all too common to find flowers in the forest, let alone have such a large clearing in the middle of it.
	<p>He waded through the flowers and found some grass to sit upon. He smiled and took in the view of the clearing. Flowers off to one side and vine to the other. Behind and in front of him was more forest. It was just a clean, simplistic clearing in the forest. Nothing rare or out of the ordinary. Just plainly beautiful.
	<p>As he lay back and take in the surroundings he can only think of the boy. He has progressed so much. It was hard for the boy to deal with his changed life. He remembers well those first times with him. Zo'Kha closed his eyes as his memories zoomed in on the past.
	<p>When Zo'Kha had got to the mine entrance all was over. The mountain had been ripped into, lying in a sunken mass. Rocks and stones were everywhere, thrown about. Amongst the rubble was a young boy. He rushed to the boy. He was still alive! Zo'Kha quickly looked him over. Nothing seemed to be wrong with him. Unconcious and bruised a bit but very much alive.
	<p>He should take the boy back to his village, his kin would appreciate it. Zo'Kha could only wonder what had happened to the boy and what had done this here.
	<p>He took the young boy in his arms and slowly walked the path to the town. As he came to the last bend in the forest he noticed some smoke. Zo'Kha put the boy down and cautiously proceeded onward. As he approached the town all he could do was stand in shock. The town was destroyed. Several buildings we smoking, not from fire, they had been damaged with magic. His thoughts narrowed on who could have done this, a recent memory shook his mind.
	<p>But he had no time for this. Lives were at stake. He searched the through the remains of the buildings. He had found many bodies but no survivors. The buildings were in ruin, and blood filled every crevice. What a cruel deed.
	<p>What of the boy? Zo'Kha could not leave him here, nor could he use up any more time. He did not wish the boy to see what fate had befallen his town. He would take him with him, he had to.
	<p>He returned to the still unconcious boy and once again took him into his arms. He would return to bury the dead. It was the least he could do. Of course that would have to wait until the boy was safe and away from this place.
	<p>As he walked he thought of places to take the boy. He wanted to take him to the woods, but that would be too close. He would not go to open fields. The mountains would be too harsh, or would they? He knew of a small cave not far from here. It was far enough away that the boy would not be able to how to leave and return to town. Yes, he would take him to the cave. It would provide shelter and protection.
	<p>He picked up his speed and arrived at the cave just before dusk. He laid the boy upon the floor while he went out and gathered branches and twigs for a fire. He also returned with leaves and fruits for the boy. The leaves would make his bed and the fruit would return precious strength to his body.
	<p>Zo'Kha stayed awake all night. The boy never woke up that night.
	<p>The next day Zo'Kha went out to collect more food. When he returned the boy was sitting atop the leaves eating the fruit he had left.
	<p>The boy looked at him for a moment and continued eating. After a few more bites the boy put down what remained of his fruit and gave the elf his attention. Zo'Kha's presence was making the boy uneasy.
	<p>"Hello young sir, how are you feeling this fine morning?"
	<p>"..."
	<p>"Let me introduce myself," putting down the food and standing tall, "I am Zo'Kha. A wanderer, defender of the forest."
	<p>"...I like the forest..." said the boy timidly, obviously not knowing what to say.
	<p>"I thought I saw someting special in you." Zo'Kha smiled. "You must be very hungry to eat all of that."
	<p>"Yes I was very hungry." was all he could say.
	<p>His smile faded, "I found you unconcious and bruised yesterday afternoon." "What happened?"
	<p>The boy's head seemed to spin at this. "I don't know."
	<p>"You don't remember?" Zo'Kha asked.
	<p>"I do, I just don't know why," his voice trailed off. He began to fumble with the leaves on his bed. Zo'Kha waited patiently. After a few minutes the boy spoke. "I was going to help the men in the mines, they told me to stand guard so I did. Then there was a troll!" he paused, "No, there was a cave in and then a troll. And then,"
	<p>"A troll?"
	<p>"Uh huh."
	<p>"Alright, please continue."
	<p>"Well he was gonna hurt me, but then a giant came and cut him in half. He just came out of nowhere."
	<p>"A giant?! Do you remember what he looked like?"
	<p>The boy was startled by the elf's sudden mood change, "...No sir I don't, I saw him for a moment. That is all I remember." The boy sulked back.
	<p>Zo'Kha realized he must be scaring the boy, "I'm sorry, I just wanted to know. I'm okay, and so are you."
	<p>The boy nodded.
	<p>"Enough of that for now. Now to more important matters, what is your name?"
	<p>"Telsprital Lennar. They call me Spral."
	<p>"Spral is it?" Zo'Kha bowed, "A pleasure to meet you Spral."
	<p>Spral smiled, "And you sir."
	<p>"Please, just Zo'Kha is fine. That is all I've ever been called," he smiled.
	<p>"Okay Zo'Kha!" his eyes and voice trailed off, " ...Uh, Zo'Kha?"
	<p>"Yes?"
	<p>"Where am I?"
	<p>Zo'Kha tried to think of what to tell the boy, he knew what he would ask next. He had to tell him, it was his duty. "You are in a cave, in the deeper regions of the Na'Dfal mountains." The boy noticeed Zo'Kha seemed distraught at the mention of the name Na'Dfal.
	<p>"Oh," is all the boy said.
	<p>Zo'Kha brushed aside his own pain and prepared to tell the boy. "I know what you will be asking next."
	<p>"..."
	<p>"The answer is no."
	<p>Spral gave him a curious look.
	<p>"I assumed you would be asking if you may return to your home."
	<p>Terror struck the young boys face, "I can't go back?! W-Why?! What are you going to do?" the boy staggered, fearing the elf.
	<p>"No it is not by my will," Zo'Kha replied in response to Spral's question. "Your town no longer stands proud. I am sorry."
	<p>Spral looked at him with teared eyes, "What...?"
	<p>Zo'Kha knew how the boy felt, his own home had been destroyed. Spral had it easier than he did though. Zo'Kha was the only one of his kind left, the last of the Na'Dfal elves. He wouldn't let this boy feel as if he was the last one of his kind.
	<p>Zo'Kha kindly replied, "It has been destroyed. We cannot return. I have searched the town for survivors, and there was no one. I'm sorry." Zo'Kha sat down on the floor in front of Spral.
	<p>Spral replied by looking down, "I understand. But are you sure there are no survivors?"
	<p>Zo'Kha sighed, "I'm sure. I was planning to go back to give them all a proper burial, you may come with me if you'd like."
	<p>Spral looked confused, "No. I won't go. I can't, I just can't."
	<p>"I understand your pain, at least you know they will be taken care of."
	<p>"What will happen to me then? What can I do? Where do I go?"
	<p>"You will come with me, it is about time that I had a friend to bring upon my journeys. You will be quite an addition young one. We can help each other out. What do you say?"
	<p>Spral pushed away his tears, "I like that idea. I'll go with you, friend. Thank you."
	<p>"For what?"
	<p>"Your kindness."
	<p>Zo'Kha smiled, "Well, before it gets too hot out I should gather some fruits and wood, I'll be right back friend. I'll gather it for the evening."
	<p>"Don't forget those berries, they were great."
	<p>Zo'Kha managed a chuckle, "I'll see if I can find more for you."
	<p>He came back with more berries, and wood. They spoke much that night, slowly getting to know each other. When Spral fell asleep, Zo'Kha went back to the town that was Denargus and buried each body, as he had said he would.
	<p>After that first day Spral spoke freely, he never mentioned his family though except that he loved them so, and even spoke of what happened to him at the mines. One little detail always bothered Zo'Kha though, Spral spoke of a troll that was felled by the giant, but when he had found Spral there were no bodies around. Always a strange thought to him.
	<p>As the days passed Zo'Kha tried to not push the boy with memories much, he could very well see that Spral was holding everything inside, trying to be strong. Spral might have a hard life, he might not. It all depended on how he matured, and how he would be nurtured. Zo'Kha would surely try his best.
	<p>Zo'Kha sat up, stretching. The sun was beginning to pass behind the trees. Much time had passed while he was laying there, he would be returning to Spral soon.
	
	<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	<p>He could see the elf plainly through the tree branches. He was standing in place, poised for a strike. Not this time he thought  to himself.
	<p>This time he knew what he was doing, he was playing the elf for the fool.
	<p>He tugged the vine again, having the branch tied to the end of it as a rock. He would usually throw rocks in different directions, but it never worked. One time he threw two rocks in different directions at the same time. He almost had him, but not quite. This time he would.
	<p>The elf manuevered himself so that he was facing the noise at an angle. How Spral wanted to pounce, but now was not the time.
	<p>He tugged ferociously on the vine a last time, and then quietly jumped off the branch and into the clearing.
	<p>Zo'Kha turned his head just as Spral fell upon him, a smile wide across his face.
	<p>Zo'Kha was knocked to the ground while Spral dropped into a roll and then used his remaining momentum to spin upon his fallen opponent. He planned to be upon the elf before he would be able to get up, to dispatch of him without drawing blades. Not today.
	<p>Zo'Kha turned onto his belly and catapaulted himself to his feet, but not before Spral was upon him.
	<p>Spral ran his shoulder into Zo'Kha's right arm and spun around to his back, sword at his throat.
	<p>"Give up ancient one?"
	<p>"I see you've been thinking."
	<p>Spral tightened his grip around Zo'Kha's arm and chest, "Give up ancient one?"
	<p>Zo'Kha laughed, "I give."
	<p>Spral let him go and put his sword away, "I finally got you."
	<p>"So you did," he said as he turned around to face the young man. "And as you said, finally!"
	<p>Spral smiled, "Yeah, it was a good plan. I tied a branch to a vine and then hid in the trees. It was great."
	<p>"Really? Hmm, perhaps next time you can accomplish the feat without a diversion. You will be a true tracker then."
	<p>"Ah, I tracked you."
	<p>"I know you did Spral, I'm just trying to help you out. I need to teach you as much as I can before you become too stubborn."
	<p>Spral gave the elf a mischievous look, a look that Zo'Kha only replied to with a shrug. Spral sighed, there was nothing else.
	<p>"So, shall we camp here then? You seem to know the area, so why don't you prepare for nightfall?"
	<p>"Seems like I always seem to know the area, you're the old one, haven't you been here before?"
	<p>"I only do it to teach you, and no. I don't know this area. Now get to work, you need the practice."
	<p>Spral put his hand up to his head, "Damn, I forgot the packs."
	<p>Zo'Kha threw him a condescending look, "Then you must retrieve them. Go, before the birds carry them away."
	<p>"Yeah right, the birds," Spral chuckled. "I'll be back." He laughed as he ran out of the clearing.
	<p>"You would be very surprised!" Zo'Kha joked back at Spral's fading image.

	<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	<p>This is what is was like through the years. Zo'Kha would train Spral in the way of blades and teach him how to be a ranger.
	<p>During the first year of being with Zo'Kha, Spral realized he could use these newfound skills in a sort of game against the elf. He would track him down, and try to ambush him. He never succeeded. He never really thought he would. The elf just had too much experience, he's lived a very long time.
	<p>Spral never knew how long the elf had lived, he never spoke of his past much. He did know that he had been in a great war that altered the planet, but nothing more than that. Whenever he probed the elf he appeared sullen and only replied with, "In time." Whatever that meant.
	<p>So they continued traveling, sometimes stopping in towns. They usually made their money, if they had any, by putting on a show in town. They would perform; archery, sword-fighting, wrestling, among a few other things. Spral had never seen Zo'Kha defeated, which was a good thing. He felt safe with the elf, although he was somewhat withdrawn.
	<p>If they were not in town then they camped outside under the stars, in a clearing, such as on the night Spral finally ambushed Zo'Kha.
	<p>It was usually like this, Spral would set up camp and Zo'Kha would just sit there, watching and waiting for him to finish. Spral never really minded all that, he just wondered how setting up camp would help train him. In the morning Spral would pack up, and they would be on their way. Wandering the world. Always staying in or close to forests while they traveled.
	<p>As a few months of wandering passed, Zo'Kha felt the urge to travel back to Spral's home. Very near to the once magnificant forest of Na'Dfal.
	<p>At first Zo'Kha did not know he was returning, but soon he knew what the strange feeling in his heart meant. It was time to return to the place he found Spral, to the memories of the fated day.

	<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------


	<p>As Spral looked around, he could only wonder. This was strange of Zo'Kha. He had to ask. "Zo'Kha, why are on the road?"
	<p>"Because it is a nice day."
	<p>"Really now, we usually travel through the woods. If we ever needed to follow the road we would do it from the cover of the trees. So, why are we on the road?"
	<p>"Because it's a nice day to walk on the roads."
	<p>Spral sighed in frustration. Zo'Kha had been acting strange the past few weeks. He couldn't understand. He was being so peculiar, never giving him a real answer as of late.
	<p>"Fine, since we are on the roads, where are we going? Don't say you don't know either, because I know you do."
	<p>"You will see."
	<p>Spral was getting rather annoyed. They had been on this road for two days now and Zo'Kha wouldn't tell him where they were going. It felt very odd for Spral, where was Zo'Kha taking him? He knew there was a town somewhere near here. They saw wagons all the time. Going down the road and up the road. A place of trade perhaps? Maybe a farming village that had an abundance of crops? It did not make a difference, he just wanted to know why were they going there, that's all.
	<p>As they were to round a curve, Zo'Kha stopped.
	<p>"This is not your past."
	<p>"What? What are you talking about?" Spral replied with confusion.
	<p>"Lets keep going."
	<p>What is this elf talking about? he thought. Perhaps he lost his mind somewhere?
	<p>As they proceeded Spral began to slowly recognize his surroundings. The mountains, the road. He began to twist and look around franticly. This was his home! Without thinking or saying anything he dashed along the road and made the final turn to the town.
	<p>He stopped just as he made the turn. The town was huge, it had grown so much without him. He was suddenly filled with anger at Zo'Kha. How could he take him away from his family, from his friends. He lied to him. I'll deal with the elf later he thought as he found himself running again. Running to his house.
	<p>He was scared and confused as he came to where his house should be. Instead of his house there was a shop.
	<p>He turned to the first person to pass him by, an older man, "Excuse me, what town is this?"
	<p>"Denargus," the man replied and walked off.
	<p>Spral stood there looking all around him. He saw men, women, children, and none of them looked familiar. As he looked at the shop he realized it wasn't even the same structure as his house.
	<p>"I told you, this is not your past."
	<p>That voice...
	<p>"Spral... Spral."
	<p>Suddenly he returned to reality and recognized the voice, it was Zo'Kha.
	<p>He looked at the elf and dashed out of town, crying all the way.

	<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	<p>As they sat on the log, Zo'Kha wondered if he had done the right thing. Spral still hasn't spoken, and it was almost night fall. He tried to speak with him, but he wouldn't reply in any way. No facial expressions, no shrugs, nothing.
	<p>Zo'Kha rose from the log and thought to himself, someone must set camp. As he started to unpack the bags Spral stood up. Zo'Kha turned around and looked at him.
	<p>"I'll do that." he said and walked towards Zo'Kha.
	<p>As he stepped aside he softly spoke, "I'm sorry."
	<p>"Thank you," he said, hugged the elf, and cried.
	<p>Zo'Kha smiled, he was ready to become a ranger. Soon he would advance his training.
	<p>"I think, everything will be okay," Spral said as he pulled away.
	<p>"Indeed it shall, now... set up camp," he replied with a smile.
	<p>Spral laughed, "Of course, you forgot how. Why do you think I always volunteer to do it?"
	<p>"Nonsense. Move out of the way. Give me that!"
	<p>Spral dropped the bags and leaned against the log. After a moment, "You're doing it wrong."
	<p>"I am not."
	<p>"I told you that you forgot old timer!"
	<p>"We'll see how much of an old timer I am tomorrow," he threatened Spral. "It will be a pity too, getting beaten by someone so old!"
	<p>Spral just laughed and let Zo'Kha finish setting up camp.
	<p>They talked much that night, speaking of many things. Most of all Spral talked of his childhood, and of his family. Zo'Kha mostly listened and encouraged him, with a comment or question of his own evey now and then.
	<p>As they lay there in the moonlight, Zo'Kha thought of how great it was for Spral to finally get it out and accept it. Soon they he would be able to take him and go searching for what really happened those many seasons ago. This was the first stop, the place where it all began. But that would be left until tomorrow, was the last thought on his mind before he fell asleep.
	<p>Spral, on the other hand was awake and thinking of much more things than Zo'Kha was.
	<p>Why did the elf bring him here? It was somewhat comforting to know that all Zo'Kha told him about his town was truth, but it still bothered him. How had the destruction of his town come about anyway? How was it that Zo'Kha was there to find him? Why wouldn't the elf speak of his own past? It was all very strange to him.
	<p>As he thought of memories of long ago he could not help but remember the day that changed everything. Would everything have turned out different if he had not gone to the mines? Would he even be alive?
	<p>It all seemed like such a dream to him, the dark elf, the giant, the seraph... did they even exist? Was it all in his head, a made up fantasy covering the truth of his town? Or did it really happen? If it did, what did it all mean? Why did it happen? He had to know.
	<p>He sat up and looked at Zo'Kha, asleep. Good. He quietly put his boots on and grabbed his sword. As he began to leave he decided against taking his sword. He put it down and took Zo'Kha's instead. Something inside him told him to. There was something special about the elf's.
	<p>He looked back on Zo'Kha making sure he was still asleep, and then quietly stepped away from the camp.
	<p>He walked out of the forest and onto the road. He could see the town from here. He turned away hurt, and refocused himself to the task at hand. All he had to do was follow the road a bit and then he could enter his woods. From there he knew the way to the mines.
	<p>After a walking a little ways he found the tree. As he looked at the tree he remembered all the times it had granted him entry to the woods he called his second home. He smiled as he thought to himself, I'm back!
	<p>He entered the woods slowly and carefully. He had never been through here at night, and something from his childhood fears still held on to him when going through the woods.
	<p>As he walked through the trees his memories came back to him. He began to remember the way, and slowly picked up his pace as he went along.
	<p>It lookes so different at night, the boughs, the roots... all looked tainted, menacing. None of the forest he had been in looked that way at night. Just this one. It was most certainly his imagination.
	<p>When he was almost upon the mines he began to slow down, edging towards the clearing. He was almost afraid. Afraid of what he might find, or what might happen.
	<p>When he finally stepped out of the woods and onto the clearing,  nothing happened.
He was relieved and most of the fear left him.
	<p>He stepped slowly, as his eyes adjusted to the newly found abundance of moonlight. As he looked he saw that most of the rubble had been cleared away, and it seemed as though an attempt to get into the mines had been given up. The entrance was somewhat cleared of the large rocks and boulders, but there were even larger ones in the back of the tunnel.
	<p>There was grass growing on the floor in front of the opening, suggesting that nothing had been done to clear the way in quite some time.
	<p>He took his time and looked around, except for the clearing of the rubble, everything was as he remembered. He tried to pinpoint his location when the giant came. It was somewhere past the initial path of debri.
	<p>He stood there, and looked to his left. There was a small raised cliff, just above the crotch of where the mountains met. That is where the giant jumped from. He was sure of it. At this point he take any kind of truth, any information brought him closer to what happened.
	<p>He remembered staring at the two halves of the troll, the part with most of the upper torso was still twitching after it was severed. The troll... Zo'Kha said there was no troll when he found him. That did not fit in either, who would take the body of a dead troll?
	<p>He shook his head in disgust and walked over to where he had stopped when he saw the dark elf. The beginning of the mountain slope, directly to the right of the mine entrance. She was sliding and jumping down the side of the mountain, that memory amazed him. She accomplished that almost effortlessly, a feat which would have almost certainly have killed him.
	<p>She was beautiful, jumping, almost dancing, down the mountain. Whenever he heard stories of the evil elves he imagined them as ugly, orc-like versions of their grand cousins. But this was not the case. If there was anything he learned from Zo'Kha it was that things were not always as they appeared to be.
	<p>He sat down, slightly disappointed. He had come here hoping for answers, but instead just reassured himself that his memories were real. At least he knew they were real.
	<p>Sitting there quietly, in the midst of memories, he quickly dozed off.

	<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	<p>Still shaking the sleepiness out of his eyes Spral heard the noise again. He yawned, not knowing if he was awake or not. Once more he heard the noise, it was rocks.
	<p>He rose to his feet and looked about him, his eyes readjusting. It was still dark out with no sign of dawn.
	<p>"How is one with so much power so lazy?"
	<p>That was not Zo'Kha, "Who is this?" he replied as he scanned his viewable range. He found who he was looking for at a pile of rocks, kicking them about. That was the noise.
	<p>"That was the same question I was to ask of you. I can sense the energy within you, where did you get it from? Who are you?"
	<p>Drawing the sword, "I am but a wanderer, returning to a place of interest to myself. I have no dealings with you. You do not need my name."
	<p>"A magical blade. Hmmppf. I will not ask you again, where did you acquire your energies, they are not... normal. It was bestowed upon you, from where?!" yelled the cloaked figure.
	<p>Magical blade? What... Zo'Kha's sword! It's magical?! What a time to be holding out on me, and what energy is this one speaking of? "I do not know what you speak of when you say energies, I have no magic about me."
	<p>"Have it your way, one way or another I will find out. I will take care of your mockery."
	<p>"I really have no idea of what you are talking about!" he cried.
	<p>"Enough!" with that the cloaked figure dashed at him, fast!
	<p>Spral gritted his teeth and prepared to fight. He was backed up against the mountain with no where to go. If he ran up the slope it would be to his disadvantage. He bounded forward and away from the corner.
	<p>The stranger stopped and withdrew his sword, a very finely crafted long sword. It was slightly longer than Zo'Kha's sword, giving him the edge in the fight. Spral didn't care, just as long a he survived.
	<p>"This will be quite fun, are you ready?"
	<p>"Does it matter?" Spral snapped back.
	<p>Spral came in swinging hard with an overhead arch. His blow was easily deflected. The stranger came across with his blade and Spral met him, but then the stranger brought his force up and then down, breaking free of Spral's blade and slicing the under side of his forearm.
	<p>Spral gasped in pain and grabbed the injury with his left had while backing up.
	<p>"How inexperienced you are, I do not see how you acquired the elven blade," he laughed, "It seems as though you spoke the truth, not that it matters. I'll do you a favor and teach you how to fight though, quite a lesson for you!"
	<p>The cloaked figure dropped his sword and came in with a punch to Spral's stomach. He leaned over and was struck in the face with an elbow. As he staggered back he was kicked behind his kneecap and brought down to one knee.
	<p>"There is your first lesson in fighting boy. I hope you learned something."
	<p>Boy? Boy!? Who was he calling boy?! With renewed vigor Spral brought up his hand as though to strike him and the stranger caught his arm, he knew he would. He swung his arm up, still holding the sword, and slashed across the strangers face. Blood dripped from his cloaked face and he let out a grunt.
	<p>"So you still wish to fight? As you wish," he said and stepped back to gather up his sword.
	<p>As Spral stood up his opponent charged in. Spral managed to block a consecutive number of blows and it seemed apparent the stranger was becoming angry. He backed off for a moment and then came in quickly from the right and just as quickly back from the left, knocking the sword down to the ground. Bringing the sword back up into the air the stranger hit Spral just above his left temple with the hilt of the sword, opening a wound. Dazed, Spral just stood there, and left himself open for further attacks. Instead of dispatching of Spral he just brought the bottom of the hilt down upon Spral's head very forcefully.
	<p>Spral let go of the sword and began to careen forward but was abruptly stopped by a powerful strike to his jaw.
	<p>"Let that be a lesson to you, if you can even hear me. You are strong with mana, perhaps some day you shall be somewhat of a challenge to me. Until then," he brought the tip of his sword to the collapsed Spral's forehead, "Stay alive," and kicked Spral in the ribs.

	<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	<p>Zo'Kha knew where the boy had gone, why he had taken his sword he did not know. It did not really matter, he must find him. He had a terrible feeling something had happened to him.
	<p>As Zo'Kha broke free of the trees his thoughts were shown to be true. Laying upon the ground was a bloody and bruised Spral. As he ran up to him, he realized he was unconcious. He did not know how badly he had been hurt, but there was a small pool of blood forming around him.
	<p>As he began to cradle him and look for his wounds a voice echoed across the clearing.
	<p>"Treat him well, he carries with him the strength of mana."
	<p>Zo'Kha's elven eyes scanned the clearing, but there was no one there.
	<p>He returned his gaze to the young man, spoke some muffled words and passed his hand over his head. Spral gasped and took in a deep breath, but that was just the spell taking affect.
	<p>"Your first lesson in spells my friend, you will heal just fine."
	<p>He looked back across his shoulder and proceeded to scoop up the still unconcious body of Spral and then his sword.
	<p>"I'll have to teach you how to use this also," he said.
	<p>Zo'Kha took Spral back to camp and as he watched over him could only wonder as to why this happened. He knew that whoever spoke to him did this to Spral, but why? He suspected it had something to do with that day many years ago when he found Spral. But he would have to wait for his answers.
	<p>He knew it was time to teach Spral the ways of nature, of the druid. He also knew it was time to reveal his past to him. All at once, as one. Zo'Kha would make sure Spral would be strong before he had to go. Before his own fate took him away.
