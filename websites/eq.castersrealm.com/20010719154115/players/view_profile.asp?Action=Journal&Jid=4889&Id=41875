  <tr><td class='db'><p>Well.  I never knew that the messengers and couriers we take for granted really lead a tough life.</p>

<p>After spending a couple of days in Kelethin, I thought I would go ahead and deliver a message I had received from Idia that was bound for Freeport.  I had never been on a boat before, and in all honesty, we dwarves don't make good seafarers (can't fathom why anyone would want to leave good, dry land), so the trip was one I was dreading.  But I had given my word, and was determined to deliver the message.  Mimaven was no where to be found, but I had made some friends during my stay in the town.  One elf I had met, an elven cleric named Attriarck, was more than willing to make the journey and had in fact been to many places as a child; thus he seemed to know the way.  It was good to have a guide of some kind, and the idea soothed me.  Attriarck lived some distance from Kelethin; the city of Felwithe was his home.  I had told him on our last meeting that would travel from Kelethin to Felwithe and pick him up, and then we would travel together to Freeport.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Felwithe, Attriarck was already outside waiting for me.  We greeted, and I looked over his equipment.  He was not well equipped, since like myself he was just beginning his adventures.  Luckily, I had some equipment on me that he could use.  I gave him my buckler and some shoulderpads I wasn't using, since Gorgleon had given me some equipment earlier in the week.  He also needed food for such a long trip, so we went into Felwithe itself to pick up some milk and rations for him.  I gave him some coins to purchase his food, and then retreated to the pub to enjoy some spirits.  Soon Attriarck joined me and we made our way to the gate.  Before heading out, I asked him if he would like to carry a message as well, since the elven woman had mentioned to me that she always had something that needed to be delivered.  Attriarck pondered it for a moment, then decided that he could use the small extra cash from the delivery.  Since she was back in Kelethin, we made our way back there.</p>

<p>When we arrived back in the treetop town, we immediately met with another elven friend of mine, Kaylx.  She was actually a close friend of Mimaven's, and during my stay I had talked with her a few times.  After a brief conversation, we told her of our plans, and she eagerly asked if she could join us.  We could always use some extra help, so we agreed to have her along.  Since the whole journey was to be a courier run, we took her with us to the Bard's Guild (which worked out well for her, since she was a bard herself).  After picking up our mail, we got ready to leave on our trip.  However, Attriarck was summoned away by other members of his Guild.  He promised to meet back up with us when we returned from Freeport.  With that, he took his leave; so much for a guide.</p>

<p>Kaylx and I left Kelethin eagerly.  It must have been the first time Kaylx had ever been out of the city, because she kept wandering off and I was often forced to search for her in the forest (elves can be so flighty sometimes).  I imagine the various denizens of the woods, and the colorful magical mists from a mage casting his spell would be wondrous to a young adventurer.  Soon, though, we were able to cross the mountain pass into Butcherblock.  Kaylx stayed a bit closer to me here; my guess is because the land and creatures were new to her.  Anyway, we made our way to Kaladim (admittedly, I took a wrong turn and got us lost for a brief time... I must be having too many Short Beers!), and I took her within the walls so that she might pick up yet another piece of mail (these Bards... they sure have a lot to say to each other!).  We left immediately and headed for the docks to meet the boat bound for Freeport.  As soon as we entered the city walls, a creature that I can only guess was an Aqua Goblin greeted me!  It attacked me on sight, and I was forced to defend myself.  The monster was clearly more than my equal, even though a cleric who was unknown to me was giving my strength and healing my wounds.  I was lucky in this one, though, and the local guard heard the fight, and came to vanquish the monster.</p>

<p>I was tired from the short scuffle, but I didn't want to miss the boat (so to speak).  After making sure Kaylx was okay, we headed for the pier.  There we met another pair of wily adventurers who seemed to be trying to unnerve us with tales of Sea Monsters and pirates on the high seas, but I was able to direct my attention away from their banter with some fishing from the pier.  I must have caught four fish before the boat finally came... I think this might be a good way to get myself a constant supply of fresh food.</p>

<p>We boarded, and soon the boat left port.  Within hours we came upon a group of islands with some strange looking women sitting atop rocks jutting from the sea.  I can only guess that these must have been Sirens, but I have never seen one before.  Heeding the warnings I have heard as a child, I turned my attention away from them and once again took to my fishing.</p>

<p>Now, earlier I mentioned that I was grateful for a guide... and this trip was a perfect example of why.  See, the first stop after Butcherblock is a set of islands off shore, not the human town of Freeport.  Since I had never been on a boat before, I assumed that this was our stop, and we got off the boat.  I quickly realized my error, but not before the boat had already left.  Upon speaking to the locals, I found that another boat would not be by for at least a day.  I was also informed that the local forests were not the safest place to travel, so I was stuck in town with nothing to do but fish.  So I spent the rest of the evening and into the night just fishing.  Kaylx, bless her, simply sat next to me the entire night, her eyes scanning the horizon for the boat to Freeport.  It would not be until early morning that we would see the boat once again.  And THIS time, we did not get off until we were CERTAIN of our location.</p>

<p>Finally we were in East Freeport.  I guess this name alone should have been a clue to me... if there's an East Freeport, there was probably a West as well (and a North I came to find out).  But I spent much of the afternoon searching the Inn and the Dockmaster's for the intended recipient of my message.  After thoroughly frustrating myself, I finally found the passage to West Freeport, and ultimately, North Freeport.  I spent a good day and a half search this city.  Humph.  Human architecture.  Anyway, I finally found the Bard's Guild, and located Felisia, and offered her the message.  She looked at it quizzically and thanked me, but I could tell that she was unsure of what to do with it.  I asked her if she knew anything about it, and she said no, but took it anyway and offered to figure out whom it belonged to.  In the meantime, she said that another package needed to go back to Kelethin, and to see a bard by the name of Twostrings to get it.  I felt a bit irritated, because it was becoming clear to me that this trip was going to offer me no profit at all.  However, I made the best of it that I could, and took the letter bound for Kelethin.  Besides, I had to take Kaylx home, as she was becoming restless and visibly tired of our journey.  Can't say I blame her.  We took our letters, and headed back to the East Freeport docks.</p>

<p>Luckily, we didn't have too long to wait.  The boat came almost immediately, and we were very grateful to head back to Faydwer.  However, misfortune struck again, and Kaylx slipped off the dock and into the Sea.  At first I didn't notice, but I heard her splashing around and when I went to investigate, I saw her in the water.  I jumped in after her, and swam to her.  Neither of us are very good swimmers; she is from the treetops, and I have lived my life in the deep earth... if not for the underground streams running through Kaladim, I would have sunk like a stone.  It took some time and effort to help her get to the shore; unfortunately I think she was in a panic, and would not heed my instructions to get onto dry land.  It took some doing, but we made it.  Anyway, the boat didn't wait for us, and we were forced to sit wet and cold on the dock and wait for the next one.  To her credit, Kaylx did little complaining at this point... I imagine she was just over her "adventure" by now.</p>

<p>After the ship finally came and we were able to get on board safely, the rest of the journey was largely uneventful.  We were certainly glad to be back in Feydwer, and although tired, we began our walk to Kelethin right away.  The walk was a long one, perhaps exaggerated by our fatigue.  Once again, though, Brell smiled on us and we made it to the elven city with no troubles.  Kaylx was visibly relieved once the city was in view, and her pace quickened as we grew nearer.  We took the lift to the city gates, and made our way to the Bard's guild, and turned over the messages we had for those within (I accidentally gave one of the elves the wrong package... I gave her my own backpack!!  She looked pretty happy with what was inside (fresh fish and such), so I did not have the heart to ask for it back).  Kaylx turned and said that she was off to rest a visit her family, and said that she would meet with me another time.  We said our fare-thee-wells, and off she went.</p>

<p>At this point I had pondered on what to do.  My mail was delivered, my companion was gone, and I was pretty tired and hungry.  I was planning to go home, when a familiar voice called my name.  I turned to see Attriarck standing behind me!  After some greetings, Attriarck indicated that he wanted to go forth and vanquish more minions of evil.  Always ready to carry on the good fight, I quickly agreed, and out we went.  Apparently there mere many others who also were out to quell evil, as the forest literally teemed with all manner of adventurers, making our own crusade a bit difficult and even pointless.  After a few hours slaying bats and an occasional skeleton, I suggested to Attriarck that we instead try our luck in the plains of Butcherblock.  Attriarck seemed to like the idea, and out we went.</p>

<p>From here, my luck turned sour.  I can only guess that Brell was working to teach me in some greater way, as I became no more effective than a babe wielding a spoon.  First, right as we reached the pass into Butcherblock, we were attacked by a pair of large spiders.  Now, them in and of themselves are no so much a problem, but before I was able to vanquish them, we were assaulted from behind by and Orc Centurion!  At first I did not notice, and it was not until Attriarck was near the last of his strength that I saw him.  And to make matters worse, I found myself poisoned!  My strength was draining, my cleric was defeated, and two enemies now took turns whittling me down into blackness (I was able to defeat one of the spiders, but was forced to turn my attention to the Orc thereafter).  When I awoke, I found myself near Kaladim, quite some distance from my equipment.  Without hesitating, I left to recover my items.  When I arrived at the scene of the battle, I found Attriarck already there waiting for me.  We shared a laugh and commented on our good fortune that we were still around to gather our things.  Soon after we crossed into Butcherblock... but I found that my luck was no better in my home region.  In fact, I was defeated THREE times that day.  Once by the orc and spiders, once by a giant bat, and a third time by a pair of wandering ogres.  From what I hear, these two are a murderous pair who hunts down those crossing from Butcherblock into Greater Faydark.  After their cowardly rear attack on me, I resolved to begin my own crusade to send them to their dark lord.  However, I will need some more experience under my belt and some more companions to complete my goal... that will come later.</p>

<p>After the last defeat, I told Attriarck that it might be best if he just headed back to Kelethin.  After all, I was still pretty exhausted from my travels to Freeport, which was probably lending to my inability to fight effectively.  We bid each other farewell, and Attriarck left for home.  I hear he met back up with Mimaven, and did some adventuring.  That's good!  Perhaps soon the three of us can go out and do battle in the name of Good.</p>

<p>For now, I will simply finish my Beer, blow out my faithful lantern, and let restful sleep overcome me.</p>
