<p>Mage of the 12th Circle</p>
<p>Dark Elven</p></center>


	<p>Emyrald walked out of the Hall of the Spurned, having finished practicing, learning, and component shopping. She was immediately spit upon by the nearest guard.</p>
	<p>“Get out of here, Spurned. I hate you as I hate the High Elves,” he said.</p>
	<p>If he’d known her true story, though, he would have killed her on the spot, as he would a High Elven. For that is what Emyrald really was.</p>
	<p>The tale began approximately 16 years back, when she was but a fledgling two year old. But not a fledgling two year old Dark Elven. She’d been of the esteemed High Elves then.</p>
	<p>That day had started out peacefully. Her father, Numeras, was out on a hunt, and her mother was in the house over the stove. She was baking something or another, Emyrald could not remember what, and it didn’t bear any significance anyways. As her mother was flipping whatever was in the pan, the walls of the house shook. The great city of Felwithe of being attacked.</p>
	<p>Her treacherous father led the Dark Elven in a raid upon High Elven Felwithe. Arrows were fired, flame bolts swirled, and monstrous elementals toppled buildings. The guards fought back, but to little avail. They were swarmed over by the sheer number of the Dark Elven. Blood littered the ground that day.</p>
	<p>The casters of the tower had somehow sensed of this, for they were on the field in an instant. Paladin guards stormed out of the front building, where the Paladin Guild Hall was located. Magicians and Enchanters were on either side of the cliff near the entrance, Magicians summoning Golems and Weapons for use, Enchanters charming the opponents to fight for the High Elven. Wizards were on top of buildings, charging up for their devastating attacks. Clerics backed them up, hiding behind these same buildings, healing the Wizards in an effort to keep the Wizards alive while their powerful spells took effect.</p>
	<p>Emyrald’s father, guarded by many Dark Elven Warriors, stormed through the flank of Paladins. He and his warriors were aimed at destroying as much as possible before anything might be able to destroy them.</p>
	<p>In the chaotic madness, Numeras’ second in command lit fire to Numeras’ house while Emyrald and her mother were still inside. Numeras slayed he second with a swift bolt of fire. Not understanding why this might be, the Dark Elven believed of Emyrald’s father to be a traitor to his cause. They slew him with no remorse, and stormed into the house.</p>
	<p>Inside the house they found a High Elven body of a woman slumped across a crib. In the crib, that had found Emyrald.</p>
	<p>“By Innorruk, we see now, he was protecting these, who must have been his wife and daughter.” The Dark Elven soldiers were immediately humbled by the fact that they had slain a comrade. One stepped forth. He was a Dark Elven Cleric.</p>
	<p>“His babe is still alive. I will take it. None will harm this High Elven. I do indeed have an idea.” With that, the Cleric stepped forth and took Emyrald into his arms. He fingered the locket around her neck, which had her name inscribed upon it. The Cleric nodded, deciding that he would honor his fallen companion in keeping the name of his daughter. The Cleric muttered a mystical incantation, and globes of lightning appeared about him. Then, all of a sudden, the Cleric disappeared.</p>
	<p>Emyrald eventually learned from this Cleric, who called himself Detherean Ma’rkoth, that the High Elven had won the battle.</p>
	<p>Detherean had appeared in town, next to the Guild Hall of the Clerics. He did not immediately proceed home with his bundle. The few Guards remaining in the City would undoubtedly become suspicious. And so he went to the alter inside of his temple and prayed to the Prince of Hatred, Innoruuk. He prayed that an illusion be cast upon this, his new daughter, that would change her appearance from High Elven to that of a Dark Elven. His prayer was granted.</p>
	<p>Detherean had granted her the favor of telling her of her history. Since the Battle of Felwithe, and the fall of Numeras, he had severely lost faith in his former God, Innoruuk, and secretly worshipped Karana, the Lord of Rain, instead. By this new faith, he was no longer bound to keep his secrets from Emyrald, and he told her all that had happened, and all that she could do to regain her birthright.</p>
	<p>Emyrald returned to the present. She wiped the saliva that the Dark Elven Guard had just thrown at her off of her face, and proceeded forward.</p>
	<p>“Don’t you DARE walk from a chosen of Innorruk when he is talking to you!” He slapped her across the face.</p>
	<p>Detherean chose this moment to walk forward. He glared at the Guard, his red eyes glowing embers, his face expressionless except for the slight frown that his lips were making. The Guard backed off.</p>
	<p>“You are going, Emyrald? To reclaim your birthright?”</p>
	<p>Emyrald replied in her monotone fashion, one that she had picked up from being tormented for the past 16 years, “I am.”</p>
	<p>“Nothing will change your mind?” asked Detherean.</p>
	<p>Her silence was her answer.</p>
	<p>“Then know this, Emyrald. Know that I am always here for you. Your sister, Ayanamus, is as well. As are our friends Aethersfall, Talmara, Almara, and Wiyoo.” These had all been present at the battle – Wiyoo, protecting Felwithe, and the others following Innoruuk, whom they now despised for the grand carnage that had occurred at the battle. “These will help you on your way to Freeport, and, perhaps, to Kelethin. Know that your journey will be difficult, and that retrieving your birthright will be tiresome, but worth it doubly for every step. Now, I have bought you everything that you might require. Come back to our house for one last present.”</p>
	<p>Emyrald followed her father. She truly counted him as her father, for everything that he had ever done had been for her, while her own father had been a traitor. She followed Detherean to the Ma’rkoth residence.</p>
	<p>They reached their home. On the table was a blue-with-gold-lining robe. This was the Robe of the Oracle, an heirloom that the Ma’rkoth family had had for generations.</p>
	<p>“It is yours,” said Detherean quietly. “Put it on, along with these.” He reached under the Robe and pulled out some leggings that gleamed with the light of Moon. They were made of Silversilk.</p>
	<p>Emyrald took the presents and bowed. She also received the platinum that he allowed her to have. It would look conspicuous if a lowly Magician walked around with too much platinum in her pockets. “Thank you,” Emyrald said. “Tell your wife I say thank you to her also, and bear nothing but gratitude toward this house.”</p>
	<p>Emyrald turned towards the door. “When I am back, Father, please, do not be. I fear that the next time I am in Neriak, Neriak will burn.”</p>
	<p>“I understand. I had planned on moving to Freeport anyways. I have steadily been building the trust between the Ma’rkoth family and the humans of Freeport. We will be welcomed as refugees from Innoruuk.”</p>
	<p>“Good.” And with that, Emyrald left the house, and bolted from Neriak. The Guards looked at her conspicuously, but assumed that she was running to the aid of a friend. They did not learn of what became of Emyrald DeLunar until she was long gone from Neriak.</p>

<center><p>NOTES</center></p>
<p>Ok, for those of you who know who Emyrald is and how she's been a charactter for over 2 years (not in EQ, but AOL simming), I realize that there are some blaring incosistencies with Emyrald. First of all, her name is Emyrald, not Emerald. Then, she doesn't have blue hair anymore (but she still has red eyes!). Next, she's a mage, she's not using water, but <i>fire???</i> Bah! Emyrald from this point on will not use fire (she had to use burst of flame to get up to lvl 12, sorry guys). She might at the very, very end of her career, but mostly she will be using a conjuration of blades, etc (You'll notice that the only "Golems" that she will ever use will be water and air, and air only when she's pissed. Keeping in mind that, when Emyrald actually DOES getr pissed, she uses electricity and wind magic).</p>
<p> For those of you that have NOT heard of Emyrald before, for shame! I mean, honestly! Heehee. Nah, not many have heard of Emyrald. If you havn't guessed already, she's a monotone, near-mute, introverted, Dark Elf who is <i>supposed</i> to have blue hair and red eyes. That's all the information I'll provide. The rest, read yourself, or contact me ingame.</p>
