<p>If Only I Knew<br>
------------------------------- </p>

<p>If only I had known.if only.... I should have known that, we
could have never been at
peace. A Grail Knight and a Hell Lord? In love? Heh. It seems so
silly now. If only I had
known what I would do to her, I would have never gone to Faydwer
all those years ago.
Why did I choose to go there? Why?<br>
-------------------------------- </p>

<p>&quot;You have been hanging around me too much Meya. Were you
just going to leave without
saying goodbye?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; Actually yes.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm hurt&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;hehe. I have been around you too much.&quot; </p>

<p>Meya walked over to Raziel and he held her in his arms. </p>

<p>&quot;So where has the almighty council decided to send
you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Kunark. They believe that there are some relics that can
taken from the Iksar.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;..Kunark. Such a long way for such a young Necromancer.
And Paineel is going to be
devoid of beauty for a long time, such a shame. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Stop..You're just making this harder&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It is never supposed to be easy. I am going to miss
you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If all goes well, I should be back in half a year or so.
We can make up then.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No we cant.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Council orders, i am to perform reconnaissance on
various hostile cities and to acquire as
much knowledge possible on enemy spells, tatics and techniques. I
have no idea how long
I will be gone or even if I will even return at all.&quot; </p>

<p><br>
&quot;O Raziel...I wish we could have gotten a chance to..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You never know what may happen, we may yet. Besides, we
have a little more then two
hours before I have to leave. </p>

<p>&quot;Only 2? Not nearly enough&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We shall just have to make the most of it.&quot;<br>
------------------------------------------ </p>

<p>The elevator rumbled up to the surface. Meya and Raziel
exited, turned, and looked out
over the Chasm that led to Old Paineel. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you know where you are going to go Raziel? </p>

<p>&quot;Faydwer&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Any particular reason?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Not really&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah-huh. Going to spy on the elven women?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; You know me too well.&quot; </p>

<p>They kissed for the final time. </p>

<p>&quot;Be safe Meya.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You too Raziel&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel looked up to the midnight sky and his body began to
fade away. Just as his body completely faded out of sight, there was a bright flash. A raven
appeared in the Raziel's
place. It cawed and flew into the night.<br>
-------------------------------------- </p>

<p>It was quiet in the Heartwood Tavern tonight. A rather unusual
occurrence. The
bartender calmly washed out some of the glasses. The only other
person in the bar was a
stoutly dwarf who was obviously had too much, he was staggering
around, bumping into
furniture, singing various drinking songs. The bartender would
have tossed him out on his
ear, but seeing how it is so quiet tonight, and he needed a good
laugh. </p>

<p><br>
Then a small raven flew in through the open window. It circled
around and landed on the
dwarf's head. </p>

<p>&quot;Shooo! Shoooo! You seeeeellly bird!&quot; The dwarf
swatted at the raven. It hopped out of
his reach and hovered over him. Occasionally dropping within
reach to irritate the dwarf. The dwarf began to hop around the bar climbing on tables and
chairs trying to shoo away
the raven. The bartender laughed and laughed until his sides
hurt. Infuriated the dwarf
stumbled out the door. The raven stopped his chasing and flew
over to the bartender. It
landed on the bar table and cawed at him. </p>

<p>&quot;Well my little friend, you have chased away my only
customer. I should swat you with
this towel, but I needed a good laugh tonight. With the orcs
laying siege, everyone has
been in such a terrible mood lately.&quot; </p>

<p>The raven cawed again. </p>

<p>&quot;Here have this bit of steak, its not much, but I&#146;m
sure it is better then you are used
too.&quot; </p>

<p>The raven ate the steak, cawed once more, and flew out the
bar. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you treat all your patrons that well or just the
birds?&quot; </p>

<p>The bartender turned to face the voice. It was young Erudite
and on his shoulder was the
raven. </p>

<p>&quot;It depends on who the birds associate with.&quot; </p>

<p>The Erudite chuckled and sat down at the bar table. </p>

<p>&quot;You don&#146;t see many erudites around these parts or
many ravens either. So I guess you
and your friend are doubly rare. You both must be lost&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Not really, I am just wandering at the moment. But I
have to meet the King of Felwithe in
a few days.&quot; </p>

<p>The bartender whistled. &quot;The King of Felwithe impressive.
You must be one of Erudin's
Holy Paladins then.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Close..Templar&quot; </p>

<p>The bartender whistled again. &quot;I feel blessed that one of
Elrossi's finest has graced my
bar.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hmm.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Can I get you a drink?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How about some of that Honey mead, I have heard that
elven mead is the best in Norrath.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You are quite right&quot; he brought out a jug of mead
and was about to pour a glass. </p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s ok, ill take the bottle&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Really? It&#146;s strong and a bit pricey&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s ok&quot; The erudite pulled out a small coin
purse and removed 10 pieces of platinum. </p>

<p>&quot;Ahh lets see. You&#146;re an Erudite Templar, who
befriends ravens, who likes to drink, who is
rich, who is going to meet the king. How much rarer can you
be?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You never know.&quot; he picked up the jug and drank
heartily from it. &quot;My that is good.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I stock the best&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why is it so quiet tonight? I thought Kelethin was
supposed to be a busy city.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The calm you can thank the Crushbone orcs for. They have
laid siege a few miles from
here. They have everyone from Kelethin to Kaladim at the front
lines.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, seems like I picked a good time to drop by
then&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I guess so&quot; </p>

<p>The erudite took another drink and got up from the bar. </p>

<p>&quot;Have a good night&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You too&quot; </p>

<p>The raven cawed.<br>
------------------------- </p>

<p>/Must you socialize with everyone!?!/ </p>

<p>I need information, if I am going to accepted into Felwithe.
This attack by the orcs will
provide perfect cover for me. </p>

<p>/Yeah right. You just want to get drunk and chase elves/ </p>

<p>And this is a bad thing? </p>

<p>/No./ </p>

<p>Ok then. Besides your going to do a little spying for me. </p>

<p>/I here and obey master/ </p>

<p>Wise ass. </p>

<p>/I wonder were I picked that up?/ </p>

<p>Any way, fly over to the front lines and see if they are
planning anything. </p>

<p>/and what are you going to be doing while I do all the work?/ </p>

<p>Getting drunk and chasing elves. What else? </p>

<p>/Bah!/<br>
----------------------------- </p>

<p>Blades crashed together and yells echoed throughout Crushbone
territory. </p>

<p>&quot;Fall back! Fall back to the line!!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No. We won&#146;t leave you Commander!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Do as I order! You must get the weapons back into safe
hands!&quot; </p>

<p>The commander parried more blows from the orc. </p>

<p>&quot;GO!&quot; </p>

<p>The two remaining elves reluctantly turned and ran for the
cave. They heard blades
clashing together then a cry of pain. Then silence.. They
continued to run. </p>

<p>Meanwhile near the cave, upon the training hill. Raziel lay on
the ground, completely
hidden from view. </p>

<p>Are you sure they said tonight? </p>

<p>/Would you stop doubting me. They said they would try to
rescue the dwarf smith
tonight./ </p>

<p>Alright Alright. I shall try to have more faith in you. You
feather brain. </p>

<p>/HEY! This the form you gave me! You think I like being a
stupid bird?/ </p>

<p>You do realize, you can change shapes. </p>

<p>/....shut up/ </p>

<p>Haha </p>

<p>/here they come/ </p>

<p>Finally. </p>

<p>Blades crashed and then the sound of flesh ripping. </p>

<p>&quot;Silva!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Arorua, Run! Please get to the line.&quot; </p>

<p>The mortally wounded elf turned to face the oncoming orc
legonaires and slavers. She
charged them, blade held high. &quot;FOR TUNARE!!!&quot; </p>

<p>Arorua dashed for the cave, which was only a small distance
away. Then a centurion
stepped out of the cave, its blade held at ready. She was
trapped. </p>

<p>/Looks like she has her hands full....and thats not all thats
full. hmmm I see why you like
elves/ </p>

<p>Hmm. I take it you are finding new benefits of your present
form? </p>

<p>/having a birds-eye view is a wonderful thing./ </p>

<p>Hmm. How is she faring? </p>

<p>/Ok. She is surrounded. 1 Legionnaire, and three..scratch
that.. 2 slavers. She is quite
strong. She has bested 4 out of 7 orcs. Rather impressive for a
paladin. However, her
stamina is fading quickly, she will fall soon/ </p>

<p><br>
I guess I have to wait for just the right moment, to come
charging in. I will be a hero,
and welcomed into Felwithe. And maybe she will be so happy as to
give me a small
reward. Which would be nice. </p>

<p>She blocked more blows, but her ebbing strength finally gave
up and the legionnaire
knocked her sword away. </p>

<p>Here it is. Time to go! </p>

<p>She was knocked to the ground. The legionnaire smiled and
brought his sword down. She
braced herself for the final blow. It never came. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you just going to sit on your butt all day or are
you going to get up?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Huh !?!&quot; she looked up. An Erudite stood before
her. The three orcs were dead. </p>

<p>&quot;Who..&quot; </p>

<p>He knelt down. Offering her his hand &quot;Raziel. I was sent
from Erudin to restart relations
with Felwithe. and the little guy on my shoulder is my pet raven
Reyas&quot; </p>

<p>/PET!!!! PET MY A../ </p>

<p>Shush! </p>

<p>She took his hand and stood up. &quot;My people and myself owe
you a deep debt. I only wish
you could have showed a few minutes earlier.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The past can not be changed. And wishing doesn&#146;t do
anything. Only you can change
the present.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I guess so.&quot; She knelt over the body of Silva and
said a quick prayer. </p>

<p>&quot;Shall we head back to the line?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Lets go.&quot; </p>

<p>They began the long walk towards the front line. </p>

<p>&quot;Want some Mead?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I've just met you and your already trying to get me
drunk.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Never hurts to try. &quot;<br>

Ch 8 Home Away From Home<br>
------------------------------ </p>

<p>&quot;I must say, it is interesting to meet an Erudite this
far out. Especially since Commandant
Shaltvar, prohibited any one from entering or exiting
Erudin.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Like I said before Mathasar. The Commandant wants to
reopen relations with Felwithe.
Especially since the Heretics, have been getting rather uppity
lately. Their patrols are
coming closer and closer to Erudin, we feel they are going to
strike soon.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So Erudin is getting trampled by their mess, and comes
to us like whipped dogs?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe. Nevertheless, the Heretics are your problem too.
If Erudin falls, their next stop
will be Fawdyer. The enemy of my enemy is my friend as the old
saying goes.
Unfortunately, you stuck-up High-elfs are it. So, deal with it,
Mathasar. </p>

<p>&quot;Call me Commander.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'll call you what I like. Mathasar.&quot; </p>

<p>---------------------------- </p>

<p>Outside the command tent, Arorua intercepts Raziel who was
apparently lost in the camp. </p>

<p>&quot; For an ambassador, you aren&#146;t doing a very good
job so far. Unless ticking off one of the
King's most loyal Commander's is a great way to open diplomatic
relations?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Eh.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;O well. He needed to be set straight. He is a jerk, only
wish it didn&#146;t have to take an
outsider to do it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Outsiders can sometimes see things you don&#146;t.&quot;
</p>

<p>&quot;True&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So...want to go get a drink?&quot; </p>

<p>/Your becoming a drunk/ </p>

<p>&quot;Again?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, its not like I have anything else to do&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Shouldn&#146;t you be working on seeing the King?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;O yeah. I knew I forgot something&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;hehe&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So shall we go Felwithe?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well I need a guide. I'm likely to get lost out
here&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, I do still need to take the weapons back to the
blacksmiths&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Good. Then its settled, we are going to Felwithe...do
they have good mead in Felwithe?&quot; </p>

<p>/Your Hopeless/ </p>

<p>&quot;Your Hopeless.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I know......do they?&quot;<br>
----------------------------- </p>

<p>They began to wind around the final leg of the journey to
Felwithe. They stopped upon a
hill facing the great Castle City of Felwithe. </p>

<p>&quot;Wow. This is impressive. I bet this cost a lot&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Probably. But I wouldn&#146;t know. It was built long
before I was born.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I didn&#146;t think you were that
old......well....maybe.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hmph! Im barely 57!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yet, you dont look a day over 56.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wise guy.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; Heh.&quot; </p>

<p>They continued down the hill and walked towards the entrance.
The Guards stopped them </p>

<p>&quot;HALT! Who goes there!&quot; </p>

<p>Arorua reached underneath her armor and pulled out a small
amulet and held it out before
the Guards </p>

<p>&quot;I wonder what else you&#146;re hiding under there?&quot;
</p>

<p>Arorua ignored him. And waited on the Guards to let them bye. </p>

<p>&quot;So nothing at all?&quot; </p>

<p>She blushed, and hurried through the entrance.<br>
---------------------------------<br>
&quot;Arorua!!! It&#146;s so great to see you!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hi Janus!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So what is new?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Quite a bit. I brought some things from the front
line.&quot; </p>

<p>She handed him a finely crafted mace and special chainmail. </p>

<p>&quot;O my! Such quality, Such craftsmanship. Oh my. Telvious
must have made these. I
thought he had been captured by the orcs?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;He is, but we smuggled these out last night&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So that&#146;s where Grandarfal and Silva went! Wow with
a few of these, this siege will be
over soon. Where are they? We must celebrate!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;They didn&#146;t make it...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh no..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;They gave their life to get these out. I probably would
have joined them if Raziel hadn&#146;t
intervened.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Who is Raziel?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;An Erudite Templar, sent from Erudin to establish an
alliance with us. He saved my life.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Then I owe him a drink&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ummm..no.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Long story&quot;<br>
----------------------------------<br>
Later on, Arorua found Raziel standing on one of the guard
towers. She hopped up to the
tower and stood beside him. </p>

<p>&quot;So, this is where you have been hiding&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yep&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Heard you got an appointment with the King in the
morning. You must have made quite an impression&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I do my best&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So Ambassador, what is first on your agenda with the
King&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; Dunno&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; Ok..how about second?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Not a clue&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Do you have any plan for your meeting with the
King?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Nope&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hmm....ok....So for a start, what are the going to call
you when they introduce you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ambassador Eom'brn&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Eom'brn? isnt that..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Teir'dal? Yes. It sounds better then a Templar
Ambassador named Darkborne&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;True..but why Teir'dal?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Its a family name&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Huh???..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s enough about me. What about you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Kaya&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Arorua Kaya. Starfire Princess. Nice. One who radiates
such beauty deserves such a
name.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You&#146;re quite the charmer aren&#146;t you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I try to excel at what I do&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Including drinking?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No exceptions&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, you better hold off for tonight. You have a big
meeting in the morning&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'll try&quot;<br>
----------------------------------- </p>

<p>&quot;Sir, please wait here until the King summons you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Fine&quot; </p>

<p>The squire entered the King's chambers and closed the doors
behind him. Raziel yawned
and leaned back against the wall. A few moments later Arorua
entered the room. </p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, I owe you my life. The least I can do is help you
talk with the King.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Great. I could use a hand.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Glad to be of help then.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;....So what's his name again?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Who?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The King&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;!!!!! You don&#146;t even know the King's name and your
trying to make an Alliance!?!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I have a bad memory.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Humph&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I thought you said you were going to help me?&quot; </p>

<p>Arorua exhaled loudly. </p>

<p>&quot;Why did the Commandant pick you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Because I&#146;m one of his best&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Uh-huh. His Name is King Tearis Thex&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That was going to be my first guess&quot; </p>

<p>She rolled her eyes at him. </p>

<p>&quot;Sir, Milady. The King will see you now.&quot; The squire
opened the great doors to the
chambers. They entered the large room and waited. The squire
introduced them. </p>

<p>&quot;The Ambassador from Erudin. Ambassador Raziel
Eom'brn.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel moved before the Kings throne. </p>

<p>&quot;and his Advisor Milady Arorua Kaya&quot; </p>

<p>Arorua moved up beside Raziel. </p>

<p>2 Grail Knights and his Advisors; Caerdwill Pwrodealian, a
magician and Morgann
Bernheardt, the commander of all the Felwithe forces encircled
the King. </p>

<p>Arorua kneeled down before them &quot;M'lord&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Young Kaya. I see you are advising our guest.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I am M'lord&quot; </p>

<p>She rose to her feet. </p>

<p>Raziel walked forward and saluted the King. &quot;It is an
honor to meet you Sire.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I never thought, I would live to see the embargo on
Erudin removed. I am honored to be
present in these dealings.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well now that we have got the pleasantries out of the
way, shall we cut to the
negotiations? </p>

<p>&quot;I like someone is direct. Please continue&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ok. The Commandant wants aid in destroying the
infestation of the Heretics before they
attack us. We want 3 contingents of your paladins, one contingent
of Grail Knights, and
whatever magicians and wizards you can provide&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And what do we get out of this&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Gratitude and our smiling faces&quot; </p>

<p>The King chuckled. </p>

<p>&quot;It will take more then that. You ask much of us, we
could not possibly spare even a
quarter of what you ask, with the Crushbone Orcs bearing down
upon our borders&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;In exchange for your military aid, we will train your
knights with our techniques. We will
give no more then that.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s all? You should not have even wasted your
time Templar. My knights are the
finest in all the lands. Your training would do more then sully
their skills.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s a shame that you believe that...&quot; Raziel
disappeared. </p>

<p>He reappeared in front of the King with his blade at his neck
&quot;for it will cost you your life.&quot; </p>

<p>/I can&#146;t believe you just used that technique, in the
middle of the lion's den!! Are you trying to kill yourself?/ </p>

<p>The two Grails knights hesitated unsure of what they had just
seen. </p>

<p>&quot;Had your 'finely trained' knights had any skills, they
would have stopped me. But look at
where my blade is. Now do you still think your knights are highly
trained?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Gahhh! you..you&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel pressed his blade some more against the King's neck </p>

<p>&quot;Were you saying something?&quot; He pulled his sword
back and sheathed it. He jumped back
beside Arorua who was dumbstruck. </p>

<p>The King rubbed his neck. &quot;Alright. If you train my
knights AND help us deal with our
enemies, we will help you deal with the heretics&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Good. Have a nice Day&quot; </p>

<p>He waved to them and left the chambers. </p>

<p>&quot;He bears much watching sire. However, I feel his offer
is genuine. My word, if even 3 of
our Knights could move with the speed and skill he just did ...
even I couldn&#146;t track his
movements&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Interesting, what about you Morgann?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I have to agree Sire. He is strong, his training could
prove valuable.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Very, well then. Arorua, you are to keep watch over him,
make sure he doesn&#146;t have any
alterior motives.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes M'lord&quot; </p>

<p>--------------------------------- </p>

<p>Crashes echoed through the small training arena. Blades boomed
together as Raziel and
Arorua traded some blows </p>

<p>&quot;I can&#146;t believe you did that!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, it was easier that way.&quot; </p>

<p>They traded more blows. </p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, it was either waste time arguing with him, or just
prove him wrong&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Uh-huh. Are we as poorly trained as you made us out to
be?&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel stopped and backed up. Leaned against his sword. </p>

<p>&quot;Your not that bad, quite the contrary your people are
quite skilled. It&#146;s just that, your
techniques waste too much time and energy. Your incident in
Crushbone is a perfect
testament to that.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Simple, you single-handily defeated 4 orcs out of 7. But
what happened then?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was exhausted, I couldn&#146;t go on&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Exactly my point, had your techniques not been so
stamina hungry, you could have
beaten all 7.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;O.k. What is the first thing that is wrong with our
techniques?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, first of all, your swing your sword too far and
too hard. Second you&#146;re pivoting your
hips too much, and especially for you that's a lot of hip. No
wonder you tired so quickly.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What did you say!!!!!&quot; She charged him making wild
swings. He jumped and dodged out of
the way. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey! Easy! Easy! Chill out! I&#146;m too much of a
gentle men to fight ladies with big hips!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why you!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You shouldn&#146;t let your anger get a hold of you
Arorua. It makes you crazy and do rash things&quot; said an armored figure standing at the door </p>

<p>Arorua halted and faced the figure. &quot;M'lord Karasir&quot;
</p>

<p>&quot;Karasir? Not the Karasir, that single handily saved the
royal family of Kaladim?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So you heard of me?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Your exploits have reached even the sealed continent of
Odus.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And I have heard have your exploits, not many would dare
humiliate the king and his
advisors like that.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well I like to be different&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Would you do me the honor of a small duel? I would love
to see the skills that could
humiliate our King's Guard.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I would be happy to accept.&quot; </p>

<p>/That&#146;s a freakin Grail Lord Raziel!!!!/ </p>

<p>So? I won&#146;t humiliate him too much </p>

<p>/Your going to have to force a draw. If you beat him, you&#146;ll
surely be tossed out on your
ear for totally humiliating Felwithe. If you lose, you&#146;ll be
kicked out for not having the
skills you claim./ </p>

<p>You&#146;re not telling me anything new </p>

<p>/you are way to confident/ </p>

<p>So you say </p>

<p>* </p>

<p>Karasir drew his sword and circled around Raziel analyzing him
looking for a weakpoint in
his stance. Raziel held still, he let Karasir circle around
entirely. Then they paused,
waiting for the other to make the first move. Karasir made the
move, his blade cut
nothing but air as Raziel jumped backwards into the air and
landed a good distance away. </p>

<p><br>
Karasir charged, his sword whirled out, again meeting only air as
Raziel dodged away from
his strikes. </p>

<p>&quot;Is this all your so called techniques consist of? Or do
u actually attack your opponent?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We attack but only when it is beneficial!&quot; Raziel
surged forward then whirled around
Karasir crashing the back of his hand against him. Karasir
stumbled, but quickly reoriented
himself and readied himself. </p>

<p>&quot;Hmm. A nice move lets see you do it again.&quot; </p>

<p>The rushed each towards each other, their blades slamming
together. They parried and
thrust their swords again and again. Driving each other back and
forth through the
training arena, eventually spilling outside to the main section
of the Castle City. Now with
more room, they began to jump from rooftop to rooftop parrying
blows. The duel
continued through the city coming to the city entrance, their
blades clashed together
one more time then they jumped back away from each other. </p>

<p>Karasir breathed heavily &quot;You are quite good. But I think
the so called skills you wish to
impart to us are nothing compared to what we already have.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe, Maybe not. But then again I&#146;m not the one
who is already tired.&quot; </p>

<p>The tensed again ready to leap at each other, when commotion
came from the front
gate. *
One of the front guards was carrying a wounded ranger inside.
They rushed over to him. </p>

<p>&quot;Hang on young one. Your safe with in Tunare's walls
now&quot;
&quot;M'lord..kara..sir....We..need..help...orcs...have broken<br>
the...line.......Kelethin...is...tak...... </p>
