          <p><font color='#000000'>Shadow Knights are a hybrid class tank; they take the shape of a
          cross between a Warrior and Necromancer, having the second highest
          tanking ability in game after warriors, and having some fairly useful
          spells to aid them in battle. The concept of the Shadow Knight is the
          dark warrior at the forefront of the battle fighting savagely and
          using well-placed spells to weaken the enemy and empower himself.</font></p>
          <p><font color='#000000'>The start of a Shadow knights life can be very difficult and many
          people give up rather than face the challenge, but rest assured that
          Shadow Knights evolve into a powerful class if you
          are willing to put the time in.</font></p>
          <p><font color='#000000'>The difficulties to begin with come from the light arsenal of
          spells at A Shadow Knights command, coupled with the low damage output. This is
          due to the fact you cannot kick or dual wield, and have to wait till
          higher levels to receive skills and increased damage caps. Once these
          points are reached the going gets much easier, and towards the end the
          skills you miss out on will amount to little and the caps no longer
          affect you.</font></p>
          <p><font color='#000000'>Even though Shadow Knights miss out on some
          combat skills, they still
          receive taunt, parry, dodge, riposte,
          disarm and double attack.&nbsp; Whilst they will not ever be as effective
          to them&nbsp; as they are to a warrior, they still make significant
          impact on their tanking ability. Because Shadow Knights are a hybrid
          class you will have to wait
          longer than to attain these skills than the pure melees, but don't give
          up, the wait is worth it.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color='#000000'>With the exception of Iksars, being able to
        wear plate armour helps immensely.&nbsp; It gives Shadow Knights higher AC armour than
        many other melee classes.&nbsp; Shadow Knights also have one of the
        highest defense caps in the game.&nbsp; In later levels Shadow Knights
        receive Feign Death.&nbsp; This is one of the best spells in
          the game, enabling you to fool mobs into thinking you're dead and
          leave you alone.&nbsp; This is not only used to save your life, but
        can also be used to do some amazing things in pulling groups of monsters
        once you become more adept at its use.</font></p>
          <p><font color='#000000'>Although damage wise Shadow Knight spells are fairly weak,
          they receive some excellent utility <a href='http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/shadowknight' target='_blank' class='db2'><b>spells</b></a>.
          Shadow Knights are the only hybrid class which receives a pet.&nbsp; Although
          they&nbsp; may pale
          in comparison to Necromancer pets of similar level characters, their damage over the course of
          a battle can be the difference between life and death if soloing.&nbsp;
          They can also be a great distraction if you find yourself over powered and
          have to flee. Shadow Knights also receive the very useful darkness series&nbsp;
          of spells.&nbsp; This is a DOT which also has a snaring effect.&nbsp;
          Coupled with fear it becomes a lethal
          combination for soloing, enabling you to kill blue and above enemies
          taking only minimal damage.&nbsp; They also receive lifetaps which help
          their overall
          performance in battle and reduce downtime.</font></p>
          <p><font color='#000000'>Shadow Knights are a diverse class great for groups and probably
          the only melee class that can solo experience-giving mobs after level
          35 due to the darkness/fear combo. The Shadow Knights group role is as
          a tank and
          puller. As the group tank you will be absorbing damage from enemies,
          keeping mobs off group casters and giving out damage through melee and
          spells, whilst as a puller you can weaken incoming mobs with drain spells and
          use feign death on high risk pulls.</font></p>
          <p><font color='#000000'>If you are someone into a big challenge but with high rewards then
          the Shadow Knight class is for you, once you reach level 30 you begin
          to receive very useful spells and there are few skills of importance
          which you will not have by then.&nbsp; That is when you will begin to
          receive the rewards of the class and you will not be disappointed.</font></p>

        <p><b><font color='#800000'>Statistics</font></b></p>
        <p><b>Strength:</b> Strength determines how much you can carry.&nbsp; It
        influences maximum and average damage and how quickly you learn many
        offensive skills.&nbsp; Shadow Knights wear plate armour, which can weigh large
        amounts at upper levels.&nbsp; Also as a primary melee class they will get more damage done with their weaponry with higher
        strength.&nbsp; Points should be allocated here at creation.<p><b>Stamina:</b> Stamina affects how many hit points you have, and how
        long you can hold your breath.&nbsp; The number of hitpoints gained from
        increasing this statistic is very minimal and Shadow Knights do not need
        to worry about this statistic at the beginning of their careers.<p><b>Agility:</b> Agility affects how quickly you can learn some
        defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much
        damage you take when you are hit.&nbsp; The true effect of Agility is
        often debated.&nbsp; Since Shadow Knights do perform the role of a tank
        they can get hit a lot in combat.&nbsp; Because of this there is
        sound argument for putting points into this statistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Dexterity:</b> Dexterity affects how quickly you learn weapon
        skills, and how often weapons will do their special.&nbsp; Since Shadow
        Knights get a number of weapons which proc, and some spells which do
        this also, there is a definite advantage to putting some points into
        this statistic.&nbsp; It will also help to increase their channelling
        skill so they are not interrupted as often when hit while casting.</p>
        <p><b>Wisdom:</b> Wisdom affects the amount of mana the priest classes
        have, also rangers and paladins.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also affects how quickly
        you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than your
        Intelligence.&nbsp; This skill has absolutely no relevance for the
        Shadow Knight class and bonus points should not be put into it.<p><b>Intelligence:</b> Intelligence directly affects how quickly you
        can learn most skills.&nbsp; It affects the amount of mana for Bards and
        all pure casters, as well as Shadow Knights.&nbsp; A lot of Shadow
        Knight spells are mana intensive, and they use it up very quickly.&nbsp;
        Putting some points into this stat is certainly worthwhile for getting
        some extra spells off, but items which give large amounts of direct Mana
        are more efficient at later levels.</p>
        <p><b>Charisma</b>: This affects amount you will be paid for goods by
        NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you.&nbsp; There is no need to
        put points into this statistic at creation.</p>
        <p><strong><font color='#800000'>Picking the Right Race</font></strong></p>
        <p>The first thing you have to pick then is your race.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which
        race you pick will determine the foundation of you character for the
        rest of your life in Norrath so it is kind of important you pick one you
        like.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of differences between Shadow Knight
        races which can influence your decision.</p>
        <p>Firstly different Shadow Knight races level at different
        speeds.&nbsp; Dark Elves, Humans, and Erudites level the fastest.&nbsp;
        Ogres level quite a bit slower than these races.&nbsp; Trolls and Iksar
        level even slower than Ogres.&nbsp; It will take an Iksar or Troll
        Shadowknight more than twice the experience to reach Level 60 compared
        to a Halfling warrior.&nbsp; So be prepared for a long haul if you
        choose one of these Races.</p>
        <p>Humans and Erudites also have no knight vision, which could be a
        problem if you do not know you geography well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Erudites also
        have a naturally high magical resistance.&nbsp; Keep in mind also that
        you will not be able to make an Erudite Shadow Knight unless you have
        downloaded the optional patch to install the Paineel zone.&nbsp; This
        comes standard with Kunark installations.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Iksars and Trolls do have one key advantage over the other
        classes.&nbsp; They both regenerate their health much faster.&nbsp; This
        is especially important when feigning death as it allows you to heal
        much faster whilst you are immobilized.&nbsp; Iksars also get a natural
        AC boost to make up for not wearing plate armour, but the true impact of
        this at high levels is still unknown.</p>
        <p>Ogres have an advantage in that they cannot be stunned from melee
        attacks when hit from the front.&nbsp; This can be very helpful
        throughout your characters life.&nbsp; They also have the highest
        strength and the most hitpoints of any race choice.</p>
        <p>Faction wise, most Shadow Knights are not liked very much.&nbsp;
        Iksars can only trade in Cabilis.&nbsp; Erudites and Humans have a
        little more choice, but religion can sometimes be problematic for
        them.&nbsp; Your choice will not matter too much here as you are fairly
        restricted no matter which race you pick.</p>
