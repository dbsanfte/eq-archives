  <tr><td class='db'> </td></tr>
  <tr><td class='db'>There I was wandering aimlessly around Qeynos for yet another day of nothing much, everything had lost it’s challenge and getting revenge on everything that had killed me in younger days was wearing very thin.  I knew that I needed a change, but what? Where should I go? I thought and thought but for the life of me couldn’t come up with an answer.  Then I remembered that I am not alone in my journeys, and that I have an entire group of friends that I can ask.  The question was easy, “does anyone know where I can go for fun and excitement?”  (Of course experience was just an added bonus). The replies came quickly from so many of the guild members “you need to go to Oasis.”  So naturally not being extremely worldly I had to ask, “where is Oasis?” This answer came just as quickly as the first “Near Freeport.”


So there I was, faced with the decision of staying in Qeynos for the rest of my life, and dying of sheer boredom, or taking a risk and heading for a new horizon.  Well at first I thought “Wow! Will I really be able to make a run like that?” Alas my curiosity got the better of me and I had to see Oasis.  Knowing Commander Tathus was getting just as bored with Qeynos as I was, I asked him if he would like to join me on a journey across the continent to Freeport.  He agreed.  Thus begins my story.

West Karana was easy; I’d been through there a hundred times before.  I knew well the tower I had run to in younger days when I had gotten in over my head with a lion or two.  I remembered well the path I had to take to get to east Karana, although I had crossed the border only once.  This day was different though, I knew once I crossed that border it would be the last time I would see West Karana for a very long time.  Once I crossed the border into East Karana there would be no turning back.  

East Karana was not very familiar at all, I had only been there once before with a dear and trusted friend.  This time it was different, this time I was without a guide. (Tathus had never been there before).  So here I was I knew I had to keep going, after all the most surefire way to get killed is to stand still and wait for something to attack you. Commander Dayral kept tabs on us throughout the journey and told us the direction in which we needed to head, also with a few reminders to him about missing portions of his directions from Vlad =).  Watching for many enemies I was warned to avoid I started running.  Before I knew it I was at the next zone border.

Highpass was nothing like I had expected at all.  I had heard horror stories of many high level monsters that appear out of nowhere and kill you.  I had seen nothing that had caused me to worry nor had I seen anything that posed a threat to me at all.  Once again Commander Dayral offered directions and through Highpass I ran.

The Kithicor wood was the next zone.  I had definitely never been to Kith before and I most certainly never heard anything about the woods.  With one announcement to the guild that I was Kith Dayral told me that I needed to wait there until dawn (7am).  This is when an ice cold chill ran down my spine and I thought “Oh my goodness I am going to die here, I have made it this far and I am going to die right here near the zone to Kith, and not really knowing where I am.”  Dayral then said that I could do that or I could SOW myself and Tathus and we could run for it (along the zone border). A slight sigh of relief came over me; I had an option. (Might I add that I did manage to make myself a couple platinum pieces for SOWing a gnome while I was standing there.)  The option had come something like “or you can be brave and make a run for it.”  While I was contemplating my next move I started receiving words of encouragement from my fellow Knights of Lore.  I said to myself “Okay Kitten, you can do this they have faith in you have some faith in yourself and go for it.”  The forest was dark, and all was still except for the sounds of owls and howling wolves in the distance.  I could feel the coldness in the air yet it was a warm night, something evil was out there in the darkness I could feel it.  When we go to the zone border we had a slight scare when right by the border we saw a dread wolf.  Just as I started to panic, that it was over and I was going to die, the wolf ran in the other direction, I then felt the presence of the gods upon me.  I had made it through this dark and evil place. I was now in West Commonlands.

Dayral once again offered us direction and advice to dodge giants. When I heard the word giants I decided that I needed to bind myself on the very spot I was standing.  I would not have wanted to go through that cold, dark forest again.  I stopped, someone had reached out and hugged me, when I turned around I saw Commander Dreygus.  I yelled to Tathus, “STOP!”  I had not been exactly sure at that point what was happening through the rush of emotion I felt at the sight of another Knight.  Suddenly I wasn’t worried about the dangers around me I knew I would be okay I was with someone that knew where I was going and just how to get there.  Someone that was willing to show me the way.  Dreygus then told both Tathus and I to drop SOW, (I had no idea why) I did as I was asked without hesitation.  Before I knew it I was in wolf form (Sweet!).  I had forgotten all about that, I one day would be able to do that as well.  Then the run began, I remember running by many small houses, and wondering as we were running if perhaps the first to run this distance was perhaps drunk when they had worn the paths.  Commander Dreygus pointed out the tunnel to Northern Ro and told us that it was the newbie area and that it was a fairly safe place to be.  A little more running and we were in Freeport.  At last I had reached my destination.  

The good Commander showed us the way to the bank, the merchants and the guild where we would be able to buy our spells.  It was nothing like I was expecting, sandy and dry, not like the green grassy areas and rain that I had grown up with.  The sky was blue and not a drop of rain was to be seen, not even the slightest threat of a storm.  I realized then that Freeport was where I wanted to stay, my new home.  Dreygus then showed us the way to Oasis.  I felt the warmth of the air and marveled at the vast beach that I knew I would spend many a day on killing numerous enemies, making new friends and growing.  I learned where orc highway was and with some assistance I killed my first orc ever.  Wow! What a rush!

Thus ended my long journey across an entire continent through vast plains and high mountains to my new home.  Perhaps one day I will find the courage to head back to my birthplace in Kelethin.  I know that while I am in Freeport and exploring Oasis, I shall not be bored again for quite some time.  I do not yet know what will happen to me, however I shall welcome whatever may come my way good or bad.  I hope to make many new friends and to perhaps see more of the many friends I have made within the Knights of Lore.
