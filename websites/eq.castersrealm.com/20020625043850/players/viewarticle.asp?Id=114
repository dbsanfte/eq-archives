	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td width='100%'><font face='verdana' size='2pt'>Night fell slowly tonight and it didn't surprise Hawkson one bit. For several nights he had been subjected to nightmares and horrors in his sleep, and he saw for a reson. As a child growing up he only had the help of his dear grandfather to help him understand exactly who he was. His grandfather unlike his father was a powerful druid of the high councel, back when it still existed. While his father was an equaly powerful ranger on the same councel.When the head Druids and Rangers of the forrests left the sides of one another as did Hawkson's family. His father left to aid the queen and joined the elven royal army as a honored General. While his grandfather, seeking a quiet life, raised young Hawkson.

	Hawkson had long since seen his father and grandfather pass on but still carried their memories in his heart. On his grandfathers death bed he was given a signet ring embued with a power within a power. A gift of magick without the use of any destructive forces, as his grandfather had said. It would protect him, and it did. It gave him premonitions and brough forth prophecies to him in the form of nightmares.

	He sat quietly watching as the sun disappeared behind the ridge and felt the warm glow of the not so distant torches. His new group would hopefully last longer than the last.They dissipated from constant bickering between the leader and a dwarf, both great warriors, but couldn't work out the details of sharing the loot. But this time was different they weren't treasure hunters or theifs, this was Hawkson's type of group. This was balistic squad like the one his father led durring the great Crushbone raids that Hawk always heard about before he went to sleep as a child. Their main pourpose was that of rescue and tactic forces. Hawkson had volenteered to join when the group marched through Kelethin tward Crushbone looking for a renegade group of so called "AWOLers". He immediately took notice of a young attractive elven girl named Zolween they hired as a guide and the team leader: a mysterious but trustworthy knight named Sir Blake.

	
The first night they stayed in the Inn so the heart of the team could have all their armor and wepons shined and refined before reuniting with the second group. While the group slept Hawk and Zol sat on the roof and enjoyed the night air and chatted all night.

	Bright and early the next morn they set out following the trails and following young Zolween, to the massive enterance of Crushbone. Nobody talked much and the more Orc tents they passed the more worried Sir Blake got. The myst was thick this morning thicker than usual, he wouldn't be surprised to see it rain before supper. A few times as a chipmunk would scurry by Hawkson would see Blake and a guard or two reach for a sword or bow. He knew deep down this group had heart but he could easily see that they had no battle experience. 
	They took their time getting to Crushbone, wanting to avoid every Orc camp and the obvious Orc trails and traps. Several times along the way would a guard nearly stumble into a trap or walk into a tree fortunatly Zol knew the area and they eventually made it.

	The memories flashed by Hawkson's eyes pretty fast and he was back to reality. It was dark now and the torches from Castle Crushbone shone bright. One of the squads scouts retuned in a hurry and promptly reported:
"The Orcs are all in the mess hall sir, the rest of the compound is virtually unguarded."
And without even thinking Blake responded like the captin he was "Alright we're moving out. We'll circle around to the back by those camps we saw earlier and enter the caves there. And thats where our squad should be." and he motioned for everyone to move out and they did. Except for Hawk and Zol who felt a little dumbfounded.
"What do you think he ment by should be?" asked Zol
Hawk just flashed her a kind hearted glance of comfort and she relaxed

	The plan went like clockwork. The squad moved slowly but made little sound. They easaly got past a couple of Orc lookouts and never even looked back. They might not have had much fighting experience but someone took every precaution to teach these guys about sneaking in and using shadows to an advantage. They slipped through the camp and entered the cave without a probolem.

	Coming around a corner with Blake in the lead they saw their team in the main chamber. Attacked and captured they were stripped of their clothing and chained to the walls. The squad, happy and excited ran in and immediatly supplied medical attention and food to the weary men.

	A look of satisfaction and happiness came across in the smiles and faces of both crews. Never in Hawks life has he ever seen such a happy crowd to see one another. Everyone was talking and smiling and helping each other to their feet and it was clearly a spectical. Zol even buisied herself binding wounds and unpacking staffs of wood collected to make necessary gurney's and canes. The sight was joyous to everyone and when he would return to to town he would have a fine story to tell. 

	But the smile on Hawkson's face grew cold and stiff and slowly his face lost all color...In a moment of glee Zolween glanced up at Hawson and her smile slowly faded as well . A look of shear terror entered Hawkson's eyes and their normal shade of brown became the no-color of smoke and wind. Horrified Zol stood up and went to Hawk's side and grabed his arm. But he didn't know, he was somewhere else beyond reality.
"What is it Hawk?" she asked
Hawk didn't know what to say all he could do was stair at the squad in their happiness. Slowly he was engulfed by a sadness
"What is it?" she asked again
This time he mumbled..."Do you know anything about Crusbone Orcs?"
"No, not really...."
"I know what my father told me about them as a boy." he continued
"And whats that?"
his eyes slowly moved down and met hers as he slowly and quietly replied "Orcs,  don't take prisoners..."

	And with that he felt a warm gust of air on the back of his neck. It could have been there all along without him even realizing it. Zol stepped away from him and her eyes rose, in the reflection of them Hawk could see a dozen Orcs, maybe more. He dropped his hands to his side and felt the gifts his father left to him. A pair of fine steel hand made elven claws. They were strapped in specialy made packs on his thighs for a quick equip.As Zol gasped for air and got ready to scream at the sight of the orcs, Hawk had already slipped into his gloves. 

	She screamed and Hawk revolved on the heels of his boots turning himself tward the crowd. The orc that had been breathing on him was much uglier than his father had ever described one and without hesitation he lept into a barrage of slashing and kicking. He unknowingly began screaming.  He tore out with one arm the second went in to replace it. He was like a possessed dog frantically burring a bone. The Orc was suddenly lying on the floor and Hawk was sitting on it's chest continuing with his assault. At breif points in the excitement a thought  would cross his mind or a memory blur of child happiness and innocence. He felt powerful and ready!	
	He felt a wave of warm air brush past him waving his hair and the deafening sound of armor banging as the batalion moved past him to aid him in his battle. He could hear swords clanging and crossbows firing seemingly hundreds of war cries and screams echoed in the damp smallness of the cave. He pulled himself up and looked at the puddled mass of nothing under him. There was little left of it. And what was left, he was wearing half of it. Hawk thought that his father never told him how messy these things were on the inside, and it made him grin.

His sight came across a massive Orc that was taking on two men and holding it's own pretty well, it had to be a royal guard or some type of high class because of its sheer size over the rest. Hawkson didn't think twice, he didn't need to in battle he was acting on the instinct he received from his father. He snuck up behind and jumped on. Using his claws to climb up it's back like a dead tree's trunk, making his way to the top. He swung one massive arm under its neck to hold on,  and began thrusting his left fist into what ever he could. His claws began stabbing and swinging like a celing fan. it in the back, shoulders, head, and neck. He opened his eyes enough to see the two men below him scatter and dive when the beast came tumbling down right where they were standing. He rode the beast down and made sure it wouldn't get back up.On the floor he rolled off and hopped up. He quickly regained his bearings and fixed his vision to see that the room was a mess of blood and bodies and it looked as thought the squad was losing. He could only watch in horror to see one orc pin down a guard while another ran him through. Looking a different way he saw an Orc murder one of the first squad that never got un chained from the wall. 
He spun around in time to see a large blunt club knock him square on the temple. Hawk was sent sprawling to the floor falling in a massive puddle of multicolored green and red blood staining his knees and gloves. He felt horendous pain and saw colors he never knew existed. He tried to get back to his feet but was denined when the club struck him in the ribs on his left side rolling him into the puddle once again. Rolling in pain onto his back he saw the monster hitting him as being a pint sized pawn, shorter than even him. Clearing his vision in time he managed to roll away as the blunt heavaly struck the ground where he once was and managed to land back on his feet. With a quick right uppercut the club fell from the orc's hand and the Orc's body slumped up against the wall. Hawkson removed the majority of the Orc's face and frontal skull left on his claws and flinged the slop at headless mass that slumped down seconds before. 

	Hawk quickly scowered the room searching for Zol . Tearing and franticly moving bodies searcing, he found her lying on the floor badly injured. A rusty spear had been hurled and it took its toll in her left breast. Blood was leaking bad and Hawkson knew she was lung shot. He rolled her over and looked at her face. She just smiled without opening her eyes she knew it was him.
" I can still help..." she managed to mumble before Hawkson placed his finger across her lips
"You did great, kid." he replied  
She raised her arm and waved it around weakly, and she cried from the pain the movement caused her. But from behind her hand came a faint blue glow that lit the room and a small portal opened up in front of them both. Hawksons eyes grew in amazement. He shifted his eyes down and met hers.
"Your a Druid...? Why didn't you say so?" 
"Wanted it to be a surprise." she said jokingly "now go save yourself!" and she shoved him away with tears growing in her eyes. As he stood there he suddenly realized the fight was over and the group clearly lost. The remaining Orcs were regrouping and getting ready to come after him. As he turned to leap through the portal a familiar voice came to him. 
"Leaving already?" asked the voice 
Hawkson flipped around and saw Blake standing there in all his glory and honor. He stood beside several massive Orcs. 
"I figured it out, your group gets wiped out on a rescue mission and you die with the legend of a hero. Or your going to retire with allot of money that isn't yours and nobody ever looks for a dead man. Which one is it?"
"Your a smart one,boy!" Blake snaped "Actually the Emperor wants my services. To the Crushbone Orcs, I'm a noble lord, surpassed by only Crush himself." And as he said that Crush pushed his way to the front and stood next to Blake. "Now I just supply war tactics, information and military knowledge, and sit on my fat duff all day long living the easy life!" And a large grin came over his face.
"It's too bad you don't know the Orcs like I know them." replied Hawkson with a growing grin on his face.
"Why do you say that?"
"In Orc law they don't beleve in treaties and people like you. They beleve in themselfs and Crushbone thats it." Hawkson snapped
"What does that mean?" Blake responded
"Means they will get your information, then kill you. Nobody conspires with Orc's and live to tell about it.Thats the Orc way. Looks like you forgot to do your homework Blake. Don't worry if you try to escape it will be a quick painful death...that is unless they decide to eat you and display your corpse in the mess hall."
A growing fear covered the face of the General and he turned tward Crush who only beamed smile in his direction . A faint smile crossed his face, but it quickly faded away as he looked across to poor Zol's lifeless body and he fought to hold back the tears. His eyes shifted once again to Blake and Crush and a sight of pure hatred crossed his eyes. He moved swiftly removing the claws from his right hand and putting them away. And he rose his hand to Crush and completed his rude gesture and shouted out in elvish: 
"I'll be back for you someday Crush I vow by it!"
"I'll be waiting for you ! And I'll take your life just as I took hers!" he snapped back 
And Hawkson disappeared into the portal.
