  <tr><td class='db'> </td></tr>
  <tr><td class='db'>I received, by way of a letter, word that a friend had fallen in combat in an area known as the Dreadlands.  The Dreadlands are a very treacherous section of the once lost continent of Kunark.  Apparently, many people have druids teleport them to the Dreadlands in order to avoid the long cold rides on the boats.
<p></p>
While I can't say that I blame them for not wanting to journey by way of boat, I also don't envy their run across the Dreadlands.  To me, it is preferable to take the boats, even if it means spending a great deal of time on the ocean.  At least it gives me time to meditate, and study my prayers.
<p></p>
The letter I received of my friend's demise mentioned that he had received a teleport from a friendly druid.  He had lost his life during his journey across the Dreadlands.  A drachnid spider of some sort had ambushed him and being only in his 20th season, he was quickly overcome.  The letter implored me to locate his body and to attempt to resurrect him.
<p></p>
Knowing that I would only be putting him in more danger if I resurrected him where he had fallen, I set out to drag his body back to the tunnels near Firiona Vie.  There he would be safe while he recovered from the effects of resurrection, not to mention have the crossing of the Dreadlands behind him.
<p></p>
I pondered my plan while riding the boat over to Kunark.  I had, in my possession, a potion that would grant me the speed of the wolf.  This item would be a necessity for crossing the vast distance to his corpse and back.  So heavy in thought was I, that I did not even take time to marvel at the elven craftsmanship of the ship that carried its passengers to and from the lost land.
<p></p>
Needing to pick up some more supplies, I stopped by a merchant when the boat finally docked.  I was in need of some more rations.  When I mentioned my journey that I had ahead of me, the merchant reached behind the counter and pulled out a few items, which he thought, might be of assistance.  Two things caught my eye in particular.  A chipped bone rod, which is used for locating corpses, and a couple of bottles of some misty substance.  When I inquired about the bottles he mentioned that they were cloudy potions.  When consumed, they would grant the individual invisibility.  Tunare herself must have placed this merchant here, for both of these items would aid me greatly in my quest.  I purchased two bottles of the potion, and one chipped bone rod.  Feeling the blessing of Tunare, I confidently made my way to the tunnels that lead to the Dreadlands.
<p></p>
Once I reached the other side of the tunnels, I looked out into the barren wasteland of the place I was to travel across.  I did not look forward to the long dangerous trek across such a perilous area.  I quickly consumed the potion that granted me the speed of the wolf, followed by one of the invisibility potions.  I felt my body tingle as it disappeared from view.  Saying a quick prayer to Tunare, I set out in the direction that I was told the corpse would be.
<p></p>
I moved quickly, dodging strange creatures.  Some of the creatures, from my understanding, where able to see through the invisibility, and I took no chances on discovering which ones were able to.
<p></p>
The first portion of my travel took me through a desert area.  Mostly sand, with several ruined buildings dotting the landscape.  Many of the half spider half man creatures lived out here, sharing their land with large Drolvargs.  The Drolvargs are a fierce dog-like race.  In some ways they resemble the gnolls of the old land, however these are much larger and much more powerful.
<p></p>
In a short time, many thanks to my wolf like speed, I reached an area where the desert suddenly stopped, and snow began to fall.  Never in my life have I seen such contrasting landscapes.  Certainly this is the curse of some god that the land is like this.  Unlike the desert area, which was mostly flat and featureless, the arctic section was mountainous.  I was determined to cross this section quickly as well.  In some ways, this area was even more so dangerous than the desert area, as you could not see as far.  One never knew what was on the other side of the hill that was being climbed.  Many times, as I reached the top of the hill, the only thing I could do to get down the other side was slide, and occasionally the slide would turn into a painful tumble.  Still, I persevered.  Knowing that I was reaching the area where the corpse lay, I pulled out my chipped bone rod.  The rod, when activated, would point me in the direction of the corpse.  The catch however, was that if I deviated from the course, even slightly, I could miss the body.  This included navigating around the giants and yetis that traversed the area.
<p></p>
I activated the bone rod, and it pointed me slightly to the right.  “Good”, I thought.  “At least I’m going the right way.”  I resumed my running, sliding and tumbling.  When I crested a certain hill, I saw before me a huge fort.  Presumably where the giants lived.  I was forced to deviate from the course that the bone rod had put me on.  I could only pray that the bone rod was able to put me back on course later.  As I skirted around the fort, I kept a sharp eye out for any giants that might be lurking around.  I saw none, and relaxed for a moment.  I quickly rounded the fort, and then climbed up the hill on the opposing side.  Standing, at the top of the hill, I once again activated the bone rod.  I apparently had not deviated too much from my course, as it only turned me slightly once again.  “Tunare’s hand must be upon me”, I thought.  I crossed over a few more hills, and finally in the distance, could barely see the corpse lying on the ground.  Having been there for a few days, it was covered in snow, and difficult to make out.
<p></p>
By the time I reached the body of my fallen friend, I was rather fatigued.  I sat down for a few moments to collect my thoughts.  Feeling a hunger pang, I pulled out a ration and began chewing.  Not the best of food, but it was sustenance, and I had become accustomed to eating things of questionable nature.  Still I longed for the meals that the lovely elf maidens cooked back home in Felwithe.  I made it a point to visit some friends and enjoy a meal and some fine elven wine when I got home.
<p></p>
I finished the ration, and stood up to stretch my legs.  Weather like this was not something that I was accustomed to, and the cold wet snow caused my feet to ache.  Determined not to let the weather get to me, I began pulling my friend’s body back to the tunnels.  I made quick time through the snow.  Not having to worry about following a straight course allowed me more freedom to cut between the hills that I had been forced to climb previously.  I quickly reached the point where the desert began and the snow ended.
<p></p>
At this time I consumed the last invisibility potion in my possession.  Using the bone rod had dispelled the effects of invisibility on my journey to the body, and I decided that it would be prudent to cross the flat terrain invisible, as I didn’t have the hills and the snow to hide me through the desert.
<p></p>
I quickly made my way through the desert land, retracing the steps that had led me through there before.  Many of the landmarks looked familiar, which aided in my return.  As I was studying the landscape, attempting to gauge which direction to take, I felt a shadow creep up on me.  I spun around.  A drolvarg!  He hit me.  I reeled in pain, as he struck me a second time.  Apparently, this was one of the creatures that could see through my invisibility.  I quickly gained a handle on the situation, and spotted trees off to my right.  At the speed of the wolf, I ran towards the tree line.  Just before approaching it, I turned to see that the drovlarg was still giving chase; only he had gained the aid of another drovlarg.  Panicked, I ran into the forest, hoping to evade them there.  My elven training came through for me, as I quickly lost my pursuers in the forest.  I sat for a moment, whispering a short prayer of thanks to Tunare. 
<p></p>
After a moment, I made my way out of the forest area, back into the desert.  A quick glance around indicated that I had indeed succeeded in losing my pursuers.  Regaining my bearings, I traveled on towards the tunnels.
<p></p>
When I finally reached the tunnels, I sat down to regain my strength.  The journey had been long and tiresome, but it was not quit finished yet.  I still had to find the strength to bring my friend back from the dead.  I opened up my prayer book, and located the necessary prayer.  I slowly recited the words of ancient prayer of resuscitation.  I sat back down and watched the corpse for any signs of life.  Silently praying that Tunare would grant this young lad his life.  For long moments, nothing happened.  Suddenly, the eyes opened.  I kneeled in a prayer of thanks, and began to pray a healing prayer.  Strength returned to his body as he sat to rest.
