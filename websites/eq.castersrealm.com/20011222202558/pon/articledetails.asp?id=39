<td width='80%'><p>Hail fellow Paladins,<br>
          <br>
          I have written a large guide to the Estate of Unrest for you all to
          read and use. I have submitted it to EQ Lizer but they don't seem to
          want to post it yet. I wish to share my knowledge and experience with
          you all to help all those high teens to high twenties paladins who
          don't want to die horribly in Unrest as many of us have in the past.
          Read and enjoy.</p>
          <p>Scribed by an old Unrest veteran, Mcanallen Foehammer of Sanctus
          Covenir, Povar Server<br>
          <br>
          Hello fellow Norrathians! It is good to see you reading this
          invaluable guide to one of the best designed and downright spookiest
          dungeons of Norrath. I am an old dog of Unrest, as any paladin should
          be. I came at level 16, fresh from practicing my new Ward Undead spell
          in Steamfont for countless of hours to knock off some skeleton heads
          and maybe make some cash. I left at level 30, sporting a massive
          collection of knowledge of the zone’s bestiary, loot, and layout.
          This guide will serve as light in a very dark tunnel when you are
          hunting around in the basement hoping a werebat won’t be around and
          see through your Invisible VS Undead. However, if you are foolish and
          unwise in the ways of basic arts such as pulling, ‘/assist’ing,
          and of course, running for your life, then consider yourself dead and
          out of half a bubble of hard earned experience.<br>
          <br>
          The guide is in four parts: part one is a general introduction; part
          two is a guide to the various rooms and common spawn areas; part three
          is a breakdown of the loot of things both mundane and rare; part four
          is a collection of all of Unrest’s monsters, ranging from annoying
          Death Beetles to a cantankerous old dwarven ghost by the name of
          Garanel Rucksif.</p>
<hr size="1">
          <p><strong>Part One: General Introduction</strong><br>
          <br>
          The old mansion of Unrest can be accessed via Dagnor’s Cauldron.
          When zoning in from the Butcherblock mountains, simply follow the lake
          coast to the right hand side. Along the way you will pass an NPC camp
          of assorted races and later on, a camp of aqua goblins. Players 15-20
          can actually hunt the goblins here, as they sometimes drop bronze
          weapons and a few plat. Right past the goblin camp is a big slash in
          the cliff wall to the right again: this is where the fun begins. Try
          not to step all over the people healing/medding after being kicked out
          by a huge train, and enter if ye dare!<br>
          <br>
          The first thing you see is a long tunnel. This is where half of the
          deaths occur, since ALL trains will come down here. If you happen to
          be in the tunnel when a train comes, you might consider doing an
          about-face and making a run for the zone. The tunnel gives way to an
          outdoor area. You will first see a pair of stone fountains, and behind
          it, two hedge mazes. Come closer and you will see the mansion itself,
          ominous flags waving in the background. Around the mansion is a large
          stone wall that marks then end of the zone, with about 100 paces of
          ground in between the wall and the house. Dare approach the double
          doors, brave adventurer?<br>
          <br>
          The most dangerous aspect of Unrest is by far, the trains. They happen
          often, and they aren’t pretty. At peak hours, the trains stop since
          near every spawn point is being camped or constantly pulled from,
          therefore eliminating the threat. Note that peak occupancy is around
          60-70 people. If you aren’t in a well entrenched group by then, you
          aren’t going to have a profitable night since EVERYTHING will be
          camped. Around 40 people is about ideal, as most of the rooms are
          camped, leaving the hallways and other places untouched, perfect
          hunting grounds for a group on the left wall. Remember, being caught
          in a train is no fun. If you are near the zone, either run for
          Dagnor’s, run for the wall, or invis yourself somehow.<br>
          <br>
          At odd times you will occasionally see people pulling to the aboved
          named fountains. This at first appears to be a good idea since they
          are near the zone. Wrong my friends. This is death alley since EVERY
          train will come rolling through here with a full head of steam and
          just drooling to jump on anyone who happens to be sitting near by.
          Save yourself some trouble and simply move your group to areas not
          near the front of the zone. You will have a much higher chance of not
          getting mobbed by an angry train.<br>
          <br>
          Most importantly, don’t be inconsiderate and idiotic by making
          careless pulls. If there is one thing people hate more than being
          trained, its being trained by a person who does it time and again
          without never learning anything from his/her mistakes. Careful pulls
          are made by assessing the number of monsters in the room or hall you
          are about to grab from. If you see more than three do not pull. You
          will create a train because more oft than nought, there are quite a
          few other monsters very near by that are behind walls or doors. When
          you pull the three you see, the other eight you didn’t see will
          follow the others and chop you in two. However, if you see three
          monsters and you know the areas around are camped, then you can safely
          pull without picking up anything else. Pulling in Unrest quickly
          becomes a fine art. You had best learn to be a Michelangelo if you
          want to last long.<br>
          <br>
          As another note, Unrest is an outdoor dungeon. This allows druids,
          shamans, and bards to use spells like Spirit of Wolf and Selo’s
          Accelerando. Druids will also be delighted as they can use their
          outdoor-only lightning-based nuke spells. Unrest tends to be
          druid-heavy as few other dungeons with this level range are outdoor.
          Remember, there are two types of people in Unrest: the quick and the
          dead.</p>
<hr size="1">
          <p><strong>Part Two: The Rooms and Locations of Unrest</strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong><u>Levels 12-16</u></strong><br>
          <br>
          The place where many lowbie characters get their first taste of Unrest
          is around the mansion itself.<br>
          There are numerous areas that a group around 13-15 can do well in, or
          even solo for some. Level 12 is a might dangerous, as that is the
          lowest level of any of the beasts here. 16 can be high, since you can
          be in a group pulling from the 1st floor by now easily.<br>
          <br>
          The first place are the two hedge mazes right behind the fountains.
          They are rather small, so don’t worry too much if you get lost:
          there isn’t much to get lost in. In here you will find tormented
          dead, jack o lanterns, and greater skeletons, with the normal death
          beetles roaming around as usual.<br>
          <br>
          The gazebo: this area can be accessed if you take an immediate right
          after you pass the fountains.<br>
          After a quick trip around the hedge maze, you will see a moderately
          sized ground area, upon which many beetles, TD, and skeletons roam.
          There is a structure right on the wall that sports some spawn points,
          a place commonly referred to as the gazebo. It is relatively out of
          the way of trains, but beware, the monsters are close together, so
          make sure you don’t bite off more than you can chew.<br>
          <br>
          The back area: this is at the opposite end of Unrest from where you
          zone in. Here you will find a back entrance to the house that leads
          into a fairly tough room, meant for levels 16-20ish. However, numerous
          beetles, TD, skeletons, and jacks roam around, but in more spread out
          numbers than the gazebo area. Again, same level range as the gazebo,
          minus the risk of having to pull them all at once. However, beware the
          group that will undoubtedly be right next to you that is pulling from
          the house. Ghouls, mummy’s , and the odd dry bone skeletons will be
          coming out of there, and if the other group runs, their train will
          come back and kill you very quickly.<br>
          <br>
          <u>
          <strong>Levels 17-22</strong><br>
          </u>
          <br>
          By now, your group will be perched on what is called ‘the left
          wall’. To reach the wall, simply take a left at the fountains and
          you will see a long wall with a few groups camped out there. It is the
          main reference point in the zone and the main area that groups pull
          from. You can often find higher level groups perched here, as they
          will have a puller run into the deeper areas of the house to search
          for spawns that groups inside the house might have missed. You will
          likely begin pulling from the 1st floor to the left wall in groups at
          a level range of 16-23. 2nd floor groups range from 22-28. Groups
          trying to camp either the tower or basement areas may be here, trying
          to clear out the grouped spawns. These high level groups range from
          25-35.<br>
          <br>
          The first floor: Inside the first floor you will find ghouls, lurking
          mummy’s, dark boned skeletons, and sometimes dry bone skeletons. The
          area is constantly pulled from by groups on the wall, and this area
          also gives birth to 40% of the trains here because people who are
          inexperienced at pulling can easily create a 10 monster death wagon.
          The best level range to hunt in here is between 16-22. However, most
          people at level 22 are in 2nd floor groups and only receive exp on
          mummy’s or the odd high level ghoul or dark bone. The area is fairly
          high risk since many of the undead are tightly packed, resulting in
          multi-monster pulls.<br>
          <br>
          The mummy room: this area is found towards the back of the house that
          is just under the tower. The room is circular and has four spawn
          points within. Ghouls, mummy’s, dark bones, and a rare dry bone
          spawn here, providing excellent loot and exp for a group situated
          there. Groups can also pull from other 1st floor areas or even the
          beginning of the 2nd floor if they feel adventurous. Keep in mind that
          a lot of 2nd floor/tower trains run through here, so be prepared to
          zone or deal with some really mean backwash once the train returns.
          2nd floor pullers also like to pull through the mummy room by taking
          the undead out the nearby door as opposed to the porch.<br>
          <br>
          <strong><u>Levels 22-28</u></strong><br>
          <br>
          The 2nd floor: after you get sick rotten of killing ghouls and
          mummy’s, you can now step up to killing undead between levels 21-27.
          The 2nd floor is a devious place indeed, as the undead are packed even
          tighter in than the 1st floor. A single monster sitting in the hallway
          when you first walk up the staircase can bring 10 of its friends with
          it when you pull it easily. You can easily bring the wrath of the
          hand, magi, tower, and bar rooms down on you with a single misstep.
          That’s a total of over 20 undead, and one dead player of course.<br>
          <br>
          The magi room: this room is great camping for low twenties groups. The
          spawn rate seems fairly slow, allowing a weaker group to recover more
          from a fight before the next one commences. While this is simply
          caused by a small number of spawns, it quickly becomes VERY boring
          sitting around waiting for monsters to appear. There are four total
          spawn points in the room, one of which is above on the staircase where
          the ghoul magi himself spawns. There are some problems with the room
          because a 2nd floor train that bypasses the magi room has a decent
          chance of running right for you once it returns to the house,
          resulting in many of the deaths that occur in this room. Dry bones,
          CG’s, monks, barbed’s, and werebats spawn in the room. The loot is
          also fairly good since you can get dusty bloodstained gloves and sell
          them for a sizeable sum to a rabid INT caster. The ghoul magi spawn is
          on about 20 minutes, and a placeholder appears about 2/3rds of the
          time. Many groups in the magi room will often pull from the
          surrounding halls since a mid twenties group will get very bored after
          clearing the room out.<br>
          <br>
          Camping the magi room can become a very tricky ordeal due to some
          irregularities with pathing. 3 critters spawn in magi room on the
          floor and the magi on balcony. Campers beware that right outside the
          room is a closet where a single monster spawns. The spawn outside in
          the closet is linked to the spawn point closest to the interior wall.
          This means that if you barge in to the magi room, the closet spawn
          will come too. This closet spawn will pull the other 2 fireplace
          spawns and quite possibly the entire hand room (around 10 more
          playmates for you). If you are extremely unlucky or you happen to
          actually fight on the balcony (this can happen when you battle the
          magi) you can even pull the barkeep room, with the attached tower
          room, down on your head. This room has the smallest number of spawns
          actually in it sans the tower but it is one of the most difficult to
          hold properly. You MUST keep the spawns killed down in order after
          you've managed to break this room.</p>
          <p>
          The hand room: a fantastic room for mid twenties characters. While the
          loot consists only of FS and a fairly unimpressive Ivory Bracelet, the
          exp is not to be believed. Nearly TEN monsters spawn in this room!!
          The vast numbers of constantly spawning monsters makes for fast,
          furious, and a fun time had by all. The hand himself isn’t much of a
          challenge, but he is a wizard and thus can quickly kill off an
          individual who doesn’t pay attention or who has an idiot for a
          healer. The escape route out of the hand room is much more preferable
          to any other room in the house. There is a door that leads to an
          outside patio. Once outside, simply jump off the railing on to the
          roof and on to the ground for a minimally damaging fall. You will land
          right ahead of the first set of double doors and near the hedge mazes.
          The zone is only a quick scamper away and the monsters tend to take
          the long way out, buying you time to zone. This is a must-camp for
          groups who can survive. Monsters spawning here are the same as the
          magi room, with the reanimated hand spawning in the rug in the corner.
          A placeholder appears about 2/3rds the time.<br>
          <br>
          The locations of the hand room spawns require a campers attention. The
          room consists of three parts: a waiting room, a little library, and a
          patio right outside. Three monsters spawn in the waiting room. Four
          monsters spawn in the library room (the hand included). A single
          monster will spawn right near the patio door. Keep in mind that your
          group will be sitting in the library awaiting the hand. You may not
          notice spawns appearing in the waiting room, as they will not jump on
          you if you are sitting in the library. If a monster appears in the
          library and your party jumps on it, you can quickly have the three
          spawns you forgot about on your head in an instant. It is a common
          practice to have a single party member stay in the waiting room so
          that the spawns can be staggered more, thus preventing further loss of
          life.<br>
          <br>
          While not related directly to any room in particular, it should be
          noted that there is a good chance that a monster spotted in the
          hallway of the 2nd floor is linked to the hand room or bar room. If
          these rooms are uncamped and you pull from the hall, you will most
          likely pull out these other rooms and anything linked to them
          unwittingly. Ever seen raw death on a railroad? When you spot the
          whole of the tower, hand, bar, and magi rooms storming at you, you had
          better start praying for a miracle. Remember people, SCOUT YOUR
          PULLS!!! Make sure that the pull you will make will not result in
          hordes of monsters spewing out of the house.<br>
          <br>
          The bar room: another great camp for a mid twenties party. Beware,
          because it is directly linked to the tower above that has MUCH meaner
          monsters. It is usually necessary for both a bar and tower group to be
          present. While higher level tower groups can usually take on both at
          the same time, a mid twenties bar group cannot hold both rooms
          consistently. Inside the room there are around 8 spawn points, each
          with a dry bone, CG, monk, barbed, werebat, unrest noble, or undead
          barkeep present. This makes for a dangerous room. If you must zone,
          you will likely drag the denizens of the magi room out with you if the
          magi room isn’t camped. Despite this danger that the magi room and
          tower can unexpectedly come after you, it is a great place to pick up
          levels and some decent cash.<br>
          <br>
          The tower: this is a very slow camp that a mid twenties group could
          possibly do if the bar room beneath is camped as well. There are a
          grand total of THREE spawn points here, all on an 18 minute timer. The
          slow spawn rate can turn a lively group into a bored one rapidly. If
          the tower group is camping the bar as well, it isn’t near as boring
          since there is a fairly constant stream of mid twenties undead running
          up the stairs to hit you. However, the monsters in the tower are much
          tougher (high twenties) than the other 2nd floor rooms. In here,
          barbed bones, monks, werebats, festering hags (WARNING: very
          dangerous!) and greater dark bones spawn. The central spawn point is
          where the undead knight of Unrest spawns. He is the reason groups camp
          here. An individual can pick up a tunic worth 400 pp if they are
          having a lucky day.<br>
          <br>
          <strong><u>Levels 26-35</u></strong><br>
          <br>
          The basement found by clicking on a bookcase on the first floor
          reveals the most dangerous and by far most fun part of the dungeon.
          Here you will never see creatures weaker than skeletal monks, giving a
          high twenties group plentiful exp. The first feature of the basement
          you will notice when you click on the bookcase is a short set of
          stairs that lead down to two monsters sitting pretty there. This
          little corner is camped by groups either desperate for exp when the
          zone is crowded or by groups trying to clear out the basement pit to
          move deeper in.<br>
          <br>
          The pit: welcome to hell. In here, you will see torture devices and
          spikes sporting bloody human heads around. You will also find skeletal
          monks, barbed bones, werebats, hags, and greater dark bones. There are
          nearly 9 spawn points here, making for a very hard room to hold on to.
          If it is fully spawned and a group is trying to clear it out, a ranger
          or druid with the harmony spell to pull only a few monsters at a time
          is essential. Once the spawn rate gets spread out, a group can sit
          here for hours just soaking up all the exp. You don’t get trained
          all that much, as only the blood pool and the ghost room (which are
          usually easy to manage) are past the pit. If you are lucky, a lesser
          blade fiend will spawn which will give your finances a respectable
          kick if you win the random loot. You can also find a dusty werebat who
          carries a quest item for those who need it. As another note, there is
          a hidden wall that the 2nd set of stairs leads up to. You can just
          walk right through it, leading you to the blood pool.<br>
          <br>
          The blood pool: just past the pit is a hallway that gives way to a pit
          of bubbling red goo. It looks harmful, but you can swim in it as you
          please without any harm to yourself. Beware, there are two pits to the
          left and right of the pool that are covered by illusionary floor. You
          will fall down and take minimal falling damage and getting up is as
          simple as walking up the ladder there, so there isn’t a huge
          concern. However beware the single monster that spawns in the bottom
          of each pit. It tends to be a fungi, much to the dislike of the
          party's tanks. A group can camp here and do fairly well. By the pool
          itself there are two spawn points and there are a few others in the
          hall that leads back to the pit. Beware the mortuary fungus that
          appear, as its spell will slow your attack speed to a crawl. Like the
          pit, skeletal monks, barbed bones, werebats, festering hags, and
          greater dark bones spawn in here. The blood pool is usually camped by
          a group when Unrest gets crowded and both the ghost and pit are
          camped, leaving the blood pool and tower (but people trying to level
          quickly loathe the tower due to the turtle-ish spawn rate)<br>
          <br>
          The ghost pit: here is where it gets really fun. This pit is beneath
          the slender bridge that connects you to the ghost room. In here you
          will encounter terrors, living hell fiends that look and sound
          disgusting. A high twenties/low-thirties group can stake out here if
          the ghost above is camped. A ghost group will usually let you have the
          pit as they just want the boots and don’t care too much about the
          exp. Here barbeds, GDB’s, hags, mort fungi, and terrors spawn.<br>
          <br>
          The ghost room: danger, zombies and pale ghosts, oh my! This is the
          final step in the Unrest experience. While there are only three or so
          spawn points, (not including the pit below that a ghost group will
          almost always be pulling from at the same time) the cranky dwarven
          ghost Garanel Rucksif spawns towards the right hand corner of the
          room. His placeholder is a hag, and she can appear five times in a row
          before Garanel himself shows his head. This is where Jagged Bands and
          Dwarven Work Boots are found, incentives which occasionally place high
          level casters who are broke, bored, or both down here to camp/kill
          steal for the boots. Overall, this is the most sought after place for
          a high twenties/low thirties groups to camp. People regularly come
          down and ask you to put them on a list so they can join if someone in
          the ghost party leaves. As a final note, the ghost himself is as tough
          as a hill giant and therefore hits hard and can take quite a beating.
          Players in their high 20's and below will commonly find that he fully
          resists your spells (I despise the 6 level resist limit. For those of
          you who do not know, it is nearly impossible for you to successfully
          cast offensive spells against creatures 6 levels higher than you). It
          is best to hose him down as fast as you can before the tanks get too
          beat up. Even clerics should invest some mana in chain-casting Dismiss
          Undead.</p>
<hr size="1">
          <p><strong>Part Three: Loot Breakdown</strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong>Fine steel weapons</strong> are found on the following
          creatures: a dry bone skeleton, a carrion ghoul, a barbed bone
          skeleton, Reclusive Ghoul Magi, a zombie of Unrest noble, an undead
          barkeep, a festering hag, a greater dark bone, an undead knight of
          Unrest, Mortuary Fungus<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Small ringmail armor</strong> can be found on some of the
          middle-of-the road creatures here. The stuff is fairly worthless as
          very few people consider buying it, as banded chainmail is lighter and
          has greater AC. Consider it vendor food, as it sells for a few pp per
          piece. It is rarely found on the following creatures: a ghoul, a
          lurking mummy, a carrion ghoul, dark boned skeleton.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Small bronze platemail armor</strong> can be found here. It is
          about 20% heavier than store bought platemail of the same size and has
          the exact same AC. The other difference is that bronze looks a lot
          cheaper and tackier than steel . As of now, bronze is as common as
          rusty weapons and therefore sells for very little money. The banded
          armor economy took a severe hit as the price on bronze kept going
          lower and lower as it’s availability increased. It is sometimes
          found on the following creatures: a dry bone skeleton, a barbed bone
          skeleton, a greater dark bone, an undead knight of Unrest.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Savants Cap</strong> (stats are AC 2, +3 WIS and +3 INT)
          [ALL/ALL] this low level caster item is found on the Reclusive Ghoul
          Magi and sells for something between 20-40 pp.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Dusty Bloodstained Gloves</strong> (stats AC 2, +25 mana)
          [WIZ, NEC, MAG, ENC] A fair caster item that many use until they get
          Impskin gloves. A friend of mine sold a pair for 200pp, while I sold
          the lone pair I found for 80 pp. This item is rarely looted off of the
          Reclusive Ghoul Magi.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Ivory Bracelet</strong> (stats +3 AGI, +20 mana) [ALL/ALL]
          another lower level caster item. While I don’t have a set price on
          the top of my head, I recall selling one for 35 pp, but prices may
          range from as low as 20 pp to as high as 80. It is rarely looted off
          of a reanimated hand.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Gladius</strong> (stats 1H slashing, 7 damage 29 delay) this
          is a irregular drop off of the lesser blade fiend. I doubt there are
          many people out there using one, not only because of its rarity, but
          because slightly better items can be found at a lesser expense of both
          time and money (hint: barbed leather whip). Many wield it just for
          bragging rights.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Pugius Dagger</strong> (stats Piercing, 5 damage, 21 delay) a
          more common drop off of the lesser blade fiend. Like Gladius, it
          isn’t worth that much effort to go camping for since dragoon dirks
          are highly superior. It is useable by casters, but they would prefer a
          dirk for the + magic resist.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Thick Leather Apron </strong>(stats 8 ac, weight 1.0) [WAR,
          PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, DRU, SHM, MNK, ROG, BRD] the apron is one of the
          most preferred waist slot items for mid level players. The AC is
          higher than plate and has a much, much lower weight. Any class who can
          wear leather items, including monks and druids, can wear this, making
          for a near perfect piece of general purpose armor. It is found on an
          undead barkeep regularly. Standard market price is 20-30 pp.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Opaline Earring</strong> (stats AC 2, +5 CHA, ALL/ALL) an
          enchanters dream earring. They fall all over themselves for that
          little extra bit of charisma. I carry one around with me for making
          vendor runs, which just adds a copper or two to my finances. It is
          found irregularly off of an undead barkeep.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Bloodstained Mantle</strong> (stats AC 6, +3 STR, +10 SV
          MAGIC) [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, SHM, ROG, BRD] an excellent item for
          melee classes. The AC is decent and the extra MR is fantastic. I had a
          hard time letting go of mine (I replaced them with Adamantine Epolets
          for the extra AC and wisdom for additional chain-healing) I would
          strongly recommend this item for people in their late teens and high
          twenties until they get something like crested spaulders, carnal
          pauldrons, or the epolets. It is commonly dropped off the undead
          knight of Unrest and sells for 40-50 pp (in the old days they went for
          double that, which my bank account didn’t mind in the least )<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Bloodstained Tunic</strong> (stats AC 13, +4 AGI, +4 WIS)
          [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, SHM, ROG, BRD] this is one of the most
          sought after items for shamans and clerics. I sometimes find paladins
          and rangers wearing it if they obsess about casting. I am a worshiper
          of AC, so I shunned it for standard bronze plate. The only reason a
          melee class should consider wearing it is if they are below the 75 AGI
          mark (if your AGI is below 75, you take a massive AC hit. For me it is
          in excess of 50 points). There are those out there who wear equipment
          sheerly for looks, and the BS tunic has a distinctive red tint that
          looks pretty cool. It is rarely dropped off the undead knight of
          Unrest and sells in excess of 400 pp.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Jagged Band</strong> (stats AC 5, +3 STR) [ALL/ALL] this is an
          extremely sought after melee item. Since it is a ring, you can wear
          two of them and get a fair AC boost off of them. The extra STR works
          great for carrying around more loot (stats are meaningless for the
          most part after Verant tells us that AGI doesn’t affect
          dodge/parry/riposte and that DEX doesn’t affect duel wield or double
          attack). While I will have trouble letting go of my plat fire emerald
          ring (+5 STR, +5 DEX) to repurchase a new set of bands, I am sure that
          it will be justified when monsters suddenly can’t connect a hit on
          me anymore. They are commonly found off of Garanel Rucksif deep in the
          Unrest basement, which usually causes DWB campers to vex in anger and
          sell the band for dirt cheap. Common price is 50 pp.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Dwarven Work Boots</strong> (stats AC 8, +3 STR, +5 DEX) [WAR,
          PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, DRU, SHM, MNK, ROG, BRD] this is one of the most
          highly sought after melee items for mid to high levels. They carry the
          most value of any item found in Unrest. While the introduction of
          class specific armor lead many to drop their DWB’s, they still are
          highly sought after and still very expensive or trade only. I
          personally will take the 11 ac on Boots of Ro over the slight
          statistical bonus on the DWB simply because I believe strongly in AC.
          Still, many druids and monks who can’t get anything nearly as high
          in AC or stats for that matter will gladly buy a pair from you. The
          boots are rarely dropped off the dwarven ghost Garanel Rucksif and the
          price range goes from 1500 to 3000 pp, or even trade only!<br>

          <p>
          <strong>Part Four: The Bestiary</strong><br>
          <br>
          <b><u>
          Common monsters</u></b><br>
          <br>
          <strong>Death Beetle</strong> (12-15): you can hear them coming a
          mile away: the mindless &lt;clack clack clack&gt; quickly becomes an
          earsore. They are commonly hunted by groups levels 12-16, and are most
          often no more than nuisances to wall groups who are pulling much
          bigger game out now. They will not attack you unless you attack any
          undead. They don’t drop anything (including money) other than scarab
          eggs, cracked giant scarab carapaces, and very rarely, pristine scarab
          carapaces.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Tormented Dead </strong>(13-17): coming in both male and
          female versions, these creepy zombies are often fodder for gazebo or
          back wall groups. They have a low-middle aggro radius and will charge
          you until you are around level 20. They often bear rusty weapons and
          even shields. They also drop zombie skin, a component used in a few
          quests. Rarer still, they carry bronze weapons that are excellent to
          sell for characters hunting them. Common cash loot ranges up to
          several gold. They are commonly referred to as TD for obvious reasons.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Greater Skeleton</strong> (13-17): the weakest skeletons of
          Unrest who are usually just bony headaches that must be dealt with.
          They spawn everywhere around the house and are hunted by gazebo and
          wall groups. They have the same loot as TD, except they drop bone
          chips instead of zombie skin for obvious reasons.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Jack o Lantern</strong> (13-17): you will quickly grow to
          hate these pumpkin-crowned hedge-dwellers, not only for their maniacal
          laugh (much more grating on your ears than the skeletons) but a spell
          they randomly cast in battle called ScarecrowFear. It is a stunning
          spell that lasts around 5 seconds that is easily resisted. Beware, you
          won’t see them cast, as it goes off randomly much like weapons with
          a random process effect. They drop plentiful gold and rusty weapons,
          but are not nearly as common as TD or greater skeletons. Commonly
          referred to as jacks.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Ghoul</strong> (15-19): these critters are only found in the
          mansion. High teens groups like to pull them out of the house, as they
          are the primary first floor residents. Excellent exp and loot for
          their level. Beware, they have a VERY nasty effect they use on you,
          the dreaded GhoulRoot. One moment you are fighting a ghoul, when pop,
          you can’t move. Once you see the message ‘Your legs feel weak’
          you are now rooted for about 30 seconds unless your magic resist
          prevails and you break it earlier. Very deadly in a train situation,
          as you can’t run while all the undead bash you into the dust. In
          terms of loot they are worth killing, as they sometimes drop rusty
          weapons and even bronze weapons. Rarer yet off them is small ringmail
          armor, armor with the same AC as store bought chainmail, but more
          weight and less AC than player-made banded armor. Though you might get
          worked up at first, it is usually vendor food as no players with
          banded mail will so much as look at your ringmail.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Dark Boned Skeleton</strong> (15-19): For some reason, these
          dark colored skeletons like to attack you regardless of level, or so
          it seems. They are the same level as ghouls and drop highly similar
          loot. They are less dangerous since they do not root you, but I have
          noticed that they tend to hit a bit harder. They are found on the 1st
          floor of the mansion and are slightly more common than mummy’s.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Lurking Mummy</strong>( 18-21): again, these towering beasts
          are found in the mansion only. They hit hard and they like to disease
          you. If you get rabies off them, it isn’t a huge deal. It will only
          cut your natural regeneration rate in half, but it will last an entire
          day. Bring a cleric or similar priest class to cure you once you have
          finished fighting a mummy. They drop rusty and bronze weapons, small
          ringmail armor, and strange items that sell for a few plat called
          silver amulets (as far as I know they are nothing but vendor food).
          Great for high teens groups to kill en masse, but they are less common
          than ghouls.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Dry Bone Skeleton</strong> (20-24): welcome to your first
          2nd floor monster. Though you may RARELY see a level 20 dry bone spawn
          on the 1st floor, other than this they are seen only on the 2nd floor.
          They are mean skeletons who hit hard and pack sweet loot to boot. If
          you ever see the text, ‘You feel your skin smoulder’, that means a
          dry bone is chasing you. The effect is called DryBoneFireBurst and it
          does around 25 damage more or less depending on your fire resist. They
          cast it every 15 seconds or so and you can see them cast, allowing you
          to get a kick, slam, or bash in before it hits. Don’t try casting a
          stun spell to interrupt them as it only takes them half a second or so
          to get off. Their availability is tied with carrion ghouls, but the
          carrions tend to be more deadly. The loot off of dry bones are fine
          steel weapons (no rusty or bronze at all) and the excellent small
          bronze armor. Expect the loot of these guys to make a large amount of
          money for high teens-low twenties characters.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Carrion Ghoul</strong> (21-24): enter the big brother of all
          those little ghouls running around. Like their smaller, weaker
          counterparts, they randomly throw GhoulRoot on you which is a primary
          cause of death for many players. When your party is trying to run and
          you have been rooted, expect to die unless you are a paladin and can
          Lay hands to buy yourself time for the root to break ( I have
          prevented many a death on myself and others when I or a party member
          was rooted). They hit slightly harder than dry bones and are a bit
          tougher as well. Loot consists of fine steel weapons and small
          ringmail. As an important notice to shamans, they randomly drop an
          item called ghoul carrion (no drop), a piece of the totemic armor
          quests. They are commonly called CG’s.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Skeletal Monk</strong> (23-26): ooh I hate these guys, real
          real bad. As their name suggests they are monks, giving them the
          ability to block attacks and use a special strike move. They are hard
          to hit and hit like bricks in return. Even if you are connecting on
          them, you notice they have quite a few hit points, which makes for a
          very unpleasant fight. You will hate them even more because they NEVER
          drop any kind of weapon, only a variety of bone chips and some
          coppers. Unlike CG’s or dry bones, they will spawn in any 2nd floor
          area, many basement areas, and the tower, making them common kills for
          twenty-somethings. Beware them, they are frequent killers. Whether the
          haste effect that was recently implemented to monks gives these guys
          an extra speed zap, I am not sure of.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Barbed Bone Skeleton</strong> (24-27): you dislike monks?
          Then get ready to absolutely loathe and despise barbed bones. To begin
          with, they hit like Mack trucks on a runaway ramp and have a personal
          damage shield that can become a death certificate for a ranger or
          rogue duel wielding fast delay weapons. Their spawning locale’s are
          the same as skeletal monks. As for loot, they never ever carry money
          of any sort. They have fine steel weapons sometimes and strangely
          enough, they drop small bronze at a much lower rate than dry bones.
          They rarely drop bone barbs (keep in mind they are no drop) for use in
          a quest that I do not know about.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Werebat</strong> (24-28): Oh how I hate these disgusting
          vermin! They are NOT undead unlike 90% of the other residents of the
          estate, rendering your fancy invis to undead useless. A common problem
          is when a puller invisible to undead makes for the 2nd floor and walks
          in to a room of undead. He decides not to pull as the numbers would
          overwhelm him and decides to check elsewhere. However, he didn’t
          spot the werebat that was in the room who could see right through that
          invis...<br>
          <br>
          Mcanallen shouts “Bar room to zone, run run run this is a big
          one!”<br>
          <br>
          Not only do werebats see through deceptions against the undead, but
          they have a built in Spirit of Wolf effect that makes fleeing fairly
          pointless unless you happen to have SOW on yourself. They hit hard and
          fast for their level and never drop anything that will make you money.
          They will sometimes drop a werebat wing (note, it is no drop) that may
          be used for the rubicite replacement armor quests.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Zombie of Unrest Noble</strong> (22-25): an upgrade to TD.
          They aren’t especially tough nor do they drop anything special. They
          are only found in the bar room with around 8 of their friends hanging
          around. Their loot is standard fine steel and cash, with odd zombie
          skin dropping.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Greater Dark Bone</strong> (27-29, possibly 30): welcome to
          true pain. You will now experience being smacked across the face for
          65 damage for the first time on a consistent basis. You will only find
          them in the basement and tower areas, as they feel they are too strong
          for hanging around the 2nd floor. They frequently wield fine steel
          weapons and they like to hurt you lots with them. As a trend I have
          noticed, they tend to resist my ward undead more often than not and
          also have a huge mess of hit points. Bringing these guys down is never
          pleasant, but fortunately they don’t cast any sort of spell or put
          those accursed damage shields over themselves like barbed bones. Other
          loot besides FS includes an odd piece of bronze, greater dark bone
          skulls (for use in a quest), and a dark bone bracelet (used in bard
          armor quests). Both the skull and bracelet are no drop. Commonly
          called GDB’s<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Festering Hag</strong> (29-30): Have you ever seen a level
          29 wizard get off three Inferno Shock spells and watched as a monster
          was burned to ash in seconds? Have you ever had the spell cast three
          times on you? If you ever fight hags, you will. They are wizards and
          cast a myriad of offensive spells that will lay you in your grave for
          about 40% of your deaths here. They Inferno Shock you for 237 damage,
          Frost Shock you for 160, Force Shock you for 170, Lightning Shock you
          for 80, etc. etc. ad nauseum... In a multiple player situation, they
          use AoE spells, but believe it or not that is a good thing. If the hag
          hits you all for 50-60 damage with an AoE, she just forfeited the time
          and mana to hit a single character for 240 damage. However, their
          casting power is met with a few hindrances. First of all, they have
          very low hit points, allowing a caster to quickly blast them into
          little zombie chunks. They have a lower AC and don’t hit as often as
          most of the skeletal denizens of the Estate, allowing for quicker
          kills. Don’t think that these disadvantages make them easy, they are
          the most hated and most difficult undead to deal with in the zone. You
          know a hag is around when you are fighting a monster and you are hit
          by a burning damage shield. While this is not a concern (the damage
          shield hits for a pitiful 2 points) it means that a hag is in the
          basement or tower and just caution should be exercised for lower level
          groups if you are pulling near these areas. At high twenties and up,
          they become regular kills and are much less of a pain to deal with.
          Still, it is good to beware them regardless of your level. Standard
          loot is fine steel weapons and even gossamer armor. In addition, they
          drop necromancer only festering cloaks. They also drop globes of mist,
          another quest item. Not surprisingly, the globes are no drop.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Mortuary Fungus</strong> (29-31): another truly loathed beast.
          They are living creatures, destroying the advantage many have against
          only the undead. You can find these creatures only past the pit in the
          basement, in rooms like the ghost room or the pit below. They make for
          such a menace because of a spell they cast every so often called Mort
          Drowsy. Ever had shamans cast walking sleep or Tagar’s insects on
          you? This is worse. The spell turns my BIBS from a 20 damage 47 delay
          weapon to a 20 damage 70 delay weapon or probably even slower. This
          spell renders tanks utterly useless in a fight. Aside from this spell,
          they don’t have exceptional strength or hit points, so a caster can
          take them down without excessive difficulty. They drop fine steel
          weapons some times, but you won’t know they have it as they never
          wield anything. You only find it on its corpse when you loot. Rarely,
          they drop fungus eyes, no drop quest items.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Tentacle Terror</strong> (29-31): for those who have hunted
          in Najena, keep in mind these are much different beasts. Of course,
          they are living creatures, making them immune to undead only spells.
          They cast two spells that are usually just mildly annoying. The first
          one is TerrorLifetap, a lifetap that hits you for 20 damage and
          restores 20 of their hitpoints. Not a huge concern to worry about. The
          second spell is called Throwback, a spell that hurls you a good
          distance unless you strike a wall first. Again, usually just a minor
          nuisance and actually a lifesaver if one is chasing you and you are
          trying to run away. The spell will send you flying away from them,
          which means you don’t have to run as much &lt;grin&gt;. They are
          fairly tough and hit hard in addition to their spells, but in a decent
          party they die very easily. Unlike the Najena terrors, they do not
          drop terror spines or Tentacle whips. Instead, they carry odd gems and
          even beer sometimes. Don’t ask, and I hope Verant doesn’t tell why
          ; )<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Dark Terror</strong> (30-33): again, completely dissimilar
          monsters from the Tentacle terrors of Najena. They are the exact same
          as TT’s here except they are slightly higher level. Same loot, same
          spells, just takes a little more effort to take down.<br>
          <br>
          As a side note about terrors and their Knockback spell is that it can
          be far more dangerous than it seems. While in many cases it will send
          you flying all of three inches backwards against a wall, it can also
          knock you down from a place like the ghost room down into the pit
          below. Now imagine that you haven't cleared it out yet and you are
          trying to get back to the ghost room with two hags nuking you, a fungi
          slowing you, and 2 GDB's beating on you. And to think you have to
          climb a ladder with all that stuff reducing you to a pulp.<br>
          <br>
          <strong><u>Uncommon or Unique Monsters</u></strong>
          <p><strong>A Gnomish Spelunker</strong> (20ish): here is a little gnome
          that spawns in a tiny cavern that is right near the gazebo (notice how
          gnomes are always in the strangest of places...) You must swim to
          access it, and with the gnome a barbed bone, greater dark bone,
          skeletal monk, werebat, or hag will be right next to it. Don’t ask
          me why they don’t have at each other, but they will leave each other
          alone. The gnome is non-aggro to most people, but will come after you
          if you attack the creature next to it. He carries no loot except for
          rusty or bronze weapons.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Reclusive Ghoul Magi</strong> (21-22): a mean necromancer
          ghoul who spawns in the appropriately-titled magi room. If he has
          enough time before being attacked, he will summon up a pet or two. He
          buffs himself with Harmshield and Shieldskin, which usually just annoy
          players rather than really hurt them. His spell arsenal is somewhat
          limited: he casts no lifetaps or poison DOT’s. Instead, he casts
          Heat Blood, Engulfing Darkness (deadly if he casts it on you while
          pulling him to the wall as it slows like snare), Infectious Cloud
          (more of a nuisance than a threat), and a stun spell called Fear2. In
          his room, around four other monsters spawn, usually barbs, dry’s,
          CG’s, monks, and werebats. The magi commonly drops a Savants Cap and
          rarely drops Dusty Bloodstained Gloves.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>A Reanimated Hand </strong>(21-23): this frightful collection
          of fleshy fingers is completely dissimilar from the much tougher
          version in Lower Guk. However, he is a deadly wizard who can get off
          three force shocks very quickly for 170 damage each (fortunately you
          can fully resist the spell half the time). He also has plentiful hit
          points and hits fairly hard and fast as well. He spawns in the
          appropriately titled hand room and is surrounded by nearly 10 other
          monsters! His room is hell to clear out and just about as bad to keep
          clean. His loot isn’t much of a hoot either, since he drops a
          cookbook much of the time. He rarely drops an Ivory Bracelet, an item
          that is fair for casters in their 20's. He is usually camped for the
          awesome exp the room offers.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Undead Barkeep</strong> (mid-twenties): this creature can
          be found behind the bar in the bar room (where else would you find a
          barkeep?). Unrest Nobles, CG’s, dry’s, monks, barbs, and bats are
          all around him, and on top of this the tower just above is linked to
          the bar. In short, you pull the bar and you also pull the tower. The
          barkeep himself is a rogue and usually has a fine steel piercing
          weapon, allowing him to backstab for nearly 100 damage. He commonly
          drops a Thick Leather Apron and rarely drops an Opaline Earring.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Lesser Blade Fiend </strong>(level unknown, probably mid
          twenties): this is a VERY rare spawn, rarer than the priest of Najena.
          He spawns in the basement pit less than once a week at best. He looks
          like a swarming mass of shields and swords, and every time you hit him
          he makes a parrying noise. He is easy to kill, considering where he
          spawns, and he drops either a Pugius dagger or a Gladius sword.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Dusty Werebat</strong> (25-27): he commonly spawns in the
          basement at a specific point in the upper mini-floor towards the back.
          He is just a little tougher than a standard werebat who uncommonly
          drops a pouch of silver dust, a part of a quest.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Priest of Najena</strong> (30): he has one spawn point that
          can be accessed via the 2nd floor. He is a very rare cleric ghoul who
          is linked to the Najena faction. He drops a special no-drop key that
          can be used by casters to complete a quest for a Mystic Cloak.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Undead knight of Unrest</strong> (30): wisdom casters
          rejoice, here comes your great loot. The knight spawns in the tower in
          the central spawn point and is accompanied by hags, bats, monks,
          barbs, and GDB’s. Fortunately, only two other spawn points are in
          this room, so you will never have more than 3 monsters to deal with,
          not including the bar room. The knight is a shadowknight who casts
          harm touch and lifetap spells. He will sometimes summon a pet also. He
          usually drops a piece of small bronze, a fine steel longsword, and a
          Bloodstained Mantle. If you are lucky, he will drop a Bloodstained
          Tunic for you!<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Garanel Rucksif</strong> (35): ahh, the grand finale of my
          bestiary. Old Garanel was probably an old time dwarven miner who just
          had a bad day and was slain here years ago, only to be resurrected as
          a malignant ghost. His room can be accessed deep in the basement over
          the large pit. He is very tough and is around as mean as a sand giant.
          I think he has his own set of polygons and sounds, as I have yet to
          see a creature at all looking or sounding like him. Garanel is the
          toughest creature in Unrest period. He is mean and rotten, so don’t
          think that he won’t butcher you just because you are also a dwarf.
          He hits frequently in the 80's and 90's, allowing him to wade through
          casters like a scythe to corn. A well balanced group 30+ is necessary,
          with a healer being absolutely vital. When you kill him, your reward
          is watching his head disconnect itself from the ethereal body, then
          fall down again after levitating a moment. It is the most hysterical
          animation in EQ that I have seen yet. He always drops a small kite
          shield and a battle axe, the same kinds of things purchased at
          vendors. Other common loot is a Sphere of Unrest (I have no idea what
          it is used for) and a Jagged Band. Rarely he may reward you with a
          pair of Dwarven Work Boots, the most valuable item found in Unrest.<br>
          <br>
          <strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong><br>
          <br>
          What can I say? Unrest makes for one fun night after the next. I have
          met the fewest percentage of jerky and ignorant people here and the
          greatest percentage of knowledgeable and friendly folks here to boot
          (I could mention a few names of some truly evil people I have
          encountered here, but I figure why further ruin their already shoddy
          reputation). Now I remind myself to get out of Cazic Thule and head
          elsewhere, as Cazic has more filthy, obnoxious vermin for players in
          it than a cheap apartment in NYC. Not to mention a paladin’s special
          abilities versus the undead are absolutely useless here (I just got my
          Ghoulbane and seeing the message “This spell only works on the
          undead.”time after time is just downright depressing).<br>
          <br>
          If you are between levels 13 and 34 than this is an ideal place to
          come. You simply cannot equal the amount of loot and exp to be found
          here if you are in a well entrenched group. Keep in mind that 80+
          other people might have the same idea in mind and come down to Unrest,
          creating a massive bottleneck of players pulling in the house and
          camping inside down to the last spawn point. If you are level 25+ and
          Unrest is packed full, you might be able to take your party down to
          Mistmoore (or trainmoore as some call it. Gah I loathe that zone) For
          players 18-22 ish, you can take your group right outside the Unrest
          zone and camp an aqua goblin camp there. The goblins provide excellent
          exp and loot. Just watch out for the shaman's there who like to SOW
          the camp members, making a root/snare spell essential unless you want
          your kill to swim off in the lake and be near impossible to catch.<br>
          <br>
          Be safe fellow adventurers! I hope this guide aids you and many more!
