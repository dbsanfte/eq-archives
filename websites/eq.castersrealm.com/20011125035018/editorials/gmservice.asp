<hr size='1' width='85%'>

  <tr>
<td valign='top' align='left'>
Firstly let me explain that the following editorial is not a simple rant.  I have tried to keep it in its objective context, however a great deal of it does relate specifically to events on the Povar server in which I was involved.  This editorial is aimed to highlight the desperate need for a restructuring of the GM system, and the need for publicized and uniform GM policy.
<P>
It was my sad and unfortunate experience to be involved very recently on an attempt to enter the much-debated zone of the Plane of Fear.  Now in recent times it has become more and more apparent that there are no plans in the very near future to cater to the growing number of high level (level 49+) players on the servers.  The current level 49+ zones of Solusek B and Lower Guk are almost always overflowing beyond their spawn capacity, Kedge Keep still after all this time remains unitemised, and the dragons spawn only once a week.  The fire giant spawn in Solusek B is still problematic with both its AI and pathing, and when the zone isn’t spiking from strange lag bubbles or you can’t see half the people in your group because of zone visibility bugs, your corpse is stuck in some wall while you twiddle your thumbs waiting for a GM to log on 10 minutes after your 2 hour resurrection limit has expired.  In short, there is a desperate need for a high level area.  Before you say “Ahh but the Plane of Hate is coming!” keep in mind it will most likely be as difficult if not more so than the existing Plane of Fear, and the issues I am going to discuss will apply to it equally.
<P>
So with nothing left to do in an already overcrowded environment, a group of 24 seasoned players decided to attempt a Plane of Fear break in.  Now keep in mind that we are not talking newbies here.  Every player has at least 40 days play time.  Every one was level 49 or 50.  Every one knew not only how to play their character but how to play them well.  All that said and done, the break in attempt was disastrous.  After sending in a monk to feign and scout the area we entered the gate en masse.  It is here that the true contentious events of this evening begin to unfold.  <b>Every single player was dumped by the Verant server upon zoning</b>.  I am not saying gradual packet loss resulting in linkdeath – I am referring to an instantaneous dump to the not responding screen.  Every single player died.  If they didn’t die immediately they died as they relogged in one by one into a hostile environment with absolutely no backup.  
<P>
Now lets just make something clear here.  We are talking players from around the world, on different links ranging from modem to t1 and cable.  On computers of varying performance, the majority though high-end (we are hardcore gamers after all) and <b>every single one was dumped alike</b>.  
<P>
We petitioned to the GM’s for assistance in corpse retrieval.  The deaths were caused by either instability with the zone or a latent defect in the code of the game that causes zone dumps when too many people attempt to zone into it at once.  These are problems caused by Verant / Red Eye.  These are the reason (so we would believe) that GM’s are in place.  To assist and facilitate players who suffer loss as a result of fault on the part of game rather than the player.  The players in this instance had no opportunity whatsoever to even defend themselves – these deaths were purely the result of a problem on Verant’s part.
<P>
Of course the guides at first gave us the usual run around.  I am going to deal very quickly with the guides here and now.  Guides are generally players who have a clue about the real game itself.  They donate their time to pull corpses from walls, deal with harassment and exploit reports, and otherwise assist the newbies of Norrath.  The guides generally do a great job and are unpaid for their labours (unlike server GM’s who are employed by Verant).  All of this work by the guides is supposedly meant to assist the lead GM of the server to have more time for dynamic quests and supporting the players in large-scale bug issues such as what occurred with this days Plane of Fear problem.  Povar has had less than 10 dynamic quests since the server went live.  So if this is a reason for the <b>paid employment</b> of server GM’s then its good to know the money is being well spent (not).  On the other hand the response of our server GM Camii to large-scale bug related issues seems to depend on whether or not she got out on the right side of the bed that morning.
<P>
GM Camii eventually logged on to the server in invisible mode.  I messaged her in relation to the issue after the guide so persistently told me that there would be no assistance.  GM Camii first asked what had happened and I explained that the deaths had occurred from zone dumping.  She then said that there would be no help with corpse recovery since there had not been a bug.  I asked how this could not be a bug, she replied that the zone itself had not crashed, the only bug in fear that was known to cause zone failure had been fixed and that was the end of the matter.  I was not going to accept this so I questioned further as to what had caused the problem then.  She replied that the problem was most likely due to too many people trying to zone in at once.  I asked her to direct me to an official Verant publication which gave warning to players that they should not attempt to zone in with more than a specific number of players simultaneously.  She ignored this request, I can only assume it is because there isn’t one.  I then asked why there would not be any assistance again.  She replied that and I quote: <I>“Whilst some server GM’s do assist in corpse recovery for these situations, there are other Servers GM’s that do not.  <b>It is my personal choice not to</b>.”</I>  In other words, “You picked the wrong server to play on because I am not going to give you the equal footing to play on that other servers get”.  I asked her for an email address of someone I could contact at Verant in relation to the poor gm service and she would only give me her own.  I asked to speak directly to the person responsible for the policy she was applying in this instance and she replied: <i>'That would be me.'</i> <P>
Keep in mind also that this same policy had been instituted a few days earlier in Solusek B.  After taking down the zone to supposedly “fix the fire giant spawn” a number of players ended up with their corpses in lava and under numerous giants who had been broken off their path and could not return to their original spawn points.  Once again absolutely no assistance was forthcoming from the Server GM’s and the one guide who attempted to assist us was reprimanded for doing so.  It appears that GM Camii at least believes that she has the personal right to choose the footing on which we the players are permitted to play the game on what she must feel is her personal server.  I do not see how this can be endorsed by Verant as a viable means of ensuring fair policy implementation across all servers.
<P>
Also note that a different set of players had previously died in the Plane of Fear some time ago and were given a complete corpse recovery by GM Camii who claims she informed then that there would be no more corpse recoveries from this zone.  The problem is none of the players who went in on this days raid were aware of this so called policy.  Nor should they have been expected to since it is not available anywhere as a public document.  No-one who entered that gate expected to get through the day without at least a couple of deaths.  But what was not expected was that everyone would die instantly due to a bug in the game and then be told by the very GM’s we indirectly employ that they had made a personal choice to not assist us any further.  Not a choice based on any public policy we are aware of as players, but rather one made up on a whim by the Server GM. <P>

Now I will also add that later in the day a guide on the server claimed that the decision was actually from Jeff Butler, the Head of the GM division.  But GM Camii informed me directly that the choice was her personal call, and I must take that direct evidence as the more relevant factor in all of this.
<P>
In all it took over 6 hours to recover the majority of the corpses.  Everyone lost close to or more than a levels worth of experience. Many lost items that are quite difficult to obtain from corpses ending up in the middle of scareling spawn areas and were unrecoverable.  In all this time the GM’s did not lift a finger to aid us.  It is my opinion that they completely failed in their duty to ensure players can play the game free from what I will call “programming and server caused frustrating events”.  We pay to play.  We do not pay to spend hours and hours in a corpse retrieval process losing even more hours of experience because of a fault in the zoning system not warned or mentioned of anywhere on any Verant information release, and then told on the whim of a server GM that they don’t feel like helping us today.
<P>
What has to occur in the very near future if Verant wishes to retain the players that have made Everquest the success it is, is that a <b>publicly released policy set</b> needs to be drawn up and made available to players.  I am not talking about leaked customer service manuals (although that was certainly insightful on how Verant views us the players).  I am talking about a document I can print out which tells me exactly what a GM can and can’t do and which applies across all servers uniformly.  It shouldn’t matter that my GM got out of bed and has a headache or is hungover.  It shouldn’t matter that I chose to play on Povar instead of say Fennin Ro or Veeshan (these are picked at random – no hidden meaning is being suggested here).  It shouldn’t matter that I have GM Camii instead of GM Helpful as my server GM.  I should be able to look in my document and see exactly what things a GM will and will not assist me including numerous example scenarios.  I should be able to download daily a list of known things that will cause a client crash so that I am aware of them.  
<P>
In short we need a number of things to change.  Firstly we need to get a clear list of uniform GM rules and responsibilities available to the public.   We should know exactly <b>why</b> GM’s are in the game.  Because if all they are there to do is pull corpses out of walls (which the guides always do anyway, not the server GM’s)  then Verant may as well sack them all and spend the money on some more coders to finish off the zones and fix the bugs.  Secondly we need a clear means of contacting the people who manage the Server GM’s, that is, their boss.  We need to have a means of reporting on how we feel GM’s are fulfilling the role defined by them in the document I have listed above.
<P>
We pay to play.  Server GM’s are paid to ensure we can play free from hindrance of problems caused by code or bug related problems.  Having to spend an entire day being told by GM’s that they <b>choose</b> not to help the players who have made the game what it is today for no other reason I can discern except that they don’t feel like it (from the statement made to me by GM Camii) is quite simply unacceptable.  If this is not the reason GM’s are in game then we the players deserve to be told exactly why they are there and what their job is <b>in writing</b>.  This whole saga has completely undermined my faith in the GM system as a whole.  Alienating the high level player base is certainly one way to deal with the lack of high level areas and activities – because sooner or later they will all quit the game.  
<P>
In conclusion I welcome an official response from Verant on this editorial and have notified them of it’s posting.  I also welcome any other reasoned and well worded response for or against my point of view and will post them up if sent to me.  My aim here is to get the problems fixed.  What happened with this event should not have.  The GM’s made a wrong decision and they are going to have to live with that for at least the rest of their time on Povar.  It is time for Verant to acknowledge they have some responsibilities to us as paying players, and release to the public the material I have discussed above.  They also need to provide a proper system of complaint so that GM’s are accountable when they fail to fulfil these responsibilities.   Hopefully this will occur before complete faith is lost in an already very unpredictable and unreliable customer service department.

<p><b><u>Verants Official Responses.</u></b></p>
<p>Hi there,<br>
<br>
I wanted to put this matter to rest once and for all. First and foremost is the
simple fact that there was indeed a problem that occurred when a large group of
players went into Fear. It affected around 10 of the people that went into the
Plane. Obviously that affected the rest of the group as well. After careful
consideration it was our determination to assist in corpse recovery for the
remaining players. To our knowledge this has been completed, and we are double
checking to make sure noone else slipped through the cracks. If anyone HAS
slipped through the cracks, please email <a href='mailto:jbutler@verant.com'>jbutler@verant.com</a>
and we will resolve this matter quickly.<br>
<br>
As a rule we do NOT do corpse recoveries on the Fear Plane simply because we
have VERY heavily published the fact that it is tremendously difficult. We are
working to resolve any problems that may remain. Until we announce this, you go
in there at your own peril.<br>
<br>
As for the GM's comments, in the future it is our goal to keep all GM's policies
consistent and clear. You can go to <a href='http://www.everquest.com'>www.everquest.com</a>
for a relatively complete list of what the Guides/GM's policies are.. It is the
GM/Guide FAQ if you are looking for specifics.<br>
<br>
We do apologize if anyone took what our GM said as offensive. It wasn't meant
that way and the GM's in the future will be able to do a more thorough
examination of problems like these.<br>

<p><b><u>The reply to this statement by Baelish,
with Responses from John Smedley.</u></b></p>
<p><b>I noticed the GM FAQ which you have added a
day or so ago and believe it is a step in the right direction.<br>
</b><br>
This FAQ has been up since day one of EQ going live by the way (seriously). It
may have been modified since then, but I guarantee it has been up. In fact about
2 months into EQ some players in a Guild that were banned made references to
this document in a very public editorial.<br>
<br>
It may not give everyone exactly the answers they want, but remember this is a
very large game and we are constantly revising the rules that we want GM's to
live by.</p>
<p><b>I am unsure abut your reference to 10 players
and recoveries.&nbsp; The entire recovery process was completed without any GM
assistance whatsoever until <u>after</u> my editorial was published and the zone
had its NPC's cleared to allow approximately 3 players who had major items
remaining to loot.&nbsp; 24 players died from the disconnection on zoning.&nbsp;
They all spent the next 6 hours without any GM support whatsoever doing a
recovery which they should not have been forced to do and some lost up to 8
bubbles of experience in doing so from the numerous deaths, which is a
significant number of hours in gameplay at that level.</b></p>
<p>You are absolutely right about the time frame. I
actually got involved based on your editorial which I thought was well written,
and well thought out. I called in and got the scoop and directed our GM's to a
log that could be used to verify who was booted. I then spoke with Jeff Butler
our Customer Service Manager and we agreed that the appropriate course of action
was to help with the Corpse Recoveries which I was told have been done over the
past 36 hours or so. Essentially it was my understanding that a lot of people
had already gotten their bodies out, but Jeff did have others helped.</p>
<p>We unfortunately can only allow help on the
Corpse Retrievals. You may not like that answer, but I can honestly say it's a
fair one in circumstances that can be unfair since we have no way of clearly
knowing how much exp someone lost OR what items they lost. This is NOT a slam at
players in any way, it's just that we do need ways of verifying what items have
been lost.&nbsp; You would be amazed at the number of Fiery Avengers that have
been &quot;lost&quot; over the past 6 months ;) .</p>
<p><b>We are all realistic players.&nbsp; Had we had
an opportunity to fight and died this would have been an entirely different
situation from simultaneous disconnection and death.&nbsp; I am sure you can
appreciate this.</b></p>
<p>Of this I have no doubt.<br>
<br>
<b>I would also add that many players would like to see a &quot;known
instability&quot; section.&nbsp; This would highlight those things players
should be aware of that may increase the chance of effected gameplay.</b></p>
<p>Please seriously consider that a section like
this while potentially valuable could give would be cheaters a place to start. I
have seriously weighed both sides of this issue and after careful consideration
by the entire EQ team we feel this is a dangerous place to venture.<br>

<b>My editorial was not designed to be a personal attack on any GM, but rather
at the inconsistent and unpredictable application of GM Policy within Everquest.&nbsp;
Unfortunately this was an extreme example - and taking it to a public forum has
been the only way to get any recognition of the problem.&nbsp; I would like to
be kept informed of any developments and changes that are made to the system so
that I may present a complete picture to players.</b></p>
<p><b>My aim was not inflame a situation, but to
improve the game for all involved.&nbsp; I hope this can be understood from your
end.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>You absolutely did not inflame a situation. You
merely pointed out that flaws do in fact exist in our GM system. I absolutely
want you and others like you to continue to point out the problems. At least you
are able to do so in a civil manner which really makes us take notice. Believe
me, the first cuss word I see I stop reading, which leads to a lot of unread
emails.</p>
<p>Next time around I want the GM to handle the
situation differently. In point of fact it wasn't necessarily the decision that
was made (which was only based upon information the GM had at the time), but the
way it was explained to players. At all times we want our GM's to be consistent
and fair and polite. Believe me the GM in this case is an incredibly fair
person.. it just came across harsher than we would have liked.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that part of what you pay us
for is Customer Service. We darn well better provide it!!<br>
<br>
Let me close by saying that we seriously want to help players. We understand
what paying monthly means.. it means people expect SERVICE. We totally
understand that, even if at times it can seem like we don't.<br>
<br>
I know we can only take care of the future by improving on our handling of
Customer Service.<br>

<p><b><u>Final Comment by Baelish</u></b></p>
<p>So a few months down the track where are we
at?&nbsp; Well first I would like to reiterate the aim of this whole
editorial.&nbsp; When the incident occurred there had been numerous recent
attempts across a number of servers on the Plane of Fear, and many had
failed.&nbsp; The problem was that every server's Admin-GM was treating the
situation differently.&nbsp; My complaint in this editorial was that they should
<u>all</u> help retrieve corpses, <u>all</u><i> </i>say no to assisting, or <u>all</u>
kill the zone off.&nbsp; I was looking to get uniformity.&nbsp; The second thing
I was looking for was some way for players to know in advance what this
uniformity would be by access to a public list.</p>
<p>Well we never got the list.&nbsp; The Guide/GM
FAQ was updated as a result of the editorial, and I think at the very least,
awareness of its existence was highlighted.</p>
<p>However, we have a lot more uniformity in some
areas now, with most Admin-GMs giving out <u>much</u> less overall assistance in
any type of recovery.&nbsp; Then again, we now also have Necromancer's with the
Summon Corpse spell and the like.</p>
<p>Lastly Verant recoded zone-ins to make them less
likely to cause mass linkdeath when large numbers of players simultaneously zone
in.&nbsp; Unfortunately this is still not a complete fix for people on modem
connections which just can't handle the amount of information the server is
sending them in these situations.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to make it clear that I did <u>not</u>
single out GM-Camii for any personal attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<P>
  However, in order to highlight the extreme
  problems with GMs from server to server applying different policies, and even
  some on some servers applying different policies to the same situations on a
  day to day basis, it was necessary to include an example.&nbsp; Camii was
  simply the Manager on Duty at the time and had to cop the brunt of it.&nbsp;
  Every other GM on every other server, and the policy makers at Verant
  themselves were all part of the body I was criticizing.&nbsp; It was not my
  intent to question Camii's ability to be a GM, she has been a very reasonable
  and fair person to deal with both before and after this editorial.&nbsp;
  I know that she was only doing her job as a GM on the day the events occurred.&nbsp;
  Likewise, I was only doing my job as a long term paying customer in trying to
  make things better.
  <p>My sole aim here has always been to get the
  system fixed.&nbsp; I am sure it not only made the GM's tasks harder when
  there was no clear application of policy on a global basis, but also made
  playing the game harder for players when even after looking at the GM / Guide
  FAQ on the Everquest site, the rules were not applied equally.
