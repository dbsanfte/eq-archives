<br>
<b>Divine Stun:</b> (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability gives
the Paladin the power to use spells with a stun component to affect NPCs of
levels up to 60th. Those spells will still grant the NPC a saving throw and its
normal resistances, it only raises the level limitation for stun spells to 60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Double Riposte:</b> (3 skill levels) - This ability gives the Paladin a
chance for a double riposte any time he successfully ripostes. The first skill
level gives the Paladin a 15% chance for a Double Riposte, the second skill

<br>
<b>Mass Group Buff:</b> (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability
gives the Paladin the power to make his next group buff spell into an area of
affect spell. The spell would benefit everyone in the area, not just the
caster's group. This Ability causes the spell to use up to as much as twice as
much mana. It will require at least the normal casting cost, and will use up to
as much as twice the mana if the caster has that much available. The Refresh
Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time).<br>
<br>
<b>Physical Enhancement:</b> (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This
ability gives the Paladin one additional skill level in their Natural
Durability, Combat Agility and Combat Stability abilities.<br>
<br>

Archetype ability Combat Fury) - This ability turns the Paladin's critical hits
into massive damage to undead.</p>
