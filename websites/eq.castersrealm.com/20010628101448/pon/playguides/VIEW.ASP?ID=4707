  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p>The Paladin's overall role is a primary tank. As tank, they
take damage and hit their enemies with their weapon. But at level
9, they change a little bit. They get spells, such as buffs
(increase abilities) and heals (heal HP of others).<br>
<br>
MAKING A PALADIN<br>
Caster's Realm's creation is an excellent guide. I, however have
one suggestion: try to increase your wisdom. At higher levels
Strength is a dime a dozen; a higher wisdom will allow you to be
a better healer, a role you may need to take on later on. But, of
course, the choice the yours.<br>
<br>
WEAPONRY<br>
The Paladin is left with two main choices: Two Hand Slashing, or
One Hand Slashing and use of a shield. This decision can be
reached by the options open to you. Two Hand Slashing is
excellent for great amounts of damage, and One Hand Slashing is
good because Paladins get some good 1 hand slashers and Bash (at
level 8) is excellent for interrupting casters if you are
proficient with it. You may want to try what I've done with my
Paladin: I have a Bag of Sewn Evil Eyes full of weapons. A
piercer, one hand blunt, two hand blunt, a one hand slasher, and
my faithful two hand slasher. This allows you to train up your
other skills for when Verant decides to make sweet new weapons
for Paladins.<br>
<br>
ARMOR<br>
Focus on AC and Strength! These are needed above all others to
successfully tank in a group. AC reduces damage so you won't be a
mana hole for the healers, and Strength allows you to hit as hard
as Warriors. Additionally at higher levels, you will want a set
of Wisdom adding gear, as well as various sets of armor designed
for certain raids (fire and cold especially). Also, Paladin armor
and weapon quests are difficult and long. Try these at your own
risk. The Paladin only Silentwatch Shield is an excellent quest
to try with some help at around 35+. Armor of Ro is very hard to
get simply because of the Ronium, a very hard quest in and of
itself to do.<br>
<br>
FIGHTING<br>
Up till level 9, just run up and hit stuff or shoot them with
your bow and arrow. Past level 9 though, you'll want to make sure
you are buffed. At 22 and beyond, you can also try the risky
option of rooting and then healing yourself in mid-combat, but
this is difficult to successfully do. Stun (level 30) is great
for pulling and interrupting casters. As a defensive tank, you'll
want to make sure you taunt as much as possible (make sure you
have a good healer). You can deal out the damage, almost as good
as warriors. At level 39, soloing becomes possible with the new
Velious spell Divine Purpose. You also receive excellent buffs
and Yaulp II. With all these added together, you can make an
effective soloist. To do this, make sure you are AT LEAST 5
levels above anything you are fighting, make sure you can single
pull, make sure the targets are not undercons (con lower than
what they really are), and MAKE SURE YOU ARE BUFFED. Always keep
Divine Purpose, Yaulp II, Daring, Guard, and your symbol spell
up. Clarity can help greatly because it counteracts Divine
Purpose and allows you to still have mana to 'heal up' after
battle. Grouping is still safer and, in some cases, better
experience depending on where and what you fight. But try out
soloing if you can, it's knda fun and eliminates the boredom of
waiting to get in a group.<br>
<br>
HEALING AND BUFFING<br>
Always ask if your group needs Paladin buffs. If there is not a
Cleric, your AC and symbol buffs will stack with the Druids' Skin
Like... series as well as Shaman Buffs. Paladin healing is ideal
for rest-time. Make sure your group's healers know that you can
heal a little bit during a group's downtime. This will save the
main healer's mana for combat time, so you don't die! Focus on
healing the tanks, or maybe Shaman and Necros so they can
Cannibalize or Liche themselves.<br>
<br>
LAY ON HANDS<br>
Lay on Hands is a Paladin-only ability that is an answer to the
Shadowknight's Harm Touch. Essentially it is a spell that heals
any target a number of HP equal to the Paladin's base HP. It
recharges every game day (72 minutes). It can be used while
running. You can still cast while being attacked as long as you
aren't bashed while casting it. And it isn't self-only, so if you
see a guy in your group about to die and the healers are out of
mana, give the brother some help and Lay on Hands him. This works
for the better of the group.<br>
WHERE TO FIGHT<br>
Levels 1-5: Fight in your home area: Butcherblock, West Freeport,
Qeynos, etc.<br>
<br>
Levels 6-12: Start fighting in Misty Thicket!! The experience
here is amazing and you can fly through your early levels. I take
all my newbies here to get fast and easy experience. Fight
Goblins till about level 10, and then Young Kodiaks and Giant
Scarbs and Orcs. You may even want to try grouping.<br>
<br>
Levels 13-17 or 18: Start fighting Dervish Cutthroats either in
North Ro or in West Commonlands. Groups are easy to find, bronze
weapons sell for a couple platinum, and experience is great. Also
try Oasis of Marr at these levels, fighting crocs and orcs.<br>
<br>
Levels 18-20: Highpass Hold! Gnolls and Orcs provide great
experience and the occasionally Polished Granite Tomahawk or
Cracked Darkwood Shield.<br>
<br>
Levels 21-29: Fight Sarnaks in Lake of Ill Omen. Probably the
best experience you'll ever see. Occasional Sarnak Earring of
Station or other Sarnak Legionairre loot is great too.<br>
<br>
Levels 30-42: OVERTHERE!! Other people will tell you Frontier
Mountains, but the possibility of a sweet experience group in the
Overthere far outweighs the poor experience, decent loot, and
trainability of those undercon Mountain Giants. Your first hell
levels will fly by in the Overthere.<br>
<br>
Level 43+: City of Mist and surrounding areas will see you to
your upper levels. At 46 the Planes open up as well as higher
dungeons in Velious and Kunark. Loot will increase to uber status
and before you know it, you'll be the envy of all your friends.<br>
<br>
ROLEPLAYING A PALADIN<br>
For the hardcore roleplayer, a Paladin can be fun to roleplay
with if you're into the goody two-shoes image. You'll want to
help people when you see damsels (or dudes) in distress. Of
course, you can always do you what I've done and created a
Paladin who has rebelled against the constraining way of being
scrupulous. Then again, I still help people when I see em in
trouble; hey, maybe I can pick up some plat from em :)<br>
<br>
All in all, a Paladin is a great class to play and is slowly
emerging as one of the better tank classes in the game. I hope
this guide had helped all you lil' Pallies out there!<br>
