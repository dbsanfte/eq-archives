     <p> <i>IT’S HIM!</i> She thinks to herself as she sees him walking up to the castle.  She can’t believe her eyes.  He has been gone so long.  She begins to run through the corridors to greet him when she hears screams echoing through the great halls.  She looks out the window to see the guards’ are dead; each sliced through at the midsection bodies severed completely in half.  Then she sees him laughing at the dead corpses examining the weaponry they were carrying.  He stops abruptly and looks directly at her.  His eyes are lit aflame glowing bright orange.  She wonders <i>what is wrong with him.  Does he not remember this palace?  The place where he grew up?</i>  She glances away and begins running through the hallways toward his position. </p>  

     <p> <i>Who was that girl? Do I know her from somewhere?</i> He wonders.  Those eyes seem like something from my childhood.  <i>AHHHHHH god not again!</i> He doubles over in pain his master is sending him. <i>Does my master not want me to think of her, is she really from my past.  No she can’t be I have never even been to this place in my life.  Or have I?  No forget it I must complete my masters task.</i> He thinks.  “THIS CASTLE WILL BE DESTROYED AT THE HANDS OF ONE MAN,” he yells, and laughs!  He feels the power coercing through him and swell in his hands as he blasts away the barriers, the last defense for the city.  He sheaths his sword.  Its icy flames die out in his holster.  He begins to enter but stops seeing the girl standing in front of him.  He moves his hands to incarnate a spell with which to destroy her. ! @FLAMING EARTH@ !.  Flames travel at a rapid speed toward her.  Seeming to ignite the very earth they travel over.</p>

     <p> <i>Let’s see how strong he has become.</i>  She raises her hands so her palms are facing him and a blue shield of manna forms around her. As the flames crash into her shield they engulf it completely.  She is knocked back by the power of his incantation and her only defense is diminished.  He draws his sword and points it at her throat.  Its icy blue flames ignite causing her to cower away.  They stare into each other’s eyes for a moment.  “Uzaro, I love you,” she whispers loud enough for his ears only, and she begins to cry.  He begins to swing the sword to dispatch of her head, but then he is stopped.  He listens to her crying and somehow cannot kill her.  She looks up at him curiously, at his fiery blue eyes, a tear streaming down her cheek.  Then he falls over and curls up in a ball. </p>  

     <p> He begins to scream, “ Why, why, why.  Why must I destroy this city and these helpless people?  Why are you hiding my true past from me?  I can sense this place has something to do with it.  What is it you will gain from this M'Lord?” The pain is so overwhelming he goes into a state of unconsciousness.He wakes up only to find deep green eyes looking at him, filled with worry.  He groans at the pain still in his mind and his master’s words repeating over and over… </p> 

     <p> <i> YOU FOOL, YOU FOOL, YOU FOOL…. Uzaro you have failed me, but I must find a way to get you back you are to valuable.  Just stay calm until I can</i>.  He tries to speak only to find himself unable.  He has had this shut off by his master, Keudan, probably for a number of different reasons.  All he does is look up into her eyes, thinking who she is.  Suddenly as if answering him, her name appears etched into his head <i>Kamella</i>. He realizes their connection and a way he can communicate with her.  He begins to ask questions but then she says <i>Shut up and listen to me, must I remind you of your past?</i> </p>	

     <p> <i>It was 5 years ago tomorrow, the day you were sent off to destroy the clans who kept attacking us.  They stopped, but you never came back.  We became worried but we knew that you succeeded and the city was safe. Everyone rejoiced that our finest warrior has defeated our foe.  Everyone except me… We grew up together; we may have had hardships being from two different houses. The Du’Prae’s for you, Uzaro, and the Ke’Laer’s for me.  But we got along, even through all that fighting.  We fell in love and after talking it through with our parents and a little convincing we got our families to get along and we eventually became like one big family.  We got old enough to be wed, and planned a huge party for it and the date.  Then you had to leave; when we found out we both cried and held each other all night.  The day you had to leave, you gave me this to remember you by, incase something… happened.  We said when you came back we would continue with our wedding plans and live happy forever, with the impossible already done of uniting our clans we had the hard part finished.</i></i> </p> 	
     
     <p> She shows him the ring, and as if a spark went off in his head he remembered everything. He reached up and put his arms around her and started to cry.  “When I had destroyed the enemy, I couldn’t think of any reason to go back, or someone had tricked me and blocked the memory of this place off.  So I began to follow Keudan and he lead me and taught me how to use my sword and then sent me to destroy this place.  He had a direct connection to me just like you and he gave me great pain if I did anything wrong.  I… I feel like I have been released from him now.  Maybe discovering my past was the way to escape him.  Hey I can speak again,” said Uzaro.  They sit there for a while, holding each other, both too happy to be back with the other.  “There was one other thing you left behind for me to have.  When you left I had discovered I was pregnant with our child, his name is Vindae Du’Prae.  He is your heir, for you my love are now Lord Du’Prae, Ruler of Kardith, Follower of Innoruk.  Well if we can convince the council members, it might be kind of hard after you destroyed our garrison and almost killed me, the Queen until your return.  I doubt we can get them to believe you are really you,” exclaimed Kamella with sarcasm.  Uzaro responds with a laugh, “I know how to convince them , where is my sword and where do I find the council members.” </p>
     
     <p> They gather everybody up in the great hall, voices whispering to each other about what is going on.  Kamella quiets everybody down and announces the reason for this meeting.  “Today we are gathered here so that I may step down from the thrown for the true ruler of this great land.  I know what you are all thinking.  Uzaro has returned?  When did this happen?  Well he has returned indeed but not in the manner you thought he would.  Here is our fine and noble Lord,” Kamella states as she brings out Uzaro.  Everyone gasps and someone shouts, “That is not Uzaro do not let him trick you my fair queen he is a fake we must execute him at once.”  Everyone begins to mumble as Uzaro begins to speak. </p>
	
     <p> “My friends, allies, and probably enemies,” exclaims Uzaro with a big smile on his face as everyone laughs.  “I know what you all think, this is NOT who he says he is.  But what if I could prove it to you. He draws his sword and it ignites.  What if there really was a way to be sure.  What I am about to do is something passed on ONLY to future rulers to this land and it was passed on to me before my leave.  None of you have seen this done for 5 years and only have memories of it.  He points his sword at the large iron double doors behind him.  This room has been sealed for 5 years.  It was last opened to decide whether I would leave to stop the enemies or whether we would try another soldier.  Unfortunately you chose me to go and though I stopped the enemy I was captured and enslaved.  There is only one way in the world to open them, this long lost spell.  He begins to chant in the old tongue, which only few in the crowd can understand.  Manna begins to form around his hand spiraling into glowing balls in each of his fists.  He then opens his hands palms up and the balls leave.  They spiral around each other toward the door and land in special symbols on the door and they began to glow. His eyes began to change from there icy blue to a bright glowing orange.  The old doors shake and slowly began to open. </p>
