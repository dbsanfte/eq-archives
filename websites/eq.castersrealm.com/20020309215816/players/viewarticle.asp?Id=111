     Miragul walked among the plant life, listening to the calls of the forests.  Calls he had not heard in ages, though he still wondered how long he had been <i>dead</i>.  And even while he was alive, he failed to capture nature preferring to live in solitaire, for various reasons.  At his sash, a gnoll had made a small leather holster for the crystal and tome, as he and it talked occasionally.  As they walked, Branok stood beside Miragul, while the other gnolls walked behind them, letting the mage lead with the aid of the crystal.<p>
     Hours seemed to pass, and not one being had been seen.  The mage found it odd, that this once busy forest was now lifeless of people.  Barnok found it odd as well, since the gnoll forces were supposed to be here, but perhaps they had failed in Qeynos.  Thinking on the matter, Miragul figured that the Erudite's stayed in their city for fear of the heretics and those in Paineel had the same fear of those in Erudin.  Without thinking, they walked into a clearing, free of trees as the slowly fading sun's rays hit the green growth on the ground.  Miragul halted, as did Barnok who started to sniff at the air.  The crystal began to vibrate.<p>
     "Here, Miragul." pulsed the crystal's metallic chimes.<p>
     Miragul nodded at the air, understanding what he had heard and turned around to the other gnolls.<p>
     "We set camp here till however long this takes."  The mage spoke in their tongue and received nods in replies.<p>
     However, Barnok was not just satisfied with such response and began to use his commanding abilities towards the gnolls, "light no fires, set up a two guard watch, exchanging shifts every four hours."<p>
     Barnok gave further instructions but were faded out by the chimes speaking once again.<p>
     "Now, let's hurry.  Remove the tome from your waist, and look at the cover's symbol," Miragul did as he was instructed, letting his hands sear in pain, "speak this word ‘<i>Takish'Urian</i>', not letting your eyes off the symbol."<p>
     As the mage did this, a purplish haze engulfed his head and he gasped in either pain or pleasure, if not both.  As the haze cleared, turning into a liquid dripping onto his skin and robe, he noticed the tome had changed.  The rune on the front, he could now read as he raised eye brow, it read ‘Blessed Tome of  Innoruuk'.			<p>
     "Now, the pain should be greatly reduced, the magic about the tome has read your common language and translated the tome accordingly," Miragul was already flipping through pages eyeing spells he had never heard of and could only imagine their power, "turn to the back of the tome, there is a page that is labeled ‘Reconstruct'.  In our case, it will call up the ancient Tower of Diz'Urian."<p>
     Turning to the back, the mage found the spell which had been mentioned.  It was in an added section, which had been labeled ‘Our Return Brothers'.  The spell after this title page was labeled ‘Preserving Crystal of Un-detection', next was the ‘Reconstruct' spell.  Miragul studied it for about thirty minutes, or until the crystal began to impatiently ask him when he was going to cast the spell.  The mage was just absolutely stunned by the utter complexity of the spell, but after a few more moments he realized that a few gestures were simple, and often repeated.  A smile broke his lips.<p>
      Holding the tome in one hand, supported by his right arm.  Miragul, the once great mage, began to weave a spell Norrath had not seen in ages.  His left hand traced symbols into the air, speaking dark incantations causing them to catch aflame, only to be replaced by another symbol.  Midway through the weaving, the ground violently shook, sending all the gnolls, except Barnok, to the ground.  <p>
     The earth groaned, pulling trees into it's belly.  Cracks in the ground shot forth brilliant flames of crimson fire, as steam shot off in geysers.  The roaring that followed was greater than that of any thunder storm.  In the distance, scouting flares shot up from Erudin, who were obviously feeling this quake.  The once small lush green clearing, soon turned into a valley of a treeless landscape, aflame with fire from the deepest earth.<p>
     Still, the spell was being wove, as beads of sweat began to slide down the great mage's face.  Before him, a charred black stone rose protruding from the earth.  As it continued to rise, it gave form to a grand tower, rising until it reached ten stories tall.  It's thickness matched that of any normal mage tower, but very few towers were made of pure onyx.  As the spell completed, another purplish looking haze ran up and down the tower, removing the charred blemishes, restoring them to their onyx texture.  Slowly, the rumblings subsided.<p>
     They all stood dumb founded in front of the pure black tower, amazed by it's utter dark beauty.  Glowing runes, a few similar to the one on the cover of the tome, lined the sides.  The tower held no windows, not even a door, it was just a black ten story enclosure, of the smoothest appearance.  The crystal let out a small chuckle, almost frightening if one stared at the tower and heard it at once.<p>
     "Now, take this crystal, and walk into the only red rune.  That is where the alter lies," as it chimed, a thunderous noise filled the air in the distance, the thunder of a portal burning the air, "now Miragul!"<p>
     Jostled by the command, the mage ran towards the red rune, followed by a gnoll guard.  Miragul entered first, feeling a little disoriented, but the gnoll behind him fell into the room without flesh or muscle, only a blood drenched pile of bones and fur.  Paying no attention to the gnoll's fate, Miragul glanced about the room, but all he could see was complete blackness.  It seemed as if the crystal could sense this, as it changed color from the pulsing white, to a pulsing blue.<p>
     The mage's eyes glazed over, as he began to look around more, everything seemed to be coated in a blueish haze.  This was the sight of the dark elves, and now as he looked about the room, he saw everything.  Well, the only thing there was to see.  In the precise center of the room, an altar rested.  As Miragul examined it, he noticed it looked to be a barbarian man, with huge wings extending from it's back.  The statue's hands were raised and met at the point where the tips of the wings did as well.  The hands and wings formed a holder.<p>
     "Place this crystal into the holder atop the wings and hands, then turn to the back of the tome and recite the small rite and incantation, titled ‘Welcome Back Brothers'," to Miragul the crystal started to sound more human like, and more assure of itself.  He questioned what he was doing, but only for a moment, it was worth the power of this tome.<p>
     Placing the crystal into the holder of the statue, he stepped back and opened the tome.  However, his sight had returned to nothingness.  Not sure what to do now, the crystal spoke again.<p>
     "Keep looking at the tome, it's already in your head, and it will adjust to aid you in your situation," spoke the darkness.<p>
     As the mage looked at the tome, the runes and titles began to glow.  Smiling into the darkness, he continued his search for the ancient rite.  Speaking slowly from the book, the room was engulfed in white, and black streaks of lightning bolted about him and the white statue in the center.  As Miragul breathed, it seemed to burn his lungs.  Outside, he thought he heard an explosion, but nothing could be done about it now.  He had to finish what he started, for he knew what happened to half finished spells of high art.  <p>
     Miragul began to speak the last line of the incantation as time seemed to slow to a crawl.  His muscles ached to speak, his throat ran dry, he rasped out the few syllables.  His head swam in a world of total torment.  His skin began to catch aflame with black fire, as the bolts of blackness continued to streak about and around the white room.  Blood began to trickle from his mouth and eyes, as he gagged out the last words.  As his world began to darken the thoughts of the tome streamed into his mind, and the unmatched power.  With that, he slumped onto the ground, blood exiting from every opening on his body.<p>
     From the crystal, lightning burst out.  Crashing violently into the white walls, sending holes into the outside world.  A torrent of screams followed, as this life was being called back into the world of Norrath.  With one extreme sonic pulse, the crystal broke and engulfed the room in a blue haze.  As it faded, a man stood in the place of the statue, yet bearing no wings.<p>
     The man looked around, his hair silvered and his features young and sunken in.  He stood naked, staring down at the corpse of Miragul.  <p>
     "That, Miragul, is why I needed you.  Any other mage would have died after the first breath of the spell, though I had thought you could possibly have endured through it," the voice sounded utterly horrific, deep and raspy.  A voice that is given to the darkest of gods, and not any mortal man.<p>
     As the man gazed about the room, his eyes were pitch black, holding no white color, his skin pale and cut from markings made many centuries ago.  Or, was it a millennia ago?  It didn't matter, as a deep throaty laugh surfaced from his dark belly causing it to echo out into the forest.  His plan had worked.  He had risen.<p>
<center>**********************************************</center><p>
     Simonic's legs beat hard as they traveled in a direction they seemed to already know.  Dorson heaved heavily chasing after the image of flying silver hair and flailing robes ahead of him.  It was now that Dorson could see Sim's staff pulsating.  Not knowing why it was doing so, he figured it's wielder did.  Another log, and another jump, they had run for about ten minutes straight and still no sign of gnolls or any other life form.<p>
     The air beat hard against their faces and very little light, either it be night or day, penetrated far enough through the trees above making it hard to see clear forms.  Suddenly, Sim came to an abrupt halt, his staff glowing a hazy blue.  Moments before it let loose a thunderous shot that caused Dor to cuff one of his ears.  Sim paid no attention to the thunder and wove a quick spell that sent Dorson into the air, he recast the spell again and he then took flight above the ground.  After he took flight, the ground moaned as if in extreme pain.  The mage continued pursuit again, above violently shaking grounds.<p>
     As Dor followed in the trail of the mage, he began to wonder what could have made the ground moan like that, and was that why the staff was glowing?  As his thoughts continued to wander, the ground shook as if screaming, sending trees swaying.  Even as they breathed, it felt as if the air cried out.  Branches crashed about them, as the ground quickened it's violent jolts.  A geyser of steam shot off in the far distance, followed by a huge gout of flame.<p>
     What was going on?  From the direction of the Spires of Erudin, huge balls of light went out into the forest.  They were their observation flares, perhaps even wizard eyes.  Something was definitely not right, and as if the earth seemed to agree, it split behind them.  Sending up a wall of flame in protest to what was occurring.<p>
     It wasn't until now that Dor realized that they were headed directly for the flames and where a huge pillar of smoke rose high into the forest air.  The mage, however, seemed to move his legs faster overcoming normal limits on human speed.  Forcing the druid to stop and cast a quick spell, granting him a scale of speed over a normal man.  Even this, however, was not fast enough to outrun the mage. Boggling at the thought for a moment, he halted, as they reached a clearing, lifeless of trees as if they had been sucked into the ground.  <p>
     About a hundred yards away, a huge tower loomed.  It was darker than the darkest night, and glistened as the fire's light hit it, as the sun was lurking behind the world.  Simonic stopped, hair blowing behind him as he stood there holding his staff, glowing a dark red.  A pained look overcame his face as his eyes remained transfixed on the tower.<p>
     Gnolls were about the tower, standing a little ways off, many of them were on the ground hiding themselves from something that Dorson could not figure or see.  As he gazed at the gnolls, a huge roar of flame engulfed many of them.  The sky above them poured ice onto their half setup camp, sending many to crashing shards of ice, only to be melted by the intense heat about the area.  It's source could not be seen.  <p>
     "I'm too late," uttered the mage, as he continued to stare at the black tower.<p>
     "For what?"  Asked Dorson, logically.<p>
     As he waited for his reply, dark jet black bolts of lightning pierced through the tower, slicing through anything they passed.  Tree's fell in half, as various gnoll's were stripped of a middle, or wherever the bolt hit.  The roaring of this magic was overwhelming, sending churning cries into the blazing night sky, droning out any cries the ground continued to make.  Then, in moments, it all stopped.  And left a pierced tower, with white glimmering holes of blue then faded white where lightning had bolted out.<p>
     "He has been risen," spoke Simonic, in an sad resolute tone.<p>
     "Who?"<p>
     Again, before the mage could answer, a rough menacing laugh filled the treeless valley about them, and seemed to echo even into the depths of the hole found within Paineel.  If one listened hard enough, perhaps they would have said those voices from within the pit of the hole, cried out in horror.<p>
<center>**********************************************<p>
<b>NEXT SERIES</b><p></center>
With the ancient lich, Miragul, dead.  And an unknown man risen.  What are the realms
to do?<p>
Simonic still keeps things within hidden, as his companion, Dorson, is left in a world
of wondering.  Ebon is still within Qeynos along with Camlend, as Sekerv is left 
wandering alongside the
Gnolls.<p>
Yet, something is about to take place that could impact all of life upon Norrath.  
Magics fade from the
minds of men for a reason, not to be reinvoked, yet what happens when one 
invokes the
magic of the gods.<p>
