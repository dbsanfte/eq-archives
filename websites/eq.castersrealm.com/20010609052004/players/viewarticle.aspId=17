Chapter 3. Whatever you can do, I've done it better<br>
------------------------------------ </p>

<p>Everything hurts... what happened...am i dead...no...im
alive...i think...o my
head....momma....... </p>

<p>&quot;How long has he been asleep Ashyur?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Nearly 4 days M'lord. I am surprised he has survived
this long. His blood line is strong, so
it isn't too much of a suprise&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Flattery won't get you everywhere Ashyur&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I meant his mother&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You tread a thin line.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't have it any other way.&quot; </p>

<p>......Its so dark.....am i blind?...no.....stupid...open your
eyes..... </p>

<p>Raziel woke in a daze. So much had happened. It was dark
outside; the moons were high
in the sky. Raziel stumbled away from the barrier, looking for
the exit. </p>

<p>Were is the door? O..forget it..it hurts to much to
move......Mother... </p>

<p>Raziel sat before the barrier, and cried. </p>

<p>-------------------------- </p>

<p>&quot;M'lord. The boy is awake&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Already? He has healed quickly.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;As I said before his mother blood, gives him advantages
over pure erudite such as
ourselves&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You make it seem like he is one of your experiments
Ashyur&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe. I had pressured the Council to encourage
outmating for exactly this reason, but
that is a moot point M'lord&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Then we won't give it a second thought then. Tell me
what can you sense from him?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Don't hide anything from me Ashyur or ill absorb it out
of you&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;.. I cant sense anything from him M'lord. That terrifies
me M'lord&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ahh because your keen senses have failed you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No. What terrifies me is that either his strength is so
great that cant be measured or
that it is so great he doesn't want it to be measured&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So. After nearly 300 years, I maybe able to join the
Halls of Jahorn.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Don't count your Sarvlaks before they hatch.&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>Raziel was staring out the barrier, when a tall man entered
the room. Raziel leapt to his
feet and prepared himself to attack, but he relaxed slightly when
he recognized the
shadowed figure. But they said nothing, only looking at each
other. No hate or trust was
formed, just a blank stare </p>

<p>They stared at each other for an interminable period, and then
the figure turned and
exited the room. </p>

<p>&quot;As soon as he is strong enough, he'll join my
trainees.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Shouldn't he at least learn something from the Knight
Guild Masters first, before he join
the Hell Knights?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;All the way or not all. I won't take other student
sullied by their infernal pestilence&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Old age has made you bitter&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No.. exhaustion&quot; </p>

<p>------------------------- </p>

<p>Over the course of 10 years, I learned from Malik. Training
night and day, learning how to
fight, how let my blade cut through my foes, how to manipulate
the winds of mana to my
bidding. But I grew impatient, as I leapt past the others Shadow
and Hell alike, I wanted
out of this damn rock prison. </p>

<p>Loud cracks echoed through Paineel. In the great training
grounds, Raziel was dispatching
skeletal servants with single blows. Sometimes fading in and out
of the shadows to get
some room, but not to escape the onslaught of blows from the
servants, but to revel in
the sight of hundreds of shattered and chipped bones, scattered
across the field. The sight of smoking bones that had been magically blasted into
oblivion. </p>

<p>One last servant charged him, he simply watched as the
servant's fist flew in to strike him. The fist seemed to strike a barrier, and then the skeleton
glowed white briefly and
shattered. Raziel yawned. </p>

<p>Why am I still here? I have already beaten everything thrown
at me; I spend all day
training new recruits and myself. Why haven't I been given an out
mission? </p>

<p>I have had it! I am not taking this any more. He faded into
the shadows. </p>

<p>Fading back in he reappeared in the Hell Lord's quarters. Damn
it! Where is he!?! He faded
again. </p>

<p>&quot;M'lord you should know that Raziel is looking for
you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And this is of what importance to me?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;...well.None really.. but it is related to another
matter.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel is growing careless. His fighting strength has
far outmatched any of trainees. But
he refuses to learn any tactics what so ever. He is wasting to
much of his time showing
off his power, he will become hopelessly weak at this rate
M'lord&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; I understand M'lord, it will be done&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel faded inside the Necromancer guild, and was about to
fade out again when a voice
called out to him </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;M'lord Asyhur&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why are you deviating from your training regimen?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Because I tire of it. I want out of this city!' </p>

<p>&quot;Hmm. It seems Cazic has blessed you then. We have a
mission for you&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Finally!&quot; </p>

<p>Ashyur chanted a quick spell and a shimmering globe appeared
in front of Raziel. In the
globe a figure appeared. </p>

<p>&quot;Why are you showing me a digusting creature as
this?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Because you are to kill it and bring me its head. It is
wandering in the Toxxulia forest
gathering information for a raiding party. Leave at once&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel did not bother with formalities and faded away.<br>
------------------------------------------- </p>

<p>Raziel appeared on the Ivory Bridge. Making a quick check of
his chainmail and his blade,
he then peered out into the fog. There it was, off in the
distance, heading to the ancient
docks to Kerra Isle. </p>

<p>Trolls...what filthy creatures.. </p>

<p>He leapt into the shadows and reappeared a few feet behind the
Troll. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey lard ass!&quot; </p>

<p>The Troll turned around &quot;Me no Lardazz, Me Rungupp!
&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Your pretty stupid to invade into our territory. Now
you're going to pay with your life&quot; </p>

<p>The Troll roared and sent a large barrage of ice at Raziel.
But Raziel faded away and
reappeared a few feet away. </p>

<p>&quot;Is that all you can do?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Me Rungupp bash silly tan man!&quot; The troll lifted a
large hammer above its head and
roared again. It charged Raziel. Raziel disappeared and a large
shadow whipped across
the Troll. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey dumb ass. You missing these?&quot; Raziel slowly
faced the Troll and casually tossed the
Troll arms at him. The Troll howled in pain as blood flowed from
the stumps. Raziel
charged forward and ran his blade into the troll driving him into
a tree. </p>

<p>&quot;That was easy.&quot; The blade made a squishy sound as
he removed it, he turn and walk
over to the river to clean off his blade. There was movement
behind him. He turned to
see the bloody troll charge him. </p>

<p>Not even thinking, strings of mana flowed to his hands, and
formed a sphere. </p>

<p>** &quot;Pressure Cannon!&quot; the mana ball leaped from his
hands and smashed into the troll's
head splattering it across the forest. </p>

<p>The body fell to the ground lifeless. However, it did not stay
that way, the lacerated
organs began to regrow, and soon the troll rose again. </p>

<p>** &quot; Its impossible, he's still alive!&quot; Grabbing the
troll by the throat, he threw the troll as
high as he could. His body faded out, reappeared, and disappeared
around the airborne
troll. His blade chopping of large chunks of the troll and
sending them everywhere. Soon
exhausted, he crashed to the ground the parts of the troll
following suit. And again the
pieces began to regrow. Raziel exhausted, watched as the Troll
regenerated. In less then
a minute the troll was at full strength, not even a scar showed.
Raziel again launched an
assault on the troll, chopping it to pieces. &quot;WHY WONT YOU
DIE!&quot; he screamed as he cut
it down repeatedly. </p>

<p>I am not going to be beat by a moronic... foul.. digusgting
creatures like this! Raziel's
anger rose and soon he began to radiate energy. It was blistering
out and the troll seem
to fear the heat. </p>

<p>So you don't like heat do you...ILL SHOW YOU!!!! </p>

<p>His rage exploded in him and his blade went white. &quot;NOW
YOU DIE!!!!!&quot; he charged the
troll, and it's head departed its body. The body did not
regenerate.<br>
------------------ </p>

<p>Raziel walk slowly through the streets of Paineel carrying the
head, his chainmail covered
with greenish blood. He entered the necromancer guild, and tossed
the head into Ashyur's
lap. </p>

<p>Ashyur laughed. </p>

<p>&quot;Just as I thought, your arrogance in your power nearly
killed you Raziel. Had you paid
attention, to what was being taught to you by the Librarian. You
would have known
about the troll's ability to regenerate accept when wounded by
fire or heat.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel just glared at the Old Necromancer. His anger rising </p>

<p>&quot;You have much to learn, just be glad you were fortunate
to survive this lesson. Now go
to your quarters&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel left hearing Ashyur's laughter all the way. </p>

<p>------------------- </p>

<p>End Chapter<br>
-------------- </p>

<p>----------------------------- </p>

<p>Chapter 4 A Dish Served Cold<br>
----------------------------- </p>

<p>&quot;What do you want Ashyur?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; I bring orders from the Council, M'lord&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Since when do I listen to the Council? </p>

<p>&quot;Since now. They want you to give Raziel the Tests of
Passing.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I will choose when and who receives the Tests of
Passing, not the Council. Raziel is not
ready.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The Council can overrule you. Your way isn&#146;t
endless. Besides, you and I both know
that he is more then ready. The only problem that could possibly
delay his release, we
cured 4 years ago. You are holding him back, because you fear the
same thing will
happen to him as his mother.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You are about 5 seconds from losing your head
Ashyur.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Struck a nerve, haven&#146;t I? What happened to her
could not have been stopped, just like
your hopes of keeping the boy here. The boy is going to leave one
way or another. His
current little escapades aren&#146;t going to last. And if you
think he is going to find a mate
and settle down, your dumber then you look.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ashyur!!!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;O hush! Just give the boy the damned tests
already!&quot;<br>
------------------------------------- </p>

<p>Raziel yawned and closed the door to the apprentice
necromancer barracks. He started to
head to the Dead Man Drinking Tavern. The skeletal bards were
playing loudly tonight.
Moreover, the patrons were just as loud. </p>

<p>Hey Laolly hey Laly lo<br>
I know a girl from ol nantuck<br>
hey lolly hey lolly lo<br>
Who just loves to..... </p>

<p>A shadow appeared in front of Raziel. </p>

<p>&quot;M'lord Shoudstorm&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel. As soon as you can break from your goal of
copulating with every girl in Paineel,
report to the Council Chambers. You have a task&quot; </p>

<p>The Hell Lord faded away. </p>

<p>A task. Great. What will it be this time? Clean out the
stables or maybe something
prestigious like polishing his boots. Damn him. Raziel faded away<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
&quot;Ahhh Raziel, welcome into the Council Chambers&quot; spoke
a tall elderly man. </p>

<p>&quot;M'lord Seyjuah&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We have a task of importance for you.&quot; A silvery
orb appeared in the center of the
Council. The orb went translucent, and inside six figures
appeared. They were clad in Finely smithed steel armor, polished to a bright shine. </p>

<p>&quot;Paladins..&quot; muttered Raziel </p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Five of them are apprentices; they are on a
training mission. Which by itself is
nothing new or of major importance. However, they have encamped
near the Combine
relics in the forest. Far too close for any ordinary training. It
is believed they are scouting
our defenses for a major attack. Your task is to kill them and
recover any thing that might
give the Purists knowledge of our defenses.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It shall be done.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel saluted the Council and departed for the armory. </p>

<p>This is a test, it has to be..or maybe it is just
coincidence...No! The council chose that
group on purpose. Because they know that the Templar is that
bastard that killed...It
makes no difference..He dies..slowly.<br>
------------------------- </p>

<p>&quot;Do you think Raziel remembers?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I could see it in his eyes, when you showed him the
target&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That is good. Now we must wait and see if he releases
his true power. The power of all
Hell Knights.<br>
------------------------ </p>

<p>He turned the bone key and the elevator rumbled to life. It
began its long descent. </p>

<p>&quot;There you are! You big jerk!&quot; </p>

<p>He turned around to meet the voice and instead met a slap. </p>

<p>&quot;Meya!?! You are supposed to be asleep!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was! But I woke up and you were gone! You big jerk!
Leaving after you have your
way.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Meya...&quot; he gave her his best pitiful look </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#146;t give me that face....stop it...o...all right.
I forgive you. Were are you going so
late?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Council&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;O my. Be careful Raziel. You come back unhurt, or
else.&quot; She kissed him.<br>
------------------------------------- </p>

<p>Raziel perched on top of the Combine relic peering into the
camp. Most were practicing
some sword skills, but he was not concerned with them. His gaze
was locked onto the
Templar. He was showing one of the Apprentices some magic
techniques on a hapless
Kobold. He waited and waited. His hatred boiling. He could not
stand it any longer. </p>

<p>&quot;No..no. You&#146;re raising your arm too high for your
swing to be effective. Do it like this&quot;
The Templar exampled </p>

<p>&quot;O. Thank you. M'lord Arudan&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Not a problem. Hey! Who put out the fire?&quot; spoke
Arudan. A cool wind rushed through
the camp. </p>

<p>A laugh echoed. </p>

<p>&quot;What the hell?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You, Purists amaze me. You claim to allow only the pure
of heart and the noble into your
ranks, yet dogs like you Templar, swell the ranks.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I suggest you watch your tongue. Lest you feel my cold
steel!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hah! Could you defeat me? You can only defeat the weak
and defenseless.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What!?!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#146;t deny it. 14 years ago, you cut a woman down
who merely tried to protect her
child. No doubt given the chance you would have killed the child
had he not escaped.&quot; \ </p>

<p>&quot;I killed no woman 14 years ago. I killed the demon spawn
of Innorouk!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;SILENCE!!!!!&quot; A figure in chain mail appeared in
the center of the camp. &quot;Now you dog,
Revenge shall be mine&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So the child has grown, it is a shame you have followed
the ways of the Heretics. My
students kill this follower of darkness. Show him the light of
Elrossi!!&quot; </p>

<p>The five Apprentices circled Raziel. &quot;I have no interest
in you. If you value your life, flee
to Erudin&quot; They ignored him and charged. </p>

<p>ONE!!! &quot;GWAAAAH!! </p>

<p>TWO!!! 'DAAAAH!&quot; </p>

<p>THREE!!! &quot;AAAAAAH!&quot; </p>

<p>FOUR!!! &quot;GWAAARAAAA&quot; </p>

<p>AND FIVE!!! &quot;AAAARGG&quot; </p>

<p>The bodies crashed to the ground. </p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn&#146;t even count that as sword practice. It&#146;s
your turn Templar.&quot; </p>

<p>Arudan made a quick prayer for the souls of his students.
* He with drew his sword. The blade began to glow as mana began
to flow to the holy
blade. Raziel disappeared. The Templar turned around thinking he
would reappear behind
him. He felt his blood flow as pain ripped through his back. Then
again in on his side..then
once again in his chest. &quot;Damn you Heretic!!&quot; he
quickly raised his blade &quot;Elrossi impart my
blade your Holy Light!&quot; The blade shined brightly. The
shadows quickly departed the
camp. Raziel faded into view as the light ran over him. &quot;Now
try hiding your shadows, Heretic.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I need no shadows to defeat you.&quot; Raziel's hands
glowed briefly. Arudan screamed as his
armor heated and burned his skin. &quot;How does it feel,
Templar. How does it the pain you
caused return onto you&quot; </p>

<p>The Templar out of pain dropped his blade. The glowing light
disappeared and shadows
reclaimed the land. Raziel disappeared again. Arudan dropped to
the ground has Raziel's
blade cut the back of his knees. Raziel appeared in front of
Arudan. And sent his sword
threw him. He slowly with drew the blade and cast it aside. * </p>

<p>Arudan crashed to the ground. Still gasping for a few breaths
of air to pray. &quot;O great..el
rossi..please..protect my us...please guide our souls..to
you...r.....embrace&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel bent down and grasped Arudan by the neck. &quot;Do not
worry Templar, your soul shall
not depart this realm.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wha....&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel's eye went white. &quot;Your soul... is mine!&quot; </p>

<p>His scream echoed through Toxxulia. </p>
