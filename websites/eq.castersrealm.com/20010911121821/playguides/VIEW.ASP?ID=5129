  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p><b>So, you want to be a Shadow Knight, eh, whelp?</b><br>
 <br>
Before all else, stripling, you must understand what we are.<br> 
 <br>
We are half necromancer, half warrior. Having spent time working on both the body and the mind, we are not as strong in each as our counterparts, however, the combination of the two may be far more powerful than either of them alone.<br>
 <br>
We receive a skeleton pet. However, this pet will never be more than half your level, often much lower... Until level 58. The vast majority of our pets serve two purposes: First, it's a DoT you only have to cast when it dies. Second, it's great for giving a party that extra 5 seconds of 'Run away, run away' time.. This all changes with the 49 pets, which begin to duel wield, have enough hit points to take a few lickings and keep on ticking.. The level 58 pet, which is the 44 necro spell, summons what is considered to be one of the very best necro pets, and is capable of doing things like lifetapping and camping upper guk, all on its very own. <br>
<br>
We receive Lifetaps. These aren't really used as heals until the highest levels, mmm... Drain Soul... as they simply don't take enough life from the enemy. They are best used so that the healer of the party has the time to heal the fragile caster before she's forced to deal with you. <br>
<br>
We receive DoTs. Much like the pet, they are severely under level. They won't really do noticeable damage to a mob your own level, again, until the very highest levels. However, even at the lower levels, they are a marvelous set of tools, accomplishing exactly what we do better than anyone else in the game.. Creating Hatred. Often, this is accomplished best through our ability to place more than one line of these spells upon a creature, with up to four lines available to us as we progress, including Disease, Heat, Darkness, and Magic/Debuff. <br>
<br>
Again, at the higher levels, we begin to gain the ability to buff our attack and AC ratings directly, draining the strength and toughness from our enemies. Even in the lower levels, a Shadow Knight is one of the few melee types that can be expected to solo effectively, with the ability to both snare(Darkness) and Fear. While it certainly can be messy, it is more reliable than root/heal. These spells will also anger your opponent greatly, causing it to focus its rage upon you. <br>
<br>
Unlike the paladin or warrior, we are built for stealth as well, as much so as the necro or the enchanter. With a short casting self-invis, and invis to undead, we can get places with an ease that other melee classes(excepting the rogue) can only dream of.<br>
 <br>
Though the Unholy Armor that we may wear is often weaker than the powerfully enchanted metals that a warrior is wrapped in, we may match him completely in defensive skill, and with our powerful taunting abilities, are often a far superior choice to such a chance dependant creature. Unfortuately, our raw skill and fury with our weapons lags far behind that of the unwashed berzerker, yet the honor that we must keep in the eyes of our God is a slight price to pay for the greater glory and favor of the Father. <br>
<br>
We are given the power to call upon the aura of our Lord and Master once per day, wreaking massive damage upon a singe foe. Both the pain and the hatred created by this attack cannot be ignored, and you would do well to remember that while it will rarely slay even a weakened foe, it is still a valuable addition to our powers, no less so than the paladin's channeling of their own puny Masters.<br>
 <br>
And then, there is the last important ability of a Shadow Knight. At level 30, we gain the spell Feign Death. This spell has a great many uses, and once it is gained, it is almost never unmemorized. <br>
<br>
However, for all this power and glory at the end or our lives, we have to battle our way up a very steep path, whose rewards can only be grasped at the end. The worth of a Knight is entirely dependant upon the skill of the person behind it: A well played, well geared Knight is a god of death capable of wreaking havoc anywhere, anywhen, with help or without. A competent Knight will bring a great deal of power to a group, his tanking and taunting ability almost unrivaled. For what good is it to be wrapped in the finest of armors if there are none who will bother assaulting it? Yet, an incompetent Knight is the first to die, tangled in his own web of magic and steel, unable to manipulate the threads of death.  <br>
 <br>
In summary, the path of a Shadow Knight is as harsh and cruel as the man or woman that walks it, but the rewards at the end of that path are very great indeed. <br>
 <br>
How then, may you be best prepared to take your first steps upon this path? You have a limited chance to set your abilities at the beginning of your Knighthood, and there are four Areas of concern to us as Knights.<br>
 <br>
Strength. This statistic governs your ability to bear your armor and weapons, as well as the equipment of the deceased enemy. It also helps to determine the maximum damage you may bring to bear on an enemy. This is a good place to put left over points, rather than being considered the be all and end all. Ogres and Trolls have little use for more of this, but an Elf, Erudite, or Human will desire more, possibly an Iksar as well. It is also one of the easiest stats to augment with gear.<br>
 <br>
Stamina. This determines how long you can swing a sword, swim an ocean, leap like a frog. It will also affect the amount of pain that you can bear before falling unconcious, or dying like a weakling High Elf. This is a good place to put points for a Dark Elf, Human, Erudite, or Iksar.<br>
 <br>
Agility. The nimbleness of your body, it affects to some small degree your ability to defend against an enemy's blade. Once this has reached the value of a human's basic agility, there is little point in expanding it further, as the law of diminishing returns takes effect. Dark Elves should never raise this, while a Troll or Ogre may wish to consider it. <br>
 <br>
Intelligence. The nimbleness of your mind, this statistic determines not only how swifty you may learn a skill, but also how much mana you have to call upon to power the blessings of the dark magics of a necromancer. A troll, ogre, or human would do well to increase this. <br>
 <br>
It is also said that a low charisma may increase the effects of the fear spells, so this statistic should also not be increased. <br>
 <br>
If you would begin your career with equipment beyond that provided by your mortal lord, the following suits of armor are often useful to a young knight. <br>
 <br>
Banded and Bronze are cheap, and easy to obtain, offering more than suffecient protection during the youth of a knight.<br>
 <br>
Darkforge armor is the armor of a knight who has obtained some status, and while this may be purchased and given to a young knight, the skills and paitence learned in the hunt for that armor are vastly appreciated, and it is recommended that a knight do his own questing for this hell forged steel. <br>
 <br>
Ry'gorr chainmail is now a valid choice, offering protection similiar to that provided by Darkforge, as well as being somewhat easier to obtain. <br>
 <br>
Finally, a young knight may be provided with sentient armor, which while very heavy, grants intelligence as well as protection of a caliber similiar to Darkforge and Ry'Gorr.<br>
 <br>
There is a vast selection of weapons available to the young knight as well, ranging from simple fine steel, to the comparatvely expensive and mighty Mace of the Shadowed Soul. <br>
 <br>
Yet, in any case, simply possessing powerful equipment is not enough, you must also become familiar with the useage and coaxing of our somewhat awkward spell book, as well as a myriad of other skills that can only be learned through the experience of playing. It takes a swift and experienced mind to be a master knight...<br>
 <br>
Good luck to you on the path of Darkness, young knight, and may the Lords of Hate, Terror, and Disease look over you in your struggle against the Light. <br></p>
