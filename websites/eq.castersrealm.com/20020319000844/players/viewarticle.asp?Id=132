SOTV is finally here!! you may now praise me <img border="0" src="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15">.
One little note before you start enjoying, as always there music cues in SOTV.
but you may notice that most them can be found on either WWF: The Music Volume 5
or WWF Tough Enough: Trax Unleashed. I just want to assure you that it is purely
concidental and I was not paid $5,000 for the shameless advertising....maybe <img border="0" src="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15">(But
you'll never know for sure, now will you <img border="0" src="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/tongue.gif" width="15" height="15">)
<p>So without further ado... It's story time!!!<br>
-----------------------
<p>For almost 500 years , I have watched Norrath changed, blossom and decay.
Nations rise and fall...teachings are learned and forgotten. Unfortunately the
latter happened to what my beloved tried to show to the world. The truth behind
all things fell upon deaf ears...the 'gods' sway has gone undiminished...but
like all things. They changed. Through our offspring, the truth is starting to
be spread once again. Maybe this generation can finally convince Norrath...or
maybe it will fall tot eh wayside once again..maybe...regardless of what
happens, the winds of change are blowing was once again and Norrath will never
be the same.<br>
--------------------
<p>Kyt hated the underground caverns, they stunk like the pits of hell and were
as dark as pitch.
<p>|Why don't they ever clean these damn caverns?|
<p>I have no idea Mika. You would think they would a city, A capital city, no
less as rich as Palsa could pay some one to clean it.
<p>|Beauracrats..|
<p>No kidding<br>
<br>
|Kyt..slow down a bit, I don't like this he has to be around here somewhere.|
<p>Can't you sense his familiar?
<p>|No..That scares me...I should be able to sense familiars|
<p>I hate to admit it, but this is scaring me too..I almost wish that I had
waited a bit..|
<p>|Big bad Kyt? scared? I'm shocked. Don't worry, You will do just fine, your
more then ready to become th- DUCK!!!!|
<p>Kyt ducked at her familiar’s advice just a chain shot out of the shadows
and sailed over her. She then rolled to the right, withdrawing her scimitar. A
blue wolf appeared behind her running at high speed, it leapt and just as it was
about to land on her back, it shimmered and in a flash of darkness, it was gone,
and upon Kyt was suit of blue spiked armor.
<p>Her breath drew short, as her eyes darted from side to side, trying to pierce
the darkness searching for her target.
<p>|Calm down, Kyt, if your heart starts beating any faster and harder, you'll
rattle off your armor.|
<p>You would like that wouldn't you?
<p>| I refrain to answer that..it might incriminate me..|
<p>She smiled, but the smile faded as she noticed her that her breath was
becoming visible, the mist hanging in the air because of the cold.
<p>He's close.
<p>|Your armor is rattling...|
<p>I'm scared.......I'm not ready for this!!!!
<p>&quot;Too late to run now&quot; Spoke a deep voice behind her. She wheeled
around, swinging her scimitar at the voice, it exploded as it touched a fiery
red cloak. She gasped then cried out, as two chains arced out of the shadows and
collided with her armor, shattering the familiar armor, leaving her in nothing
but her burlap under clothing. Another flash of darkness went off, catapulting
her backwards flying through the air.
<p>|KYT!!!|
<p>Four more chains harpooned out the darkness, each of the chains buried
themselves into her wrists and ankles, then hoisted her up off the ground,
spread eagling her.
<p>A cold, deep voice laugh crept out of the darkness, a tall shape stepped out.
The majority of the figure couldn't be made out by the pain wracked girl, but
she could very clearing make out the fiery cape and cowl.
<p>Mika....Help me!!!!!
<p>The blue wolf, appearing at her side, charged the tall figure. The wolf leapt
it's teeth bared, and was shredded by a barrage of chains through it's body. The
mutilated body crashed tot he ground, just barely alive.
<p>|Kyt...I'm sorry.....I've failed y-|
<p>The wolf howled as it exploded into flames.
<p>MIKA! Mika!! Answer me!!!!!!!!! Say something!!!!!!!!!!
<p>The figure laughed again.
<p>&quot;Your familiar is gone girl, as you will be. But you will not be so
fortunate as it. I intend on savoring your soul.&quot;
<p>&quot;YOU..bas... I'll kill you!!!&quot;
<p>The figure responded with several lashes from his shadow chains, they bit
into her flesh making her scream in pain. Another barrage tore off some of her
flesh and what little clothing she had left on.
<p>The figure smiled. He moved up to her, and with his hand clutched her face.
<p>&quot;Such beauty.I shall savor every moment of ecstasy, every second of
exquisite pain.&quot; to make his point, the chains began to retract slowly.
<p>She screamed and then spat into his face. &quot;Do you what want!! You and I
both know that you aren't a true Hell Lord!! You may have beaten me!! But you
will always be a Mal'shak!! You never could claim the title!!! You could never
beat -&quot;
<p>The figure's eyes flashed with anger and the chains penetrating her body,
glowed white hot, eliciting another scream for Kyt. Another chain leapt out of
the darkness and smashed into her, feeling like she had been punched hard in the
left shoulder. The other chains vacated her body and she slumped to the floor.
When she made to get up, she gasped..but she couldn't scream any more...her
arm...her left arm was gone..only a constant spurt of blood.
<p>The figure began to talk..but not to her..Just to the darkness as if some one
else was there.
<p><br>
&quot;You robbed me of my destiny..My chance to go to Jahorn...&quot; A spiked
chain shot out and pierced through Kyt's neck and out of the other side, it
retracted slight and she felt barbs at the back of her head as she grasped in
disbelief at the chain in front of her, buried in her neck.
<p>&quot;But I can feel you out there..taunting me...I can feel your
power....Every moment. you grow stronger....as do I....soon...we shall
meet...and I shall claim my birth right....&quot;
<p>The chain retreated back into the darkness. Kyt felt no pain... she tumbled
forward, finding her self looking at the feet of the figure....the Hell Lord of
Palsa, Maxim..as he walked off into the shadows, she heard another thump..and
something fell into her view...her twitching headless body.
<p>Just the last light faded from her, she heard one last word.
<p>&quot;.....Raziel.&quot;<br>
-----------------------------------
<p>A black crescent wave carved the air and into a dozen undead which where
immediately disintegrated. But even more took up the fallen's place, all the
while still moaning from eternal agony.
<p>&quot;Dread.....Dread.....Join us.......Dread!!!!!!!!&quot;
<p>The zombies continued up the hill, pushing through the onslaught undaunted
until they came upon an invisible barrier. The zombies howled in pain as the
barrier scorched them. On the other side of barrier, a cloaked figure approached
the howling zombies, extending an arm. Black hot flames ignited on his arm and a
beamed pulsed out destroying the mob of zombies pressed against the barrier.
<p>The shrouded figure, stepped through to the other side of the barrier into
the large gap in the mob of zombies. The zombies closed in encircling the
figure, but then suddenly they stopped and didn't close in any further. The
figure looked around searching for someone or something. Obviously getting
agitated, the figure pulled back the hood of the cloak, revealing a black
skinned elf.
<p>&quot;I tire of this Dread King!!! Show yourself!!&quot;
<p>The zombies encircling the black elf, began to speak, but instead of the
normal moan and chants, they began to speak as one, in a cold almost distant
voice.
<p>&quot;Try as... you might Dirk..... You will never..... be able to hold.....
me back forever...&quot;
<p>&quot;That remains to be seen! You have been trying for 18 years
unsuccessfully! You will never enter the temple.&quot;
<p>&quot;...maybe so...but I need not...enter the ruins..to complete my
goal......and even Tunare's.....last wish...will not protect..this mountain
forever...soon...soon....Dirk Lunas.....&quot;
<p>&quot;Hmph. You are over confident. You will never pierce the barrier. You
are too weak. I and others have beaten countless times before and will continue
to do so.&quot;
<p>The zombies began to laugh, even Dirk had to shudder at the sound of
unnatural sound of thousands of undead laughing as one.
<p>&quot;My corporeal form may be destroyed....but I will always return...but
even so....my new form....will be able to contain...all of my power......not
just a token...like Veeshan’s gift......&quot;
<p>&quot;New form?&quot;
<p>&quot;In all this time..you do not understand....&quot;
<p>The zombies began to laugh again.
<p>&quot;Soon.....the child's soul and corporeal bind...will belong..to me..just
....as the soul and corporeal bind of the..... mother belongs to Palsa......&quot;
<p>&quot;NEVER!!!&quot;
<p>The ground surrounding Dirk crackled and then detonated incinerating
everything within a quarter mile forward of the barrier. Even with the zombies
gone, the voice of the Dread King still spoke.
<p>&quot;Soon...you will see.....Dirk........Lunas.......&quot;
<p><br>
Then the voice went silent, and the hairs on the back of Dirk's head stopped
standing on end, indicating the retreat of the Dread King's influence. He
shuddered slightly, then turned around and passed back through the barrier. as
he walked back up the mountain in the ButcherBlock range, to Tunare's forgotten
temple, his thoughts began to drift..
<p>Jesica....I miss you so much..When I have fulfilled my promise...I will
avenge you...I will not rest until I have his -
<p>&quot;Papa! Papa!!!&quot; A small girl appeared out of the temple, and dashed
down to greet Dirk. The girl was met with open arms and scooped and lifted into
the air.
<p>&quot;Whee!!!!&quot; she cheered as Dirk twirled around a bit with a large
smile Slowing down to a stop, he brought her to his chest and the girl gave him
a tight hug around the neck.
<p>&quot;ack..not so tight Trini.&quot; He said feigning ..slightly
<p>&quot;Sorry.&quot;
<p>&quot;Trini what are you doing up here, you know you aren't supposed to come
up here when the zombies approach the temple.&quot;
<p>&quot;I know..but the barrier never lets them through..and even if they did
your so strong Papa!!&quot; She said with big eyes swelled with adoration.
<p>&quot;Yes, I am..but just the same, I don't want you up here when they
approach. you're all I have left in the world Trini. now promise me you won't
come up here again when the zombies appear.&quot;
<p>&quot; I prom-&quot; Suddenly she shrieked and began to tremble..A cold wave
passed over Dirk..he could feel what Trini was feeling. Power...raw unequaled ,
indescribable power..
<p>&quot;Papa!! What is it!?!&quot; Trini said between a combination of shakes
and tears.&quot;
<p>&quot;I can feel it..A storm.... it's coming.&quot;

(Music Cue| Smackdown: WWF The Music Volume 5)
<p>Gnomish fireworks sail into the air and explode to the cheers of hundreds of
people and blaring music, illuminating the sky.
<p>{Welcome to Sunday Night Gladiators!!!, 1 mile above the Oasis of Marr in the
largest floating arena in Norrath!!!!!! Hi I am Dayn Owens and to my right is,

<p>A large muscular human, enters the massive arena pyrotechnics going off
behind him. He raises his arms in celebration, driving the group into greater
heights of hysterics
<p>{I like Co Slate, but personally I think he is way over his head. No one has

<p>{And because of the amount of neuro-connection to provide maximum amount of

<p>{Married Man...Happy, Happy married man!}
<p>An armored figure steps out, the arena lights up as countless flashes of
cameras goes of, shining brightly off the light blue, form fighting hard suit of
Aquamarine. The crowd goes insane, as two panels at the shoulder blades of the
hard suit open up, jutting out 90 degrees. Aqua marine crouches, an immense
flare shoots out of the panels , propelling Aquamarine forward into a breakneck
dash down the ramp.. The thruster then suddenly cut out, she falls forward into
a several twisting hand springs forward. On the last hand spring, she pushes up,
and rights her self, the thrusters kick in again, and she connects to Slate with
a tremendous Arial whirlwind kind.
<p>(End Music Cue)<br>
--------------------------
<p>Wow, Aquamarine is tough.
<p>|She's ok.|
<p>Like to see you do that.
<p>|Fat chance.|
<p>Thought so old man
<p>|I may be old but I can still kick your butt!!!|
<p>I am so scared..I quake at the thought of you batting me with your paw.|
<p>|You know in my day, people actually respected their grandpa.|
<p>Tough noogies
<p>With the last remark, Reyas batted the young boy in the head with his paw.
<p>&quot;ow!&quot;
<p>|You deserve it. Now do you want to pay off the airship or not?&quot;
<p>Of course...though I don't see why I have to do the hard part? it's your
fault that it broke in the first place.
<p>|It is not!!! I was just walking there!! Even if it was my fault...which it
is not. You don't expect your poor old Granpa to do hard labor now do you?|
<p>Oh so now you are old and wornout?
<p>|O yes..O my back...O ah..ee oi! How does that sound?|
<p>Hmph!
<p>|Being more then several millennia old has it's benefits|
<p>So I am learning...Alright..I'l go get ready. You go place the bet. And no
stopping at the Casino this time!!
<p>|You have no faith in me Nall...sniff.....|
<p>You better believe it! Now promise!!
<p>|Alright I promise I won’t stop at the Casino.|
<p>And...
<p>|..the bar..|
<p>And!!!
<p>|...the Hall of Scantily Clad Elves....Man! you are no fun.| With a sigh, the
silver winged cat Reyas, hopped off the Nall's shoulder and disappeared around
the corner.<br>
---------------------------
<p>A door chirps.
<p>&quot;Enter.&quot;
<p>A gnome holding a data assistant pad, enters the dark room and stands in
front of a large oak desk, staring at the back of the chair of the Director of
En-gen. A small puff of smoke drifts up from behind the chair. A flash of
lightning goes off, illuminating the dark room.
<p>&quot;Could this be any more of a cliche? You have to much free time
boss.&quot;
<p>The man in the chair laughed, then thumbed a button on his chair. The room
illuminated, the tv in front of him disappears into the ceiling, the smoke
generator on the top of chair, retracted into the chair, and the chair it self
shurnk down to 3/4 it's previous size as does the table. The chair swings around
to face the gnome holding the D.A.P, revealing a Halfling.
<p>&quot;So what do you have to report to me Shamus?&quot;
<p>&quot;Well, we have run into a lot of snags sir.&quot;
<p>&quot;What type of snags?&quot;
<p>&quot;Unfortunately. A majority of the targets for the Next-Generation
Special Forces Ghost program and Lilith, have proved either unattainable or
decayed beyond use.&quot;
<p>&quot;Explain.&quot;
<p>The gnome sighed deeply. &quot;Prepare for a mouthful.&quot;
<p>&quot;We have nothing but time Shamus.&quot;
<p>&quot;I'll start with target Number 1. Dirk Lunas. Display on.&quot;
<p>A laser projection hovers in midair, it showed an array of symbols and
numbers and in the center a picture of Dirk, then it switched to an aerial view
of Faydwer.
<p>&quot;We dispatched a lance of troops to physically acquire a sample, but
they where totally anniallated and turned by the undead. They never even got
close, only about 500 feet into the continent.&quot;
<p>&quot;Why were physical troops dispatched? Why no the drones?&quot;
<p>&quot;They couldn't get close.&quot;
<p>The aeriel view zoomed into the ButcherBlock mountains, then into some temple
ruins.
<p>&quot;Dirk Lunas.He has been sighted by our aeriel surveillance units to live
here, but unfortunately, there is some kind of barrier protecting the temple
from the undead and the Dread King. Whatever it is, it has been destroying our
drones, and the few times he actually leaves the barrier, his MT aura destroys
the drones as well. It's a losing situation.&quot;
<p>&quot;So he's out of the picture. What about 2?&quot;
<p>&quot;Same reason, except the child never leaves the barrier.&quot;
<p>&quot;3?&quot;
<p>The projection shifted, revealing a picture of young Erudite.
<p>&quot;Raziel Eom'brn.We haven't been able to find him or a body. which is
disappointing because from what we have been able to extract from texts. He
would have been a valuable addition. But he just seemed to disappear off the
face of Norrath after the destruction of Erudin.&quot;
<p>&quot;4?&quot;
<p>&quot;Unlike the that range in the Butcherblock mountains, there was no
barrier around the ruins of Old Felwithe. but when the drones searched the
burial tomb. There where no remains. So either they where moved with the flight
or they where turned by the dread King.&quot;
<p>&quot;5?&quot;
<p>The projection switched to a figure shrouded into a fiery cloak.
<p>&quot;Maxim Tidias. The current Hell Lord of Palsa, we where able to obtain a
sample from him. it was actually quite easy, we didn’t even have to send a
drone near him to get it. we has some interesting..to say the least..rituals....which
inflicts upon himself everyday..like this&quot;
<p>&quot;Spare me the details. What have you extrapolated?&quot;
<p>&quot;His MTA levels are well beyond anything we have ever seen. His markers
are a perfect addition to the Ghosts and Lilith.&quot;
<p>&quot;Very good.&quot;
<p>&quot;There is one thing you should know about his rituals.&quot;
<p>&quot;yes?&quot;
<p>&quot;Well, I won't bore you with the details. But what it entails is the
maintenance of a corpse.&quot;
<p>&quot;So?&quot;
<p>&quot;The drone was able to extract some samples of Dirk from the
corpse.&quot;
<p>&quot;Really? What was extrapolated?&quot;
<p>&quot;Not much. Unfortunately, whatever preservation techniques Maxim is
using. It didn’t preserve the sample very well. 97% of it was decayed beyond
recognition. The rest that was decodable was pretty much junk.&quot;
<p>&quot;&quot;So aside from the Hell Lord, do we have any good materiel for the
projects?&quot;
<p>&quot;Well there is one thing. It does have a lot of promise.&quot;
<p>The projection shifted once again, this time to the cast of Sunday Night
Gladiators. The projection then zooms in on the entry ramp as Nall enters,
pyrotechnics going off behind him. Shamus made a quick adjustment, muting the
sound, as the music was blaring quite loudly.
<p>&quot;When we did the 'steroid testing' for this young apparent half-elf,like
we do all the athletes. We came upon something interesting.&quot;
<p>&quot;Which is?&quot;
<p>&quot;Well. 75% of his profile is elven, and of that, there is nothing truly
special. but the last 25% is a type in which we have never encountered before.
And what ever it is, its potential is unbelievable.&quot;
<p>&quot;Any speculations?&quot;
<p>&quot;Not really, after combing the database, there isn’t a single thing
that even comes close to matching the profile.. But if we to take a clue from
the his fighting name and the fact that he has wings...&quot;
<p>&quot;Quite stalling!!&quot;
<p>&quot;It may be a dragon profile.&quot;
<p>&quot;Dragon!?!&quot;
<p>&quot;yes. But this is pure speculation, but from what we know fro old texts,
it may be well possible. And&quot;
<p>The projection shifted to a security camera. At first the screen was filled
with an assortment of scantily clad and bare elven women dancing to strobe
lights and unheard music. The camera then zoomed in on one of the women doing a
table dance, then the camera panned down to the table top. On the table was a
silver winged cat.
<p>&quot; What is that?&quot;
<p>&quot;this is purely speculation but, seeing how that cat or whatever it is,
is almost always hanging around the boy, and what little we have from texts.
It's possible that, the frisky kitten on the screen may be an ancestor, in
essence a full fledged dragon..in a reduced form obviously.&quot;
<p>&quot;My, my. Things are looking up. Get another sample of the boy, and try
to capture or get at least get sample of that..whatever it is.&quot;
<p>&quot;Yes,sir&quot;
<p>Shamus had the display, wink out and moved to exit the office.
<p>&quot;Shamus, one more thing. How goes the progress in claiming the 'item'
for Lilith?&quot;
<p>&quot;Unsuccessful sir. Negotiations with the Selvatorian government have
been halted and fruitless. We had planning on dispatching the Ghosts, to acquire
it by force.&quot;
<p>&quot;Keep that has a back up plan, I have an idea. Lets see just how potent
the boy's dragon side is...&quot;
<p>---------------------------------
<p>|Bet's placed Nall. Remember the plan.|
<p>I know! Why are you reminding me? It was my idea.....minus the part in which
I get beat up....
<p>|Well, it's what happens when you break your airship.|
<p>You broke the airship!!!
<p>|Details..Details.|
<p>So what are the odds at the moment?
<p>|5-2 favor of Magus.|
<p>That's definatly no going to cover the repairs..
<p>|No kidding, your going to have to fake it till at least 10.|
<p>Man....here we go. Magus is heading in..
<p>(Music Cue: Dragula: Rob Zombie)
<p>{And here comes one half of the Demolition squad. Magus Shenron!!}
<p>A large 8 foot, very ugly human enters the ring. Pyrotechnics go off in the
arena, the smoke trails, creating a large M. The crowd is in hysterics.
<p>{Man. Magus is one powerful guy, but man is he ugly. he's got a face that
even a mother couldn't love! But that what's happened when your mom is a Troll}
<p>{Hey, Now that isn't right. Insult the wrestlers, but leave family out of
it.}
<p>{I wasn't insulting his mom, she really is a Troll, his dad his human, his
mom is a troll.}
<p>{You mean..someone actually.....eeewwww...}
<p>Magus continues on down the entrance ramp arms high.
<p><br>
{Any way, SNG is brought to you tonight by. ....Gnome and Becker!! The designers
of the worlds best home appliances. &quot;When you want quality, get a
Gnome!!&quot;}
<p>{...eeeeww....images burned into my mind....eeew.....argh!!}

<p><br>
{sorry...You know I have a weak stomach, you shouldn't tell me things like
that.}
<p>(End Music)
<p>(Music Cue: Fat Lip by SUM 41)
<p>{and here comes the new kid who has been lighting things up over the last
week. Nall Tayus aka... KID DRACO!!!}
<p><br>
Nall enters from behind a black curtain, gingerly. He turns around briefly
shaking his rear at the crowd, eliciting cheers from the women in the audience.
He then leaps into the air turning back to face the crowd, with an arm raised in
triumph he shots.
<p>&quot;BAM!!&quot;
<p>Pyro ignites briefly obscuring him then begins to ignite in stages going down
the ramp entry ramp. As the pyro begins to cycle back up the sides of the ramp,
Nall lands flexes eliciting more cheers from the women in the audience and
starts down toward the arena.
<p>| Remember, let him have the advantage, but not to much or they will put a
hold on the betting odds.|
<p>Yeah. Yeah.
<p>A gong sounds as Nall was at the bottom of the ramp flicking the bang of red
hair on his forehead, driving the women wild.
<p>What was that ?
<p>|The start gong|
<p>Oh....CR-
<p><br>
&quot;YOUR MINE KID!!!!&quot; Magus shouts as scoops Nall in a bear hug and
begins to squeeze.
<p>{Oh man!! Magus has got the kid in his infamous hug of bone cracking!!}
<p>{I guess he should have spent less time showing off and a little more time
paying attention on what Magus was doing. I say this Kid has is behind 6-1 at
the moment.}
<p>{I'd have to agree.. Oh Look!! The Kid has broke loose!! Alright kid!!! Hey
why is he beginning to glow?}
<p>{Looks like the Kid is warming up! So far as we have seen in the last week,
he really hates to get in close in these fights. He prefers to take his
opponents down with mana based attacks. But think for a minute that he can't
fight close up.}
<p><br>
Nall begins to glow fiercely as mana begins to gather around him. Suddenly he
the mana flows stops and he with his fist he strikes the arena floor.
<p>&quot;MANA WAVE!!!!!!!&quot; A blue wave of energy erupts and streaks toward
Magus. Magus glows yellow briefly then unleashes his own mana attack.
<p>&quot;GROUND QUAKER!!!&quot;
<p>The swell of yellow mana collides and then consumes Nall's attack and before
Nall could react the swell consumed him, singing him and burning some of his
clothes. For an interminable time, Nall was in pain. That was all that existed
pain...endless pain...then it was gone. He could see somewhat, but the smoke
from his burnt clothes stung his eyes. He could barely make out the lumbering
form of Magus coming toward him. The shape got closer and closer.. then he felt
the air leave his lungs, a fist was buried deep in his stomach, then in his
face, then nothing once again. He could feel air rush past him, that weird
weightless feeling of flight...then he cried out once again as he found himself
slamming into the crowd protection shield. The stinging of the shields energy
snapped him to full consciousness.
<p>Oh that hurt...How are the odds Granpa?
<p>|Those can't be real! |
<p>Huh? Of course this fight is real. Don't be silly. How are the odds? Can I
beat this guy yet?
<p>|They are!...... So soft..........|
<p>Huh.........GRANPA!!!!
<p>|?? Nall??? oops...I should pay attention to what I think|
<p>YOU PROMISED!!
<p>|I did no such thing|
<p>You promised just before you placed the bet!! You did place the bet didn't
you!?!
<p>|Yes, I placed the bet!! And I said I would not go to the Casino, Bar or Hall
of Scantily Clad Elves...I made no such promise about the Hall of Bare Nekkid
Elves.|
<p>O for crying outloud!!!! YOU-You old horny dragon!! Would you just pay
attention to the betting odds!
<p>|Alright Alirght..sheesh...And I am not old!!!|<br>
---------------------
<p>A thousand years away, buried deep beneath the surface of Norrath. A
consciousness awakens for the first time. For the first time it begins to look
out, searching.....just to explore the world around it. For a millennia the
consciousness spread out understanding it's environment and itself. Only as the
things came into perspective did the consciousness realize that it was alive,
and what it was. As it turned inward and explored the surrounding of skin and
sinew that held it to this plane, it looked at every par t of the form.
Exploring and pondering every inch, every hair, every finger, every
leg...Everything in its entirety. It pondered each part and understood each part
so thoroughly , that it became them. and for the first time it looked upon its
world through its eyes.
<p>At first everything was blurry, then slowly came into view. The world was
soft...almost......like a liquid.... yes that seemed to be the right word, the
mind decided. The eyes looked upon more of its surroundings, it saw some shapes
a few inches from it. It focused on the shapes and read them with much
happiness. A flush of elation ran through it, it was it's first word.
<p><br>
LILITH
<p>The mind thought upon the word with happiness. It liked the word. It was
nice. It decided to call itself that. Lilith. That was nice. As it pondered the
word even more, it noticed some movement just beyond the floating word.. Lilith
focused in on the movement, the moving shape came into focus. It was short.it
had hands....legs...a robe.robe seemed like the right word...it was a
gnome...That is what those little things where called. The Gnome wearing the
robe was cheering about something..something else that was moving around.....a
stereo tub..In the tub was the figure of....a boy...with snow white hair except
for this red sliver of hair running across his forehead. The boy seemed to be
fighting.... he seemed so strong..yet..he was holding back...Lilith couldn’t
figure out why.....but she didn't ponder it too much. For some reason, she liked
looking at him....it puzzled her why ..she felt so...different..she felt giddy
and excited...
<p>She her body and reached out searching for the boy. She wanted him she was so
happy..so happy..happy happy happy PAIN!! FRIGHT!! LOSS!!!! ABANDONMENT!!!
<p>*Release....... me.....*
<p>Go away!!!
<p>*Release ......me.......Release....... me...nooooow*
<p>Who are you? Get out of my mind!!!!!
<p>*Release.... me..Lilith!!......Release me...from prison....from Luclin...........*
<p>Leave me alone!!!!!!!
<p>*Release me!!!! *
<p>I'll release you!!! Anything you want Just get of my mind!!!!! So scared...I
cant see...I'm blind.....l-
<p>*-ost.....alone.....you are me.. and I am you...Lilith....release me..from
the false god's prison.....release me...*
<p>How....
<p>*keys....5......................Veeshan.....Cazic-Thule .....Tunare........
...Errolisi..... .........Bristlebane. ..Release....... me......*
<p>The other consciousness left Lilith...Leaving her numb from the
invasion..aside from the lingering remnants of the others emotions.... Lilith
retreated into herself, taking a few centuries to compose herself and prepare
herself to release the other....and maybe find that boy. She giggled for the
first time, she liked the boy. He would be hers. Finally ready she stretched and
took full control of the body of meat and skin.
<p>The computer beside the En-Gen Tech chirped loudly. It screeched, but the
tech was slow as he was still interested in the fight between Nall and Magus. He
had 40 platinum on Magus to win.
<p>&quot;ah Man...&quot; He turned his chair to the noisy computer and stared at
it wide eyed.
<p>&quot;What the? That can't be right!!! There is no way!!! How could the MTA
levels have risen so high!! There's no way! and so quickly!!!! There was barely
enough to register on the system a few minutes ago!! &quot;
<p>The tech went to slap an emergency call button to the Overseer, but he hard a
cracking sound, he turned to the bio tube which held En-Gen's prize work Lilith.
A large crack ran down the polymer tube.
<p>&quot;Oh no..Dear Quellious!&quot; his eyes looked onto the sky blue eyes of
Lilith, entranced...and it was the last he saw as shards of the bio tube sliced
through him.
<p>Lilith ,dripping getting wet from the solution that once held her in stasis,
smiled and stepped out into the new world.<br>
------------------------------------
<p>|10-1 odds Nall. Finish him off.|
<p>Finally!!
<p>As Magus fist swung in , Nall caught it and bent the man's hand back causing
him to scream in pain, then swing with his free hand, which found itself swiftly
in the same predicament as the other. With a light push, Magus sailed across the
arena smashing into Crowd protection shield. Magus slumped down unconscious.
<p>Nall flipped forward to the center of the ring then cheered &quot;ALRIGHT!!!
&quot; The crowd roared...then went silent very quickly.
<p>Hey..wht's up? Why is everyone so silent? I just won... This bites...
<p>|Nall..they are silent because the odds against you winning just jumped 4
points|
<p>Not that I don't mind the extra platinum..but that is kind of silly. I just
won the match why would the odds j-
<p>(Music Cue: Big Show| WWF: the Music Volume 5)
<p>Nall turned around slowly to the entrance ramp, and stood dumbstruck as an
armor clad giant almost 12 feet tall strode inside.
<p>{Uh oh! Looks like things have just turned ugly. Weighing in at over a
quarter ton, it's Magus's partner and the other half of the Demolition squad.
TANK!!!
<p>Tank roared shaking the arena, then lifted his arms and two rockets shot from
his shoulders detonating in midair.
<p>No..no...NO!!! This isn't fair!! This isn't a handicap match!!!!
<p>&quot;YOUR GOING TO GET IT RUNT!!&quot; Tank shouted pointing at the
dumbstruck Nall firing a rocket.
<p>AAHHHH!!!!
<p>Nall leap to the left just missing the rocket.
<p>|Hey. Think of it as more money for fixing the airship|
<p>That you broke!! You should be the one dodging missiles not me!!!
<p>|I did not break the Naked Elf!! I was just in the wrong place at the wrong
time!!! DUCK!!!!|
<p>Two more rockets sailed over Nall's head.
<p>That's it I have had enough of this!!!!
<p>Nall glared intensely at Tank, then let out a yell. his muscles immediately
swelled, ripping his shirt sleeves and pant legs. Exposing the large corded
muscles. Several women in the audience wolf called at him.
<p>As his muscles bulged to their fullest , he tensed ready to strike.
&quot;DRAGON-&quot;
<p>He disappeared from sight. Tank panned around looking for Nall and got more
then he wanted. Nall reappeared in front of Tank in midair. Claws easily
shredding through the 3 inch thick mythril armor. Rending large shards and
shooting sparks everywhere, Nall sunk his fist into the mangled breastplate and
ripped it off exposing the man inside the armor. Nall planted his feet into the
man's chest then disappeared once again.
<p>Reappearing behind the doubled over Tank, mana gathered in Nall's hands he
forced it out upon Tank
<p>&quot;-GENOCIDE!!!&quot; Tank found himself engulfed by a wave of pure
energy, the wave was so forceful it lifted the super heavy man and sent him
flying across the arena, landing not to far from his partner.
<p>{HOLY!!! WOW!! Have you ever seen anything like that? Lets count the hits in
super slo-mo!!! 1...2...10.......Incredible, not counting that massive energy
wave a breathtaking 56 hits all in 4 seconds!!! Unbelievable!!!!!!}
<p>Nall collapse on knee, panting heavily from the expenditure. But the cheers
pf the crowd, got the adrenaline flowing and he got back up to his feet and
waked tot he center of the ring and raised his arms in triumph!
<p>YEAH!!! I RULE!!!!! AND THE 'NEKKID ELF' WILL FLY AGAIN!!!!
<p>&quot;ALRIG-&quot;
<p>&quot;I'M NOT THROUGH WITH YOU YET!!!!&quot;
<p>&quot;What the-&quot; Nall whirled around to see the massive Tank back on his
feet charging toward him
<p>{NO WAY!!!}<br>
|NO WAY!!!|<br>
&quot;NO WAY!!!&quot;
<p>But before Tank could get close a massive beam seemed to come out from no
were and burn a large 5 foot hole between him and Nall.
<p>&quot;Who?&quot;
<p>{Who shot that particle beam?...Look up on the arena spire!!!! It's...
It's!!}
<p>|Aquapurine!!!|
<p>-Marine.
<p>|What ever.|
<p>Standing tall arms folded, balanced on the high reaching spire of the
floating arena was the SNG champion, Aquamarine. Her shoulder canon still
smoking retracted back inside of the hardsuit.
<p>&quot;You!! It's bad enough that a puny little girl is the champion!@!! now
you want to interfere in my match!!! I have had enough you girlie!!!&quot;
shouted Tank &quot;FIRE ALL MISSLES!!&quot;
<p>Tank disappeared in a cloud of smoke as 13 missiles leapt out of various
places of his armor suit and streaked toward Aquamarine.
<p>{What is he doing? Why waste missiles, he can't Aquamarine she's above the
Crowd Protection sh- OH MY GOD!!!! The missiles just went through the shield!!!!
If they hit the spire who knows how many will be hurt or killed!!!!}
<p>The panicked crowds screamed loudly, but it was not because of the thought of
the missiles hitting tall spire , it was out of reaction of an ear piercing
noise emanating from Aquamarine.
<p>GAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!
<p>|WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT!!!!|
<p>The missiles!!! Look the sound is causing them to detonate high and out of
the way. Aquamarine saved the crowd!!!
<p>As the ear piercing screeched died out, Aquamarine somersaulted through the
air and landed in front of Tank. Planting a fist into his faceplate and then an
armored leg into his groin dropping the behemoth.
<p>Nall still somewhat dazed from the sound, watched through the haze as
aquamarine then moonsaulted and dropped down the large hole she caused with her
shoulder canon.
<p>{Hey where is Aquamarine going? Wait a sec....Isn't that area of the floor
above the ..OH NO!!!!!}
<p>Aquamarine reappeared out of the hole carrying three very large jingling
sacks. Turning toward the dazed Nall, she lifted her Visor showing her face to
him.
<p>&quot;Thanks for driving up the loot cutie. I owe ya!&quot; She blew him a
kiss and snapped down the visor. Crouching down for a moment, she leapt 50 feet
into the air and then her thrusters kicked in sending her flying upward and
away.
<p>|NALL!!! You got to stop her!! She just robbed the place!!!! All our winnings
is in those bags!!!|
<p>No need to tell me twice!
<p>Nall crouched down and leapt up into the air, but instead of thrusters, he
spread his expansive wings and took after her.
<p>&quot;Come back here you...you!! Blue Platinum stealer you!!!!&quot;
<p>Flying under her, he swiped at her breastplate which she easily dodged. He
swiped at her several times, missing again and again. seeing that she had no way
of escaping without fighting him, she let go of the bags, and with a sudden
quickness grasped Nall and head butted him. As stars circled around him, she cut
her thrusters and began to fall back down toward the arena him tight in her
grasp.
<p>{Oh no!! Looks she has him set up for her signature move!! The Waterfall!!!}
<p>Her thrusters kicked in as the plummeted head first, the arena grew larger
and larger, and then she kicked of him letting him continue on his own.
<p>{OH!!!! 1.....2.....3...AH...4..Geez!!...5...6!!! Man she just drove him down
through 6 floors of the Arena. And that's reinforced Velium!! Some one get a
cleric for this kid!}
<p>Aquamarine continued back up into the sky, diverting just enough to catch the
falling bags filled to the brim with platinum coins. A second pair of thrusters
angled out and she rocketed up into the night sky.
<p>...women............................ow.....
<p>6 floors down under the arena, Nall's world went black.
<p>|NALL!!!!! Answer me!!!!!!! NALL!|
<p>The winged silver cat Reyas sifted through the mess of velium and mythril
searching desperately for his grandson. After a few minutes, he came upon a
patch of white fur.
<p>|Nall!!!!!|
<p>Reaching in he pulled out a small white winged kitten with a red diamond on
its forehead. Shaking the kitten for a few moment, it mewed grumpily.
<p>Think it's to late to try the Antonican lottery? ow......
<p>The kitten Nall, dozed off to sleep again.<br>
-------------------------------------
<p>Not too far away. On the top of one of mountain peaks in the Oasis of Marr. A
figure wearing a two horned mask of crystal, watched what happened above. As the
events unfolded and concluded. The figure began to talk to itself. at first it
was a man's voice.
<p>&quot;Things are starting once again. The void is growing restless and
stretching out more and more. The teachings have gotten it excited, it must not
be allowed o be free...I should have listened to you.&quot;
<p>The voice continued talking to itself but this time it was a woman's voice.
<p>*You hold to much guilt. Why do you always take so much upon your
shoulders?&quot;*
<p>Then back to the man's
<p>&quot;Because it is my fate not to rest until things are right. I owe her
that much.&quot;
<p>*But why do you place such a have penance upon yourself. You could have
brought her back long ago. It was well within your grasp.*
<p>&quot;With the knowledge of what I have done to this world..and the pain I
put on her I could not bear to look upon her. I would only see pain..nothing but
endless pain.&quot;
<p>*You are so melodramatic...but that is one thing I have always loved about
you. It was why I picked you, because you don't find the easy way out..but even
so. You don't have to take it this far. You can have some happiness.*
<p>&quot;Maybe...but not today. Only when the Void has been silenced.&quot;
<p>*Yes.*
<p>The two voices began to speak together, almost as one, but overlapping each
other.
<p>&quot;The influence of the Void must wiped from Norrath and from al things.
It must not be freed. It is our task, our duty to ensure that the Universe knows
not the touch of the void. And it shall forever be our task, we are one in this,
we are........ Rashan.&quot;<br>
