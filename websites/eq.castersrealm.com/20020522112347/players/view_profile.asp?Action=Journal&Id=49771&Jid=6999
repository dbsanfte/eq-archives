Roleplaying and PvP in EverQuest<BR>
============================<BR><BR>

I have come across a lot of opinions (often rather arrogantly expressed as facts when they are not, but that is another issue) to the effect that for real roleplaying, one has to play in a PvP environment, and that in a normal (PvE) environment, roleplaying is either impossible or even not desirable. This article presents a different perspective on this issue, and it's conclusion, based on nearly two decades of pen-and-paper roleplaying and a passion for roleplaying on a PvE server in EverQuest, is entirely the opposite one.<BR><BR>

I postulate: in practice, a PvP environment in EverQuest actually interferes with roleplaying, and that those who are serious about roleplaying can practice it best in a PvE environment.<BR><BR>

My hope is: if Verant ever do create a RP server, it will be PvE. Whatever the rules after that, I would move to it and play there happily; if it were made to be a PvP server, I'd sigh at the missed opportunity, and remain where I am, roleplaying on the PvE server I am currently on, and hope that a PvE RP server would be created in the future.<BR><BR>

My Background in EverQuest<BR>
=====================<BR><BR>

I roleplay a level 60 high elven cleric on Lanys T'Vyl. I play an assertive roleplay style, in that my character considers all 'evils' as beings to be avoided. By assertive here, I mean, that I have chosen a personality for my cleric that means she will not bow to anothers' will, ever, if it compromises her principles, with no exceptions, and regardless of the consequences or the opposition of others. She has her own rules as to who she considers evil (this could be the subject of another article, so is not discussed here), and these she will never group with, assist, ressurrect, or take assistence from. This has severe downsides (from the view of a non-roleplayer), in that she will not join many groups, will refuse to go on some raids, and will never accept (and has never accepted) the summon corpse spell. It has also lead to being the subject of personal abuse from the 'arrogant powergamer' types who expect a cleric to do as they are told, not only ressurect those of good alignment and leave those who are evil lieing as corpses on the ground. It also leads to attacks from those others who like to think of a 'good' cleric as the convenient 'we forgive all, help all' type; yes, this is one valid way to roleplay a good cleric but the way I have chosen is equally valid (if less popular), and is a far greater challenge to play successfully. But this is how I have done it, and I have stuck to my character as rigidly as I could, with few failures, to my own disadvantage on many occasions, and this challenge and getting to High Priestess rank despite all, has given me a great sense of enjoyment.<BR><BR>

In all this time, I have never so much as duelled anyone for roleplay reasons. I have found no need to. As an avid roleplayer, I have proven more than capable of winning my battles with word and deed and example without need for the lowest common denominator, i.e., direct physical conflict. To anyone who doubts that one can roleplay on a PvE server in EverQuest, I am simple proof that this is not true. The key point here is - I have had fun.<BR><BR>

The Non-Roleplayer Problem<BR>
====================<BR><BR>

So, if I have had fun, why do I want a RP server? Well ... that's easy to answer.<BR><BR>

Although I have, as I have said, had fun, there have been many difficult and awkward situations, due to interactions with non-roleplayers who do not want to understand that others want to play a different way and, effectively, be left alone to do so with people of like mind. Lanys T'Vyl is a wonderful server, but like any server has a whole community of different people with different personality types and maturity levels and attitudes. The vast majority do not roleplay ever, and even of those that do, very few do regularly, and amongst these, all take the 'easy' non-assertive route of bowing to public pressure in times of difficulty. I am to my knowledge unique on Lanys in that I, for example, as a 'good-aligned' cleric, never ressurect a necromancer or accept summon corpse from one, regardless of how difficult this makes things for myself or for those around me, and still managing to reach level 60 and do most of the things the game has to throw at me. The main reason why I am unique is not, I believe, that others do not want to try but, because the pressure of the 'powergamer' types is too great, and the abuse from the few is too much to take for most.<BR><BR>

Now, if I could play my cleric this way on a roleplay server, where goods and evils could not even group, or indeed play any character with both strengths and weaknesses, and where the population of players was highly concentrated in fellow roleplayers who would accept roleplaying reasons for actions, this would be so much more fun. In this environment, my hope would be, the non-roleplayer would be the odd one out, and the powergamer would struggle (I hope). There are ways to make this even better, like guilds also having to be roleplay based, and if multi-group raids also could be somehow made alignment based (not sure how Verant would do this, it's just a thought), this would be a perfect start.<BR><BR>

Issues of who can speak what languages and which channels could or could not be used are minor details, compared to the basic server rules actively supporting keeping to alignment/personality of characters and biasing against those who do not want to roleplay in a consistent way.<BR><BR>

PvP - How popular is it anyway?<BR>
=======================<BR><BR>

Let's look at the EverQuest servers. There are three PvP servers, there are something like, twenty or more PvE servers (no, I have not counted them, this is an approximate figure). Look at the populations. It is easy to see that PvE is far far more popular than PvP. Players vote with their feet here.<BR><BR>

This does not detract from the vociferous minority who love their PvP servers. They comprise some of the most prolific posters on the EverQuest boards, indeed, disproportionally so, and I stress I have nothing against players choosing PvP for themselves, some love it and that's all it needs, each to their own.<BR><BR>

The fact remains, PvP is a minority interest in EverQuest. Verant will have the figures, but I will estimate that at most, the number playing PvP is at most 20% of those online, and most of the time it would be more like 5% to 10%.<BR><BR>

These are facts. Not opinions. The opinions come next.<BR><BR>

So why is PvP so much less popular?<BR>
==========================<BR><BR>

If you ask different people this, you will get many different answers. But the crux of it comes down to this. The PvP environment by its very nature allows player X to interfere with player Y, for whatever reason player X chooses, regardless of player Y's wishes on the matter. Many people so much do not want to be the 'player Y' in this scenario, that they avoid PvP. This is their choice.<BR><BR>

I play a low level paladin on Tallon Zek, the team server. I had to try it, to find out what it was like. It does *feel* different. I can see it appeals greatly to those who play there regularly. But it was not for me. I found when some random de-levelled gnome who conned red to me had killed my high elf paladin enough times for no reason, and had laughed at me when he did it each time, that this was not my idea of 'fun'. He said it was roleplaying. Well, it wasn't and isn't. It was random PK-ing, and he was doing it for no other reason than that he could. Yes, *he* was having fun, but few if any of his random victims were. This is my experience of PvP. It is the experience of many I have spoken to on my PvE server.<BR><BR>

Yes, some people get through this, through drive or a wish to compete or through the sheer thrill or kick they get from the 'increased danger' factor. But the majority of us do not. I am left with the feeling, the PvP servers are for a certain type of person, not for the most of us who want to game our own way with our own friends and interact with others as we want to without undue purposeless harrassment, often in the name of roleplaying. Indeed, I believe, these people dirty the name of 'roleplaying' by describing what they are doing this way.<BR><BR>

My example of the random Pk-ing gnome is a particularly bad example. But the PvP environment panders to those Quake players who love the thrill of the fight with other players. At least in the PvE environment, when I come across an arrogant know-it-all intolerant powergamer type who hates roleplayers and roleplaying, I can simply ignore him and carry on playing the way I love, unmolested. In PvP, this is not possible, when they can ruin my enjoyment and attack me or my friends, not for RP reasons, but because they think it's funny (for them, not us).<BR><BR>

How do Roleplaying and PvP stack up?<BR>
===========================<BR><BR>

I have heard from many non-roleplayers, if you want to roleplay, move to a PvP server. This is a statement made, sadly, in ignorance of what makes a roleplayer. A roleplayer is not interested in purposeless conflict. That is the Quake player or the grief player (who is attracted to PvP). A true roleplayer wants an environment where they can roleplay a rich and deep character, with many facets to their personality, and physical conflict is only a tiny part to this. In a PvP environment, as soon as one player wishes to make a fight, there is one, there is no scope for the other party to roleplay. It all comes back to that common denominator again. In short, true roleplaying demands a PvE environment where there is a /duel capacity, where both parties can roleplay up to a fight or not as they see fit, in line with their character ideals.<BR><BR>

Even with no active grief players (impossible I'd suggest, but taking this aside), I would still not want a PvP environment, as other players are still capable of forcing their brand of roleplaying upon others by physical force with no opt out for the target. This is pretty much why I dislike PvP so much, the inability to avoid direct player-player conflict unless both parties choose it. PvP does NOT help roleplaying here, it harms it, as it removes the freedom to play one's own story without becoming the unwilling 'victim' in someone elses story.<BR><BR>

I have read elsewhere, claims that roleplay without PvP is meaningless. I put forward, that roleplay in EverQuest with PvP is ruined totally by the 'random PK-ing element' and by those who would use their roleplay to harm yours, and that furthermore the true roleplayer does not need PvP at all, but can create his/her story for the character far more easily in a PvE enviroment, and it is both a joy and a challenge to do so. All we need is more people of the same mind to enhance it for all.<BR><BR>

Conclusion<BR>
========<BR><BR>

If a PvP Roleplay server were created tomorrow, I would remain on my blue server. Many would try it but most would not stay, when the random PK-ing and the general pointless killing and non-roleplay became apparent. It would end up as a 4th PvP server, appealing to PvP type players, and the rest of us would remain disappointed.<BR><BR>

If a PvE Roleplay server were created tomorrow, I would start a character there and I am sure I would *love* it. I predict a flood of people moving to the server, and indeed, that it would be a major success (and great fun for all!). Those who did not join in with the roleplay would be unmolested but would be biased against by the ruleset and the community at large (one hopes), and crucially they would not be able to interfere with the roleplaying majority in any way.<BR><BR>

I hope Verant see this future as clearly as I do. I know many love PvP, but far more do not, and I am very much one of the latter.<BR><BR>

I would love to see the PvE Roleplay server as a reality.<BR><BR>
