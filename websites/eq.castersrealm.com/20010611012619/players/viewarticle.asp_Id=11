	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td width='100%'><font face='verdana' size='2pt'><p>Once, long ago, before any knew of the other planes of existence and when dragons were known to be legend and only that, there walked a mighty group of heroes known as the Inquisitors.</p>
 
<p>Foremost among them in strength strode the warrior-woman Saka Orcbane, Heroine of Halas, and artisan of axe and sword... The crafty ranger, Alek Strongoak, possessed a direction sense infallible and was known to shoot a werewolf's eye from half a league away... Zargaza, Lord Mylith, Master of the Arcane Arts, carried terrifying power in his fingertips and called the lighting of the gods to do his bidding... The priest of nature, Almir Amithranduil, strode beside them, in harmony with the heart of Norrath, his soul one with the Mother... Taim Stoutheart, follower of Brell who leaned upon the strength and patience of the great Duke to aid his friends with a throaty chuckle or a saving prayer... Qanadan Huitzilop, holy servant of Tunare, his sharp tongue cloaked by a gentle touch that could heal the most grievous of ills...</p>

<p> These were the men and women of yore who boldly stepped through the gates of the Estate of Unrest that cold winter night. And here our story begins... </p>            

<p>These heroes journeyed through the Cauldron to the crumbling mansion to clear the evil that lurked within...They had also heard rumors of the magical treasure that lay in the clutches of the foul beasts that hung just past the reaches of life and had not yet entered the peace of death. To gain for themselves the treasure and the glory of purging the realm of abomination, the heroes set forth.</p>

<p>Upon entering the house, Lord Mylith asked Saka to draw out the creatures into the open. Saka, being uncertain and new to the area, so far from her beloved homeland, seemed reticent.</p>

<p>"How will I know the way, Zargaza?" she hedged. "You know I have the courage, but even I may be overcome alone."</p>

<p>The Lord Mylith smiled thinly in his pale high elven face. "Have no fear, dear Lady," he cooed, as he knew the very mention of fear would rile her. "I do know the way and I shall guide you from behind your eyes." Power sizzled from his fingertips, and reaching up, he seized either side of her head at her temples.</p>

<p>Saka gasped as she felt magic seep through her skull and into her brain. The power settled sickeningly, just out of reach, and Saka took a wary step forward as the Lord Mylith took a deep breath and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>At first, Saka thought that nothing had changed-- that the spell, whatever it was, had failed. And she nearly jumped out of her skin when her eyes moved, scanning the room of their own accord, without her consent.</p>

<p>"There now," Lord Mylith whispered. "Go to the stairs..."</p>

<p>Mechanically, the mighty Saka followed his instruction, willing her mind to relax and follow without question the instructions of the man she knew to be her friend and brother.</p>

<p>She stalked through the house, incongruously silent for her size...As she slipped from room to room, she felt the now-comforting touch of the Lord Mylith's mind in hers, holding her hand as she went. Finally, she found what Zargaza accepted as a likely target.</p>

<p>She stepped into the creature's range and feinted at it, then spun and raced back into the hallways of the house, glorying in the danger of rushing in near-safety through the strange place, guided by other than her own memory.</p>

<p>As she rounded a corner at full speed, she felt a sort of lightening...a fading... a brief mental curse from the mind of her brother... And suddenly she was alone.</p>

<p>A cold sweat of panic at the desertion broke over Saka's forehead, and she missed a step as she ran. Knowing that to stop was to risk mutilation, death or worse, she charged ahead again blindly, bolting into the blackness with the desperation reserved for the wounded polar bear who has no way of escape.</p>

<p>As she ricocheted off bannisters and door frames, Saka saw a light ahead and made for it. She bounded into a room lit by a single candle...that housed three oozing ghoul-like beasts. Boots scrabbling on the floor she spun and raced back out the door. But not before the ghouls saw her, and wheezing, slithered after her.</p>

<p>Down the hallway she rushed, boots thudding as hard as her heart, back aching from the claws that had gouged her flesh when she faltered enough to be reached.</p>

<p>She neared an alcove but did not pass it alone...from its recesses a shambling bony nightmare cackled, appeared and joined the chase.</p>

<p>As she began to slow, muscles cramping, she turned yet another corner and nearly lost her will...a long straight hallway stretched before her and disappeared into the darkness...Was there no end?</p>

<p>Her barbarian's heart would not let her give in. Though exhausted, winded and wounded, Saka put one heavy foot in front of the other and continued on. A hollow-sounding howl almost did not catch her attention, but the raking claws of the werebat the howl belonged to certainly did.</p>

<p>Letting out her own howl of agony as the claws tore her side, Saka found a burst of adrenaline within her and made a final run for her life. At the end of the hallway, she finally saw another light and heard voices...the uncertain, concerned queries of a wood elven druid, the frankly worried tones of a wizard and the biting remarks of a sarcastic priest terrified her though they were her friends...She knew what she was dragging on top of them behind her.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath that hurt her lungs, Saka bellowed, "RUN!" at them as she reached the door they stood behind.</p>

<p>They did no such thing.</p>

<p>Almir, hearing her coming, yanked the door open and stood clear. Saka barreled through the doorway and hurdled the bannister as she fled the house. Calling upon the magic of the ages, Zargaza drew fire and ice into his body from the heavens and discharged it violently into the back of the werebat. The creature turned on him as Alek tackled a carrion ghoul and the two priests had their holy hands full keeping the combatants alive.</p>

<p>Saka, grievously wounded, staggered through the courtyard, toward the gate and into the tunnel that would lead to the Cauldron. She could hear her friends' grunts and muffled shouts behind her, but was miserably powerless to save them; she had given all she had in the run for her life.</p>

<p>"I've killed us all," she sobbed as she crawled unthinkingly for the safety of the tunnel. "I should have died in the house...I should have..."</p>

<p><b>"STOP!"</b></p>

<p>A clarion shout rang through the tunnel, magnified a thousandfold by the solid rock surrounding her. Saka was frozen in shock and looked up to see, standing like an avenging angel, her beloved friend Wendyll, a priestess of Tunare from nearby Felwithe. Wendyll smiled in a mix of comforting warmth and righteous cold as she bent to touch the dying warrior and murmur a blessing of Tunare.</p>

<p>Saka felt strength flow back into her body...her heart, almost stilled forever, pounded with a renewed vigor, and she stood, looking beyond the radiant Wendyll to see rallied behind her all her Inquisitor brothers and sisters who had heard the plight of their falling family and raced to their aid.</p>

<p>Saka grasped Wendyll's slender forearm in her calloused paw in heartfelt thanks. Then she turned, leading the charge back into the fray with a shriek of triumphal vengeance and the strength of blood and treasured love at her back.</p>

<p>************************************************</p>

<p>The undead fell that day, and the original monster that Saka drew from its hiding place yielded up a thick leather apron which she gladly strapped round her waist, a trophy and symbol of endurance and trust.</p>
