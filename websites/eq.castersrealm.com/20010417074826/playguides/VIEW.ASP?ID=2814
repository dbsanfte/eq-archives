This is a guide of how I played my Halfling Rogue through these levels so you
may not always agree with everything I say. Levels 1-5 Misty Thicket, Greater
Faydark. Create a Halfling Rogue and I suggest putting creation points as many
as you can into strength and the remaining 5 to either agility or dexterity. As
you start off in the boisterous city Rivervale, you should find the Rogue
Guildmaster Lendel Deepockets who is located in the Fool's Gold building on the
topmost floor. Give him the note you start off and receive your 2ac tunic. Train
one point into piercing and you're done. Head out of Fool's Gold into the zone
which is directly in front of it. You are now in the Misty Thicket. Equip your
Dagger into your weapon slot and prepare to battle. You should start off by
killing mostly bats and large rats, and any other MOBs that con even to you. And
if you ever get into any trouble you can run to the Halfling Deputies and let
them kill whatever is chasing you.&nbsp;<br>
You start with the Hide skill which makes you invisible to mostly both normal
and undead mobs, but there are some exceptions. You know that you have
successfully hidden by the message &quot;You are hidden.&quot; This skill allows
you to only remain hiding while standing still. Halflings also begin with the
Sneak skill which allows you to sneak up behind monsters without them attacking
you, until you attack them though. When this skill is used in conjunction with
hide, it will allow you to sneak around while hidden, but at a very slow pace.
Rogues who have attained level 50+ can hide/sneak at a running pace! At level 2
you can now start killing the fire beetles and spiderlings that con even to you.
Be careful with the beetles and spiderlings, as they will team up on you if
another fellow MOB is nearby. Level 3 hunt the same MOBs and also the occasional
goblin worker and bixie, and also remember to train in your hide skill at the
guildmaster.&nbsp;<br>
At Level 4, I still suggest hunting the same stuff. Train in the Dodge skill at
the Rogue Guildmaster which is a very useful defensive skill later on. Buy a
backpack as soon as you can which will make you more efficient in getting some
cash.&nbsp;<br>
Now you are level 5 and you have a choice,&nbsp; you can either start hunting in
the second area of the Misty Thicket which is on the other side of the long
wall, or you can try to find a friendly druid or wizard who is about level 29+
to Teleport you to either Butcherblock or the Greater Faydark. I myself went to
the Greater Faydark. Once you get a teleport you should first ask for someone to
escort you to Kelethin, the treetoptown of the Wood Elves. Shout out and get a
bind in Kelethin. Now since you are level 5 you can start hunting at the orc
hill which is packed with Centurions, Shamans, Oracles, and Pawns.&nbsp;<br>
Levels 6-11 Greater Faydark, Crushbone, East Commons. Get a group on the hill
and kill Orcs until you get to level 6. Goto the Kelethin Rogue Guild Building
and train in the picklock skill which allows you to lockpick locked doors within
a certain skill level. Now you can go ahead and hunt in Crushbone which is a
separate zone located not far away from the orc camps. In here you will find a
variety of Orcs ranging from levels 2-20ish. Frequent trains often give this
place a bad name, but hunting the Orc centurions here will give you great EXP
plus Crushbone belts. I suggest going to the left of the entrance of CB and hunt
orcs there by the bridge. Kill all orcs that con green, blue, and even if you
can. Keep hunting these orcs until about level 7. Now you can train in a new
skill for Rogues called Pickpocket, which allows you to steal non-magical items,
and coin from MOBs around your level. This skill will raise fairly quickly if
you use it often and it gets fun at higher skill levels. Now you should have
collected a fairly large amount of CB belts. Head to Kaladim the Dwarf City and
turn them into some Dwarf in the Warrior's Guild there. You should get about 1/4
of a bubble or less from each cb belt and with around 25 it can take you to
level 8. You also get some patchwork and tattered stuff to wear for yourself,
and some coin. In Kaladim you can find the Rogue Guild which is a mine in the
North Kaladim zone. You can now train in Sense Traps skill at the Guild master,
and this skill allows you to sense any nearby traps supposedly. I have yet to
actually use this skill. You can now either stay in Crushbone and hunt the
Slavers, or take the boat to Freeport which is the next city you should go to. I
chose to go to Freeport because I like to travel a lot.&nbsp;<br>
First get a bind in West Freeport at the gate. Now you head out of the city and
zone into East Commons. Shout out and get a group into either orc camp 1 or orc
camp 2. Hunting here gives amazing exp at these levels, provided you have
established a good group. One thing is for sure when hunting here, and it is you
definitely cannot tank or take hits because you will get beat to death quick by
the orcs here. So leave it up to the main tanks of the group to take the
beating. You will be level 9 in a jiffy, and you are very close to getting
backstab. Keep poking those orcs until you get level 10 where you will go to
East Freeport, go under the docks and find the Rogue Guild there which is hidden
behind an illusionary wall, and train at least 5 points into Backstab. In order
for this skill to work you need to have a piercing weapon in your primary melee
slot. This will do some nice damage provided you have a weapon base damage at
least over 5. You will need to get behind the MOB that you are attacking and
then use Backstab. The Backstab button will pop back up for use again in about 8
seconds. This skill is also an advantage when fighting up close in front because
since you are not in front of the monster you will get an extra hit instead of a
backstab. Orcs 1 or 2 will be your main camps until you reach level 12.&nbsp;<br>
Levels 12-14 North Ro, Oasis. Since you are level 12 you would like to train in
Safe Fall skill. Safe Fall works automatically so there is no need to press a
button or anything. This skill decreases the damage taken on falls. The higher
skill the less damage taken or no damage at all on small falls. Sadly, this
skill maxes at around the 99ish skill level. You can practice this skill by
running/walking down steep cliffs and hills. You do not have to take damage to
raise the skill, but it has to be a high enough drop to allow you to gain skill
from it. Also at level 12 you get the Parry skill which allows you to block an
opponents attack with your own weapon. This skill will raise automatically once
you train in it, so I suggest putting only 1 point into it. I have found that
the best zones to hunt during these levels is either Nro or the overpopulated
Oasis. I suggest heading directly over to Nro to hunt some Dervish Cutthroats.
Get into Derv camp 2 if you can because this has the most spawn points, 5, so it
gives the best exp. Derv 3 is near the zone wall and has 3 spawn points which
makes it the safest to hunt. And Derv 1 is somewhere along the beach and has I
think 4 spawn points, but with a very nasty 25ish Dark Elf NPC named Dorn. He
will be kos to you and will kill you in an instant so be very careful in Derv 1
to not get close to him. There are mainly 4 types of Dervs that come in the
camps. There are the Warrior/Rogue types that are the easiest and they come in
the Human, Barbarian, and Orc races. These types have been known to backstab for
70 points of damage so keep an eye out behind you. There is a Shaman type which
spawns as a female Ogre, who has very little hps and will cast a small DoT spell
on you. The Wizard type is one of the most devastating. They come as Erudites
and will cast, cast, and cast on you until you are dead, they also have damage
shields on. These have low hps like the ogre caster and must be killed first.
And there is the Warrior type which is a Male Ogre and he hits very hard for
your level so be wary. The loot here is decent with some gold, occasional bronze
weapon which sell for pp, and some derv rings which give +2 dex and 1 ac which
you should use if you don't have better ones by now. You can either hunt here
during levels 12-14 or go to Oasis which is adjacent to Nro. This place is
filled the people, Crocodiles, Caiman, Sand Giants, and an occasional loose
Spectre. You can hunt blue caimans here which are found along the beach and are
about 13ish. You can hunt these solo, but make sure your bind wound skill is
high because you will be bandaging a lot! I think a group of about 2 or 3 is
best for here to kill caimans and also crocodiles if you can. These animals will
not team up on you so you will always have only one to handle. This place gives
the best exp but there just isn't any loot here except gator meat! From hunting
in these zones, upon reaching the 13th level you should go ahead and train in
Duel Wield. This skill allows you to equip a weapon in your offhand weapon slot.
You will sometimes attack with the secondary weapon with you skill maxed at
these levels. I suggest always keeping the weapon with the highest damage on
your primary attack slot to do higher average points of backstab.
<p>&nbsp;-Armor-&nbsp;<br>
During the levels 1-14 I think that you should stick to banded armor. It's not
the best ac, weight, or look but this armor comes very affordable and you should
be buying this unless a better opportunity for armor comes. I don't suggest
Blackened Iron Armor. It's heavy, doesn't give better ac, and only looks really
cool. It also costs a lot more. And as a Rogue you should try to buy any armor
that give AC, Strength, Dexterity, Agility, and Stamina. AC affects how much
damage you take from each hit, so the more AC the better. Strength affects your
backstab damage average mainly. Dexterity determines weapon skill increase rate
and how often you proc with a weapon that has an effect. Agility gives extra ac.
Stamina gives hit points and gives you more stamina during those very long
fights</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Weapons-&nbsp;<br>
Your main weapon type will of course be Piercing. You can raise 1hs if needed
be. At these levels try to get a magical weapon as fast as you can to hit those
invulnerable MOBs that can only be hit with magic/magic weapons. Try to get a
Dragoon Dirk or a Dagger of Dropping since these are relatively within your
reach right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Miscellaneous-&nbsp;<br>
You should buy rings and earrings that give strength. there are Golden Amber
Earrings which give +3Str but no ac, Silver Amber Rings that give +2Str, and
Jagged Bands which are expensive at this level that give +3Str , 5ac. Always try
to go for jewelry that gives Strength and/or Dexterity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Your Role In Battle-&nbsp;<br>
I don't suggest soloing because it is very nearly impossible except at low
levels and that it gets very boring. Your role in a group is to deal the damage.
Backstab as often as you can and find the backs of those MOBs. Try not to take
hits, but it will be hard because your backstab is such a major taunt, even
sometimes when you miss! Have as much fun as you can and I hope this guide will
help you in your journeys through EverQuest..</p>
