<p>---------------------------------<br>
Best of the Best Round 2 </p>

<p>---------------------------------<br>
And so the Freeport Best of the Best Tournament continued. </p>

<p>&quot;FIGHTERS ENTER FOR THE TEST OF MIGHT!&quot; </p>

<p>* The entrants in the test of might enter the Freeport Arena
in singles. Each one showing to the crowd their skills and
proficiency. A warrior from Halas, who just barely made it to the
second round, because his opponent in the first round was another
warrior, had an interesting, if not comical demonstration. </p>

<p>2 workers bring out large stacks of sun baked bricks. They
piled the bricks into a stack of 15. Shouting into the audience,
he got them into a big stir. And then with a powerful chop he
straight through the bricks or at least that was his intention.
He go as far as the 4th brick...from the top and then ran
screaming and hollering for a cleric as he had broken every bone
in his hand. </p>

<p>The next two were truly impressive. The next entrant was one
of the Kaladim Mining Guild 628, the royal scouts/rogues/thieves,
whatever you would wish to call them. He picked a lady from out
of the arena crowd and placed her against the arena wall. Then he
had some of Freeport's guards bring out a table, on which was an
assortment of throwing knives. He then had them guard the knives.
With a shout to the crowd to get them in an uproar, he amazing
slipped by the guards got the knives, and threw them expertly
around the lady making a perfect outline. The Crowd roared with
approval for him. I must admit I did too, it was impressive. </p>

<p>The next one was another of the Ashen Order. Reyia Swiftwind,
one of the guilds elite. First she repeated the brick-breaking
demo that the warrior had tried to do. Only this time shattering
23 bricks without a flinch, then she showed off some of the
guild's most famous techniques. Most notably the Ianuki, ground
shatter technique and Ar's favorite by the way, the Flying Dragon
Fist, a technique that cause the monk to unleash a powerful
flying uppercut, which in her case sent her a breathtaking 25
feet into the air. </p>

<p>Then it was my turn. I entered the arena and moved to the
center. I was still thinking of what I was going to do. </p>

<p>/So great Master Raziel, what are you going to do to show your
might?/ </p>

<p>I haven't a clue. </p>

<p>/You better hurry and think of something. The crowd is getting
rowdy/ </p>

<p>&quot;DO SOMETHING! QUIT STANDING THERE!&quot; </p>

<p>I know. </p>

<p>/O no. Not that. That hasn't been used in hundreds of years.
Why do you think the council banned it?/ </p>

<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again to you Reyas since
when have I listened to the Council? </p>

<p>/Cazic spare me.../ </p>

<p>Raziel motions the audience to silence down and move up higher
into the arena seating. He assumes an erect posture. He stands
still for a moment; the crowd gets noisy again. But not for long,
they quite down again as strings of mana begin to flow through
the air and collect around Raziel. It takes a few moments for him
to ready, but the mana strings awe the crowd. </p>

<p>/O lord...here it comes.../ </p>

<p><br>
Suddenly Raziel's stance shifts. </p>

<p>&quot;RAAAAAAAAGGGGGIIING STORRRM!!!&quot; </p>

<p>The ground rattles and the air around Raziel whips around
violently. And a huge shockwave races through the Arena. A few
moments later the dust settles and people can see clearly. The
Arena floor has been whipped around violently and Raziel aside
from being a bit dusty is unharmed. The crowd roars with approval
and a few shout for an encore. * </p>

<p>/Well that was...messy to say the least. Do you realize how
bad that would have been had you done it correctly?/ </p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>/and your ok with that?/ </p>

<p>Aside from causing everyone laundry duty, yep. </p>

<p>/I wonder about you sometimes......./<br>
------------------------------------------ </p>

<p>The tournament continued on to the next round, which included
weapons. This was a brief and occasionally bloody round. </p>

<p>The poor warrior was first; he faced the Dwarf from the 628.
It was quick. Two pokes from a dagger and a swift kick and down
he went. Well, he tried. It could have been worse, he could have
faced Reyia or me...or anyone else. Poor guy. Why do they let
such unskilled people into the Arena? I guess I'll never know. </p>

<p>It continued on and around the middle of the rounds, it was my
turn. I seem to have a certain magnetism to the Ashen Order.
Because I faced Reyia. </p>

<p>&quot;THE THIRD FIGHT IS A ARMED MATCH!&quot; &quot;THE FIRST
FIGHTER, FROM FREEPORTS OWN, THE ASHEN ORDER. REYIA
SWIFTWIND!&quot; </p>

<p>*<br>
Reyia entered doing flips causing the crowd to roar. She showed
off a few moves getting herself warmed up. She signified her
readiness by using the Flying Dragon Fist again. Breaking her
previous record by a foot. </p>

<p>* </p>

<p>*<br>
&quot;HER OPPONENT ALL THE WAY FROM ODUS. THE AMAZING RAZIEL
EOM'BRN!&quot; </p>

<p>I entered the arena. Circled the Arena for show. Shouted out
to the crowd, got them riled up. </p>

<p>/Aren't you the showmen?/ </p>

<p>This is fun. </p>

<p>* </p>

<p>*<br>
Then Reyia and I faced off. I drew my sword and readied myself
for the gong. The gong sang out and I was about to attack when
Reyia did something I wasn't expecting. She backed up, twirled
her Bo and slammed it into the ground letting it stand straight
up. I followed suit and placed my blade in the ground. And
assumed a defensive stance. We circled each other for 2
rotations. Then she sprang at me using a flying tiger strike. I
dodged out of the way. She then used a blitzkrieg of punches and
kicks. Which I tried to block but she was really fast and she
slipped through and clipped me on the shoulders and stomach. I
reeled giving her an inch, and then she took advantage and took a
mile. She opened with the symbol of the Ashen Order the flying
Kick and slammed me into the wall. She then restarted the assault
of punches and kicks which drove me further into<br>
the wall. I wonder how thick are the Arena walls? Well I almost
found out, but she stopped just short of sending me through, by
deviating to her signature move, the Flying Dragon Fist. This
sent us both into the air. </p>

<p>In midair, she switched techniques to continue assaulting me
in midair, but this time I caught her fist. And then planted the
back of my hand across her head a few times. About this time, our
upward momentum faded and we began to go back down. All the way
down we traded blows, neither of us gaining an advantage over the
other. Then we crashed to the arena floor. The wind pretty much
knocked out of both of us. </p>

<p>&quot;5!......6!...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Get up Reyia! Get up!&quot; shouted someone from the
crowd. </p>

<p>&quot;Come on Raziel!&quot; someone, shouted for me. </p>

<p>&quot;8!......9!....&quot; Then they cheered, we were both up.
</p>

<p>We locked each other again. We assumed our stances again. I
attacked this time. I planted one fist in her sternum, causing
her too lose her air again. Then I used a round kick to the side
of her head, which sent her flying, she handsprings and then
backflipped to her staff, picking it up in mid flip. She whirled
it around, and resumed her assault. I dodged her swings and then
catapulted myself over her, grabbing my sword in the air like she
did and faced her. </p>

<p>The crowd was pretty quiet at the moment. They were awestruck,
this had been the longest and so far one of the most entertaining
matches yet. </p>

<p>We charged again her Bo rattling off my sword again and again.
But her Bo was made of wood and if you pit wood against metal,
guess who will win. Her Bo shattered, startling her. I did like
she did earlier and took a mile. I planted a swift kick to her
stomach, then my fist to her chin. Then in a bit of extravagance,
I jumped into the air grasping her head with my feet, and rolled
forward. Catapulting her into the arena wall. I then charged
forward and used a flying kick, and I found out how thick the
walls are. Not very. She cracked through it and crashed to the
other side. </p>

<p>&quot;9!!....10!!! THE WINNER!!! RAZIEL EOM'BRN!&quot; </p>

<p>I raised my fist into the air. &quot;ALL RIGHT!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;RAZIEL!!&quot; Arorua cheered loudly again.<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
Well that was my last fight of the day. So I retired to my room
at the inn. Which, was the first in a series of bad events. </p>

<p>&quot;Mister Raziel?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes? Come in?&quot; </p>

<p>It was the son of the Inn owner. </p>

<p>&quot;I saw your fight against Reyia. WOW. It as soo cool. I
never thought anyone could beat her!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Umm......gee....Mom said I was supposed to tell you
sumpthin......o YEAH! Your fight will be starting soon you need
to get to the arena.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Alright.&quot; </p>

<p>The kid shuffled to the door. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey. Take this.&quot; I handed him the Sash that Reyia
had given me for besting her. </p>

<p>&quot;WOW Thanks Mister!&quot; </p>

<p>He adorned himself with the sash and mimicked a few of Reyia's
moves. Then left. I headed out side also. Wondering where Arorua
was.<br>
----------------------------------<br>
I entered the holding area underneath the Arena. I sat down and
waited for a while and waited my turn. </p>

<p>Then a voice came from behind me. </p>

<p>&quot;You are like a pebble in my shoe, you are always causing
me pain and anguish.&quot; </p>

<p>That voice. It couldn't be... </p>

<p>/Mathasar/ </p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing here.&quot; I turned to him; he had a
new form. A barbarian male. The warrior who lost earlier. Damn
it! Why hadn't I been able to see through his illusion like
before? </p>

<p>&quot;You should know by know. The work of our lord
Inorrouk.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The last time you tried you failed. Quite miserably in
fact.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It is of no import. The Dread King was doomed to fail,
unlike the others I could have cared less if he succeeded or not.
I got what I wanted.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don't suppose you will tell me?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Of course, I will. My freedom.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah. So your are nothing but a strumpet for the Dark
elves?&quot; </p>

<p>He growled at me. </p>

<p>&quot;You should watch your tongue. It might cost you
dearly.&quot; </p>

<p>He smiled. It was my turn to lose my temper.
&quot;Mathasar....&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If you want the wench back come to the Shrine in the
West Commons.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;MATHASAR!&quot; </p>

<p>He cackled at me. That broke the last straw. I charged him; he
caught me and threw me against the wall. He slashed me across the
chest and picked me above his head and threw me through the wall
out into the arena. He stepped out and began to shift to his
other form. He swelled to 9 feet and grew wings and talons. He
was one of the Dark elves Experiments, he was<br>
massive. The crowd in the arena panicked and began to scream and
holler as they tried to leave the Arena. The Guards tried to
swarm in to help. </p>

<p>&quot;So much for the great savior of Faydwer. AHAHAAHA.
You're nothing in comparison to me. Now that my bonds have been
broken, there is nothing that can stop me.&quot; </p>

<p>He leaned over and picked me up by the head and lifted me up
into the air. &quot;And my first task shall be to enjoy your
mate. I must say you picked well.&quot; He licked his lips.
&quot;I shall enjoy taking her and then slowly carving her into
bits.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You will not harm a hair on her head!&quot; I struck out
planting my foot in his gut. Causing him just enough pain to let
me go. I dropped to the ground and kicked his knees causing him
to crash to the ground. I grabbed him by the shoulders. He
screamed in pain as his blood began to boil and his skin began to
crisp. He swatted me with his large hand<br>
knocking me away. </p>

<p>He flinched slightly. &quot;Gahh. You cause me much pain. But
your wench will feel a thousand fold of what I feel.&quot; He
leapt into the air and headed of into the distance. </p>

<p>The guards swarmed to me. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you all right?&quot; They kept shouting to me, but I
didn't hear them. </p>

<p>&quot;MATHASAR!!!!!&quot; I roared into the air, and then in a
brief explosion of power the guards were knocked away. And a
raven streaked from the Arena into the air.<br>
------------------------------------- </p>

<p>/Raziel/ </p>

<p>Shut up </p>

<p>/Damn it Raziel listen to me!/ </p>

<p>WHAT! </p>

<p>/You don't to hear this, but. If you want to save her..../ </p>

<p>I know! I know! </p>

<p>/Mathasar is an unbonded cacodemon. Their power is far beyond
anything you have faced so far. Granted the Dread King at his
full strength makes them look like chew toys, but you never saw
him at his full strength. / </p>

<p>It doesn't matter now. </p>

<p>/But you do realize what it will mean if you../ </p>

<p>If I want to save her, then I have no choice. </p>

<p>/She probably wont...../ </p>

<p>I know but I rather her hate me and be alive, then love me and
dead.<br>
-------------------------------------------- </p>

<p>Mathasar had assumed a weaker form again, that off a dark elf.
He moved over to Arorua who was lying across the shrine. He bent
over and examined her. She flinched when he touched her. He
laughed &quot;This will only be the beginning wench..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Lay another hand on her Mathasar.....&quot; </p>

<p>He turned round to face Raziel at the edge of the shrine. </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel..&quot; She smiled weakly at him, it was obvious
that Mathasar had drugged her. &quot;ahh so you made it. You
always seem to know how to spoil my fun Raziel. I was just about
to show her a few things that all good wenches should know.&quot;
He smiled evilly. </p>

<p>&quot;Mathasar. You are a fool.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;O am I?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There should be 3 things that even an idiot like you
should know.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And what's that?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;1. Never touch another man's mead. 2. Never touch
another man's food.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And number three?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And above all else. Never..ever....mess with a Hell
Knight's woman!&quot; </p>

<p>A bolt of lightning leapt from the heavens and struck Raziel
with a blinding flash and flames leapt about the ancient shrine.
Arorua and Mathasar blinked trying to see through the daze that
accompanies a flash of light. And they saw a figure in Jet-Black
armor and wielding a blade shimmering with power. </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel...no... cant..be....&quot; Arorua went
unconscious. </p>

<p><br>
&quot;So, the mighty Templar, is wolf in sheep's clothing. Hah!
You and I are quite alike.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I am nothing like you.&quot; Raziel raised his sword
pointing it towards Mathasar &quot;Now this ends..&quot; Raziel
faded away. &quot;Yes it does&quot; Mathasar shifted to his
demonic form and faded away. </p>

<p>High above, in the sky. Mathasar went at each other with an
unnatural ferocity. Parrying slashes and stabs with blinding
speed. Fading in and out of sight across the skyline. But the
aerial battle lasted briefly. With amazing speed Raziel slipped
under Mathasar's guard and cut him straight across the belly.
Mathasar roared in anguish. He roared once again as a downward
slice severed his left arm and his left wing. He lost his control
and plummeted to the ground. The landed back at the temple.
Mathasar smashing into several pillars and ricocheting of the
wall. </p>

<p>&quot;How can this be... I can not be beaten like this..&quot;
</p>

<p>&quot;Your kind can never best one who has walked the flames
of Fear.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I can! And I will!!&quot; He charged again but met
Raziel's blade through his midsection. He coughed up blood and
slid back off it. He stumbled around. Making a last move. He
dashed over to Arorua and picked her up by her head. </p>

<p>&quot;Call back the armor!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why should I listen to the rants of the dead.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I am far from dead! You and this wench are the dead
ones&quot; ** &quot;Now, one last time! Retract the armor..&quot;
His form swelled to a greater size. Lifting Arorua off the altar
and into the air. &quot;or I'll tear her apart! HAHAHAHAHA&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You never learn.&quot; Raziel faded away. Arorua crashed
to the ground. Mathasar moved his last as he fell backwards, his
head ripping off Raziel's sword. He lay there on the ground
still, but he was just barely alive. Raziel knelt beside him and
looked him into the eyes. </p>

<p>&quot;How...How can I lose.....I ..am....&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Concern yourself not with how you lost...but how your
soul will suffer the agony of eternity as my own.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No..Please! No!&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel's eyes went white and he grasped Mathasar by the neck.
Energy crackled and sparked and Mathasar screamed in agony. Then
it was over. All that was left of Mathasar was a smoking husk. </p>

<p>Raziel stood up. Enjoying the sensation of the newfound power
flowing through him. Then the euphoria stopped and he turned to
check on Arorua. He met a small bolt of mana, it bounced
harmlessly away. But it still stopped him. </p>

<p>&quot;GET AWAY FROM ME!!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Arorua...I..&quot; </p>

<p>'Your just as filthy as he is! I trusted you; I gave myself to
you, I..I..' </p>

<p>&quot;Arorua I never meant to....&quot; Another bolt hit him. </p>

<p>&quot;GO AWAY!! If I ever see you again, I'll...I'll... KILL
YOU!!!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry&quot; Raziel faded away, a raven took his
place and flew off into the distance. </p>

<p>Arorua curled up and cried. <br>

Chapter 16 The Future through the Past<br>
--------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Night falls over the continent of Odus, and
high in the air a raven flies across the skyline. It swoops over
the Ivory Bridge and perches on top of it. The raven shimmers
slightly and is replaced by Raziel. He sits on top of the bridge
and looks across the Geneve River that cuts through the
continent. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Damn it. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">/I don't know what to tell you Raziel. There
was always a chance that she would find out./ </font></p>

<p><font size="3">I know, but why like that? Damn him. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">/I don't think there was any good way for her
to find out. What were you going to do, late one night going to
say &quot;o by the way Honey, I forgot to mention I am a Knight
of Hell and I have come to spread the name of Cazic-Thule across
the world. Now that is out of the way, lets go to bed and make a
few kids.&quot;/ </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Sounded like a good plan at the time. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">/.... Well at least you haven't lost your sense
of humor./ </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><br>
Yeah... </font></p>

<p><font size="3">/Well. Now that we are back in Odus, might as
well go report to the council. / </font></p>

<p><font size="3">I am beginning to not like the Council. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">/Have you ever? / </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Good point.<br>
------------------------------ </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The boat to Butcherblock slowly pulls into
port. Several passengers get off. Followed by the crew who are
unloading some freight from Freeport. One of the passengers is
Arorua; she exits the boat and moves onto the docks. She watches
the waves gently lap at the shoreline, listening to the waves
beat. She is remembering all that has happened in the last 8
months. The initial attack by the Crushbone orcs, the rallying of
the continent to defend against them. Her mission to retrieve the
great dwarven smith Gillagad from imprisonment, its failure, the
loss of her friends. Then she remembered Raziel who saved her
life from the 3 orcs. He had saved her from being killed several
times in the time that she knew him. But why? He didn't need her
to complete his espionage into Felwithe. Had he truly felt
feelings for her? No. It was all a lie; a dog of Cazic-Thule knew
nothing of such things. He only did it to cement his position. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">She looked down to her hand; the ring as still
on her finger. In her anger and sadness she had forgotten it. She
reached down and took it off; then hurled out into the ocean. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Or at least that's what she wanted to do. For
some reason she couldn't do it. She took the ring and placed into
a small pouch and then set off for Felwithe.<br>
-------------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The elevator rumbled to life as Raziel turned
the bone key. It made it's slow descent into Paineel. After a few
moments it stopped and the doors to the city appeared in front of
him. The Skeleton guards snapped to attention and saluted him as
he passed by. He walked through the winding halls and into a
small grassy courtyard. He stopped for a moment and watched as
two apprentice necromancers were playing with their first
summoning. The skeletons of some small rodents were fighting each
other. One eventually of the skeletons eventually collapsed and
the victorious apprentice jumped up and down to celebrate her
victory. Raziel smiled, he had missed much. There was a time when
he knew every apprentice, know there were many new faces. He
continued past them and through a portcullis and entered another
grassy courtyard. On the far end was the Shadow Knight guildhall.
He moved right passed it and into a glass mirror. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The scenery around him distorted slightly and
he got that weird tingling sensation, that one gets when passing
through a portal. He appeared in front of another mirror. This
time near the Council chambers. He went to enter when a voice
spoke to him. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Long time, no see big guy&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">He turned. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Meya?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yep&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel noticed something was different about
her. Then he noticed the pendant around her neck and that she
seems a bit swollen. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;So who's the lucky guy?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You never miss anything do you? I got
married to Phaeril, a two months ago&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;He is a very lucky man. He must be very
proud,&quot; He said placing his hand on her stomach. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, he is. I know Melchoir will grow up
to be a son to make him proud&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Ashyur using his senses again?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;No my own. Ashyur has been training me
ever since I got back from Kunark.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel knew what that meant. Ashyur had picked
her to be his replacement in the Council. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You are leading a charmed life. A good
husband and you are going to be seated in the Council soon.&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Actually, I already am in the Council.
Ashyur has been getting weaker and weaker. He rarely comes to the
sessions anymore.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;...&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;But, I don't worry about it. He has lead
a good life, and he is content.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;That's good.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">They stared at each other for a few moments. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I have to go make my report to the
Council, I guess I will see you in a few then.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I guess so.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel turns back to the chamber doors and
begins to head in, when Meya places her hand on his shoulder. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You shouldn't let it concern you too
much. You did what you could, now it is up too fate.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">She removes her hand and leaves. Raziel pauses
for a moment, then continues inside.<br>
----------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;So. He was an imposter like
Mathasar?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, M'lord&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;That is unfortunate. He took much from us
and rallied a great many of our people behind him. But how do you
feel Arorua?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I don't know M'lord&quot; She trembled
slightly. &quot;I feel confused. I feel defiled, dishonored but
I......&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The King rose up from his throne and moved in
front of her. He placed his hands on her shoulders. &quot;You
will be alright, Young Arorua. Tunare will purify you of his
touch. You will be fine Young one.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Thank you, Sir.&quot;<br>
----------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;That is all that happened in your time
away?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes Commandant Seyjuah&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You have done well Raziel. You have
acquired much knowledge for us. &quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Thank you Sir.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The arising of the Dread King was quite
unforeseen. But it seems like he fell rather swiftly for a demon
that nearly destroyed the Alter Planes.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, but it was that which allowed for
his swift defeat. His powers had been drained over the course of
history and his imprisonment by the Combine Empire furthered
that.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I see. And what of the cacodemon that
infiltrated Felwithe?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;His body was destroyed and as for his
soul.....&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Ahh. Well done Raziel, you are
dismissed.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;By your leave.&quot; Raziel turns and
leaves the chambers. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;He is hiding something from us. What do
you sense Meya?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I cannot sense anything from him
Commandant. My skills still pale behind M'Lord Ashyur&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I see. How much longer will Ashyur
fare?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Not much sir. His strength is rapidly
fading. I suspect it will be within the coming month.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Ashyur, will be missed.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, he will&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Do you think you will be able to replace
him Meya?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;No one can replace Ashyur, I can only
surpass him&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Arorua looked out her window within the Castle.
She stared out and watched the stars dance in the night sky. It
reminded her of when Raziel proposed to her, the stars were as
clear, then as they are now. It saddened her. She had received
the sacrament of purification earlier today, but why did she
still feel these emotions? She got up for a moment and got her
sword the Masamune. She unsheathed it and squeezed the hilt
tightly and once again the holy blade ignited into sky-blue
flames. She resheathed the sword and looked out once again to the
sky and a tear rolled down her cheek. She rubbed her hand and on
it was the blackened ring.<br>
--------------------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Malik. How has Raziel been faring over
the last month?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Quite well, old friend. He is training
some many of the apprentices at the moment. Their skills are
growing in leaps and bounds because of him.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;But..&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Malik smiled. &quot;Nothing gets past you.
Raziel is strong but his flame has dwindled greatly since he
returned. His heart is no longer in what he does.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Sounds familiar&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I have a feeling that all will be better
very soon. You and I can rest finally in the Halls of Jahorn
knowing that we have been surpassed by mighty students.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You've never been wrong Ashyur.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old necromancer smiles greatly and breathes
his last. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I shall see you soon. Old friend&quot;<br>
------------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel and a young Shadow Knight apprentice
were practicing sword skills in the guildhall, when some
commotion started up outside. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Keep practicing, I'll be right back&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes M'lord Raziel&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel went outside and stopped one of the
passerby's. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;What's going on?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;A paladin has been caught at the front
entrance. The council is deciding what to do right now.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;All this fuss for a Puritan?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It's not a Puritan, its an outsider a
High Elf. And the elf has a one of our family crests&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel snapped to attention at this. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;What did you say!?!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I said the guards captured a High
..&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel faded into the shadows. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;How rude.&quot;<br>
--------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Inside the Council Chambers, the 5 Council
members are discussing the recent turn of events. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;We should take precautions, this could be
the fore front of a major assault upon us. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><br>
&quot;One little scraggly elf and everyone gets bent out of
shape. Just kill the little wench and return the crest to whoever
it belongs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Touch one hair on any one who bears a
family crest and death shall fall upon you.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The council turned to the new voice. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Raziel! Leave the chambers at once! This
meeting is for council members only!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I shall leave, but tell what crest was on
the elf?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;If you must know a black starfire diamond
cut to dagger shape.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;...That is my crest.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;All the more reason to kill the elf. If
it's your crest then they may know about your mission, they may
be leading an assault on .GAH AGH...&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The council member begins to gag violently. He
then levitated out of his seat and floated over to Raziel, all
the while desperately clawing at an invisible hand that was
choking him. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Now listen and listen well you old,
decaying, bag of bones. If so much as a hair on her head is
misplaced, I will disembowel you and drain you of your soul! So
you understand me?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;GAH!! Let go o..AAAHH!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The grip on him became tighter. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes!!!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel fades away and the council member drops
to the floor. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Hmm. Ashyur was right as always.&quot;<br>
-------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Arorua paced back and forth through her prison
cell. She wondered what she was going to do. She wondered how she
was going to get out of the cell. The light in the already
darkened room faded for a moment. She turned towards the door,
and a figure was standing in the shadows. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You shouldn't have come, Elf&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;What I choose to do is my right.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;And it is that right which could get you
killed. Why have you come here?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I have come to follow my heart. I love
the man who gave me this ring. I love him even though we are
opposites. Even though we are supposed to be enemies.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;In all my days, I would have never
thought to hear those words. Arorua&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The figure moved closer and into the light. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Raziel!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Hi Ar. You took a big risk coming here.
If you hadn't kept my crest...&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I know, but it was worth the risk. I love
you Raziel and I realized that nothing can change that.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel smiled and brought his hands together.
They shimmered slightly as he then separated them. The bars in
the cell began to bend and in a moment a hole was formed. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Always the show off.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Arorua stepped out and they embraced. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I'm glad your back. But we have 3 small
tasks ahead of us now.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;What are those?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;First we are going to have to talk to the
Council. Next, I want to marry you in the way of my people. And
three...well I shall leave that one up to your imagination.&quot;
Raziel smiles evilly at Arorua. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">She reddens a bit. &quot;You are so bad.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I wouldn't have it any other way. Now.
Hold my hand&quot; She squeezes his hand. &quot;Ready?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes.&quot; They both fade into the
shadows.<br>
------------------------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Council is once again disrupted as Raziel
and Arorua fade into the chambers. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Raziel! Why have you released the elven
wench from the prison!?!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel's eyes flash brightly and the council
member feels himself being choked again. &quot;Watch your
tongue!&quot; The council member is released and he gasps for
breath. &quot;I have released her because she is the one I have
chosen to be my mate.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;WHAT! You would dare to sully our city
with elven trash? And a Paladin at that?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel's eyes glow brightly again and the
council member cringes slightly. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Who I chose for a mate, is exactly that
my choice.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Meya steps forward. &quot;Raziel is right. But
we reserve the right to choose if you will stay within our walls.
So let us put it to a vote.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The council agreed and they call their votes.
The first was Council Member Alshaquir. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Alshaquir looks at Raziel with contempt &quot;I
vote against.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Then Council Member Talnoshier &quot;I vote
for.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Then Commandant Seyjuah &quot; I vote
against.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Then it was Meya's turn &quot;My inexperience
prohibits me for taking a vote. I pass my vote to Lord
Shroudstorm.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Then it was Malik's turn. He looked at Raziel
and Arorua standing side by side. He smiled. He moved to them. He
knelt down before Arorua and kissed her hand &quot;Our City would
be honored to have you with us. My vote is for.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Commandant Seyjuah grimaced slightly. &quot;So
the council has decided. Arorua and Raziel may stay. So mote it
be.&quot;<br>
---------------------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Night began to fall upon the continent. And
underneath the training grounds, Raziel and Arorua are walking
down a flight of stairs. They continue down the winding staircase
until the come out to an open area. They stop at a small
open-ended platform overlooking the area. To their right there
are more stairs leading down into a small pool with a grassy area
adjacent to it. The moon sparkles off the pool, gently lighting
the area. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;This is beautiful Raziel.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes it is. Are you ready for this
Arorua?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, I am. But are we the only ones here?
Doesn't anyone watch?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes we are all alone. That is one of our
traditions. The couple should be alone while performing the
ceremony. It gives a sense of serenity, don't you think? </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, it does.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel holds Arorua for a moment and turns her,
so her back is facing the open end of the platform. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;A marriage, is based on 2 things. Love
and trust. Love got us both here. But trust is something that has
to be earned. So, I have to know if you trust Arorua.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, I trust you Raziel&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It is easily spoken, but not so easily
proven. Arorua, if you truly love and trust me. Then step back
off the platform.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">She looked into his eyes and breathed deeply.
And then she stepped off. Then she waited for herself to hit the
pool, but she didn't fall. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel smiled happily at her and then stepped
off the platform himself. They both floated in the air above the
pool. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Glass?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;No, its all me&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;O my.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel held her in his arms and gently floated
over to the center of the room. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;This beautiful Raziel.&quot; She leaned
her head against his chest. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;And it's about to look a whole lot
better. Close your eyes.&quot; As she did she felt his hand run
across her eyelids. &quot;Okay. You can open them&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Instead of seeing Raziel, she saw both of them
floating in midair. She panicked slightly. &quot;Its okay. I just
bound our vision to something else&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Ok.&quot; She relaxed and sighed
contently as she watched the view slowly pan around them and
slowly begin to float upward. She was about to ask what had he
attached their vision too when she saw some shimmering orbs
beginning to float up from the pool and circle them. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Willowisps&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The wisp began to float aimlessly throughout
the room sometimes passing right above them, sometimes doing a
circle around them, and a few times underneath them. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;O...I knew I should have worn something
underneath these robes&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel chuckled slightly, then ran his hand
across her eyes again. Her vision shifted back to normal. He then
repeated the same to himself. They looked into each other's eyes.
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Arorua, do you take me to be your
husband, to have and to hold, to love and adore, from now and
until forever?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes I do.&quot; She said and squeezed him
tightly. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Raziel, do you take me to be your wife,
to have and to hold, to love and adore, from now and until
forever?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, I do&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Then from now and until forever we are
husband and wife.&quot; The kissed once more and held each other
as the glowing wisps danced around them. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">----------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font size="3">It was well after midnight, when Raziel exited
his quarters above the training grounds. He quietly closed the
door, so would not awake Arorua. He walked out to the training
grounds and looked up into the stars. The sound of footfalls came
behind him. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You have an interesting choice in a mate
Raziel. I would have never expected a High Elf, let alone a Grail
Knight.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Strange choices in mates seems run in the
family, Father&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel turns to face Malik. Malik chuckles.
&quot;Yes it does.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Was mother worth the fight against the
council?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;A thousand times over.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Why didn't you rescue her?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I didn't even know she was alive until, I
found you. But that is no excuse. If I could turn the hands of
time, I would go back and save her. But I cannot, I can only hope
that she is happy in the next life.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I hope so too.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Raziel turns back and looks back up at the
stars. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The halls of Jahorn are shining brightly
tonight Raziel.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;They are expecting another to grace
them.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Do you know who they are expecting?&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*<br>
Raziel slowly turns back to Malik, his armor gathering on him as
he turns. He faces Malik, his armor completed enshrouding him,
and he unsheathes his sword. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You.&quot;<br>

Chapter 17 Embers of Erudin<br>
--------------------------- </p>

<p>The dust was beginning to settle in the city of Paineel. It
had been only a few hours since the attack by the Puritans of
Erudin. In the rubble that was once the Council chambers, the
members of the Council are deciding how to proceed. </p>

<p>&quot; Our forces are down to a fifth of what they once were!
Even at full strength we couldn't retaliate!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Our people have been massacred. Women, children spread
across the ground like whitewash. I will not stand for
this!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don't like this any more then you do. But we don't
have the forces to attack Erudin!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Look around this city! This city was founded on the
basis of acquiring of all forms of Knowledge. We have the power
to replenish our forces and double it over. We will used their
own against them!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You have gone mad! Even I detest the very thought of
summoning back Grail Knights. It's horrid. To mock the very being
of the highest ranks of knight. I despise the Puritans as much as
any of you, but I will not lower ourselves to using Black Grail
Knights!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It is not your choice Alshaquir.&quot; Meya interrupted
&quot;Who and what is produced by Necromancy is my territory. In
fact you have no say in these affairs, you are spineless little
worm. You are a disgrace to your position and your
predecessor.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why you wench! How dare you insult me! With Commandant
Seyjuah dead, I am the head of this Council. And I will not have
my people butchered or disgraced any further! And most especially
I will not let him lead any assaults now or ever! He is the
failure amongst us! He has lost 1 of his apprentices and he could
not even protect you or his mate from a single intru..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Raziel's eyes flashes demonically through
his armor. Alshaquir cowers and backs up from Raziel. But he
stops when Raziel's eyes flash again, and an invisible hand
begins to crush his throat. &quot;I tire of you Alshaquir.&quot;
Alshaquir screams as his skin begins to burn. &quot;Your clucking
tongue, is a mockery to every thing Paineel stands for. As of
this moment, your services are no longer needed!&quot; Alshaquir
screams even louder, his skin blistering and burning. Alshaquir
collapses to the ground smoking, his body twitching slightly. </p>

<p>Raziel turns back to the other Council members. &quot;We march
upon Erudin at last light.&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------- </p>

<p>The door to the great Vault opens and light spills into the
chamber. Raziel walks inside. Arorua still lay inside the
chamber. Still stuck in her final pose. Raziel kneels down and
scoops her up into his arms. He looks at her for a few moments. </p>

<p>&quot;Rest well Arorua. I shall you see again someday. Until
then I will make sure whoever did this shall live in agony for
eternity. This is my final promise to you. </p>

<p>Then they both fade away into the shadows.<br>
------------------------------------- </p>

<p>Across the great oceans, several hours and continents away.
King Tearis Thex is awoken by some disturbance, taking place in
the castle. He exits his chambers and moves to stop one of his
servants. But his advisor Caerdwill intercepts him. </p>

<p>&quot;M'lord&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What is all this ruckus?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Some one has open the crypt of the knights&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What!?! Who would do such a thing!&quot; </p>

<p>Caerdwill hesitated. </p>

<p>&quot;What is it Caerdwill? Do you know?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes sire. Some seeking to put one of our knights to
final rest.&quot; </p>

<p>The King was stopped for a moment. But he collected himself.
&quot;Show me to the crypt.&quot; </p>

<p>Caerdwill and the King left the upper portion of the castle
and began a descent into the depths of Felwithe. They went around
to the back of the Mountains, which bordered the city. In the
mountains was a small waterfall and behind the falls was the
crypt of the Grail Knights. The large stone doors were swung wide
open. </p>

<p>&quot;Stay here Caerdwill&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes M'lord&quot; </p>

<p>The King entered the crypt and moved down a small flight of
stairs. The ancient lamps were alit and blazing brightly. Moving
forward and rounding a small corner he came upon a figure
crouched over a tomb. The king stopped and realized who the
figure was and who was in the tomb. </p>

<p>&quot;How dare you tarnish these walls with your presence! You
dare show yourself after all that you have done!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I come to lay down my love within the place she deserves
her final rest.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I should have you executed for your crimes! You have
tainted one of Tunare's holiest and then had her butchered! You
are the lowest form of dog that there is.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel still crouching over Arorua's wept a tear. &quot;Maybe
your right. She would still be alive, had it not been for me. Had
I not taken her from this place or failed to protect her.. But
there is nothing I can do about the past. I can only concern
myself about the future and my promise.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And what would you know about promises.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You hold such animosity for me and such fierce
protection of your people... I can only hope to fulfil my promise
to protect our child. But I cannot let her stay within Paineel.
It is in shambles and only exposes her to great danger..and what
I must do now will expose her even more still......&quot; </p>

<p>The king notices for the first time that he and Raziel are not
the only ones in the crypt. He sees beside Raziel is a small
basket containing a small child. Raziel moves away from Arorua's
tomb and picks up the child. And he moves to the King and hands
him Leylia. </p>

<p>&quot;Please, Protect her. Protect her like you do your
people.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Is this what they teach you Heretics, have a child and
abandon it?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No..They teach us. It takes a village to rear a child,
but if the village it self is a danger. Move to another
village.&quot; Raziel smiles &quot;Paineel, Myself and my fate
are all a danger to her. Faydwer is safe.&quot; Raziel reaches up
and rubs Leylia. She coos in her sleep. </p>

<p>Raziel reaches into his shirt and pulls out a small pendant.
&quot;Reyas&quot; The pendant flashes and a raven appears on
Raziel's shoulder. </p>

<p>/You called?/ </p>

<p>&quot;This is my final command. I release you from myself and
bind you to Leylia. Protect her and when the time is right lead
her so she may find her past.&quot; </p>

<p>/Yes. I understand/ </p>

<p>Raziel takes the pendant and places it on top of Leylia. The
pendant shimmers once again, stirring Leylia. Reyas's ravens form
upon Raziel's shoulder shimmers and then in a flash disappears.
In another flash, a small puppy appears at the King's feet. </p>

<p>&quot;Good bye my little one..Leylia&quot; He moves forward
closer to the King and fades away into the shadows. </p>

<p>The King stands holding Leylia. The King tickles her nose and
she giggles. &quot;Well little one. What a future you have.&quot;
He exits the crypt followed by the puppy.<br>
------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p>Upon the training grounds of Paineel. The retaliatory army
prepares itself for battle. Only a few thousand strong. They are
uncertain of the coming battle, but never the less their hatred
for the Puritans and their recent actions fills them with anger
and courage. The last of daylight begins to dwindle away. A
shadow whisks across the lines and gathers in front of the
troops. The shadows gather and form a figure in jet-black armor.
The remaining Council members gather around the figure. </p>

<p>&quot;You are here, the people were getting restless.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It matters not now. We march in a few minutes. Summon
our legions then return to the city.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No. I am coming along&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You have no place amongst this battle Meya. Summon the
Black Grail Knights and the legions, then go to the city.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;NO! I will not stand aside. I want atonement as
well!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You can get your vengeance through the legions. I have
lost one person who means much too me, I shall not lose
another.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I lost my son Raziel!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Melchoir?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes. A grail knight during the beginning of the attack
cut him down. He was just a small child.. He did not
deserve.....&quot; Meya began to cry her emotions overtaking her.
&quot; I want them to burn. I want to exact vengeance
myself!&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel looked into her eyes, which burned with hatred. He knew
the feeling and he also knew that nothing would let her soul rest
at ease unless she went with them. &quot;Alright. Summon the
legions then mount up.&quot; </p>

<p>Meya under her tears smiled. She turned to the bodies of the
fallen Puritans, the common soldiers and paladins. She mana began
to flow through her body and the wind crackled with power. </p>

<p>&quot;Creas.. malsho.....sodurina....necromona!&quot; She
slammed her staff into the ground and the bodies began to move.
The dead began to moan as they rose. Rotting flesh and shattered
bone clambered together. Underneath the training grounds, bones
began to form together as well and skeleton warriors began to
rise from the earth. </p>

<p>Meya turned to the bodies of the fallen Grail Knights. She
began to weave a stronger spell. One of the few spells that the
people of Paineel banned. It was a spell that allowed them to
crack the holy barriers placed on the highest forms of Knights,
The Grail Knights. Even though the people of Paineel despised the
Puritans. They did respect the Grail Knights and until now they
were the only corpses that the necromancers of Paineel would not
tamper with. But the attack changed all that. The Grail Knights
rose, mounting their undead steeds. They shimmered with unholy
power. Meya now finished summoning the undead legions, mounted
her horse. </p>

<p>Raziel turned to the army. &quot;WE MARCH UPON ERUDIN!!! BURN
IT TO THE GROUND!!!!!&quot; </p>

<p>The troops roared in approval and they began to leave the
confines of Paineel. Their numbers tripled by the undead that
encompassed them.<br>
-------------------------------------- </p>

<p>Just outside the gates of Erudin, two of the entrance guards
were discussing the success of the recent attack on Paineel. </p>

<p>&quot;That was a great battle. They are going to fear us
now.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I got me 5 of them before the call back.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I got me 8 and some tail too. Man..They got some
good looking women down there. You would think that all that
worshipping the dead stuff would make them look like old hags,
but no. O well I showed them a few things. They were calling for
Elrossi when I was done.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Right on! ..Hey do you hear that? O...Shi..&quot; His
head exploded as a bolt of mana ripped through it. </p>

<p>&quot;Rick!!! O man! What the hell happened&quot; The guard
knelt over his friend. &quot;By the gods!!!! What is thi..
GAAAAAAAH&quot; A blade ripped though his stomach. Blood poured
from his mouth and as the light faded from his eyes. He saw his
friend extract his blade and begin to stand up, he was now one of
the undead. The guard collapsed and then soon joined his friend
into the undead ranks. </p>

<p>&quot;LOOSE!!!&quot; Raziel's voice boomed across the forest.
And hundreds of bolts of mana flew into the mountain walls of
Erudin. The entrance collapsed leaving a huge hole in the wall;
the entrance to Erudin was now laid bare. </p>

<p>&quot;LOOSE!!!&quot; another volley of mana slammed into the
upper platform of Paineel, creating a scalable wall for the
troops. The Undead began to pour through the open hole. They
scaled the wall and began to enter the city of Erudin. Paladins
and Clerics who had been roused by the noise swarmed to meet the
undead threat. Alarms began to sound. </p>

<p>&quot;THEY&quot;RE HERE!!! CITIZENS FALL BACK TO THE
CASTLE!!!!! FALL BACK!! FALL BA...NO!!! PLAEASE NO!!!
GAAAAAA!!!&quot; </p>

<p>The clerics began to chant powerful spells drawing upon the
winds of mana. </p>

<p>&quot;Simple undead..BEGONE RETURN TO WENCE YOU CAME! TURN
UNDEAD!!!&quot; Bluish holy light leapt from the clerics and
collided with the incoming undead troops. The undead began to
howl as they began to dissolve away and then crashed to the
ground shattering into pieces. </p>

<p>One of the clerics smiled. &quot;Is this the best the can
do?&quot; He stopped smiling when he heard an unnatural whinny of
a horse. Terror struck into his eyes when he saw Grail Knights on
their steeds coming up the wall. &quot;By Elrossi!
They..They..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Think about it later!&quot; barked a senior cleric
&quot;TURN UNDEAD!&quot; More light leapt from the clerics and
struck the Black Grail Knights. The Knights rode straight through
unfazed by the magic. Then they rode straight through the clerics
chopping them in half, spilling them across the ground. </p>

<p>More and more undead poured into the city followed by the
soldiers of Paineel. Raziel followed them. &quot;TAKE ANYTHING OF
VALUE!!! TURN THE REST INTO ASHES!!! CONFINE THE WOMEN AND
CHILDREN!!!!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Heretic dog! You have met your match!&quot; A templar
charged Raziel sword held at high ready. Just then a figure
whisked in front of Raziel, blocking the Templar. </p>

<p>&quot;Maxim! Continue on inside! Ill deal with the
Templar!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes sir!&quot; </p>

<p>Maxim shoved the Templar back causing him to lose his footing
and crash to the ground. Maxim then continued on with the rest of
the troops inside to the castle. </p>

<p>&quot;Now. You die Templar.' Raziel raised his sword to
strike. &quot;NO!!! I'LL GET YOU !!!!&quot; Another Templar
charged from behind and slashes at Raziel's midsection. But met
only air as Raziel faded into the shadows. Then Raziel's blade
went through the Templar's back and then it detached his head.
Spraying blood across the other. The first Templar terrified got
up and<br>
began to run. &quot;Were do you think your going?&quot; Mana
flowed to Raziel's hands. **&quot;PRESSURE CANNON!!!&quot; Three
spheres of mana leapt from his hands and sailed towards the
fleeing Templar. The first shattered one of the Templar's legs,
the second cut through his midsection. And the last sprayed his
head across the city. </p>

<p>Raziel laughed evilly and then turned to a large building
towering beside him. &quot;The famed library of Erudin. The
answers I seek shall be there.&quot; He faded once again into the
shadows.<br>
------------------------------------ </p>

<p>&quot;Hurry! Gather what you can carry and get to the boat
docks!!&quot; shouted the librarian to his patrons and students. </p>

<p>&quot;Sound advice.&quot; Came a voice from behind him. He
turned and faced a large figure in dark armor. The figure quickly
grasped him by the throat. &quot;Please! Don't kill me!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I won't kill you, unless you withhold the information I
seek.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What do you want!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Tell me..&quot;The armored figure lifted his hand
towards the wall and a beam of mana burned a design into the
wall. It was claw encompassing a small sphere.&quot;Who does this
symbol belong too.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I..I dont know!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;YOU LIE!!!&quot; The librarian screamed as waves of pain
coursed through him. &quot;Your people hired some that bore this
symbol. Now who is it!!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Its..the symbol of Veeshan!!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why did you hire a dog of Veeshan! Why bring an outsider
into our affairs!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We didn't hire him!!! He came to us several months ago.
Got the people stirred up for battle. Preaching about the
Twilight!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What twilight?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;An old wives tale. It says that two children born of the
purest light and the darkest dark, shall give rise to the
Twilight of the Gods.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now. Tell me how do I open a gate to Veeshan's
realm?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What? You can't reach Veeshan's domain.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;STOP YOUR LIEING!!&quot; More waves of pain ripped
through the Librarian. &quot;This library contains millions of
testaments and tomes of ancient lore. And a true librarian has
read every one. Now tell HOW DO OPEN THE GATE TO THE PLANE OF
SKY!!!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I swear! It's impossible! Veeshan's realm can not be
accessed through a gate. You have to petition the dragon council.
The Ring of Scale.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;AND??&quot; </p>

<p>'The Ring of Scale is in Kunark somewhere in the Skyfire
mountains! It's all I know! I swear to you!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If you've lied to me librarian..&quot; The figures eyes
flashed with energy, then the figure realized the librarian. And
he crashed to the ground. &quot;GO!!! GO TO THE DOCKS AND LEAVE
THIS CONTINENT!! IT BELONGS TO US NOW AND FOREVER!&quot; </p>

<p>The librarian trembled violently and then scrambled out of the
library. As he exited the library, he turned back to look at it
one more time and to his horror, the towering building exploded
with an unnatural force. As if some type of storm that had raged
through inside it. He pushed back his tears and ran madly for the
docks<br>
----------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p>The ocean waves were very calm that night, perfect weather for
sailing. But it was little comfort for the few remaining people
of Erudin. Women, children and those that were too weak or could
not fight had been all shoved into one of Erudin's only boats and
cast out to sea. They would eventually hit the shores of
Antonica, but for now they could only watch the flames which
shined brightly in the night sky. The city of Erudin stood no
longer.<br>

------------------- </p>

<p>It is the next day, the fires that raged through Erudin have
subsided, and all that is left is ash and smoldering embers.
Inside Paineel, there is great celebration. After hundreds of
years of oppression and hatred, they are free. They no longer
have to live in wary of there lives, they're children can play in
safety. They know now that there is nothing that can hurt them
anymore. The friends and family that died in the Puritans last
assault have been avenged, their deaths no longer empty and
meaningless. </p>

<p>But not everyone is rejoicing. Raziel is still deprived of his
atonement. But now he knows were to look and who to seek.
However, Raziel is unwary of the coming days, he know that what
he must do will push him to his limits and beyond. He wants more
strength; he wants the way to damn his foe for all eternity&#133;.
</p>

<p>Raziel exits the necromancer hall and starts toward the
celebrating crowd in the city center. Meya stops him. </p>

<p>&quot;What were you doing?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Something that does not concern you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Anything that goes on in Paineel is my concern. I am the
rule Paineel, now Raziel.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations. Now move.&quot; </p>

<p>Meya stands still, her eyes gaze deep into his. She sees what
he wants. </p>

<p>&quot;I forbid you to leave Raziel. We have to much rebuilding
to do.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You forbid me?&quot; Raziel laughs &quot;I'd like to see
you try&quot; He shimmers with power briefly. Meya does not
waiver. </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel. I know what you feel. I know that you must seek
out the one who killed Arorua but..there is so much we must do
now. Our city is in shambles, and our forces are next to nothing.
Plus you must continue to train your apprentices.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Meya, I am not a carpenter, nor will I ever be. Maxim
has already learned all that I can teach him He can teach Reva
and the new apprentice. I have nothing left in this city to
attend too.&quot; </p>

<p><br>
&quot;Raziel..please..I beg you don't do this. You could be
killed.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I could die at any time, it only matters how. I'm going
and there is nothing you can do or say to stop me.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel walks past her and heads into the mirror teleporter.
&quot;Damn it Raziel!!' </p>

<p>Meya pushes through the crowd and heads into the mirror. When
she comes through the other side. Raziel is no were to be seen.
&quot;RAZIEL!!&quot; She collects herself and then begins to
weave a spell. In a moment she knows Raziel's location. She runs
to the ancient elevator and inserts her key and turns it. The
elevator rumbles to life once again. </p>

<p>She taps her foot impatiently as the elevator slowly makes its
way up to the surface. Then she dashes into the training grounds
and then turns into the ancient room, which contained a small
pool. Raziel was standing on an open platform with his back
facing towards her. </p>

<p>&quot;You don't give up do you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't be a good ruler if I did&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; That is true.&quot; He sighs heavily. As memories from
across the years flood to him in the room. The very room reminds
him of Arorua, mostly due to the act that they married each other
in the room. </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel. If you won't stay. Please tell were are you
going.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; To the ring of Scale, but first have to make a quick
stop to have a chat with Cazic-Thule&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;WHAT!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If I am going to get atonement, I must have all the
power I can acquire. So I must get the.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Kirosawa. The demon-blade. But if even if you can wield
it..&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes.. I know. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It's my choice Meya.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I won't allow it! I won't call for the gate opening
ritual. I may not be able to keep you from leaving, but you cant
goto fear with out the strength of our people to open the
gate!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Really? Then you don't mind that I took this then&quot;
Raziel reaches into a small pouch and pulls out a small gem. </p>

<p>&quot;A gatestone! That's why you were in the hall. Why did
you take it?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I already told you. I'm going to the Plane of
Fear.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel fades slightly and then he reappears in full armor. He
outstretches his hand with the gatestone and begins to chant. </p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing!?!&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel continues to chant and the gatestone begins to flash.
His chanting grows louder and louder, in synch with the flashing
of the stone. Then suddenly the gatestone shatters and a crimson
gate opens. Flames leap about inside the gate. </p>

<p>&quot;Good bye Meya&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel steps into the gate and the gate collapses. </p>

<p>&quot;Raziel&#133;&quot; She was awestruck, she couldn't
believe at what she had seen. Raziel had opened a gate to fear by
himself. She couldn't help but tremble at the revaluation of just
how powerful he was. And in some ways she felt sorry for any one
who crossed his path.<br>
-------------------------- </p>

<p>There was nothing. For a long period of time there was
nothing, then flame white-hot flames leapt about. Raziel stood
up, the flames licking at his armor and heating it. He then made
his way through the flames toward a long dirt tunnel. He
continued unfaltering and soon made it to the tunnel. The ground
hisses and crackles as it burns underneath his superheated armor.
He continues down through the dark tunnel, listening to the
screams and shouts that echoed through it. The tunnel soon ended
with an enormous plain. The screams grew louder. </p>

<p>Raziel begins to shout out into the darkness. &quot;CAZIC!!!
WHERE ARE YOU!!! STOP THIS HIDING!!! OR IS THE GOD OF FEAR AFRAID
OF HIS OWN PRODIGY?&quot; </p>

<p>A voice boomed across the dark field. &quot;So, my reaver
returns. You have done well amongst the Plane of Norrath.
Thousands now cower in the sight of the shadows. But your work is
not nearly complete, Tell me why have you entered my
realm!!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I have come for your blade! The Kirosawa!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And what mortal can wield my demon-blade?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I can&quot; </p>

<p>Cazic-Thule begins to laugh, his voice causing the plane to
shake. &quot;No mere mortal can wield my blade. For even
considering the thought, you shall feel the agony of fear
unleashed. Lets see what power your soul can bestow upon my
denizens. PAIN!!<br>
SUFFERING!!! Deal with this whelp.&quot; </p>

<p>Two forms leap out of the shadows and dash toward Raziel.
Raziel's eyes flash brightly and one of the forms bursts into
flames, screeching madly and writhing on the dirt. The other
accelerates and slashes at Raziel. Raziel parries the slashes
easily and then sends his sword through the form. The form drops
to the ground in two pieces. </p>

<p>&quot;IS THIS ALL? I WANT YOU TO BE MORE SERIOUS!! OR WERE YOU
SERIOUS AND HIS WAS ALL YOU HAD?&quot; </p>

<p>Cazic-Thule laughs again, shaking the plane. &quot;Look
again.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel glances down at the bodies. The two forms begin to
waiver and they melt into the shadows. Then claws begin to leap
out of the shadows at Raziel. Raziel dodges the attacks and then
catapults himself into the air. The two shadow beasts follow suit
and begin to spring off the walls toward Raziel. One reaches him
first and cuts at his midsection. Raziel blocks it and then
grasps the beasts claw. His blade then severs the beast's arm. </p>

<p>The beast howls as black blood flies from its stump and the
beast plummets to the ground. The other reaches Raziel and claws
him across the chest. Sparks fly as its claws rake across his
breastplate. Raziel bashes it on the head stunning it.**
&quot;Pressure Cannon!&quot; A mana sphere leaps from his hand
and smashing into the Shadow Beast sending it down into the wall
and crashing it through. </p>

<p>Raziel hovers in the air. Then the other beast leaps from the
darkness below him quickly scaling the wall and then dashes into
the hole that was just formed. A small flash of light escapes the
hole. Then Raziel plummets to the ground as something smashes him
in the back. Then the Shadow beast grabs him by the foot and
flings him into the wall. </p>

<p>The shadow beast flashes a demonic smile at Raziel, its mouth
filled with razor sharp teeth. It then glows brightly and it
hurls several waves of razor sharp spikes at Raziel. Unable to
move quickly enough; they pierce through his armor and blood
pours out. The Shadow beast falls on top of him and yanks out the
spikes, spraying blood across the plain. Then grasping Raziel by
the head, it flings him to the ground. The Beast jumps of the
fall and begins to fall down, ready to pounce on top of him. </p>

<p>Raziel rolls out of the way. And the beast slams into the
ground. It turns and stares at Raziel, bearing its razor-sharp
teeth at him. Then it splits apart back into to two. Both beasts
begin to bound towards Raziel. They sail through the air with
claws at full extension. They cut through empty air as Raziel
fades away into the shadows. They bound to a quick stop and
reverse direction. They resume their attack and leap at Raziel
again. </p>

<p>Raziel catches them by their throats and begins to crush them.
The beasts clamp down on his arms, their teeth going straight
through his armor and letting blood flow freely. Raziel crushes
their throats even harder and his eyes go white. Energy courses
from the two beasts momentarily and then he lets them go. Two
smoking husks smash into the ground. Raziel turns away from the
husks and wipes the blood of his armor. His wounds also gone with
the blood. </p>

<p>&quot;IS THIS THE BEST YOU CAN DO!&quot; </p>

<p>The ancient god laughs once again shaking the plane. &quot;You
have proven yourself to be a true reaver, but do you realize what
wielding my blade means mortal?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't be here if I didn't&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Then come face me&quot; booms the god's voice from
behind him. </p>

<p>Raziel turns to face Cazic-Thule the ancient god of Fear. Who
now towers over him. Raziel levitates off the ground to hover in
front of the god. </p>

<p>&quot;I tire of your games. Give me the Kirosawa.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No mortal. Take it.&quot; The god held up a large
katana. </p>

<p>Raziel drops his blade and it clatters on the ground. He moves
over to the god's hand and rips the Kirosawa from it. The sword
pulses black in his hand and then ignites into flames. </p>

<p>&quot;The Kirosawa has spoken. Your soul belongs to it. Now
begone from realm!&quot; The god vanishes into the shadows. </p>

<p>Raziel holds the demon-blade and stares at it. The black
flames leap freely from the blade, alit with the power of soul.
Raziel smiles for a moment and then laughs into the darkness.
&quot;I'M COMING FOR YOU! AND THERE IS NOWHERE TO HIDE!&quot;<br>
