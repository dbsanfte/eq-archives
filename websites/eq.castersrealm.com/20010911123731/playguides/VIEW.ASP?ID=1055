  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>If there is one defining spell of the Shadow Knight, it has to be Feign Death. <p> <p>

Level 30 is the level that every SK has been waiting for... Feign, Gather Shadows, and (if you have one) Dark Reaver procs.  Of the three, though, Feign is by far (IMO) the best.  Invis stops working in some of the higher level dungeons... but Feign will fool things even on the planes. <p> <p>

However, the spell takes some getting used to, unless you have played a Monk.  (Necros don't have many of the same experiences, because they usually stand up and just gate--but more on that in a sec.)  I learned most of this the hard way, so I thought I might save you a few deaths. <p> <p>

First of all, max your Abjuration score before you hit level 30.  You will be thankful you did, when you get FD.  Next, *always* keep it memmed.  SKs don't have so many useful spells that they can't save a spot for Feign.  With Feign constantly memmed, you will very rarely die.  I, for example (at 39th), have died once since starting level 35 hell... and that once was because I stood back up after Feigning to try to help out my group.  Finally, make sure you have the highest AC possible.  This is a good rule for any tank--Stats suck.  AC is your most important stat, second only to your level. :)  Get a high AC, and you will live to Feign.  <p> <p>

Now, let us say you are in a normal group.  The first thing you do--Volunteer to pull.  SKs and Monks are some of the best pullers in the game, not even considering *real* Feign pulling.  Why?  Well, because if you get an overpull, you don't have to take it back to your group and cross your fingers.  You just Feign Death. <p> <p>

If you are pulling and get too many mobs, calmly turn to face them.  Make sure they are all in front of you, so that you get to use your defensive skills (parry, dodge, etc.).  Turn off Auto attack.  Then just keep hitting Feign Death.  You WILL be interrupted... but you should get it off eventually. <p> <p>

When your casting goes off, one of three things will happen: <p> <p> <p>

1.  Everything goes smoothly.  (You "die", and nothing sees through it.) <p> <p>

If this is the case, stay on the ground.  The mobs will stand over you for awhile, drooling and looking disappointed that you died so quickly.  Then they will slooooowly wander off.  This is good.  Let them leave, and get all the way back to their spawn points.  Then, if they are relatively low level mobs (under 30), it is safe to just stand up.  If they are high level mobs, you will probably want to /quit... but more on that below. <p> <p> <p>

2.  You Feign successfully, but one mob sees through. <p> <p>

This is bad.  Each time you Feign, all of the monsters get a check to see through the Feign.  From my experience, their chance of success is usually quite low... but sometimes something figures out you are shamming.  It then keeps attacking you... and its companions catch on as soon as it hits you.  Then they ALL come back.  If this happens, stand back up (if you are not standing already, from being hit).  Then you make a choice:  Either bug for the zone, or try to wait on the Feign Death regen time, and try casting it again. <p> <p> <p>

3.  You get the dreaded message:  "Gruulgrul has fallen to the ground!" <p> <p>

This means that you FAILED to Feign.  It happens maybe one in four times... give or take.  You have not fooled anyone--stand up immediately, so they don't get freebie full damage hits on you.  Then face them calmly to wait for Feign regen... or bug for the zone. <p> <p> <p>

Now, if you are in a party, things are slightly different.  You can't just Feign whenever there is trouble, if you are in sight of your group.  If you succeed, everything jumps off you... and on to your casters.  In a group, you are the tank... you have to stay standing until the last minute, if you want to be respected.  If there is trouble and you are with your group, tell everyone else to zone, Evac, whatever, and hold the mobs for as long as you can.  Then, Feign Death.  Your chance of dying is greater this way… but you will also save a lot of lives, and your group will thank you for it. <p> <p>

Now, a few VERY important notes about Feign: <p> <p> <p>

1.  Monsters CAN remember you when you stand up!!! <p> <p>

Do NOT forget this, or you will get a lot of people killed.  The way Feign currently works, it auto-wipes the memory of you from the "hate list" from lower level mobs.  30 and below, I believe.  Anything below 30 almost always forgets you (so long as they are not right next to you when you stand up, of course). <p> <p>

However, higher level mobs will *not* forget you automatically.  They only have a *chance* to forget you when you stand up.  Further, if it is a large group of mobs that you Feigned from, it is *very* likely that at least one will remember you.  And when he comes back to find you, he will bring all of his friends.  <p> <p>

This means that you are only safe for as long as you stay on the ground.  As soon as you stand up, everything that was on you before can re-agro on you, from anywhere in the zone.  <p> <p>

For necromancers, this is not so much a problem... they usually Gate before the stuff returns.  But for an SK... well, you are often back to square one.  <p> <p> <p>

2.  There are several tricks to fix #1, and wipe the agro lists. <p> <p>

First of all, when you stand up, you can re-Feign.  Stand up, Feign, etc.  The more often you repeat this, the more checks you get for the wiping of their memory, and the more likely it is that you are safe. <p> <p>

However, the second trick is much more effective.  While you can't *camp* while Feigned... you *can* /quit.  And, once you /quit out of the game and come back in, the agro list will be cleared, and you will be safe.  However, when you log back in, you will no longer be feigned.  And related to that... <p> <p> <p>

3.  Always try to Feign someplace safe! <p> <p>

Try to get to a place where there are  A) No spawn points, B) No heavy patrols, or C) No players, then Feign.  The goal is to Feign somewhere where, when you stand back up (or log back in), the mobs won't be waiting to greet you. <p> <p>

For example, I accidentally ran into the Champ room in Sol B, not realizing that it was, for once, not camped.  (Woops. :)  I now have three angry Greater Kobalds trying to eat me alive.  Do I:  A)  Feign in the room where I am standing, where the three kobalds spawn, or B)  Run out into the hall and Feign? <p> <p>

It is almost always better to do B).  If I Feign in the room, then when the Kobalds return to their spawn points, thinking I am dead... well, they will still be standing right over me.  But if I Feign in the hall, then when they wander back to their room, they should be out of agro range--a good bit away from me.  I can then clear agro (/quit out, or whatever) and log back in relative safety. <p> <p> <p>

4.  Feign--an Anti-Taunt. <p> <p>

Most of your life will be spent taunting things, and trying to get them pissed at you.  However, there comes a time when the cleric is oom, the monster is Frenzied on you, and you are at half a bubble of life.  The big ogre warrior is at Full Life--he wants to tank!  But the poor guy can't, because the mob is frenzied on you. <p> <p>

Hey, no problem!  Feign Death.  Feign, if successful, wipes you from the agro list.  Basically, it tells the game that you actually have done no damage to that mob.  Thus, the mob leaves you alone... turns around, beats on Mr. Ogre.  If you are feeling brave, you can even stand back up and start hacking again... it should no longer be Frenzied on you.  Think Mem Blur. <p> <p>

BTW, this can also be... er... used creatively, to power level people.  I can hack an Aviak Guard to 5% life, Feign Death, and then let the little 15th level warrior take the last smack at it.  He gets the XP, because I was wiped off the damage list for Feigning. <p> <p> <p>

5.  Spellcasters really screw up Feign. <p> <p>

Just as a cautionary note... I HATE trying to Feign around spellcasting mobs.  This is the problem: You have to time it correctly.  If a Judicator starts casting Wrath while you are "alive", and then your Feign goes off... his Wrath will still target you, and hit you, when he finishes casting, even though you are "dead" on the ground. <p> <p>

When that happens, you take damage.  When you take damage, everything realizes that you are shamming, and it is a game of troll-pinata all over again. <p> <p>

The only way to do it (without relying on luck), is to wait until *after* a spellcasting mob has hit you with a spell, and isn't casting another for a second.  You then have to quickly Feign before he starts casting again. <p> <p> <p>

Well, that is more than enough for now, eh? :)  I will leave Feign Pulling to someone else--this is already long enough. :)
