    <td>
    <small><hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0"><P>
    <P>     Hello everyone.  Right now I am at level 28 and have been fighting in Cazic Thule since 20.  I wouldn't suggest going into Cazic to solo, due to sometimes uncontrollable pulls of up to 5 lizzards level 20-26.  So I will be focusing mainly on the group aspects.  I believe that if you are 18-23 in level, you should try and get spawns in Lake Rathe, great xp and decent loot.  Problem is that there are a lot of people in that zone for the amount of spawns there are.  I play an ogre, so CT is great to check on my way to Lake Rathe.  I had a hard time finding a group in Cazic that wanted me at levels 20-22, I hope it is different for you.  One of the biggest problems in CT is the train factor.  If you don't have quite a few hp, you won't survive a train, which is why it is not suggested that anyone under level 20 go in. My personal opinion is that you should be at least 22 before seriously considering heading down ther.  Once you start getting into the 23-28th levels, people will ask you to join quite regularly.  I have even received tells while in South Ro to group from people doing the /who all 23 shaman bit.                                                      <P>  Knowing your role in Cazic is another essential grouping strategy, as there are many races and classes that know of the wonderful fruits this dungeon has to offer.  As a shaman, you, in the past 15-20 levels have started to understand that we are kind of the "thrown in a little bit of everything" magic users.  As the more physical "dark races", we are better off than most other races in terms of strength and stamina.  This is a great attribute for us because we can be somewhat effective tanks.  Tanks not so much as offense, because we are starting to suck compared to most melee classes after level 20, but defensively.  Depending on your stamina, we have quite a few hit points with which to be battered on while the warrior takes a breather or gets healed.  This is a great thing, because it is a big time waster to have 2 of the 6 in the group down to a half bubble, sitting and healing, while everyone else is at full health.  Try and spread the love a little.  Most of the time you should be at the front lines with the tanks, dishing out blows... you don't hit as fast or hard and don't have taunt, so you are basically an extra low level hitter. that can do an extra 1/3 of the warrior damage.

   <P>  Your main role though, if grouped with tanks, is to heal them (duh).  I would say that 95% of all warriors would group with you, even if they are 10 levels higher, just for your healing. At level 24 you get regeneration.  This is the best thing to cast on a warrior hands down.  It regenerates 400 hp in 8 minutes for 100 mana.  This beats your level 14 heal and even you greater heal at 29.  You should always have this on yourself as well, using cannibalize.  Quick math makes this a very efficient juggle providing 200 mana for 100 mana in 8 minutes.  Always cast this on the warriors and make sure they tell you when it's out, because it saves you mana.  If you have a bard in the group, then you don't need regen on.  Regen and the bard's group heal do stack, but you need to cast regen on the target frist and then walk into the AE of the bard song. I have never done this because at this level, the bard's heal kicks butt and is equal or greater in strength to your regen (and doesn't cost any mana).

<P>     If you have a druid or cleric in the group, you will most likely become the backup healer during battle, casting regen during downtime.  The druids and clerics aren't as physical as you, so they can stay back and monitor  a little better the overall group's hp.  If you need to, you can step back and cast a heal or two, but your mana should be spent with DD, buffs and regen.  Dot's are useful, but I tend to just blast the guys with frost strike near the end of the fight.  If you have a druid or a ranger in the group, you don't need root, since they have gotten used to using ensnare quite effectively.  I was told that root cancels ensnare, so don't use it, but keep it memmed nonetheless.  I also use walking sleep a bit too.  It lowers attack speed of the mob and can save you and your party a bit of mana.

   <P> If you have a wizard, magician, necro, enchanter in your group, you don't need to rely so much on your DOT's or DD and can save mana for healing, (or nuking a mob off of the magic user when they blow it and attract too much attention.  I grouped with a necro a couple of times and found that they are excellent conversion jugglers like us =).  I was told not to heal him even though he was 50 hp away from death, because of his life sucking spells.  This takes some more pressure off of you, which is good.  Your prime concern with an offensive caster (as with the rest of the group) is to keep the mobs off of them.  Often the warrior will turn his back on 2 or 3 monsters to taunt and whack on the one that is intent on destroying your little "Tim".  You should be the same, use Frost strike on the guy and get him off, you can take 3 times as many blows as your feeble bodied braniac brother.

<P>    Which leads me into our final role: Buff master supreme.  We are the best buffers in the game, hands down.  If you want to make a warrior piss his pants with joy, go down the line with your buffs on him.  It takes about 3 bubbles of mana, but most of them last for about 40 minutes.  Regen and SoW are essentials, there should be no reason why these spells aren't on the tank at all times (except for the bard scenario with regen).  I have a buff section in my spell book with the 5 great buffs you get from 14-24.  Monkey, Spirit Str, Ox, Cat, and Protect.  you won't need endure magic in cazic when fighting in the courtyard or against gators.  If you have a few tanks, depending on the class and their role, buff accordingly.  Use monkey and str on rogues.  I feel that the 3 best buffs for a tank, including rangers are dex, str, and protect.  This will allow them to hit much more effectively, meaning less hp wasted on monsters that take forever to die.  I usually don't buff unless I have another healer in the group because it takes too much mana.  I was grouped with 3 rangers once who let me sit on my butt and med while they kicked tail with my buffs on (that is my favorite).  I would say the best group from a shaman's perspective would be you (the shaman), two tanks, a bard, a shaman/druid/cleric, and a wizard/necro/enchanter/magician.  Once you get a group of level 25's, they all know their role pretty well, which makes it a very pleasurable experience.  Another thing to remember is that the 29+ enchanter is a mana users best friend with clarity.

   <P> I hope you have as much fun in Cazic as I have.  XP and loot are both average to above average in this dungeon.  The good thing is that it's hard to get both good xp and good loot off of one monster with such regularity.  If CT has more than 20 people in it, be prepared for trains.  Good luck and have fun!

<P>     Best wishes, Gunkbut Chikmagnit of Chaos Nation
