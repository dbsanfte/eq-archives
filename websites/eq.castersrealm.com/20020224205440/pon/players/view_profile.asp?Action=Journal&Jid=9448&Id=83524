  <tr><td ><p>My beginning in the Art of Necromancy was very interesting indeed.  Tasks were required of me to complete to prove myself, and I took this duty very seriously indeed.</p>

<p>I asked Master Xydoz, in the Tower of Death, how I could prove myself to him. He wanted me to bring him the brains of four Sarnak Hatchlings.  I went into Lake of Ill Omen and did battle with the Sarnak Hatchlings and was able to rummage through the remains of their corpses and collect four brains in excellent condition.  I then returned it to Master Xydoz and he gave me a reward of an Apprentice Skullcap that I wore with pride.  This seemed to be the beginning of my quests to show my loyalty.</p>

<p>After completing the first task Master Xydoz stated to me that he seeks a faded tapestry. I had to hone my skills in tailoring and acquire two pieces of the now destroyed tapestry and repair them.  Again I was off to do battle with the Sarnak Hatchlings in Lake of Ill Omen.  It took numerous kills of the foul creatures before I found the pieces of the destroyed tapestry among their decaying bodies. They were in a state of illegibility and I needed to use my newly learned tailoring skills to make them whole again.  After I had mended the tapestry I took it back to Master Xydoz. He requested the mended tapestry from me, and my Apprentice Skullcap which I wore so proudly.  But to my excitement, he in turn awarded me the Apprentice Skullcap – 2nd Rank for giving him these items.</p>

<p>Master Xydoz sent me to talk with Master Rixiz next. Master Rixiz handed me a glass canopic and asked me to place inside of it a preserved brain of a Sarnak Crypt Raider. I went out to Lake of Ill Omen and hunted down this Sarnak Crypt Raider.  After a long and arduous battle I was able to vanquish him and them went to work on removing his skullcap and prying out his brain. I knew that this brain would not last long without further embalming procedures to help preserve it.  This lead to me increasing my knowledge in the trade skills.  But the ingredients were not readily available in Cabilis for me.  I had to hunt down the raw materials myself.  First item I needed to get my hands on was a pile of granite pebbles.  The Toilmaster in Cabilis said he would supply me with this if I brought him two Froglok Slave Shackles from his escaped Froglok Slaves. Word around town was that the slaves had run out into the Swamp of No Hope.  So this is where my adventure started.  I hunted there for many hours looking for these elusive slaves.  But in the end my will was stronger and I returned to Cabilis with the shackles he requested.  He gave me a pile of granite pebbles that I needed, but still I needed to turn these in a more fine bone granite powder. I went to the town forge and combined this pile of pebbles with two bone chips that I acquired earlier in Field of Bone, plus I used my Forging Hammer that I had purchased in town. This produced the bone granite powder I needed. But still I did not have the raw materials I needed to make the embalming fluid. So now I had the bone granite powder and went in search of a few more raw materials to complete my concoction.  I went out to Field of Bone and found a vendor selling snake scales, an important component in the making of Bog Juice.  But I still needed to find some rubbing alcohol.  And to my good fortune I found another vendor deep in Cabilis that had a limited quantity of this item.  I quickly bought some, and returned to the town brewing barrel.  Here I combined the bone granite powder, two bog juices, and the rubbing alcohol to create a crude embalming fluid.  Once I added it to the brain in the glass canopic I was ready to return my work to Master Rixiz. Once I returned to Master Rixiz, I handed him the glass canopic, and he was pleased with my work.  He also requested that I turn my Apprentice Skullcap – 2nd Rank to him as well.  In return I received the more prestigious Apprentice Skullcap – 3rd Rank.  I knew I was really showing them that I was serious about my art and I wanted even tougher tasks to complete.</p>

<p>Master Rixiz sent me to talk with Master Kyvix next. I asked if he needed the services of an Apprentice of the Third Circle, and if he had any tasks for me to complete. He handed me a Brood Sac, which he wanted filled with creeper cabbage, a heartsting telson with venom, brutling choppers and a scalebone femur.  I knew this was a much more strenuous task, but I was up to completing it. This journey took a bit longer than the previous tasks I had received and sent me to a few more places to hunt for these items.  First item I was able to acquire was the heartsting telson with venom.  There is a pit in Field of Bone that is home to many large and dangerous creatures, one of which is the Heartsting Scorpion.  Although these creatures are much larger than myself, I was able to use my dark powers to quickly exterminate his life force.  I took my dagger and cut the telson away from his carcass.  I was in luck, the poison was still in tack, so I quickly put it into the Brood Sac. On my way out of the pit I was jumped by a Greater Scalebone Skeleton.  This battle did not fair as well for me.  He quickly vanquished my skeleton pet, and went to work on making me a corpse as well.  But a brave shaman named Kanian came to my aid and assisted me in killing him.  This led to me acquiring the scalebone femur.  I had completed two parts of the task already, but I knew the rest would be more time consuming since I did not know where to find the other two items.  My search of the surrounding areas took me back into the Swamp of No Hope.  I saw numerous kinds of creatures, and did battle on a number of occasions.  Luckily a creature caught my eye, it was called a Man Eating Creeper.  For some reason I knew that he would have one of the items I was in need of.  My skeleton pet went to work quickly and took the battle to this plant creature.  My fingers sparked with magical energy in the darkness and in the end again I had come out victorious.  Rummaging through the plant creatures body I found the creeper cabbage. Only one task remained now.  Many days passed as I scoured the surrounding countryside looking for a Skulking Brutling.  I had heard this is the creature to get the Brutling Choppers from. My adventure took me out to Warsilks Woods and deep into the forest.  Due to my experience that I had attained by so many battles previous, I was able to fight my way deep into the forest without any real harm to myself or my pet skeleton.  With some luck I was able to corner a Skulking Brutling without much effort, but trying to keep my skeleton blows away from the facial area was a bit of a task, for a did not want to damage his choppers or they would be useless to me. But again my proven battle skills won over the dumb creature ferociousness and I was able to surgically remove his lower jaw and place it into the Brood Sac with the other items.  I returned to Master Kyvix with the four items in the Brood Sac and he requested that I hand over my Apprentice Skullcap – 3rd Rank. He was very pleased with the speed in which I collected these items, and the excellent condition that I had kept them in.  He handed me the Dark Binder Skullcap as a reward.  But unlike the other Skullcaps I had received, this one seemed a bit different.  It had a glow about it, and I knew the dark gods were smiling upon me and had granted this item some magical powers that I would now get to share in.</p>

<p>After getting my Dark Binder Skullcap, Master Kyvix said something about a 'true mission' to me. He said “I have been waiting for a Nihilist to return. His name was Ryx and I fear his love of ale and the high seas has kept him from his mission. All I want you to do is find him. He should be disguised as a worker and he will give you a tome to bring to me. Return it with your Dark Binder Skullcap. I am sure that is simple enough for one as simple as you. Be sure to give him this.” Then he gave me a spectacle.  My search for Ryx took into Overthere, and the Dark Outpost. Many hours passed as I looked for him, and to my surprise me was disguised as a skeleton worker, and he was on top of one of the boats that are on dry dock being built.  My master had given me a spectacle when I accepted the task, so I in turn gave it to Ryx.  He then said “I live to study and quench my thirst. I live to Bash the Faces of Pariah and entangle myself in the ivy of evergreen. I live. I want to remember"  He then requested I seek out for him four items, a forsaken pariah mask, an evergreen ivy ringband, the spectacle, and a bottle of Green Death Rum. Since Master Kyvix had already given me the spectacle, only three things were needed to be found. On my way back from Overthere I went through the dark Warsilks Woods and came across a massive fort filled with Giants. I made myself invisible and ventured inside. I found a group of adventurers in there slaughtering the giants. And I asked them if they had seem an evergreen ivy ringguard, and to my surprise not only had they seem one, but they gave it to me.  I thanked them for their help and waved farewell.  In my previous journeys I had seen Iksar Pariahs in the Lake of Ill Omen, so I headed there right away. I came across a musical type soft skin named Izun and I noticed he was doing battle with the creature that I was hunting.  I quickly joined into the battle and together we made short work of the Iksar Pariah.  He thanked me for my help and allowed me to check the corpse for the item I was in search of.  And low and behold, I had the forsaken pariah mask. In a great celebrating mood, I headed back to Cabilis knowing I was only one item away from completing my task. So I went to the Tink & Babble Tavern to celebrate and quench my thirst. After many drinks I struck up a conversation with the bartender.  We talked about the many adventures he had been on, and I told him of some of my adventures. Many hours later, when we were both quite liquored up he brought out a special stash he kept under the bar for special occasions. With the luck I had been having today you know it could of only been the green death run he pulled out. I quickly struck up a deal with him to take the bottle with me. It cost me a bit, but I knew that it would be worth it in the end. So I headed back to the Dark Outpost.  I gave the 4 items to Ryx and he in turn gave me metal key and instructed me to go see the banker. I took the metal key to the bank in the Dark Outpost and gave it to one of the Tin Bankers and in return he gave me a tome and some money. I knew this was the item Master Kyvix was looking for, and I returned home post haste. I gave him the Tome and my prized Dark Binder Skullcap. My hopes of getting something even more powerful was realized, I got another magical skullcap called the Occultist Skullcap, as well it seemed to be even more powerful than its predecessor.</p>
