<hr size='1' width='85%'>

<table border='0' width='85%' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'>
  <tr>
    <td width='100%'><small><font face='Arial'><b>Introduction</b></font></small><p><small><font
    face='Arial'>The Enchanter is probably one of the least well understood classes in
    EverQuest. While it is rare to find players who can master their classes well, finding a
    good enchanter can be terribly difficult, because a poorly played enchanter is so
    memorable to others as to discolor the entire notion of the value of the class. Anyone,
    who has experienced a bad enchanter, especially if the bad enchanter was the first
    experience with an enchanter, would find it difficult to believe that enchanters can
    contribute to a party.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>But, as any high-level player will tell you, enchanters rock.
    A well-played enchanter contributes more to a party than any other class possibly could.
    If you seek to follow the path of the enchanter, you must learn to work with the powers
    you earn. You are not a wizard, and you will never be a wizard, so get over the idea of
    blasting your enemies with potent, offensive spells of massive damage. You will never be
    able to best a wizard in raw spell damage. Never. In fact, among all pure spellcasters,
    enchanters are directly responsible for the least amount of damage of any caster --
    including clerics, shamans, and druids. But enchanters are seldom direct; the power of an
    enchanter is the ability to manipulate the elements of his environment to bring about an
    outcome favorable to the enchanter. But the price of this awesome power is simply this:
    the enchanter requires elements in the environment to manipulate in order to triumph! An
    enchanter in a vacuum is equal to a vacuum.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Fortunately, enemies present themselves as elements of the
    environment to manipulate. An enchanter might not be able to handle a single attacker
    effectively, but watch him easily dispatch two or three without breaking a sweat! That is
    what it means to be an enchanter. An enchanter manipulates -- abilities, circumstances,
    minds -- and the results can be amazing.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>But when an enchanter makes a mistake, the enchanter will
    likely be the first (of many) to die -- which, if you consider it for a moment, is only
    fair. Unfortunately, the mistakes of others can cost an enchanter dearly, too. But part of
    being an enchanter is learning how to minimize these situations, and that education comes
    with the experience of growing up following this path.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Creating an Enchanter</b> </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>When you first seek to create an enchanter, you will need to
    select a race and some statistical adjustment. Many enchanters have somewhat differing
    opinions on which is best, but that just demonstrates personal preference is the deciding
    factor here. As you grow up, the primary statistics for an enchanter are clearly charisma
    and intelligence, but be advised that these statistics can easily be increased with items
    and spells. Getting both stats to 200 should be an ever-present goal for an aspiring
    enchanter.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>As to how to start, I recommend putting at least half of your
    available discretionary points into charisma. Charisma is so vital for an enchanter that
    you cannot start out with too much of it. Many of the spells upon which an enchanter
    depends are influenced by the charisma of the caster. With a sufficiently high charisma,
    the enchanter will prevail most of the time. An uncharismatic enchanter is a poor wizard
    -- and a poor enchanter.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>There is an alternate viewpoint on this subject, and that is
    that stats should be put into elements that the enchanter isn't likely to be able to
    advance much in the game -- such as strength and agility. Because charisma and
    intelligence are so easily modified with items and spells, it makes sense. You will not
    find lots of items for spellcasters which improve your other stats, but there are lots of
    items for enchanters for improving intelligence and charisma. Unless you are playing a
    twinked enchanter, however, you won't have access to them for many, many levels. Beyond
    that, an enchanter has two primary statistics, not just one. Wizards can often easily get
    their INT to 200, but an enchanter with an INT of 200 has probably sacrificed some of his
    potential charisma to get it there. With a higher charisma, the enchanter would have fewer
    resists on many important spells and would therefore spend less mana.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Being a dark elf nets an enchanter certain advantages,
    including ultravision, and easy access to the metal enchantment spells. Gnomes are
    marginally tolerated in Neriak, however, so Illusion:Gnome is just fine for sneaking into
    Neriak. Gnomes can tinker, which gives gnomish enchanters an extra skill (besides
    jewelcraft) to master. High elves have a (relatively) high base charisma already, which
    would arguably make them better than other races for enchanters, but keep in mind that
    charisma is the easiest of all statistics to enhance with magical items and especially
    magical jewelry. In general, I recommend selecting a race that is appealing to you.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>What I do not recommend, however, is selecting a deity to
    worship. An enchanter is far more capable of succeeding in Norrath as an agnostic than
    with a deity selected -- NPC's can smell religious faction from far beyond your clipping
    plane, which will make illusion spells worthless in many circumstances. If you do select a
    religion for your enchanter, know that you will lessen your own ability in doing so. You
    cannot sneak into Neriak using any illusion at all, if you worship certain deities.
    Invisibility and a lot of luck will be your only means into that city. If you have an RP
    reason to select a deity, then do so. Otherwise, opt for agnostic. You'll appreciate the
    flexibility it gives you later.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Once the enchanter is created and in the game, it is
    important to spend the five available practice points on various skills. Piercing is
    probably a good choice to start; alteration, abjuration, channeling, and conjuration are
    probably the best remaning choices. You could substitute divination for conjuration. Do
    not put any points into trade skills (i.e. jewelcraft) or any languages at this time.
    Also, do not put any points into Evocation just yet. Once you hit 2nd level, put a point
    or two into each of the other weapon skills you can, and always make sure that you
    practice them at each level, so that you have the flexibility to choose what kind of
    weapon you use as you find new magical weapons.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>The Low-Level Enchanter</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>At low levels, all spellcasters are generally out to do the
    same thing -- level quickly. At lower levels, all spellcasters generally operate as poor
    to marginal melee types with some offensive spell capability. This is especially true for
    the first four or five levels. There really is no other way to play.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>At fourth level, however, an enchanter gets the first spell
    which helps define his class -- Mesmerize. It is quite likely that a low-level enchanter
    will neglect the use of this spell, and it's little wonder that he would -- after all,
    it's damage that counts. Only by killing creatures, or helping to kill creatures, can an
    enchanter hope to increase his power and ability. And it's still the way of the wizard or
    the way of the mage which makes this possible.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The low-level enchanter may or may not use a pet. Ideally, at
    fourth level, the enchanter should begin to use Juli's Animation, as the animation is a
    vital protective mechanism for an enchanter at lower levels. The enchanter is terribly
    weak at these lower levels, and the extra damage and damage absorption that an animation
    can provide is great for saving the enchanter's life. But know that the use of pets tends
    to drop off at higher levels. The tactics that the enchanter learns with pets at this
    stage will not likely be used much, if at all, at higher levels.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Be aware that an enchanter's pet is uncommandable. It only
    responds to attacks on the enchanter or the pet, and it never backs off. Because of this,
    it quite often interferes with an enchanter's first efforts at learning to use Mesmerize,
    which only slows down the growth of the enchanter. This is not, however, much of an
    impediment to play, as the enchanter is not expected to have mastered Mesmerize yet, and,
    in all likelihood, none of the players he would or could group with would understand how
    to work with Mesmerize, anyway.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Beyond that, Mesmerize and its more powerful versions all
    depend heavily on the charisma of the enchanter, which is quite probably still low. For
    best effect, the enchanter's charisma should be in excess of 170 points.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Mesmerize, in case it is not clear, is a spell which, when
    not resisted, stuns a target for fifteen seconds, provided the target takes no physical
    damage during that time (i.e. loss of hit points). At low levels, where many players solo,
    and grouping is not unlike the tenative first dating steps that teenagers make, the
    usefulness of Mesmerize will not become apparent. It is, however, a fantastic defensive
    spell -- in the event that the pet is dead, and the enchanter is low on HP and mana, a
    quick Mesmerize will let the enchanter escape. It is a great emergency escape spell.
    Mesmerize also may or may not (depending on which theory of the week is being promoted)
    wipe a creature's hate list, meaning that it may completely forget about the enchanter if
    the enchanter gets far enough away before the spell wears off.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>At lower levels, another great spell for an enchanter is
    Color Flux. This spell is an area effect stun spell, which stuns enemies around the caster
    (but not the caster himself). The duration of this spell is initially maybe two or three
    seconds, but it's usually long enough to get another spell cast. Just make sure that you
    never use this spell near a guard, or any creature which is not normally aggressive to
    you, as, even resisted, this spell will turn an indifferent creature into a hostile one
    very quickly. Unlike Mesmerize, Color Flux and its line of spells is not broken by damage.
    Eventually, this spell will increase in duration up to around six seconds.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Remember that, until 8th level, the spells that you have for
    damage are actually damage-over-time (DoT) spells. That means that, by repeatedly casting
    these spells, the damage over time component never gets to complete, which makes the
    spells less mana efficient (meaning that you spend more time meditating). However, you
    usually will not be able to afford to wait for the spell's damage to finish kicking in, so
    this simply makes the enchanter more mana inefficient at lower levels.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Another 4th level class-defining spell is Tashan. Tashan is a
    spell which lowers the magic resistance of the target. Enchanters only use magical magic.
    Enchanters do not use elemental-, poison-, or disease-type magics, and largely have no
    defenses against them. But in the realm of magic alone, the enchanter reigns supreme, and
    his spells for influencing magic are greater than any other's. Tashan will likely be the
    opening spell cast by any enchanter on a target, since it means much greater likelihood of
    success when casting other spells. Fewer resists means less mana spent, which is always a
    good thing. This spell is also handy for other casting classes, as it means that their
    magical-based attacks and spells will have a much greater chance of succeeding.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>At 8th level, an enchanter gets his first direct damage spell
    -- Chaotic Feedback. This spell starts at 43 points of damage, and grows to 48 points of
    damage maximum at 13th level. It has a long recast delay (all enchaters' direct damage
    spells suffer from this), so an enchanter will still be unable to dish out damage like a
    wizard (even though a wizard at this level hardly rivals an enchanter in terms of damage
    per cast). The problem with this spell, however, is that it is the first one to use the
    skill of Evocation, so the first thing an 8th level enchanter must do is go put some
    training points into Evocation. Either put twenty points into it, or be prepared to go
    practice casting this spell on a corpse until skill improves to more than twenty. It is
    beyond frustrating to attempt to use this spell and have it fizzle eight times in a row
    because the enchanter does not know how to use evocative magic.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>At 8th level, an enchanter also gets a pet that is capable of
    hitting magic creatures. At this level, the wisp becomes a potential candidate for
    hunting, and the cash which can be made at this level by simply hunting wisps and selling
    the light stones and greater light stones to NPC's (and many PC's will now buy greater
    lightstones for seven platinum) is truly amazing, compared to the copper that the
    enchanter has been scraping to collect until now. Be sure to always cast Reclaim Energy on
    any pet which isn't the most capable pet you can summon (at level 8, you should be able to
    summon a pet that is 9th level, and therefore appears yellow when you consider it). Cast
    Tashan on the wisp, back off when the pet starts attacking the wisp, and throw your 4th
    level DoT on the wisp. Then watch the health of your pet and the wisp. If the pet reaches
    50% health, start blasting the wisp to draw it onto you. If you have a magic weapon (get a
    magician to summon a dagger for you, if needed), melee the wisp, too. If not, be ready to
    use up all your mana blasting the wisp.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Whatever you do, do not let the wisp kill your pet. Get used
    to the idea of getting hit a lot -- it will happen. You have to be willing to lose a large
    percentage of your hit points when soloing. It beats dying. Learn to balance the damage
    that your pet takes and the damage that you take. Your pet heals a lot faster than you do,
    however, so if you are soloing, let the pet take more damage. Just don't let it die -- or
    your chances of dying dramatically increase.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>One tactic that you can always use is to summon a new pet
    once your pet is slain. This means keeping your pet summoning spell memorized -- or, at
    least, keeping Mesmerize handy and using that to keep your enemy occupied while you
    re-memorize the pet spell and then cast it.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>At 12th level, an enchanter gets a new DoT, and a new pet,
    and has by this time become a wisp hunting machine, no doubt. But the enchanter also gets
    a taste of another defining spell -- Charm. Charm is one spell which can turn defeat into
    victory. Charm turns an NPC into a commandable pet. And, because NPC's are much stronger
    than PC's, the higher their levels are, the more power an enchanter gains when using this
    spell (and its higher-level versions). Charm has two very large drawbacks, however. One is
    that the spell, when resisted or broken, causes the formerly charmed creature to hate the
    enchanter with a passion. The other is that it depends on charisma like no other spell,
    and an enchanter with an average charisma (in the 80-110 range) will find that the spell
    behaves in a manner that is most euphemistically described as &quot;worthless&quot;. At
    lower levels, you may practice using this spell, but only with an understanding party. You
    will rarely use this spell when soloing at this stage.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The charisma of the caster of Charm and Mesmerize and
    Stun-type spells affects the resistibility of these spells. A creature continues to try to
    break charm as long as the charm effect is in place, and casters with a low charisma will
    find that the charm spell lasts a very short amount of time, if at all, because NPC's get
    to attempt to resist the spell every few seconds. With a low charisma, the spell gets
    resisted rather quickly. With a very high charisma (160+), the spell is resisted much
    less, and it is much less likely to wear off at any given opportunity. So, when using any
    such spells, a high charisma is vital.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Because the low-level enchanter rarely has the charisma
    needed to really use these spells effectively, the low-level enchanter is doomed to
    frustration when trying to use the spells which define his class. Thus, many enchanters
    behave as poor mages, with poor ability to blast, and with poor, braindead pets.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Other 12th level spells include an attack slowing spell
    (Languid Pace) and a random-duration stun spell (Whirl till You Hurl) and a hate list
    remover (Memory Blur). Languid Pace is one of the better debuffing spells that an
    enchanter will get. While there are many strength debuffing spells, and the DoT's also
    debuff STR and AC, the effect of debuffing a creature's strength (there are three
    different lines of spells for this) is less than the effect of slowing his attack speed.
    Additionally, fights don't often last long enough for a third STR debuff spell to make
    much of a difference at all. (Cast DoT [with STR and AC debuff], then cast another STR
    debuff, then try casting another... creature is usually near death by now... Cast Languid
    Pace as first spell, and reduce the damage taken from the creature by 35% or so...)</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Whirl till You Hurl is a curious spell. Some enchanters hail
    it as a great addition to their arsenal, and others complain that it is too unreliable to
    use. You'll have to test it and decide for yourself, but I found other, better ways to do
    what that spell used to allow. (It was nerfed beyond all recognition many moons ago.)</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Memory Blur is another trademark spell. Memory Blur wipes the
    hate list of creatures below 30th level, and then has a chance of doing so for creatures
    higher than 30th level (less likely the higher the level). (The hate list is the list of
    creatures that an NPC hates at the moment, based largely on the amount of damage a
    creature has done to the NPC, but some spell effects, such as charm, can move the
    enchanter to the top of the hate list.) Any creature below 30th level cannot resist this
    spell. While wiping the hate list is not sufficient to get a creature to leave the
    enchanter alone, it can be enough to stop a creature from frenzying on a well-beaten tank
    who is trying to back off unsuccessfully, and it can be used to great effect to calm down
    a creature that you've attacked but which is normally not aggressive.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>The Young Enchanter</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>At level 16, the enchanter gets a new direct damage spell, a
    new pet, and some rather interesting spells. The second spell of the Mesmerize line,
    Enthrall, becomes available. Enthrall is like a double-mesmerize, lasting thirty seconds
    instead of fifteen. Also available via research is the spell Mesmerization. Mesmerization
    is an area effect mesmerize spell. It affects the target and all potential enemies within
    a radius of effect around the target, which can include the caster. This spell is the
    great train smasher, the one which can turn a nightmarish hell of massive death into an
    orderly procession of slain foes. But, at level 16, it suffers from two nasty problems.
    One is that, if the enchanter's charisma is not high (at level 16, it is probably quite
    low), then the creatures affected by the spell will resist often -- and be very interested
    in seeing a dead enchanter. The other is that it is a matter of professional pride never
    to mesmerize one's self. Once an enchanter starts using this spell, an enchanter will
    mesmerize himself on occasion. It's embarassing.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>One thing an enchanter might notice at this stage is that
    different versions of the various mesmerization spells will not overwrite one another. If
    a target is mesmerized, he cannot be enthralled. If a target was mesmerized with
    Mesmerization, he cannot be re-mesmerized with Mesmerize. Consequently, using these spells
    together takes some organization. Generally, Mesmerization and only one Mesmerize-type
    spell would be memorized at any one time. At 16th level, the enchanter probably is not
    skilled enough to prevent distractions from interrupting his spells, so Mesmerize, with
    its much faster casting time, is still a better choice than Enthrall.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Another thing a young enchanter will discover is that Charm
    fails to work on creatures higher than 18th level. It will not be until 24th level that
    the enchanter gets another Charm spell (Beguile) which will work on higher-level
    creatures. On the other hand, there are usually lower level (under 18th level) creatures
    around yet, who still make good pets, and still outdamage everyone else in the party.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>From this point on, the enchanter starts to come into his own
    as a valued addition to a party. Tanks will begin to clamour for Quickness, and the
    enchanter will begin to see how his ability to do indirect damage really starts to make a
    difference to a party. Before now, the enchanter had some serious ability (if
    underdeveloped) to reduce the amount of damage done to a party. Now, he has some serious
    ability to increase the amount of damage that a party does.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In fact, at this level, because of Quickness, an enchanter
    has the ability to add value to parties consisting of members much higher than his level.
    Because of Tashan, an enchanter can join a party of higher-level spellcasters and
    contribute to the success of the magical attack and effects that higher-level spellcasters
    are trying to employ.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>At 24th level, an enchanter with Alacrity (Quickness II) can
    easily join a group of 30th+ level tanks and be a valued addition. And Memory Blur can be
    used to great advantage in such parties.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Part of being a young enchanter is learning to use your
    skills. However, you will find that you have no idea what your skills are until you reach
    20th level or so, and even then, knowing what they are is not the same as knowing how to
    use them. It will take time.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>However, rather than continuing with a discussion of
    enchanters at each stage of his life, I want to discuss effective tactics. Some of these
    transcend mundane considerations such as character level.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Crowd Control</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The act of mesmerizing creatures is probably the birth of a
    real enchanter. The beginnings of awareness of the utility of this type of spell indicate
    the turn away from the common magicks into the realm of enchantment.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The mesmerization spells turn a train into an orderly
    progression of slain foes. That is what this line is really for. NPC's become far, far too
    powerful as time goes on. Groups are used to defeat these enemies, but when the odds are
    six on six, six ultra-powerful NPC's versus six mediocre players, it becomes time to
    change the rules in order to win the game. The enchanter, with Mesmerize, is the key to
    changing those rules.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>An enchanter seeks to put creatures under his control by
    mesmerizing them, and keeping them mesmerized, while the party works on defeating one
    enemy at a time. An enchanter who does this effectively changes a single six-on-six fight
    into six five-on-one fights, while the other creatures stand their drooling, waiting their
    turns. The ability to do this, and do this well, can mean the difference between life and
    death for an enchanter's party.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>But this does have a price. An undisciplined party, an
    untrained party, will likely attack whatever foe happens to be standing near -- including
    mesmerized targets. Damage wakes up a mesmerized target, and, especially at higher levels,
    the creature is going to remember who mesmerized him, and will likely be quite angry with
    the enchanter for doing so -- more angry, in fact, than a few blows from a sword will make
    him. A party that does not know that it should only attack one creature at a time, and let
    the enchanter or the puller call which target to go after next, or a party with members
    who simply refuse to cooperate, will only get the enchanter killed very often.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>It can take considerable effort to train a party to use the
    enchanter effectively. Fortunately, as levels go higher, people generally realize that
    there are better ways to do things, and following the enchanter's lead becomes an accepted
    way of life. It may require many deaths, and it always requires a lot of patience.
    Unfortunately, in one of life's little ironies, the people most suited to being enchanters
    are least likely to be patient.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>If you can be patient, you can win. If you can get a single
    party that you always adventure with, and you learn to understand each other, and operate
    as a team, not as a group of players acting individually and sharing XP, then all of
    EverQuest will open to you and your party, and you'll be able to take on odds that boggle
    the minds of ordinary players. The next best thing is to make sure that everyone you group
    with is educated on the ways of the enchanter, and learns to work with you instead of
    against you.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The key to mastering the mesmerization spells is being able
    to accurately predict when something is going to wake up and get it mesmerized again
    before that happens. Remember -- you can reapply the same spell to a mesmerized foe. If
    you use Enthrall, you can enthrall all your foes and keep round-robin enthralling them
    while your party takes out a single target.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>You can also use Mesmerization when there are a large number
    of foes to be addressed at once. But be careful with this one. You will mesmerize yourself
    on occasion, especially if you are near the targets that you cast on. Ideally, if your
    puller grabs a whole train of creatures, repeatedly casting Mesmerization every 10 seconds
    on your puller (assuming you're on a carebear server) will generally keep everything
    nicely mesmerized until the party deals with each one individually -- but you need to run
    back, away from your puller, not to get yourself caught in the area of effect. Target your
    puller, run away a bit, and cast. If anything resists and comes for you, enthrall it.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Timing is everything with these spells. Learn to use the tick
    of your mana bar (see tactics on mana management, later in this guide) to time the
    duration of the spells (or use a wrist watch, for real accuracy). Realize that you would
    have to cast Mesmerize constantly if you have to keep three creatures at bay -- round
    robin among the three creatures. Realize that you will get a resist every now and then,
    and plan for that resist as part of your casting. Switch to Enthrall or Entrance at higher
    levels, because you'll never get a chance to rest if you don't -- trying to keep three or
    more targets mesmerized requires the use of higher-level spells, because it is simply
    impossible to cast Mesmerize fast enough to keep any more than three creatures mesmerized,
    assuming no resists.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>It takes practice. If you want to master enchantment, you
    have to test it, have to push it, to see exactly how far you can go with your spells. Your
    first test should be seeing how long you can keep a single enemy mesmerized. Until you are
    certain that you can keep a single creature mesmerized indefinitely, you need more
    practice. From there, you work on keeping two creatures mesmerized indefinitely. Use
    Enthrall. Use Mesmerization. Once you can keep two creatures mesmerized indefinitely,
    three or more becomes easy to do.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>To improve the usefulness of Mesmerization, find ways to
    increase your magic resistance, so that you can cast it at close range and have a
    reasonable chance of resisting it. An enchanter gets Endure Magic, Resist Magic, and Group
    Resist Magic -- the enchanter should always have the strongest one of these buffs up that
    he can. (Group Resist Magic is about 15 points stronger than Resist Magic, so at 49th
    level, you should always cast Group Resist Magic on yourself, even if the group size is
    one!) Likewise, look for items which increase magic resistance. There are several good
    ones out there.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Once your magic resistance exceeds 100, it will be quite
    difficult to mesmerize yourself -- although it still isn't impossible! Fortunately, there
    are two things to note about Mesmerization. One is that it will usually wear off the
    caster a couple seconds before it wears off the enemies, meaning that a quick enchanter
    will have an opportunity to cast a second time before taking any damage from the NPC's.
    The second is that, if a creature does resist and the enchanter mesmerizes himself, he'll
    probably get hit in the next second and thus be broken from the mesmerization, anyway.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Be aware that any damage will break any mesmerization effect.
    This includes area effect spells, area effect weaponry, and DoT's. It is vital that any
    enchanter who is doing crowd control not be hampered by players who insist on using these
    items near, near, or on (respectively) any mesmerized creatures. In particular, area
    effect damage spells will rarely, if ever, act as more of a taunt than a remembered
    Enthrall. Similarly, a DoT on a creature you're trying to crowd control will only be a
    persistently re-awakened foe, who hates you, the enchanter, a lot more than whoever cast
    the DoT.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Your best friend, as a crowd control expert, is a healer who
    is watching your back constantly. Your worst enemy is someone else who wants to help you
    with crowd control. As an enchanter, crowd control is your job. No one else has any
    business even attempting to do so while you are around. A bard's mind control songs (bards
    can mesmerize and charm, too) do not stack with the enchanter's various spells. Nor can
    they overwrite one another. If you have a bard around casting his sleep song, he just
    prevented you from doing what you do best, and he should be singing his mana regen song
    (at level 32+), anyway.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>But even worse than this is someone who tries to help you by
    trying to taunt something off you. This is the bane of enchanters everywhere. A friendly
    wizard, not doing anything else at the moment, decides to help you by taunting something
    off you which is already quite furious with you for having attempted to mesmerize it. You
    manage to cast Enthrall, and the well-meaning wizard then hits the creature with his
    dagger for four points of damage.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>There is no way that anyone, even a paladin with a Fiery
    Avenger, has a snowball's chance in Lavastorm of taunting a creature off of you with melee
    damage alone. You must educate your party members in the proper ways to help an enchanter
    when something is on him. These are:</font></small><ol>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>KILL THE CREATURE. If the would-be assistant cannot kill
        whatever is frenzied on you, the enchanter, in a single round, then there is no point in
        attempting to melee it or cast damage spells on it. Ice Comet might not be enough pure
        damage to taunt a creature off an enchanter, but if the creature can be killed with a cast
        of Ice Comet, then cast, wizard, cast!</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>HEAL THE ENCHANTER. Healing the enchanter is the best taunt
        possible. Even though it probably won't taunt the creature off the enchanter, it will buy
        the enchanter some more time to get the creature under the enchanter's control.</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>TAUNT THE CREATURE WITH NON-DAMAGING SPELLS. Root, Snare,
        Engulfing Darkness, various stuns, Blindness, Malaise, Drowsy, whatever -- these spells
        are all effective taunts, and will generally give the enchanter a little breathing room to
        get the creature back under control. If the enemy is rooted, the enchanter can at least
        back away. Great wizards will use root spells a lot like mesmerize, against melee-type
        enemies, anyway. If you find a wizard who can do this well, keep him.</font></small></li>
    </ol>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Any other course of action by a would-be helper will only get
    the enchanter killed. In particular, attempting to damage the creature to taunt it away
    from the enchanter will only get the enchanter killed, since the common sequence of events
    is: enchanter mesmerizes creature, assistant damages creature, creature hits enchanter,
    enchanter scrambles to mesmerize the creature again (usually while screaming at the
    assistant), assistant damages creature, etc., etc., etc.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>It is important that most party members are acting against
    the primary target that was called by the enchanter or the puller. Getting everyone to do
    this will usually obviate any panicked scrambling to get a creature mesmerized again after
    a helper &quot;helps&quot; you with it, since the helper will instead be working on the
    primary target, which most assuredly is not interested in the enchanter.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In order to do crowd control effectively, there are a couple
    of additional skills which are required. The first is being able to target your target
    with your mouse quickly and efficiently. This takes practice. You have to learn to be able
    to find the precisely right pixel to target precisely the right creature from among your
    party and the several NPC's that are all in your field of view. You have to be willing to
    run around to be able to target, or to switch you view so that you can target. It is not
    hard, but it does take practice!</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>You also need to realize that your job is to know everything
    that is going on with your party and your enemies at any time. You need to watch the
    health bars of your party members -- it's not just the cleric's job. This will tell you
    where trouble areas are -- maybe you messed up and didn't mesmerize something! You also
    need to watch the text display. If you are using Color Shift, you will get messages about
    the effect of the spell on every nearby creature. If you think you're dealing with four
    creatures, but you get six messages back when you cast Color Shift, then clearly you have
    two new arrivals that you now have to deal with.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>If you ever see a new &quot;a Solusek kobold says,
    'Half-elves like you are better left dead!'&quot;, know that you probably have a new spawn
    that needs your tender guidance immediately. Watch and see who is casting spells, and who
    is doing damage. The sudden appearance of &quot;a lava duct crawler bites SheBob for 90
    points of damage!&quot; when you are nowhere near lava duct crawlers probably means that
    you have a new train to deal with. Stay alert. Be active.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Crowd Control does have its limitations. There are some
    creatures who are immune to crowd control (and usually any form of stunning). These
    include Ice Giants, Fire Giants, and Dragons. There are also magically immune creatures,
    occasionally within Norrath, but most certainly on the various planes, who will be
    completely resistant to anything you throw at it, but will nevertheless perceive you as a
    threat worse than any other. In these cases, crowd control is extremely difficult -- if
    possible at all. Perhaps you can add a chapter of your own here.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In summary, you have to be aware, and you have to control the
    fight. There is no skill that an enchanter needs to master more than this one. This is
    Crowd Control 101 through Crowd Control 499. If you can learn to do this well, then you
    are a professional enchanter. Everything else that an enchanter adds is just icing on the
    cake.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Color Series</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The Color Series will likely find a permanent spot on the
    memorized spell list of every enchanter. Color Flux, the first spell, is an area-effect,
    point-blank stun effect, centered on (but not affecting) the enchanter. It allegedly
    depends on the charisma of the caster for its resistibility, and my experience suggests
    that this is true.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The primary difference between the spells in this series is
    the area of effect. The duration of the spells improves with the level of the enchanter,
    and, in fact, is the same for all three spells, at any given level. The difference is area
    of effect. Color Flux, 4th level, is practically skin tight. Color Shift, 20th level, has
    a larger radius of effect. Color Skew, 44th level, will generally cover an entire room.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Usually, and especially at lower levels, this spell is used
    to give the enchanter some breathing room to cast another spell. Color Flux casts
    amazingly quickly. Initially, merely casting the spell will give enough time to cast a
    second spell (assuming that Flux wasn't resisted). More powerful spells generally have
    longer casting times, however, and there will come a time when Flux just doesn't last long
    enough. The solution to this is accurate timing and running away.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The moment the spell takes effect, start backing away from
    the target. There is some delay between the time the spell completes casting, and the time
    that you can cast another spell. During this time, move. The moment you can cast again, do
    so -- and the spell will finish as the creature starts running toward you, rather than
    just before he hits you and interrupts the spell.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The series really shines, however, when two spells (Color
    Flux and Color Shift) are both memorized, and used round-robin to keep creatures stunned
    for more than 90% of their remaining lives. Using all three is also possible. The reason
    that it requires two or three spells where one should suffice? Recast delay. All of these
    spells suffer from a recast delay around twelve to fifteen seconds. Given that the stun
    lasts around six or seven seconds (maximum), it is impossible to cast one spell often
    enough to keep anything stunned for more than 45% of the time. Using two spells, however,
    keeps it stationary for much longer. Using all three would give 100% coverage.
    Fortunately, because the duration of these spells is not different, these spells do
    overwrite one another. They do not, however, affect mesmerization in any way (other than
    to annoy a mesmerized creature inside the area of effect).</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Practice using these spells round-robin once you get Color
    Shift. (It's 20th level, research only.) The damage that you can prevent is phenomenal. I
    tested this tactic against the Steel Golem in the Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule. With a
    38th/39th level ranger, while I was 33rd/34th level, the two of us were able to defeat the
    steel golem by ourselves. I tried it two ways -- one with debuffs, and one without. Both
    left us with 80% health and me with 20% mana. The tactic was this -- Alacrity the ranger,
    Tashan the golem, then Flux and Shift repeatedly. The debuff method had me casting my DoT,
    Tepid Deeds, and two STR debuffs, then Flux/Shift repeatedly. Both ways required 80% of my
    mana for success (or, perhaps, using 80% of my mana meant that we didn't take much
    damage...).</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>I have used this tactic many times in Lower Guk. One time, my
    party (which I didn't know well) had jumped down into the undead area, and had managed to
    get a nasty pull of a wan, a dar, and a third froglok ghoul (shin?). At that time, a dar
    was pretty lethal. I charmed the wan, sicked it on the other froglok, and then cozied up
    to the dar, stunning it repeatedly. To the amazement of everyone, we survived. Compliments
    galore await you when you pull something like this off. But before you start patting
    yourself on the back, remember that all the enchanter does here is make it possible for
    the party to pull off the impossible. Keeping a dar stunned by one's self is a sure route
    to yet another corpse recovery. A bad party here would have had resulted in many deaths.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>This tactic is also useful while waiting for the evacuation
    spell to kick in. When &quot;Evac!&quot; is called, the enchanter should go stand on the
    evacuator and start round-robin casting these spells to get all attention off the druid or
    wizard. You can also use this tactic to buy time for your party, should you feel like
    sacrificing yourself, and you have no means of escape. These stuns taunt quite well, and
    they will get resisted sometimes.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Charm Series</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Charming is something that the enchanter can do better than
    anyone else. While some classes can charm undead, and others can charm animals, nothing is
    immune to a sufficiently powerful enchanter -- except perhaps dragons and deities. Yes, I
    have attempted to charm Nagafen. Attempt is the operative word. I have never successfully
    gotten any spell I cast to stick to Nagafen except the Tashan series (even when standing
    right between his two front legs), so it hardly surprised me that I could not charm
    Nagafen.</font></small></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><small>There are four spells in the charm series: Charm, Beguile,
    Cajoling Whispers, and Allure. Charm only works on creatures up to 18th level. Beguile,
    which comes in at 24th level, works on creatures up to around the low to mid 30's.
    Cajoling Whispers works on creatures up to 45th level, and Allure (49th level)
    up to level 52 (although this is to be increased after expansion). Even at 50th level, you will likely only use Allure if a
    creature that you intend to charm is higher than 45th level (it has a longer recast time
    than Cajoling Whispers). Cajoling Whispers can last several minutes, which is generally
    more than enough time for a pet to assist in dealing with his former allies.</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In order to use charm effectively, you must have a high
    charisma. Anything above 140 is workable; above 170 is useful; 200 is ideal, of course.
    With charm spells, a charmed creature gets to attempt to resist the charm every few
    seconds. Resistance for charm-type spells is determined partially by the charisma of the
    caster. (Level is, I believe, more important.) The higher the charisma of the caster, the
    less likely that the charmed creature will successfully resist the spell each time that he
    attempts to resist it. Once the spell is resisted, it is broken. Each spell also has a
    fixed maximum duration, which increases with the level of the spell, but the maximum
    duration is rarely reached.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Charm is an element of crowd control. But it should never be
    used in place of crowd control. If there are six creatures attacking the party, getting
    five of them mesmerized is the first order of business. Then it is quite easy to charm one
    (even though he won't do anything until he breaks mesmerization). It is usually a good
    idea to send the charmed creature after the same creature that the party is currently
    fighting, rather than sending the charmed creature after one of the other mesmerized
    targets. The reason for this is safety. If charm breaks early, the charmed creature will
    be very angry with the enchanter. If the charmed creature is fighting something that isn't
    mad at someone else, then the charmed creature and his former target will both be all over
    the enchanter -- making it much harder to restore control.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>However, as you get higher in levels, you will find that you
    become quite expert at regaining control, even in the face of opposition. Just remember
    that the random number generator might decide to betray you, and don't be surprised when
    you find two nasty creatures all over you, and you die because none of your tactics for
    regaining control succeeded.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>You should have a hot key for &quot;/pet attack&quot; if you
    use charm much -- which, at higher levels especially, when you have the charisma for it,
    you should do often. No one can do more damage than an enchanter and his charmed pet --
    especially if that pet is a fire giant.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>You can re-charm a creature, but you cannot do so until after
    it has broken the first charm. Make sure you have a high charisma, and the watchful eye of
    a healer on you, and you will always outdamage anyone around you. NPC's always hit much
    harder than PC's of an equivalent level. And any NPC that you are capable of charming is
    guaranteed to be stronger than any pet that you or anyone else your level can summon.
    Which is stronger -- a (49th level) guk knight, or the (40th level) pet of a 49th level
    necromancer?</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>When charm wears off, your former friend will probably (but
    not always) want to thank you properly for messing with his mind. This usually involves
    much damage to the enchanter. Usually, you will find it quite simple to get Enthrall cast
    on a single target, even while it's hitting you for full damage. If your buddy brought
    back friends, use Color Flux to get some breathing room.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>One thing to be aware of is the effect of DoT's on charm.
    Never bother attempting to charm a creature that has had a DoT placed on it, unless that
    DoT has fully worn off. The reason for this is that the creature, once charmed, will still
    be annoyed at whoever put the DoT on him, the moment the DoT does damage. This means that
    the charmed creature will be able to attack the party member that cast the DoT -- even
    though the party member cannot fight back, since the party member cannot attack your pet!
    While this is a handy tactic for getting necromancers and druids killed with experience
    loss, it is not easy to set this up, and getting someone killed three or four times in a
    row with this will probably make him a bit suspicious. Unfortunately, the &quot;/pet back
    off&quot; command only works until the DoT kicks in again.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>One way to get this to work is to make sure that the charmed
    creature does attack something which no one else is fighting. This way, the creature puts
    the charmed creature on its hate list, and then the creature will start hitting the
    charmed creature. As long as something is out-damaging the DoT, then the charmed creature
    won't go after the party member who cast the DoT. But getting this set up takes practice
    to do -- even then, it's still not easy -- and it still runs the risk of having both the
    charmed creature and its former sparring partner coming back to you if the charm wears
    off.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>As always, practice is the key. You'll find, as you improve
    your charisma, that charms become highly valued, highly useful spells.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Debuffing</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>An enchanter is supposed to be a master of debuffing. While
    an enchanter does have a wide variety of debilitating spells at his disposal, experience
    and practice will teach an enchanter that not all debuffs are created equal.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Keep in mind that EverQuest is really two games in one. There
    is the non-PvP portion of the game, and then there is the PvP portion of the game.
    Unfortunately, most of an enchanter's debuffs are more suited to PvP than non-PvP. If you
    are involved in PvP, then debuffing is an absolute must. If you are in non-PvP mode, then
    debuffing has its uses, but isn't as important.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The basic debuff that enchanters have lots of is strength
    reducers. At the highest levels, an enchanter has the ability to reduce the strength of a
    victim by as much as 100 points. This can have a drastic effect on a player.
    Unfortunately, its effect on other creatures is relatively minimal, and I advise against
    wasting time with strength debuffs when fighting NPC's. Debuffs are a major taunt, so
    frequently the only reasonable time to cast them is once some serious damage has already
    been done. And since there are three different series of spells which act as strength
    debuffs, including our DoT series, by the time all three spells (and one of
    Tashan/Tashani/Tashania, of course) are cast on a single target, the target is almost
    dead.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Besides, the enchanter usually has his hands full simply
    doing crowd control. If an enchanter doesn't have crowd control to do -- especially when
    only ever dealing with one target at a time -- and the duration of the fight is expected
    to last awhile, then strength debuffing has its uses. But my experience is that the extra
    time spent debuffing strength only serves to increase the duration of the fight, and
    therefore the number of times the enchanter gets hit. More-times-hit times
    less-damage-per-hit is approximately equal to fewer-times-hit times more-damage-per-hit.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Using the strength debuffs in PvP, however, can turn a fully
    armored paladin into a nicely rooted weakling who can't budge from his current spot. No
    tank with an ounce of sense would dare to challenge an enchanter more than once....</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The Languid Pace series, however, is usually a very effective
    debuff, since it reduces the attack frequency of the target, and it only requires two
    spells (one from Tashan, one from Languid) instead of four or five spells (one from
    Tashan, one from feeble line, one from disempower line, and our DoT -- and one of these
    three will usually be resisted, requiring it to be cast a second time) to achieve
    virtually the same effect -- reducing the damage taken by the tanks.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Mana Sieve is an interesting debuff. One tactic is to use it
    repeatedly on, say, Lady Vox. It is rumored not to cause hatred in whoever it's cast upon,
    and since Vox never took any real interest in me, despite having cast it six times on her,
    it clearly isn't much of a taunt, in any case. (After all the tanks were dead, and Vox was
    wandering around, she still didn't summon me to her.) However, in most cases, it is not
    all that useful. Drain 200-350 points of mana from the target, or do 200-350 point of
    damage to it? Which is more effective? In general, since NPC's have so much more mana than
    PC's, Mana Sieve is pointless. Against PC's, however, it can be quite effective, since it
    can be used, against an enthralled PC wizard, for example, to drain away all his mana,
    leaving him completely helpless.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Couple that with some strength debuffs, and the wizard is
    stuck for good.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The enchanter also has a spell for reducing intelligence and
    wisdom (Curse of the Simple Mind), but its utility is debatable. While it could be used to
    lower the INT and WIS of a foe, and thereby reduce the size of his mana pool, Mana Sieve
    is probably better at just stripping away the mana to begin with.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Taper Enchantment, Cancel Magic, Nullify Magic, and
    especially Strip Enchantment and Pillage Enchantment, are all quite useful debuffs. In
    particular, against shamans that SoW, this should be the first spell cast against such a
    creature. Anything with magical shielding, too. And, in PvP, it is vital to use. Stripping
    away buffs before actually engaging an enemy PC reduces the toughness of that PC by at
    least a couple levels. An enthralled target can easily have his buffs stripped -- just
    beware that you could strip off the Enthrall, too, and so be ready to regain control.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Buff Management</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>As an enchanter increases in level, he becomes called upon
    more and more to cast a wide assortment of beneficial spells on other players. Clarity is
    the one that will get requested most often, but there are plenty of other buffs in an
    enchanter's arsenal, and a good enchanter will see to it that his party members have the
    best available buffs at all times, conditions permitting.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>An enchanter should always keep himself buffed when in battle
    situations.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>There are basically ten or so different buff lines that an
    enchanter acquires over his lifetime, along with a couple others which limited usefulness.
    However, rather than discuss what these buffs are, I would like to discuss tactics for
    making sure that your party and your friends never lack your buffs.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In particular, Clarity will be requested often. It costs 75
    mana, which is maybe ten seconds worth of Clarity-enchanced mana regeneration, but being
    able to cast this on others will net the enchanter more good will than an infinity of
    SoW's. So mana management becomes vital. The next section will discuss this more fully.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>A handy tactic I learned from a cleric in my early years was
    to buff one's self first, and then buff everyone else. Since buffs last the same amount of
    time, regardless of who they are cast on, this gives the enchanter a way to know which
    buffs are wearing off, so that he can apply them before the party needs to ask. This works
    well for any buff the enchanter keeps on himself. Quickness is one series that tanks will
    need to be trained to ask for, unless the enchanter wants to a) buff himself with it, too,
    or b) use an actual stop watch for timing purposes. Using the stop watch would put you
    into the realm of Master Buffer. I could never bring myself to that point. If you manage
    to perfect this, so that you're already buffing someone before they are asking for it, and
    no one ever actually has to ask for a buff, then you've far exceeded my perfectionism in
    this topic, and I will be required to kneel before you should I ever see you.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Try to spread out buffs. Some buffs have different durations,
    and so there will be times when two buffs start wearing off together. This is also part of
    mana management, and with practice, you can keep buffs going all night long, simply by
    keeping them rotated.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>As a general rule, find out what classes each party member
    is, and what their prime stats are, and also what they plan to do, so that you can know
    which buffs are applicable. There is no reason to cast Clarity on monks (except for
    personal amusement), or Brilliance on a wizard that already has 201 INT. However, you
    might not think to cast a charisma buff on a druid that plans on charming sonic bats --
    but the druid will appreciate it! Keeping your party buffed with the buffs each member
    needs or wants, and still managing to pull off crowd control on groups from hell, and
    still managing to cast Clarity on the line forming outside the room you're camping, and
    still managing to throw in the killing shot on that kobold that's about to start running,
    is actually quite satisfying. Enchanters who manage to pull off all of these things
    simultaneously are the ones who give enchanters a reputation as being a &quot;god
    class&quot;.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Because of the wide variety of buffs that an enchanter (or,
    really, any high-level buff class) has available, it becomes an exercise in managing which
    buffs are memorized, if any. Because of the frequency of requests for Clarity, I would
    often keep Clarity memorized, and swap it out for other buffs as needed. This means a lot
    of opening the spell book to switch out which buffs are memorized. It is painful, but it
    is important to get good at doing it. Now that you can re-arrange your spellbook, you can
    put all your useful spells, and all your buffs, fairly close together, so that they can be
    swapped in and out rather rapidly. With practice, it will become fast and easy to do, and
    no one will ever be more than five seconds away from a buff (mana permitting).</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Once re-arranging the spellbook became possible, I stopped
    keeping Clarity memorized at all in intense battle situations. I would keep a Rune spell
    in the bottom slot, and swap it out with buffs when needed. In fact, my spell list usually
    consisted of:</font></small><ol>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>Cajoling Whispers or Allure or DD/DoT</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>Mesmerization</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>Tashan/Tashani/Tashania</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>Color Shift</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>Mesmerize/Enthrall/Entrance</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>Color Flux</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>Languid Pace/Tepid Deeds/Shiftless Deeds or a fear spell, if
        applicable</font></small></li>
      <li><small><font face='Arial'>Clarity/Rune/Buff/DD/DoT/Debuff/Other slot</font></small></li>
    </ol>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In a buffing crisis (lots of mana, lots of buff requests), I
    would use the lowest two spell slots for buffs, swapping out Tepid Deeds and Rune,
    replacing them once done. With each spell or pair of spells, just spin around and target
    people who need each buff. Once done, switch to another spell or pair of spells and
    repeat. Eventually, the crowd dissipates.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Mana Management</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>An enchanter can double or triple his effective mana by
    simply making sure that he is either expending mana or meditating. In battle situations,
    nothing else matters. Any moment that you can sit to meditate, do so.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Here is an example. Puller pulls three creatures. Enchanter
    enthralls two of them while the party fights the third. The enchanter immediately sits
    down, waits three mana ticks (watch your mana bar!), then stands back up, and casts
    enthrall again on the two enthralled creatures. Then the enchanter sits back down and
    waits three mana ticks, then repeats. Using this method on a single creature, an enchanter
    can not only keep the creature enthralled indefinitely, but also slowly regenerate more
    mana than is being expended keeping the creature enthralled. With only a single creature
    and enthrall, wait four mana ticks. Reduce by one mana tick for each additional creature
    being enthralled. Reduce by one tick for each resist. If more than four creatures, use
    Mesmerization instead. Recast until all desired creatures are under control. (You did
    remember to raise your charisma, didn't you?) Once everything is mesmerized, sit down and
    meditate for tick or two.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Now that Entrance has had its casting time and recast delay
    reduced signficantly, it is now probably sensible to use Entrance at higher levels, which
    would likely allow you to round-robin as many as eight or nine creatures (although with
    very little time for meditation, which makes Mesmerization more likely a better choice).</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>All good spellcasters learn and use this tactic. If you
    aren't casting a spell, you should be meditating. (I copied it from a couple of good
    wizards that I watched doing it.) Clarity is great, but it's no substitute for meditation.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Even better, however, is noticing this one fact: meditation
    and healing occur in &quot;ticks&quot; -- usually around five to six seconds. What the
    game seems to do is this -- every time a tick occurs, it checks to see which
    mana-enhancing effects are in place, and then increases your mana by the amount dictated
    by the conditions that were in effect at the moment of the tick. If Clarity is on, then a
    certain amount (usually not a visible amount each tick) is added to the available mana. If
    the caster is meditating (or merely seated above 35th level) at the moment of the tick,
    then even more is added to the available mana. If both are in place, then even more is
    added. (The bardic mana song seems to do its own thing, using a completely different tick,
    about half-way between the regular ticks, for determining when to add mana.)</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Well, the time of the tick is what is vital. If you can time
    the moment that the tick occurs, then you can stand up, do something, then quickly sit
    back down, and, as long as you are seated (or meditating, if below 35th level) at the
    moment that the tick occurs, then you will be considered to be meditating, and you will
    regenerate mana. You can quickly stand back up, wait about four seconds, then sit back
    down again, and check your mana bar -- again, it will increase.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Now, it is unlikely that you could cast any but the fastest
    casting spells between ticks, but it is possible. Tashan and Color Flux are quick-casting,
    and can easily fit in between ticks. Other spells just manage to squeak in -- although the
    recast delay is more of the issue here.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>When you combine Clarity and strict mana management, it is
    extremely unlikely that you, the enchanter, will run out of mana ever. (This is not true
    for other spellcasters!) I spent many a night averaging 50% mana, and I would never deny
    Clarity to anyone unless my mana was below 20% -- and even then, it wasn't a denial, it
    was a postponement. There is nothing more exciting in EverQuest than managing a huge
    battle and, near the end, scraping by on 10% mana while still keeping the last two
    remaining creatures enthralled while the party rests before taking on these last two, and
    being able to cast a couple buffs on party members, too, while a third creature spawns,
    and then you manage to get the third one under control, too!</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>If you can manage to do all that, then you aren't just a pro
    -- you're a master in my book.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Defensive Spells</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Enchanters do get minor defensive spells, which, while
    technically buffs, are nevertheless too frequently ignored by enchanters. These spells
    include the Rune series, the Berserker series, and Feedback.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>As you get higher in level, the cost of the various Rune
    spells (up to Rune III, anyway) becomes trivial, and keeping the Rune spells up when in
    battle situations, or during any potential danger, is not only important but also
    life-saving. In the middle of a battle, one of the best spells an enchanter can use to
    protect the life of a friend is to use a Rune spell. Consequently, during battle
    sequences, having Rune memorized, or available to be memorized quickly, really adds value
    to the enchanter.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Even when a creature completely resists the enchanter's
    spells, the creature cannot resist the effects of a damage shield placed on himself or
    someone else.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The Rune series uses spell components, which makes its use
    prohibitive at lower levels. At higher levels, it becomes important always to have jaspers
    on hand to cast Rune III. Rune IV is arguably better, but it requires a spell component
    that costs twelve times as much, and requires 25% more mana, for a mere 25%-30% more
    protection. For defensive purposes, Rune III is generally a better choice. It can be
    recast rather quickly, usually faster than damage is being applied to the target.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>When possible, telling the victim to back off and mesmerizing
    the creature is a better choice. But this isn't always possible. In some cases, the
    creature may be much higher level than the caster. The creature might simply be immune to
    mesmerization. Or the enchanter might be suffering from low charisma at a given moment. In
    these cases, crowd control is difficult to impossible, and so other tactics become
    necessary.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The taunt factor of the Rune series is at least as bad as
    (and probably worse than) healing, so you cannot use them a lot in a fight, without
    risking death.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The Berserker series is a component-free way to give someone
    a damage shield. It is primarily a short-duration strength increaser. It is not much of a
    damage shield, however -- much less than the Rune series -- and it suffers from a penalty
    to agility, which many melee types do not want. Consequently, you will rarely get requests
    for these spells, and I would recommend using them only in a situation where the enchanter
    has no spell components for Rune, and he needs to do something to give the cleric time to
    heal. It is unlikely, however, that these spells would even be memorized when such a
    crisis presents itself, so these spells are unlikely to be useful.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Feedback is a moderately good passive damage spell. It does
    eleven points of damage to any attacker each time the attacker strikes the protected
    creature. It is often ignored by enchanters who spend any amount of time with druids or
    magicians, however, since each of these classes offers a better passive damage spell. But
    when none of these casters is around, or when they are but aren't casting their own
    passive damage spells (fire shield, or thorns, or whatever), buffing the puller with this
    spell before he goes to pull can add up. And if you ever have a pet summoned, using this
    spell on the pet can be useful if the pet is frequently being hit.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Feedback should have been a shield that reflects up to eleven
    points of damage back on the attacker -- not just passive damage, but reflecting some
    damage back. (That's what feedback is -- feeding something sent out back to what fed it.)
    Unfortunately, it's just a passive damage shield. Don't let the name deceive you.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>An enchanter's Haze line of AC-enhancing buffs is better than
    nothing, but not quite what a cleric has available. If you have no cleric or paladin
    around, using these spells can shave a few points of damage off an enchanter during each
    fight -- as well as for anyone else in the party. The effect is largely negligible,
    however. It is probably better for melee types who, with a much higher armor class
    already, might perceive a real difference in damage being done. Use these spells on
    yourself and your pet, but don't expect much from them.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Illusions</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>At higher levels, illusions are more than just useful for
    sneaking into enemy cities. Most illusions have some form of benefit that they bestow on
    the enchanter. Unfortunately, they may only be cast upon the enchanter himself, which
    limits their usefulness.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The first important one is Illusion:Dark Elf, which provides
    Ultravision for those who don't have it. Unfortunately, being a dark elf isn't the best
    way to make friends in most areas of the game, so its uses are somewhat limited.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Illusion: Troll now (finally) grants an extra point of
    regeneration per tick. If you don't have a healer, or your healer is low on mana, then use
    this illusion to help reduce the amount of mana your healer will have to spend, or to
    reduce your own down time. Just don't do it in areas where trolls are hated. Always
    consider any nearby NPC from a distance before approaching him with this (or any other)
    illusion on, of course.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Illusion: Water Elemental grants the ability to breath under
    water. Unlike Enduring Breath, it requires no spell component, but it does alter racial
    faction.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Illusion: Air Elemental grants the ability to levitate. It
    also requires no spell component, and also alters racial faction. With this illusion,
    Aviaks will generally regard the agnostic enchanter indifferently -- not that that matters
    much....</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Illusion: Fire Elemental grants a twelve-point passive fire
    shield. It beats Feedback for damage. If you need a passive damage spell for yourself, use
    this instead. Just beware that many NPC's hate elementals, so don't use this around
    guards.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Illusion: Earth Elemental simply grants +10 STR. Since this
    is the same as the first level enchanter spell, which costs much less mana, there is
    little reason (except perhaps to change racial faction) to use this spell at all.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Illusion: Skeleton is mostly for amusement purposes. While it
    might offer some general protection from undead, don't count on it. In most dungeons, the
    undead there have dungeon-related faction, and racial faction cannot make up for dozens or
    hundreds of deaths to the denizens of the dungeons.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Illusion: Dry Bones Skeleton is similar to Illusion: Skeleton
    -- but it also adds a +25 Sv Fire bonus, which is the only elemental protection spell an
    enchanter ever gets.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Illusion: Spirit Wolf gives enchanters a very indifferent
    faction with most creatures. I guess the thinking is that a Spirit Wolf is pretty much
    ignored by everyone (if you saw a hazy, spirit-like wolf wander by, watching you, but
    otherwise minding its own business, would you be upset?). However, this also includes
    dragons, so the spell can no longer be cast in underground areas, thereby preventing
    enchanters from using this spell to get corpses away from dragons safely. The spell also
    increases the enchanter's attack (ATK) value. If, at 39th level, an enchanter is still
    actually performing any melee at all (which, if he's managing his mana properly, he's
    not), then the small attack bonus might be useful.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Illusion: Werewolf gives enchanters a guaranteed method to be
    KoS to every NPC in the game. It also gives a much larger strength bonus than the first
    level Strength spell, and an attack speed increase, and an attack bonus. Again, any
    enchanter who, at 44th level, finds that his werewolf-enhanced melee is contributing
    enough to his party to justify not meditating at that particular moment, probably needs to
    stop partying with 12th level players. Mostly, this spell is entertaining. It also makes
    the enchanter appear quite distinctive, making him easier to pick out of a crowd. (The
    racial illusions for player races simply make the player appear like another player. The
    elemental illusions make the enchanter look like a magician's pet. The skeletal illusions
    make the enchanter look like a necromancer's pet. The spirit wolf illusion makes the
    enchanter look like all the players with druidic wolf form -- or a shaman's pet. But
    werewolf stands out nicely.)</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>If you are not agnostic, then the racial faction adjustment
    from each illusion is not likely to provide much protection. NPC's smell religious faction
    from across the zone. Benevolence might help, but it's frequently not enough.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Mob Tactics</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>On the various planes, an enchanter is going to be largely a
    buffer, not a crowd controller. It is possible to execute crowd control on certain
    denizens of the planes, but some inhabitants are completely immune to crowd control. It
    will take practice to figure out which ones are which. A creature which resists all crowd
    control efforts will be designated throughout this section as &quot;CCRC&quot; --
    &quot;Crowd Control Resistant Creature&quot;.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Charming, on the other hand, is great when it can be
    executed. Some creatures are more charmable than others on the planes, and finding out
    which are easily charmed is one of the more painful but necessary lessons that an
    enchanter has to learn.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>However, an enchanter can usually sit back and simply cast
    Clarity and Celerity when requested, and everyone will probably be quite content. Dragons
    and the planes are portions of EverQuest meant to humble the &quot;god-like&quot;
    enchanter. The tactics which have served him so well and made him so &quot;god-like&quot;
    elsewhere are no longer applicable.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Even with Tashania, and being 49th level, every spell I cast
    at Nagafen was completely resisted. 100%. The only spells I ever managed to cast on a
    dragon with any apparent success were irresistible ones -- Tashania, and Mana Sieve. Even
    with Tashania, no DoT, no DD, no mind-altering spell -- nothing I could cast had any
    effect on Nagafen.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Consequently, the enchanter has to switch operating modes.
    The enchanter can no longer control things the way he learned to. And, peculiarly, the
    tactics that serve in this instance are exactly the tactics that worked before anyone ever
    learned how to work with an enchanter.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In brief, <i>the enchanter isn't an enchanter any more</i>.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In these situations, the enchanter buffs. The enchanter can,
    in most situations, attempt to play a poor wizard. This does put the enchanter at some
    risk of death, but usually, in these situations, the enchanter isn't doing enough damage
    to get the attention of whatever he's blasting, unless he's the only one blasting it. The
    solution, then, to keep the enchanter alive, is to blast only the primary target.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Memory Blur, Mind Wipe, and the other hate list wiping spells
    become a lot handier in these situations. Mind Wipe, the area effect Memory Blur, can be
    used to good effect to make all the NPC's in an area back off whoever they're frenzied on.
    Memory Blur and Mind Wipe do not cause aggression in targets, so they're very safe for an
    enchanter to cast. If someone needs to back off, but something is frenzied, it's time to
    wipe the hate list.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Clerics can use their Atone spell just like the enchanter's
    Memory Blur. But Mind Wipe will nicely hit all fire giants at once (and all PC's, for that
    matter), regardless of which player or NPC is currently targeted.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Wiping the hate list is a good way to attempt to get the
    credit for the kill, so doing so without reason is likely to cause some concern among some
    players. Make sure that this is used for the purpose of handling frenzy, not attempting to
    steal kills (which is actually quite hard to time correctly when everyone is fighting a
    pair of fire giants...), and let people know that that's the purpose beforehand.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>There is a holding tactic which could be used by a small team
    to keep a single CCRC occupied while the main force handles another CCRC. Of course, if
    you are fighting a mixture of such creatures, then the entire fighting force should be
    made aware that the CCRC's are to be fought first, while the enchanter keeps the
    controllable entities in check.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The team for this requires four members: a caster capable of
    wiping the hate list, a healer, and two tanks. Both tanks initially attack the CCRC. The
    healer is responsible for keeping everyone healthy. The hate list wiper is responsible for
    keeping the CCRC switching targets. If a tank starts to get injured too badly, then the
    hate list wiper must begin wiping the hate list. It may take two or three castings for it
    to take effect, so the wiper cannot wait until the tank is down to 20% health -- it should
    start around 50%. The tank also needs to back off the moment he reaches 50% of his hit
    points.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The healer simply heals when he can, and meditates while
    waiting. Once a tank has backed off, the healer waits until the giant has switched to the
    other, healthier tank, before healing the more injured tank, thereby reducing the risk
    that the CCRC will frenzy on the healer.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>The group needs to keep this up until the main fighting force
    switches to the CCRC being held in check with this method. The healer, to be effective
    here, must practice mana management. The hate list wiper should be capable of doing backup
    healing or defense, such as an enchanter with Rune III available. The primary healer could
    run out of mana, even with mana management, so having quick back-up measures can be very
    important.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Tactics -- Fear</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Fear is a useful tactic, but it is lethal in many areas. In
    general, it should not be used in areas where a feared creature might reasonably encounter
    friends, or might encounter creatures who are significantly higher level than you are.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>For example, using a fear spell against the spectres in The
    Feerrott is generally a useful tactic. If you're fighting spectres, you probably have a
    reasonable chance of standing up to anything in the area -- at least long enough to flee
    to a zone boundary. Using fear to drive away spectres while your pet attacks them, or
    while you blast them, or both, is generally a sound tactic.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>However, using this tactic in Oasis of Marr on desert madmen
    or dry bone skeletons will ordinarily result in massive trains of death, including the
    potential for your pet to aggrivate a sand giant or two, all of whom will be very
    interested in demonstrating their appreciation for your pet's invading their territory.
    Even if your pet is half-way across the zone. Then again, if you're 50th level, you and
    your pet stand a reasonably good chance of defending yourselves against even a sand giant,
    so using fear here can be an entertaining diversion.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>So it does require some judgment as to when fear spells can
    be reasonably used.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In general, never use fear spells in a dungeon, or in an
    enclosed area, far from a zone line. Besides the potential for starting trains which are
    lethal to you, you could also bring about the deaths of many other visitors to your zone.
    Avoid using it.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Be especially careful when using it with your pet. Letting
    your pet chase something down and kill it while it is running away is a very workable,
    very easy tactic to employ, but you are guaranteed to have something come back to you --
    either your pet, or one or more hostile creatures. Repeatedly hit the F1 key to toggle
    between targeting yourself and targeting your pet. If you cannot target your pet, prepare
    for an incoming hostile.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Guk is a great place not to use fear spells. Frogs from
    half-way across the dungeon could find their way to you -- dozens of angry amphibians, all
    interested in demonstrating the &quot;hospital&quot; in &quot;hospitality&quot;.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Fear is also useful to send something away so that you and
    your party members can flee. Fear is better than Mesmerize since Fear will not be broken
    by damage from a stubborn party member, whose honor demands that he not leave. You can
    also cast Memory Blur on a fleeing target, and, as long as the blur isn't resisted, the
    target will forget about its former enemies. The biggest problem is managing to get this
    spell off before the fleeing creature runs too far away, resulting in an &quot;out of
    range&quot; message.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Patch Day</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Your best resource as an enchanter can be found at
    http://eq.castersrealm.com/. Besides being a great resource for all things enchanter, this
    site also includes news and updates, including reports on all the nifty things that have
    been added in the most recent patch.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>In general, you will find that patch day is always full of
    unexpected surprises, usually in the form of announced or unannounced nerfs. Spell effects
    can change. Durations are a favorite target of the tuning team. Resistances can be
    modified. Some NPC's may have acquired new resistanaces or immunities, and the only way
    you'll know is by getting surprised when that resistance or immunity gets you killed or
    nearly so -- unless you check out Caster's Realm or some other news site to find out these
    things.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>If you're going to play EverQuest, never expect the physical
    laws of the gaming universe to remain constant. If you're going to play an enchanter,
    always expect something to have changed after a patch. Be pleasantly surprised if nothing
    has.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>To be fair, patches aren't always done with the express
    purpose of crippling enchanters. Most spell-casting classes suffer from this problem at
    some point, and even the melee types are getting a taste of it, too.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><b>Conclusion</b></font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>To finish this discussion, I would like to make a few
    comments to an aspiring enchanter.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>As an enchanter, you have, or will have, a considerable
    amount of power available to you, as long as you get your intelligence and charisma to up
    near 200. Charisma is arguably more important, but you have spells which help with that.
    But there is a price to be paid for this power. That price is your dependence on others
    for optimum performance.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>An enchanter manipulates the world around him to achieve the
    desired result. The enchanter doesn't adapt to his environment -- he adapts his
    environment to himself. And that is the element of an enchanter which moves him toward
    being divine, as opposed to being merely an animal. It is the essential quality of mankind
    which demonstrates superiority to mere animals, and enchanters must possess and exercise
    this quality in order to become masters of their craft.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Gods create the environment. Men alter the environment.
    Animals mindlessly accept the environment.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>This is true for all classes. Every character class has
    masters. But enchanters require this attitude more than any other class. A master warrior
    has far fewer options available to him for dominating his environment. An enchanter has
    more options than anyone else.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>This generally means that an enchanter is constantly in more
    danger than anyone else. While most sensible spellcasters will wait until the melee types
    have thoroughly annoyed the enemy before casting an offensive spell (since initially
    casting massive damage at something is guaranteed to make the caster the creature's most
    favored target), an enchanter doesn't ordinarily have the luxury of waiting around. He
    can't let the tanks tank -- he has to get in there and seize control of the battle. This
    takes complete courage in the face of an enemy. An enchanter doesn't have time to think
    about fleeing, because, once the battle has begun, he is too weak to flee. Succeed, or die
    trying. Running, unless you're just a few seconds from a zone line, means almost certain
    death.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>A resisted Enthrall means that the enchanter has to enthrall
    an attacker, instead of merely an enemy. Press on, enchanter. If you keep at it, you will
    either get Enthrall to stick, or you will die. If you died, then, chances are, you were in
    over your head, anyway.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>Remember that improvement is always possible. Even a master
    can improve. It is always advisable to experiement with new tactics, but never rely on
    anything which hasn't proven itself to you. Practice is the key. Don't decide to start
    practicing a new technique at the beginning of seven-on-five fight. Try new things on
    slow, two-foe fights. And bear in mind that the price for your practicing might very well
    be your life. Don't let it cost others their lives, too.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'>If something I've told you simply does not work, even with
    200 charisma, even with two clerics chain-healing you, even following the advice here <i>exactly</i>
    as I've given it, then abandon it and find a better method. Don't ever stop looking for
    something better. But never abandon effective tactics until better tactics have proven
    themselves.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face='Arial'><i>And finally, never forget how much you depend on others
    for your success. Your strength is the strength you give to or take from others, whether
    they're your allies or your enemies. You need both allies and enemies to succeed.</i> </font></small></td>
