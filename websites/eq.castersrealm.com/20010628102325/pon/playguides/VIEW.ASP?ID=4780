  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p><br>
Greetings fellow Holy Warrior! I am Cellestia Starlite. I live on
the Drinal server and am a Paladin of Level 25, though with my
new found realm of experience, expect level 26 by the end of the
week. The bit of advice is to inform you of what I found to be
the best experience for a young Paladin. This includes what I
have done to what I am doing now.<br>
<br>
Level 16 Paladin &#150; Welcome to Unrest.<br>
<br>
At level 16 I first ventured to unrest. It was filled with new
creatures I hadn&#146;t come across before including Greater
Skelles and Tormented Dead (Some of the ugliest NPC&#146;s I&#146;ve
seen yet). I came here as I heard the loot was good and the XP
was as well. Also, with my new lev 16 spells I got my first
Direct Damage spell, Ward Undead. It started rough and throughout
my time at unrest I dealt with terrible trains of creatures I
care not to meet again for a few more levels and I experienced
many a deaths. It isn&#146;t so bad once you find a group. I
notice that as you get higher in level it is easier to find a
group and your group tends to be more capable. I found out soon
enough that my role in a group varied allot, but became more
defined as I grew in level. I found that I work best as a Melee
player and back up healer. I tried never to be the main tank, as
you can&#146;t cast if you are being attacked. I usually was the
one casting &#147;Ward Undead&#148; while assisting the main
tank. I also kept an Eye on the main tank and if the Cleric or
other healer muttered the three letters that the tank most
dreaded &#147;OOM&#148;, I knew that my role was about to change.<br>
<br>
Level 17-22 &#150; Allot of movin&#146; around<br>
<br>
I remain in unrest for the majority of my next few levels, with
occasional trips to West Commons for a change of scenery. I did
get a good deal on a GhoulBane, which helps allot in Unrest. If
you have high dexterity and want to use 1h slash an increase that
Bash skill, I suggest you try and get one of these. This weapon
looks like a standard 2h sword, but is handled one handed. It has
a damage of 15 and a delay of about 36, is magic, and is a light
source. Most important, it has a special effect of Dismiss
Undead. Although you cannot take advantage of this effect till
after level 20, it doesn&#146;t hurt to have this weapon sooner
to start practicing that 1h slashing. When this weapon procs it
will do max damage of 132 damage to undead, which will increase
by 2 damage points each level there after. <br>
I spent some time in the Lake of Il Omen at level 21 fighting
some of the big skelle&#146;s in a group and then grouping in the
Fort. This is good XP and good moderate loot, but it is a
relatively long haul to a zone should things get messy. I gain a
level or two there and inevitably headed back to Unrest since
there is nowhere for me to train or to buy my level 22 spells.<br>
I finally pull through to Level 23 (maybe a couple times&#133;).
I was with a good group in Unrest and someone suggested because
of how crowded it was gettingm that we might want to head to
Mistmore. I had never been to Mistmore before, but it sounded
like a good idea, so I figured I&#146;d give it a shot.<br>
<br>
Level 23+ - Welcome to Mistmore!<br>
Mistmore is on the opposite side of the Greater Faydark zone in
Lesser Faydark. best bet from Greater Faydark is to run along the
wall to the right and avoid anything that you haven&#146;t met
before. The zone will be a placed where the green hill turns to
gray rock. There will be a ruined Druid ring there as well.<br>
Mistmore is perfect for a level 20+ group. My group consisted of
a wizard, an enchanter , two clerics, a druid, and a warrior
along with myself. I have been there now since level 23 (last
week!) and now am three orange bubbles from level 26. Here, you
will find Dark elf Familiars near the beginning of the zone which
are around the low lev 20&#146;s. At 23, most of them coned blue
or even. Now at 25 they are all blue. These are sometimes rouges
and sometimes more like wizard. The casters do more damage as
they use wizard like nuke spells, but have less HP. The rouges
you do not want to turn your back on or they can back stab you
for over 160 damage. Usually my group would have someone pull,
usually would bring back 2 to 5 dark elves. The best was to bring
them close to the zone, should a train form. Taunt your targets
as much as you can and keep them off the casters/healers. Use
your level 22 root spell to pull, especially if you do not have a
SoW. If you are pulling a caster, try to keep out of their line
of sight. If you pull a group, I suggest taking out the caster
first, but do not turn you back on the rouges. If you ignore the
casters, they can really put out some damage.<br>
Zone if things get to tight and don&#146;t wander to far toward
the castle at this level. Just keep fighting the &#147;Yard Trash&#148;.
You will find that most of your group members will stay there for
days as you will to. You become familiar with what your group can
and cannot handle and you just keep racking up the XP. You also
can expect to pull over 1 PP off of just about every third kill.
Sometimes as much as 2 and a half PP and this is with autospit
on! In addition, if your group takes the gargoyles, you can loot
their eyes which sell to merchants for 8 to 9 PP alone!<br>
<br>
Summary<br>
I&#146;m still in Mistmore now. Most of my group still meets me
there. Our highest level is the clerics at 29 and I am still
racking up very good XP at level 25 with a full group. I find we
can take the same yard trash with a group of 4, but I cam pull
almost constantly when we have a full group. This keeps everyone
busy and keeps the XP and cash flowin&#146;. As I get higher
levels, I pull close to the front gate and generally my group can
take out a pull of 6 or 7 initiate familiars. We can also take
out some of the bigger stuff from the grave yard when it wanders
along with our pulls. Occasionally our group still has to zone
and it is not uncommon to lose one of our casters, but all they
lose is some experience which is quickly replaced. They are
usually bound right outside the zone and our tanks rarely die if
ever. I think I died once since I came here and that was due to
lag. It is by far the overall best place I have found to hunt at
my level. I suggest you give it a try. At level 24 you might even
be able to solo some of the yard trash if you use your yelp,
root, and heal spells carefully. Good Luck and Have Fun! </p>
