<p class="MsoNormal">“Cycko!! Get up!!”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I knew exactly who it was and why 
she was waking me up. “Kan, please go back to bed. It’s not even daybreak.” I 
turned over and grabbed my pillow and stuffed it over my head. Then I felt a 
nudge on my shoulder. “C’mon Cycko!! Pleeeease!!” I turned over to see the 
person I wanted to choke. Kandria was my best friend. A friendship frowned upon 
by most, her being a dark-elf and myself, a human.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;“Kan, please. It is dark out 
still, you are going to wake up my father, and it’s colder outside than even 
most barbarians prefer!! Now go back to sleep….zzzzzzz”&nbsp; I heard an abrupt “Hmph!” 
Just as soon as I though I had won this battle and start to doze off, I heard a 
giggle. My eyes bolted wide open! “No Kan, DON’T!!!!” Too late…&nbsp; I heard the 
chant, saw the flash, and then I felt my inside heat up like a bon fire. “Still 
cold, Cyc?” That was the last straw. “You are so dead!” She disappeared from the 
window, leaving nothing but the echo of roaring laughter. “Cyc, what are you 
doin’!?! It’s too early for this nonsense!! Go back to sleep!!” </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“Sorry Father!! I was getting 
ready to go to training today! I have to go! See ya tonight!” Saying all that, I 
got my training tunic, my yellow sash, and started out the window after Kandria.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“Not so fast!! Come here, boy!” As 
I was caught offguard by my father’s booming voice, I tripped halfway out the 
window, landing on my head in the dirt. Once again, laughter from the bushes. 
Turning red with anger I shot a glare to the bushes and she quieted…somewhat. 
“Coming Father!!” I rushed back inside through the front door to see my father, 
up for the day, making tea. I though for sure, a scolding was coming. To my 
surprise he was smiling. “She really gets to you, eh?” With a hidden blush, I 
looked down. “Just teasing boy. But there is something I wanted to talk to you 
about. I’m glad you are leaving early for training because I need you to come 
home at dusk. There is something I need to talk to you about.” I looked at him 
puzzled, but all I saw was that grin. “Nothing you should worry about. Just get 
home at dusk. We are going to have dinner at the Jade Inn. You got it?” I 
nodded. “Alright, give me a hug and get going! You don’t want to keep her 
waiting do you?” Acting like his last comment wasn’t heard, my father limped 
around the table to meet me. I hugged him, and bolted out the door.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">It really pained me to see my 
father’s injury. It wasn’t right and it wasn’t fair. Yet, I was proud. He was 
one of the greatest warriors in Freeport and probably Antonica too. He was a 
hero. It was a few years ago when I had first starting my training that he was 
almost killed. There are probably a handful of people that could have endured 
what he did and lived to tell about it. I was away traing with the masters of 
Qeynos. Years ago, the lands were threatened by a dragon; the result of a 
powerful spell gone awry. None knew the source of the magic, but a dragon in 
these parts of Antonica was not natural. It was a giant, green dragon…..a dragon 
with no name. No one had ever seen this creature, and almost all dragons in 
Norrath were well documented, as there were so few and dangerous. Lady Vox of 
Permafrost, Nagafen in the great dungeon of Solusek, and others. But there was a 
common agreement between dragonkind and the rest of Norrath. They mind their own 
business and we mind ours. And there were never any real problem. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Except this green dragon. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">He appeared out if thin air and 
started terrorizing the residents of Oasis and started making its way north to 
Freeport. The army of Freeport mobilized its forces and marched to confront the 
beast. After a half a day’s battle the remaining half of Freeport’s forces 
returned.&nbsp; At the time, my father was a commander in the Freeport Military. 
Returning to his command post, he entered the building where the generals 
resided. “What do you have to report?” one of the generals asked, not even 
raising an eye from the maps he was studying. “Sir, no army, by any means, is 
capable of defeating this foe!” Coming from from anyone else, they would have 
been kicked right out of there and shunned for cowardice. But as it was my 
father, a very respected commander by both soldier and officer, all of the 
generals looked up at my father in disbelief. Wearing armor half charred by 
dragonfire, my father said, “Come. Come see for yourselves.” Walking out of the 
military building and climbing up to one of the posts to the wall around 
Freeport, they saw a horrid sight. The army camp set up outside was full of 
soldiers carrying the wounded and injured back from battle. As the men laid the 
wounded down for medical attention, they started sprinting back to get more of 
the fellow soldiers. Calls from all of the camps were heard, “Cleric!! We need a 
Cleric!” constantly like an echo. White robe clerics were rushing out to aid the 
injured. A few men screamed from the realization that they were missing limbs. 
Women cried at the lose of their men. One the generals, newly promoted, sniffed, 
obviously torn at the hideous site, and looked away. “Ok, let us retire and 
discuss the matter.” Back at the military building, officers were arguing back 
and forth about different strategies. My father watched quietly as debating 
escalated to shouting. Having had enough, my father stood up. “Gentlemen!!” The 
tone of my father’s voice, commanding but not loud, quieted even his superiors. 
“I’ve seen enough bloodshed today. Arguing will get us nowhere. We must act and 
act quickly. The dragon advances and we are bickering about the best strategy?!? 
I have said it before. And I will say it only once more. But this time I want 
you to listen to me. No army, by any means, can defeat this foe!! Do you 
understand?” The room was silent and my father was attacked with blank stares 
across the room. Shaking his head in frustration, he continued. “You guys 
didn’t, by chance, notice that this beast took out half our forces IN LESS THAN 
A FEW HOURS?!?” Those last six words had everyone in the room wincing and even 
made some people in the camp area start up. “Do you have a better idea, Widge?” 
“Yes I do” and started for the door. “Where are you going??” My father turned 
and looked at everyone slowly as he said, “I know most of you distrust magic. 
But we can’t do this alone. I’m going to the mages for help.” Grumbles and 
groans from almost everyone but not one objection.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“Widge? What brings you to our 
conclave?” The high wizard looked at my father with interest. “I think you are 
well aware of my reasons. We need your help. It is obvious that the military 
alone can’t defeat the dragon.” </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“I’m glad one of you came to your 
senses before the entire town was wiped out. However, we are having our own 
issues with the beast as well. I’m not sure if we can offer much help.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“What do you mean? I don’t 
understand.” </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“Of course you don’t. You are a 
warrior.” Flushing, my father got up to leave. “Wait, I apologize for being so 
rude but we are a bit frustrated as well. I will try to explain. We have been 
observing the dragon and the battle from here try to figure out a weakness to 
defeat this creature. From what we can figure out, this creature has none. We 
have never”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“That’s impossible!!” Widge 
retorted. “No one is invincible, not even a dragon. We have to think of 
something.” He sat there with the wizard for about an hour or so, thinking up 
different ideas. Everything from an earthquake to hurling a mountain at the 
dragon. But for some reason or another, nothing they came up with seemed viable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Suddenly my father’s face lit up. 
“I got it!!” No sooner did he finish his last word, then horns of alarm in the 
city sounded. The dragon was here.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“Quickly!! I need an enchanter and 
a druid. Have them meet me at the city gate immediately!” The high-mage raised 
to retort but before he could start… “Get them now!! Don’t argue. Just GO! 
Now!!!”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">At the city gates, the dragon 
could be seen in the distance. Widge waited no longer than a minute. “We are 
here sir! What is it you need?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“Ok, druid, I need you to make me 
move as fast as the wind and give me a force field of the strongest nature. You, 
enchanter. I need a haste spell cast on me. M y weapons must move with blinding 
speed. Do you understand?” Both nodded. He turned to his army. “Everyone! Listen 
to me! I have a plan that may defeat this foe!!” Cheers from across the field 
drowned his ears. “But I must ask something of all of you. Stay here! Do not 
advance! If the Dragon comes, then you fight with all your might!” Not a word 
was spoken from the crowd. Just confused stares. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">“Ok, now.” The druid and the 
enchanter begane to cast, one spells after the other. After they were finished, 
Widge bolted for the dragon, weapons drawn. They men and women were astonished! 
Widge got closer and closer, knowing what he must do. Finally he approached the 
dragon and took his stance. The dragon kept on walking like there was no one 
there. At last the dragon was almost on top of Widge. Then, with lightning 
speed, the dragon’s head whipped around and scooped up Widge in his mouth and 
swallowed him whole. He never even missed a step.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Every citizen screamed in terror! 
The High-Mage screamed, “That fool! We are lost now!” The dragon advanced, 
increasing his speed to a run. Then he jumped in the air and took flight. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Everyone in town just stopped what 
they were doing….everything. People stopped panicking, stopped running and 
fleeing, stopped dead in their tracks. Even the children stopped crying. 
Everyone knew what was coming. The end. There was no way anyone could escape the 
wrath of a dragon in flight. Not a building in town, not even a stone could 
withstand the awesome heat and power of dragonfire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">He circle for a few moment getting 
ready to begin his decent, just as soon as he begane to dive, the dragon began 
to contort and convulse violently. Then suddenly the the beast came crashing to 
the ground right in front of the camp on the field and began thrashing about. 
The crowd didn’t know whether to scream in terror or to cheer. Then the dragon 
stopped. He was dead. Everyone&nbsp; began to approach slowly. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">A sword ripped throught belly of 
the beast then sliced it wide open. Widge nearly fell out and dragged himself a 
few feet from the dragon. His leg was shattered from the crash. Otherwise he 
just needed to catch his breath. He defeated the dragon. Alone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The town held a festival a week 
later to celebrate victory. It was just in time for I returned the same day. 
After hearing about the heroism of my father, I was shocked! So much had 
happened while I was gone. A dragon invaded the town, killed half the citizens, 
and my father became a crippled hero. Since the towns’ military force was cut in 
half and most of those remaining could not return to duty. The reminder of the 
town’s people formed a militia to keep the town secure. I decided to continue my 
training here in Freeport to look help after my father. </p>
