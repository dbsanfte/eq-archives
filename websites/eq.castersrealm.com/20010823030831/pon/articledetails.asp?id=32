</tr>
<tr> 
<td width='80%'><p>I was thinking the other day about Everquest and the role that Paladins play
in the land of Norrath. After a few minutes of research, looking at the
descriptions of all the gods, what they stand for and finding out which ones can
have warriors (Paladins) dedicated to them, I have reached a few conclusions.
<ul>
  <li>Most of us in Everquest do not have the same Idea of what a Paladin is.
    Lets get a good definition of exactly what a Paladin is. We can go from
    there. This is what Verant has to say: ' Paladins are the very picture of a
    holy knight, fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of his life. They
    share some of the power of a Cleric, and a good deal of the fighting ability
    of a Warrior, but have a few powers all their own. '
  <li>Not all Paladins are after the same thing. The thought that all paladins
    are always kind, compassionate Warrior-Priests is just dead wrong in the
    land of Norrath. Lets take a few of the gods and see what their main goals
    are. This will give us some insight to how their chosen Warriors-Priests
    would react.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>BRELL</i>:</b> 'Followers of Brell Serilis believe that the surface
world is a waste of space. They find true happiness in the caves,caverns and
tunnels that perforate the belly of Norrath. But this is one of few points that
all followers of Brell can agree upon. There are many different factions who all
worship Brell. The Runny Eye Clan of Goblins claim he is their father much to
the disgust of the Dwarves of Kaladim, who know that the Dwarves are the true
children of Serilis. But the vicious Gnolls of Split Paw disagree entirely. For
was it not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? Followers
of Brell Serilis in one form or another can be found nearly anywhere you enter
the Underfoot of Norrath.' Does this mean that followers of Brell would be very
concerned about surface dwellers? I think not. Brell's 'true' children, his 'Holy
Warriors' would be focused on ridding the world of those bastard-children, ie
Goblins, Gnolls and other assorted evil ground dwellers. Their clerical nature
would make any undead abhorent but it would not make them ' loving and
compassionate ' toward anybody except maybe other dwarves.</p>
<p><i><b>EROLLISI MARR</b></i><b>:</b> Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the
belief that love conquers all. It should be pointed out that while love is a
generally peaceful concept, Erollisi worshippers are not pacifists. They would
like to live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and violence does not
exist but they are not naïve enough to think that Norrath is that world. They
have passionate loves of people, places and ideas and are more than willing to
fight and die to preserve those things. The dream of every follower of Erollisi
is to die in selfless defense of someone or something they love. Many Paladins
hear the true calling of their hearts and follow Erollisi Marr. 'Erollisi Marr,
ahh.. the lover of all.' If you must play a Paladin who is kind and
compassionate toward all, then this is the goddess to follow. And, you can even
make it more fun by having compassion toward the undead. By relieving them of
their pain ( ie: destroying them ). The followers of Erollisi Marr would be the
ONLY paladins who would have compassion for the evil races/classes. This is
because of the underlying belief that 'Love conquers all.'</p>
<p><i><b>KARANA</b></i>: 'Followers of Karana believe in the absolute power of
storms. They worship the life giving power of the rain and respect the
destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane. Typical followers of Karana are
rural humanoids, farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer
shelter from the elements to strangers. Many Karana followers live a nomadic
lifestyle, travelling where the winds take them. They are humble, generous
people who value strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana and his
work for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of
Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.' Followers of Karana would tend
to be awestruck and humbled at the power of the storms. They would help the
traveler as needed. They would have the typical abhorance of undead. These
Paladins would have a lot in common with Rangers in their reverence of nature.
Because they value strength and honesty, they would in retrospect be angered by
those who live a lifestyle of dishonesty and pride. Weakness, because of
limitations, is understood but weakness such as cowardice or brashness (two
forms of the same weakness) would be looked upon as distasteful at best.</p>
<p><b><i>MITHANIEL MARR</i>:</b> 'The Followers of Mithaniel Marr believe that
valour is what separates civilized beings from beasts. His followers live by a
strict moral code that prizes truth, honor, and charity. They are champions of
the downtrodden and the most noble of warriors. His followers strive to rid
Norrath of all things dark and evil, often sacrificing themselves in this never
ending quest. They will not rest until the day when all of Norrath is cleansed
in Mithaniel's light.' They take themselves and their duty very seriously, and
have little patience for mischief or mayhem. Many Paladins are devout servants
of Mithaniel Marr. Followers of Mithaniel Marr are the most ruthless when it
comes to battling those forces of evil known as Ogres, Trolls and Dark Elves as
well as the Necromancers and Shadowknights that plauge the land. They are
utterly ruthless when dealing with those types. They would be compassionate IF
and only IF one of the evil races was trying to be good, but NEVER with one who
has chosen the dark path of Necromancy or Shadowknight.</p>
<p><b><i>PREXUS</i>:</b> 'Followers of Prexus believe true power lies in the
vast depths of Norrath's oceans. They believe that eons ago life first formed in
the murky deep and that one day the oceans shall rise again to consume those who
are unworthy and to embrace the faithful. The Oceanlord's servants tend to live
and work near, on, or beneath large bodies of water. They seek to spread the
word of Prexus to all who will hear and defend the oceans and seas of Norrath
against any who would cause them harm. Many sailors and fishermen are followers
of Prexus.' Not much is really known about how the followers of Prexus would
react to anything except to say that they would be very upset with any who would
foul the waters of Norrath. This includes all the inland waters also. (thus
their hatred of Necromancers, Shadowknights, Goblins and other evil creatures.)
Currently there are not many things to do underwater, but the followers of
Prexus would be against the defiling of the oceans. They as Paladins would still
have the total abhorance of all things undead.</p>
<p><b><i>TUNARE</i>: </b>'Followers of Tunare believe that we are all Tunare's
children. The children of Tunare seek to help Norrath, which they believe to be
a living and breathing Being, to blossom and grow. Followers believe that the
world of Norrath gave birth to Tunare and from her all life has sprung forth.
Thus, by worshipping and protecting the land, followers are paying homage and
respect to The Mother of Their Mother, who in turn protects and provides for
them. Followers of Tunare will fight to the death to protect nature in all it's
forms.' Many Druids, Rangers, and a great many Elves follow the ways of Tunare.
Followers of Tunare would have a fine line to walk when it comes to being
compassionate yet still caretakers of the land. They should be compassionate to
all who ask for compassion but they would be very fierce in their protection of
those people/creatures who would defile the land with evil and cause the land to
stop growing. When it comes to necromancers and Shadowknights, the paladins of
Tunare would be fanatical in their dislike/hatred. They would want to destroy
anything that fouls the land.</p>
<p>To me, this shows that all paladins have some common belief's but not all.
For instance where Paladins of Erollisi could love their enemies and have
compassion for all, no other Paladin society would feel that way. All the other
Paladin societies would feel that not only is it their Duty, but their Honor as
well to fight and kill any and all Evil. This includes ShadowKnights and
Necromancers of all races.</p>
