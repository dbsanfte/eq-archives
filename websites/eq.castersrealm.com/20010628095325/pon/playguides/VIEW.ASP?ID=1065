  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>Basically, the group layout and the surroundings determine tactics. 
As a paladin, I've found myself in several different roles (which do overlap)
<P><P>
1. Primary tank. Forget about healing or buffing, 
and put on AC/STR gear. To be beat up on, mauled, 
maimed. Make sure you have the best buffs reasonably
available. Your hitpoints are the party's life as 
much as the caster's mana.  Strength does help 
especially on mobs that are red to you. Strength 
seems to matter less on mobs that are blue. <P><P>

2. Secondary tank. Depending on make-up of group, I 
am assigned to switch off main 
target and get mobs onto myself. This works closely 
with #3. Be careful
with bards and enchanters and necromancers. They will try to 
mesmerize extra mobs, so if you need to get 
mobs off them, try to get the mob onto you, but 
(this is tricky) you cannot
    attack the mob once mesmerized, or it 
will break free. Enchanters/bards usually knows 
enough to tell you exactly what to do :-) If in doubt,
just heal the enchanter... they'll do their job.
<P><P>
3. Secondary healer. I always figure out healing 
order. Do I heal as soon as cleric is oom? Or does 
he have a backup (shaman, druid, etc)? If I'm the 
only
backup, I'll put on select few wisdom gear items, 
but keep most of my tanking gear. Even if others 
are available, always watch hitpoints.  I've saved
lives even with just a regular Heal spell.. giving
enough time for a cleric to get greater heal off.
Once I got greater heal, this became a normal part 
of life for me.
<P><P>

4. Primary healer (don't laugh). Put on all 
wisdom gear, even borrow some, you'll need it. 
As a halfelf, my wisdom is ridiculously low, 
and I make sure my group
    knows this.  At level 41, and a max of 109 wisdom,
I can cast 4 greater heals and have almost enough for
a 5th.  Yes, a druid or shaman can heal more, but 
at least the group doesn't have to worry about me
getting pounded on.  <P>
I consider this one of the best features of paladins.
Numerous times have I substituted as healer when 
there were no others available (though rarely 
before level 39 when you get greater heal).  If I'm
in a sticky situation where my mana might not be
enough, I'm generous with my symbol spell.  An
extra 200 hitpoints means that warrior that is with
me can hold off that much longer before I have to 
worry about healing him/her.
<P>
Tip: Assist the mob to find out what it is attacking,
and heal that person.  You can assist-bounce from 
target to target that way, which especially helps in
large fights (more than one group involved).
<P><P>

5. Puller. You don't get much of a chance to med 
up, so try to be light on the healing/buffing, 
or med during lulls. Honestly, I'm not a very 
good puller (I just don't
    get much practice, since I enjoy playing healer),
 but paladins can do it 
well. I use arrows, stun (extra time to get away! 
That hag? Stun it!), or expulse undead. Do not 
use flash of light once
    you have stun. Never use flash of light in 
dungeons. I tried to play a little with soothe, and 
it's not great. If you know you can handle two 
pulls, but rather
    would have one, go ahead and try it.  High
charisma helps. Do 
not depend on soothe. Get spirit of wolf if 
available.

<P><P>

The key to paladins is helpfulness. I can buff 
myself, pull, tank during fight, stun/bash caster 
mobs, root, heal, buff other party members. Be free 
with
    the symbol spell. Cast our Armor line on other 
tanks as well as yourself (clerics don't use this 
spell... "Guard" is as much mana as a greater heal.) We do well in
    small groups, thanks to our versatility. 
No matter the group, I can make myself useful. 
I sit on my rump meditating as much as casters 
sometimes... and you
    should too. Any mana you can save a caster 
means they have that mana to use in a fight, to 
heal you, to do more damage to the mob. My motto 
is that I'd much
    rather have them have that mana than me. A 
tank without mana means little. A caster yelling 
OOM is bad.
<P><P>
    One thing you want to avoid is being primary 
tank and primary healer. The two things are not 
compatible. We do not recover enough to be able to 
take hits while
    casting. I've done it once, and rather would 
avoid it.  It is a great idea to heal the puller as 
he/her comes in... it's an awesome taunt, and will
help the "real" healer of the group a little, 
especially on overpulls.  By the same token... if
you are lower level and lots of higher levels mobs
are being pulled.. you may want to hold off on that
heal.
<P><P>
    Then last, but not least. Make sure your group 
knows their role. Any caster's life is to med, med 
and med some more. If they have full mana, and 
nothing is
    happening, they should freely be buffing their 
party members. Personally, I never ask for strength 
buffs unless offered. I avoid becoming encumbered. 
I do ask for
    dexterity buffs if I'm using a proc'ing 
weapon. If anyone is casting buffs on themselves 
(and said buff is not self-only), they should buff 
others as well. Rangers
    should always be casting Skin like xxx, it 
overrides our AC/hitpoint line, and they need mana 
about as much as we do :-) (Sadly I found few that 
do this without
    my prompting.) If you find yourself in a group 
that isn't working well, and you aren't having fun, 
or they are rushing into something, get out. 
Sometimes groups just
    don't "click". A small, well-working group 
will do better than a full group of mismatched 
people thrown together. (Or, if you feel up to 
taking up the leadership
    mantle, start ordering them around... it works!)
<P>
Tip: if the ranger/druid isn't casting snare... root.
They'll hate it, and start snaring :) or at least
the mob won't run.
