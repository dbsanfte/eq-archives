<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<P>Thats right folks I'm writing chapter 8 now, amazing that its lasted this long, I think this thing could go on for a lot longer than I expected, but then again I do have a good imagination, with luck this series will be finished and the next 2 sequel series to this will be set up soon.
<P>
<P>
<P>Azia kicked and screamed as she was dragged away from Shoken, in her mind he had taken advantage of her and worse yet, he practically blurted out what they had done the night before.  Shoken barely had time to catch his breath before Azia got loose yet again, only this time he leapt to his feet and took off running again.
<P>
<P>"Get back here you bastard!"
<P>
<P>"No way! Your gonna try to kill me!"
<P>
<P>All Ryo could do was laugh at what was happening, it did indeed look like Shoken had met his match.  It was all Shoken could do to keep out of striking distance of Azia as he ran as fast as his feet could carry him out of the building.  Outside they where greeted by screams of shock, and bouts of laughter as Azia lashed out at Shoken again and again.
<P>
<P>"Get back here!!!"
<P>
<P>"Hell no, you'll try to kill me!"
<P>
<P>Azia looked around for something to grab and hurl at Shoken, her eyes laid upon a sword, it appeared old and forgotten as it sat encased in a circle of stones near the blacksmiths house.  Instinctively she took hold of it and ran after Shoken, screaming.
<P>
<P>"All right now your going to get it!!!"
<P>
<P>"Ah somebody stop her!!!"
<P>
<P>While this was all happening Shoken's father had stepped out to watch the scene, a sinister smile crept across his face as he seen Azia take hold of the sword.  She had found the sword he'd created many years ago, and knew that soon it would come to life.
<P>
<P>"Take this you bastard!"
<P>
<P>Azia swung the blade through the air, and in a sudden flash of light it came to life, the rust vanished as mana began to flow into the blade causing it to erupt into a brilliant white glow as it sent out a stream of mana towards Shoken.
<P>
<P>"What in the world?!"
<P>
<P>Shoken turned around just in time to be hit full on by the surge of mana, which sent him skidding across the street and into the side of a building.  All Azia could do was stand in awe at what this sword had done.
<P>
<P>"Well it looks like Azia found the sword we where searching for."
<P>
<P>"Indeed she did Zolf, that's one of the four weapons that where created."
<P>
<P>"Well dears that just leaves the Rapier, and the two staves to find."
<P>
<P>Meanwhile the King had came out to see just what the commotion was about, he smiled as he seen just Shoken's Father.  It had been a long time since they had seen each other, but he knew this meeting meant that something evil was definitely gathering power in the world.
<P>
<P>"So you've come back for the weapons I see, well it looks like that sword finally chose a master."
<P>
<P>"I was rather hoping it would find one sooner, but that doesn't matter now, where did you store the Rapier, and the two Staves?"
<P>
<P>"Why the Rapier is deep in the heart of the Lesser Faydark, and one of the Staves resides deep under the waters of Dagnors Cauldron."
<P>
<P>"And what of the last?"
<P>
<P>"It lies in the hands of Meldrath, in the steamfont mountains, thankfully the last time he tried to use the staff it nearly killed him."
<P>
<P>Azia in the meantime was glaring at Shoken as he stood back up, it was at this time she rushed in, ready to deliver another wave of mana at him, that is until she seen Ryo's personality take control. Instead the mana wave dissipated.
<P>
<P>- Why the hell did you do that? -
<P>
<P>- Well you where making us look like a complete fool, besides at least now she's not attacking us. -
<P>
<P>- I suppose your right... -
<P>
<P>"I suggest we hurry and find these other three weapons, that way we get done quicker, and can get this blasted journey over with."
<P>
<P>"Well then who will go with who?"
<P>
<P>Daxster looked around, he knew they where going to have to split up, but didn't know who was going to go with whom. Rita smiled and spoke up, for one she wanted to get her hands on the Rapier, and another she knew Chaos could ensue if Azia was left alone and Shoken was to come back.
<P>
<P>"Well how about myself, Shoken, Azia, and Zolf head to Lesser Faydark and then onto Steamfont while Zinka, Daxster, and Selena go Dagnors Cauldron?"
<P>
<P>Shoken's father thought about this for awhile, he had a pretty good idea of which weapons would accept whom as their master, and he knew that whom ever was causing these disturbances would most likely seek revenge on them.
<P>
<P>"Well it is a sound idea, I'll wait back here in Felwithe, I have some things to discuss with the King."
<P>
<P>At that they set out for their travels, after Ryo and Azia put on some decent clothes, but for some reason Ryo was exceptionally quiet during the trip to the spires, however not all was quiet within his mind as he and Shoken conversed about what they both felt was going to happen soon.
<P>
<P>- Something's wrong in the air Ryo, something much worse than Mayong. -
<P>
<P>- I'm not a fool, I can feel it as well. -
<P>
<P>- Then lets keep our guard up... -
<P>
<P>- Didn't have to tell me that, I'm not a fool. -
<P>
<P>As they all split off from the spires traveling Daxster and Selena argued about how difficult the agua goblins in the waters of the Cauldron would be.  That is until Zinka spoke up.
<P>
<P>"Don't worry dears, I can turn the little beasties into slobbering drooling dolts."
<P>
<P>"I certainly hope your right, I don't feel like having my ears ripped off and worn as a necklace."
<P>
<P>"If I where you Daxster I'd be more worried about upsetting Ryo again."
<P>
<P>"You do have a point..."
<P>
<P>Unlike the others Ryo and Azia had began to argue about how long this could take, which didn't help matters since they where already standing at the edge of the Lesser Faydark.
<P>
<P>"I say we should split into groups of two. That way we can get this done quickly."
<P>
<P>"And risk being captured or killed? You can't rely on brute strength to save us here, this place is even more dangerous than Mistmoore Castle from what I heard."
<P>
<P>"Well then just use your new toy there, I'm certain with that you and Zolf could handle Meldrath."
<P>
<P>"Fine you jerk, but I'm warning you if you let Rita get hurt trying to get the weapon here I'll give you a beating like I'd give Shoken."
<P>
<P>Ryo just laughed as he started walking off, Rita following after him knowing full well she didn't want to get lost in this forest, sure it was dark and had a similar evil setting about it like her home forest of Nektulos, but this seemed to be far more dangerous, far more sinister. As they neared the center of the forest the weapon came into view, only they had a small problem.  The local brownies had decided to build them a quaint village around it.
<P>
<P>"Ryo stop! That's a Brownie village!"
<P>
<P>"So what if it is, its not like they could hurt m.........."
<P>
<P>Ryo was thrown back as a surge of lightning hit him, a wandering brownie has spotted him and was quick to give him a zap, thinking he was an ordinary intruder, but as anyone knows, Ryo is not ordinary, not by far.
<P>
<P>- Serves you right! -
<P>
<P>- Oh shut up Shoken! -
<P>
<P>"So you wanna pick a fight with me... Fine then, I'm going to have fun squashing you!"
<P>
<P>Ryo stalked forward and began trying to stomp on the brownie, only the brownie laughed and moved to the side each time.  This only proved to infuriate Ryo and cause him to go into a fit of cursing and insults that would certainly make a sailor blush with shame, as well as cause Rita to giggle at.
<P>
<P>"You dirty little bastard! With as tiny as you are your mother probably got laid in a thimble! You short little f......."
<P>
<P>The brownie, not taking lightly to this gave him another shock, and in doing so stopped to long and promptly got its body driven into the ground by Ryo's foot.  With another couple stomps all that was left was a greasy spot on the bottom of Ryo's shoe.
<P>
<P>"Are you done yet, because if so I'll go fetch the weapon so we don't have you making brownie paste here today."
<P>
<P>Ryo smiled slightly, then watched as Rita seemed to disappear from view, though he could clearly feel her presence and hear her footsteps. Moments later the rapier vanished from its holding place.  Rita looked at the weapon as she slowly made her way back to Ryo, finally when she came back into view the Rapier came to life, the rusted appearance faded away to reveal a gem encrusted hilt and the enter surface seemed to shimmer. It was then that the evil Rita had sensed fell up on them.
<P>
<P>A black Unicorn had emerged from the shadows, its hot breath hanging in the cool forest air as it began to circle around Rita and Ryo. Needless to say this was an eerie sight for anyone to see, most would have run away screaming for their lives, which suited this creatures taste just fine, but the way Ryo stood his ground was definitely something it didn't expect.
<P>
<P>"Aw look at the jackass... Well he shouldn't give us to much trouble."
<P>
<P>- Who are you calling a jackass puny mortal...- 
<P>
<P>"Oh and it can communicate too, well you keep that tone up and you'll end up as glue."
<P>
<P>Before Ryo could react he was charged and rammed through several trees, it was now apparent that this creature was determined to kill them, which didn't surprise either Ryo nor Rita in the least.  As Ryo began to stand up he received a strike to the face from the unicorns hoofs, which in turn sliced his cheek open and sent him tumbling across the ground, dazed.
<P>
<P>- Now that he's out of the way, its time to have fun with you Dark Elf. -
<P>
<P>- Nag your going to be sorry for that one.... -
<P>
<P>- Well this is a surprise, so there are two instead of one in that body, but its to late you can't stop me from fulfilling my dark master's wishes, which are to kill you and the others. -
<P>
<P>"Ryo, you can get up now and kill this thing."
<P>
<P>The beast lashed out at Rita, attempting to gorge her with its horn, instead thanks to Rita quick reflexes she parried its horn away.  This only proved to anger the beast and it struck her across the head with its hoofs, sending Rita to the ground unconscious and bleeding from a gash across her forehead. It was then that Ryo began to realize that if he didn't react soon that Rita would be trampled to death.
<P>
<P>"First you made the mistake of getting in my way... Then you made the mistake of drawing blood on my face... But your biggest mistake was hurting her..."
<P>
<P>Ryo stood up, wiping away the blood from the cut on his cheek, his eyes narrowed and seem to glow crimson.  In a full out rage Ryo rushed the beast, and before it could react he had wrapped his arms around its muzzle and was forcing it backwards.  Never before had this ever happened, the only person this creature knew that could be this strong was Mayong.  In a feeble attempt to escape from Ryo's grasp it raised into the air, this only gave Ryo the leverage he needed and in turn he flung the beast through several trees.
<P>
<P>- Impossible... The only persons with this kind of raw power are my master, and Mayong. -
<P>
<P>"Mayong is dead, has been since several days ago... An now its your turn to join him!"
<P>
<P>Ryo rushed forward and clamped his hands down on the unicorn's blackened horn, seconds later a sickening crushing sound and then the sound of gurgling of running blood was hear as Ryo torn the horn from the great beasts forehead, only to spin it around and ram the horn's point deep into the same spot it just came from.
<P>
<P>- Well now where did all that come from, looks like someone has some feelings after all. -
<P>
<P>- Oh shut up... -
<P>
<P>- Rita and Ryo sitting in a tree.... -
<P>
<P>Before Shoken could go on however Ryo gave a quick strike to the side of his head, which in turn stopped Shoken, and caused Ryo to wince slightly.
<P>
<P>- Ouch damn it that hurt you know. -
<P>
<P>- Well at least it shut you up. -
<P>
<P>Having made his point clear Ryo walked over to Rita and examined the wound for a second, it wasn't exactly life threatening, however it was unsightly to look at. After a simple shrug Ryo tore the arms of his shirt off and wrapped them around Rita's head, covering the wound as tight as he could without cutting off the circulation.
<P>
<P>- Well least you have that much sense. -
<P>
<P>- I thought I told you to shut up... -
<P>
<P>With that Ryo hoisted Rita up onto his shoulder and began to make his way towards the entrance to the Steamfont Mountains.  All the while he thought about what had just happened, was what he had felt the same thing that had caused Shoken to gain enough power to defeat Mayong.  Ryo continued to think as he neared the Steamfont mountains.
<P>
<P>Meanwhile Zolf and Azia had managed to slip into the Minotaur Caves located in the Steamfont Mountains.  It didn't take them long to come across several slaves who where being forced into tedious labor.
<P>
<P>"Zolf we can't just leave them here like this..."
<P>
<P>"I agree Azia, might as well do some good while we're here right?"
<P>
<P>"Of course."
<P>
<P>Azia rushed in and bashed the nearest minotaur slaver she could see in the snout with her shield, seconds later several of the other slavers where burnt to a crisp by one of Zolf's fire spells. Things where going great until the Minotaur Lord and Hero showed up.
<P>
<P>"Azia I hope you have something to handle these two!"
<P>
<P>"Oh quit cowering and just begin casting your spell."
<P>
<P>Crimson streams of mana began to surge up around Zolf's hands as Azia rushed the two Minotaurs, in one quick movement she had unsheathed the ancient weapon she had attained that very day and swung it at them.  A streaking wave of mana erupted from the blade, flinging the minotaurs down the cave passageway, giving Zolf the precious time he needed to complete his spell.
<P>
<P>"Inferno of Al'Kabor."
<P>
<P>Seconds later the two Minotaur where engulfed by flames and promptly burnt to a crisp just as the ones before had.  It was then that Meldrath reared his ugly gnomish head, the necromancer stared at the intruders for a moment.
<P>
<P>"What do ye want here?"
<P>
<P>"We're after the staff you stole from Felwithe"
<P>
<P>"Well you kinnae have it! I'm still tinkering with it!"
<P>
<P>At that Meldrath attacked by sending in his putrid skeletal servant which went directly for Azia. It was obvious the gnomish necromancer was use to dealing with intruders, but this time he was in for a shock.  Within just a few strikes of her sword the skeleton collapsed to the floor, inanimate once again.  All this time Zolf had been preparing a spell, this one he had managed to pick up in Felwithe during their short stay there.
<P>
<P>"Ice Comet!"
<P>
<P>A wave of chilling frost seemed to settle on everything and then the now defenseless necromancer was bombarded by a massive burst of freezing cold.  After this he simply fell to the ground, frozen as solid as a board. It didn't take long for Azia and Zolf to find the staff, it had been sitting out in the open, next to a tinkered device the gnome had been working on.  Once in Zolf's hands it began to irradiate with power, awesome power the likes which he had never known possible, which had a kind of intoxicating effect.
<P>
<P>"Its time to go Zolf."
<P>
<P>"Oh...... Yes lets go."
<P>
<P>Azia, along with Zolf, lead the now freed slaves to the gnomish guards at a set of windmills then quickly hurried down the path to the Lesser Faydark, in hopes that Ryo and Rita where already waiting.  Of course when they got there as to be expected a huge argument broke out.
<P>
<P>"Ryo what the hell happened to her!"
<P>
<P>"Really Azia I'm fine... It's just a little scratch."
<P>
<P>"Humph! No matter what me or Shoken do it can't seem to please you can it Azia? Be thankful I saved her at all, I could of just let that black unicorn trample her to death."
<P>
<P>"I'll deal with you when I get back to Felwithe..."
<P>
<P>"Whatever..."
<P>
<P>"Thank you Ryo..."
<P>
<P>Rita gave Ryo a small smile while Azia continued her fuming belittling of him as they began heading back to the Greater Faydark to meet up with the others.  Zolf could only imagine what powers the other staff held in store for Zinka.
<P>
<P>"Well that was pretty easy wasn't it dears?"
<P>
<P>"Well it was easier than I thought, we should get going though before we're caught by something."
<P>
<P>"All right lead on Daxster."
<P>
<P>The trio quickly left the Cauldron and hurried down the path, all the time Selena noticed how the area seemed devoid of any kind of life whatsoever, there wasn't even a goblin in sight, nor any basilisks.  Even as they entered the Greater Faydark there was no sound or feeling of life. Just as they met the others finally they heard a noise, it sent chills up everyone's spine, that is except for Ryo.
<P>
<P>"Boys you've meddled in my affairs for long enough!!!"
<P>
<P>"So your the bastard that sent all those things out here before, and I suppose your the one who commanded Mayong to attack this place as well as that monstrosity of a unicorn in the Lesser Faydark."
<P>
<P>"That's right, now hand over the weapons since you've so kindly collected them for me."
<P>
<P>- What's this jerks name anyway Ryo. -
<P>
<P>"Why Shoken, my name is Xernoss, it is fitting that you know the name of your destructor."
<P>
<P>It was then that everyone heard something they never thought possible, they heard both Ryo and Shoken speak at the same time, the same words.
<P>
<P>"Everyone, send word to evacuate the continent..."
<P>
<P>Shoken's personality surfaced and he rushed forward, lunging out with a fist at Xernoss, only to have it collide with Xernoss own fist and cause a shock wave of mana and energy to ripple through the area........
<P>
<P>The fight is on.... Who will win... Only time and chapter 9 will tell who the victor of this battle royal will be.  Read on dear fans, but be warned. Chapter 9 will not be pretty.
