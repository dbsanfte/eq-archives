  <tr><td class='db'>Perhaps the stories of war were just rumor.

Perhaps, perhaps not.  I spent over week in Qeynos, with no sign of an invasion or a coup.  After speaking with the officers for the High Council, I was released from my post, and allowed to do some more adventuring to increase my skills and better ready myself in case the war does come.  So, I sent word to Ravenflight (who had long since left and returned to High Keep), and met him that night on the road to Qeynos Hills.  There was a farmer on the shore in North Karana that Ravenflight thought I should speak with.  Apparently, he had information regarding the Plague and perhaps some insight into the possible Bertoxxulous invasion.  We searched, but the farmer was no where to be found.  However, we did come across a man named Ryshon Hunsti standing near the water.  We spoke for a while, and he revealed that he had some information on a noble sword that he was willing to give to me if I was willing to take the quest.  I wholeheartedly accepted the quest, and he handed me a message for a dwarf named Kanthuk Ogrebane and said I could find him near Kaladim.  I thanked him, and Ravenflight and I went on our way to High Keep.

I never got a chance to hunt here, since last time I was on my way the High Keep is when I got the message regarding the war, and one of my guildmates, Tammytree Litefoot, gave us a teleport to North Karana.  This time, however, the trip was considerably less eventful, and we finally made it to High Keep itself.  Ravenflight took me through the halls of the mountain keep, and led me to the bank where he bound my spirit, just in case.  We wasted no time joining a group of adventurers in the mines, and thus began to hunt the goblins.

Ravenflight warned me that it was dangerous here, but I thought that I had been fighting goblins since I first set out on my adventures.  I didn't figure that these would really be that much different.  Well.  I honestly can say that I couldn't have been more wrong.  In my first fight, I realized how strong these goblins were.  They hit much harder and faster than their cousins in Butcherblock, and their spellcasters had power I had never seen before in their race.  I knew I could never take one of these alone... luckily, I never had to.  We worked together well, and our own injuries were light, even though we went through many goblins that day.  I learned more about combat that day than I had learned in a week of fighting crocs in Oasis.  Plus the whole place was a set of mines!  Where better for a dwarf to hone his skills?  On a side note, I heard that the Runnyeye goblins have overthrown their old leader, King Xorbb, and have aligned themselves with the Pickclaw goblins, which is what we fought now.  I've heard that evil will always turn in on itself, so this news doesn't surprise me in the least.

It was on one of these goblins that I found a small scroll, with the name "Amstaf" inscribed on it.  I thought it was curious, and I tucked it away in a bag at my side.  It's significance wouldn't come to me until later, after I had spent some time in the mines, increasing my skills.  You see, Ravenflight left to go help another friend of ours, Wenjii (who I have found myself becoming more fond of.  She's a lovely young gnomish enchanter from Steamfront... but that's another story).  I very much wanted to go with him, but he left before we were able to meet up... humans are always in such a hurry.  In any case, I decided to venture out on my own and turn in the note to Kanthuk.  So, I made my way to Freeport to catch the boat to Faydwer.  Funny thing, I met Ravenflight and Wenjii at the gates to the city, and although I was very glad to see them, I had already made up my mind to return the note, so I bid them farewell and headed for the docks.

The boat ride was largely uneventful, and I found Kanthuk standing right outside the walls of the docks.  I gave him Ryshon's note, and with a smile, he asked me to sit with him while he told me a story.  It was a tale of him and a friend of his, a man by the name of Amstaf Trunolis.  As he related the story, it became apparent to me that Amstaf was a paladin, not unlike myself.  Kanthuk's story told of Amstaf's noble deeds, which in all honesty, could have been as much fantasy as fact (but I am inclined to believe it... Kanthuk is a dwarf, and a dwarf paladin at that).  At the end, Kanthuk said that he wasn't what ever became of Amstaf, and asked me to take a pendant to a lady named Llara near Unrest.  I bid him farwell, and since Unrest was not far from where I was, I made my way there.

I entered Dagnor's Cauldron, and began to search for Llara.  Once I found the entrance to the Estate of Unrest, I took a quick look around, but was unable to locate Llara.  I figured she must be inside the Estate itself, so I followed the tunnel there.  Once inside, I was nearly toppled over by the overwhelming sense of dread that hit me like a wave.  I had heard that the once beautiful Estate had been overrun by foul undead creatures, and as a young rockchopper I was told never to go there under any circumstances... and of course, I ignored all those warnings when I stepped through the gate.  Once inside, of course, I began to wish I hadn't.  The whole place was simply overrun by the things... animated scarecrows, gnarled ghouls, shambling skeletons, just to name a few.  I certainly didn't want to be here long, so I hailed the first worn adventurer I could find, who happened to be a druid in the form of a wolf.  I asked her if she know of Llara, or where she could be found.  Luckily, she did know of Llara, and was able to direct me to her.  However, she told me that I would need a towel and some climing gear to get to her... she was out in the lake, on top of a rock.  I imagine she had gone out there to meditate uninteruppted, which is something I wouldn't mind doing once in a while.  But for now, her isolation presented a problem for me.  I bade the druid farewell, and made my way back outside to try and figure a way to the stray rock in the middle of the water.

Again, fortune was with me.  No sooner than did I step into the sunloght outdoors, than did the very druid I was just speaking with appear next to me!  She said that she could help me, if my quest was noble.  I assured her that I belived it to be, and launched into a set of psalms and quotes outlining a dwarven paladin's devotion to the Light.  The druid seemed satisfied (after assuring me several times that she had gotten the point), and offered to cast a spell on me that would allow me to float on air across the water and to the rock.  Inside, I was a bit nervous about being off the nice, solid ground, but I had actually had this spell cast on me before, so I immediately agreed.  Next thing that I knew, I was lifted into the air on wings of magic, and was able to walk in the wind like it was a regular cobblestone street.  After a hearty thanks to the druid, I turned to make my way to Llara.

I walked up to her and landed on the rock nearby.  She ignored my approach and even my initial hail to her; I assume she was deep in her meditation.  I laid the pendant that Kanthuk gave to me near her feet, and her eyes suddenly flew open!  She grasped the necklace and demanded to know where I had gotten it.  I told her, and she seemed to soften.  Then she began to talk more about the man known as Amstaf, and had some interesting stories to tell.  I spoke with her at length, during which her trust in me seemed to grow.  After a time, she told me that to continue my quest, I would need to speak to a woman named Rauthey who lest Llara had heard was in the wastes of Lavastorm.  She gave me a note that I was to give to Rauthey and bid me godspeed.

When I got back to the shore, the druid I spoke to earlier was still there.  She greeted me as I approached, and immediately asked if I was on a quest for a Holy Sword.  I was a bit surprised that she had so simply figured out the goal of my quest.  I answered in the affirmative, but the surprise must have been evident in my voice.  She smiled and said that she had heard of the Noble Sword, and even had heard several rumors surronding it.  In fact, the reason she was in Unrest was because of that very sword!  She said that she had heard that a part of the quest, the heart of a ghoul, could be found here, and so she had come looking for it.  It was a good lead, and since I was here anyway, I thought I'd follow her in and see if I could find the heart myself.

I stayed by her side for a while, but it became clear that I was getting in the way and putting her life in danger.  Soon, I bid her good luck, and using the information she generously imparted on me, I went in search of the heart myself.  However, I soon found that the Ghouls were more than I could handle alone, and I decided that I should go find some help.  Ravenflight came to mind first, and walked down the path leading away from the Estate.

I didn't get too far before I happened upon an adventurer beset by skeletons and ghouls!  I jumped into the fray, swinging my axe and howling at the undead attackers.  Between the two of us, we felled all of our adversaries, and finally were able to greet each other.  During the meeting, it became evident that he never actually need my help, but appreciated it anyway... he was a paladin of quite high stature!  We also found that we were on the same quest; he searched for the ghoul heart as well!  We thought that the whole place would be safer if we paired up, so we made our way back up the haunted path.

We thought it might be best to hunt the foul creatures in the house itself, so we walked carefully around to the back doors.  As we entered, two of the ghouls we were looking for were directly to either side, but didn't notice us right off.  we made a plan to immediately jump on the one on our left, and try to destroy it as quickly as possible before it's kin could join the fray.  Each muttering a silent prayer, we lept through the doors and started swinging at the creature.  We caught it by surprise, and we able to dispatch it quickly because of this.  The other ghoul didn't even seem to notice us at first, and thus it found itself also fighting the two of us alone.

After defeating the evil pair, we decided to lie in waiting for others of their ilk.  Certainly, a place as infested with the undead as this would provide us with no shortage of foes to vanquish.  Indeed, we found ourselves battling ghoul after ghoul that night, and we became friends while doing it.  The Light was with us there, and after long hours of slaying the foul ghouls, we were rewarded with not one, but two intact Hearts!  After rejoycing together, we went our seperate ways to continue our quest for the weapon.

I still had the note to Rauthey, and thus decided to seek her out in Lavastorm.  I was lucky, because none other than my friends Ravenflight, Talai, and the lovely Wenjii all came with me!  We had to go through the Teir'Dal controlled Nektulos Forest, and avoid the guards there in.  It was definately risky, but Wenjii was able to make us invisible to their watchful eyes, and Ravenflight could make us faster than they could hope to run.  We made it through the forest unharmed, and came to the pits of Lavastorm.  As soon as we passed through the valley into the mountains, I spied none other than Rauthey herself on top on a rock nearby!  I handed her the note, which she read.  She seemed to trust me after that, and following a brief conversation, she handed me a magic back to hold the pieces of the Holy Sword within.  I thanked her, and turned to leave.  Before I could go, however, Rauthey told me that part of the sword might be found nearby, in the dungeon of Najena!  I thanked her once more, and off I went.

I left for the dungeon, and found it in short order.  I had heard of this place before... it is supposedly under the control of an evil Teir'Dal necromancer also named Najena.  I had also heard that she doesn't much like intruders, and had the whole of her domain guarded by ogres and all manner of undead.  </td></tr>
