<p>Soulfire Quest<br>
<br>
This document gives all the info needed to get the Paladin Soulfire sword. This
is the quickest and easiest way to get it, and this skips a lot of unnecessary
quest steps that you would otherwise have to suffer through.<br>
<br>
1) Buy a cloth shirt from a vendor in Freeport. It cannot be a small one. Head
out to East Commonlands and find Altunic Jartin in or near a hut across from the
third Inn. Give him the cloth shirt and he will give you a token of generosity.
While out there, buy a spider venom sac from a vendor or kill a desert tarantula
in North Ro and loot one.<br>
<br>
2) Go to the Hall of Truth in Freeport and find Merkos Quentos, who is in the
backyard outside. Give him the spider venom sac. He will give you a token of
bravery.<br>
<br>
3) Give Merkos both the token of generosity and the token of bravery. He will
tell you your final opponent awaits you in the sewer. Jump down in the water,
and right inside the tunnel you will see Guard Willia. DO NOT WASTE TIME!
Quickly run up to her and kill her. She is about level 12. If you wait too long
or miss her too much, she runs down the tunnel and zones and you will have to
start all over at the first step. Loot her corpse and get the token of truth.<br>
<br>
4) Give the token of truth to Merkos and receive your Testimony of Truth - the
first of the four components needed to receive your soulfire.<br>
<br>
5) Go to the Seafarer's Roost in East Freeport - the bar past the dock. Sometime
during the night only (happened around 5am game time for me) Tykar Renlin will
spawn on the side of the bar. He has the same character model as a Madman from
North Ro. Give him 4 Drom's Champagnes, one at a time - they can be purchased
right at the bar, and can only be purchased one at a time since they are LORE.
Do this quickly, as he will despawn after a short while. Have the first one on
your cursor ready to give him as soon as he spawns. You will receive a blanket
after giving him the 4th Drom's Champagne.<br>
<br>
6) Go out into the newbie area outside of the East Gate and kill trash to get
several fire beetle's eyes, rat's ears, and snake scales. You need to make
edible goo (cooking) and bog juice (brewery). Go to Trader's Holiday in East
Freeport - they have an oven and a still. You do not need skills in cooking and
brewery to make this work - but if you do it may be easier. I made edible goo
the first try, it took me three tries to make bog juice - and I had NO skills in
either of these trades.<br>
<br>
Edible Goo recipe: Put one fire beetle eye and one rat ear in the oven and click
combine.<br>
<br>
Bog juice recipe: Buy a bottle from the bar. Put one water flask, one bottle,
and one snake scale in the still and press combine.<br>
<br>
7) Go find Zimel in the jail cells under the Arena. He is locked in the first
cell and mutters gibberish occasionally. His name does not appear above his
character.<br>
<br>
8) Give him the blanket first. Next, give him BOTH the edible goo and the bog
juice at the same time. Zimel will give you a key marked H.K. 102.<br>
<br>
9) Go to the bank in Highhold Pass. Hand the female bank clerk the key. She
gives you a note to deliver to Brother Hayle in Splitpaw.<br>
<br>
10) Time to do faction building! It is very important to build up the necessary
faction to the Priests of Life first, which is Brother Hayle's faction. Go to
Qeynos, head to the bank in South Qeynos and get about 1600 in GOLD pieces. Go
back into North Qeynos, and head to the vicinity of the Temple of Life, near the
caster's UFO looking teleport to their respective guilds. Roaming around you
will find Nashun Novashine. He may be outside the city gates or in front of the
Monk guild as well. Hail him and start giving him 2 gp at a time. When you first
con him you will be either apprehensively (I was) or indifferent. It took me
about 2 hours and nearly 1600 gp total, 2 at a time to get him to con me as
WARMLY - where it needs to be. The order is: scowls, threateningly, dubious,
apprehensively, indifferent, amiably, kindly, and finally warmly. Stop after
every 10 or so gives to hail him to prevent him from walking off. By the way, he
gives you a light heal each time, and it SAYS you gain exp (It did to me at lvl
32 anyway). But I noticed no difference on my xp bar after the entire ordeal. If
he cons warmly, so will Brother Hayle in Splitpaw. Warmly may be overkill, and I
have heard that kindly is good enough, but no sense in risking it. And if you
decide to do the Aegis of Life quest someday you will need high warmly Priests
of Life faction anyways.<br>
<br>
11) Note: This part can be skipped and done along with step 14 if you wish -
however doing it now will not cause you to make the mistake of handing in the
wrong note when the time comes to get your Soulfire. Off to Splitpaw (no, you
aren't getting Soulfire this trip….) Recommend taking a wizard or druid with
you who can cast See Invisible on both of you and then Invisibility on both of
you after zoning into Splitpaw. Go to the jail. Open the outer door of the jail
by clicking on the wall switch on the right side of the door. Once inside and
the door closes, you are safe from NPC's attacking. Hayle is in the last cell.
The switch to open his cell is on the right side in the middle of the jail.
Uninvis yourself by casting a spell - you cannot trade to Hayle while invisible
due to the fact that he will con you indifferent. Once he can see you, you will
con warmly if you did the faction raising in the last step. Have your partner
STAY OUTSIDE Hayle's cell or you will both get locked in!! (Not a problem if
your partner can TP you out) He can open the switch for you when you are done.
Give Hayle the note given to you by the bank teller. He will hand you back
another note. You now have the second component needed to get the Soulfire. You
will be returning to Hayle at the end - he is the one who gives you the fine
weapon. Either invis and run out or if you have a wiz or druid, TP out.<br>
<br>
12) Now the tough part. You need two tough kills. The first is Sir Lucan in the
militia house in Freeport. Get a lot of high level friends to help you kill him.
When he dies, his ghost spawns and you must kill it too. Loot the undead
version's corpse, and you will get Lucan's testimony. Take it to Valeron Dushire
in the Hall of Truth and you receive the Brilliant Sword of Faith - the third
component needed for Soulfire.<br>
<br>
13) The last kill is a Shadowknight Troll in Castle Mistmoore named Xicotl.
Again, gather your high level friends. He spawns in the bath room just past the
gargoyle room to the left through the fake wall when entering through the jail.
His PH is a Mistmoore Guard. Kill him and receive the Glowing Hilt from looting
his corpse.<br>
<br>
14) Travel one last time to Splitpaw to visit Brother Hayle. Be sure to cast a
spell to drop your invisibility first once safely inside the jail! Hand him the
four components together:<br>
<br>
1) The note Hayle gave you back<br>
2) Your Testimony of Truth<br>
3) The Brilliant Sword of Faith<br>
4) The Glowing Hilt<br>
<br>
Congratulations on receiving your Soulfire!!<br></td>
