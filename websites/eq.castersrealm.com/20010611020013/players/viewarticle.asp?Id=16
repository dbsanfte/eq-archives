In the Beginning<br>
------------------------ <br>
The blood rain had long since passed when was Arorua woken up
that morning. She
grumbled and cursed the skeleton servants that were repairing the
barrier over looking
the training grounds. They paid her no attention and worked
steadily, ignoring the hail of
grumbles, insults and occasional pillow. Eventually out of
pillows, she put on her robes
and left the quarters to find Raziel. 
Raziel floated above the training grounds, observing the newest
ranks of knights
practicing newfound skills against skeletal servants and undead
rats. He made note of
ones that seemed to have promise to become Hell Knights. Raziel
saw one that had much
promise, and decided to give him a test. He whispered a quick
incantation to the amulet
around his neck. </p>

<p>&quot;Acto serva, liber famiala&quot; </p>

<p>The amulet glowed briefly, and a raven landed on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>&quot; Reyas, take form and attack&quot; * </p>

<p>The raven cawed and leapt down toward the young knight. The
raven swooped past her
and changed its shape into a skeleton. The knight turned just in
time just in time to
dodge the attack of the skeleton. The knight easily parried the
skeleton's blows, and
executed a flip away from the skeleton. Quickly reassessing the
skeletons attacks; she
whirled away from the onslaught of fists. Seeing an opening, she
shattered the arms of
the skeleton. Then ran her blade through the mid-section of the
skeleton. The skeleton
howled and crumbled. The bone fragments then flew back together,
and retook the form
of a raven. * </p>

<p>&quot;Well done young one. Not many can best Reyas. Report to
my quarters in the morning.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, M'lord Raziel&quot; </p>

<p>Then to the raven &quot;Reyas return!&quot; The raven cawed
and flew back to the amulet. </p>

<p>&quot;Is this how you have fun? Using your familiar to beat up
the new ones?&quot; said Arorua
jestingly 
&quot;Of course, what other way is there?&quot; Raziel said with
a laugh </p>

<p>&quot;I wonder... Help me up?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Always&quot; He weaned a quick spell and lifted Arorua
up to him. &quot;Did Malik do the same toyou, when you were
training?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No. Malik made me a Hell Knight as soon as I was old
enough. He saw something in me
when I was young.... I guess he was right.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I guess so. How did Malik meet you? I thought you were
born in Erudin or was that
another part of your deception to get into Felwithe?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; I was, but it's a long story Ar&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We have all the time in the world.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; Alright. But don't say I didn't warn you.&quot; <br>
----------------------------------------- <br>
&quot;My mother was cleric, she served my people during the
second Holy War against Erudin.
She was captured at the end of war and was imprisoned underneath
the city. I do not know what happened to her, during her time underneath Erudin, but
I can guess. The
most apparent was giving birth to me. But that didn't relax her
imprisonment any. She<br>
stayed inside for almost 5 years after my birth, but eventually
she got redemption&quot; <br>
------------------------------------- <br>
Leylia was tired; the years of malnutrition had paid a heavy toll
on her. At least Raziel
was strong, but pained her to see him, stuck in this god-forsaken
place. She had to get
out, she had to get Raziel home..to..to his family..to her
mate...she missed him dearly..he
was so strong...she missed him..he was so.. She dosed off for a
while, but was woken up
as the door opened. Three people stood before her, two men
obviously guards and a
woman from her robes; she looked like a Templar. </p>

<p>&quot;He is quite strong, amazing that they survived so long,
you should have taken the boy
out of here long ago. It will make it harder to convert him from
that filth that she has
probably been spouting to him&quot; </p>

<p>No...they couldnt..not Raiz....they were going..to ......her
body ached so much...this was
her only chance....*... </p>

<p>&quot;May Cazic Thule..... protect us&quot; she said weakly </p>

<p>Before the guards could react, she leapt up kicking on guard
in the groin and then she<br>
blinded the other. The Templar began to draw her sword; Leylia
rushed to her planting her fist into the Templar's sternum. Using
the moment's distraction Leylia whipped out the Templar's blade
and separated the Templar's head from her body. Blood sprayed
over the cell, not wasting any time, Leylia dropped the blade and
removed the Templar's ceremonial dagger and scooped up Raziel. </p>

<p>Only a few minutes had passed since her break out, running as
fast as she could, she could see the Teleporter to the Toxxulia
gate. Raziel, despite her efforts was crying loudly. She
desperately tried to quiet him, to no avail. Then she heard a
crackling, but she kept running*. Then her body ignited as a bolt
of flame slammed into her. She stumbled and fell onto the
teleporter. She blanked out momentarily as her body shifted to
the Toxxulia gate, as soon as she felt herself come back together
she began to run, although her sight had not returned yet. </p>

<p>She poured through the twisting hallway, and then she felt the
fresh air coming through the tunnel. She was free; she had made
it to Toxxulia forest. But she could not stop yet. She bowled
right into one of the guards out side, knocking him over and then
blinded the other. She continued on. Raziel was bawling loudly,
the rags covering them both were soaked with his tears. </p>

<p>She ran and ran into the forest, working off old memories,
trying desperately to find home. Then as if Cazic Thule had
blessed them, she saw the Ivory Bridge; it towered into the sky,
dwarfing the river. She was almost home, she could finally see
her mate, she could show him his son, she missed her dear ....
Her world went blank as a bolt of energy struck her; she tumbled,
spilling Raziel on to the hard surface of the bridge. </p>

<p>Raziel crawled over to her shaking her. She stirred a little.
&quot;My Raziel......please run....go home........ take this
dagger... go.. go to your father.. go to..m.&quot; Her body
lifted off the bridge, struck by another bolt of energy, and fell
into the river. </p>

<p>&quot;Good another follower dead, the heretics are falling
like flies.&quot; Laughed a Templar </p>

<p>Turning to Raziel, holding out his hand &quot;Come child, this
forest is no place for you, we must teach the ways of Marr, so
you too can strike down the Heretics.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel turned away and ran. </p>

<p>&quot;Poor child, we were to late from protecting him from
Cazic Thules touch.&quot; the Templar<br>
headed back toward Erudin. </p>

<p>Raziel dashed through the forest, stumbling and falling all
the way. He wandered for almost 2 days, and then he saw a
campfire. So tired, he wandered into the camp. And sat down near
the fire. He heard a bark and the ground rustle he turned around
to face a Kobold towering over him. He screamed and went to run
away, but the kobold ran his claws across Raziel's back. Raziel
rolled on the ground, scrambling to get away, but the kobold
closed in. It brought it's claws to strike again, the paw flew
from the kobold's arm as Raziel wielded the ceremonial dagger.
The Kobold howled in pain and charged Raziel. Blood sprayed
across Raziel's face as the dagger entered its skull. The body
slumped to the ground, and Raziel stood in shock as the blood
rolled down him. </p>

<p>&quot;Grr..bark!.. you will die ..eruudite... growl..
bark!&quot; called out 2 more kobolds that
appeared behind Raziel. Raziel faced them, still in shock. They
closed in and then a shadow whisked over the Kobolds. They
halted, their facial expression showing pain and surprise. They
collapsed on to the ground, blood spilling from them. </p>

<p>&quot;You are quite lucky little one,&quot; said a tall figure
appearing behind the two bodies. The figure moved forward some,
noting the Kobold killed by Raziel &quot;and skilled, some of my
pupils cant best a Kobold in full armor, and lo, a small child
killed one with a dagger not fit for cutting bread!' he laughed
loudly. Raziel passed out. <br>
