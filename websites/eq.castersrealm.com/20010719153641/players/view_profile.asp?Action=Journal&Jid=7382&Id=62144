  <tr><td class='db'><p>When last I made an entry, I'd just docked within <i>The Overthere</i>.  Much has happened since then, but I get ahead of myself. The great ship <i>The Bloated Belly</i>, a marvel of charred timbers and juxtaposing beams, had finally docked.  The sight I beheld was like none other I'd seen.  Great walls of stone surrounded the encampment, and the ruins within were inhabited by a variety of such I'd never encountered.  There were Ogres, Trolls, and Dark Elves milling about, and they were beings of such power!  And then there were the guardians of the fort; Undead Soldiers aplenty and gargoyles were about.  And then there was this monstrously huge beast which I believe they call the <i>Goelm</i>; a beast that looked much in appearance like the muddites in the <i>Gorge of King Xorbb</i> only on a MUCH larger scale.  The bankers and most of the merchants of this great encampment were none other than <i>tinkered gnome clockworks</i> of all things!  Ah the surprises were non-ending in this great land.</p><p>  It was then that I came across one who knew of this place called <i>Kurn's Tower</i>.  He told me that it lay far to the east and with his assistance I was able to make a crude map of sorts.  The beasts of this regin were far too powerful for me, so if I had any hopes of advancing my skills I was to venture to a place called <i>The Field of Bone</i>.  It's herein the <i>Kurn's Tower</i> lies.</p><p>I packed as many provisions as I could carry, and scribed to my mind those spells of which I might be in great need of, for one never knows what's to be encountered in such regions.  Taking a deep breath and cloaking myself in shadows I set off to find my way to the <i><b>Kurn's Tower</b></i>.</p><p> The land outside of the encampment was vast.  One could see many creatures dwadling about in the distance.  I spotted a Rhinocerous of a sort; it's size not easily determined nor its distance because this land lacked in any kind of markers other than scattered shrubs.  I also laid eyes upon a curious bird of some sort; a cocatrice I believe they called it.  What a curious creature with features resembling a rooster, yet a lizard-like tail.  Very odd indeed.  I know there were other monsters and beasts to be found in this region, but traveling along the northern shore I thankfully didn't encounter many.  I followed this shore until I came upon an impassible mountain, and followed its base south until I came upon the valley entrance to the area known as <i><b>Warslike Woods</i></b>.  Peering into this valley, it became quite apparent why it is called such.</p><p>Before entering into this wooded region, i stopped to rest my legs a bit.  Although at this point I'd traveled aplenty, I still had to massage out the soreness in these "travel-legs".  Consulting the map, and munching on a ration, I discovered that once I passed into these woods that I needed to make haste to the north once more and follow the shore to the east.  Heaving a sigh of reluctance and stretching my taunt and tired muscles I once again cloaked myself in shadows, setting forth once more.</p><p>The woods were dark and damp.  Visiblity not much beyond the next tree.  Thank Innoruuk for my cloak of shadows for I nearly ran head-on into a Woodlan Giant of some sort!  What the natives call him escapes me, but one thing that doesn't is this beast looked none too friendly.  Skirting my way around him I continued my northern trek relying heavily on my developed skill to sense my heading.  The hillside stopped abruptly at the northern shore, and I sighed in relief at the greater visiblity...for no one likes exploring blindly.  Refreshing my cloak of shadows, I followed the rough and rocky shore to the east.  Before long I came upon the river that I needed to cross.  I'd been forewarned not to travel too far inland up this river to search for a better crossing, but to just jump in and swim like mad.  The river was wide, deep and swift.  I could feel the currents pulling at my ankles when I stepped into its murky depths.  The chill of the waters was much more than I'd expected, for I was planning to slough off my clothing to swim this expanse.  However, knowing that my swimmin isn't as great as it should be, I knew that the chances of being chilled to the bone by the time I reached the other shore was great.  I decided to keep my clothing on me, whatever little protection against this cold water would be better than none.  Besides, the cool dampness of my garments may be refreshing and invigorating in these last legs of my hike.  I plunged into the great river, the cold quickening me.  I focused on the opposite shore, willing myself to be there, and within a few seconds I gained my rhythm.  Taking long strokes I made my way to that elusive shore.  About halfway across a numbness had creeped in, and although I knew I should be wary of it, I relished this new sensation. <i>Is this the numbness I will feel when I finally depart this world of the living?  Is this how the sweet caress of Death would feel?</i>  Lost in my own thoughts, my hand hit the sandy bottom of the opposite shore.  I reluctantly climbed out of the river and wrung as much water as I could out of my clothing and hair.  It was then I caught sight of my hands.  The cold of the water had lent a new interesting depth and shade to my complection.  Already the shade of the deepest ocean; the color of the sky as the light makes its first tentative appearance on the horizon; now had a curious purple undertone. <i>I'm a walking grape!</i> I chuckled at this thought and checked my bags for signs of water damage.  Satisfied that nothing was beyond repair, I set out once more.</p><p> It was then that I got my first look at an <i>Iksar</i>.  He was on the shore ahead of me a bit and couldn't see me due to my shadows.  He (and I'm assuming it was a he) appeared to be a bit taller than me and much more muscular.  He was covered from head to toe with what appeared to be scales; the same of which you would find on any reptile.  His overall color appeared to be various shades of tan and brown, and he stood upright like a humanoid.  When he turned I noticed that he had a long muscular tail nearly as long as his legs, which in itself looked deadly.  Upon his head I counted a total of six horns, three to each side of the head, about 3 to 4 inches long.  His face was definately reptilian and his mouth filled with razorsharp teeth.  I could <i>feel</i> the destructive potential and power emenating from him, and I shuddered not with fright.  Knowing not how long my shadows would cloak me I set forth once more, steeling one more glance over my shoulder as I passed him by.</p></td></tr>
