--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        I remember a time, a time not so long ago, when our land, my land, was a glorious refuge of peace and solice. It was a time of joy and wonderment, and a time to be remembered

        Walking through the Greater Faydark, I felt overwhelmed by the shear beauty and awe of this gigantic forest. The trees stretched beyond sight into the sky above, and the soil, so rich with nutrients that life sprang fourth from almost every field. The trees themselves provided shade and filtered the sunlight to provide almost the perfect growing conditions for the many farms that scattered the Greater Faydark. I walked by the Nightmoons farm, and breathed in the smell of fresh wheat. Wheat harvest is near, and soon I would be sent to purchase some wheat for Ma's baking. Gineve Nightmoon was outside as I walked by. She smiled and waved to me. Gineve was only 1 year my junior and had great skill in nurturing the soil to produce the best quality wheat in the Faydark. Her father was one of the greatest farmers in Kethlin. They say he can make seed grow in a scratch of soil and a drop of water. It is obvious that Gineve has learned much from him, and surely has his talent. I smiled and waved back, as her farther appeared in the doorway and said something I could not make out. Gineve smiled again and disappeared inside the house. As she shut the door behind her, I turned my attention across the road to my own home. My father was out in the field, and I could see him carefully adjusting an irrigation trough so the flow was just right. I jumped the fence and walked out into the field to join him.

        I reached down and scooped up a handfull of earth. As it run through my fingers I could smell, and feel the texture of it, and I knew that the planting season was almost upon us. My father had taught me since my fourth year how to read the soil. It was one of his many teachings in the way of the earth. It was very important to my father that I continue the traditions of learning how to harness nature in all her glory and revel in it. It was his belief that we should protect all things earthly, and care for them as long as we live. My father even taught me how to listen to the trees. How to hear their song, and to hear thier cries. Listening to the trees is a skill long forgotten with my people. It is said that our ancestors were able to do more then just listen to the trees, but those stories are for children's bed times. I am now in my 18th year, and not a child any longer.

        Father was a large elf. So many times he was mistaken for a High Elf as opposed to a Wood Elf. He stood almost six foot, and at least a head taller then I. He is very strong too. I have seen him lift a fallen tree alone, and carry it away. I have been told that I carry the same genes for strength, but I have never been able to lift a tree. "Father, the soil is almost ready for planting. I can smell the O'peil.". The O'peil is an old saying. I have been told it translates to mean, the ripening, but from what I can tell, it means the soil is ready to give life. "Aye, Phrido. It is almost time, me thinks perhaps another day or two then we will be ready to plant the crop", father said. "Have you done all of your chores?". "Yes father. Ma sent me over to see the merchants and pick up some milk. I had to pay 2 coppers today, they have raised the price somewhat." "Now Phrido, you wouldna be keeping the copper for yourself would you. I know how you like buy Gineve a bon bon or two." "Honestly father, the Windwillow farm is not producing enough milk this late in the season, at least so I was told." I said. "Aye. I have heard as well. Well then, we must be sure to get that milk inside afore it goes bad then. Wouldna want to waste it at that price." With that father started toward the house, and I followed with the milk.

        Ma was inside cooking dinner. The smells of fresh bread, snow peas, carrots, vine root, and spices floated through the air. My stomach immediately reminded me that I hadn't eaten since this morning. Father appeared back in the kitchen with a goblet of elven wine in his hand, and sat heavily into the leaf cushion chair at the far end of the kitchen. The sun was starting to set, and the last rays broke through the trees and filtered through the window near where father was sitting. Father enjoyed watching the sunset everynight from his chair. He often told me he could hear the sun as it touched the horizon and disappeared out of sight. Father was very educated in the old ways. His father was one of the last great druids of Kethlin. The skill of being a druid used to be passed down from father to son for as long as anyone could remember, but throughout the ages, other Wood Elves have decided to leave the path of Tunare and discover new skills within themselves. Stories and legends say that once the Wood Elves were among the greatest travellers and healers of the ages. The druids of legend could harness the power of Tunare and channel that power to perform feats beyond belief. Some legends speak of some powerful druids able to abandon our elf bodies all together and become one with Tunare in spirit. Great legends speak of druids able to use ceremonial stones to travel great distances in a blink of an eye, or of a druid able to harness the power of the sun and stars into a deadly force that would lay waste to anything caught in its path. Even if true though, these skills elude my people now. Now Wood elves have learned smithin, fletching, jewel craft, and tailoring. Many elves are now great story tellers and bards. They travel to the High Elf city of Felwithe and some even further. They bring stories to other cities and return here with fancy tales of thier adventures. I imagine that they have travelled far, but thier tales can hardly be believed. They sing of dwarves, gnomes, and a people called humans, but no one from Kethlin has ever seen any such people. One bard even quietly whispered tales to those who would listen about a far distant elf cousin, with dark skin, who would destroy Tunare if given the chance. I find these tales fanciful at best, and a story to frighten children at worst.

        My stomach growled and I returned my attention to the coming dinner. "Smells delicious Ma." I said. "You take a seat young'un, I'll not have you in my way until it is done." Father shifted in his chair across the room. He had taken out a Fummelo, and brought flame to it from the lamp on the table. The sweet smell of cherry wood filled the room as the smoke rose from the fummelo. Father brought it to his lips and puffed it a bit, appearing to savor the taste. "Phrido. Listen! Can you hear it. The trees are singing tonight." I turned my head a bit towards the window and concentrated on the sounds. I could not hear the trees at all. I could hear Ma stirring the boil, I could hear the flames in the hearth of the oven crackling and poping, I could even hear father puffing on the fummelo. I sighed, and shook my head. "No father, I can not hear them." I have never been able to hear the trees singing like father said. He taught me how to listen, he taught me how to concentrate, and he even taught me what to listen for, but I have never been able to hear them. "Francito Lays, you stop that nonsense now. The trees have not sang in hundreds of years. The talent has been lost. Only you claim to be able to hear them, why tease Phrido about it, when you know he can not" Ma said. Father let out a sniff, and turned back to the window. The corners of his mouth turned up in a small grin. He did hear something, that I am sure of.

        Dinner was a quiet time. A time where we gave thanks to Tunare for providing us with this incredible bounty before us. As I cleared off my plate and carried it to the wash stand in the kitchen, I overheard father telling Ma, that he wanted to take me to the cermonial stones soon. It is custom among the elves of Kethlin to go to the ceremonial stones during thier 18th year, in order to choose a path in life. It is our destiny to learn what our elders can teach us, but then we must make a choice of which path to follow and prepare to leave on our 19th year. Many elves have stayed in Kethlin and continued to be farmers. Others have decided to journey to Felwithe to explore new peoples and find thier calling there with our elven cousins. Still more decide to travel even further. I have heard tales of friends who have left to sail the oceans, in hopes of finding distant lands. Still others travel to the Steamfont mountains in hopes of finding the legendary city of the Gnomes. Although this is a fanciful tale, and many do not believe the fabled city exists, yet even more follow the road west in hopes of finding their way to the dwarven mines rumored to be near the cost, in a great city called Kaladim. I believe that neither of these places exist. And the elves who leave to find these places are to afraid to come back and speak of thier failures. Gineve's brother left not 2 years ago, to sail the oceans. He had told me of a great land far to the west, and he was sure to find it, and bring back news of the things he saw. He has been gone 2 years this season, and still no word. Although no one has said it outright, many believe that he has passed on to a higher life, and now shares his home with Tunare. I have no such fancies. I have decided my path is here, in Kethlin, with a farm of mine own. I just last week completed my wedding gift for Gineve, with plans to ask for her hand after the wheat harvest. She will make a fine wife, and bear me many sons. It is a simple life I yearn for, but Kethlin is my home, and home is where I choose to stay.

        Father and I cleaned up the dinner preparations then made our way outside to porch. We sat down and awaited the quiet of night to descend upon us. Every other night this season, father and I have retired to the porch, where he would continue my lessons in the old ways. Tonight was no different. "Phrido, listen carefully. Can you hear the trees? They are singing beautifully this eve." I closed my eyes, and cleared all thoughts from my mind. Father had taught me this technique for best being open to hearing the trees. I concentrated on nothing. I concentrated on the silence. I tried desperately to hear the song but could not. "Focus your thoughts Phrido, try to feel the trees through the air" he whispered quietly into the night. I listened to the wind rustling the leaves, I listened to the chirper bug that quietly sang it's song not to far away. I even listened to father sitting quietly, breathing deeply in the night air. Again, I could not hear the song. I tried once more to empty my thoughts, but a light breeze carried the smell of the wheat from the Nightmoon farm, and suddenly I was thinking of Gineve. I wondered how she would react when I asked for her hand, although, I think she expects it. Her and I have been together since I can ever remember. We grew together, played together, learned to farm together, and stole our first kisses together. I could picture her in my mind now. Standing at the gate to her house. Wearing her green body cover, with a light brown tunic pulled over top. Her black pants, fitting snugly to her hips, with a vine chinch cord tied around the top. Not that the fabric needed support. I think she purposely wore the tighter fitting pants around me, to show off her muscle tone, and fine figure. Her leather boots pulled to her calf was what all the girls were wearing these days, although Gineve explains that they are very comfortable, and that she is not just following fashion. She wears the one bracelet I gave her on her 16th year. I remember spending most of that year carving just the perfect bone bracelet for her. It is written in legend that a bone bracelet will bring wisdom to the wearer, and a sign of good fortune. Gineve loved it, and wears it all the time. I could clearly see her standing there, smiling at me in my mind. I felt very warm, and happy. I was not even thinking of anything, just admiring her beauty, and the happiness building inside me. I could picture her opening her mouth to say something to me, when she started singing. It was the most beautifull song I had ever heard. The notes were so light and airy, yet powerful and moving. I could feel the music in her voice, the vibrations, the rhythm. Suddenly I realized, that I did actually hear the music. It was not just in my mind. I opened my eyes and looked around, but I could not see anyone except for father sitting beside me. His eyes were closed, and the smile on his face told me, that he too heard the same music. "I hear it father....I hear it!" "Aye Phrido. I knew that you would. It is within your soul, you are a child of Tunare." The music grew softer, and seemed to grow distant. Part of me cried out for more. Yet I felt strangely at peace. I felt the grass under my feet, I could feel the grass across the yard. The trees outside the gate appeared to be breathing, as if they had lungs. The soil was more aromatic then ever. I could smell the O'Peil as if I had the soil under my nose at this very moment. The forest seemed more alive then ever before, and so did I. I let the feelings wash over me, and marveled in the sensations, and felt refreshed, and at one with the forest. It was then that I knew what it meant to be one with nature. It was then that I knew that my destiny was to be one with Tunare and protect her through all my days. It was then that I finally understood what father had been teaching me all these years. The song of the trees started to fade, and father stood to go inside. "Even Tunare must sleep son, but the song has been sung and tomorrow we will prepare to plant the crop. Get some sleep, tomorrow will be a busy day." "Aye father, I imagine it will. Father....I heard it....I really did, and I understand now. Tunare needs us as much as we need her, and when we go to the ceremonial stones, that is the path I will choose." I said. Father nodded his head, and gave me a quick grin, then pushed through the door and disappeared inside the house. I took one last look into the forest, which seemed even more grandiose then it ever had to me before. Breathing deeply in the night air, I turned and headed upstairs to bed.
