</FONT><HR>I played a High Elf enchanter on Bristlebane for four months (time played was 37 days).  Wasn't fun.  Switched to a cleric in late November.  Like a whole 'nother game.  Since then, I've discouraged people from starting enchanters, and I'd like to share with you why. I keep some very good records when I play, so I've got some supporting numbers to my comments (contained below).<P>To me, the over-arching problem with the enchanter class is that they are not viable in groups until Clarity at 29.  From levels 12 through 21, I wandered zones like a nomad in search of a group for weeks at a time.  I'd often get on at 9:00 p.m.and wander zones for an hour or two sending direct tells, doing /ooc statements and shouts looking for a group.  Most nights I never got a response.  Actually, almost every night I never got a response.  Eventually, I'd get trained and die or try to solo a high blue (simply because I found something that I might be able to kill for experience) and die.  Bristlebane is an old server and a popular one.  There are many tanks with crafted armor at level 5.  They don't need an enchanter until it's time for Guk.  There are a ton of Necros on Bristlebane.  Most get groups whenever they want.  Crowd control is just not an issue when the server has three times the number of players on them compared to what they were designed for.  Debuffs?  The MoB doesn't live long enough for debuffs or weak enchanter DoTs to matter, and everybody knows this.  I remember one guy shouting back, after my fifth shout for a group in one hour in South Karana; he said, "You'd get a group if Enchanters helped create more MoB crowds and not just control them."  Of course he was joking, but the point is that when there are bitter kill stealing fights all over, what is the point of an enchanter until the higher levels? <P>Now, I've got a lot of numbers here on my resistance rates.  I'm going to spare you the details and simply give you the totals:  From level 14 through level 21, I was resisted 42% of the time.  Imagine how much mana that is.  Imagine how many taunts that is.  Imagine how many times I died from that.  My intelligence was high.  My charisma was high.  I used Tashan and then the 20th level version when I got it.  I rarely casted on yellows or higher.  But the resistance made every spell cast a gamble.  Of course, as part of that need to keep my intelligence and charisma high, I sacraficed AC, like any caster would.  But the enchanter's hit points are low.  The stamina is low.  A few blows, and I'm dead.  What's going to help me, that weak pet?  <P>When you look at an enchanter's spell list, it is impressive, but much of the spells are useless.  As for the decent ones, well, when I've got to stack Tashan, Disempower, Languid Pace, Enfeeblement, a DoT and maybe something in the color line so that my pet with Quickness, Strengthen, Mist, and Rune One on him can maybe take down a low blue Orc, with my tanking for the pet as well with the same buffs on me, is this really viable?  I med for three minutes to get my mana up to do another Orc or Aviak and just hope to goodness that Languid Pace or Choke isn't resisted.  And the duration on my buffs got shorter twice as I played.  Again, I have numbers on this, but I won't bore you with the details.  I play with a stop watch, I know they did.  That's even more mana gone.<P>I'm not questioning the ability of enchanters once they hit level 29.  They eventually become a rival to a Necro as the two classes rise in levels.  What I'm saying is that the class needs a little help between levels 9 and 28.  Here are my suggetsions:<P>1.  Enchanters need a really nice spell to get them into groups earlier than level 29.  Quickness at 16 is OK, but the duration is very short, and most tanks can heal up their lost hit points between respawns anyway.  Group mez is nice at 20, but until you're in Guk or something like that, you're not seeing huge pulls.  You're seeing groups take turns on ones and twos.  The 24th level spells are a bit weak in my opinion.  What enchanters really need is a well-known spell that gives a good benefit, and they should get it at level 12.  I think it should be a weak form of Clarity.  Something that is perhaps one-third as strong as Clarity but strong enough to make enchanters desired before 29.  <P>2.  Enchanter buffs should have their duration times returned to what they were.  If not for levels 29 or higher, at least for levels 1 through 28.  Enchanters have so many debuffs, so many utility spells, so many crowd control spells, so many buffs, that it really is a problem when buffs are so short, to say nothing of Whirl and even our regular Root being so short.<P>3.  To help enchanters get experience if they're on a server like Bristlebane and to help leverage the value of those illusion spells, there should be more quests suitable for levels 8 through 28.  Whether these quests give great items or not isn't the point.  They should give decent experience.<P>I guess what I'm saying is that there are two enchanter classes.  One enchanter class is the 29 and higher class.  The other enchanter class is the 1 through 28 class.  I think that Verant has considered the 29 and higher version of enchanters to be a bit too strong.  In reducing them slightly over the past six months, they reduced the much weaker 1 through 28 level enchanters as well.  The magician class was, for all practical purposes, incomplete when the game started.  I've seen a lot of good work done to help boost it up and make it more viable -- even though they still have that incredibly tough research burden.  I'd like to see that same kind of careful, well-thought out work done to help enchanters in their teens and in their 20s.  <P>However, I don't think that I'll ever go back to my enchanter.  The problems and frustrations that I had with the class were serious.  I died 104 times in getting to level 21.  At that point, I looked at the level 24 spells, saw that they weren't really that good, and I quit him.  I just could not go on.  I could not find a group.  I could not solo.  With eight levels to go before Clarity, I simply gave up.  I started a Halfling Rogue and did not twink him.  I got him to level 10 in less than 2 days time played.   He died once over those 10 levels. I sold all of my enchanter's stuff (good stuff, too).  I bought a bunch of cleric stuff.  Now I only play a Dark Elf Cleric (on Bristlebane).  He's 18th level and he has died seven times.  I've got just over 4 days time played on him.  He's twinked, yes, but he's a survivor.  The defensive ability of the cleric is incredible, and a heal is never resisted.  You can see, now, why I think the enchanter class has some serious problems through level 28.  This latest reduction in the pet's ability is merely the latest in a series of problems for the class, in my view.<P>Thanks for your attention.<BR>Dacian, Bristlebane, Retired<BR>Antonescu, Britlebane, Healing Group Members since 1/1/00.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000375&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>You guys are ridiculous.  There is a reason you didn't get a "compensation" for this.  In case you haven't noticed, you guys are the "pet" class.  Not in that you can summon pets, but because it's Aradune's favorite class and thusly has damn near every advantage one can think of.<P>Let's see...<P>You're a pure caster, *and* you can cast Clarity on yourself.  What I wouldn't give for that as a wizard, but wait, that would make us able to solo things and actually get exp.  I can see why clerics can be crack dealers, but not why enchanters should be.<P>You can make living creatures not only *not* attack you, but fight *for* you as well.  As opposed to necromancers, who can only do this with the dead.  There are a lot more living things than dead things around Norrath, in case you didn't notice.  Oh yeah, and your lowest level pet spell components are sold by convenient vendors.  I've yet to see someone selling a stack of 20 tiny daggers for 1-2pp.<P>And lets talk about economic advantages...  the other caster classes are generally broke all the time, except you guys...<P>You get the Enchant Metal spells, which in case you haven't noticed, are an absolutely overwhelming economic advantage.  What other class can be making things that sell for 400 plat at level 20?  It's expensive for the materials, sure, but you guys have no problems passing that cost off to other players.  (Shaman Alchemy?  Gnome Tinkering?  ha!)  I have never known an enchanter to be penniless above level 10.<P>Need a discount, or just generally having faction problems with someone for a quest?  Hey, hey, hey, it's Alliance to the rescue!<P>As if those economic advantage weren't enough,  you got thicken and viscous manna, which lets you into even *more* player-run trade markets.<P>You have the Illusion line of spells, which when it comes time for you to go collect one of *your* highest level spells, makes it simply a matter of running around Norrath, unmolested by anyone or anything.  Not to mention that these illusions are not just illusions, but actual transformations into the race you're pretending to be, without any of the normal detractors people who chose to play these races would be saddled with, like abnormally lowered charisma or intelligence.  You certainly get the increased HP regeneration and night vision.<P>Are you seeing a pattern here yet?<P>There is a *reason* you guys are the "silent" class.  It's because until now you've had not a single thing to complain about compared to the other classes.  Frankly, I'm hoping you will get some actual nerfs so that you'll see a little bit of what everyone else already has to put up with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000376&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>If you think enchanters are so wonderful..then by all means, stop playing your wizard, that can teleport you to anywhere you wish, can solo, and can do great damage.... to play an enchanter that has a hard time even getting to level 20.  Oh yes...and I'm sure then you'll see just how "wonderful" those enchant metal spells are..how "great" those illusions are, etc.  Needless to say, I'm fed up with this clarity crap!!! We don't get it til level 29, for crying out loud!!! That's nothing, and at this point in my life, you know what all these people telling me to shut up are making me think?? THat when I do get clarity.. It WILL NEVER BE CAST ON ANYONE ELSE BUT ME! So ha! Then I'm sure you'll be out there complaining!<P>Yep, now I'm getting upset because you people ...the wizards...let's see...not long ago, I was in Freeport, and the wizards were attacking the guards and getting killed just to crash the zone because..oh no! YOu got nerfed!! Let's see ...so YOU can CRY, but we can't? <BR>For everone that says we are "aradune's chosen class.." What the?? Man, get with it! Anyone who can spew out the spells, but not spew out how the spells actually work..they haven't played an enchanter long enough to count!  My spells constantly are resisted, break, are worthless!!!!  So, if I'm so precious to Aradune, I think I'd be able to at least cast a mez on a freakin rock dervish that cons low green to me! Oh yeah..and at least get a charm to last for more than 20-30 seconds when I send it against another one just to "test the waters"!  So, if I'm so great, and pampered... please, tell me what I'm doing wrong, because obviously you know exactly how to play an enchanter, and I DO NOT! :P  I'm sick of people whining when something happens to their class, but telling everyone else to shut up when it happens to them.<P>~Abi<BR>pissed off enchanter!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000378&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Before I start mt rant, I would first like to say this is going to be a little off topic (sorry all).  Also I would like to say that I completelty support my fellow enchanters, the nerf to our pets without some form of compensation was unfair and I have stopped playing my enchanter sense.  <P>Abashi's lame arguement that enchanters aren't a pet class is untrue.  If we are not a pet class then why do we get pets every spell circle, hhmm?<P>What vex's me most is how Verant has been handling customer concerns lately.  How often have we heard "We are aware of the problem and are lookng in to it" or "the problem will be fixed in the next patch"<BR>Anyone at verant ever heard of cutomer satisfaction?  If I was that slow get things done at my job my Boss would fire my ass, and righfully so!<BR>This goes for problems asscoiated with all aspects of the game not just class imbalances. (my deepest sympathies to the rougues out there, you guys really got the shaft when it came to class balancing)<P>Many spells in the game need to be fixed and or dropped and replaced, this goes for all classes.  How long have the mages been waiting for the new level 8 spell renew elements to be fixed.  Didn't they say that would be fixed in the last patch?  Typical of verant to put in the time and get things fixed promptly!!<P>Also where did Verant get Abashi from?  This guy is thier PR man?  You kidding right vernat?  This guy does more to inflame sitautions then he does good.  He avoids the main context of all questions thrown at him and seem to repeat the same damn catch phrases all the time " We at verant are happy with things the way they are" (paraphrasing here)<P>"Your in our world now"  thats right verant I am, and so are about 100, 000 others (given last count i heard).  We maybe in your world, but don't forget we pay for the damn world of Norrath and put the food on your table.  Abashi telling us "he expects we will adapt" because verant is happy is unacceptable.  If a large number of players says theres a problem, then theres a problem and it better get fixed and quick!  You guys get $9.99 times 100, 000 a month to do your job, so do it allready, if that means you can't take your weekends off or sleep in  ( I suspect they all probably do) then quit.  Someone else will be more then happy to take your place I'm sure.<P>Solanthus <BR>12th Circle<BR>Veeshan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000379&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Move over druids, enchanters just replaced you as the biggest group of pussy whiners on the block.  I can't believe that one of the most well balanced and powerful classes in the game is complaining.  Since when does Verant "OWE" you compensation/  Plenty of characters are nerfed and not "compensated."  I don't understand why you idiots think that they ever compensate every class.  Grow the **** up.  That walk out is lame. Do you honestly think anyone will miss you?  First of all, walkouts aren't successful at all. None of you will really commit, and maybe 2% of total enchanters in the game will actually participate, if that much. Actually, I think I'll play my level 17 enchanter even more this week.  ****ing babies. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000380&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm...So balanced and powerful that enchanters are label as "group oriented"?  If you don't see that as the class being weak and must depend on everyone else to be able to do anything then nothing else is needed to said about your intelligent.  Why aren't druids, necros, and mages being label as "group oriented"?  Because they can basically do pretty much everything by themselves and said to hell with group when I can solo.  Most people hate grouping because it takes time to get into one(regardless what class you are at high lvl because everything is usually camped).  Not everyone have all day to play the game.  Some just have a couple hrs after work to play.  So why spend an hour or more to try getting in to a group when you can use that time to solo?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000381&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I'm not gonna gripe about pets because honestly I can't remember the last time I used mine.  I know my job is to keep all the extra baddies off the healers and casters and try to keep it so the group can fight one without having the rest pound on us.  However, I do agree that we are underpowered for this job. Often when I cast entrance (lvl 39 mez) I get the nasty red message "target has rested entrance".. OOPS!! silly me, i should have casted Tashani first, but wait.. If I had casted Tashani first, then it would have been on me sooner.. That is the main thing I'd like to see, a reduction on the resist of our Crowd Control spells.. and yes, i'd like to see the lull, soothe, pacify line made useful.. Improves like that.. I know that often the lives of the group is in OUR hands, and would like to see improvements along THOSE lines.. Also, like some people have mentioned: WHERE IS OUR ENCHANT ITEMS? We've been promised since BETA that we would be able to enchant items.. well.. I have 20 bottles cloudy mana and 20 of viscous mana and nothing to do with them.. <P>In short.. I salute you my bothers and sisters for standing up for us, but feel that your ire has been misplaced.. <P>And Verant, if you are sitting on your cloud reading this post from on high.. If you intended us to be crowd control, gives us the strength to do this job, if you intended us to be master crafters, give us THAT ability.. But I am TIRED of seeing Druids and Shamans and Warriors and Necros getting NEW stuff and Enchanters getting "oh.... uh..... we forgot about you again.. maybe you'll get what we promised you in beta next patch (you hear laugter as Verant walks off)"..<P>Your Brother in the Craft<BR>Aridholl Dreamwalker<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000382&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>If no one misses us while we are gone, then we certainly were NOT contributing that much were we?  I mean if the tanks all walked out, I'd sure miss them.  If wizzies held a walk out, I'd almost have to join them (on principle, I WOULD join them).  <BR>The fact is, you saying no one will miss us is WHY we are walking out.<BR>How would clarity make you able to solo something?  I tell you what...Find ANY 29+ enchanter on your server....tell him 'cast clarity on me, and I'll solo solb fire giants, get us BOTH exp and you that neato crown' and enchanters will crawl out of the woodwork to answer you.  Clarity reduces downtime, it does not really make soloing much easier.  YES, SOMETIMES it can HELP a LITTLE, but it does not make us able to solo.  If we had low cost, fast casting, high damage spells like wizzies, maybe, but not with what we got.<BR>I am not asking for wizzy DD BTW, just pointing out the difference.<BR>What electrum item sells for 400pp?  We cannot enchant gold until 24.  Then the only item I know that commands that kind of price is black pearl chokers.  This requires about a 160 skill to make semi-reliably, and doesnt go trivial until over 190.  Do you have a clue to what it costs to do this?  Do you know what happens to that 200pp black pearl when you fail?  Guess who has to eat that cost?  <BR>If you are not an enchanter, you just don't know.  I have backed wizards when they said they needed help EVERY TIME.  Because I know that people who play their class know more about it than I.

</FONT><HR>I sorry enchanters but I have to disagree with you on the issue of pets. You are and never WHERE a pet class. Your pet is put in there simply as another illusion, an illusion that can strike back, but an illusion none the less. It is basically a mindless automotron.  It take a strickly defensive posture (wont strike till YOU are hit first) and cant be commanded by you at all. Your pet is just an aid, given to you each round because your TRUE value as a spellcaster didnt emerge until your 29th level. It is just one of many tools in your vast arsenal of tools for survival (and it was purposely made weak so that you would not EVER come to depend on it). Your class was never, EVER, meant to solo. You knew that when you picked the class or you would all be necros and mages by now. Your class is STILL one of the most challenging and intersting one to play (except on the PVP servers). <BR>Unfortunately the GAME has deteriorated to the point where many spell casters have to solo instead of group, you realize that, in the present game environment, you are now the odd man out in terms of soloing. Ive seen hundreds of groups where I didnt know there was an enchanter in them until they cast clarity because the NEVER summoned their pets! Why? Because they knew that their pets never lasted long and werent ment to. The largest complaint ever heard from enchanters up to now was that they didnt have enough spell slots for all their spells (still a complaint from some of you from what Ive heard). <BR>Now if most of you are saying that you want some of your useless spells made useful (and what spellcaster doesnt), or even that you REALLY need those extra spell slots, fine. But if you are really bent out of shape because of the cavalir way Verant brushed off your request for compensation, and somehow have come to the conclusion that because you HAVE a pet each round, that your class is DEFINED by the pet, then I suggest that you request that Verant change the GAME back to a game where spellcasters DONT have to solo!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000384&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I will add my 2 cp. The pet nerf in and of itself is no big thing. I can and will continue to find ways to play my enchanter either solo or grouped as neccesity dicatates. But this is not just about PETS...<P>This is, to me, about the long line of broken promises and insults to the Enchanter Class.  Do I think the walkout will help ? Not really, but I participate and support my class.<P>But look at how Enchanters have been treated.<P>Illusions nerfed. Buff durations lessened, I hear Tashania has had it's effectiveness reduced. We were promised the ablity to enchant items, and so far we have WU's gloves, anyone sold one of these yet?, which we cant even use ourselves.<P>The Whirl series of spell, Verant has admited are bugged, yet have not been fixed. Bash breaks whirl and out pets bash ?? Huh what ?? Nothing ever lives long enough to debuff to make having the spells memed worthless. The enchant metal series is so mana costly, it is more profitable to adventure than enchant metal for people.<P>Other classes have better buffs than we, other classes even have better debuffs than we. Mes and the like (I am told, being only L.37 I have not been there) have become useless in the planes.<P>Necros, the acknowledged most powerful class, get new spells to compensate them for the "pet nerf" and they include MANA TRANSFER spells, so far, the sole role of the Enchanter.  There are so many speed items in the game our speed series of spells is not sought out.<P>When we do try to talk to Verants representatives about it, we are insulted, and told to go away (basically).<P>I can see the pet issue is a bug, and needed to be fixed, but they give compensation to the pet using necros, the pet using mages get boosted, and we get nerfed and told go away, "we" (Verant) are happy with it.<P>What would happen if we stopped Enchanting Metal for anyone? or casting clarity on everyone? that might get attention, unfortunatly, it hurts the players, not Verant  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/frown.gif">  We just want to be heard this time around.

</FONT><HR>Agree with Jack above there.  Please don't post if you think that enchanters are complaining about the pet issue...it is NOT.  The pet thing is just one of the many issues that enchanters can no longer silent.  It along with Abashi insulted post were what brought upon the enrage.  Most enchanters could care less about the pet, but what about all other useless spells that enchanters have?  The class is so weak by itself that it can't solo successfully without some thinking and a lot of effort.  Group oriented means the class is pathetic and need other to kill anything.  Enchanters are not the only "group oriented" class.  pretty much all meleers and hybrids are "group oriented" classes.  They can't hunt anything by themselves with any reasonable success compare to Druids, Necros, or Mages.  Now why is that?  If balance is what they are after, why not make all classes can solo and group as well as any other class?  And please don't said some class is suppose to be able to solo better than other.  All classes are thought up by actual human and can easily be change.  Were there no tales of Paladins and Knights of the round table in King Arthur court slaying dragons and such?  Good stories and made up by writers.  So why can't a Pally be able to solo Nag and Vox or atleast be able to solo as well as a necro or mage?  It was because the game designer at Verant didn't designed accordingly.  So they changed the role of what a Paladin can and can't do.  They change it so that clearly some class are stronger than other and yet still saying that they want balance.  To see which class is stronger than other can sometime be hard, but one way to find out is to see how easy it is for a class to kill something compare to another class.  It will be clear which class is weaker than which.  Granted that enchanter is still in better shape then most classes(melee and hybrid, and maybe wiz), it's still a weak class compare to necros, mages, and druids.  Which in term give enchanters the right to complain for balance.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000386&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>We ARE a pet class.  Any nonsense about a difference between a pet class and a class with pet is ignorance showing itself.  Pets are a tool and we use them.  Paladins AREN'T a pet class....they NEVER get a pet.  Shamans ARE a pet class, they just have to wait longer for them.  They damn sure use them when they get them though.<BR>If you are saying our class is not a pet class because we aren't defined by our pet BECAUSE its not what we do the most, then I guess Verant classifies us by what we do the most.  So, are we a clarity dispensing class or a resisted by mobs class?<BR>Again, nerfing our pets was NOT a bug fix.  This was a tactic that GZ said we could do when he was saying why we would never get commands.<BR>The argument that they are mindless would work better on a necro pet than ours.  An illusion should do just what we want while something drawn up from the dead might well have its own agenda, or even unable to hear since it has no ears.  I AM NOT SUGGESTING A NECRO NERF....just shooting holes in some half-baked rationalization by a non-enchanter on why we should be grateful to verant for this nerf to clarify our roles in their vision of the game.<BR>  Dear old Abashi at least strongly implied that it was okay to nerf us because we were quiet, so we  are fixing that.<P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Leirra Wayfarrer<BR>Enchantress at Large</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000387&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>To Dagmar, <P>Now that you made your point. Let me make mine. <P>I may not be speaking for all enchanters however some do have my point of view on things. Its not the Pet nerf, that got us made however it was the last straw into the many nerfs they have done to us. I wouldn't call it 'Compensation' but a "FIX" to our existing spells that are practically useless. <P>I am not going to make an excuse or an explaination to why we got Clarity. But what Clarity to us is almost a double edge sword. We love it for use, we hate it because we are defined by it (crack queen, Crack machine, Crack dealer, etc.) It was so easy for me to get into a group after 29. Very hard before then.<P>I agree that Charming is a powerful thing. However at times Charming can be dangerous, especially when it breaks after a second it is casted on. Easy death for us. Mastering Charm takes a lot of work and a lot of deaths trust me. Its unpredicatable at times and that's why its dangerous.<P>If you don't have an DE friend or you are not a DE enchanter getting these Enchant metal spells can be quite an adventure. And when you get them its like what next? Silver bars cost about 5 gold, Electrum cost about 2.5pp, Gold cost about 11pp, and Platinum cost 110pp. And then you have to consider the Gems used...the most sought out Gems are usually 55pp and up. And to get a skill sufficent to make those Jewelry you will end up spending at least 2k-3kpp if not more. I have spent 1kpp so far and my skill is at 132.<P>Alliance/Benevolence is great for NPCs that con with Apprehensive and lower. However Benevolence doesn't go as high as Aimable I believe. Some Quest do need Aimable and higher factions even up to Warmly or Kindly. Our spells won't let us go that high. <P>As for the Enchant items spells, The Viscous/thicken mana series well...would you like a pair of Wu's Fighting Gauntlets? =) They only thing we can make that cost 50pp and are worth 15pp. I also like to add this was promised to us since beta. Since then we have one item to show for it. *shrugs*<P>As for illusions, where it 'suppose' to hide Faction/religion from NPCs so we can go anywhere unmolested. Well think again, NPCs 'see' through religion. We can't go everywhere and anywhere unmolested. <P>The pattern I see is different than yours...<P>Dagmar sorry if I flamed you. Its just that first sentence really got me going. Its so damn condecending. Kinda reminds me of Abashi's remarks on Enchanters. I just wanted you to see our point of view.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000388&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Yup, gotta admit this whole issue is about Abashi.  His whole post was rude and insulting and showed he has never played an enchanter.<P>Thought I'd go over the whole pet class/not a pet class issue and from there branch into why we are ticked.<P>Pet Class:  A class that relies upon its pets to absorb pretty much all the damage as well as contribute a significant portion of the damage.  Our pets have low hp, they aren't meant to tank stuff for us for an extended period of time.  Face it, we aren't a pet class.<P>Not-A-Pet-Class:  A class that cannot summon a pet or summons one that is so worthless nobody uses it other then as a parlor trick.  The pets don't contribute significantly offensively or defensively.  Our pets are useful, therefore, we are also not a Not-A-Pet-Class.<P>So what are we?  We are a Not-A-Not-A-Pet-Class.  We pretty much don't really rely much upon our pets to absorb damage.  We do however rely heavily upon our pets to do damage.  We are in effect, a hybrid between pet classes and non-pet classes.<P>  And its here where Abashi shows his complete ignorance of us and what ticks us off so much.  When we solo or are in small parties where crowd control isn't that big of an issue, we use our pets to do a significant portion of our damage for us.  We debuff some in the beginning, draw the mobs ire, get hit once, and then we kick back and med and buff, nuking from time to time or whatever.  On the solo track, again, the pet is significant for the damage it does.  With an attack speed buff, our pet will do more damage then our DD spells, especially if we fear the mob.  No, what ticks us off is that one of our major offensive options got chopped by about a third of its effectiveness.  Consider how you would feel if one of the two DD's you alternated suddenly did only 66% of what it does now.  If your double attack hits only hit for 66% damage...you'd be ticked.  You'd be even more ticked if Abashi were to say "Well, that's okay, because you aren't a necro and besides, you have ability A" [which you've always had and which necro's have better then you at some levels for their pets].  Its the shear unbridled arrogance, unresearched claims, and total in your face we're gonna hose you and write off your complaints no matter how valid that has us ticked.  It's total bogus and Verant owes all of us enchanters a major apology for Abashi's comments.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000390&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

When the boards start filling up with people who cant find an Enchanter and are pissed cause the class is on the decline, then they will be forced to take action.

</FONT><HR>Asterix, ahh thanks your post was very enlightening. It helped clarify (hehe unintended pun) a few things. I just thought from the topic title it was mainly about pet upgrades for enchanters, but I see that it is a larger issue, and that pets did serve a useful purpose for enchanters that has been somewhat diminished with the last pet change. I did think that Verant made a blunder in saying that enchanters were overlooked because they, up until now, were SO quiet a class, Hahaha.  But that statement DOES show that Verant notices those who squawk (unfortunate but its seems to be true). Actually I hope that this BOYCOTT will cause Verant to review some of the enchanter's conserns.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000392&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have struggled and struggled through my younger years.  I have to say that life has always been tough for myself.  Here I am 45 and think of myself as a pretty decent enchanter.  Why were things so tough for me early on?  Well, initially there were no animations and Tashan was a resistible spell.  God, life sucked.  Our spells constantly were being resisted especially Tashan!  Enchanters swore the class was unplayable and begged for a change.  If only Tashan was made to be non-resistible then there would be wide-spread happiness.  After much debate we get this all-important turning point for our class and we even got animations to boot.  We have always been a tough class to play and I hope that doesnt change.  Everyone wants something.  <P>Frankly I hate animations and think our charming skill is horrible.  To say that we are not a pet class is silly.  We have an entire charm series and create animations.  Even if you were to claim the animations are not pets (and they are NOT, more of a moving damage shield that can be buffed) you would have to take into account our charm series.  Because we can not summon a pet to command doesnt mean we cant have one ; )  Regardless, we are not ment to be a solo class and yet there will always be people that will find a way.  I do not think much of the pet nerf but have a couple issues that I wish were changed<P>1. Spirit Wolf.  Why the hell cant we cast this illusion indoors?  It comes down to druids not thinking it is fair I guess.  The illusion doesnt give as much faction as the druids AND doesnt even have a SoW attached.  The one thing that is good about the form is the Cold Resistance that is added.  Spirit Wolf has the Cold and Dry Bones has the Fire.  It is comical that the one place where the illusion has a use is Permafrost and yet we can not use it there!<BR>2. Rune IV.  Come on now!  The component costs 14 plat a shot compared to the 7 gold of Rune III!  That is an extreme jump for a 100 hit points extra.<BR>3. Take away the invisible stun factor out of enchanter spells.  It is hard for two enchanters to work together if one is blasting since it will counter the others crowd control!<BR>4. Whirl and Whirl II needs work.  We should either get single opponent stuns the work like colors or fix these.  There is no reason why a single critter stun has to have a higher mana cost and higher casting time then an AE one!  I use colors constantly, but there are simply times when it is unwise to use AE anything and so we should have our single stuns work better.<P>I do not want the enchanter class to be a cake-walk like most of the other classes.  I hate seeing all the incompetent enchanters in the realms and feel that the majority came from the soloing ranks or simply are fools I dont know for sure. <P>-Moonshadow       <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000393&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Moonshadow, here's some info for yah.<P>Spirit Wolf:  Our spirit wolf changes base factions pretty much exactly as much as the druid one does.  In short, anyone agnostic becomes viewed as indifferent by just about anything as long as you haven't ticked it off (ruined your factions with it).  The reason it was changed was for that reason, the power of its faction shifting.  Spirit Wolf was used as the way to do corpse recoveries on dragon raids.  Guess the people helping others have to die too, but anyway, that's why we can't cast it indoors.<P>Rune IV:  Yah, its kinda nuts, the cost, but in case you haven't noticed, it's the exact same component used by every other classes equiv (diamond skin) as well as other classes that progress through stones (like the clerical symbol series).  Don't expect to see this change.<P>Stun Factor:  This counters crowd control???  Uhm, damage breaks stun.  In no was does our DD's spell stun factor bother crowd control.  Now, yes, our stun factor does make our spells a bit more resisted, but on the opposite side, its very useful against casters.  It's a defining part of our DD and I've got no problems with it.<P>Whirl series:  Yup, these need work (or just flat out remove them).  As for the single target stuns, what do you think the mes line is?  Mez at 20 mana costs less then the second color spell (which costs 50) and lasts for almost twice as long.  What's the problem here?  As for how you'd like a single target stun to work like colors, I don't get it.  Colors is great because you don't have to target, it's pb ae.  For any single target spell, you'd have to target.  So just mez it.<P>I'm kinda wondering about those last comments of yours.  Other classes don't have a cakewalk (though many tanks have the walk part, as they stroll from place to place trying to find a group).  And you know, comments like that won't endear anyone to your cause.  Because from their view, enchanters have a cakewalk.  All they see is clarity and jewelcraft, with no realization of the struggle to 29 and how swamped the jewelcraft market is.  Nor do they realize that in the days when we struggled our way up, the majority of enchanters that were started quit playing their enchanters before they reached 20.  Anyway, try not to make offhand general comments such as that=)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000394&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well, I agree on turning the whirl series into single target color spells of short duration and casting time.  In case you didn't notice, Mes takes a LOT longer to cast than color line.  Now why would I want this?  Well, while the color line is smart enough not to hit my group members on Rallos, it still hits all their pets (including my own).  Strangely, a 3 second stun is more infuriating to all pets within radius that all the damage that any mob can muster.  They will all stop what they are doing and come beat on me.  The mobs also forget about the dual wielding double attacking menaces and their owners and come beat on me also.  I consider this undesirable.  However, sometimes a sigle mob is beating on me and I need to get a quick stun off to get enough casting time to enthrall the annoyance.  <BR>  You know, in an interview about EQ in a gaming magazine (comparing it to UO and AC), Verant once said they wanted EQ to recreate the classic pen and paper role playing game experience with the added enhancements available in a computer game. I did some research.  The earliest versions of D&D date back to 1973 (I really had no idea it was so old).  Between 1973 and 2000 (that is 27 YEARS for you Arithmetically challenged), they never nerfed ANY class.  Not ONCE.  Every change they made to a class was to make it stronger (more spells, more hp, more abilitites, more options).  They gave players the option of taking weaknesses in one area to be stronger in another, but they never flat out NERFED a class.  EQ can't seem to go 27 DAYS without nerfing someone.<BR>HINT:  Verant, quit nerfing.  The mobs in the game don't pay you to play.  Why do you care if they are happy?<BR>I was getting ready to log on as my paladin the other night, and realized that I really didn't FEEL like playing EQ.  I am tired of ALL players having to put up with nerfs when they are uncalled for.  If a spell has a bug exploit, fix it how you can with minimal impact to the game, but most casters were much happier in June than they are today.  You did want HAPPY customers didn't you?  <BR>I am glad to see that tanks are being enhanced, make no mistake.  The 66% damage in PvP has some merit, though why I have to take full weapon damage eludes me when the same balancing principle would apply).  <BR>The short version:  FIX THINGS AND LEAVE THEM ALONE.  Work on delivering what you promised, and we will be happy.  Quit trying to 'balance' us by squashing us all equally flat.  If you had simply upped the damage for mage pets and explained that it was because mages are master summoners and were supposed to have the best pets, but that making them dual would force you to do THIS, then spent the rest of the time you spent dumping this in our laps fixing say Rogues, you would not have NEARLY so many angry customers.  I think even the most powergaming everquaking Necro (not that all necros are like that) would be okay with it.<P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Leirra Wayfarrer<BR>Enchantress at Large</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000395&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Axterix En'Obelix, I am skeptical about a couple things<P>1. Spirit Wolfs faction.  I certainly know why they threw this out, but does the illusion have the same faction adjustment as Wolf Form?  Again it might be me, but I do not see huge faction increases.  A little yes, but not always.  Sort of like the elemental or skeleton forms we have.  I still see critters that want to kill me and even stood next to druids while they were in their wolf form and compared.  I have always been under the suspicion that they sort of did a double hit on us.  Took away the faction protection of the Spirit Wolf (or lowered it) while making it outdoors only.  If I am right about the faction then I think we should be able to have it indoors.  If I am wrong about it then maybe things simply hate me more.<BR>2. Rune IV.  Good, we agree.<BR>3. Yes, I am very sorry to say this, but our DDs are much more prone (like just about always) of breaking a critter out of a stun from colors or whirl.  It is that little unseen stun that is added, but it has been noticed and written about on the boards at least in the past and I have noticed a difference myself.  If I team up with a solid blasting enchanter I will always have a bit more work on my hands then a wizard.<BR>4. Mez is different then single target stuns just like an AE mez is different then colors.  You whirl a critter or cast colors again and again you would notice that the tanks are not being hit nearly as much.  Why is that?  Well, I guess you didnt know, but a critter when hit while mezed breaks out swinging but a critter stunned from say colors will stay stunned for the precious seconds required to renew its stun.  So you get a room full of critters, mez all but the one your tanks are fighting and let loose on colors again and again while periodically maintaining the mezes.  The cleric will get bored not needing to heal anyone.  So why the hell do you need a single critter stun like the clerics, etc use?  Well, the AE Colors isnt always smart to use for example in areas which has levels above or beneath you.  You can easily get more then you want. <P><BR>-Moonshadow     <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000397&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>What dumbass designed our pet anyway? Nice idea, poor followthrough. We have an invisible form with a shield and a weapon. I could not care less how tough our pet is, but is should be awfully darn hard to hit. I have not noticed this to be the case.<P>They definately need mega taunt, perhaps even on all the mobs attacking the enchanter.<P>I have no idea how many commands normal pets have, but enchanters should have 3 for their pets. They should be: PROTECT ME=come to my defense if I am hit. HEEL=stand beside me and don't attack. GO AWAY=pet disolves.<P>It should never wander off, perhaps not even when chasing a fleeing mob. Our pet should not hunt down and kill stuff. Heck when I am medding it should sit right on top of me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000398&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
