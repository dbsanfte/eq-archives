<b>Chapter Six</b><br><i>A Sacrifice. A Crystal. A Lich</i></center><p>
     Simonic's pace had slowed down to a walk, as they entered the bloody mess of corpses and debris before the pond and bank.  Tiethroe examined the area, and immediately squealed as he saw the form of his master on the ground.  Before either Simonic or Dorson could say anything, the half elf was already in the direction of his fallen master.   Simonic followed in his footsteps, with Dorson trailing behind him, who was still awe struck by the sheer amount of blood and carnage.<p>
     As they came to the form of Ebon Strongbear, Tiethroe was already on top of him, not hiding his tears, as they dripped onto the swordmaster's armor.  Simonic came up next to the body and knelt down, observing the entire body.  The armor was dented in from the obvious stampeding, but none of it was had been penetrated.  His helmet, had been recently discarded, and he seemed to be breathing faintly.  At this sign, Sim motioned for Tiethroe to get off of his master.<p>
     Simonic began to chant an ancient prayer, one that either Dorson or Tiethroe had ever heard.  It's sound almost melodic.<p><center><i>  
"From within Time's great Hall,<br>
A forger forges life and steel,<br>
Restoring strength of giants tall,<br>
And life within that none shall ever steal,<br><p>

"From within Time's great Hall,<br>
A god gives thee life,<br>
Giving power of their call,<br>
Removing all thy strife." <br></center></i><p>

     As he sang it, the armor which had been dented in, resumed it's normal position and smoothness.  His breathing also seemed to quicken and resume to normal, and slowly his eyes began to slowly open.  As he glanced about him, he coughed.  Dor and Tiethroe exchanged glances, they had heard tales of songs being able to heal, but either of them had seen it actually done.  Many throughout the town claimed only bards could do such things, but if they could, either of them had ever witnessed the event, and so declared it false.<p>
     "Ebon!"  Tiethroe called, as he leapt onto his master.<p>
     "Ugh!" was all Ebon to utter as the weight of a young half elf landed atop of him.  However, he put up a smile at his ecstatic scout.  "How ye been, Tie?"<p>
     "Tie?  You've never called me that before?"  Now, a look of concern creased his brow, as he looked down.<p>
     "Tiethroe, I'm a bit tired and out of breath, it was easier to utter out.  Do you not like it?  It is half your name."  Ebon was continuing to improve his breathing, even trying to move a bit under the weight of the half elf.<p>
     "Oh, I don't mind it, was just a little surprised," Tie poked Ebon's cheek and squirmed "you're really alive!"<p>
     Ebon chuckled and nodded, " ye didn't think I'd let a gnoll kill me did ya?"<p>
     A grin spread across the scouts lips, as he removed one of the daggers at his waist, and held it "o'course not master!  Dog's don't know how to use things like this."<p>
     Ebon nodded and asked if Tie could please get off.  After much reluctance the half elf finally got off, and Ebon stood up from the ground.  As he stood and looked around, his face went pale.<p>  
     "Did –", Ebon's gaze swept over the entire area before the pool and bank, "did we lose?"<p>
     None spoke, and it wasn't until now that Ebon noticed Simonic and Dorson were next to him.  A look of discernment went over the Swordmaster's face.<p>
     "Do you know what happened here, Mage?" his voice stung with an accusation as he peered at Simonic.<p>
     "My guess, Swordmaster, is as good as yours," Simonic's eyes seemed to flare as he leveled his gaze on Ebon.  It was Ebon now who turned away and look towards the carnage past the bank.<p>
     "I assume they reached the Hall, that's where we were headed, or so I had thought." Ebon was already heading in the direction of the Hall, passing the bank, stepping over fallen corpses of men and dog.<p>
     Tiethroe was only a step or two behind his master, as Dorson walked alongside Simonic.  The sight was utterly gruesome.  Blood soaked the stone floor, and streaks lined the walls of buildings.  Ebon had never seen such carnage caused by the gnolls before, even to him a veteran, his stomach churned.  Dorson, however, was not used to such sights, and emptied his stomach onto the bloodied floor.  As he heaved, Simonic gently patted his back.<p>
     Tiethroe, on the other hand, didn't seem to mind the carnage.  He almost skipped from bare spot to bare spot, not wanting to interrupt the sleep of the dead.  Until, he ran into the back of a stock still Ebon.  As the half elf looked up at his master's face, it was pale white.  Following his masters gaze, Tiethroe let out a gasp.  The Hall, and everything surrounding was destroyed.  Fires still burned, giving a grim aura around the coming dawn.<p>
     Even here, more corpses laid.  Simonic looked up above the tower of the hall and frowned.  Reminisce of a powerful spell still lingered, but only to one with the sight for such things.  Ebon walked among the fallen bodies, and stopped at one kneeling quickly.  It was Camlend.<p>
     "No.." Uttered the Swordmaster, as he began to turn the pierced corpse of his friend over onto it's back.<p>
     Ebon began running his fingers to the wrists and neck, checking for any sign of life but found none.  His eyes began to burn, rage within him rose, something had to be done.<p>
     As the Swordmaster knelt, there was a sound behind him.  A clank of armor moving from under rubble and then a door opened.  Ebon's blades were already out, as were Tiethroe's, who's ears perked up at the sound.  Simonic raised an eye brow in the direction of the noise, as Dorson continued to hold back his empty stomach.  <p>
     As the door opened, a form covered in dust stepped out.  It was a human.  Lowering his guard Ebon stepped over to the man, and when he approached the man smiled.  Even though the dust and ash had painted this man's face black and grey, the smile gave his person away.  Tonmerk survived.  As his friend approached, Ebon's smiled lessened when he saw a bloody gash in the side of his friend.<p>
     "Do not worry about it Ebon, my fate is sealed." the High Priest of Nife stated as he leaned up against the door post.<p>
     As Ebon heard his friends voice, he realized the age of it.  It sounded scratchy, and gruff.  The sound of one on their last moments of life after putting up a long and hard battle.  Simonic glanced up at the two, and thought it best if they were left alone.  Tapping Dorson on the shoulder, they entered the fallen ruins of the Hall where Dorson soon collapsed and began to sleep.<p>
     "May Nife preserve!  You can't die Tonmerk!", Ebon protested stepping closer as if to aid the priest.<p>
     Tonmerk held up a warning hand as Ebon approached, "stop sounding a fool, what happened here was due to my poor calculations and inaccurate judgment.  This is by far the best way I can purge this sin from my life before I enter in with Nife."<p>
     "But – Camlend died as well, and I'm not letting my closest friend die as well!"  Pain was easily seen on the Swordmaster's face, as he pleaded in almost agony with his friend.<p>
     "It is for Camlend, Ebon, that I shall sacrifice my life on this land for, absolving my sin this day,"  With that the cleric limped over to the fallen body of Camlend Serbold." I have not enough energy to help them all, for my life is fleeting quickly, but this is my last true gift to you Ebon, my friend, and fellow brother."<p>
     Ebon's eyes no longer held his feelings back, tears streamed down his cheeks, even Tiethroe's eyes began to water as he watched in silence.  Tonmerk stood straight, letting go of the wound at his side, letting his life begin to freely leak out of him as bloodied hands began to move in an intricate spell, and it was here that he began to recite the old code of honor, long forgotten for one who sacrificed his life for another.<p>
     As the spell was being recited, spectral forms began to swirl about the area, metallic howls drifted through the air.  The souls of all those slain within this area howled to be called back or to be left alone, swirling among the calling of life back into the realms. <p> 
     "For you Camlend Serbold, I give my life," spoke the priest as he began to finish the spell.<p>
     From among the spirits, at the calling of a name, all but one dispersed back into the clear air.  The one form, wavered in front of them, as if he could see them and perhaps he could.  Ebon's eyes were locked on the form, until he heard a small sniff from Tonmerk.  Shifting his glance to the priest he saw strong streaks of tears sliding down his old wrinkled cheeks.  The priest looked to be in utter pain, but his task was not yet complete.<p>
     Finally, the priest slurred out the last words to complete his task.  A brilliant blue-white light shimmered around the fallen form of Camlend, the spectra above began to move downward as if being pulled back into it's body.  The muscles in the priest flexed, as if in a struggle to stay a bit longer, but the blood leaking out of his side continued to flow, as his skin began to take on an even whiter texture.<p>
     "Ebon – Hold the love of – Nife and always rid life – of useless death," the priest's words trailed off, Ebon thought he had said more after death, but could not make them out.  What happened next, he assumed that the priest invoked the final sacrifice.<p>
     Around the form of the high priest, white fire caught aflame and began to burn.  As he burned, Camlend began to stir, coughing lightly.  Simonic walked back into the street greeted by a brilliant sight, speaking a soft word, Dorson lifted his head to see the spectacle.  It was a rare sight, only used by priests of high art and skill.  It burned away all traces of their being, armor and all.  It had been said that it was a sign that they entered the holy plane of their deity, burning their flesh bodies.  No resurrection could call them back from that plane.<p>
     Slowly, the white flames dimmed, until the form it had been burning around was no longer there, and a golden belt and silvered hammer hit the ground below.  All was silent, except for the rousing Camlend who was oblivious to everything that was going on around him.  Ebon and the others, save Simonic, just stared at where the priest had been a moment before.  Ebon had lost the only man he could truly label his father, and he wept.<p><center>
**********************************************<p></center>
     The caverns ranked of mildew and stale air.  Malok began to wonder if they didn't have enduring breath on themselves if they would be able to breath within the water-mountain cove.  As he and the rest of his comrades stepped out of the ice cold water, they began to shake themselves dry, as so many dogs do.<p>
     Malok, a tall muscular gnoll, walked about the cavern they rose up to the surface in.  He eyed the mountain walls, touching them to feel their texture as it was slick with slime and moss.  Malok wore a bright chest plate, denoting his rank among the gnoll clans.  He was, their emperor so to speak.  He commanded or played heavily among all the gnolls, excluding the traitors within High Pass.  <p>
     As he walked around the room, he searched for some sign on the walls.  The others with him, just stared observing whatever he was and one began to sniffle, giving himself a cold wet nose.  At the sound, Malok turned his head sharply and gave an evil gaze at the sniffling gnoll, who froze and held back any more sniffles.<p>
     "Well, brothers, I believe this is the spot," as he spoke in his deep growling voice, his hand moved through the mountain wall, as if it weren't there," our friend decided to put illusions up to lead us astray, smart man."<p>
     Many of the gnolls gasped as their leader stepped into the mountain wall and disappeared, barking out in rage that the mountain had eaten their emperor.  The howling was soon stopped when the head of Malok poked out through the wall and ordered them to follow, they all reluctantly did as they were ordered.  Even for a gnoll, walking into a wall was not something they did often, but to be ordered to walk through was another thing.  As they stepped through, gurgles which were meant to be laughs filled the caverns.  Malok just rolled his eyes wondering how they had been given such high rank within their clans.<p>
     The emperor of the gnolls, was tall and his fur was brown mixed in the aging grey streaks and white.  He stepped about with sure and swift footing, holding a leather sack under his arm, and a long staff in the other hand.  The top of the staff held a dark black crystal, which seemed to glow within the cavern light.  The light within the cavern, made Malok wonder, there was light yet no source of light.  No fires or sun roof.  He deemed it some powerful magic and told the others to watch out and not look into the light.  Where he later had to explain himself when half his party started to walk around blindly hitting into walls.<p>
     The cavern tunnels seemed to go on and on, until they came to another illusionary wall.  It was behind here that made them stop and stare in awe.  Lining the walls were books upon books, in the center was a large wooden table, broken at the right side causing it to slant downward.  At the floor of the broken table laid candles, more books, and maps.  Malok walked about the room, holding his arm up to keep the others back, for fear that they might mess with something they should not.<p>
     The walls in this room, did not appear to be like the other ragged mountain walls, but they were smoothed, and held fixtures up to them.  On one wall, there was a painting of a man, who appeared to be young.  He wore a dark robe in the picture and seemed to have some spell taking effect about his hand, the man was not smiling.  Malok leaned up closer and noticed it was an erudite man, scoffing at the image, he resumed his search about the room.<p>
     As Malok continued to search, he found a tome that intrigued him, as he began to open it one of his comrades interrupted him.<p>
     "Master, our employer wishes to speak with you immediately," this gnoll, was known as Barnok, the only one from the company that Malok trusted and held enough respect to give him personal assignments.  Barnok, was the commander of most the Tesch clan and no fool.<p>
     "Tell him I'm busy," Malok responded without even lifting his head from the tome.<p>
     It was now, for the first time, it had spoken as a low yet high metallic sounding voice filled the air.<p>
     "Malok, put that tome away, complete my assignment and you'll have more than a lifetime to do such studies," the voice, was clear, but was muffled a little.<p>
     At the voice, Barnok gasped and reached into his pouch and retrieved an average sized crystal.  Lights within swirled with some magical essence.  Malok growled to himself and lifted his gaze and thoughts out of the book.<p>
     "Very well, what do we do now, the lich isn't here."  The sound of his voice did not try to hide his impatience.<p>
     "He is, open the book and turn to," the metallic voiced chimed loud and clear, and as it spoke the crystal pulsed, "now recite that spell, it calls all undead, of power,  within a rather large area to you."<p>
     Malok did as he was instructed, removing the tome beneath his arms and opened it up keeping the leather covering the sides so his fur would not singe, yet his fingers writhed in pain as they touched the pages.  Turning a few, letting the air fill with the smell of burned fur and flesh, he reached the requested page and began to review it's contents.<p>
     Malok then turned his gaze forward and uttered a word, ‘<i>Delah-Urian</i>' as he held up one finger.  At those uttered words, a dark swirl took about his finger as he began to trace into the air symbols of ancient days.  As his finger went about the motions, the air that was touched by the finger turned black, and soon was burned by a short flame as it followed until the spell was complete.<p>
     For a moment, nothing took place and Malok had begun to look through the book again to make sure he casted it correctly, what happened next assured him he had.  The mountain began to grown as an unearthly cry filled the caverns.  Air from no known source began to beat throughout the room.  Before them, a form was being shaped into the air, at the sight Malok took a few paces back yet hoping none of his comrades had noticed his fear.<p>
     Cries of the undead continued to ring in their ears, some of the other gnolls covered them, or forced them down.  It was almost unbearable, and the form had still not finished the calling.  Within a moment, all ceased.  Air, screams, noises, everything.  Before them, floated the undead form of Miragul.  All seemed to be stunned by the sight of the lich.  Very few upon the land of Norrath had ever actually seen a lich but only heard stories.  The magic that it took to transform oneself into a creature of unimaginable undead power was amazing.  And now before them stood one of Norrath's greatest mage.  <p>

The airy outline of his body shifted as if being hit by an unseen breeze as a slight grin came to his phantom lips.  The lich moved his hands to his chest and opened up his robe, exposing a ghastly chest, where something seemed to be missing there.  His fiery eyes returned their gaze back upon Malok.<p>
