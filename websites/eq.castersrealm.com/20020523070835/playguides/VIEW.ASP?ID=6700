  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>General Information about Spells and Spellcasting
<BR>
<BR>
The shaman is a wisdom-based caster class.  The shaman's ability to cast spells depends on the amount of mana each spell to be cast requires and the shaman's total amount of mana at the time.
<BR>
<BR>
The amount of mana a shaman has is based upon their base wisdom stat and pieces of equipment worn that might give them wisdom or raw mana.  At higher levels, enchanters have spells that can increase a shaman's wisdom and therefore the amount of mana they have, although wisdom over 200 adds little to the shaman's mana pool.  
<BR>
<BR>
Some people think that because a shaman is not an int caster, the shaman doesn't have as much mana.  This is absolutely untrue, and because the shaman has the ability to cannibalize their hit points into mana at later levels, the shaman actually has the ability to add to his or her mana pool in a way that few other casters can.  As a shaman, you will likely be constantly complaining that you don't have enough mana.  This is no surprise, because shamans are constantly casting spells, whether before a fight (buffs), during a fight (debuffs, slows, heals, and even damage spells where appropriate), or after a fight (more heals). 
<BR>
<BR>
The shaman's spells are broadly separated out into general categories as follows:
<BR>
<BR>
1.	Heal spells (includes cure disease/poison type spells)<BR>
2.	Buff spells (includes spells that increase armour class, hit points, attack speed, and all regular stats except int and wis)<BR>
3.	Debuff spells (lowers armour class, attack speed, resistances to various spells, and regular stats of mobs, except int and wis)<BR>
4.	DD or direct damage spells,<BR>
5.	DoT or damage over time spells (including our pets), and<BR>
6.	General utility spells (such as gate, root, bind affinity, shrink, spirit of wolf).<BR>
<BR>
Many of our key spells are high mana cost spells, particularly spells that slow mobs and damage spells, which is why some people wrongly assume that shamans don't have a large mana pool.  
<BR>
<BR>
Many of our key spells also have a high taunt value to mobs, which means that when you cast them, you can expect to have the mob's full attention for a while after casting.  At higher levels, when mobs can summon you, you can expect to be summoned to the mob on a regular basis.
<BR>
<BR>
Don't underestimate resist spells.  If you know that your opponent mob casts cold DD spells and you have cold resist gear or spells, use them.  You'll cut down the damage they can do to you by a fair amount.  At higher levels, you will want high resist gear because some of the mobs you fight will be casters that can kill you with one spell.  Know your enemy.
<BR>
<BR>
Just a word on skill and getting it: Every single time you level, plan to spend some down time getting your spell school skills up to max.  This makes you the most effective shaman you can be for your level.   It can also help you raise your channelling skill.  Take a low level low mana cost spell for each of the spell schools, lock yourself in a safe place and start casting on yourself.  Here's a list of good ones:
<BR>
<BR>
Abjuration: Inner Fire<BR>
Alteration: *lowest heal spell*<BR>
Conjuration: Summon Food<BR>
Divination: True North/Sense Animals (use them in tandem to save recast time)<BR>
Evocation: Burst of Flame (caution... go find someone's corpse to do this on.. don't practice on npcs).<BR>
<BR>
If you're very low level, Inner Fire is a more effective heal spell than is the first heal spell you get.  I don't think Verant intended it to work that way, but it's much more mana effective and it might even save your life.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
DD vs. DoT spells
<BR>
<BR>
Typically, you cast damage spells mainly when you are soloing.  It is well known that DD spells are less mana efficient than DoT spells.  The difficulty is that, depending on what stage in your career you are, sometimes your DD spells are far more powerful than your DoTs.  Either way, you can expect some attention from the mobs if you cast these.  If your DoTs are lagging behind your nukes for damage, you may want to use the 'root and nuke' method of soloing.  This keeps the mob off you while you med back up a bit.  If you haven't got your root spell yet, you can do something called 'blind kiting', where you cast your damage spell and then Flash of Light on the mob, giving you time to med up before flash of light wears off and the mob remembers you're still on its hate list.  After level 49, you can expect to use mainly DoTs while soloing, and the 'root and DoT' method.  Generally both of these methods involve some melee by you and/or your pet at the end.  Bear in mind that a root has a chance to break each time the mob is hit, and when you are DoTting a mob, it takes damage every tick, and each tick is a chance for root to break.  This is an argument in favour of DD spells, which hit only once.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Debuffs
<BR>
<BR>
Before you attack that <insert mob name here>, remember to debuff it.  Commonly, shamans use their slow debuff to pull a mob because the mob won't hit as fast when it gets there.  What is also quite useful is the 'weaken' line (also called the 'cripple' line).  This line reduces the mob's armour class, strength, agility (ability to dodge your blows), stamina (hitpoints) and dexterity.
<BR>
<BR>
If you have the mana and the spell, you can use one of the malise line (also called the 'malo line'), but this is more commonly used in the higher level game, where it is ESSENTIAL, because it helps every caster in your group or raid to land their spells.  Some mobs are so magic resistant that they will resist the malo-line spells (there's one exception to that which you don't have to know about right now).  If you're casting this spell and having problems with resists, start off with the lowest level in the line and work your way up (i.e. cast Malise and then Malisement).  This is a common tactic.  
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cannidancing
<BR>
<BR>
The shaman's life is largely stand up-cast cann-sit down-stand up -cast cann-sit down, over and over again.  This is called the cannidance.  In order to do the cannidance, you should have cast a regeneration spell on yourself first.  The aim of the cannidance is to get the greatest mana-health regeneration possible in the shortest amount of time.
<BR>
<BR>
In EQ, a tick is approximately 6 seconds.  In that 6 seconds, you will regenerate hitpoints and mana at a set rate per tick.  That regen rate is faster if you're sitting down.  So here's the trick, and it's a trick of timing.  Sit until you see the health and mana bars jump up a little.  Then stand up, quickly cast cann, and sit down again.  If you've timed it right, you'll still get the same regen of having sat for the full tick, even though you spent part of the tick standing.  This technique will give you the biggest possible regen of hp and mana for that time period.  Don't get up until you see the health and mana bars jump again, and then repeat.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Spell School Specialization
<BR>
<BR>
At level 30, you can specialize in one school of magic, which improves your skill in that school.  If you plan on playing more in groups than soloing, choose alteration.  A good 80% of your spells are in this category, including all your heal spells.  If you plan to solo more, you could pick conjuration, because your DoTs are largely conjuration spells, but I would still say choose alteration, because you won't always be soloing, and there are so few spells that use conjuration for you.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Soloing Shaman
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, you can solo your whole career if you wish to.  Soloing and grouping both have their rewards, and you should be adept at both if you are to reach your full effectiveness as a shaman.  If you solo a lot, you should consider getting equipment that gives you higher stamina (which improves your hitpoints) and higher armour class (which lessens the impact of hits from mobs).  You should also be trying, in the long run, for a 200 wis with the highest armour class possible, all in the same set of gear.  You will also want gear that increases your resistances and mana, if possible.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pet
<BR>
<BR>
At level 29, you get the spell Befriend Animal.  While not a true pet spell, this spell will give you your first experience with having a pet.  Remember that your pet is not particularly strong, but with buffs, he can be very very useful to have around.  At level 34 you get your Companion Spirit, which is your first true pet.  Remember, your pet spells, other than high level drop spells, come from the barbarian village in West Karana.  (And in case you didn't know, your vision spells generally come from the gypsy camps.)
<BR>
<BR>
The first thing you need to know is that you will have to judge when it is appropriate to bring up a pet and when it is not appropriate.  Typically, if you have little experience with pets, you will not want to bring up a pet in a dungeon with your group until you've soloed in an outdoor zone with your pet.  Once you've mastered soloing with a pet in an outdoor zone, try grouping with a pet in an outdoor zone.  After that is soloing in an indoor zone, and then grouping in an indoor zone.
<BR>
<BR>
Dungeons can be tricky for your pet because of pathing problems.  The pet that runs after a fleeing mob can bring back all sorts of its friends.  In some places, it is never appropriate to bring up a pet.
<BR>
<BR>
The most important commands are '/pet attack' and '/pet back down'.  You may also want to make a hotkey for '/pet get lost' in case your pet gets into trouble.  If you can't get your pet to back down, you may have to get rid of your pet.  Remember you have to be in range to give the command.  If you are level 29 or higher, invis yourself to kill your pet if you can't do it any other way.
<BR>
<BR>
Two other pet commands that are useful are '/pet guard me' (when you want it to follow you) and '/pet guard here'. The command '/pet guard here' is very useful when you're in a dungeon with pit traps, because Woofie will know exactly where to come back to if he accidentally drops down.  Remember that your pet could aggro mobs on his way back, particularly in a dungeon setting.
<BR>
<BR>
If your pet is just lost and you don't know where he is, at level 44 you get a summon pet spell which can call Woofie to your side.  If you cast the spell and he's engaged, you'll receive a message that Woofie is the 'focus of something's attention.'  In that case, invis yourself to kill Woofie.
<BR>
<BR>
Always let your group know in advance if you're bringing up a pet.   They may have a good reason for not wanting a pet there.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Equipment
<BR>
<BR>
There are three pieces of equipment that every shaman wants and should get eventually.  You'll be waiting a while for these, but even so, you need to know about them.
<BR>
<BR>
1.  Fungi Tunic - effect is fungal regrowth.  It's a high level regeneration spell, always on, that stacks with all other regeneration effects you have going.  Imagine what this does to your mana output when you're canning.
<BR>
<BR>
2.  Spear of Fate - your epic.  Besides amazing stats, it also has a right click DoT called Curse of the Spirits which does approximately 1300 points of damage to your mob over 2 minutes, manafree.
<BR>
<BR>
3.  Jaundiced Bone Bracer (no iksar, sorry).  This bracer has right-click effect Winter's Roar, our 270 point cold DD.  Also mana-free.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
General Notes for Everybody
<BR>
<BR>
1.  Max your Sense Heading and remember that clouds always travel west.<BR>
2.  Figure out how to use /loc.  You won't always be able to see the clouds.  You will use this lots.  You may as well get used to it.<BR>
3.  Max out your swimming.  Mobs can kill you in the water too.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Special Notes for Barbarian Shamans
<BR>
<BR>
1.  DON'T do the Hammer of Justice Quest.  It's not worth the time or effort, and the hammer isn't very good.<BR>
2.  DO the Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal Quest.  You can do it at level 5 or so, and it gets you not only a decent neck item that acts as a light source.  Also, if you right click the necklace as you're wearing it, it will summon a magic hammer with decent stats for your level.  You can then use it to kill magical creatures that aren't affected by normal non-magical weapons (ghouls and willowisps when you're a bit higher level).
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Finally, if you want to be a successful shaman, NEVER do these things
<BR>
<BR>
1.  NEVER refuse slowing duties.  Your slows are the best in the game and will save your healer, which might be you, a boatload of mana.<BR>
2.  NEVER cast Talisman spells on enchanters.  It messes up their Shield line of spells and they'll yell at you.<BR>
3.  NEVER cast a DoT on a mezzed mob.  The mobs will break mez and kill your enchanter.  Messy.<BR>
3.  NEVER tank if you're low on mana (well unless everyone else is dead, at least).  You're not there to hit things unless your group is buffed and healthy, your mob is slowed and you're at full mana.  If you qualify, let your group know that you're FM and going for weapon skill.  In a group, a 'battle shaman' is about as silly as an 'enchantatank'.
<BR>
<BR>
4.  NEVER ignore your offensive/defensive and weapons skills.  When you solo, make sure you're in there hitting and being hit (without dying of course) at least some of the time.  Those skills may save your life later.  For that matter NEVER ignore your spell schools or your specialization.  Spend time practicing, even if you think you'll never use the skill.  You will use it, eventually.
<BR>
