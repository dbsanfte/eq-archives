<tr> 
<td width='80%'><p>Here is all the relevant details on current targets in the Plane of Sky that
I’ve been compiling over the past few months. All the info up to Drake Isle is
complete. Here it is, the Plane of Sky.</p>
<p><b><u>Key Master Isle</u></b></p>
<p><b>Thunder Spirits</b> (8 of them on Key Master Isle, level 50) Look like
Faeries, they hit for up to 160 and will proc 'Choke' on their target randomly,
which takes 10 str off of their target and does a small DoT. Relatively low HP,
AC, and Resists, they go down fairly quick. They randomly drop all types of
Tesseras, three Mini-Swords and three Rabbits Feet. Hand the Mini-Swords and
Rabbits Feet to Sirran the Lunatic to receive a Key of Swords and a Key of the
Misplaced, respectively.<br>
<br>
<b>Thunder Spirit Princess</b> (Boss on Key Master Isle, level 53) Looks like a
Faerie, she hits for mid 200s and will proc 'Choke' on her target. Moderate HP,
AC, and Resists. Usually empty, but will rarely have a piece of rare loot (Hast
Belt, etc). Her death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, upon giving
him a Mini-Sword or Rabbits Foot, will hand you a Key of Swords or a Key of the
Misplaced, respectively.</p>
<p><b><u>Azarack Isle</u></b></p>
<p><b>Azarack</b> (9 on Azarack Isle, level 53) Looks like an Imp from SolB,
they hit for up to 190 and proc a spell called Whirlbolt (Levitate, Root, 400
dmg DoT) on their target. 12k HP, moderate AC, and strange spell resists (one
half of the Azaracks are resistant to cold, the other half to fire). They can be
mezzed. They randomly drop all types of Disc quest items, and 1-3 Broken
Mirrors. Handing the Broken Mirror to Sirran the Lunatic will give you a Key
which will enable access to the Gorgalosk Isle. Killing the Place-Holder on this
island (distinguishable by the fact that it hits for 220 instead of 190) will
spawn the Protector of Sky, the boss of the island.<br>
<br>
<b>Protector of Sky</b> (Boss of Azarack Isle, level 55) A giant version of his
Azarack counterpart, he hits for 300+ and procs Whirlbolt (Levi, 400 dmg DoT) on
his target. High HP, AC, Resists. Drops one rare item (Haste Belt, etc.), one
rare quest item, and 4 Broken Mirrors. His death triggers the spawn of Sirran
the Lunatic, who, upon giving him a Broken Mirror, will give you a Key that will
enable access to Gorgalosk Isle.</p>
<p><b><u>Gorgalosk Isle</u></b></p>
<p><b>Gorgalask</b> (~ 4 on Gorgalosk Isle, level 54-56) Looks like a Gorgon
(tentacles coming off the head), they hit for low 300s, and will proc a long
stun spell on their target. High HP AC Resists. Usually drops one Animal
Figurine, and one quest item (mainly globes). Handing the Animal Figurine in to
Sirran the Lunatic will give you a Key that will let you access the Pegasus
Isle. Enrages towards the end of fight.<br>
<br>
<b>Sprited Harpie</b> (~ 4 on Gorgalosk Isle, level 54-56) Looks similar to a
Gorgon/Gorgalask (but has no tentacles on its head), they will hit for low 300s,
have a low level necro pet, a 5-minute charge of Harm Touch, and will cast/proc
Fear, Mez, Cascading Darkness on their target. High HP AC Resists. Usually drops
one Animal Figurine.<br>
<br>
<b>Watchful Guard</b> (5 on Gorgalosk Isle, level 55-56) Looks similar to an
Evil Eye, will hit for low 300s, has an Enchanter pet, will cast Enchanter DD,
an AoE mass dispell, and an AoE Gravity Flux (seems to cast this off and on,
some raids they will Grav Flux, others they won't) on its opponents. High HP AC
Resists. Usually drops one Animal Figurine, and one quest item.<br>
<br>
<b>Gusts of Wind/Crystalline Cloud</b> (5 on Gorgalosk Isle, level 53) Looks

Attack (Stun) on its opponents. Low to Moderate AC HP Resists. Usually drops one
Animal Figurine, and one quest item.<br>
<br>
<b>Shimmering Meteors</b> (5 on Gorgalosk Isle, level 55) Looks similar to will
o' wisps, but red in color, they will hit for low to mid 300s, and cast the
spell Knockback (target gets thrown backwards, away from the Meteor. Always
fight inside the temple, or you will get thrown off the Isle). High HP AC and
Resists. Usually drops one quest item and possibly research materials.<br>
<br>
<b>Avenging Gazer</b> (Mini-Boss of Gorgalosk Isle, level 59) Similar to
Watchful Guards, it hits for mid to high 300s, and casts the same spells as a
Watchful Guard. Very high HP AC Resists. Usually drops one Animal Figurine, and
a better chance of receiving an item (Haste Belt, etc).<br>
<br>
<b>Heart Harpie</b> (Mini-Boss of Gorgalosk Isle, level 58) Similar to Sprited
Harpies, she hits for mid to high 300s, and casts the same spells as a Sprited
Harpie. Very high HP AC Resists. Usually drops one Animal Figurine, and a better
chance of receiving an item (Haste Belt, etc).<br>
<br>
<b>Gorgalosk</b> (Boss of Gorgalosk Isle, level 60) Looks like a Gorgalask, she
hits for mid to high 300s, and casts the same spells as a Gorgalask. Very high
HP AC Resists. Drops 4 Animal Figurines, one rare item (Haste Belt, etc), and
one rare quest item. Her death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who,
when you give him an Animal Figurine, will give you a key to the Pegasus Isle.
Enrages towards the end of fight.</p>
<p><b><u>Noble Isle</u></b></p>
<p><b>Bladestorm</b> (2 on Noble Isle, level 59-60) Looks like a cloud of
swords, they hit for low to mid 300s and proc a spell that saps their targets
Stamina. High HP, AC, and Resists. Usually empty, but will rarely have an item
(Haste Belt, etc). They guard Noble Dojorn. Enrages toward the end of fight.<br>
<br>
<b>Noble Dojorn</b> (Efreeti Boss of Noble Isle, level 63) Looks like an Efreeti,
he hits for ~350, casts an AoE DD spell, and has a DD random proc. VERY high HP
AC and nearly 100% Resists. Drops Efreeti quest items (Efreeti Staff, Efreeti
2-handed Sword, etc), Efreeti armor, as well as random rare items (Haste Belt,
etc). His death triggers the spawn of the Overseer of Air, on the Pegasus Isle.</p>
<p><b><u>Pegasus Isle</u></b></p>
<p><b>Soul/Essence Harvester</b> (6 on Pegasus Isle, level 52) Looks similar to
a Griffon or Pegasus, respectively, hits for high 200s and casts
Whirl-till-you-Hurl (stun that spins you in place). Moderate HP AC Resists.
Drops a quest item (mainly Statuettes), and up to 4 Bird Whistles. Its death
triggers the spawn of TWO Soul/Essence Carriers:<br>
<br>
<b>Soul/Essence Carrier</b> (Two to each Soul/Essence Harvester, level 54)
Exactly like the Soul/Essence Harvester, except they have higher HP AC Resists
and hit harder. Drops a quest item. Its death triggers the spawn of ONE
Soul/Essence Tamer:<br>
<br>
<b>Soul/Essence Tamer</b> (One to each Soul/Essence Carrier, level 56) Exactly
like the Soul/Essence Carrier, except they have even higher HP AC Resists and
hit for around 300. Drops a quest item. (Now its dead =P ) The death of the
Place-Holder (there are two on this island, one Griffon and one Peg PH) will
cause the Keeper of Souls, the boss of the island, to spawn. Enrages towards the
end of fight.<br>
<br>
<b>Keeper of Souls</b> (Boss of Pegasus Isle, level 60+) Looks like a giant
Pegasus (the size of a dragon, in fact), hits for 400+, casts a stun spell, and
Death Touches. Drops one rare item (Haste belt, etc.), one rare quest item, and
up to 4 Bird Whistles. Its death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who,
when given a Bird Whistle, will give you a Key enabling access to the Spiroc
Isle. Enrages towards the end of fight.<br>
<br>
<b>Overseer of Air </b>(Efreeti Boss of Pegasus Isle, level 63) Looks like an
Efreeti, he can hit for up to 750, casts an AoE DD, randomly procs a DD, and
Death Touches. He also dual wields daggers which need to be disarmed at the
beginning of the fight or he'll be able to quad attack. Drops Efreeti quest
items. His death triggers the spawn of the Hand of Veeshan on the Butterfly
Isle.</p>
<p><b><u>Spiroc Isle</u></b></p>
<p><b>Spiroc Arbiter, Banisher, Caller, Walker, Expulser, and Revolter:</b><br>
(6 on Spiroc Isle, level 52) Look like colorful Aviaks, they hit for 200 and
cast Lightning, an unresistable AoE, Blind, and Root. Drops Spiroc feathers as
its main quest item. Each of these Rooks are tied together in pairs (Arbiter
&amp; Banisher, Caller &amp; Walker, Expulser &amp; Revolter), and these pairs
are in turn associated with the Vanquisher that roams around them (they roam
around their individual ‘houses’ in these pairs). The associated Vanquisher
must be killed before the pairs of Rooks can be killed, otherwise the Rooks will
respawn. The Rooks can be mezzed quite easily.<br>
<br>
<b>Spiroc Vanquisher</b> (3 on Spiroc Isle, level 58) A bit tougher than the
Rooks, Spiroc Vanquishers wander near to its associated Rook pairs. These must
be killed before the Rooks can be killed. They drop 8 Noise Makers that enable
access to Bzzazzt Isle. Enrages towards the end of fight.<br>
<br>
<b>Spiroc Guardian</b> (Mini-Boss of Spiroc Isle, level 60) A larger version of
his Spiroc counterparts, casts similar spells, and drops two quest components.
It hits for up to 250. (Enrages? Can’t remember)<br>
<br>
<b>Spiroc Lord </b>(Boss of Spiroc Isle, level 63) An even larger version of the
Spirocs, this is the boss of Spiroc Isle. It hits for 350+, DTs, casts an
unresistable AoE spell, StoneSpiderStuns, Roots, and Blinds enemies. Drops 4
Noise Makers, as well as one rare item and one rare quest component. Its death
will trigger the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given a Noise Maker,
will give you a Key that will enable access to the Bzzazzt Isle. (Enrages?
Can’t remember)</p>
<p><b><u>Bzzazzt Isle</u></b></p>
<p><b>Bzzazzt</b> (3 on Bzzazzt Isle, level 50) Look like Wasps from newbie
zones, hit for 390, and cast Deadly Poison (1200 DoT) spell on target. Not very
magic resistant, and can be mezzed easily (and charmed too with some work). Each
Bzzazzt drops 8 Dull Dragon Scales, which enable access to Drake Isle. Main
quest items for this island are ‘Honey’-type items.&nbsp; (Note: All other
spawns after the initial Bzzazzt seem to be completely magic resistant except
for Lure-type spells, and ALL of the other spawns Enrage towards the end of the
fight, which sucks especially since they all hit for 600+ heh)<br>
<br>
<b>Left Bzzazzt </b>(when facing them from behind), when killed, spawns 2 level
55 Bazzzazzts (completely magic resistant and hit for 500s), and each of their
deaths will spawn a level 60 Bizazzt (hit for 700s and also completely
resistant) (Note: this is just like the spawn cycle for Pegasi/Griffons from
Pegasus Isle).<br>
<br>
<b>Right Bzzazzt</b> when killed, spawns 3 level 55 Bazzzazzts at once.<br>
<br>
<b>Middle Bzzazzt</b> when killed, spawns 1 level 55 Bazzzazzt, who's death
triggers the spawn of the level 60 Bzzt (a bixie, hits for 700s), who's death
triggers the spawn of the final boss, level 63 Bazzt Zzzt (another bixie, hits
for 850, DTs, has an island-covering AoE <i>disease</i> spell), for a grand
total of 2 Wasps, 2 Bixies for the Middle Bzzazzt. Its death will trigger the
spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given a Dull Dragon Scale, will give you
a Key that will enable access to the Drake Isle.<br>
<br>
(Note: The splits have a somewhat low aggro radius, and thus you can do CR on
the island with them spawned and get another try at them if you have a wipe-out.
Beware though, the splits have a despawn timer of between 60 and 80 minutes)</p>
<p><b><u>Drake Isle</u></b></p>
<p><b>Windrider, Heartsbane, Fatestealer</b> Drakes (10+ on Drake Isle, level
56-60) Wizard-type drakes that roam around the outside of the island.<br>
<br>
<b>Greater Sphinx </b>(8 on Drake Isle, level 54) Enchanter-type mob, assembled
in pairs around the temple in the middle of the island. Each of them DTs, making
pulling tricky (and we may have to fight multiple DTing mobs at once).<br>
<br>
<b>Undine Spirit </b>(8? on Drake Isle, level 53) Cleric wisp, found inside the
temple.<br>
<br>
<b>Sister of the Spire</b> (Boss of Drake Isle, level 63) A triggered spawn with
some sort of puzzle, likely hits for insane amounts of damage (1000+), DTs,
unresistable AoE and proccing DD.</p>
<p><b><u>Butterfly Isle</u></b></p>
<p><b>Eye of Veeshan</b> (1 on Butterfly Isle, level 60+) Looks like a
butterfly, supposed boss of the entire Plane of Sky, or at least the trigger for
something even bigger. Looks like a cute cuddly butterfly.<br>
<br>
<b>Hand of Veeshan</b> (1 on Butterfly Isle, level 60+) Triggered by the death
of the Overseer of Air, he’s the final step in the line of Efreetis.</p>
<p>There you have it folks. The last two islands’ info is a bit bare since
we’ve never actually been there...but that’ll change soon ;) And also note
that none of this info comes from ShowEQ, just from months and months of raiding
my favorite zone in EQ.</p>
