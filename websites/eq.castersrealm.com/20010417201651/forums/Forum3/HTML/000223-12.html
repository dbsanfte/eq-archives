</FONT><HR>You know, I was going to try to avoid posting to this thread, but I feel like I have to.<P>I want to talk about using pets and in particular about soloing.<P>No, I'm not particularyly ticked off that our pets don't attack faster with daggers.  Frankly, I always thought that was something of an explioit (ie, a bug that would eventually get fixed), and although I did take advantage of it a few times, it was by no means a regular occurence.<P>What I am ticked off about is all these people who are saying "You stupid enchanter, learn how to play your class, you shouldn't even be using your pets, and you shouldn't be soloing."<P>These people have really lit a fire under me tonight.  They A) Have never played an enchanter for any significant amount of time, B) play an enchanter but get powerleveled and twinked by their friends, or C) have played an untwinked, unpowerleveled enchanter, and the reason they don't see the same problems I do is that the stupid random number generator has been giving them all my good rolls and me all their bad.<P>On soloing:  I hate to solo.  I absolutely despise it.  I think soloing does nothing but bring out the worst in the game.  But you know what?  Probably 3/4 or more of my entire character's life has been soloing, and probably 90% of all of my experience gain has come from soloing.  Why is that, Myrrn?  Why do you solo so much if you hate it?  Answer?  Because 90% of the time I don't have any choice!  I spend hours and hours at a time sometimes asking, no, begging, for a group to take me.  Generally, the times when groups really want an enchanter are in very high mob count situations, where an enchanter is a requirement.  But guess what?  These situations are the exact ones that have made most of my experience gain come during solo times.  Because these situations require near-perfection out of everybody in the group, and frankly, there just aren't that many groups that are that good around.  Yes, I've been in a couple, but very few, so either there just aren't that many, or they all already have their pet enchanters, and want nothing to do with me.<P>On pets:  Guess what, if I'm soloing, I need a pet, and I need a good one.  Once upon a time, I could solo yellows and even a rare red with a pet, but now I'm starting to have trouble with blues, and every once in a while a green will get the best of me, even with a fully buffed pet.  Don't give me that bs about soloing with charm.  Soloing with charm not only requires practically perfect circumstances (2 mobs of near the same level at the same place at the same time), but it is nearly a death wish as well.  Yes, I love charm, and when I can find groups, I make quite frequent use of it.  But quit trying to tell me that it's the silver bullet that makes soloing easy, because all that tells me is that you either don't know what you're talking about or you're the one that's been stealing all my good random number streaks.<P>On a closing note, I saw somebody say "welcome to the same game melee classes have been playing all along", and I just had to laugh.<P>Because, you see, just last night, while I was in my second hour of asking for a group and attempting to do a bit of soloing (which basically consisted of fighting near the zone and zoning when my pet died and I was out of mana, I don't think I killed even one single mob in the entire hour), I watched a warrior (same level as me) solo things that made mincemeat of me, even with a pet.  And we're not talking soloing just one and then resting for 20 minutes, we're talking taking 3 or 4 in a row before having to rest.  So don't give me that bs either, because I'm not hearing it.<P>Do I love playing an enchanter?  Absolutely.  Because when things go well, they go very well.  I just wish "when things go well" was a little more often.  Have I cancelled my account once already for almost 3 months, and am I on the verge of cancelling it again, because of the utter frustrations of "when things don't go so well"?  Absolutely.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000276&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I personally feel all the players should take some time away from Everquest.<P>Not because people take it too seriously, or complain their favorite race/class is too weak compared to others... but because Verant needs to fix everquest properly.<P>Let's face it, these types of changes are done in beta, not final release.  I would love to see their faces if every single "customer" stopped playing within a week.<P>Think they would really crack down on these issues that have haunted the game for almost a year?  I quit playing EQ, sold my account, and figured that would be that... barely 1 month after Everquest was released.  I had hoped it had changed... it has not.<P>Those bastards do not deserve our money, nor do they have a right for it.  Would be nice to prove it to them, that's for damn sure.<P>A level 50 Necromancer pet killing a level 50 warrior.  Does anyone see anything wrong there?  Yet Abashi is pleased with how the pets are.

</FONT><HR>Re: Rmulawa's post<P>I have to agree with a number of things that you said, particularly about the strength debuff - I think a monk pointed out that buffing stats like agility and strength do almost nothing, so the reverse would be likely to be true that debuffing them would be just as useless.   I stick to the Slowdown spells (Languid Pace and mostly Tepid Deeds, as by the time I've gotten Shiftless Deeds to stick the fight is over..) and the DOT line.<P>(the dot does 750, not 500, damage versus monsters, the 500 was probably taken from casting it on oneself which gives PvP damage which is only 66% or whatever)<P>Nevermind that these debuffs aren't much use when the damage saved is like a quarter bubble, since the battle is over almost before it begins thanks to other classes.<P>Our only worthwhile spells in most fights at higher level are basically restricted to Tashania, Clarity, Int/Wis buffs and Swift.<P>Anything else is too slow, too weak or too resistable to be useful. (I don't think you'll stop that overpull in the Plane of Hate with Mesmerization somehow)<P>To all the people who say we could still level back in P3 or other things like that -&gt; anything can level in EQ so long as it finds a party, and stays out of the fight while collecting experience.<P>To Senir -&gt; Enchanters were specially balanced to require the debuff - it's a curse for us, not an ability.  I've experimented with wizards, mages, clerics and druids and their resist rates are lower without debuffing than mine are with.<P>To whoever said "be thankful you have a pet" -&gt; Most other classes have pets or can get them somehow.  And those are real pets, that take commands !  Not charmed creatures who run away when faced with difficult odds, or animations who won't listen to anything you say and wreck croud control with an uncanny skill.<P>About mage pets -&gt; Watched a fight vs. a seafury with my 52-hitting blue pet and a mage's green 44th summoned earth elemental, and I noticed that while my pet hit harder (once in the whole fight) the earth elemental hit much more often, and for more damage overall too.<P>About melee classes being beaten by pets-&gt;That does need to be looked at.<P>About enchanter downtime-&gt;sure I can recover mana faster than most other classes, but it takes a looong time to grow back from half health.. (you grow back one health every -other- second)  One root-resisting monster or something, and then might as well find a safe place to sit and leave the machine for fifteen minutes..<P>Not that I was a proponent of equipping our pets with high speed weapons to buff them up, but we are not the uber class everybody makes us out to be.  It would be very handy if our pets could be controlled though.<P>(Maybe I shouldn't have submitted that spell idea for enchanters to be able to transfer mana to other characters afterall.. It seemed okie - necros, masters of life and death transferring life to others, enchanters, masters of mind tranferring mana..)<P>---<BR>Kirenalin, 50th* Ranchantress<BR>Karana<P>* No guards, low levellers, or quests were harmed in the making of this level.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000279&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Although not an enchanter myself, I have known and hunted with a number of enchanters, and got to know their tactics and abilities well.<BR>I agree with Abashi's position that the enchanter is not a pet-class. However, I have to say that the dependence of the enchanters to their pets is far greater than that of the shadow knight, or the shaman.<BR>Shadow knights are primarily a melee class. They are self-sufficient with a sword and some armour, and can survive whether they cast spells or not (besides, they don't get spells till lvl 9).<BR>Shamans do not depend on their pet--ever--. They don't even get it till lvl 34, so it stands to reason that they 'must' have some other abilities to help them advance till that point.<BR>Enchanters on the other hand are weak, in both melee, and magic combat. Certainly they can charm, blind, stun...So? Once those spells are done, the enchanter will have to run, or die, as she's unable to do the damage needed to finish a kill. The few damaging spells they get are mana-hungry, and slow to cast. That's where their pet gets in, to keep them from harm while they cast.<BR>Sure, an enchanter is in his best element in a group--I know I love having one in my group--but does that mean they have to be helpless without one?<BR>Abashi says that Enchanters were not compensated because they could make their pets faster...<BR>Abashi, with all due respect, I think you're a little mixed up here...<BR>On one hand you talk about how each class has to be good at what they specialize in... So necros get pets, strong pets, with spells...They get the ability to heal those pets, and to buff them as well. Because that's what 'they specialize in'.<BR>Well, enchanters specialize in buffing and crowd control. They specialize in making things faster (or should we take Alacrity out of the game too, because it makes monks too fast?). Their pets cannot be commanded like Necro pets can. They cannot be healed by the enchanter. They have half the hit points and the armour class of other classes' pets. All they get--Wow!--are the (mana-costly, and of short duration) speed buffs that the enchanter can give. And not like those spells are specifically 'pet-spells'. They are the same spells the enchanter will cast on a Necro's pet, or on the monk or warrior that is tanking.<BR>'That' is the enchanter's specialty. Why should they be nerfed because of it?<BR>Let the enchanters be a viable class.<BR>You want to take away their pets? Then give some compensation for it. Make the charm spells harder to resist, or harder to break. Give them fixed duration, rather than random. Give the enchanter some way to do damage, in an effective way.<BR>That's my point of view.<P>Mythal Darkfyre<BR>Wizard, Innoruuk.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000281&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Verant nerfed our pets?  I don't care, they sucked so bad they were impossible to use anyway.  Haven't used one since I gave up soloing at level 16.  I was sick of having my pet die and me along with it.  Took me 20 days /play time to get up to level 16 (this was also before they halved exp loss upon dying)<P>After I gave up soloing, it took me 25 days /play time to make it from lvl 16 to level 44.  Enchanters were not meant to solo.  They just were not.<P>I hear people talk about soloing above 20 with ENC's all the time, well... either they have SoW and are kiting, or are lying.<P>Anyway, thats not why I'm posting this, like I said, I don't give a sh*t about the pets.  What concerns me is all the new spells the Necro's are getting in compensation for Verants screw up.  I want Group Clarity, an AE mez improvement, and Group AUGMENTATION!<P>Once you hit 44, you will be spending all your time and wasting all your mana BUFFING BUFFING BUFFING.  Clarity the group, Insight the WIS casters, Brillance the INT casters, Aug the weaker folk, Celerity the tanks, Resist Magic everyone (Clerics say they are too busy with the other buffs), Arch Shielding (thank Tunare that one is self only).  rinse, wash, repeat.  I'm not knocking this process, ENC's have great buffs and I enjoy passing em out, but comon!  Make it easier for us Verant!<P>AE mez (lvl 16) spell is without question the best spell in the game, for ANY class.  Any Enchanter worth his salt will be unable to count the amount of lives saved with this spell.  In fact, I hesitate to talk about it cause I'm afraid Verant will nerf it if they ever knew how good it was.  I can keep 6 white or yellow mobs frozen in their tracks with a 200 CHA with this spell.  But I usually get one or two resists each cast, so I have to chain cast it til I get all six. (thank goodness no recast time on it)  Then med for 5 secs, and start chain casting it again til I get all 6.  The tanks and nukers may take five min's or more to kill em all and I have to waste alot of mana to keep doing that.  An upgrade to the spell would be very welcome.<P>-Ethandrin<BR>Lvl 44 Enchanter Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000282&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Why even bother giving us a pet after that last nerf, especially with no compensation and for those of you who say the enc pet did suck you are very well mistaken, it had very few hps but could deal out massive amounts of damage, whereas the other classes had massive amounts of hps and could deal out significant damage.

</FONT><HR>Actually, most of the new necro spells just suck.  So much mana is lost in the "group-friendly" spell casting that it's not even worth it.  The only two spells that are even worth buying are leach and that lev 20 hp transfer spell.  Heart flutter is resisted so damn much that I didn't even bother with it most of the time at lower levs, although I'm not sure if the lev 44 spell is the same.<P>IMHO, Verant has taken away a major perk for necros and enchanters and given a completely pointless group of spells in return.  I agree that the mana transfer spells should have been given to the enchanter class, but they're not all that good to begin with.  <P>Couldn't Verant come up with spell idears that would actually make people _want_ to group with necros such as making dead man floating part of a series, the ability to enchant weaps that will proc vs-undead spells (probably should go to enchanters or clerics...), or even the ablility to reanimate fallen mobs, and then transfer 'ownership' of that mob to a fellow group member?<P>However, for low level types, this is somewhat of a blessing.  Take, for example, any lev 1 necro (4th lev magician).  Give that pet a rusty halberd, and you have instantly transformed that normally weak pet into an exp generator from HELL!!  Hehe just felt like putting this in... having a lev 1 pet that hits for 20 and has a normal delay just kicks ass.  Again, however, the enchanters can't take advantage of this.<P>Maybe we should all make enchanters and follow the GMs around casting sentinel... they might at least pay attention.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000285&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hello everyone, if you are reading this now, it means I am not as incompetant as I look.  Anyway, in regards to the enchanter nerf, I being a necro myself, feel it unfair to the fledgeling enchanters. I am QUITE pleased with the new spells yadda yadda but I too feel that balance in ways has been restored but ultimately the same. I have always felt that necros and enchanters were about even, given the necro DoTs and the enchanter debuffs and on, but now I almost feel guilty about how the patch has affected so many adversly. I feel that either they fix the whole pet thing for enchanters exclusively, or they make the speed increasing spell available at earlier levels. I probably do not know what I am talking about (to tell the truth I have never PLAYED an enchanter) but from what I have read (and that is a lot) and what I hear are the complaints, they seem only logical and fair. Now I know that it is nearly impossible to have ALL the classes equal, in EVERY way, but I think this case stands out like a sore thumb...mainly because of all the complaints and of all of the people joining together against it. I have an enchanter friend myself and he is less than pleased too. Well, my complete lack of paragraphs and re-emphasis of the same thing over and over has lingered long enough. Just thought I would share an opinion.<P>Shakan, of Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000286&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

They nerfed an entire class and yet they don't care, necro's get compensation, we don't, as if we didn't already have the crappiest line of DD's and nerfed Dot's now we have pets we can buff to make them almost as fast as they were.

</FONT><HR>For those who claim that an Enchanter needs an unnerfed pet to reach higher levels, I can easily attest that I have earned practically none of my experience with an animation that had a dagger. At level 5 with an animation of the same level (daggerless) I managed to kill 5 blue orc centurions. Yes, I got incredibly lucky with resists on Color Flux and Mesmerize. But I did it. If you are patient, you can actually continue to fight level 8-9 monsters until level 12, when you get Charm. Yes, it is VERY slow and VERY boring, but that is what nearly all melee classes have in store unless they group. At 12 we get Charm, which is like many of our spells in that it is weak sometimes and strong others. Enchanters are a hair-trigger class, from my experience. If everything goes right or mostly right, they can have incredible power. If everything goes wrong or mostly wrong, they will do nothing or even get their entire group killed. That is the choice you make in playing an Enchanter, having wildly varying power. Melee classes are very consistent, but they can never rise to meet a situation that would overpower them. The Enchanter at least has the chance to. Anyway, at 12 we also get Choke, Languid Pace, Ebbing Strength, and Whirl, all of which I have used and enjoyed. I still do not understand why Whirl is so bad, as my average duration on that spell is around the 10 second mark. Assuming the monster attacks every 1.5 seconds, that is 6-7 attacks that get blocked, not counting bashes. On an orc legionnaire, they seem to do around 26 to me, 14 or so to a tank. So the tank is being saved 14*6 or 84 damage, without misses. The cleric has to heal 84 less damage. Can a cleric heal 84 damage with the 55 mana it takes to cast Whirl? Between Tashan-Color Flux-Whirl-Color Flux  I have had a monster not attack at all. I have on occasion had Whirl last the whole rest of the fight. How is this spell broken? I haven't even noticed particularly bad resists on it. Languid Pace seems to resist far more. Somehow I have managed to make it up to 16, nearly 17, without taking advantage of the dagger trick, so it must be possible. And as for nobody wanting an enchanter in a group before Clarity, this hasn't been the case for me. I generally have no trouble picking up a group when I want one, and I have cultivated several friends I play with regularly from the groups I have been in. I have never met a group that turned me down because I was an enchanter. The only time I had difficulty gaining a group was between 10 and 12. I will admit that was a difficult time for me, and I took several breaks of more than a week because of frustration. But I didn't use daggers, and I made it through. Should the game not be frustrating? Not in my opinion. For the game to be worth devoting hours to, it should either have a really great plot (Not present here), or present a long series of obstalces to overcome. Nothing would please me more than a game in which it took a minimum of 2 years of playing time to reach the maximum level. On this issue, I am doubtless in the minority. So perhaps I have more patience than most Everquest players. In any case, my philosophy is: since everybody complains of being bored or useless at level 50, why be so concerned with how fast you reach it? Since the destination is the end of the game, why not enjoy the journey? As for the pet class issue, how about the following analogy: Clerics are the primary healing class. Druids and Shamen are secondary healing classes. Paladins, Rangers, and Bards are tertiary healing classes, because of their limited mana or limitations of speed of healing magic. Likewise, Magicians are the primary pet class, Necromancers are the secondary pet class, and Enchanters, Shadow Knights, and Shamen are tertiary pet classes. I don't feel Enchanters are broken in any way. There are a few things that would be really great if they were done, several of which have been mentioned in this thread. But I see nothing that makes the Enchanter class "unplayable".<P>Althien of Erollisi Marr<P>"My class is broken?

</FONT><HR>Enchanter pets whern't much to begin with, so nerf away... no big loss. At lvl 50 I never use pet because in the planes all they seem to do is waste mana, and cause trains geting everyone killed. Thats not to say they can't be used in the planes, sometimes the pet is nice because it gives u a little extra time to root or mez some other mob, but mana cost and fizzle rate just isn't worth it, when the pet dies every pull. Really, only time I ever use it is when camping lower lvl mobs for items I want for friends, or some other character of mine. The Enchanter Animation is great for taking out green trash mobs, thats it. For mobs = lvl at 50 it is about as useless as the charm spell. I have a screenshot of allure resisted 8 times in a row, mob coned blue, charisma is 205, non-charmable mob's are *B.S.*<P>If there was a message that gave you about 5-12seconds warning *based on lvl* when your charm duration was about to run out, AND charm actually connected 25% of the time. I would be in 7-th heaven.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000290&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>This whole ordeal isnt about pets anymore.. its about how enchanters are ignored when they finally want to find out what is happening. And what the intent for our class is. <P>We've been promised so much over the last few monthes to make our class more unique. Only to make these new ability both useless, and not even used by the encahtners casting them. Instead we've had aspects of our class given away.<P>Im all good to go for Not playing my enchanter for a week.. its getting frustrating anyways..<P>Anyone still want to do the monk-type thing and do a pile of level 1 encahters dual'ing outside felwiht ?<P>note: Tonite i played my ranger, and the level 20 necro pet was outdamaging BOTH me and the warrior in our group combined. And we were both duel weilding.

</FONT><HR>It's obvious to me that Necro's are just Verrant's favorite class.<BR>With any other class, if you can solo a gamble to tomb, you are nerfed into oblivion.  Example, the kiting that duids where doing.  Necros however, from lvl 4 on up, and kite and solo gambles and tombs.  Hell I started a necro and inside Blackburrow solo'd 3 gamble gnolls.  So what happens when we make a big fuss about their ability at killing reds?  They have a big debate on whether they should nerf the necros or not.  Once they DO nerf the pet, look at what they do?  Quote: "These new lines of spells will make the Necro more group friendly".  ????<BR>So because of this nerf, they beef the pet up with spells that LIFE TAP and they give the class 8 to 10 new spells???<BR>Bloody hell this is ridiculous.  Abashi already stated that his main char is a necro.  The only thing that verrant found objectionable is that a necro could solo the Shin lord room with no threat to dying.  Well...spiffy.  It took them this long to act on it, because people didn't raise a fuss about it till now..otherwise they would have been happy to let it slide on through.<BR>Sigh.  This type of crap is really upsetting.  I can't wait till Neverwinternights comes out and I can divulge myself of this addiction with EQ.  It's been great, but I hate to be talked down to and continually disappointed.  <P>Oh, one more thing, has anyone else noticed that in Verrants eyes, mid-level means 35 to 40?  The "Mid-level" paw that came on line for example?  I wish they would not treat the game as if Kunark where already added.  What they are doing is balancing for the expansion.  It's as if Kunark was to be here the whole time, so they itemize and gear mid-level to 35 to 40.  Ever taken a look at teh levels of some of the monsters in the "Mid-Level" class specific armor quests?  Last I looked, trying to get the ingots out of Mistmoor at lvl 25 is suicide even in a group.  Care to take a full fledged Griffon on at 25?  Maybe if your party is 6 necro's your ok.....<P>Matriach</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000292&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think its a load of BS what happened in this patch, I have played both a Necro and an Enchanter, never got one to any high level status but even at lower levels its obvious.  With my level 4 gnomish necromancer who had squat for int I could destroy the entire Kobold camp in steamfont zone.  One lvl 4 necro and pet I could solo 3 level 3-5 Kobolds, with my AE and pet doing the damage I took down the highest one first and usually my pet kicked all their a$$es with no probs.  I played a Dark Elf enchanter, but it is pretty clear to me if i were to have attempted that I woulda been made into a corpse.  The pet just does not have the hp's at lower levels to compensate for necro pets.  Not to mention i can't tell his dumb a$$ to back off.  Just becuase my pet goes crazy and KS'es all of a sudden I'm the jerk becuase i can't tell my pet what to do.  I think pets need several changes.  We need the ability to command them, we need our pets to have more hp, and we need our charms and stuns to be resisted less and last longer.  I recently started a new enchanter on Karana, after this patch I think he will become un-playable due to the lack of the ability to solo or find a group that will take me when they can have a necromancer or magician.  What good is there in grouping with an enchanter who has no clarity, has no pet worth having around, has dot and stuns that gets resisted, and has no DD line of spells?<P>=(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000294&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Hmm a lot of replies and comments on the Necro/Enchanter nerf. Lots of ideas on how to improve the Enchanter class in general. I myself am not a enchanter, I am a wizard. I feel that my input on this matteris valid because I (not being a enchanter) see them as nothing more than worthless until level 34. At level 34 as you know the Enchanter gets the spell clarity, which being a wizard is very nice to have. I don't bother to group with enchanters at my level simply because as a fighting class they are worthless. The enchanter was designed to be a Economy based class, the problem is that to gain exp, one must kill, and to kill one must be able to effectivly damage the creature. Herein lies the problem, the Enchanter can't solo well and espically not with the crappyness of his pet. Being a Wizard I can sympathize with the difficulties of Soloing, but can't imagine what its like not being able to whip out 100 damage in 5 secs. IMO the enchanter is basically the b!tch of every other class. I would like to see a level 50 enchanter duel any other level 50 because frankly I haven't seen it happen, and it probably doesn't because everyone knows how crappy the enchanter is at fighting. So what can we do? Has the enchanter gone the way of trade skills and become obselete? I mean face it, the enchanter was put in EQ to have all his nifty little disguises, illusions and ablities of enchanting various items. But basically you follow a far more fruitless quest than all the other classes. The other classes gain more to buy equipment so they can kill more mobs and gain more exp. The enchanter is the best class in the game at money making, yet what need do they have of money? What are they going to buy for themselves that fullfills the same purpose as a Staff of Observer for a wizard, or a Executioner's Axe for a warrior? They have nothing. <BR>My solution: Clearly the enchanter is not a fighting class so focus more on the buffs/debuffs of it.<BR>Add in spells that will grant more AC to a character with names like Double Vision, the premise being that the mobs sees two of the character so it misses 30% more. Of course there would be more and less powerful versions of the spell as level dictates.<BR>Also give the enchanter the ability to add minor damage and quickness buffs to the weapons of other characters, thus 'enchanting' them with magic! <BR>Basically make the enchanter wanted in groups by giving them party based effects. Give them the ability to EFFECTIVELY weaken enemies, don't give them a spell that would lower resistances/AC/Thac0, but then have the spell be highly resisted. I.e. That shaman spell that lowers resistance but is resisted 80% of the time, can't remember the name.<BR>And finally how about some illusions that will, Pull mobs similar to that of using a bow (Pulling only one monster not a train.) And give them Anti-Train spells. I remember when I played a illusionist way back in the days of AD&D I would create illusions of the monsters racial enemy and divert their attention that way. Why not do something similar with the enchanter, make a spell that would send the monster back to its home point, and forget the party. Once again resistances and more versions of this spell would be based upon level.<BR>Hope I've been of some insight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000295&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>why would an elemental get to use a weapon anyways? makes no sense, it gets its power from its natural elemental form, was just lazy programming by verant to make it dual weild even though it already had a balanced output of damage  (verant said we were all balanced not long ago). . . makes perfect sense that a skeleton can weid a weapon to its benefit or an ENCHANTED animation can weild a weapon better!<P>If they really cared about dual weild, then they wouldnt have taken the easy way out with the other NPCs .. . they considered them to be balanced for damage output as they are instead of giving them the proper dual weild and reducing damage output.  Just like two weeks or so ago they announced that we were all balanced as we were .. .. WTF! so they nerf balanced classes!!<P>you cant group at low levels becuase newbies dont understand enchanter crowd control. mid levels start to understand but are blinded by our manacrack and speedcrack. High levels want us only for very limited crowd control and clarity.<P>if you say we need no pet, we arent a pet class, then youve never played an enchanter or if you did, you played it ignorantly far from its full potential . . ..guess im supposed to just root and nuke like a wiz only with brutal DD and DoTs! . . . when used properly the pet added much to our abilities, i really dont understand why any enchanter wouldnt use one!<P>I need it for crowd control! it would (before the nerf) take a mob off me so i could mez (doesnt taunt off me now) . .  .IT DOESNT MATTER THAT IT HITS A MEZZED MOB . . THE MOB WILL STAY ON IT IF NOONE INTERFERES!<P>if you are camping a room in  dungeon the pet will not wander if you do not wander, so cast it after you start camping a room and recover it when you leave!  --  if it chases a mob out the room it makes no diff, that mob will attract other mobs anyways!<P>unless those showEQ people are right . .. our pets dont take meaningful xp in a group fight so why not have it there doing a little damage so that YOUR TANKS take less damage?<P>It makes perfect sense that ENCHANTERS who can cast QUICKNESS should be able to have the fastest pets. .  . yes they should be the weakest always were.<P>if verant really thought the dagger bonus was an exploit or bug, they would have removed it a year ago! theyve known about it all along! every web site tells you to give a dagger to your pet!<P>I am considering following the walk out ... and starting a new character named  ENCHANTERNERFPROTESTER if i can have a name that long.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000299&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 20 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-17.html">17</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-18.html">18</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-19.html">19</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-20.html">20</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000223&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000223&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
