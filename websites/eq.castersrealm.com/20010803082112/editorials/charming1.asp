    to be Prince Charming</font></b><font face='Arial'><small><br>
    <b>by Aaldin Dbrain</small></font></p>
    </b><p><font face='Arial'><small>The steps towards adulthood for the enchanter are rough
    indeed, but once achieved you aquire the tools to be one of THE most powerful classes in
    Norrath. One of the most interesting things about enchanters is that with their almost
    unwieldly large selection of spells, they can be played in numerous ways. For example,
    enchanters, despite the naysayers, are excellent soloers in my experience, far more than a
    wizard might be with his root and nuke strategy, the enchanter has a tool for every
    situation. Throughout my career as an enchanter I have solo'd everything from red con's to
    camps of blues. With a selection of nerfing spells that can make a red con into an even to
    a selection of crowd controls that can turn a fight against a camp from a 1 on 3 to two
    fights of 2 on 1, we can solo better than most. Despite that, don't solo. Truth be told,
    it's a little boring playing a multi-player game by yourself, and with no one to watch
    your back, the slightest misstep can mean dissaster. That is true with all classes
    however. Enchanters have been called a group class by many, and despite my position on how
    well they can solo, I would agree. Enchanters can truly shine in a group, but only a group
    that understands you and how you operate. For that to happen, you must first understand
    yourself.<br>
    <br>
    This article is related to one of the most useful and at the same time most dangerous of
    spells, Charm. It is such a useful spell, that an entire subgroup of enchanters is based
    around it. Prince Charming as I call it, is a specific type of enchanter who relies on,
    and uses that spell to it's utmost effect, and uses it often, in almost every fight. The
    ability to make an enemy your pet is unbelievably powerful, and can turn a losing fight,
    into an easy victory. But to do it, you have to do it right, and to rely on it, you have
    to devote yourself to it. The enchanter who does not do this will find charm to be a
    merely useful spell under certain circumstances, and a dangerous spell under most. To be
    Prince charming is more than just keeping charm memorized and using it if your animation
    dies, it means prefering use of that spell over any other strategy available to an
    enchanter, and as stated above Prince charming is only one of the many.<br>
    <br>
    To understand the Prince Charming, you must understand the value of time. Simply put, time
    is everything. Most people undertsand this to some degree, such as the value of a wizards
    nukes bringing down a creature quickly, or a heal spell giving you more time to finish
    your fight, but to a Prince Charming, it is THE most essential element in a fight. Your
    greatest enemy is not the monsters you face, but time. In fact, the monsters are merely
    your tools to get the job done. Time is your nemesis, take no prisoners. More on that
    later.<br>
    <br>
    Let us start at the beginning, the creation of your character. While many have said that
    Intelligence is your most important attribute, I would disagree. It IS important, but for
    Prince Charming it is secondary to Charisma. This also applies to the decisions that need
    to be made on what to wear to enhance what attribute. While an enchanter with higher
    intelligence will have more mana to shoot around, one extra resist on a mesmerize, charm,
    or lull will throw that bonus out the window, and it will cost you TIME. Saving mana isn't
    really an issue for the Prince charming, most of the time, you will have enough mana to do
    what needs to be done as long as you are in fact devoting yourself to the charm and not
    wasting mana on such frivolous things as DD's and Strength Debuff's. This, of course,
    applies ONLY to the Prince Charming. If you are spending your time in a fight throwing
    around damage spells and debuff's, and then getting in there and whacking away at them
    alongside your trusty animation, then don't both<br>
    er with charisma, you will find that more mana will serve you better. Disclaimer :
    Charisma is always my first choice, but not to the total neglect of other attributes. One
    needs to strike a balance between specializing in one area, and keeping the rest from
    being so bad that they get you killed, how far to go with this is always a personal
    choice.<br>
    <br>
    Now on to the tools, and no the spell Charm itself is not the only one that Prince
    Charming needs. The very first spell in Prince Charmings arsenal is Lull, which is later
    improved by Soothe at 8th and Calm at 20th. Lull itself you probably won't need, since at
    those levels you will be fighting mostly in the newbie areas where camps are rare. Soothe
    and higher, however, you will likely use quite often if you ever engage in taking on camps
    or dungeon crawling. While use of the spell can make a tough camp into an easy one, do NOT
    use it to turn an impossible camp into a manageable one, unless you have SoW and a zone
    close by :) The reason for this is resists, charisma helps here, but just one really bad
    resist can throw the whole camp into a frenzy. Not every resist will do this, but it only
    takes one bad one to get yourself killed. Use this spell with care when taking camps out.
    But camps aren't the only places where soothe and calm are useful. One of the things these
    spells can give you is time before a fight starts. Let's say you walk into a dungeon and
    find two guards at the entrance, simply charming one to fight the other can work, but a
    better way....a safer way, involves the use of soothe. Soothe one of them, mesmerize the
    second, tashan and THEN charm, this will virtually ensure that the charm lasts throughout
    the battle.<br>
    <br>
    The next spell the enchanter receives is Mesmerize. This spell has saved so many lives,
    and turned so many losing battles into easy victories, that I would have to say, even at
    level 20 it is ALWAYS in a spell slot. If you ever find that a pet is too powerful for you
    to finish off, a simple mesmerize can get him out of your face. Ah but there's another
    greatly overlooked spell, that is more personal than the mesmerize and not even noticed by
    many, Color flux. These two added together are the second in a series that give you time.
    Time to react, time to target, time to allow your party to finish off what it was doing
    before going on to the next. Just a few seconds wasted because your spell was interrupted
    WILL cost hp's and possibly lives. With Color Flux, you virtually eliminate having your
    next spell interrupted, and that next spell is usually a mesmerize, or charm, which will
    then give you even more time free from interruption and loss of hp's. One of the first
    skills that Prince Charming MUST learn is the colorflux combo. The easiest way to use this
    is with spell hotkeys, place Colorflux in the same hot key category as mesmerize, charm,
    and whatever else you might think you'll use right after colorfluxing. After hitting
    colorflux, rapidly hit the key containing the spell you really want, such as mesmerize.
    The instant it allows you to, the spell will go off, and the creature won't have time to
    interupt you before the effect takes place, but the timing here is very short, a split
    second too long will mean a loss of time as your spell is interupted.<br>
    <br>
    The next spell in your arsenal is Charm itself, this spell is really much more complicated
    than it appears at first. And in fact requires this entire article just to explain how to
    use it effectively :) This spell is not the last in your inventory of charming tools, but
    it is , of course the most instrumental one. I will get into the inticacies of using this
    spell a little later.<br>
    <br>
    Mesmerization. When you ever get a chance, GET THIS SPELL. It's one of the best time
    savers you will ever have. Second to none this spell gives you all the time you need to do
    what you need to do. It's like telling the world STOP, and they all do. Just be careful
    with it, mesmerizing yourself is very embarrasing. For that reason I keep endure magic up
    at all times, if you happen to accidentally stay near the range of the spell, which is
    quite large, or you have no choice, such as in a small room, resisting it is much more
    likely to occur. Should you get mesmerized, don't freak out, chances are good everything
    around you is just as frozen as you are, except your group members and the one they are
    fighting. When to use this spell requires a little knowledge on what you are fighting,
    sometimes it's fine to allow the extra creatures to attack for a few seconds while you use
    the cheaper mesmerize, or if you feel the fight will be a long one, enthrall. Against hard
    hitters though, the ones everyone who isn't grouped with you will freak out over, you want
    them stopped ASAP before they do any significant damage. If there's more than one in this
    situation it's often better to use mesmerization to give yourself that breathing room.<br>
    <br>
    Finally I will get to the only debuff Prince Charming ever uses. Tashan, and it's better
    counterpart, Tashani. These spells lower the magic resistance of the creature you are
    fighting, while it isn't always possible to tashan before a fight starts, the spells cast
    very quickly, use little mana, and will greatly enhance the duration and success of a
    charming attempt. As such, whenever possible, use this spell BEFORE charming, since a pet
    cannot have a debuff cast on it. The time spent on this short procedure will be time well
    spent, since it will save you the aggravation of having to recharm a pet more often than
    not.<br>
    <br>
    Those are the tools that Prince charming has available to him. These are NOT enough. To be
    truly effective there are skills, personal reflexes, and knowledge of the creatures in
    your area which must be learned. In no particular order, I will list these one by one, but
    before I do, I must explain the nature of what time means to Prince Charming.<br>
    <br>
    Before a creature becomes a pet, it is an enemy. Simple enough right? While you are
    fighting this enemy, you/your group is experiencing the loss of hp's, the loss of mana,
    and the danger of death from that source. When this creature is a pet, just the opposite
    is true. Your other enemies are losing hp's, your group is saving mana because the
    oppostion is falling faster, and your group is not taking any damage from your new pet.
    This is where time becomes crucial. One extra second where the wizard you intend to charm
    blasts a group-mate or yourself, and kills you is defeat. One extra second where the
    wizard blasts the last creature to death before the charm breaks and he turns on you, now
    out of mana, equals victory. The more time you save, the better your fights will go, all
    skills that you need to learn relate to time in one way or another.<br>
    <br>
    Targetting, a pain to learn how to do effectively, but a must for Prince Charming. In a
    fight you will often target multiple creatures, getting the correct one is crucial to
    success, and doing it quickly even more so. Get used to using hotkeys. Make two assist
    hotkeys, one will say simply /assist the other will be /assist &lt;designated targetters
    name&gt; the designated targetter is a person in the group that you assign to be the ONLY
    other player allowed to target a creature, all others must use assist. This ensures
    several things. One, the one everyone is hitting will fall faster, reducing the number of
    opponents. Two, they will not hit creatures you have mesmerized. Three, it reduces
    confusion, the one they are fighting will have less hp's than the rest. Simply put, if the
    creature has less than full hp's don't mesmerize it, and by all means DON'T CHARM it, or
    everyone will be sitting there scratching there heads wondering why they aren't attacking.
    This also means, if it has full hp's you are free to do as yo<br>
    u see fit, for whatever the situation calls for.<br>
    <br>
    The reason you make two hotkeys, is when a pet is charmed, you want it to fight what
    everyone else is fighting. That's why you have the designated targetter hotkey. You can
    also use the F# keys with the normal assist to get the job done, but in my experience, the
    fewer keypresses you have to do, the better, you have enough to do as it is. The second
    simple /assist is for those few situations where you want to target what something else is
    currently fighting, such as your new pet. Example situation, your party if fighting 4
    goblins. You are hit by several of them, so you target one that isn't damaged and then
    color flux, charm. You are then hit again, but by one of them that isn't being attacked,
    your new pet will now turn on this attacker, you don't want this normally, I'll explain
    why in a minute. So reflex's in action, while they're fighting throw a mesmerize at the
    last one, then as soon as that's finished hit F1 twice and assist, turn off attack,
    Mesmerize and /pet back off hotkey, /assist &lt;DT&gt;, /pet kill. Sounds complicated, but
    when you develop skills like this that whole sequence will take less than a second, not
    including the mesmerize casting time ;) This is one of the skills which are personal,
    having to do more with your ability as a player than on your characters abilities.<br>
    <br>
    When decided what your new pet will fight, always prefer him to assist your group rather
    than a different attacker. There are pro's and con's to this, on the good side of him
    fighting something else, two monsters are being damaged while you group is fighting a
    third, and I WILL allow this for a short time, as in the example above, since it leaves me
    with two fewer creatures to worry about, and more time to worry about the rest. However,
    the bad side is the fight will usually last longer, and when charm breaks you now have two
    half damaged monsters attacking you. If he instead assists the group, when charm breaks
    he'll be the only one attacking you, which is fine and quite simple to handle. The one the
    group is fighting will also fall faster, reducing the number of opponents, which is always
    a good thing.<br>
    <br>
    Which spell to use when, is another ability that only really comes with practice. To give
    some personal examples, with a fight against two wizard types, the first spell I throw out
    is mesmerization if they're close together since they're usually not next to me while
    they're casting those spells, then I pick one as a pet, tashani, charm, and tell it to
    attack the other wizard and watch them blast each other to bits. If I used mesmerize
    first, the second one will hit me with a nasty spell that could kill me (though I will do
    this if they aren't close enough for mesmerization to get both of them), if I try charm
    first, it could get resisted or not last long enough because I didn't tashan him. If I try
    to tashan and then charm, the extra time spent with the tashan while BOTH are attacking me
    is suicide. Another example would be against 2 regular hit and bash types. In this case
    I'd usually pick one out tashan while they're hitting me, then colorflux and charm.<br>
    <br>
    The recharm is another ability you need to get used to. Despite every effort to ensure
    that a charm is successful and long-lasting, do NOT depend on it doing so. In fact, a
    Prince Charming expects his charm to break at the worst time, ensure that there are no
    worst times. Recharming a pet, and doing it quickly, is an essential skill. Use the fact
    that charm is a mega taunt to your advantage. The creature now hitting you, used to be
    your pet, but you have another targetted. Hit esc, the next hit will be your old pet,
    colorflux, charm. Automatic, all calm, no sweat, this will be as natural an occurance in a
    fight as a wizards root. Get used to it, and you will learn to keep your head when it
    happens.<br>
    <br>
    When a fight is over and all you have left is that pet, now is the time to break the
    enchantment, NEVER bring a pet from one fight to another if you have another choice. Part
    of the greatness of charm is that it reduces your number of enemies and adds another
    member to your group, bringing a charmed pet from one fight to another is worse than
    simply using an animation, at least the animation will never turn on you. If your group
    needs to cast some healing spells let them do so, memorize Invisibility, and cast it on
    yourself when everyone is ready, as soon as the casting completes, target..hit colorflux
    mesmerize and let your group finish him off. I use Invisibility rather than Cancel Magic
    simply because cancel magic doesn't always work to cancel the charm, especially if your
    pet has a habit of buffing himself.<br>
    <br>
    One of the hardest skills to learn, isn't really a skill so much as it is simple knowledge
    of creatures and their capabilities. What you should charm when confronted with any given
    group of enemies is very important to how well the fight will go. There are rules you
    should follow, but they aren't written in stone, and change as your abilities develop. For
    instance when given a choice between charming a yellow con, or a blue con, I will usually
    charm the blue, simply because the charm is more likely to last through the entire fight.
    However if the yellow is a wizard type, and the blue is a tank, I will do the opposite.
    Why? The wizard will kill the tank much faster than the tank will kill the wizard, unless
    you're having a really bad day with the Random Number Generator, the tank should be dead
    before the wizard breaks the charm, and the wizard will likely be Out of mana or close to
    it, and be much easier to kill afterwards. This second option, charming the yellow con'd
    wizard, didn't really become available to me until I got to 20th level though, because of
    the added capablities granted by using sympathetic aura, the better magical items I have
    that also increase charisma, and the better tashani spell. Before that, charming a yellow
    was simply out of the question, it would break on average in less than 15 seconds. I
    imagine that soon, a low red will be within my reach as a good pet to rely on. I could go
    on and on with what to charm and what not to, but there's nothing that teaches better than
    simply trying it yourself and seeing what effects you can have. I have charmed a basilisk
    once, it was a fantastic pet. That is until it broke, and he turned me to stone, and
    gnawed me to death. This would fall into the category of
    charm-only-if-you-have-to-because-you-won't-be-able-to-recharm. This also applies to
    extremely fast hitters, the few who have a good chance of even interupting colorflux.
    Finally, don't use charm if it's your very last spell and it puts you out of mana. In that
    case use mesmerize and get your butt to safety. There are exceptions of course, there
    always are. Such as, you are meditating and get trained on with very little mana and half
    health, one good charm can keep them fighting your new pet until he's dead, leaving you
    free to run to the zone, this works in a desperate situation.......sometimes. Desperation
    always makes exceptions to the rules ;)<br>
    <br>
    My last piece of advice has to do with your memorized slots. What to pick is difficult in
    the extreme. There are so many choices available to an enchanter it can get mind-boggling.
    This is part of the reason why there can be completely different types of enchanters, the
    use of speed buff's and debuff's is extremely powerful, as can stacking several strength
    debuff's such as Choke, Enfeeblement and Disempower. To the Prince Charming you must
    decide what is most important to your style of play. To make it simple, remember, anything
    that will save you time in a fight, is worth having memorized. Let me give an example of
    what I have memorized in a dungeon crawl, 20th level. Color Flux, (I don't have colorshift
    yet, anyone on Prexus that has the left half of page 312 give me a /tell :-),
    Mesmerize(which I'll quickly switch to Enthrall if I realize a fight is going to take a
    long time), Mesmerization, Charm(switch for Invis when I need to break the charm),
    Tashani, Root (or sometimes Calm), Sanity Warp, Rune 1. Why the rune you may ask?
    Remember, ensure there is never a worst time for charm to break. When the fight has
    stabilized, you have everything under control, your group is systematically killing the
    creatures one by one and your pet is there blasting them away with them, if charm breaks,
    you want to be sure that you can survive long enough to recharm. So during those moments
    when you seem to have nothing to do, and your mana is high enough that you have little
    worry about running out any time soon, get your rune up, and damn the cost. You might have
    noticed that I have only one damaging spell memorized, and the simple truth is, I rarely
    use even that, but I like to have it handy just in case. They cost mana that you'll need
    for more important things, leave the damaging part to your pet and your group. If you're
    still not sure think of it this way, a wizard can do x dmg before he runs out of mana. By
    simply charming an NPC wizard, you can do the same damage, with less mana, AND keep that
    damage from landing on your group at the same time, making it really count as a heal also,
    preventative damage maybe. Which is more powerful? Would you rather keep your mana ready
    for the recharm if it becomes necessary, or spend the rest of your mana on blasting, and
    not have enough to recharm if you have to?<br>
    <br>
    I hope this helps all of those who have seen a Prince Charming in action, and never
    understood what it really took to be able to rely on it, after dying so many times
    themselves as a result of this spell. Once mastered, you will find the technique to be
    prefered over any other, at least in my experience. Take care, Prince Charming always has
    another wicked step-mother to do the dirty work for him.</small></font></td>
