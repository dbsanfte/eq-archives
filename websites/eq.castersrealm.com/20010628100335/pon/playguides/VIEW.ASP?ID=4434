  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p>Greetings fellow brothers and sisters in arms!<br>
<br>
Now I know the title of this strategy probably has many of you
guffawing and opening your mouths in disbelief. 'A
Paladin...Solo?' The Answer is yes.<br>
<br>
Many of you as you have leveled have at some point come across
certain 'dead zones' or your progression where you just can't
seem to get a group. This is generally attributable to the blief
that certain other classes are better tanks than we are; a highly
debatable point, but not the subject of my article. Once you've
passed level 35 it becomes that much harder to find groups who
favor Shadow Knights and Monks for their Feign Death abilities
and Rangers and Warriors for thier damage outputs.<br>
<br>
Inevitably if you want to get through some of the lonely periods
you are going to have to learn how to fight solo. Though many
feel that past a certain level a Paladin isn't capable of
fighting a blue con solo, this is FAR from the case. There are a
few general rules and strategies to follow and an arsenal of
spells that make us excellent at fighting the brave fight when
the odds are stacked against us.<br>
<br>
I'll try to break down strategies and places by spell ranks. It
is mainly our spells that determine new tools for soloing beside
our general melee strategies. Also, though humans, dwarves, high
elves, half elves, and erudites are capable of being Paladins and
dwell in different parts of Norrath, I will be basing my location
recommendations per my experience rather than by region for each
culture.<br>
<br>
LEVELS 1 - 8<br>
<br>
By far the easiest levels to solo of course, as most newbies are
indeed intended to progress through the first five levels all on
their own. Groups don't really become important until level 6.
Where you hunt at this level is totally dependent on what city
you started in. For erudites though I recommend that as soon as
you spawn and get your beginning gear you take the boat to Qeynos
and fight in it's newbie grounds. The Toxxulia forest is a very
difficult place to find prey, especially for a newbie Paladin
with no spells.<br>
<br>
Once you've hacked and slashed your opponents and run to the
guards when needing help a bunch of times, you'll soon find
yourself sitting at level 6 and wondering what to do with
yourself. My recommendation is to head to one of two places; the
Steamfont Mountains or Misty Thicket. Steamfont has a combination
of Kobolds and Skeletons and Misty thicket has Goblins and
Skeletons in addition to low level bears. Both will make your
rise through to level 9 and your next rank of spells easily.<br>
<br>
This first rank doesn't have much strategy except that the newbie
hunting areas have wandering mobs for the most part and you
should always pull a single mob if possible and fight within
running distance of a guard. It's important that you make the
determination of whether the fighting is going well at half your
health. If the fight is going sour and you reach half health, run
like hell to the guard. Once your health drops below two bubbles
your speed decreases on a downgrading scale and you won't be able
to escape your agressor.<br>
<br>
LEVELS 9 - 14<br>
<br>
Spells! What a difference these make. This is where how you use
your spells becomes very important and an integral part of your
hunting methodology. The first thing this brings is added
protection as you finally receive the first of your clerical
buffs, Courage. Your clerical buffs are ultra-important in
keeping you up to par with your opponents. Always make sure that
they are up.<br>
<br>
Your tactical spells are Flash of Light, Spook the Dead, and
Yaulp. Now many people underestimate the power of Flash of Light.
This spell is your best friend when fighting live mobs solo. If
the fight gets to be too much, you can cast Flash of Light on the
mob and back away from it quickly while hitting escape to
un-target it. The mob loses sight of you and wanders about
aimlessly for the duration of the spell. This gives you the time
you need to run to safety. Remember, experience saved by not
dying is experience earned.<br>
<br>
Spook the Dead does one better on Flash of Light. Though it only
effects undead it is a cheap fear spell that will be of use to
you your entire career as a Paladin. What this means to you, is
that when you fight undead you can Spook them and then follow
after them chopping into their backs with your sword. This spell
is really only useful outdoors as fearing a mob in a dungeon can
seriously hinder your life-expectancy when all his little buddies
show up.<br>
<br>
Lastly Yaulp. While when you very fist get it the spell uses a
bit of mana, it becomes really cheap really fast and it increases
your strength, AC, and HP. While you may not need it against your
average mob, if it's one you are having difficulty hitting you
can use Yaulp's strength bonus to get that little bit extra
attack rating and strike your blow home.<br>
<br>
The best places to hunt at this range are the North or South
Desert of Ro for mummies, scarabs, and spiders. Cure Poison makes
the spiders not so bad and they hit like whimps. Many people like
to stick in Steamfont near the Minotaur Mines and hunt, but the
return that you will get on mummies will be incredible as though
early on in this range they will be yellow and red you can take
them down with generous use of Spook the Dead.<br>
<br>
One last thing of note is that during this range you will acquire
the Bash skill. This is an all important skill that should, at
least at these levels, prompt you to use a 1HS weapon and shield
if you haven't been. A shield is required to bash and it's most
important benefit is that a bash can stun and interrupt a spell
casting opponent in addition to providing some extra damage that
really adds up.<br>
<br>
LEVELS 15 - 21<br>
<br>
At this level range the important spells are Lull, Holy Armor,
Sense the Dead, and Ward Undead. You may note that I am not
mentioning healing spells as we go. The purpose of those is
self-evident and does not require explanation. How they work into
solo strategy is not critical until the next range of spells.<br>
<br>
Let's start with Lull. Many people downplay the benefit of the
lull line of spells. As a soloist, ignoring them would be
paramount to spitting in the face of a God. Lull is your best
friend when you are alone. Though on occassion a mob resists, for
the most part Lull will allow you to control how you pull mobs as
well as how you progress through dungeons. When cast on a mob,
Lull decreases the mobs aggression rating. This means it is less
likely to attack you as you pass by or man-handle one of its
friends. <br>
<br>
If you haven't already, this is a good time to take up using the
Bow. Get a cheap bow and some cheap arrows to start. You won't be
using it to do damage but rather to pull mobs. Hitting is not
even required to do so in many cases, just taking a pot-shot at
them will piss them off enough. In a camp with two mobs, you can
cast lull on one of them from a distance, and then quickly shoot
the other mob with an arrow to make it charge you and separate
itself from it's buddy. This is a phenomenal way to break a camp
and spread out it's spawns so they are more manageable.<br>
<br>
The second use of Lull, as I mentioned, is to Lull a creature you
need to get by in a close area. If that dang goblin is blocking
your path and you want to get by without making him mad, cast a
lull on him and then run past while he's calm.<br>
<br>
Holy Armor is another buff. This one gives you AC and as always
should be up and running constantly.<br>
<br>
Sense the Dead and Ward Undead. Sense the Dead will allow you to
locate the nearest undead creature. While this would have been
MOST useful in the last rank of spells it's not totally a wast
here. You can use it to locate Crypt mummies if you elect to hunt
in the Southern Desert of ro. Crypt mummies are still good exp at
this rank. You can then of course use your spook and chase
method. One thing to improve it though is Ward Undead. This is a
great, undead only, direct damage spell that does 36-41 points of
damage, which is more than you probably do with your weapon at
these levels.<br>
<br>
Now more than ever it becomes important that you try and
concentrate on hunting locations that have undead as Ward Undead
gives you a HUGE edge. Remember to still try and pull singles and
then you can blast and hack them to smitherenes. A few good
locations for this are the Estate of Unrest and Befallen.<br>
<br>
LEVELS 22 - 29<br>
<br>
This rank's important add-ons are Center, Invis to Undead, and
Root. By far the most important of these is root. Root can be
used both offensively and defensively. As an offensive weapon,
when fighting undead you can start combat by rooting your target.
Then, you can Ward Undead them to oblivion before moving into
melee range to use your sword. You can take on yellow undead at
this level using that stratgey. A few important notes. Obviously
if the mob breaks root, re-root, back up and continuing blasting
before melee. Also, since you can take down yellows early in this
range if they are undead, be SURE that you always start combat
with a full bar of mana. You may have a bit more sit time, but
since you are fighting yellow you can afford a little more down
time with the increased exp gain.<br>
<br>
The other way to use root is defensively. This is accomplished in
two ways of its own. The first is as an escape method. If the mob
is getting the best of you, you can root it and run to safety,
this keeps it from stabbing you in the back as you get away. The
other way is as a poor man's mesmerize. If you get two mobs and
you feel you can handle them one after the other but not at the
same time, you can root one of them and then back up allowing the
second mob to follow you. This keeps the first mob immobilized
and out of the fight while you concentrate on his friend in
single combat. Root is another spell that you will use till the
end of your days.<br>
<br>
Center is an upgrade to your courage spell.<br>
<br>
Invis to Undead will allow you to traverse through undead
controlled areas safely and can be instrumental in getting you to
that single spawn somewhere inside the dungeon.<br>
<br>
As for a place to hunt, in the low to mid levels of this range
there is no other place in Norrath that you should be other than
Unrest. Nothing but undead and plenty of places that if using
your invis to undead you can get single pulls and make LOTS of
exp. Also this is one of the places that Paladins are in demand
rather than shunned. So you shouldn't even have to solo. At the
high end of this level range, you should head to Kunark and do
single pulls with your bow in front or in back of the Sarnak
Fortress in Lake of Ill Omen.<br>
<br>
LEVELS 30 - 38<br>
<br>
At this point I'll despense metioning buffs as you get the idea
and how important they are. As you get better buffs, use them in
leiu of the old ones. Spells of note at this rank are Expulse
Undead, Soothe, and Stun.<br>
<br>
Expulse Undead is an upgrade to your Ward Undead spell and
increases damage to 88-94. This is a HUGE boon to your battle
against the Undead. In combination with your expluse undead
spell, if you haven't acquired one already, you are ready to grab
a couple friends and camp your Ghoulbane in Upper Guk. Ghoulbane
bosts an impressive 142 direct damage proc against undead. With
this and your expulse there aren't many undead that can stand up
to you. Get some gear that gives you dex bonuses to increase the
chance of your Ghoulbane procing.<br>
<br>
Soothe is an upgrade to your Lull spell and should be used in the
same manner as described for Lull.<br>
<br>
Stun is another HUGE improvement for you. As a soloist Stun
should be used strictly to stop your opponents from casting
spells. The time it gives you in mob pause is not worthy of the
sword strokes you miss while casting it. There just isn't a fair
return on the investment. However, when fighting a spellcaster
the investment is huge as it can help keep you from taking an
inodranent amount of damage by interrupting the mobs spell. Stun
combined with your Bash skill can virtually shutout a mobs
casting altogether.<br>
<br>
Hunting at this range is varied as the spell ranges are getting
larger. At low 30s for a soloist, you can continue to hunt
Sarnaks until you ding level 33. Then you can head to Frontier
Mountains and hunt wandering mobs near the zone. Brutes, Goblins,
and Burynai are great exp and can be pulled singley pretty well.
After a level or two there, you can head to Dalnir and fight by
pulling right near the zone and gain another three levels pretty
easily. Remember I'm only listing good solo locations at these
levels. There are obviously lots of good grouping locations. At
level 38 you can head to Thurgadin and hunt in the mines.
Incredibly, this place is fantastic for two levels. You can
easily pull single mobs due to location, they hit extremely
weakly and they pretty much all blue.<br>
<br>
LEVELS 39 - 42<br>
<br>
Now you may be wondering why I stop at 42, well that is my
current level and I don't want to speak beyond my years. Cancel
Magic and Divine purpose are your two great improvements aside
from the usual buffs and healing.<br>
<br>
Divine Purpose is a self only regen spell essentially. If you are
low mana and health, you can cast the spell, sit down and watch
both bars go up almost neck and neck. This will lower your
down-time quite a bit.<br>
<br>
Cancel Magic is important, because as you may have noticed over
the levels, quiet a few mobs use Damage Shields. The time it
takes you to get that DS down is well worth the missed attacks
for the damage it will save you from taking.<br>
<br>
At these levels you can kill cave bears in the Great Divide and
at 40 you can go to the Mines of Nurga and using the techniques
of Soothe to pass and pull, you can move about the dungeon taking
out mobs and raking in the exp.<br>
<br>
A FEW GENERAL NOTES<br>
<br>
When I spoke of root I failed to mention how important it is to
increase your staying power in a battle. If you have mana and you
are getting a bit of a beat down, you can root, back up and casts
heal on yourself to prolong how long you can stay in a fight.<br>
<br>
A note about Lay On Hands (LOH). You should NEVER use LOH while
soloing as a way to stay in the fight longer or kill a much
thougher mob. The bottom line is that as a soloist, LOH is and
will be your only method of staying alive during an escape
attempt when a battle goes bad. Save it for true emergencies when
you are trying to get away. Other-wise it won't be there when you
need it.<br>
<br>
The first rule of soling as a Paladin is Location, Location,
Location. If you are in an area that 3 out of four mobs is blue
and the 4th is green, you are probably in the right place. It's
by this rule based on my experience that I recommended the places
I did in my strategum.<br>
<br>
First and foremost I hope that this guide has helped to dispell
the misconception that Paladins can't solo. We can and do. I also
hope that it will help you all, my borthers and sisters, to keep
playing your characters through those rough and lonely times so
that you can make it to the fun grouping levels or areas.
Everyone knows it's better to have a group and some company, but
at least now you'll have the tools you need to solo if you need
to.</p>
