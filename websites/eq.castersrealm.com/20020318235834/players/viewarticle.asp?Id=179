<br>
Enjoy!!<br>

<br>

Chapter 2 Pop , a blushing elf and the Demi-God<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
It had already been several weeks since, Fry and Rev had been
assign quarters in Felwithe and for those long weeks they waited
for their assignment. So that they cold finally become full
fledged Scouts of Faydwer. But unfortunately the King had no use
for them in all that time..Which really sucked for Fry because
though technically he had no rank in King Tearis army, he was
still under royal control&#133;.more specifically and painfully
Tyia's.<br>
<br>
Fry collased in heap onto the hard bed and tried to sleep, he had
been Tyia's gopher for the last weeks&#133;he didn't mind this
sort of work, he had done it all the time for mom and the
guildmaster. It was the fact that Tyia was the one that was
ordering him around that made it nearly impossible to bear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fry go for this..Fry go for that..Get my slippers, get my
breakfast..clean my room. Fry Fry&#133;. Fry &#133;.Fry&#133;..
Fry. He was so sick of hearing his name now.. Fry Fry Fry Fry Fry
Fry-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;FRY!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh! What!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sheesh Fry I've been calling you for the last coupla
minutes. Get into your uniform, we have some work to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry rolled his eyes and then pulled the covers over his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go away Rev&#133;.Tell Tyia I'm sleeping.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, I'll tell her, but what am I going to tell the
King?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why tell him anything?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because he sent for us silly!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry leapt out of bed, instantly looking refreshed. &quot;LET'S
GO!!!!&quot; And made to charge off to the Throne room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait a sec.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha? &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go take a bath first. You stink&quot; She said holding her
nose and sticking her tongue at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sigh&#133;&quot; Looking somewhat dejected he about faced
and headed to the Soldiers bathing room&#133;not nearly as large
or as even a tenth as nice as the one they robbed weeks ago. 15
minutes later, Fry exited the barracks looking refreshed and in a
new uniform and found Rev just outside leaning against the wall
juggling her Scout's knife on one finger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Much better! I can no longer smell you a mile way&#133;only
half a mile.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Haha&#133;.I don't see how you can be so cheerful after all
that labor Tyia put us through.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What labor?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean What labor? The cleaning and the sweeping,
and the patato chopping&#133;I hate potatoes&#133;..&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno what you mean, I have been relaxing these last few
weeks. Its so nice after all that training.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry looked at her in disbelief.<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean, I've been working for Tyia all this time and you
don't even get one lousy job?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, there was that time she had me come with her on that
trip to Steamfront.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;!!! It's just not fair&#133;&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I told you to stop staring.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I couldn't help ti, it was so big&quot;<br>
<br>
Rev smiled, then desperately tried to stop herself from laughing.
&quot;Haha&#133;Just don't tell her that&#133;You'll never get
off kitchen duty. HAHHAA&quot;<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
In a few short minutes, the two where once again in the presnce
of King Tearis. Only this time it was just them. The queen, the
members of the court, the princess, and the Kings jovial
expression, all gone&#133;this could only mean one thing.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have some matters of upmost importance for the both of
you. I normally would not give such dire matters to ones so un
experienced, but your reports and actions have been more then
excellent.&quot;<br>
<br>
This both uplifted and in away devastated their spirits. Lifted
because of the high praise, but destroyed it because they knew
that what ever the mission was&#133;it had low survivability.<br>
<br>
&quot;Frydious, please stay here for a moment while I brief
Reverdone of her assignment.&quot;<br>
<br>
This troubled him&#133;something was dreadfully wrong&#133;the
King never used his full name.<br>
<br>
Rev stood up and followed the king as they disappeared behind the
Throne room,as he waited for the King to return. His mind raced
to think what could possibly be so wrong&#133;&#133;&#133;dragons?
Some one preparing for war?&#133;..Tyia's bottom getting even
bigger? He snickered at this last thought. At that moment, the
King and rev returned back the Throne room. Rev had dawned a face
of seriousness, she was know only thinking of her mission&#133;.something
was definitely wrong..she was never so serious.<br>
<br>
&quot;Frydious come with me&quot;<br>
<br>
He complied and followed the King behind the Throne room. It was
his first tie back there, the War room. The King paced a bit
around the long table in the center of the room and then stopped
to gaze at the large mural, a map of all of Norrath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Frydious. What I am about to tell you is not to go beyond
this room. You will speak to no one of your task,except to myself
and to my advisors and no one else. If some tells you that they
are carrying orders by me to divulge this, do not believe them.
Is that understood Frydious?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; The King moved to a section of the map that
represented Faydwer and upon finer movement placed his hand above
the area nearby Kelethin. &quot;Over the last few weeks, I have
been getting reports from other Scouts and informants of
increased activity from the Crushbone Orcs. It appears that they
are preparing an assault upon our lands.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry looked surprised&#133;this was not new why was he so
secretive and tight about tha. The Orcs could never beat us.
Though he did not mean to show his dismay, he did and the King
realized it too.<br>
<br>
&quot; I know what you are thinking Frydious. The Orcs are always
preparing for an assault upon Kelethin, but this is different.
This time they are not alone&#133;and are far stronger then ever
before&#133;Unless we find out who is aiding them, why and how&#133;I
fear..that it may be inevitable that they will trample Kelethin&#133;.and
possibly even Felwithe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NO way! Those orcs are nohing compared to us. Don't be
stupi-oops&#133;sorry sir&#133;&quot;<br>
<br>
The King smiled for the first time, but it faded. &quot;it is
alright, I admire those that speak there minds, and I share your
optimizism. That is why we are striking first and why I am
dispatching you to find out more about who ever is aiding the
Orcs. This is your duty to me before you will obtain your rank
Frydious. Well that is all. Go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;By your leave, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Fry bowed and dashed out of the room heading for the stables.<br>
<br>
&quot;And good luck to you, young Fry.&quot;<br>
<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<br>
Of course on his first real mission, it would be cold and
raining. The cloak he wore was not much protection against the
elements. But still the excitement of his first real mission
warmed him, the danger, the thrill of stalking that truly did not
know he was coming it was so great!!! He was so happy he nearly
jumped up and down for joy, but luckily he remembered the part
about the danger and got back into his crouch.<br>
<br>
So far nothing unusual was happening in the Crushbone territory.
The buldings where still decaying, the rain was raining..the orcs
where orcish&#133;nothing truly of note&#133;so he decided to
move from the entrance cave.<br>
<br>
The orcs where slow and dimwitted as usual, he easily made it
past them and promptly got lost. Serves him right for trying to
follow orcish street signs. As he meandered around he found
various things he should return too, seeing about how to free the
slaves, finding out what that awful smell was coming from the
orcish mess hall. But those where side issues, he needed to get
to Crushbone Citadel.<br>
<br>
Luckily, evergreen elixir is also a good tongue loosener as well
as a great party favor, and tool for knocking out castle guards.
So after mugging a Orc legionnaire and interrogating it, for a
long time&#133;it seemed to have pent up feelings and just wanted
some one to talk to.. He finally knew where to find Crushbone
Citadel, and was perched in a tree with a clear view into Emperor
Crush's private quarters. As he waited for several hours in the
unceasing rain, he began to wonder if anything was going to
happen, and if he was going to have to report a negative mission
to the King. He nearly cried about this, but then luck turned out
to be on his side.<br>
<br>
Inside the room a door opened and in lumbered the large leader of
the orcs, Emperor Crush, followed by a male dark elf and then the
prettiest girl he had evr seen&#133;She was so beautiful&#133;.long
silver hair danced freely, she was so perfect, especially the way
the leather she was wearing was so tight and form fitting over
her BLUE skin! This snapped him out of his reverie. She was a
Teir'dal, why was he longing a dark elf&#133;.that was so pretty&#133;.sigh&#133;.<br>
<br>
He began to daydream a bit, but then snapped out of this again as
Crush began to speak to the male.<br>
<br>
&quot;So when cAn We Expecting da new weapons deeeeVinN?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Male seemed obviously agitated by Crush's horrible speech,
but he subdued it or at least tried too. Crush was the king of
Orcs no one could expect him to be able to recite great works.<br>
<br>
&quot;When ever you make your first tribute to Kaiyan'wang M'lord
Crush&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;U take all dAt 'wangy need. Me legIOns need wEApoNs to
CRUSH da smELly elfs&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are most gracious Sire. Kaiyan'wang will only desire a
payment of 200 platinum each month.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dat aLl?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kaiyan'wang only needs a small token of your loyalty.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dis Es gUUD!&quot;<br>
<br>
The dark elf was obviously grating his teeth and desperately
trying to come up with ways to stop this conversation before he
ended up giving Crush a severe beating and a lesson in grammar
and pronunciation.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am glad that you are pleased Emperor Crush, if you will
excuse me. I will go take the platinum now and send it on the way
to Kaiyan'wang's temple. Your new weapons ands the priest who
will teach your oracles higher spell casting *cough* hopefully
some grammar for your uneducated backwater kind *cough* . Pardon
me, sir I have a bit of a cold. As I was saying, they will be
arriving with in the next 3 weeks.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dis Es gud!!! Me Lik cHU dark Elfies!&quot;<br>
<br>
The elf smiled weakly, his resolve fading with each of Crush's
breaths. &quot;Excuse me.&quot; And he quickly exited, leaving
his assistant the female dark elf. To finish up the business.<br>
<br>
When Dvinn closed the door, she slowly began to open her shirt,
peaking both Crush's and Fry's attention. She opened it it some
more and withdrew a small shiney amulet&#133;destroying both
their thoughts or at least Fry's thoughts.<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>
I guess this is my interruption for the chapter. I guess I should
explain this part right quick, you see though it is not widely
known, Orcs and Gnomes are actually related. They both have a
love of shiny things, that click and whir. Gnomes because they
are masters of tinkering with machines and the like&#133;.Orcs&#133;because
they are really&#133;really&#133;really stupid and are easily
fascinated by things like that. So when the girl pulled out the
amulet, you can see why Fry was the only one disappointed.<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;OooH! Shiny Ting!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes , it is shiny. And it is for you Emperor.&quot; The
large orc danced and giggled like a little child.<br>
<br>
&quot;FOor ME!?! YA!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The dark elf girl began to feel her patience beginning to wear.<br>
<br>
&quot;When ever you wish to summon one of us or pray to
Kaiyan'wang simply- &quot; She began to slow down her speech,
like she would a slow child.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rub&#133;.the&#133;emerald&#133;and&#133;&#133; hold..it
&#133;.to &#133;..the&#133;ground&#133; Okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Otay! Rub da grownd and hold da the EmErald!&quot; Crush
repeated happily.<br>
<br>
The girl sighed , her head in her hands and just agreed, she
could feel her mind being dulled by this orc.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to go now. Until another day Emperor Crush.&quot;
She bowed and quickly departed off out of Fry's view. Emperor
Crush admired the amulet for a bit and then placed it on his
windowsill and went out of Fry's view and soon Fry heard the door
close.<br>
<br>
Hmm..this is my chance. Teir'dal are giving the orcs weapons and
training. They are probably rejects from even those of Neriak to
make up some God or something. O well. My mission is done, I
should take that amulet, it may hold some more clues.<br>
<br>
He edged down the branch; just to the end that was sitting right
against the windowsill. He was too short to actually see anything
once he came down from his hiding spot, but he just felt around
in the general area where the amulet was. He kept searching
getting frustrated and then his fingers brushed up against
something. It wasn't metal..metal is hard this was smooth and
soft&#133;he leaned a little bit closer and tried to get a better
fell, it was about hand sized&#133;soft yet firm&#133;.now there
where two of them&#133;<br>
<br>
&quot;GET YOUR HANDS OF ME!!!!&quot; Screamed a female voice
startling him causing him to withdraw his hand and leap back
accidentally knocking the amulet off the sill without meaning
too, but that wasn't his primary concern. It was the female dark
elf looking purple her faced flushed with a mixture of anger and
embarrassment. She fumed at him and then leapt out onto the
branch.<br>
<br>
&quot;No wait don't get out here!&quot; Fry cried<br>
<br>
&quot;Save it for the thrashing I am going to give - AAH!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AAH!!!&quot; The both screamed as the branch gave away with
the extra weight and the y plummeted to the ground, she crashed
into thee mud hard losing her breath and then lost it again when
Fry landed on top of her. And so they both stayed, the air
knocked out of both of them for those few short moments. Fry
slowly came out of his daze, to find himself staring into the
elf's eyes. At first the seemed, weak and without fury as before,
but that changed quickly when she realized he was on top of her.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;GET OFF ME!!!!&quot; She shouted and without waiting for
him to move, threw him off.<br>
<br>
A sharp pain jabbed him in his back, and as he investigated he
fond that she had accidentally thrown him on top of the amulet.
Trying to move fast as possible, he pocketed the amulet and tried
to regain his bearings, but to know luck the girl was also on her
feet. She was needless to say, mad. So mad, fry could have sworn
that the rain that fell on her was actually boiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have endured ridicule, the touch of sweaty trolls, the
rank breath of ogres and orcs, but never in my life, have ever
been so humiliated in my life!!!! I am going to make you
suffer!!!!!&quot; With that she withdrew two daggers, with such
precision and deftness, that it signified one thing, she was a
skilled scout like Fry. Though he did not realize it just at that
moment, his heart opened even more for this girl. A beautiful
girl who was also a skilled scout&#133;she was perfect&#133;aside
from the fact at that moment she wanted to kill him. At this
moment, though he knew she was a deadly enemy, she was also a
girl&#133;and some one he had wronged..at that moment his sense
of honor rose.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
That startled her, her she was just inches away from attacking
and killing him and he was apologizing for grabbing her&#133;and
not only that he was sincere&#133;It was so new to her, it
stunned her, no one had ever really treated her with respect. So
she didn't know what to do, and neither did Fry. Fry never wished
to kill any one, or hurt a female&#133;..aside from Tyia maybe&#133;and
he did not want to fight this girl even if she was a Dark Elf.
And she was unsure if she should attack him, some one so innocent
to apologize to their greatest enemy. <br>
<br>
So they just stood there for those few moments, unmoving until..<br>
<br>
&quot;WhAT R going there!?&quot; cried Emporer Crush<br>
&quot;What's happening out there Sevet?&quot; called Dvinn doing
his best to ignore Crush<br>
<br>
Though she was still unsure what to make of Fry, reflexes took
advantage.<br>
<br>
&quot;INTRUDER!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry instantly dashed away and ran as fast as he could towards the
exit cave, leaping from shadow to shadow as hundreds of orcs
descended upon Sevet's position. She knew that he would escape,
she was the only one that could have stopped him and she let him
go. Why?<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Felwithe was abuzz with celebration; the gilding of Scouts was a
new affair. It was usually done quietly in Kelethin, but King
Tearis wanted special attention to the newest members of the
Ranks of Scouts.<br>
<br>
In the main hall of Felwithe, bards blared triumphant music that
nearly deafened the gathered crowd, but soon the bards where out
done by the cheering crowd&#133;more specifically Fry and Rev's
Mothers as the 2 new scouts entered the hall. They stood at the
entrance and awaited to be announced, which was a first for both
of them.<br>
<br>
The page shouted<br>
<br>
&quot;Introducing to M'Lord. Scout of Faydwer Rank of Chroito
First Class. Reverdone Moocienaga Dal Kampo Ciba !&quot;<br>
<br>
She stepped forward and approached the Throne, her green cloak
with gold trim, with the Scout insignia displayed proudly on the
shoulders beautifully matched her long flowing hair and
complexion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Introducing to M'Lord Scout of Faydwer Rank of Chroito
First Class. Frydious Angus-Bilbao Menlore!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YEAH FRY!!! THAT&quot;S MY BOY!!!!!!! DON'T SHUSH ME!!
&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry flushed slightly but continued up to the Throne and knelt
beside Rev and awaited the King to approach them from the Throne.
The queen was beaming proudly at the newest additions and even
Tyia was smiling&#133;..mainly because of all the things she was
thinking of torturing Fry with know that he was enlisted in the
ranks.<br>
<br>
The King stood over them smiling a smile 10 miles wide. He placed
his hands on their shoulders. <br>
<br>
&quot;Rise Scouts, for this is the last time you will ever kneel
before me.&quot;<br>
<br>
They did so, to the cheers of the crowd, again the mothers
drowned out the rest of the crowd.<br>
&quot;Fry, Rev, though you are young you have proven that you are
skilled beyond your years, and it is with great pleasure that I
welcome you to our ranks. From now until, you return to the great
mother, you are Scouts of -&quot;<br>
<br>
The sound of someone clapping interrupted the king. The King
looked up to the source of the interruption high up at the top of
the room<br>
<br>
&quot;Augustas!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fry instantly turned around to look where the King was.
&quot;POP!&quot; It couldn't be, after all this time. It was
Fry's father hovering the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you decided finally became a Scout. I am proud, but
unfortunately, you have chosen the wrong side of Kaiyan'wang's
temper!&quot; He floated down to the floor and stared past Fry
and at King Tearis.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pop?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Augustas, so you return after all this time! Where have you
been, where did you go when Faydwer needed you the most!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Having a revelation about Norrath, but I am not here to
talk about that Tearis. I am here to deliver a message.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what is that, you deserter!&quot;<br>
<br>
Augustas raised his hand and fire and lightning encircled it.
&quot;Do not cross Kaiyan'wang again!&quot; Without another word
a bolt leapt out of his hands and toward the throne, not to the
King, or Fry or Rev, or even the Queen&#133;but Tyia. Tyia was
too scared to move as the bolt grew closer and closer and then
there was a flash and explosion and a cry of her name. When she
opened her eyes, Fry was in front of her, he had taken the spell
meant for her. He staggered slightly, his prized new cloak was
incinerated and he had many burns, and his strength gave way and
Fry collapsed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Father&#133;&#133;.why?&quot;<br>
<br>
He blacked out..<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
Well I guess I should interrupt one last time, not for a bit of
information, but because my feather pen is running out of ink. So
I will just have to continue this once I go buy some more. I just
hope the merchant doesn't over charge me again. well that is side
tracking. Until later dear precious readers&#133;.even if you are
human.<br>
