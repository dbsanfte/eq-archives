<tr> 
<td width='80%'><P>The distant sound of troll war drums awakened him from his troubled dreams.
Though he was drenched in sweat from the fetid air of the Innothule swamp,
Patryn was shivering uncontrollably. Patryn turned to check on his still
sleeping companions before heading towards a nearby hilltop. He had much to
ponder this day, and did not wish to disturb his companions. As he buckled on
his armor, the paladin began to recall the vision he had received from Mithanial
Marr.</P>
<P>Patryn saw a knight in sun drenched armor holding a sword glimmering with an
inner fire. This figure in golden armor from his vision could only be an avatar
of Marr himself. As Patryn stared in awe, the knight raised his sword in salute.
A voice, boomed in Patryn's head, &quot;A dark stain has spread itself in the
heart of Old Guk. My chosen champion has fallen, and another must carry the
great burden of restoring Guk to its former glory. Go now with my blessing and
retrieve that which I have left for you.&quot;</P>
<P>Patryn knew then that this day would be a true test of knighthood. Quickly he
made his way back to camp, with a new sense of purpose in his heart. He awakened
his companions who had travelled this far with him, Garik, the quick and cunning
ranger, Kianna a druid of the all mother Tunare, and finally the fell
spellbinders Saurus and Mineme. Without a word, they all follwed him into the
city of Guk. They could see the hardened resolve on his face and the lightness
of his step, and knew that he had been divinely inspired. An unspoken message of
cameraderie passed between all the group members and without a look back, they
stepped into the heart of darkness.</P>
<P>The froglok guards at the entrance glowered at Patryn dubiously.</P>
<P>&quot;You may not pass. This is the home of the frogloks.&quot; a guard
croaked.</P>
<P>&quot;I come to claim that which is mine to aid the frogloks in their war
against the vile undead which infest this city.&quot; Patryn replied calmly.</P>
<P>&quot;We have no need of help. Our Shin Lord fights against the dark ones
even now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your pride will be your own undoing. We come to aid your cause. Do not
scoff at such an offer lightly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well you may pass for now. Something is amiss in this city. Please
speak to the Shin Lord.&quot; the guard croaked again then returned to his
patrols.</P>
<P>Patryn bowed before the guard and then headed further into the city. The
frogloks all stared dubiously at him but let him pass without harassment. He
sensed that something was terribly wrong as he passed froglok knights standing
rigidly at their posts. A great sense of sadness seemed to pervade the very
heart of Guk.</P>
<P>Upon reaching the palace Patryn heard an invocation to Innoruuk and the
casting of a spell of of the dark arts. Quickly, he and his stouthearted
companions ran into the palace to give what aid they could. As he entered, all
the guards continued to stare ahead not even noticing him. He approached the
throne room, and found the Shin Lord, a fellow paladin of Marr, seated upon his
throne. Kneeling, Patryn bowed his head to his brother in arms.</P>
<P>&quot;I come to aid you in your quest to rid the lands of all the undead
which have infested it.&quot; Patryn said after rising to his feet.</P>
<P>&quot;There...is...no...need....of...help.&quot; The Shin Lord whispered. His
glazed eyes seemed to stare straight ahead without any recognition. Though the
Shin Lord was resplendant in his silvery plate, the armor seemed tarnished and
out of use. His shoulders were stooped as if a great weariness had overcome him.
His sword, the ancient Ghoulbane granted to him by Marr lay at his feet
untouched and collecting dust.</P>
<P>&quot;Gooooo...now...this...audience...is...over...&quot; again the Shin Lord
whispered barely audibly.</P>
<P>&quot;I have been sent by Mithanial Marr himself to come to your aid. I do
not know the full meaning of my vision, but the intent was clear. I must come
here to rid the land of the undead frogloks. How can you sit idly by while your
people suffer so?&quot; Patryn exclaimed.</P>
<P>Suddenly the room seemed to darken and the Shin Lord grew in stature. His
eyes glowed a malevolent yellow and his green froglok skin began to sag and
drip. Patryn stared in horror as the Shin Lord raised Ghoulbane. As he did so
Ghoulbane lit with an inner fire and the pommel seemed to burst into flame. The
Shin Lord let out a startled yelp and dropped the weapon.</P>
<P>&quot;You have ruined your own lands. I will not let you ruin mine.&quot; The
Shin Lord yelled as he rushed towards Patryn, claws seeming to grow out of his
hands. Patryn finally realized then that the Shin Lord had indeed fallen from
grace and was longer his brother in arms. From the niches in the walls froglok
knights and shaman rushed to the aid of their Lord. A necromancer began casting
a spell of ruin and Patryn felt the lifeforce draining from him. In despair
Patryn lifted his blackened iron bastard sword with one hand while fingering his
holy symbol with his other. He felt warmth flowing through him and felt
strangely rejuvenated. Silently thanking Mithanial Marr, Patryn turned towards
the Froglok lord. He was feeling magnficent of spirit now and could feel a coat
of transparent armor coating him. Suddenly mystic symbols flashed before his
eyes and he knew then that he had the full backing of Marr in this endeaver as
he felt more vitality than he had in years.</P>
<P>&quot;To battle my fellow warriors. Together we must destroy this
infestation.&quot; Patryn yelled.</P>
<P>As he said this his companions began killing the froglok knights and shaman.
The spellcasters unleashed their mighty spells and a huge inferno blazed within
the room separating Patryn from his companions. He was alone facing the Shin
Lord, who seemed to be quite formidable. With one last prayer Patryn raised his
sword, and prepared to defend himself.</P>
<P>The Shin Lord rushed forward and with his bare hands and seemed to move
faster than thought breaking through Patryn's defenses and slashing him with the
webbed claws. Patryn turned quickly and parried the next blow, and the one after
dodging a kick from the froglok in the process. The Shin Lord kept attacking,
seeming to derive his strength from the madness which drove him. As he continued
attacking recklessly Patryn saw his chance and swung with both arms driving his
sword into the froglok. Miraculously the Shin Lord began to claw at Patryn’s
face with the sword impaled in his breast. As he did so he drove the sword
deeper and deeper, yet he seemed to not even feel it. Patryn quickly backed up
in horror, and withdrew his sword. As he did so the froglok’s wound seemed to
close over itself. He realized then that the necromancer was healing the froglok
lord. Seeing the necromancer in the corner in the midst of casting his dark
magics, Patryn called upon the might of Mithanial Marr and struck down the
necromancer expulsing him to the glory of the gods. For good measure he drove
his sword deep into the necromancer and watched as it squirmed until finally it
had breathed its last.</P>
<P>Turning back to the Shin Lord, Patryn moved too late to deflect a blow aimed
for his exposed back, the claws of the Shin Lord ripped through the plate mail
and tore a deep gash into Patryn’s back. Feeling woozy, from the lack of blood
and the spells of the necromancer, Patryn knew he could expect no help from his
companions who were still desperately fighting their own battle. Resolutely he
turned back to the Shin Lord only to be driven back by a kick to the groin
followed by a claw to his arm tearing into sinew and flesh. Patryn gritted his
teeth in agony, as he saw that his left arm would be useless for some time as
pus and blood oozed from the claw marks. He valiently raised his sword to defend
himself but knew that the end was near. He was weakening from a loss of blood
and the Shin Lord seemed to gain new strength from seeing his enemy’s blood
flowing freely. The Shin Lord attacked again and Patryn knew that he faced
death. He silently prayed to Marr for the safety of his companions, before the
final blow came. The impact knocked him off his feet and as he lay upon the
ground, he saw the Golden Knight standing before him. His spirit soared as he
knew he was going into the embrace of Marr.</P>
<P>In the next moment Patryn felt a healing touch. His wounds began to close and
strength returned to his arms. He felt revitalized and faced the froglok lord
once more. As he did so he seemed to glow a bright golden color. His armor was
no longer the silver plate which had been handcrafted for him by Inknar
Fireforge, instead it was the color of bright flame. His sword was no longer the
deep black, but instead felt lighter in his hand, and when he looked at it in
awe it seemed to burst into flame. As the Shin Lord rushed forward, he raised
his sword in both hands and with a prayer to Marr swung his blade cleaving the
Shin Lord in two. The Froglok’s legs kept walking two more steps forward
before collapsing next to its torso and head.</P>
<P>Patryn knelt down and closed the eyelids of the Shin Lord and stood up to
rush to the aid of his companions. He found them standing around him reverently,
bruised but quite alive, the bodies of the frogloks fallen around them. Moving
to the throne, Patryn retrieved the Ghoulbane, and as he lifted it he felt the
rightness of his holding the blade. He knew then what he had come to do and why
Marr had sent him the vision. With one last look at the froglok Shin Lord he and
his companions left the palace, the blight had been cleaned from the heart of
Guk.</P>
