  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p>First off I have never lost a duel.  I have killed 26 people in duels but never lost.  I only 'could' have lost once and that was against an enchanter when I didn't have pet out or resist magic up.<br>
<br>
Against warriors:<br>
Hope they don't have very high magic resist, but if they do, they typically dont have very high resists of any other type and always do a prefight debuffing by grouping and dispel magic them like 10 times or at least enough to strip 15 buffs off.  Once this is done you have to realize that they will probably have about 60-80 magic resist (around lvl 50ish anyway).  Basically your root wont last long against a warrior so make sure you have a pet out and send pet against the warrior right at the beginning of the fight.  Run the warrior around all day until he starts to fight your pet out of frustration.  Then get back into range and poison dot them.  If that doesn't take the warrior off your pet keep tossing cold blasts against them until ither your pet is low on health or the warrior starts going after you again.  If pet gets low you need to heal it, theres really no good way to kill a warrior in a duel unless you have a pet.<br>
<br>
All other melee types just basically use pet but you can probably root park and dot them and let pet stick close to you.  You should do a prefight debuff on them as well or they may have a lot of resist buffs on that can seriously skew your strategy.  Monks are actually the easiest melee class to duel because of the ease in which you can root, malise and dot them to death.  pets don't really matter on low magic resist tanks, just root park them and dot some.<br>
<br>
Casters: You MUST have all resist spells up that are appropriate for the type of caster you are fighting.  Only challenge here will be a wizard with lure spells, but since you will have resist magic up it shouldn't be too much trouble unless he actually gets a snare off on you.  Basically stick really close to the wizard if they are trying to snare so they will snare themself along with you, making it very easy to run up and interrupt their casting.  Basically what you want to do against casters is make sure you have very good resists (doesn't have to be like 100+ but wouldn't hurt).  Also on casters you need to make it short and sweet by poison dots and cold blasts (or poison blasts if you have some nice velious spells).  Don't bother trying to debuff casters as they can probably dish out way more damage on you before you can get off debuffs.  Keep pet on the caster (buff your pets magic resist so the casters cannot root or snare very easy).  Your pet will probably interrupt their casting or distract the caster's pet enough for you to poison dot and dd your way to victory.<Br>
<br>
Example of a good fight I had recently was in the city of mist arena (yes they have an arena in that zone).  I went against a 53 mage and a 51 wizard at once. I being lvl 55 at the time.  First off I made sure it was fair and let them have all the time they wanted to prepare.  I basically buffed myself to the max and all resists and switched a few resist gears instead of my normal gear.<br>
<br>
Mage sent pet at beginning of the fight but my pet quickly distracted the mage enough for me to nuke the mage down very fast.  (mage with no hps = corpse with no more pet).  I took a partial ice comet from the wizard in this time but I was still about half hps and I kept running up and whacking the wiz between casting poison dot and blasting so that I didn't take too much more damage.  Wizard only took 3 spells to kill because I didn't even have to root him, just run up and smack him around enough to interrupt a spell or two.  I kept alacrity on myself just for this purpose considering I didn't expect my pet to last too long against 2 casters.<br>
<br>
After the fight I had 1 bub of mana and half hitpoints and even offered for a rogue to come in and have some fun (I had a see invis bracer).  Rogue, pulling her comrades corpses out of the arena kindly declined and <em>/smiled</em>.<br>
<br>
So basically against tanks, you need to let your pet distract them enough for them to try to switch targets long enough for you to get some good spells off on them (not magic based of course but mostly cold, poison, and disease based).<br>
<br>
Against casters you want to alacrity yourself, full resist, and resist pet along with the usual pet buffs (more if you have time).  If against a pet class, have your pet distract their pet while you nuke away on the caster so their pet dies before it kills your pet.  Against a non-pet caster, interrupting is prime.  Very short casting spells usually are easily resisted (blind spells and stuns espescially).  The only problem you will have is when fighting an enchanter who opens the fight with a tash spell (you need to have very high resist magic gear for this not to mess you up bad approx 100 resist magic after self buff would be good).  Basically you have to mimic the enchanters moves to counter their specialties.  if enchanter uses pet, basically send your pet against theirs and nuke their pet so your pet can interrupt the enchanter's casting.  (enchanter would seriously whoop yer butt if you let their pet live)  The good news is enchanters don't usually resist magic buff their pet because they rely on group resist magic a lot, so you can often root their pet and nuke away on an enchanter while your pet stuns their casting.  Typically the enchanter will try to stun your pet to get some spells off but if you were smart and magic resisted your pet the enchanter wont think to tash your pet to go to work on you.<br>
<Br>
Shaman rule in outdoor fights, but suck very bad indoors.  Keep that in mind when someone wants to pick a fight.  If you have very limited room it skews your chances significantly and if your opponent has high resist magic you might as well /decline an indoor fight.  You can win very easily against anyone with low magic resist indoors but I would advise a pre-fight debuffing to make sure they didn't get help.<br>
<br>
The only other trouble you will have is against druids, but basically make sure your pet keeps interrupting them and they won't last long enough to get a snare off on you.  Not that druid snare does any good considering they don't hardly ever melee during a duel, but they could use the range casting to their advantage if you don't.<Br>
<br>
Good items for a shaman to have in a pvp encounter are: Jaundiced bone bracer, howling harpoon, pegasus feather cloak, frog crown, totemic breastplate, bloodforge hammer, bloodstained mantle, planes gear, diamond mask and rings (plat or velium), Greater null potions (resist magic), Forget name of the 300hp potions but you combine ice giant toes and sage leaf (from gypsies) and they instant cast to heal yourself if you go low on hps too fast in a fight (very nice against a wizard), and greater resist cold and fire potions.<Br>
<br>
You don't have to have any of those items, they are just the ones that give you a big advantage.<Br>
<br>
I am not very cocky in a duel, I realize that some people know how to player kill a lot better than I do, but if you go into a fight prepared theres really no match for a shaman; mostly because of self and pet resist buffs.<br>

I've had to use mind warfare against 2 really good people.  One was a lvl 38 warrior (I was 39 at the time).  he had a druid buff him and had very high resist magic gear and I only got one spell off on him out of like 25 casts.  (stressing how important it is to debuff a warrior prefight if you are going to duel indoors).  Other mind warfare I did was against a lvl 51 monk when I was lvl 37.  (he told me he was lvl 41 not 51 heh)  He resisted enough spells for me to go oom in the time it took him to get a mend up again so I just kept pet kiting him till he got sick of it and left.<br>
<br>
My worse nightmare would be a monk with high resist gear (planar and diamond stuff).  he could kill pet in a few rounds and resist most of your spells probably and kill you very fast.  Only way to win against a monk with high resist gear is to pet kite him and hope he doesn't turn on your pet too much.  If he does you better hope you got tons of healing mana and buffs on pet.<br>
<Br>
So in my 57 levels as a undefeated shaman I can safely say that this is a good strategy provided you make sure people don't cheat by getting buffs from other people or are way out of your level range.  Sorry if I repeated some stuff, I just wanted to recap some things before adding information so people wouldn't get too lost while reading this.
Just remember that most of the advantage of being a shaman in a duel is in 3 things:<br>
1) ability to land spells or keep pet alive and doing damage long enough to kill the opponent.<br>
2) resists (even against tanks resists are important) You never know when a tank will go dirty and use some pumice or death beetle gland, etc.<br>
3) pet.  Your pet gives you probably the largest advantage in a fight.<br>  If you fight without a pet you might as well just zone unless the other person completely sucks at dueling.<br>
