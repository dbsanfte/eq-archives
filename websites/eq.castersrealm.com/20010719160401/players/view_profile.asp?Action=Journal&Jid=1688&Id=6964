  <tr><td class='db'> </td></tr>
  <tr><td class='db'><p>The kobold howled in pain as jagged spikes of
steel ripped apart its flesh.  Aurra smiled at Kinzix
between axe swings, enjoying every moment she spent
with him, relishing each kill they made.  He returned
her smile with a wicked grin, casting another spell,
and the kobold fell to the ground, smoldering.  The
hunting party rested. The bard sang various songs
while the shaman chanted over some herbs. She sat by
Kinzix and rested, and began to speak, but noticed his eyes were closed.  He was regaining his energy and she shouldn't disturb him.</p>

<p>     "I'm going to scout," she announced, standing.
The group members nodded, and so she left.  She began
to wonder as she stepped carefully through the
tunnels, when the other Kobolds would notice their
comrades were missing.  Hadn't they heard their cries
of pain?  Maybe they didn't care... or maybe they knew better than to go look for them.</p>

<p>     The tunnels were quiet and empty.  No fresh
tracks were pathed across the dirt floor.  She could
hear running in the tunnel before her.  Not the sound
of paws but of feet, and something indiscernible.  The running was slowing, and now she could hear pained grunts.  A man ran by her, not one from her group. Seeing her, he stopped and collapsed at her feet.</p>

<p>      "You fool! Be gone!" she whispered harshly at
him, stepping back.</p>

<p>      "Help," he begged in a trembling voice,
clinging to her legs, trying to stand himself up.
Sweat matted his hair to his brow, his veins were
enlarged, pumping blood labouredly.  Small gashes
covered his body, almost like bites... large bug
bites...  Anger gripped her features and she kicked
the man to the ground, readying her axe to end him of
his misery and put her out of danger, but he convulsed violently and then his veins ruptured in his temples, steaming blood poured from his ears.  She put her axe down and listened to the noise above the hissing from his boiling veins.  He was dead, but she was not out of danger.</p>

<p>   A spider leapt onto the body.  She jumped back
and froze.  It's black legs rubbed together over it's
small chitined head, as if satisfied with it's kill.
She gulped hard as it turned toward her.  Two other
spiders scrambled up behind it and latched onto the
corpse, feeding off the warmed blood that spilled from it.  The large one hissed at Aurra, and the two
smaller ones turned to face the shadow knight.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>   A surprised shriek pulled Kinzix from his
meditation.  He looked around him... Aurra was gone.
He stood and shouted for her, summoning his pet to
follow him.  A shimmering white cloud swirled and
formed at his side.</p>

<p>   "Don't come here!" she yelled back, pain
dripping from her words.  She was being attacked, he
had to help her.  He rushed forward, uncertain of the
exact direction her cry came from as it echoed through all of the tunnels, but the half elf caught him and yanked him back into the small enclave.</p>

<p>   "You heard her!" he scolded Kinzix.  The sound
of her armored body hitting the ground echoed in the
tunnels as well, and each member exchanged a doubtful
glace with one another.  He audibly growled at the
bard and fought back the urge to strike him down.  He
had not had the chance to tell her what he had been
meaning to, and to have her die... He calmed,
somewhat, at that thought.  She could take care of
herself, he reminded himself.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>   The spider crawled off of her as she fell to
the ground, feigning her own death, but her blood was
boiling through her veins.  The spider's venom was
harsh.  Sated, the three spiders left the shriveled
corpse as well as Aurra, and retreated back down the
dark tunnel.  She pushed herself up onto her hands and knees and began to crawl away from the corpse.  They would come back for her... she couldn't go back to her hunting party, they would follow her there, and then all would be lost.</p>

<p>   "I am leaving," she groaned, hoping someone
from her party heard her.  Time and pain led her to
somewhere near where the party had infiltrated
Nagafen's Lair.  Her blood had cooled, then turned
cold as she heard the scraping and clicking sounds of
many, many pairs of arachnid legs in the distance,
closing in on her.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>   He sat and glared out into the tunnel.  His
pet marched back and forth in front of him, sensing
his anxiety.  She had been gone for too long.  He
stood and dismissed his pet.  The wispy cloud groaned
and puffed out, it's vapors returning to the air with
a whispered release of life.</p>

<p>   "What are you doing?" asked the bard, though
he knew the answer.  He didn't want to have to retrain the dark elf, but that was quickly becoming his only option.  Kinzix didn't answer him.  He did not believe in the gods, but he begged something to lead him to her as he began to cast his spell.  The air around him bubbled and wrapped around him, and then he was gone.</p>

<p>   The shaman stood. "I will look for her as well, are you coming?" the quiet barbarian offered.  The bard had no choice, he could not, he would not, stay in the lair alone. The pair set off into the narrow tunnels together.</p>

<p>       Kinzix felt himself landing on the ground,
having reached his destination.  Opening his eyes, he
stood amazed.  Aurra sat on the ground in front of
him, resting against a rock.  She'd suffered two deep
gashes into her arm.  Steam rose from the wounds as
the blood poured from it.  Lava duct crawlers, he
thought with a grimace and kneeled forward to bandage
her.</p>

<p>       She jumped in surprise, swinging her weapon
around to fend off whatever was touching her.  She
stopped herself short of slicing off Kinzix's hand and smiled, dropping her axe to the ground.</p>

<p>       "You think you're out of danger?" he asked
playfully.  The effect of the poison showed in her
weak laugh.  She slumped back against the rock.  The
bandaging was complete.</p>

<p>       "All better," she groaned and laughed another
pain filled laugh.  She looked at her arm.  Hot blood
began to seep through the dressing.  "Son of a...
that's going to leave a mark."</p>

<p>       Kinzix frowned.  They needed the shaman.  The
bandaging wouldn't be enough to make up for the blood
she had lost, and the poison was known to be fatal.
Words formed on his lips, and he stopped himself.  He
was about to ask her to be partner to his curse.  As
long as he or his mother lived, anything that he held
dear would be destroyed by her.  I will protect her,
he thought, I want her to know she means that much to
me.  If only he knew the right words.  She was slowly
growing paler before him.  Talk! he yelled at himself.</p>

<p>       "Aurra..." he began, she looked up at him.
"Would you ever get married?"  The question puzzled
her, but she responded, a sweet smile on her lips.
The way she looked at him put him at ease.</p>

<p>       "Well, that depends on who asks," was her
reply.  No "yes," no "no"...  his heart began to beat
harder.</p>

<p>       "I'm asking," he said boldly, but it continued
in his head "for a straight answer, please!"  He held
her hand in both of his, still kneeling by her side.</p>

<p>       "Aurra, will you marry me?"  The words had
caught her off guard, and she wondered for a moment if the lack of blood was causing her to hallucinate. She had never understood marriage until she met him.
Together, they accomplished so much, and his smile,
his touch, his presence put her at rest.  Always she
had felt pain, rage, but something as soft as the
rustle of his robe put her at peace.  Pictures of
Grammaw hunched over the two rough doll-like forms of
Jaileint and Cherrish flashed through her head, past
conversations about the wrath of Kinzix's mother on
all he touched rang in her ears, but she didn't care.
She didn't fear death, and nothing else mattered to
her.  She wouldn't deny what was in her nature.</p>

<p>      "Of course I will," she replied. "I love you."</p>
<p>      The shaman and bard had found their way to the
couple.  Quickly, the shaman began summoning the
healing powers of the earth around him, and her wounds began to disappear, new life surged within her. Relief and joy overtaking Kinzix, he gathered her face in his hands and kissed her like only a lover could.</p>

<p>      He looked around him as the kiss ended, as if
expecting the vengeful woman who gave him birth to
shatter the moment into a million pieces.  No one's
there, he thought to himself, but for how long?</p></td></tr>
