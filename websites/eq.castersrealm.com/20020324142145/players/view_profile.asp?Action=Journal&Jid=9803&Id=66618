  <tr><td class='db'>Choosing my Path:


I was born the daughter of a Kelethin lift guard and a successful druid maiden.   My mother taught me at an early age of the ways of the druid (she had yet to show me the power of her spells, but that’s a little later).  I though hmm that could be exciting but there has to be more out there for me.  One day while still undesided about the path I would choose I met a highelf named Thalandra, I had heard stories around the tree houses of Kelethin that highelfs were extremely snobbish and acted as if woodelfs were not good enough to breath the same air as they did. But Thalandra was different; she introduced herself to me with a bright smile and warm hello.  I in turn, being the angel I was at the time, gave here my brightest smile and introduced myself as Wildkitten.  She had told me that she was only in her second scroll (whatever that meant), and I suppose she could read the confusion in my face when she had told me it meant that she had only lived as a wizard for two seasons as I would call it.  I was fascinated by her I remember thinking wow a wizard I wanna do that.  Of course being born a woodelf this was impossible, so I just watched Thalandra in quiet fascination as she worked her magic on bats and wasps.  It was then that I decided I must choose my path, would I be like my mother and follow her on the path of the druid, would I become a Bard and sing beautiful music for all of Norrath to hear, or would I become a paladin and remain the sweet angelic creature I was.  My decision didn’t come until about a week later when my mother and I had gotten into an argument over something silly, I remember her telling me “if your friends jumped out of the tree house would you do it too?” of course my reply to her wasn’t very angelic so of course paladin was out as soon as I told her “only if you jump first.”  Needless to say as soon as I said it I took off like a dark elf from a treant (well a darkelf at my age anyway).  Unfortunately, like I had said before my mother is a druid.  This is when I realized that I wanted to become a druid.  Every try to outrun a druid? Not very easy when you don’t have sow.  But see my mother didn’t even flinch when I took off, I thought hahah she can’t catch me I’m way younger then she is.  This is when I learned of the power of root.  With a slight twitch of her fingers my mother had stopped me dead in my tracks.  I learned then the only way to truly understand the ways of the druid, was to become one myself… My path had been chosen I was to be a druid..........


A new horizon:


I loved my mother greatly for showing me and teaching me the basics of being a druid, when I asked her other questions she would tell me that she would tell me when I was older… DAMN I hated that! I had started to wonder where all the druids had gone the oldest one I had met was my mother and after her they didn’t go much past their 8th season.  I had lost touch with Thalandra shortly into my first season, and still think of her every time I see a wizzy twitch their fingers, after all at the time she had been the only wizzy I had met.   One day, midway into my second season, while out killing those evil wasp drones out in front of the tree house another druid, a very beautiful woodelf well into her 20’s in season, approached me.  Beside her was a Highelf, well since Thalandra was the first highelf to ever give me the time of day; I was in a way afraid of him.  I knew he was much older then Thalandra and from what I knew of the power of magic it grows stronger with seasons as well, so he was indeed much more powerful as well.  I didn’t know what to make of this pair.  The woodelf introduced herself as Wildkat, and said oh and this is Mord (pointing to the highelf behind her).  His name was Mordeo actually and it nearly floored me that he to was kind, so unlike many of the highelfs I had met before him.  I had decided that Thalandra and Mordeo were definitely unique.  Wildkat on the other hand, I had greatly admired her, she wasn’t like anyone I had met before there was something I could see in her that I really can’t describe, and I just remember being in awe of this woodelf.  Mordeo and Wildkat had told me of a distant city on the continent of Antonica.  The city was called Qeynos and they had offered to take me there if I chose to explore.  Without hesitation I had agreed to go.  I had never met these two before in my life and here I was agreeing to let them take me to another continent far away from my mother and my father.  There was something about them that made me trust them, a sense of honor that I had never seen before.  Wildkat had explained to me that when we go we would have to take a long, and for me dangerous run, through North Karana and West Karana and that I would have to listen to her and Mordeo and do as they say on the way. I agreed to do so and with one twitch of his fingers Mordeo had taken us all to a tall structure in the middle of North Karana.  I remember Wildkat casting a spell on me called Scale of the Wolf, and then Mordeo Cast invisibility on me. My only instructions were to tell them when I felt as if I was starting to appear, and to stay in between them as we ran.  I was to follow Wildkat and Mordeo would follow behind us both..........


Qeynos:


What a city this was, a large stone gate and guards that looked at me indifferently.  Indifferently? Yes truly this was going to be a new and wonderful experience for me. Wildkat had told me that once I was of a good season I would be able to go to nearby BlackBurrow and kill gnolls, and when I could do that the guards and merchants here would grow to love me.  Wildkat and Mordeo wished me luck and with that they were gone.  I would not see them again until many seasons later.  I found myself standing alone in a strange city. Many new and exciting people bustling in and out of the gates, I saw Barbarians, Erudites, Gnomes, Darkelves, Halflings, Halfelves, Woodelves, Humans, Highelves, even Ogres and Trolls (though the guards didn’t like them much). Qeynos was indeed a diverse and exciting city.  I had written to my mother on many occasions telling her of the new and wonderful people I was meeting and of the many new advcntures I was finding.  She would write back how proud she had been of me and that she was glad that I was growing into the druid she knew I could always be, all the while telling me how much she missed me and wished I could come visit.......... 
 

BlackBurrow:


I had finally reached a season that I could head out to nearby BlackBurrow to slaughter gnolls, It was here that I met a human wizard named Emteit.  Emteit would become my hunting partner and friend for many more seasons.  Emteit helped me learn the ways of battle inside of BlackBurrow and we talked of many things. Slaughtering gnolls had become my favorite pastime, and I had finally earned the respect of the guards and merchants in Qeynos. I had become stronger and more confident in myself within the walls of BlackBurrow.  I had made up my mind that I too could become strong and confident like that wonderful druid that I had met that faithful day in Kelethin..........  


My Best Friend and a new family:


While making a bank run one day (well into my 10th season) I met a highelf on the way through the Qeynos gates.  He introduced himself as Tathus and told me that he was a Magician.  Well knowing my feelings towards Highelves, I admit it I was frightened of him, and I also knew that he sensed it, however I vowed I was not going back away this time I was going to stand proud and confident.  I introduced myself to Tathus.  Tathus was different then the others, funny, warm, friendly, much like the way that Thalandra was when I had met her.  I knew this time I wasn’t going to lose a friend like that.  I began hunting with Tathus more and more.  Tathus had told me of a guild that he had joined; someone that he had met when he was in Faydwer as a young mage had invited him, she was also a druid and he could sense the honor in her.  Her name was Wildkat.  I had told Tathus about meeting Wildkat and Mordeo and how they had brought me here.   I had told him how I had admired Wildkats strength, courage and honor and hoped that one day I could to learn that strength.  I also told him that I would never lose my spirit or my sense of humor.  Tathus and I shared many dreams and secrets, and I had never felt closer to anyone in my life, not even Emteit, or my mother.  Shortly after Tathus and I had become close he had told me that the time had come for him to take his test as a commander for his guild (the Knights of Lore).  He asked if I would be in his division if he got the promotion, well of course I had agreed.  A few days later Wildkat and Mordeo had returned to Qeynos and they had brought along another member of the guild, Dayral, he was to be the one that would give Tathus his test.  Wildkat and I were having a chat while Tathus was completing the first part of the test (a group of questions he had to answer) guess you could say it was like a written exam.  Wildkat had then asked me if I would like to become a member of the Knights of Lore.  Without hesitation I said yes.  Little did I know that I would find myself smack dab in the middle of a new and wonderful family, diverse in content and full of honor. For the first time in ten seasons I had felt like I was home.  Tathus had passed his test as commander; I had become a member of his division, the Phoenix Division.  I had learned from Tathus that Wildkat was the queen of the Knights of Lore, and I knew then why this family had so much honor, she had passed it on to them all, and little did I know at the time, she had passed it on to me as well.  It was at Lady Wildkats wedding that I would also meet the rest of my new family face to face...........  


A long lost family member:


It was the day before Wildkats Wedding that I received a letter from my mother congratulating me on finding my new family.  It was also in this letter that my mother had told me about when she herself had visited Qeynos.  She had told me a tale of a human she had met and fallen in love with many many seasons ago, and how she had a son with this man.  They were never wed and she could take the gossip no longer so she slipped out one night without a word and moved back to kelethin where she met my father.  She didn't know what had become of her son and for many years had wondered if he was doing well.  She had told me in her letter that all she could give me was a name and the hope that one day I would find my brother.  Synlien was his name.  I was upset at the thought that my mother had kept this secret hidden from me for so many years and made a vow to myself to find my brother.  It was at the wedding of Lady Wildkat that my search came to an end.  For there among all of the many knights in my new family stood a tall halfelf druid named Synlien.  Knowing that he had no Idea who I was I decided I would pick my moment to tell him who I was and the truth about our mother.  A few days after Lady Wildkats wedding I found the opportunity to talk to Synlien, I was so very happy that I had found him and a little over excited when I told him who I was.  The funny thing about it is he had already known who I was.  To this day he still hasn't told me, and being his little sister well I obviously couldn't beat it out of him, hell I still can't now. :)..........


Falling in Love:


As Tathus and I grew closer and closer as friends I started feeling more then just friendship for him, although I tried my best to hide these feelings for him. We had been friends through three seasons, had attended the wedding together, and had shared so many secrets that I didn’t want to risk losing that frienship over my girlish feelings… No, I had to be sure Tathus felt the same way.  Tathus was very good a keeping his feelings to himself most of the time.  Then one day after taking down a particularly tough kill I was a little over excited and kissed him.  I remember thinking oh gods this is it the moment of truth how is he going to respond? He looked shocked at first then leaned over and kissed me. I felt my knees buckle WOW what a kiss.  Tathus and I had talked and I had told him of the feelings that I was having towards him and he to said that he had the same feelings towards me.  After I had reached my fourteenth season Tathus asked me to take a walk with him we went a ways from the gates of Qeynos to a little spot where nobody was around, and Tathus got down on one knee handed me a ring and asked me to marry him.  My heart leaped out of my chest and all I could say was yes yes yes yes yes.  Tathus had told me that it was so soon after Lady Wildkats wedding that we needed to keep our engagement a secret for a while, I agreed with him on that.  (I had no Idea how long a while that would be). Shortly after that Tathus and I moved to Freeport together to start our new life..........


Dark Changes:


After four more seasons, when I reached eighteen Tathus finally announced to our family that I had agreed to marry him.  We had even set a date; we would be married three weeks from the day of the announcement.  I had also begun to notice changes in Tathus, he wasn’t as warm and open with me as he had used to be.  I would try to talk to him, and he would snap at me, I would hug him and he would be cold.  I asked him if he wanted some time alone and he had told me that he never wanted me to leave him, he wanted me by his side always.  (a slight glimpse of the Tathus I fell in love with). Tathus wasn’t sharing with me the way he had, when I asked him why he just told me that I would never understand and to stop asking him.  I was becoming angry with Tathus.  I had met another who had many of the same qualities that Tathus had shown in the seasons when was falling in love with him.  The other lent a concerned ear offered support and a shoulder for me to cry on, so here I was the man that I was supposed to marry and had fallen in love with was making me cry, and I had this wonderful other man who was there to dry my tears and make me smile.  I was falling in love with another, or so I thought.  The time for the wedding was drawing near and I knew in my heart that I no longer wanted to marry Tathus.  The thing was how was I to tell the family.  So with all my courage I announced that there would be no wedding...........


Comfort in the arms of another:


The knight that had offered me comfort and support was Sansitac.  Sansitac was there to listen and comfort me when Tathus and I had gotten into a fight and I of course would always be the one to run away crying.  He and I went for long walks on the shore in East Karana while he listened to my stories of how Tathus had changed and not for the better.  He had become the best friend to me that Tathus once was and I knew that I was starting to fall for him.  I couldn’t let that happen again I had to be sure, absolutely sure of what I was doing, after all my heart did still belong to Tathus, even with all the changes and the cruelty I still loved him. Sansitac was very understanding of everything and he would hold me until I would fall asleep.  He was always there when I needed to talk, and offered a warm smile and big hug when I would see him.  I’m not saying that he and I were perfect friends who got along all the time after all I do have a temper, and so does he, but when the fuse got short we would take a break from each other and come back to talk when we’d both had some time to cool off.  When Tathus and I had an argument I wasn’t allowed to leave and if I tried he followed.  The changes I had seen in Tathus had caused me to start to loath him.  I really didn’t want that I knew my Tathus was in there somewhere but where had he gone?  Sansitac and I grew closer while at the same time Tathus was growing darker and darker.  My heart had been broken and Sansitac was helping me put the pieces of it back together.  Sansitac had shown me new places and things and shared with me stories of his adventures.  He fascinated me; he had been to so many places.  One night while we were walking along the shore of the river He stopped me and kissed me, a sweet gentle kiss that seemed to last forever, and I melted. All I could do was to stare into his eyes and what I saw brought a smile to my face and a tear to my eye.  I hadn’t seen that in anyone’s eyes since the day Tathus proposed.  I was enchanted by that kiss.  I was falling for Sans.  Shortly after that faithful night in EK Sansitac had left for a while, he had a quest that he had to do that would take him away from me for a time.  I waited for months and months with no word. I was becoming lonely and my heart was breaking again, this time I had to put it together on my own.  This time I swore to myself that nobody was going to break it again..........


Wild Oats:


Well here is where the saucy comes in.  I was intent on doing what I wanted when I wanted and wasn’t going to let anyone tell me otherwise.  Sure I had many friends, Including Emteit, that were after my heart.  
This time my heart belonged to me, for the most part, but there was always that one piece of it that would always belong to Tathus.  Perhaps I felt as if I should hurt Tathus in the same way that he had hurt me, I felt maybe I should break his heart the way he had shattered mine. I just knew that it was time that I stopped dwelling in the past and started living my life the way I wanted.  I knew that the only way to do that was to have my fun and let love sit aside for a while.  I found my way into Lady Wildkats tavern one evening and found myself a little tipsy and surrounded by a bunch of very cute very eligible bachelors.  Wildkat of course helping me along with the drinks, and lets not forget pushing me onto a table and saying dance. J It wasn’t until the night that Wildkat had pushed me onto the table and turned my clothes into shear veils that I discovered the back rooms in the tavern. I had been up on the table dancing when I asked if any knights were brave enough to join me. One brave warrior stood up and said I don’t know how to dance but I will try… thus began a wonderful affair with Dheseroh.  I shall spare you all the details on this one folks, but if you know lady Wildkats back rooms well then you know what I am talking about.  I have even found myself in one of those rooms more then once with Tathus.  Sometimes a little bad can be a good thing.   Since then I have left my family in the Knights of Lore and helped to build a new one with Lady Wildkat, Mordeo, and Tathus.  I have seen many of my family from the KoL come into the tavern for good times and laughter. Now you know how I have become the saucy serving wench I am today.    So the only question left now is will I ever settle down and give my heart away again? Well my friends that is a question only I can answer, and I ain’t saying. Guess you will just have to wait and see..........
