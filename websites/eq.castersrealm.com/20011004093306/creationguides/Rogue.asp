<p>Rogues are the more shady class in the world of Norrath.&nbsp; They have the
skills necessary for survival in dangerous territory and the ability to pack a
mean punch into whatever crosses their path.&nbsp; But make no mistake, Rogues
are an offensive class, not defensive.&nbsp; If you force a rogue to tank for
too long they will die, and die fast.</p>
<p>Rogues generally use piercing weapons for fast and deadly combat.&nbsp;
Another factor to this is because Rogues generally swing a lot, using heavier
weapons such as swords will quickly drain their stamina.&nbsp; In combat they
also have the abilities to dual wield, double attack, parry, riposte and disarm.</p>
<p>They get the unique ability to backstab.&nbsp; This skill can be used about
every eight seconds, and can do massive amounts of damage.&nbsp; The only trick
is that the enemy must have their back turned to you, and because of the damage
you dish out it can sometimes be hard to get it to attack someone else and give
you an opening.&nbsp; Thankfully Rogues do get some skills to help you do this.
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to lower the taunt caused by their damage output, Rogues have the
unique ability to reduce the monsters hate for them so that it attacks other
targets.&nbsp; This allows them to reposition themselves for further attacks,
and also reduces the damage inflicted on them.&nbsp; They are also able to
instill fear against most enemies causing them to run away.&nbsp; As the monster
flees they can attack the enemy continuously from behind without the monster
fighting back.&nbsp; This helps a great deal in soloing or grouping,
particularly if the mob has been snared and cannot move quickly.</p>
<p>Rogues can both hide and sneak simultaneously.&nbsp; With these abilities
they can slip past most creatures in the world undetected, which is another key
benefit of the class. They are the only ones able to move past the prying eyes
of living and undead beasts at the same time.&nbsp; Not even caster classes can
do this.&nbsp; This makes them the ultimate class for scouting and corpse
recovery.</p>
<p>Rogues also have the ability to poison their enemies.&nbsp; The effects of
these vary depending upon the type of poison which has been used.&nbsp; This
helps to add a little variety to the class, although the process of making
poison is very difficult, and can get very expensive.&nbsp; They also have the
ability to pick locks and disable traps.&nbsp; This skill is becoming more and
more important in the newer areas of Norrath.</p>
<p>Rogues can also make a lot of money very quickly through the use of the pick
pocket skill.&nbsp; It is generally not considered good etiquette to use it when
grouped since it takes money away from the other members of the party, but when
playing alone can you make serious cash from this ability.</p>
<p>Rogues also get critical damage on thrown weapons, although this skill is not
used enough to be a significant damage dealer.&nbsp; They also receive some
impressive disciplines after level 50 which you can view <b><a href='http://eq.castersrealm.com/disciplines/list.asp?Class=Rogue'>here</a></b>.</p>
<p>There are some drawbacks to being a Rogue.&nbsp; They have much lower
hitpoints than the warrior, and since they cannot wear platemail, also have a
much lower armour class.&nbsp; This greatly reduces their ability to tank, and
without a healer around or someone to take the blows, a Rogue can die very
swiftly.&nbsp; Because of this they are generally poor soloers, and forced to
group.&nbsp; Unlike Monks, Rogues get no skills to help them recover health
faster, and their downtime is almost as long as a warriors if travelling alone.</p>
<p>Overall, Rogues are a fun class to play, but they are one which is certainly
a challenge.&nbsp; Able to dish out a lot of damage and perform skills no-one
else can does however make them a welcome addition to any party, particularly at
higher levels.&nbsp; If you have the patience for this class, then you will
certainly reap the rewards as you grow in power.</p>
        <p><b><font color='#800000'>Statistics</font></b></p>
        <p><b>Strength:</b> Strength determines how much you can carry.&nbsp; It
        influences maximum and average damage and how quickly you learn many
        offensive skills.&nbsp; For a Rogue, strength is the most fundamental
        statistic.&nbsp; It increases the consistency of damage output, as well
        as helping the Rogue to improve their skills.&nbsp; It also impacts on
        the damage done by backstabbing.&nbsp; You should assign the majority of
        your bonus statistics here.
        <p><b>Stamina:</b> Stamina affects how many hit points you have, and how
        long you can hold your breath.&nbsp; It also affects how long you can
        swing weapons before tiring, and how often you can jump before becoming
        exhausted.&nbsp; Whilst stamina is an important statistic, Rogues
        generally are forced to group after around level 20 in order to maintain
        exp efficiency.&nbsp; As a result, one of the support classes can
        normally ensure they do not become fatigued during combat.&nbsp; Whilst
        the extra hitpoints are nice, there are not enough gained by the
        assigning of your bonus points at creation to make it truly worthwhile.&nbsp;
        <p><b>Agility:</b> Agility affects how quickly you can learn some
        defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much
        damage you take when you are hit.&nbsp; The true effect of Agility is
        often debated.&nbsp; Whilst adding points to your Agility will increase
        your overall AC, it will not be a great deal unless you assigned the
        majority of your bonus points to this statistic.&nbsp; This would mean a
        lower overall damage output since you have reduced your base strength,
        but would mean you had a chance of lasting slightly longer in combat.&nbsp;
        It is certainly true that a high AC is something to be aimed for, but we
        recommend that the extra Agility is not worth the loss in Strength.&nbsp;
        Agility is still a statistic very worthy of considering as for
        allocating your remaining bonus points.</p>
        <p><b>Dexterity:</b> Dexterity affects how quickly you learn weapon
        skills, and how often weapons will do their special attack.&nbsp; This
        is another very important stat for Rogues.&nbsp; Most Rogue classes
        already have an innately high dexterity.&nbsp; Most high level weapons
        have special abilities which help to deal more damage during combat.&nbsp;
        As a result of this a high dexterity is something which is always handy.&nbsp;
        There are also a number of items and buffs in the game which help to
        increase your overall dexterity.&nbsp; Putting bonus points into
        dexterity is a very viable choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Wisdom:</b> Wisdom affects the amount of mana the priest classes
        have, also rangers and paladins.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since most Rogue races have
        higher Wisdom than Intelligence they should look to buff this statistic
        when doing trade skills.&nbsp; But it is not a statistic to invest your
        bonus points in..
        <p><b>Intelligence:</b> Intelligence directly affects how quickly you
        can learn most skills.&nbsp; It affects the amount of mana for bards and
        all pure casters, as well as shadow knights.&nbsp; Like wisdom,
        intelligence is only useful for skill raising for Rogues.&nbsp; Dark
        Elves, Gnomes and Half Elves should consider buffing this stat if they
        are doing trade skills.&nbsp; It is not a statistic to increase with
        your bonus points however.</p>
        <p><b>Charisma</b>: This affects amount you will be paid for goods by
        NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you.&nbsp; This will impact
        upon the costs incurred when purchasing food, water, and bandages.&nbsp;
        It is not a statistic to be concerned with during creation.</p>
        <p><font color='#800000'><b>Picking the Right Race</b></font></p>
        <p>The first thing you have to pick then is your race.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which
        race you pick will determine the foundation of you character for the
        rest of your life in Norrath so it is kind of important you pick one you
        like.&nbsp; Most of the rogue races are quite well suited to the class,
        but there are some differences to note.</p>
        <p>Wood Elves, Dark Elves and Gnomes all have low strength however which
        is a large hindrance to to the overall damage output of the class.&nbsp;
        Barbarians and Dwarves on the other hand have quite high strength which
        is a definite bonus.</p>
        <p>Halflings level slightly faster than the other rogue races, whilst
        Barbarians level slightly slower.&nbsp; Barbarians do however get the
        ability to slam their enemies both interrupting casting and giving a
        short stun.&nbsp; They can also wear both large and medium armour, and
        use the large racing throwing weapons.</p>
        <p>Barbarians and Humans are the only races with no night vision,
        however you can find items in the game which will remove this
        deficiency.&nbsp; You should also note that Dark Elves are generally
        hated through most cities of Norrath.</p>

        <p>Generally speaking being agnostic is a fairly safe bet in Everquest.&nbsp;
        Religion serves only to get you into trouble in many situations.&nbsp;
        The disadvantage to doing this is that some items and some quests can
        only be done by followers of certain religions.&nbsp; Following a
        religion will at worst get you killed in some areas, but generally you
        can avoid these.&nbsp; Following Innoruuk is probably the most dangerous
        religion as they have the most places in the game where they are Kill on
        Sight.&nbsp; In the end it will not make an enormous difference to your
        character which Deity you choose.&nbsp;</p>
