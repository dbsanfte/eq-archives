Ch. 20 Because I Love You<br>
---------------------------<br>
<br>
The Kirosawa danced on the ground, dropped accidentaly due to
shock. In all this time, he never imagined what he would see in
coming to the Sky Plane. He told himself that nothing could stop
him, nothing could keep him from attaining his goal. And was he
wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Arorua..Your alive..&quot; Raziel gets a hold on himself
and moves to hold her. But a blade of mana halts as it presses
against his breastplate.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not another step Mortal. Less you feel this blade pierce
your innards.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Arorua. It's me Raziel. Don't you recognize me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop your prattling, Mortal and begone from this
realm.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Arorua. Why are you doing this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because she belongs to me&quot; a voice spoke from beside
him. A very familiar voice. He turned to face the voice. It was
she, the same winged assassin who had killed Arorua<br>
<br>
&quot;You!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You remember me. How nice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Arorua withdraws her blade and kneels. &quot;Milady
Veeshan.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;What have you done to her, you wench!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Temper, temper! I have turned a traitorous little mongrel
and turned her into a glorious defender of the heavens. Which is
quite allot considering her crimes&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What crimes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For starters. Having the poor taste in choosing you as a
mate. Second daring to bring about the Twilight by bearing your
child. But as you can see, that has been taken care off....&quot;<br>
<br>
She wanted to stop Leylia from being born..but she was too
late....but what could an innocent child do to Veeshan? What is
the Twilight?<br>
<br>
&quot;In fact you should be thanking me mortal. I could have let
your wench's soul to torture forever in Fear. But I am quite
generous. And just to prove it. If you simply kneel before me.
I'll let you return to Norrath. If not...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I kneel before no one. Mortal, God, or whores of Planes
such as your self!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;IMPUDENT MORTAL!!&quot; Raziel was instantly thrown back by
Veeshan's power. He sailed through the air and was slammed into
another flying island.<br>
<br>
Veeshan's voice began to boom across the Plane. &quot;You dare to
ridicule at me! I will beat you into a bloody mess and pour salt
on your wounds! I will make you suffer for millennia and I will
then take your soul! Your kind has flourished so long that you
have lost respect for me. Your creator! Your master! I created
you too serve me and that is what you will do!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tough talk for a harlot..I bet you don't even have the
power to decide whether to spit or swallow!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;SILENCE!&quot; The island explodes in a blinding black
flash. In a few moments, the dust calms and begins float
aimlessly. In the center of the remnants of the isle. Is a mana
barrier encompassing Raziel. The barrier shimmers for a moment
then fades away. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kill him! Cut him to pieces! Destroy him my servants!&quot;<br>
<br>
Several flashes shine out of the distance and streak toward
Raziel. &quot;Kirosawa return!&quot; Raziel outstretches his hand
toward the ground and the demon-blade materializes in it. And
just then a large guardian drake appears in front of him. It
rakes its large claws across Raziel's breastplate, creating a
shower of sparks. Raziel fades away and appears above the drake
and sends the Kirosawa through its back. It screeches madly as
the demon-blade quickly steals the drake's life force. With a
swift motion, the Kirosawa is ripped from the drake and it begins
its long trip below. Two more drakes pincer in on Raziel,
entrapping him with their claws. The drake's pause for a moment
to gather their strength, then breath their scorching flames at
Raziel. <br>
<br>
But Raziel is no longer there, and he fades into sight in front
of the drakes and then cuts them into two. His body spasms
violently as several bolts of lightning slam into him. He begins
to plummet toward another island. The three Djinn's hurl more
great bolts of lightning at the falling Raziel. Each one
connecting and thrusting him deeper into the rock. After several
more spells, the Djinn's stop casting. They wait for the dust to
settle, and suddenly a hole appears in the dust cloud and one of
the Djinn's cries out as he is cut two.<br>
<br>
Before the others can react, Raziel sends the Kirosawa through
the head of the second Djinn. Spilling its brains across the
floating islands. Using the time, to ready itself the remaining
Djinn clasps onto Raziel and then plummets down to the island,
pile-driving them both deep into the rock.<br>
<br>
For a moment everything is till once again, then a bright black
flash fills the Plane of Sky. Signifying the destruction of
another island by Veeshan. But as before, Raziel hover in the air
encompassed in barrier of mana.<br>
<br>
&quot;I tire of this Mortal. Guardian. Kill him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Milady Veeshan.&quot; Arorua glows brightly for a
moment then she leaps toward Raziel with her mana blade held
above her head &quot;FOR VEESHAN!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
And then the Kirosawa and the mana blade collide sending out
shockwaves of power.<br>
<br>
&quot;Arorua! Stop this! &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut your clucking tongue mortal! You had your chance to
live!&quot; Arorua slashes and thrusts at Raziel several times,
each meeting the demon-blade. Raziel propels himself backward
trying to evade her attacks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop your running coward!&quot; Arorua shines brightly and
begins to hurl a blitzkrieg of magical energy at Raziel. Many of
the bolts go wild and strike outlying islands, but most slam into
Raziel as he desperately tries to shield himself from her
attacks. Soon she stops and resumes her assault with her blade.
Driving him onto one of the islands. She hacks at him with
blinding speed as they begin to jump from island to island, all
the while Raziel parries and dodges her onslaught. But he knows
he can't do this forever.<br>
<br>
&quot;Arorua! Please! Stop this! Please Remember! Remember our
journey together! Remember our love for each other! Don't make me
fight you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Quiet! Stop your running and fight! At least die with
dignity!&quot; They continue on, going from island to island with
their duel and soon the stop on one. And continue, Raziel's
strength rapidly fading, he continues to defend, but soon
completely exhausted Arorua drives him down to his knees.<br>
<br>
She stands above him. &quot;You were almost a god fight mortal.
But in the end that's all you could ever hope to be. Now you die
for transgressions!&quot; She readies herself and makes one final
charge.<br>
<br>
And it was over. Blood begins to lightly splash on the ground,
then a steady stream. And with a sickening tearing sound, Raziel
rips the Kirosawa from Arorua's stomach. She holds still for a
moment, letting her blood beginning to flow even freer upon the
ground. Then she collapses into a heap.<br>
<br>
&quot;Arorua!&quot; The Kirosawa clangs on the ground as Raziel
cradles Arorua gently. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
Arorua's breathing begins to slow, and the light in her eyes
begins to fade and in the moment Veeshan's hold breaks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Raziel...thank you..&quot; She smiles at him and is still.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.....Not again.... DAMN YOU VEESHAN!!!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who would have thought that one of Cazic-Thule's lackey's
could contain so much power? But it matters not. You have proven
yourself to be quite strong, therefore you shall be quite a
welcome addition to my servants.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not a chance.&quot; He lays Arorua on the ground and stands
up to face Veeshan. The Kirosawa returns to his hands. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh. Still some strength left? I like someone who can go
several times. Lets see how much you got left in you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Veeshan raises her hand and points toward Raziel. And a giant
wave of energy leaps forward and encompasses him. His barrier of
mana holds for a while, then it breaks away. The wave begins to
burn at his armor and pushes him backwards. The attack continues
pushing right to the edge of the island. Raziel fights the attack
and then manages to leap out of the wave. He plummets toward
Veeshan, trying to send his blade through her. But her own
barrier protects her. The barrier uses his own strength against
him and propels him away, crashing him to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmph not bad. Let's try that again.&quot; She raises her
hand again and another wave surges over him. He once again fights
against it, but his strength finally gives out, his armor
shatters, and he collapses into the wave. And just then it stops.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it seems we have found your limit. You should have
known better then to fight a god.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pain...unending pain..All this way..to fail? To watch her die
again....Arorua......There is nothing left for me to fight for..I
have lost her twice...Theres no point in going
on........Leylia..Yes there is a reason. I must do it for her. So
she can live a good life..I must fight!<br>
<br>
Raziel stirs and slowly begins to get up.<br>
<br>
&quot;O so you're not done yet? Good. I haven't had any fun in a
long time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I suggest you remember the last time. Cause..&quot;
The Kirosawa forms back into his hand and he stands up.
&quot;You're MINE!!&quot; He cries out and a bolt of lightning
strikes him. White-hot flames leap about around him, and he is
now fully encompassed in his armor once again.<br>
<br>
&quot;What!?! You should be out of power!&quot;<br>
<br>
*<br>
&quot;Think about it on your way to eternal agony! DIE!!!&quot;
The Kirosawa pulses a blinding black stripping the island of all
it's light, then Raziel leaps for Veeshan.<br>

-----------------------------------<br>
Special Thanks and Closing Thoughts<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
Thanks go out to all of you who have supported me and kept me
going! You're the best! Special thanks go to the lovely Arorua
Kaya! Proud member of Solar Prexus! (Solar Prexus is one of the
best guilds on Prexus; it's up there with Black Magic and Unity).
Who has helped me spell check (boy did I need it) and grammar
check the story and she was always ready to berate me for a silly
mistake. ;) Also special thanks goes out to Endless Nitemare, who
made the great picture of Raziel!<br>
<br>
And so after all this time and posts. The epic tale The Shadow
Falls: The Hell Lord Chronicles comes to an end. I hope (hope? I
know) that you have enjoyed reading the story as much as I have
writing it .../sniff I almost hate to stop typing, but the time
sadly has come. Thanks again to all of you! Be well!<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------<br>
Little Known Factoids (Told you I couldn't stop)<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Four of the characters in the story are actual Players. Raziel
(me), Arorua, Caerdwill (King Thex's advisor. Caerdwill is an RL
friend and the leader of Fae Sindlehelion on Prexus) and Meya
(Raziel's sweetheart early on in the story. Meya was the first
person I ever met or grouped with in EQ. Hence, she was Raziel's
first Sweet heat in the story)<br>
<br>
2. The story took 3 months to right and is over 120 pages long.
(That's allot of typing)<br>
<br>
3. Contrary to popular belief, The Hell Knight class used in this
story, is in EQ. While not as an actual NPC or usable class. It
is mentioned twice by story NPC's. One is in Odus, one is
antonica. As too who and where specifically, well that's for you
to find out.<br>
<br>
4. This is all that will be typed.<br>
