  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p>Geldor&#146;s Guide to Playing a <br>
Young Human Shadow Knight from Freeport<br>
So you want to try the dark side, eh? Well, following find a
guide to the first few levels of starting a human Shadowknight in
Freeport. <br>
Level 1: You start in West Freeport like everybody else but your
home is really in East Freeport in the slums. Before you start
killing things take the time to memorize the layout of Freeport.
Take particular care to develop a route from the West Freeport
newbie zone to the East Freeport slums that avoids passing any
character with an honorific in front of their name. If you see
Sir or Lady above a characters head RUN! I was randomly killed by
several Paladins at levels 1 to 3 before I developed that 6th
sense that told me that someone had a lot of Orc in them. Guards,
on the other hand, are generally okay, they won&#146;t be civil
to you but they won&#146;t kill you either. <br>
Well, you&#146;ve looked and looked and you can&#146;t find the
SK guild. The guild note says it&#146;s in East Freeport in the
slums in the basement of a condemned building, but the only
condemned building has a locked or jammed door. I spent an hour
searching for it with another newbie SK. Finally, he gave up in
disgust. I was sure that the guild was where it was advertised,
based primarily on consistent guild-type casting sounds, and
continued to search. I&#146;m not going to spoil the search for
you but I will tell you that it IS in the condemned building and
it IS in the basement and the entrance is via a secret in another
adjoining building. Have fun searching&#133; And if a SK newbie
asks where it is don&#146;t shout the location to him. Tell him
or better yet lead him to it. Followers of Innoruuk are not well
liked in Freeport and we need our refuges. <br>
So, we&#146;ve found the guild, gotten our tunic and we&#146;re
ready to bash! Actually, not quite yet. Two things remain: <br>
First, you need to map out the underground of Freeport so that
you can move around easily. It&#146;s dark so I recommend killing
a Firebeetle for an eye, which appears to be better than a torch.
Also you don&#146;t have to hold the Firebeetle eye in your hand,
just having it out in one of your open inventory slots activates
it. The Underground includes exits in East Newbie, West Newbie,
The Docks, and the Harbor. There are also several ways to get to
North Freeport, which is important because the Paladins that
guard North Freeport will kill you on sight. I haven&#146;t
accurately mapped these yet so there&#146;s work to be done. <br>
Secondly, speak to every NPC in the underground, several have
quests that will advance you and one in particular will help you
to level much faster. Hint: If you do her quests you won&#146;t
be selling most of your loot, you&#146;ll be turning it in for
equivalent cash AND XP instead. I leveled to 4 and 6 while
transacting with her. I think she gave me a 15-20% boost on
overall XP earned prior to level 6 and this made up for the SK
penalty. <br>
You&#146;ve now spent an hour or two setting up your SK and
grounding him or her in Freeport. Time to hit the newbie zones. I
recommend starting in West Freeport because it will dramatically
reduce your run time after dying and you&#146;ll probably die a
fair amount. Watch out in particular for the Orc Pawns, who like
to ambush you while you&#146;re fighting another creature.
Firebeetles also gang up on you but only if you&#146;re fighting
another Firebeetle or an Orc Pawn. <br>
Anything that CONs blue or white is a viable target but watch out
for the helpers. Stay in West Freeport until you&#146;ve reached
level 3. Kill Fire Beetles as soon as you can because of the
superior XP and other benefits associated with them. Other prime
targets are Decay Skeletons, because of the Bone Chips and
weapons that they carry. Finally, kill Orc Pawns, kill many of
them. They also give okay XP and carry weapons now and then, but
the primary benefit is with the commons folk who will treat you
more kindly as your faction goes up. This can really help with
trading later on. <br>
Get a Rusty 1H slash weapon as soon as possible and also a 1H
blunt. If you get lucky and acquire a Cracked Staff keep it as
your 1H blunt, it&#146;s the best 1H blunt for this level.
However, don&#146;t use only your primary weapon to fight. Keep
switching back and forth between 1H blunt and 1H slash, you&#146;re
going to advance slower than normal because of being an SK and
you need to bring those skill levels up. It&#146;s very
frustrating to get to level 6 and have to slowly bring up 1H
slash because you became so enamored of the Cracked Staff. <br>
By the way, the reason that I&#146;m advocating one-handed
weapons is that your Bash (level 6) is going to become an
important element of your game later on and as a human you have
to have a shield equipped to bash. Some players suggest that SK&#146;s,
who don&#146;t get Dual-Wield later on, should use 2H weapons to
get maximum effect from their Double Attack skill. I disagree.
The Bash is so important against spell casters later on that you
can&#146;t afford to give it up. You will sacrifice some damage
at lower levels but when you can afford well-balanced weapons
later on this effect is minimized. <br>
At level 3 it&#146;s time to visit the East Commonlands or
Northern Ro. Your targets this time are primarily Spiderlings for
the XP and Spiderling Silk, and Firebeetles who still provide
good XP and of course those wonderful Eyes. Decay Skels are now a
secondary target but still useful for chips and weapons. If you
have a choice try not to spend too much time on the Black Wolves
and Armadillos, they give good XP but generally very poor loot. <br>
Begin to buy odd pieces of leather armor as the opportunity
presents. I skipped patchwork armor completely and I recommend
this course as you should be largely outfitted in leather by
level 6. <br>
One of the things that pulls at the young SK is the need to hit
the optimum (blue or better) targets at all times. Your
advancement is significantly slower because you&#146;re a hybrid
class. I found that green targets were just not feasible unless
the reward (staff, weapon) outweighed the time spent. Decay Skels
are an exception because they die in 2 or 3 swings and the chips
are worth a lot to a young SK but other than that I avoided
greens even if nothing else was in sight. I just kept hunting.
The net effect is that you&#146;re not as rich as the average
young character and this was the thinking behind skipping
patchwork which costs 2 plat to outfit completely. <br>
Level 4 expands the target choice to Black Bears and Coyotes. I
only attacked these if they were white, for the XP. Loot is
minimal from these and I treated them like wolves and avoided if
anything else blue or better was available. <br>
A note on Harm Touch: This does (your level x 10) +1 damage to
white conned and below targets. It recycles every 60-75 minutes
(approx.) and whenever you die. Before level 6 do NOT be afraid
to die. I would typically stand in against a white creature down
to my last half bubble before using Harm Touch. SK&#146;s need to
take risks to advance quickly and prior to level 6 there is
virtually no XP loss when killed. This is another mechanism for
catching up to other character types in advancement. If you&#146;re
running for the guard you&#146;d better have a darn good reason
(very long run to get corpse, no idea where you are, etc.) I did
find myself reflexively running for the guard when double teamed
until I realized the best solution was to use Harm Touch to
finish off the critter in front of me and then gracefully accept
the retrieval of my corpse. You die, HT comes back, along with
full HP and you&#146;re ready to go. In addition to which you get
the XP from your dying kill. By level 5 there are situations in
which dying just seems like the natural course of events. This
also makes for GREAT roleplaying of an SK, you&#146;re just
practicing for the undead thing later on&#133; <br>
Level 5 is a tough level. Your best hunting ground is probably
the Northern Desert of Ro. Well, at least the first set of Dunes.
The problem is that there are several creatures wandering the
desert who will kill you fast. Watch out for madmen. They hit for
20+ and home in from an impressively wide range. I finally
learned to leave the dunes and rest by the guard after my second
unfortunate sitting encounter with a looney. Give mummies a wide
berth, if they hit you they can inflict rabies and there&#146;s
nothing more miserable than a rabid SK. <br>
Another sidenote: Go anonymous, do this at level 1 and keep it
on. Many players will heal or cure an anonymous player, virtually
nobody likes a Shadowknight. Decloak now and then so that a Troll
or Dark Elf can WHO you. Trolls are good buddies for hummie SK&#146;s.
Dark Elf Necros are also natural allies. Treat Trolls and Dark
Elves the way a good character would treat good races. Roleplay
the nasty but do nice things for your allies. This will pay off
big time later on when you begin to think about killing Dwarven
Guards and the like. <br>
Enough of the bad stuff, this is what you CAN hunt in NRO at 5.
Orc Raiders, Jackals (in the dunes) and Spiderlings (in the green
belt). Orcs tend to pop in in groups of 2 or 3 and then patrol
out on their own. When you initially spot a cluster, follow one
of them and ambush him when he gets out of sight of the others.
If you get jumped by a couple of Orcs use Harm Touch to kill one
and then get ready to retrieve corpse. It takes just as long to
heal to full as it does to retrieve corpse and you don&#146;t
have HT available instantly if you survive. Prior to level 6 don&#146;t
try to survive. Living is for suckers&#133; This also applies to
getting jumped by a Puma while fighting another creature. Make
sure you kill the one in front of you and then go visit Innoruuk
for a little while. <br>
If the hunting is poor in NRO you have another option. You can go
back to East Commons and kill Bears and anything else that CONs
white or blue. Continue turning in quest items until level 6. Don&#146;t
get frustrated, 5 is just a bad level, 6 will be much better. <br>
Once you finally reach level 6 your horizons broaden. You can now
hunt well into the dunes in NRO, virtually all the Orcs are
killable, Pumas are now a target for good XP. Things just look a
lot better. And you have another option: A human SK is able to
hunt in Nektulos Forest. The guards will glower at you but as
long as you don&#146;t hail them they won&#146;t attack you. I
tend to hunt the white skels at the end of the left path over the
bridge, they give excellent XP. <br>
If you followed the one piece of leather at a time strategy you
should now be at AC 130 or more and most white creatures will
have some difficulty hitting you. I am exclusively hunting white
creatures and feel that my level 6 advancement is similar to my
experience with other non-hybrid characters. <br>
Update: Well I reached 9 last night. Time played was almost
exactly 36 hours, which is similar to time played at 9 for my
Barbarian Warrior and Wood Elf Druid. At this point I think the
human bonus and hybrid penalty are cancelling each other out. <br>
Levels 6 through 8 were spent exclusively hunting in the northern
dunes of North Ro, with an occasional foray into the flats to the
south. The primary targets were Orc Raiders, often 2 or 3 at a
time, Pumas and blue Jackals. The creatures in NRO are relatively
docile (except for Pumas, Madmen and Mummies) or slow chasers.
The Madmen and Mummies can both be outrun to zone if you take
care not to look back. Guards will kill Mummies but Madmen
frighten them so you NEED to zone. Yellow Pumas are the biggest
threat because you can&#146;t outrun them or outfight them. Look
to other players for help or go visit Innoruuk, we&#146;ve done
that a few times&#133; By level 7 no Pumas will be yellow. <br>
I found that after level 6 I basically hit everything in sight
that was not Poisonous (more on this later) or Yellow/Red. The
problem is that the blue creatures (mostly Pumas and Jackals with
the odd Orc Raider) carry very little loot. This means that you
need to hit the green Orc Raiders whenever you see them. Geldor
has earned 30 pp as of the beginning of 9 and probably half of it
came as a result of weapons or armor taken off of Orcs. <br>
Fighting as a Shadow Knight takes on new dimensions when you
reach level 6. The biggest change is that Bash is now available.
Many guides list it as level 12 but it actually shows up at level
6. I put 1 training point into it and let it advance naturally
and by the middle of 6 it was close to max. The effect of Bash is
to let you inflict additional damage approximately every 2nd
round. Initially I was bashing for 2 or 3 damage but as the skill
level improved I began to see up to 8 damage. Combined with Harm
Touch you can now take on 2 blue creatures simultaneously and
handle selected white creatures with ease. My level 6 SK felt
very similar, if not superior, to my Warrior when he was 6. <br>
At 6 and above you have the option of fighting blue/white
poisoning creatures, like Rattlesnakes and Desert Tarantulas.
These are very good for XP but I really recommend avoiding them
unless you&#146;re desperate. The reason is that they cause a lot
of downtime due to poison. Being at 3 bubbles of health after
killing a Puma or several Orcs is very different from being
poisoned at the same health level. <br>
Notes on movement and sighting in the desert: Stick to the
ridgelines. Visibility is key and you don&#146;t want to get
caught in a wadi (desert gully) when a big nasty comes over the
ridge. In addition, use 3rd person perspective when fighting and
resting. I use the zoomed out mode and virtually never get
ambushed. Remember that Alt-Arrow key rotates the view without
moving your character. When I fight I always have a guardian
angel looking over my shoulder. I also try to drag my prey up
onto a ridgeline after snaring it. The payoffs are many; in
addition to security you often get the chance to scout your next
victim while you&#146;re still killing the last and finally, 3rd
person perspective is one of the coolest things about this game.
I&#146;m really amazed at what Sony/Verant/989 has accomplished.
Make sure to watch at least one sunrise and sunset in this mode,
they&#146;re much superior to the first person view. <br>
I find myself spending less and less time in the underground at
this point. The quests that are related to Freeport require a
higher level SK so they&#146;re back-burnered for the moment.
There was one particularly cool quest that I did at level 5 that
required a jaunt to the West Commonlands. Talk about adrenaline.
There&#146;s nothing in the WC that won&#146;t smear a level 5! <br>
As I sit at level 9 my only real concern is what to do with all
the silver and copper I&#146;ve accumulated. The one service that
I really don&#146;t have access to is a Bank. The Vault is in
North Freeport and I&#146;m KOS there. I&#146;m not sure that I&#146;ll
be able to physically carry enough money to the Gypsies to buy a
combine in a few levels. Right now spurs aren&#146;t the only
things in the desert going jingle, jangle jingle. <br>
A few corrections to points made earlier: I gave up the notion of
maintaining high skill levels in both 1h blunt and 1h slash. I
found myself taking too much damage from creatures early in the
level, which would cause downtime and also noticed that even with
an INT of 85 I was rarely maxing out my combat skills by the end
of the level, probably an effect of being a hybrid. I&#146;m
currently a 1h slash only SK and my skills (offense, 1h slash)
are always maxed at the end of the level. I&#146;m beginning to
think that the hybrid classes level at the same rate as the other
classes if you&#146;re very disciplined and restrict your play
choices to narrow advancement paths. <br>
I also under-reported the AC effect of Leather. I was actually at
160 at level 6 and am currently at 208 at the beginning of level
9. This is a 10% or better improvement over Patchwork based on my
experience with other characters. White creatures hit me about
33% of the time and blue creatures have trouble hitting me at
all. It&#146;s not unusual to fight 2 blue Orcs simultaneously
without losing a half bubble of health. <br>
At level 7 I began to care if I died. On the bright side very few
things that I chose to attack from that point on had any real
chance of killing me. I did suffer 2 deaths at level 7. The first
was completely accidental; while running to East Freeport at 2
bubbles of health I bumped into a madman returning to the desert.
Well at least it was quick. The second was my fault. I decided to
kill a white rattlesnake with 4 bubbles of health and HT
available and was poisoned 6 times in the opening moments of the
battle. I used HT to kill with a bit more than 2 bubbles left and
then sat down and watched 70 hp go away to poison. Oh well, you
die and learn as they say&#133; <br>
Harm Touch updated: I have now used HT often enough to say with
confidence that it will not be resisted often by white and lower
creatures. In fact I&#146;ve only had it fail to do maximum
damage twice. Both times against white creatures at level 7, once
it did only 61 points instead of 71 and once it did half damage. <br>
When Harm Touch is available I&#146;m substantially stronger than
a fighter of the same level. When it&#146;s not I&#146;m a little
bit weaker. I now find myself hanging onto HT longer because as
long as I have it up I can solo white creatures without fear.
When I&#146;ve used it it&#146;s back to the blue things for a
while. The fighters will become better at melee than me when they
reach 15 and get Dual-Wield and Double-Attack and I hope to have
a few leveraging techniques to make up the difference by then.
Hopefully the pet will suffice. <br>
Last, but not least, I think it&#146;s a mistake to hunt in
Nektulos Forest at these levels. I haven&#146;t died there yet
but there are several factors that add up to trouble. All of the
guards glower at you with the exception of the halfling deputy
who glares threateningly. Also the night-time visibility is
really quite poor for a human even with a Firebeetle eye. I
blundered into a very red Kodiak in the darkness at one point and
was saved only by the timely intervention of a DE guard as I ran
through the forest at 2 bubbles and declining. I am going to
visit the foreign quarter in Neriak but for now I have stopped
hunting there. <br>
Part 2: Geldor's Shadow Knight Battle Tactics<br>
At level 9 and through level 15 a human shadow knight becomes
quite a fearsome solo player. The elements that come into play at
9 include a pet, which at level 3-5 is quite sufficient to either
help with damage or lead the initial assault. Siphon Strength,
which appears to significantly weaken creatures, particularly
when cast multiple times. And Disease Cloud, which does 5 pts of
damage per casting and prevents regeneration of hp as well. <br>
When you combine these new elements with the existing melee
skills of a SK (strong weapon damage and Bash) and, of course,
Harm's Touch, you have an extraordinary amount of damage
potential in one package. <br>
The tactics that I employ to achieve maximum effect are as
follows: <br>
After I've reached an area that I expect to find white or
selected yellow prey in I cast Leering Corpse. Frequently I
fizzle a few times but eventually my pet emerges from the
Netherworld. Each fizzle requires a small amount of downtime to
recover mana but the material component (2 bone chips) is not
removed unless the spell casts successfully. <br>
At this point I have the pet engage a few lesser creatures (Decay
Skels, Firebeetles, Spiderlings, etc.) and carefully track the
damage it's doing. What I'm looking for is 12 pts of damage per
round. This indicates a level 5 pet that will be able to fight
well against higher level foes. I never intervene in the battle
myself because I don&#146;t care to save a weak pet. SK pets are
roughly half the level of the SK so there's no other way to gauge
their effectiveness, they all con green to you. While I'm
evaluating the pet I regain most of my mana and if the pet is
suitable I'm ready to hunt. If not, I reclaim it and summon
another. Repeat until level 5 shows up. <br>
Once the hunt has begun I have 2 primary target types. The first
is any non-poisonous or disease causing white target. The second
is yellow targets that meet the above requirements and also do
melee damage only. I select targets carefully with two thoughts
in mind: 1) I want to have predictability in the combat sequence
so I only engage casters under optimum circumstances, and 2) I
want to minimize downtime after combat so I avoid the poisonous
and disease causing mobs that create extended downtime. <br>
After selecting my target I decide which of the SK battle plans
will be most effective. <br>
The predominant plan involves an armed pet, preferably with a
rusty 2h sword, scythe or halberd. The primary concept here is to
use the pet as an extra damage source throughout the combat. To
this end I make sure that I am always the target of the mob and I
do whatever I can to save the pet. Combat generally proceeds
along the following lines: <br>
1. I draw the mob to me by casting Siphon Strength. I have
auto-attack on and frequently I get the first blow in as it
charges. <br>
2. The pet engages and I carefully maneuver so that I am on one
side of the mob and the pet is directly opposite me whacking away
at it's backside. This is a delicate procedure because 3 hits
from the mob will destroy the pet and given that this is the plan
in use against yellow mobs I am in trouble if the pet dies. Note
that the mob is deep red to your pet if it's yellow to you. <br>
3. I taunt and, of course, bash at every opportunity. This is
critical because you have to build up damage and hatred early on.
The pet is doing a consistent 13-19 pts of damage with it's 2h
weapon and the mob WILL turn on it and destroy it if you don't
keep the damage and taunts going. Remember that the pet is
striking from the rear and as a result it hits nearly as often as
you do. I use a Mino Axe as my primary weapon and even the
relatively short delay compared to the pet's 2h weapon barely
equalizes the damage. <br>
4. Eventually, the pet will draw the mobs attention. The damage
that pet does combined with the taunts that it produces every 3rd
or 4th round are just too much to be ignored. As soon as I see
the mob turn I cast Disease Cloud and then Siphon Strength again.
And then I do everything I can to redraw it's attention. The best
method is to quickly run around in front of it and interpose your
self between the mob and the pet. You cannot get the mob off of
your pet from the rear. This is the most important moment of the
battle because if you can't save the pet you usually won't win. <br>
5. If the pet has died, which happens occasionally, I use Harm
Touch immediately to assess whether I need to run or have a
chance to win. If the pet lived, I now gradually, very slowly,
begin to shift away from the pet. I am trying to turn the mob
around by degrees until the pet has a rear attack angle again. If
in doubt that I can accomplish this without having the mob
refocus on the pet I just fight side by side with the pet until
the battle is over. The pet is not very effective from a front
facing. If I think that I have no chance to win I won't waste
Harm Touch. I'll just run suddenly while the pet is still there
to block for me. I get a 2 second head start as the mob finishes
the pet and this will usually get me to zone. <br>
This plan works perfectly against white mobs and very well
against the selected yellows also. It's an almost guaranteed win
against Sand Scarabs in North Ro and I leveled from 10-12 very
quickly there killing the yellow ones. <br>
The second SK battle plan is used primarily against white and
loot-rich blue targets. This plan involves pet sacrifice and
therefore I usually don't arm the pet when I'm using it. The idea
here is to use the pet to minimize downtime afterwards without
having it take an experience cut from the battle. The sequence I
use is: <br>
1. I order the pet to attack the mob. <br>
2. After it has engaged I cast Siphon Strength and Disease Cloud.
<br>
3. I join the melee and begin to taunt and bash. Normally the pet
will be near his last legs at this point. <br>
4. If the mob is still focussed on the pet I cast Siphon Strength
again. At this point the pet will die and I'm soloing the mob
with the benefit of several hits from the pet and the spells that
I was able to get off. <br>
5. Normally I kill the mob with 4 bubbles of health left. If
things get out of hand I will Harm Touch but usually I win
handily and have a minimal downtime afterwards. <br>
Both of these plans work well against appropriate targets. It's
important to note that the first plan should only be used, and
yellow mobs should only be attacked, when Harm Touch is
available. You actually only need to use HT about 10% of the time
but it's hard to make accurate tactical decisions in it's
absence. Too often a mob will suddenly frenzy when it gets to 25%
health and start hitting you for insane amounts of damage. Given
that you need to run at about 2 bubbles if you're going to make
it you often have to leave a combat early for safety when HT is
not available. <br>
One question that remains unanswered is whether Siphon Strength
cumulatively subtracts from opponent, it's not cumulative on me
in terms of adds. I've noticed that there seems to be a big
difference in damage that an opponent can inflict after I've
Siphoned several times as opposed to just once. <br>
I have yet to run from or die to a white creature while soloing
using these tactics, and generally the down time afterwards is
minimal. Which, at levels 9-15, is a significant improvement over
my Barbarian Warrior, who usually won against white creatures but
was substantially bloodied, and my Wood Elf Druid, who was unable
to reliably melee solo white creatures on a consistent basis. <br>
I'm going to briefly go over again the killing yellow targets
sequence so that I don't get anybody killed. <br>
In order to kill a yellow melee opponent four things must be
true: <br>
1. The target must be melee only. No casters, no poisoners and no
outrageous damage mobs. Sand Scarabs, Young Kodiaks, Orc
Warriors, lone Dervishes, Dreadbones and Greater Skels all
qualify. Griffawns, named NPC's and Ghouls don't. If in doubt
don't attack. <br>
2. The pet must do significant damage, if pet dies early you can&#146;t
win. Pet needs to be attacking from the rear most of the time.
This creates better damage and less chance of pet death. <br>
3. You must be able to cast Siphon Strength before you or the pet
engages. I've seen significant evidence that casting it several
times has a cumulative effect. <br>
4. Harm Touch must be available for emergencies. <br>
If all of these are true you'll win 80% of these battles. If any
are not true you can't win. The one death that I experienced at
level 9 was due to a weak pet that collapsed after 2 hits and a
series of stuns that occurred thereafter. If I'm really confident
near the end of the battle I'll take off auto-attack and back
away and let the creature kill the pet. I've noticed a minor
improvement in XP when the pet doesn't survive the battle. <br>
Obviously this tactic gets slightly less effective at each
subsequent level until 15 due to the pet becoming less effective.
At about level 13 I had to begin to really carefully parse
opponents because the pet was 10 levels below the target and
might be unable to do damage depending on target type. Note that
when you reach the level you get an interesting effect: The pet
now does less damage against yellows but is also 10 or more
levels below them meaning he takes NO experience from the pool. <br>
Other Young Shadow Knight Issues<br>
I think I've solved the Human SK No Bank problem. I'm throwing
money away instead of banking it. Seriously, I decided to try
Smithing with Geldor and he's now a very poor boy. 70 plat, or
7000 silver to be more accurate, has turned into 54 smith levels
(trained to 21 and then raised to 75 while using the skill.) With
most characters I would not recommend Smithing, as the eventual
reward does not add up to money and time spent in my opinion. For
a human SK however Smithing may be a good way to turn
unmanageable sums of loose change into skill levels that will add
up to real money later. HUGE Update: Guards in Neriak in Commons
are now Apprehensive although the Guards outside are still
Glowering. This means that Geldor has access to the Bank in
Neriak and to the vendor who sells Ore. I don't know if hidden
factions caused the change or if it was in a patch but Human SK's
just became better than Dark elves in my estimation. I also don't
know if an early level Human SK would have the same faction.
Geldor was not accepted in Neriak Commons at level 9. <br>
An offshoot of the Smithing is that I've found a reliable route
to Groflah's Forge in North Freeport. It involves using the sewer
system to move from West Freeport to North Freeport and then a
short run to the forge. Take great care to avoid the NPC in front
of the Bard's Guild, he doesn&#146;t like SK's very much. <br>
The bank in North Freeport is still off limits because of the
Paladins who guard it. <br>
The West Freeport sewers are extraordinary. The sewer system
appears to be completely separate from the E Freeport/W Freeport
tunnel network and there are several huge chambers available
(much larger than anything in the tunnels.) I would make one of
these the site of any large gathering of Dismal Rage type PC's.
One thing that I'm still looking for is an exit from the original
tunnels to West Freeport that's inside the city. The only exit
I've found so far is to the newbie grounds. <br>
Neriak also has a brilliant hidden tunnel system. There is a
direct connection from the SK Guild in the Foreign Quarter to the
Toad Stool in Commons. This network probably has hidden branches
that I haven't discovered yet. <br>
At 15 I still believe that the human SK is not only a good class
to play early on but might well be one of the best. I highly
recommend this race/class combo. The only thing I would change if
I had it to do over would be my sex. Female characters seem to
get a lot more help from other players. <br>
I'm now splitting time between 3 characters so Geldor's progress
has slowed some. I'll definitely publish another look at human
SK's when I hit 22 but that might be awhile. <br>
<br>
One thing people might be turned off by is the fact that humans
suck. This is not true. Humans are nightblind and there stats are
average but they can still become quite good. Perhaps a human
will never have the spectacular strength an ogre or troll does,
but between you and me, who wants to be an ugly troll. 'I' tried
a troll and i personally did not like his appearance. I think
this is half of what you should be looking for. Just my two cents
on which race to pick. <br>
