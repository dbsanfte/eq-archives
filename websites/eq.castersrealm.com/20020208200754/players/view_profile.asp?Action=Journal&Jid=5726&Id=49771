  <tr><td class='db'>The Oaths of Felishanna<BR>
==================<BR><BR>

Intro<BR>
====<BR><BR>

I have put a link to this article on my signature at last. This will probably be good and bad, as more people will likely come here. For those who you who do not know me, the roleplaying is only one aspect of the game. I might come across as harsh 'in character' to those who play 'evils', but it is just that, 'in character' only, and if ever you want to /tell me in the ooc sense, feel free, I like to think I'm usually pretty friendly. :) <BR><BR>

This said, this article is very defensive in places, as it is not only aimed at informing friends and nice people I meet in EQ of the restrictions this character must play by, but also of placing my stake in the ground for the unpleasent section of the community who come into EQ with their own demands and expectations of others.<BR><BR>

After reading what follows, in most normal adventuring, single group hunting, and large multi-group raid situations (where there are significant numbers of good aligned characters), as long as my companions are aware of the rules, they seldom cause any problem whatsoever. Indeed, when with friends, the subject seldom comes up anymore. Indeed, Felishanna has been on MANY raids, and I like to think she has made a good contribution as a cleric to almost all of them. :) <BR><BR>

The Oaths Themselves<BR>
=================<BR><BR>

Soon after the death of her father in the war in Tunaria, at the time she completed her acolyte training and was elevated to a cleric of the Mother, Felishanna made a number of solemn oaths. These can be summed up as follows: <BR><BR>

(1). Felishanna has sworn to vehemently oppose and fight Innoruuk and all his minions, whenever she has reasonable opportunity.<BR><BR>

(2). Felishanna may never knowingly/willingly directly assist or take assistence from those of Evil alignment.<BR><BR>

(3). Felishanna may never knowingly/willingly hunt or kill creatures of Good alignment, nor assist others in doing so. [Most especially, she will *never* assist in any way on any attack on the Plane of Tunare].<BR><BR>

(4). Felishanna must on regular occasions return to Greater Faydark, and assist in the defence of the Elven homelands (by helping the young elves and other allies of Light) against the orcish threat, or any other that threatens the Elves of Fawdyer.<BR><BR>

As a roleplayer, I try my utmost to keep within these at all times. This is in addition to the (more commonly accepted) code of honour to others that many players follow with their characters.<BR><BR>

Impact<BR>
=====<BR><BR>

It is number (2) above that causes the most impact on gameplay. It means:<BR><BR>
a. No grouping with evils.<BR>
b. No directly helping evils (heals/buffs/rezzes).<BR>
c. No taking direct help from evils.<BR>
c. Never receiving Summon Corpse from Necros/SKs.<BR>
d. Receive no twitching from Necros willingly.<BR><BR>

Some will read this and say: <i>Are you serious?</i> The answer is: yes, very serious. I have always had these rules, and although in my earlier levels (pre-20) I did not apply them well or uniformly (I had not yet really figured how I would play it all at that point), after that time I kept to them more strictly. When I realized how much criticism I would receive from the players who hate roleplaying, I realized the only way to play it was to have <b>zero</b> exceptions, and this I have rigidly enforced since I reached about level 39. <BR><BR>

You don't believe me? Think again. The moment that Felishanna will take, for example, Summon Corpse from a Necromancer is the day I must delete this beloved character of mine, for she is destroyed in my eyes. This is how I play. It does mean however, there are things she will never be able to do, that is a price I am willing to pay.<BR><BR>

The situation with normal groups (of up to six characters) is easy - Felishanna will not group with those she sees as 'evil' for whatever reason, as to gain benefit from such, or to assist an evil by such, would be against her principles. Indeed, the only time she has even tolerated the presence of an evil in a group for even the shortest time is in a situation where neither gain any conceivable benefit from the other (and is this rare!).<BR><BR>

Who are 'Evils'?<BR>
===========<BR><BR>

Evils come in two forms:<BR><BR>
Class 1: all Necros, SKs and DE Clerics.<BR>
Class 2: all other DEs, Ogres, Trolls and Iksar.<BR><BR>

Class 1 evils are the worst, of course. These characters have CHOSEN freely to follow and advocate evil. Any attempt by them to say otherwise is merely an attempt at subterfuge.<BR><BR>

Class 2 evils, whilst not necessarily <i>active</i> advocates of evil, are condemned by their evil blood and heritage.<BR><BR>

Class 2 evils who are agnostic do have a chance to <i>raise faction</i> with Felishanna, if they try hard enough to convince her by words and deeds that they do not follow the dark path most members of their races adhere to. This is not an easy path, and <i>very</i> few have managed it (non-roleplayers would be unlikely to want to spend the time). Indeed, very few have tried (more than in passing). Raising faction with Felwithe clerics to even Ally is not enough - Felishanna is her own faction.<BR><BR>

Multi-Group Raids<BR>
=============<BR><BR>

Here it gets more tricky. As a player, I realized that there was a balance to be made. And there are grey areas that make it hard and sometimes I have to make a judgement call (and occasionaly I get it wrong and have to rethink later). I try above all things to be consistent (and yes, I have made mistakes, sorry, I'm human (in real life lol).<BR><BR>

On the one hand, I want to roleplay, and will stick to my single-group rules to the letter within my assigned group.<BR><BR>

On the other hand, as a player, I also want my character to be able to do things that involve more than one group - much of EverQuest is based on fighting enemies that take larger forces. I am not and never will be a 'raiding' player, and so would not suit the large raiding guilds, but I would like to do some raids sometimes. :) In a world where almost no-one is a strict roleplayer (<1%), it was always going to be totally impossible to expect to find raids that had absolutely zero evils in them, since they represent a sizable proportion of player characters, and in a non-roleplaying world, 'evil' in a roleplaying sense meant nothing to most, even if it mattered to my character.<BR><BR>

How did I balance these conflicting desires? Well, I came up with a set of rules stating what Felishanna would and would not accept, and I stick to them rigidly. In a perfect (100% roleplay) world, the compromise would not be needed, but in the real Lanys-Norrath, there was no other choice except to forever condemn my character to never going on any raids at all. Anyone who has any sense will understand this reasoning (even if they do not like it).<BR><BR>

So, the rules are as follows:<BR><BR>

1) In any raid Felishanna LEADS, there can be NO evils at all.<BR>
2) In any raid that is planned SOLELY (or mainly) for the benefit of Felishanna, there can be NO evils at all.<BR>
3) In any raid LEAD by an evil, Felishanna may not attend.<BR>
4) In any raid where the number of evils present is such that the raid is inviable without them, Felishanna may not attend.<BR>
5) In any raid where that is planned SOLELY (or mainly) for the benefit of an evil, Felishanna may not attend.<BR>
6) In any raid where Felishanna is requested that she must be prepared to accept a Summon Corpse spell and/or Necromancer twitching, she may not attend.<BR>
7) Felishanna may attend all other raids, even if there are a few evils also on the raid, as long as she keeps her oaths with regard to the group to which she is allocated, and provides no <i>direct</i> assistence to and recieves no <i>direct</i> assistence from said evils, no matter what the circumstances.<BR><BR>

For example, then, Felishanna may attend a raid where there is a (possible) benefit for a necromancer, as long as the direct purpose (in Felishanna's judgement) of the raiding party is not to benefit that necromancer, but rather that it is just one of many possible outcomes of the raid. In a similar way, she may attend a raid where there is a (possible) benefit to herself, even if there are evils on the raid, as long as the direct purpose of the raiding party is not specifically for her benefit.<BR><BR>

The other thing I have to look out for before sending Felishanna to a multi-group raid where there are 'evils' in other groups is the presence of at least one other non-DE cleric who will 'look after' the 'evils' and still can themselves be looked after by Felishanna. If there are none, she will not attend (as she is forbidden for example to rez those evils should they die). If there are some, but they all leave the raid, Felishanna must also leave at that point.<BR><BR>

Addendum: Added a new consideration. I found Felishanna in a position she had never been in before yesterday: on a multi-group raid with only one enchanter who was dark elven. After consideration, this needs to be checked for before attending a raid in future as well. Whilst being on a raid without enchanter mana-regen is not impossible (clicking it off when I notice it cast on me, easier than a public argument on the subject :) ), it reduces her effectiveness significantly.<BR><BR>

If you don't like this compromise, sorry, but this will remain what I play to. I do not explain these rules in order to persuade readers to like them, only to present what they are publically, as so many ask me so often (some in a friendly way, some in a decidedly unfriendly way). I have chosen this path so that on the one hand I can still roleplay, and on the other, that I can still have a chance of taking part in big multi-group encounters. <BR><BR>

Some raid leaders will not accept my restrictions, I respect this and stay away. Luckily for me, a few are more roleplay friendly and are prepared to, even if they themselves do not roleplay. Thankfully not everyone is roleplay-intolerant.<BR><BR>

The Plane of Hate<BR>
=============<BR><BR>

The home of Innoruuk, Felishanna's great arch-enemy. For this one place ALONE in Norrath, Felishanna has a special rule, to enable her to be able (in theory) to visit there more easily, and so make her fulfilment of her First Oath more often a reality.<BR><BR>

The rule is this. Class 2 evils can be considered <i>temporary</i> allies for the duration of such a raid. This means she can (though she will strongly prefer not to) accept assistence from and give assistence to Class 2 evils. This is one way a class 2 evil can even attempt to raise faction with Felishanna, if they so wanted to.<BR><BR>

Why Roleplay?<BR>
==========<BR><BR>

Simple. It is what EverQuest is designed for. And it is great fun! Ignore the powergamers, immerse yourself in the story. You might like it. :)

Yes, some of this is open to interpretation. Yes, some of it can get into grey areas. And yes, most of all, some could pick holes in anything and everything. Well, I play to have fun not argue with others, I will always try to interpret my own imposed rules honestly, and this is, as I have said, not a debate.<BR><BR>

Another roleplayer may make this balance in a different place, one that is right for them. This is only my way, it is no better or worse than any other way. :) <BR><BR>
