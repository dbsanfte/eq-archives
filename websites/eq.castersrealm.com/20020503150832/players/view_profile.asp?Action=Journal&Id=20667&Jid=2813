  <tr><td class='db'> </td></tr>
  <tr><td class='db'><P>The day the King sent her away was a sad one for Sharlis. As she gathered her things together to prepare for the journey ahead, she wondered what would happen to her.</P>

<P>About noon that day, two guards came to Sharlis to escort her out of the city. Together they walked through the long hallway between the castle and the forest. Sharlis had seen the dark forest before, but had never ventured too far.</P>

<P>Standing right at the entrance of the city was the stranger that had shown great interest in Sharlis the year before. He was a high elf, and looked very old - almost ancient to Sharlis. His white hair contrasted his dark eyes. He did not smile, in fact his face was expressionless. His only greeting to Sharlis was a slight nod of the head towards her.</P>

<P>The Stranger began speaking to the guards in a language that Sharlis did not understand. Then, with a nod and a salute, the guards sent Sharlis on her way to be with this stranger.</P>

<P>Immediately, they began to follow the windy path through the forest. Sharlis tried as fast as she could to keep up with this man, who was able to run significantly faster than she, despite his age. What a scary place this was! Enormous bats seemed to be swooping in on Sharlis, and in the distance she could see giant wasps. Beside a tree stood a lone skeleton, it's eyes glowing yellow at Sharlis. She had heard of such creatures roaming the dark forest but she had no idea it was so scary!</P>

<P>For a few moments, the path seemed to be clear. Suddenly, Sharlis heard a loud growl and someone shouted "Filthy High Elves like you must DIE!" She turned to look, and chasing right after her was the ugliest creature she had ever seen! She let out a small cry as adrenaline kicked in and she began to run for her life!</P>

<P>In a split second, she could feel something striking her shoulder. Then another strike to her back. She stumbled over her own feet and fell to the ground. Scrambling to get up, she felt a strike at her head, another at her knees which knocked her back down again.</P>

<P>She heard soft music in the distance and suddenly a bright light surrounded the creature, and it stopped attacking! Sharlis scurried to get away from the monster, and saw that the Stranger had cast his magics on the creature to make it freeze. She heard the stranger softly chant words of magic she did not understand, and a loud thunderclap filled the silence. Suddenly the monster began choking! The next second it was dead.</P>

<P>Sharlis sat down to compose herself and catch her breath. The stranger walked up to the corpse and began searching its clothing. Sharlis leaned in to get a better look, and realized she had seen that creature before in a book. It was an...</P>

<P>"Orc" said the Stranger. "Orc Pawn. Pesky little things really. Generally not worth my time"</P>

<P>He walked over and sat beside Sharlis.</P>

<P>"Have some water, child. Compose yourself"</P>

<P>Sharlis noticed a coldness in his voice.</P>

<P>"When you are calm, we shall continue the journey to Kelethin"</P>

<P>'Kelethin!' thought Sharlis. She knew that her wood elf cousins lived there. All her life, she had seen wood elves come to visit Felwithe. Never before had she been to visit them.</P>

<P>"Come, get up. Let us continue" said the Stranger.</P>

<P>Together, they continued on to Kelethin. To Sharlis relief, there were no further interruptions along the way.</P>

<CENTER>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</CENTER>

<P>At first, Sharlis did not see Kelethin at all. All she saw were trees and a ramp guarded by two wood elf guards. Nearby she saw a Priest of Discord. She recognized him because another of his kind resided in Felwithe. Her mother had always warned her to stay away from them - they were bad she said. Sharlis turned away, so she did not have to look at the Priest.</P>

<P>The Stranger tapped her on the shoulder to get her attention. When Sharlis turned to look at him, she saw he was pointing up.</P>

<P>Above her was an ENORMOUS tree city! She had no idea the wood elves lived in such a place! Excited, she tagged along behind the stranger as he pressed a button at the top of the ramp.</P>

<P>A large platform came down from the sky! Sharlis was timid to step on it at first, but the stranger pushed her onto it. Then, it was going up up up into the sky! Whee! What excitement for Sharlis! She could see miles and miles of forest and treetops. The lift stopped, and Sharlis didn't even notice, she was so busy looking at the view. The stranger grabbed her by the hand and pulled her off the lift.</P>

<P>She tried to follow him as best as she could through this treetop city. He seemed to know his way pretty well, as he went over bridges and up and down ramps. Suddenly, he was completely gone and Sharlis was left alone.</P>

<P>She began to wander, in hopes that she would find him. While looking for him, she started talking to the merchants she passed along the way.</P>

<P>"Hello Sharlis" they would say. "Would you like to buy a batwing?"</P>

<P>"H- How do you know my name?" She asked, surprised.</P>

<P>But they did not reply. She declined on the batwing and continued on her way. Suddenly...there was no floor where she thought there was! Down she plunged into the forest below! With a cry of agony, she blacked out.</P>

<CENTER>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</CENTER>

<P>Sharlis woke up in front of Felwithe, dazed and confused. Out of fear and shock, she felt tears coming to her eyes. Then, she heard someone laughing.</P>

<P>"Heheh Sharlis, you alright?"</P>

<P>It was one of the Guards, who had noticed her condition.</P>

<P>"Nnn..no" Sharlis stammered.</P>

<P>The guard began laughing loudly at this point.</P>

<P>"I'm guessing that you fell from the city of Kelethin right?" he asked.</P>

<P>"I think so..I don't know how I ended up here though" she replied.</P>

<P>"Ahh missy you've just had your first death! Welcome to the world outside the city walls" He returned to his post, and Sharlis could still hear him laughing as he walked away.</P>

<P>"Come on. You've had enough fun for one day" it was the stranger, who had suddenly appeared out of nowhere.</P>

<P>"Wait, I have some questions" Sharlis began - but he wouldn't hear it.</P>

<P>"In due time Sharlis. Not now" He replied</P>

<P>"But -"</P>

<P>"No. Get up, follow me closely and yell if you lose me"</P>

<P>He began to walk away. With a sigh, Sharlis stood up and followed him into the forest.</P>

<CENTER>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</CENTER>

<P>They arrived at Kelethin as the sun was going down. The Stranger brought her to an inn, and followed her into her room.</P>

<P>"Here, take this" He said, as he tossed her a backpack.</P>

<P>"I will return when the sun comes up. We have a long journey ahead of us tomorrow so get some rest."</P>

<P>Closing the door behind him he left Sharlis alone.</P>

<P>In the backpack were a few items that Sharlis found fascinating. There was a dagger, and a green robe which Sharlis recognized as a spell casters training robe. There was a red book, a loaf of bread and a flask of water. What really caught Sharlis' eye was a small stone - small enough to fit in the palm of her hand. It glowed, and lit up the room.</P>

<P>After a yummy dinner of bread and water, Sharlis decided to lie down. She tried to rest, but at first she couldn't. She kept going over the day's events, and kept wondering what might happen tomorrow. She was so deep in thought, she did not notice that her eyelids were getting heavy. Before she knew it, she had fallen asleep.</P>
