  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>Well I have been playing a paladin for a long time and these are just some of the things that are in my head. This is a small guide for a HIE Paladin. Well you start in Felwithe and will be hunnting outside the city in Greater Faydark I found that this was good till you hit about 2, I advise that you continue to hunt there till lvl 4 unless you know the area quite well then I say about lvl 3 go to Kelethin and hunt around the first and second lifts when you get about 5 go to the third lift and start witht the orcs, and work your way till about lvl 10 
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 1: before I go too far the weapon you want to use as a young paladin till lvl 10 should be a two handed slash type, because as a young paladin you are nothing more then a weak warrior till lvl 9, then you get your first dose of spells)
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 2: make sure you use taunt as lvling this will benfit you more later on when you will need to be used as a absorbshion sponge to save a fellow group members life.)
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE  3: make sure and place skill points into bash and some into one handed slash, make sure to also put skill points into all spell skills before you use them you do not have to put many cause you are a high elf and learn very fast.)
 <BR>
<BR>
After lvl 10 you may want to try crush bone, but in my findings the Dervish Camps in the Desert of Ro seem to grant better exp, the reason beeing that the groups there often do not die as much as other places and the exp seems to be steady, this is good, you can hunt there till about lvl 15 and make some decent money, which comes into play after 15.
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 4: after lvl 15 a good idea if you have not already is to get a two handed slash weapon that is magical that can hit certain types of undead, and if you have enough money it is good to get also a one handed sword that is magical with a magical shield.)
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 5: if you do get a shield and sword combo remember to palce bash in the commands list, my sugestion is to make to sets of battle comands in the 1st and 2nd sets, one for one handed slash and the other for two handed slash this will help greatly when you switch weapons in battle.)
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 6: when to use bash, well it is good to use bash while fighting caster mobs cause of the stun effect it is very well when it might stun the caster and give the group a few extra seconds to finish the target off.)
<BR>
<BR>
Welll you are now a lvl 15 HIE paladin with a new set of spells, I have found that the undead are a good target now that you can nuke them and not have to just swing at them, so I sugest that you head back to Faydwer and to the Estate of Unrest and find a group along the outside walls of the house, and just pound the undead till you can get to lvl 20. use your undead spell ward undead as much as you can while hitting the target this will help in how fast you group can pull. A though is do not use fear undead while fighting keep it memed as a last resort if you have to run. this comes in handy when there are a lot of trains being pulled and you got to move cause you do not want to be the there next lunch. If you can always try and get a group at the back of the house in unrest cause trains do not come too much out of back, at least not the worse ones comming from the basement, they tend to drag creatures that you do not want to be chased by. 
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 7: try to start ulternating between one handed and two handed weapons. Use bash on casters and two hand on regulars, just make sure you have used some skill points in one handed slash and in bash.) 
<BR>
<BR>
Well after you hit 20 it is good cause you now have some money so I sugest to start thinking about some armor, this is a time you want to leave unrest cause the exp has slowed and you are starting to become too high, or too low for unrest mobs. It is best to head out to the local city of Kaladim and pick up your lvl 22 spells and toss them in the bank. Once you do that head out to the docks in Butcher Block and take the shuttles on the left dock. Get aboard the big boat and sit back till you reach Kunark and get into the wonderful outpost of Firiona Vie. Stock up on supplies and head out to Lake of Ill Omen. Fight at the pillars till about lvl 25 in group then start grouping the Sarnak Fortress and killing them till lvl 28-29.
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 8: you now get your third dose of spells so start useing root to help out the group and hold runners.)
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 9: when you get to the city of Firiona Vie try and get spirit of wolf and invisibiility spell cast on you so that when you go out of the city you do not get attacked by the drachnids, or other creatures that tend to lay in your path.)
<BR>
<BR>
After you reach 28-29 venture out from the Lake of Ill Omen and head to to the Frontier Mountains and start grouping the giant fort, the giants drop lots of good loot and this is when you should start to get armor cause the flow of money is quite nice, when I was grouping there I could haul in from 30-100pp which is nice. The giants are not casters so before heading out to the fort make sure and place your one hand slash weapon and shield in the bank. This is so you can carry more and hit harded. I sugest you stay here till 30 as then you should take a break from the giants cause you have just hit your first hell lvl. There are 2 things that can be good, just up to you on which you wish too do. The first is if you wish to solo the hell lvl which can be nice, to do this go back to the Lake of Ill Omen and kill all around the pillars and solo singles outside the fort this is a can be a fast, or slow way for you, all up to you on this way. The other way is to head back to your younger huntting ground of unrest, you just have gotten your fourth dose of spells, which of course include Expulse Undead a new 90 something DD for undead, along with this comes stun a great tool to stall running creatures while you hack you last blows into the target. You also have greater AC and HP buffs so now you can handle damage better. In unrest you want to group and kill creatures from the 2nd floor, or from the basement. In no time you will be 31 and gotten threw your first hell lvl. I would advise you to stay here till you reach 32.
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 10: When considering buying gear make sure and pay mind to STR, AC, and WIS. strength cause of the amount of dmg done from blows, you will never do the most dmg but you want to be on the lvl and one of the disadvantages that HIE have is lower STR. AC is good so as to help in the damage taken. Wisdom is not to importent scince you have the highest, but a little more can not hurt.)
<BR>
<BR>
Now that you have hit 31-32 you want to head back to the Giant Fort in Kunark and continue there till you hit lvl 35. Where you no longer need to use your book to med. You now can see the puller comming back with your next target, which is nice cause we all get sick of blind medding. Well this is your second hell lvl and harder then 30, I say you now need to move once again cause exp at fort just will not do, you need to now move to the zone called Overthere. Group there till lvl 40 and the loot is bad so I hope you saved some of your money, group around the place called the ledge there are usally a lot of groups and the exp is nice. You will then be playing more of your role as a damage sponge, so do not be afraid to get hit.
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 11: There are Guards in the Overthere and you must be very careful cause the do very nasty dmg to anyone that is not evil and you are one there hit list, they are called Dragoons, goons for short so when some one says they around move.)
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 12: after you hit 39 you get your fifth dose of spells so you may find yourself being a healer so work on you skills in that area, as you are just as good as other classes in healing, WIS is a big factor in healing so play the role well.)
<BR>
<BR>
Once you hit 40 you will want to hurt cause this is the first nasty hell lvl you want move and go to the zone called the Dread Lands and group through out the zone till you hit 50, you want to group the ridge located by the ruins get into group and fight till about lvl 45 then after lvl 45 you want to group a place called KFC, just ask some one in dread lands zone for a loc and head there till you get to lvl 50.
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 13: you want to work on the skill disarm so make a button and use it, I know it does not seem like it ever works but it will.)
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE 14: try and be the best damage sponge around and give buffs to group members if no cleric and heal the puller to save clerics mana.)
<BR>
<BR>
Well boys and girls this is the best way I found to work your paladin, it of course is all up to you and what you make of the EQ exp. I will one day write a guide for 50 to 60 for a HIE, just still working bugs out, also a quick NOTE before I quit typing you must relize a paladin is good and that being a HIE is a pluss cause one day you may carry Natures Defender and the is one of the best weapons so remember about two handed slash and that you are part elf. </td></tr>
