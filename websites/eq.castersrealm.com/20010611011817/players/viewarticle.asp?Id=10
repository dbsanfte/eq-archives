<p>“Agg, my head”, I muttered clutching my forehead in deep meditation for
several minutes. Gradually it dawned on me that the pounding I felt more then
heard, came from outside my hung-over appendage.</p>
<p>Sitting up, a little faster then prudent, I winced and opened my eyes to see
a hammer, large as Tribunals come crashing down with a splash at the foot of
what appeared to be a boat.</p>
<p>“Boat?” I blearily belched, staring disdainfully at the water, still
rubbing my head.</p>
<p>“Hmm”, I tried to peer through the wool that filled my mind, as well as
my mouth. I remembered entering Freeport with a full purse, looking for a place
to buy herbs without having to sneak back into Halas again. Then a smell of
roasting mammoth followed by Ale, then ogre swill as the funds diminished. There
was a vague recollection of a gnome in there, that’s right he was celebrating
something and was more then happy to buy a few more. At some point the sound of
the meat being carved in the Taverns kitchen reminded me of more painful
memories. A vision of my fathers startled face as my spear went through him. The
noise it made.</p>
<p>That’s when I started to drink seriously.</p>
<p>I lurched slowly to the rail of the ship and emptied my stomach noisily.
After hanging there for some minutes large shapes passing the ship finally made
an impression.</p>
<p>Crash! The entire ship lurched. My head shot up towards the front of the
ship.</p>
<p>“Ack, damn” I said grabbing my temples in pain, as the hammer at the
front of the ship came down on a small mountain of ice. Slowly painfully I made
my way to the front of the ship and marveled at the path it was carving through
the ice. What had appeared to be one hammer was in fact a water wheel of them,
each nearly as big as I was.</p>
<p>“Gnomes…” Shaking my head in wonder, and not a little pain. I started
looking around the ship only to discover, to my horror, that it was abandoned.
There was no sign of captain nor crew. Nor, after panicked search, did I see any
sign of a means to steer it.</p>
<p>“Well if this ship is about to reach the end of the world, at least it will
stop my accursed head from pounding.” I sat down rubbing my temples, content
to watch the small islands of ice pass. Try as he might I could not recall
boarding the ship. With a shrug I started to doze, it wasn’t the first time I
awoke in a strange place, and at least this time there wasn’t a bear in bed
with me.</p>
<p>After some time I awoke again, the sun beaming down in my face, my head
mercifully subdued. Stretching, and scratching I walked over to the rail to do
my morning ritual.</p>
<p>“Mind pointing that spear somewhere else?” Came a voice from out on the
water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startled from my business, I looked down to see a gnome standing on a dock.
It wasn’t until that moment that I realized that the ship had stopped next to
an island of ice far larger then I had seen up to this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If yer fer getting off better do it quick. That boats about to leave”</p>
<p>As if on queue the great hammers descended again and the ship launched
forward. Taking a moment to secure myself, I jumped over the side and onto the
dock. Slipped on it’s icy surface and landed flat on my back slamming my head
against the dock.</p>
<p>“Damn”, I clutched my skull again. The gnome that had greeted me stepped
up to my head and blocked the sun. Staring down his long nose said “Better
watch your step, its slippery round here.”</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>I quickly determined the dire hardship (no Beer) these gnome pirates lived
under. The terrible conditions of their settlement (no Ale) and shortage of
supplies (no Vodka!), I decided to head off towards the dwarven city (mmm
dwarven Ale), which they told me was no more then three days journey west. I
quickly restocked my pack with some food (the bread the spirits provide can keep
a man alive, but it pales before too long).</p>
<p>I bid my host farewell after less then a day in their company. A day spent in
the company of grown gnomes play-acting as pirates is far too much to endure.
Now my uncle Olaf, there was a pirate… but that’s a tale for another time.
Shouldering my pack and enjoying the brisk air I set off.</p>
<p>I was debating the merits of summoning a spirit guide for company, when it
seemed the very snow before me grew teeth and claws. A cat twice the size of the
leopards of home leapt from the snow straight at my face.</p>
<p>“By Brell’s Hairy Arse” I yelled dropping face down into the snow, as
the cat passed over me. Rolling over, I poked the cat a few times with the sharp
jade point of my spear just to make it wary, and give me a second to breath out
the mouthful of snow.</p>
<p>The cat circled me as I stood, I could see some other cats a ways off, all as
big as this one, watching the fight with interest. This would need to be quick.</p>
<p>Beginning to chant quietly slowly, I called the spirits to hold firm the cats
back paws to the ground. Judging by how agitated the cat became the spirits
answered my call. The cat although immobile still managed to swipe away any jabs
I made with my spear. I chanted again, slowing the creatures attack and was
finally able to score some hits.</p>
<p>“This is one tough cat” I muttered. I chanted again calling the spirits
of frost and plague hurting the cat even further. Finally one decisive thrust
through the cats heart killed it. I quickly skinned the cat and took a claw as a
reminder of this fight.</p>
<p>I thanked the spirits and received their healing as welcome. My request for a
flagon of ale for pain relief brought no reply however, making me wonder if
indeed the spirits were all the wives and sisters of fallen shamans, as my uncle
used to remark. “Sure they’ll heal ya up right fine, but look for a tot o
whiskey to ease your sufferin and there’s nary one to be found”</p>
<p>After chanting the tale of the wolf I ran to the edge of this island and
jumped from ice flow to ice flow to get to the next. I decided that I had put
enough space between me and the snow with teeth and claws.</p>
<p>Resigning myself I began the chant, which would bring a companion from the
spirit world. This was a long chant and about half way through I missed a beat
making me start over again. The end of the spell left me on my knees panting for
breath feeling drained as it always does.</p>
<p>From this vantage I could see four paws standing before me. Catching my
breath I looked up to see a wolf guide before me.</p>
<p>“Oh its you again…” the wolf growled managing to sound sarcastic.</p>
<p>Damn, the spirits had sent Jobner again. Jobner had always felt that the task
of companion spirit was beneath him, as were the shamans who called him from the
spirit realm.</p>
<p>“Yes its me, o powerful spirit”, Rolgath could be sarcastic too, “Guard
this spot while I prepare a fire and dinner”</p>
<p>“As you wish o mighty one”, the wolf sneered.</p>
<p>I sighed, as I prepared dinner under my companion’s scornful eye. it was
going to be a long journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-3-</p>
<p>“Wake up you fool”, Jobner’s ghostly cold nose woke me from deep
meditation. “We have company”</p>
<p>Around the circle of light that the fire provided stalked a pair of red eyes.
About 3 feet off the ground, accompanied by a vaguely canine growl.</p>
<p>“Its just a wolf, why’d you disturb my meditation?” I fumed trying to
settle back into the bed I’d made out of my cloak.</p>
<p>“Your sleep you mean, you lazy oaf”, Jobner’s growl came back. “That’s
no normal wolf”. He pulled the cloak off me. Knowing that he would not let me
sleep…um… meditate until we had brought down what ever it was, I sighed and
got to my feet.</p>
<p>I began the chant of sight, wincing when sharp jolt hit my eyes. I did a
double take when I saw what circled my fire. A huge wolf stalked back and forth
eyes never leaving mine. It was half again as big as Jobner, with eyes that
glowed with their own fire.</p>
<p>I slowly lowered my self, picking up my spear, eyes never leaving the wolf.
As if deciding I was finally a challenge worth its while, it waited until I
stood before striking.</p>
<p>“Spirits protect me” I chanted as the beast charged. The spell caught
just as the wolf would have hit. Its eyes widened a bit as it started to circle
again. Now looking for an easy opening. Its eyes finally left mine and started
following the tip of my spear.</p>
<p>I feinted to the left and kicked the beast hard in the belly and was rewarded
with a yelp.</p>
<p>“That’s hardly fair now is it” was Jobner’s comment. “ He was
watching the battle with mild disinterest. “Your feet really should be wider
apart” he commented critiquing my fighting style.</p>
<p>“What?” I looked back, the dire wolf leapt and carried me to the ground.</p>
<p>“Pay attention to what you’re doing”, came Jobner’s reply.</p>
<p>I grabbed as much of the dire wolves neck as I could with one hand, and
proceeded to punch its face repeatedly. “Y’know some help would be nice”</p>
<p>“What do you think I’m doing?” came the sniff of my spirit companion.
“Ohh… I see what you mean”. Jobner got lazily to his feet and stretched.
He watched the two of us tussle on the ground waiting patiently for his turn.</p>
<p>Sighing, sounding very put upon, he casually walked up to the wolf, who was
happily trying to gnaw through my neck guard, and bit it on the hind quarters.</p>
<p>I could see the beasts eyes go wide a second before he let go of my neck. I
got shakily to my feet as Jobner kept the beast busy.</p>
<p>Calling upon frost and plague, the beast grew ill while Jobner continued to
worry it. Finally it began to skulk off, limping, when my spear ended its
misery.</p>
<p>Jobner, looked over disdainfully, and settled next to the fire. “Your watch”,
he growled and went to sleep before I could protest.</p>
<p>I looked up at the sky wondering what I had done to deserve this trial. The
fire danced, as the hours slipped by, and much to my chagrin, nothing gave me
cause to awake my irksome companion.</p>
<p>Dawn, found me covered with a light coating of snow, glaring more at my
canine companion then keeping a proper watch. Shortly after the sun rose, Jobner
awoke, shook himself out and smacking his lips asked “Whats for breakfast?”</p>
<p>I managed to hit him square between the eyes with a dried fish. “Fish’ I
growled.</p>
<p>“You’re aim is improving” he sniggered making that fish and several
others disappear quickly.</p>
<p>I packed sullenly hoping to reach the dwarven city soon. A few beers, or
maybe some whisky would do wonders right now. Aside from which we were running
low on provisions and I hate spirit bread.</p>
<p>We started to make good time, across the snowy hills. I began to notice
Jobner stopping and looking around periodically. He never stopped long and my
mood prevented me from asking him what it was.</p>
<p>It had been going on for a while when I became aware of something as well. A
slow beating sound, like that of a large drum or perhaps gnomish machinery. I
realized that I had been hearing it for a while as we walked but it had only
recently grown loud enough to penetrate my thick skull.</p>
<p>The snow began to pickup, reducing visibility greatly and preventing me from
determining the source of the sound.</p>
<p>We managed to avoid several more of the snow cats, barely. Thankfully, they
seemed to have as much trouble seeing in this snow as I did. After forcing our
way through the snow for what seemed like hours… days? Jobner stopped, and
started to growl.</p>
<p>I was a little shaken by this. Nothing I had yet seen managed to get through
my companions indifference. Unslinging my shield and spear I started to chant.</p>
<p>The swirling snow broke for a moment o so revealing a huge dark shape before
us. It didn’t seem to move, and at first I thought it might be a building or
Tree.</p>
<p>We continued to move closer to it just to try to make out what it was.</p>
<p>BAH-DUMP.</p>
<p>The sound returned louder then before, and coming from the structure? ahead
of us. There was now no doubt in my mind that the sound was not a drum but was
instead a loud heartbeat.</p>
<p>The snow cleared again revealing the scariest damn building, if it was a
building, I had ever seen.</p>
<p>Take a bucket, fill it with evil and turn It over on the snow, and you might
get an idea what this thing looked like. Only the bucket would need to be bigger
then the trees of Faydark.</p>
<p>A sickly blue light emanated from it and its black surface was hard to look
upon. Spikes ran out of it in all directions with no pattern or purpose, spikes
that could hold the whole of Halas upon them with room to spare.</p>
<p>“I be thinking that’s not a place likely to serve beer…” I said more
to myself then to Jobner. Backing away slowly I noticed movement along the
bottom. At first I thought them mere snow dervishes, like you get on any windy
day. After a few moments of observation I realized that they moved with a
purpose, in a patrolling fashion.</p>
<p>Jobner kept pace with my slow retreat, the snow began to pickup again and
soon the tower was out of sight. The heartbeat continued for quite some time as
I began to circle as best as I could where the towers were.</p>
<p>We managed to avoid several of the snow dervish creatures as well. Seeing
them closer allowed me to discern several bones spinning amidst their snowy
bodies.</p>
<p>It wasn’t very long after that that we came across a series of large ice
flows connecting this island to the next. A large dark shape on one of them was
revealed as a large sea turtle as we approached.</p>
<p>“I be thinking turtle soup would be a welcome meal on a day such as this”
I commented, Jobner had been quiet since the tower, only pausing to bemoan my
inadequacies as a shaman once or twice, each time without much heart.</p>
<p>Jobner looked at the turtle, then looked at me as if sizing the two of us up.
He shook his head. “I don’t think yer up to it” he growled snickering.</p>
<p>“Always the optimist”. I grumbled. Drawing my spear and my shield, I
called down on the spirits to grip my dinner er opponent, so that I make this a
quick battle.</p>
<p>The chant completed, to my great surprise and Jobner’s amusement, the
turtle was not pinned in place as he should have been. As a matter of fact, as
the spell completed the turtle locked eyes with me and shot forward, knocking me
flat on my hairy ass.</p>
<p>I screamed as the beast latched onto my shield arm and broke it cleanly in
half. I chanted attack after attack, the turtle wasn’t phased by any of them.
A clean smack to the head of the thing got it to release my arm, which now hung,
useless at my side.</p>
<p>Jobner was managing to nip the creatures legs and tail, but was having little
if any effect. Deciding that spirit bread wasn’t so bad after all, I began to
chant the tale of the wolf and started running. The damn turtle, followed,
nearly as fast as I was. It had no interest in Jobner, who nipped at his heels,
merely on me.</p>
<p>We ran like that for about 3 hours, over the hills and snow of the island,
passing any number of started gnomes, finally the snow picked up again dropping
visibility to nothing, and I paused for a few minutes, my back to a snowdrift
taller then I.</p>
<p>I called on the spirits for healing, mending my arm as best I could. Jobner
arrived shortly afterwards, and critiqued my crude healing attempt.</p>
<p>“Where is it”, I demanded, a trying to keep the worry out of my voice.</p>
<p>“Lost in the snow like we are o mighty one” His growl was the tone of an
indulgent elder.</p>
<p>“Mighty Corudoth does not like turtle soup” came a chuckling voice.</p>
<p>I jumped to my feet, yelping as I put weight on my still healing arm. Before
us stood the oldest gnoll I had ever seen-his entire body was covered with white
fur.. Now for those of you who don’t know, the True Race spent every chance it
got warring with the gnolls of black burrow. After the second or third millennia
of this, it started to fade as a racial hatred, not that either side would admit
it, and became more along the lines of a sporting event. Sure warriors on both
sides still died, but it’s a sign of a good competition to have a death or
three occur, and at this point we have a greater fatality rate in our swimming
competitions then our yearly battles with the gnolls. Our young warriors and
theirs get their first taste of battle with each other, and the occasional death
keeps it interesting. As a matter of fact, last battle I fought in, I won about
20 plat off a gnoll betting on the outcome of the battle.</p>
