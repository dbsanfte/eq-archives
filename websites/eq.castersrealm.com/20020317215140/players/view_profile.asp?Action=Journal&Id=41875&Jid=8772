<p></p>
<p>Seems I've gotten used to the desert.  I spent a great deal of time there, dodging sand giants and spectres, and slaying members of the massive orc army unlucky enough to stray too close.  My prowess has improved dramatically, and in recent weeks I have been granted access to more of Brell's infinite power.  Since my fighting effectiveness has improved, I've been more successful in combat, and have come away with more loot from the fallen enemies.  Generally, as before, I still give much of what I find to younger followers of Good I see in the deserts near Freeport.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was during one of my runs between the Oasis and Freeport that I met Fyrviel Fyrestorme, an elven ranger from my homeland of Faydwer.  Indeed, she told me she was a representative of the High Council of Faydwer, a guild of adventurers like myself who all hail from that continent.  She said that the Council had heard about some of my deeds, and thought that I would fit well within their ranks.  I had heard of the Council, and had even see them on occasion during my days fighting Runnyeyes in Kaladim.  It seemed to me that this guild followed many of the same ethics and ideals as I, and felt that I could only benefit from being one of their number.  I told Fyrviel that I would be glad to join, if the Council would have me.  We agreed, and now with the Miner's Guild 249, the Clerics of Underfoot, and a citizen of Kaladim, I also bear the mantle of the High Council of Faydwer.  A decision that I have not regretted once unto this day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recently, I had been largely unsuccessful in finding groups to battle the Oasis orcs with.  Not only that, but the orc's tactics were becoming old and stale, and I wasn't feeling like I can learn much more from fighting them.  So I instead took to hunting alone, which was risky to say the least.  I had seen many fellow adventurers fighting the local crocodiles that seem common on the beaches of Oasis, so I thought I'd try my hand on them.  I also found that fighting the Dry Bones skeletons and ghouls roaming the dunes was challenging as well, which is good; if I can find a good balance between risk and reward, my skills can grow the fastest.  I think this idea is working out well for me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One day while fighting in the dunes, I heard a familiar voice call out to me, and to my surprise, I saw Ravenflight standing not too far away!  We met up, and thought it would be fun to go ahead and do some hunting together.  So, for the rest of the day and most of the night, we ran along the shores, looking for crocs to fight.  Suddenly, we were beset by an orc warrior, who began to strike me from behind.  At this point I was forced to defend meself both from the orc, and a deepwater crocodile I was fighting before the cowardly orc assaulted me.  I held the orc back as best I could, while concentrating the brunt of my attacks on the crocodile... while it was difficult to ignore the orcs' vicious slashing with his weapon, the croc could swallow me whole in one swift chomp.  After slaying the beast, I spun on my heel and poured everything I had into defeating the honorless orc warrior.  I had taken many hits, and was pretty sure at this point that I was nearing my limit.  But Brell was over me as he always is, and once the orc realized he was overmatched he turned and ran, yellow as the shirt he wore.  I struck him down before he could take three steps, and emerged victorious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the fight, it suddenly hit me that Ravenflight hadn't gotten involved in the fight at all once the orc joined in.  Confused and angry, I confronted him on the matter, since I was sure he was more than a match for the orc.  He smiled broadly, and said that he wanted to see for himself just how strong of a warrior I really was.  Before I could loudly and possibly physically protest such an idea, he went on to say that he had full faith in me, since I had full faith in Brell... he wanted to see if the strength in my soul matched the strength in my arms.  I'm sure this is some weird human thing, but after he explained this to me, I felt my anger subside... besides, I won the battle, after all.  We sat, and recovered from the day's events.  Ravenflight explained to me that he had been with me through many battles, and thought that I had proven my worth as a man and a warrior.  He said that rather than simply indroducing myself by my first name to those I meet, I should start telling them my surname as well, so that when the songs and stories are written about the heroes of the land, my family will be able to boast of having one of those heroes in their line.  I'm not sure if anything I do will be recorded in the tomes of history, but what he said was true... part of what I do, I do to bring to honor to my clan and family.  I took what he said to heart, and have began indroducing myself as Kullom Faithforge of Kaladim.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One more thing of note, and I'm surprised I did not mention it earlier.  A few days ago, while resting in between fighting crocs, Ravenflight and I heard a shout from over a nearby hill that the giant crocodile known as Lockjaw had emerged from the depths!  Ravenflight and I rushed to the site, and found the creature already in combat with a lone elf warrior.  We jumped into the fray, and attacked.  Ravenflight blasted away at the beast with spells of frost, while I called on the power of Brell to help protect and strengthen myself during the fight.  Lockjaw fought back viciously, his huge maw threatening to close over any one of us at any moment.  Ravenflight took the worst of it, and it suddenly occured to me that he was close to falling before our adversary.  I called on Brell to empower my hands with healing energy, but alas, it was too late, and Ravenflight tumbled to the ground.  Enraged, I chopped at Lockjaw with mighty cleaves from my Axe, which must have intimidated the giant, for soon, he started running back toward the sea!  I wasn't about to let him go, however, and after a mighty blow across the back, Lockjaw slumped to the ground.  After ensuring the creature was finished, I walked over to Ravenflight, and was relieved to find him alive and retrieving his fallen equipment.  We went back over to where Lockjaw lay, and talked about how tough his hide was.  We thought we might be able to fashion some crude armor from it, some that might be able to protect as well as my ringmail!  We carved out a piece, and over the camp that night, made a piece of Lockjaw Hide armor.  Raven let me have it, since I had defeated the beast.  After that we just drank ourselves to sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tomorrow I head to High Keep with Ravenflight, he says the training there is very good.  I'm looking forward to it.</p>
