</FONT><HR>Reposted from eq.stratics.com.  Got my blood boiling, anyway.  Sometimes EQ seems like an elaborate mechanism designed to prove the theory that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It apparently leads to thinner skin as well.<P>---------------------------------------<P>Vallon Zek (PvP-Teams) Server News [ 9:59 PM PST ] - Alethal<P>Recently logging on to this server you will have noticed a Message of the Day saying it is now a bannable offense to kill a GM while they are linkdead. The day before this message one was slain and the player was banned, those who assisted were suspended for three days. However this rule was not in place at the time. I have recieved many comments about this issue. I ask that you all please use the message boards here and at EverQuest To post your comments. Also please contact Gordon and Brad on this. I can not post many of the comments I have recieved due to the content but here goes:<P><BR>As much as i love EQ i hate how Verant represents their GMs as GODs and when one of them dies they call it abuse and ban a person. not once have i read anywhere that killing a GM is an abuse. there was NO SUCH RULE.they made it after a guide was killed and banned our people for that. it is so damn rediculous to make a rule and aply it to a situation that happened prior to that rule even existing. it may be "cheesy" killing a link dead guide but till now NO WHERE has it been stated that it was banable offence. hell, when i was talking to that guide i was talking in character to which she responded the same. if a high elf character is in dark team lands they still should fear us. when they role play hating trolls, ogres, and dark elves they should expect to be attacked. i was talking to this guide "wenna" about her errogance of being in lavastorm surrounded by dark elves to whish she laughed in my face. the point is that, that particular guide chose to role play therefore opening herself to our attacks. i dont care if they say guides are not interested in attacking other people, because that is a total BS. they do attack and kill players, only they call it "a GM event", thus justifying it. when it is convinient for them to kill other players they do so and have a justification, when they get killed (and lose nothing btw) they lose their status as GODs and their pride is hurt. then they ban those players involved saying it was an offence. again, how can you aply a rule to a situation that happened prior to such rule existing? i dont care if you post this on eq.stratics or not, if you do it should be in a cleaner format btw, but i want verant to get this message and reply to it. btw, we asked GMs if it was a bannable offence to kill a linkdead person, to which they responded "no". so how is it that killing a linkdead GM any different? if GMs are there to help people and NOT interract with them, then they should be invisible at all times when they are not interracting with them, rather then roleplaying (or at leasts that waht i thought) a character who hated trolls, ogres, and dark elves alike. in the future, you must post a list of rules before something happeneds so people know that it is "wrong" to do such and such. how the hell did we know it was "wrong" to kill a guide? tell me that please? here is the quote from lead GM of vallon zek and please specify where does he say it is wrong to kill a gm? was there a rule before that EVERYONE saw and was made clear it is wrong to attack a GM? i dont think so.<BR>"...You are being suspended for guide abuse by killing a guidewhile link dead. I am very sorry I must do things like this but you all knew you were doing something wrong..."<P>i am very pissed at verant's unclear policy here. if you do not state what it is wrong or right before something happens, you cant ban our players later saying they supposetly knew it was wrong. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=If++Verant+could+just+stop+shooting+(slashing|QUS|++piercing|QUS|)++themselves+in+the+foot+:(">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>First of all GMs and guides are, if not gods, at least supposed to be the in game tech support/customer service.  Imagine going into a shopping center and killing the person at the information desk.  If anyone is shooting themselves in the foot it would be the cowards who took the guide down while he was l/d.  Banning might have been harsh in your perspective but it certainly sends the message:  "Don't mess with the Guides."  Also doesn't endear the PvP servers to Verant in any way, shape, or form.<P>What did these people hope to gain from all this anyhow, the Guide's ring of invincibility?  Really, what they were thinking...  "Hey, he's linkdead.  Let's kill him."  Even as a joke it just comes across as really, really stupid.<P>~Hanlayen of Karana, Idle Enchanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=If++Verant+could+just+stop+shooting+(slashing|QUS|++piercing|QUS|)++themselves+in+the+foot+:(">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well it was more than likely done as a joke...<P>I know if I came across a guide that was LD I might snicker and take a few shots...don't know that I'd kill em but can't say I have a problem with it.<P>Even if they were misguided enough to actually think they could loot the guide I don't see the problem.  Heck, If the body could be looted I might think twice about capping a guide or GM.<P>But if they actually banned someone prior to putting the rule in place then it is abusive and innapropriate.  I cannot understand how this possibly was more than a minor inconvenience to the guide or GM in question so my mind boggles at the harshness of the penalty.<P>As to the realism factor, Verant destroyed any and all semblance of realism (as well as any suspension of disbelief) when they continued to propagate the whole camping method for aquiring needed (and oft times required) items.<P>If this is legitimate and there are no extenuating circumstance involved (aside from killing the LD guide/GM) then this is a hideous abuse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=If++Verant+could+just+stop+shooting+(slashing|QUS|++piercing|QUS|)++themselves+in+the+foot+:(">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>That does get my blood boiling too. In any context, virtual or not I hate to see laws enforced retro-activly. It seems that despite the fact that we are paying customers we have no rights. Guess I should have read the fine print in that "I accept" message more carfully. Whether or not anyone is "in our world now" everyone deserves to be considered innocent until proven guilty and should be told what the law is before they are held to it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=If++Verant+could+just+stop+shooting+(slashing|QUS|++piercing|QUS|)++themselves+in+the+foot+:(">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I really dont see what you are upset about killing a LD guide while being stupid could also be considered harassment of CS staff as doing so prevents them from doing thier jobs.Just because something is not spelled out to you does not mean that there was no rule in place for it.Obviously there is no way to put in writing every possible thing you cannot do so how about using a little common sense?There is absolutely no reason to kill a CS staff member other then do be a disruption so why do it?<P>I just do not get people sometimes<P><BR>Tsorath Ravenspirit</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=If++Verant+could+just+stop+shooting+(slashing|QUS|++piercing|QUS|)++themselves+in+the+foot+:(">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I think that any company who cannot figure out how to make their own players invincible, is just plain lame.<BR> <BR>So what if they got killed, while LD or not. Has nobody else here gone LD only to find themselves naked and waiting in front of the gate when the reconnected? And <B><I>we</I></B> had to go cross 2 zones, wait for the boat, cross 2 more zones, go where we last knew we were, only to find out that we wandered off while we were disconnected, and spend the next half hour shouting for help in trying to retrieve it. And that's on a NON pvp server. I can imagine it's worse when you may have to worry about being killed while naked by a PC too.<BR> <BR>All the guide had to do was jump to the zone and summon his corpse. Bummer.<BR> <BR>Yes, they have a job to do, and we're paying them to do it, so hows-about everybody just lightening up a bit on both sides. It's just a game.

</FONT><HR>Verant can, and has, enforced any rule they've wanted whether it existed previously or not. They also choose NOT to enforce their rules when it suits them.<P>It is, unfortunately, one of the hazards of playing this game. From seeing others suspended for being victimized (however temporarily) and sometimes worse, I have low personal opinions of Verant's collective idea of customer support. In general, the attitude seems 'guilty until proven innocent', and of late, 'You were guilty of breaking this rule, even if we never told you it WAS a rule, shame on you.' There is no recourse, generally. There is little, if any, way to defend yourself or your actions if they decide you've crossed any one of a number of lines.<P>The moral of these stories is(IMO): Be ready for it, take it in stride, and try to enjoy the game anyway. Because there's nothing else YOU can do, except leave or be miserable.<P>------------------<BR>Fraethir Twiceborn<BR>Enchanter, Lords of Light<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=If++Verant+could+just+stop+shooting+(slashing|QUS|++piercing|QUS|)++themselves+in+the+foot+:(">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Despite the effects on the said GM or guild, I have to commend the players of EQ for the ingenuity and willingness to try all possibilities.  After all if you saw a store clerk walking around with a m16 (that's face it that's in affect what a GM has) and all you had was a spork but you found a way to kill him none the less… you've got a adventurers spirit.  <P>Seriously I do not see where Verant thinks this in any way helps the game and their business. For two minutes of inconvenience of there Tech they lost $10 a month probably more because they have discouraged other player to even playing.<P>Just a thought,<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=If++Verant+could+just+stop+shooting+(slashing|QUS|++piercing|QUS|)++themselves+in+the+foot+:(">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>hehe I say more power to them.  After all the times I've heard GMs tell me that they can't help me I would have liked to be involved too. We could get huge groups of 50th levelers together for a bit of GM bashing.  So what if they would be too busy staying alive to tell you that they could not help you. It would give the 50th player somthing fun to do and the lower level players somthing to look forward too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=If++Verant+could+just+stop+shooting+(slashing|QUS|++piercing|QUS|)++themselves+in+the+foot+:(">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>ROFLMAO<P>That is the single funniest EQ event I have ever heard of.  <P>puff, puff, I can't breathe.<P>OMG!  What an awesome event, to kill a GM, LD or no.  hahahahhaha.<P>And the cowards banned a really smart and creative player.  Hey, I wouldn't have thought of it.  I'm soooo impressed.<P>Don't loot the ring of invulnerability, it doesn't seem to work.  hehe.<P>Who the f cares if they knock off a GM.  They were linkdead anyway, no skin off their nose.  When linkdead, can't help anyone anyway.<P>I think it would be cool for players to hunt GM's as a regular thing.  I mean if they allow GM's to be killed (by not making them immortal) then hey, hunt fest 2000.  <P>Well, I'm truly sorry that people were punished for great playing.  I hope that someday another GM event occurs.  Sounds like good fun.<P>Note:  If Verant doesn't want the GM's killable, then they should make it impossible to kill them, not punish the players for quick thinking.<P>*guffaw*  Thanks for uplifting my day.<P> <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><BR><P>------------------<BR>Shayd<BR>Pray the God of Nerf never finds you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=If++Verant+could+just+stop+shooting+(slashing|QUS|++piercing|QUS|)++themselves+in+the+foot+:(">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000025&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000025&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
