Ch 19 The Ring of Scale<br>
---------------------- </p>

<p>The storms above the jungle continent were violent today, even
more so then normal. The inhabitants of the fort of Fironia Vie
were terrified of the storm. The winds howled and raged against
the newly completed encampment. The inhabitants did their best to
shelter themselves as the dark clouds above boomed and rumbled
high above them. Then there was panic as lightning began to fall
from the heavens. First there were the great flashes of light
illuminating the fort, then that eerie calm just before the
deafening crack of thunder. This pattern of terror continued for
almost an hour and then there was another great flash of light
and an explosion. Lightning had struck on of the fort walls
shattering them. </p>

<p>&quot;Come on! We got to patch the hole before something gets
in!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Alright go get some help from the other shelter!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;OK!&quot; </p>

<p>The middle aged High elf dashed towards on of the battered
shelters and rapped loudly upon the door all the while the wind
and rain beat upon him. </p>

<p>&quot;Open up! We need help out here! One of the walls has
been hit! We need to fix it before something gets inside!&quot; </p>

<p>The door opens slightly. </p>

<p>&quot;Alright. We'll meet you there; I'll get the supplies.
Check to see if any one was hurt!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;OK! Hurry!&quot; </p>

<p>The door slammed shut, and the elf was left out alone in the
rain again. Swearing to himself for getting stationed here, he
then runs of to inspect the damage. After a few moments he rounds
one of the huts and gets a look at the devastation. </p>

<p>&quot;By Tunare! And we just got this blasted thing
finished!&quot; The lightning had detonated the wall apart and a
majority of it was now engulfed in flames. </p>

<p>&quot;Micas! Micas!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hurry over! We got a live one over here!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Where!?!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Inside the wall, he's encircled by the fire!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Can you get him?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah! But it looks like he's hurt. We need a cleric
fast!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ok! I get my stuff ready you go get him!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Right!&quot; </p>

<p>The other, a wood elf recited a quick spell and he levitated
off the ground. He then dashed above the flames to reach the
wounded man. It was a young Erudite. He was unconscious but he
didn't seem to have any apparent injuries. He floated gently to
the ground and scooped up the Erudite &quot;Ummph. You're a heavy
fellow aren't you?&quot; Then hovered out. Part of the wall
collapsing behind him.<br>
----------------------------- </p>

<p>Arorua.....for you.....Veeshan
will...pay...Everyone......Leylia..will
be...safe...like...promised....maybe..she..can be...happy... </p>

<p><br>
&quot;He's kinda cute for an Erudite. Don't you think?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe but He's so big! And tall too!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;!!!! You didn't! Ahh no fair!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Girls! Quiet! Our young friend must rest. He is quiet
fortunate that he was only knocked unconscious by the storm. But
that is no reason to chatter on like a pair of hens!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hens! You old bag of saw dust!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now, Now lets not start with name-calling. Just let our
guest get some sleep.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Humph. Alright lets go.&quot; </p>

<p>The two elf girls exit the room and close the door. </p>

<p>&quot;Little Harpies...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I heard that Gramps!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;An interesting way of rearing young.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You should be one to talk my friend. A young fellow like
yourself shouldn't be out so far from Odus.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I am more then capable of taking care of myself.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Really? Then why did two of our people have to save you
from fiery death?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was resting. It has been a long journey.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure it has. We don't get many visitors from Paineel
around these parts.&quot; </p>

<p>That got the Erudite's attention; he sat up in the bed and
tensed slightly ready to spring. </p>

<p>&quot;Calm yourself lad. I may not like your kind or the deity
that you follow, but I can sense a something from you. Something
that could vary well change, the face of Norrath. For you see, I
know why you are here lad.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Really? And what is that?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Your heart is full of hate, but not the kind that the
lord of shadows instills upon his followers, but the kind caused
by a great loss. Yes lad, you have come here to seek
vengeance.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You see well for a blind man.&quot; </p>

<p>The old elf smiles. &quot;It seems you too have a keen sense
of sight as well. You and one other are the only ones that know
of 'ailment'&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My trade requires it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, the way of the shadows and the crimson hell fires
of Fear itself.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You are correct again.&quot; Raziel gets out of the bed,
he fades slightly and his armor forms around him. &quot;But I
have little time left. Since you seem to be a wealth of
information, maybe you can impart me with a few things.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And what knowledge do you seek?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How do I reach The Ring of Scale?&quot; </p>

<p>The elf smiles even greater. &quot;I was right about you. You
do have a large destiny in front of you. To reach the Ring of
Scale, you must ascend the highest mountain of Sky Fire. But you
can not scale it like some spelunker you must ascend from inside
the mountain knows as Veeshan's Peak.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How do I enter the mountain?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It is sealed by a door and to open it you must take the
key from the gatekeeper.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;..Let me guess you're the gatekeeper?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;As I said before your sense of sight is quite
exceptional. Yes lad, I am the host of the Gatekeeper to
Veeshan's Peak. I have lived since before time itself existed.
Living with the gods and goddesses was my greatest pleasure and
now look at me bound to a weakened mortal form, because I dared
to speak up for the mortals that I loved. There are time I almost
regret challenging Veeshan, but then I think of what greatness
you have accomplished and what you can, no that the seeds of
power have been laid.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There is so much that has been pulled over you mortals
head's. If only you knew. But as you said young one, there is not
much time and especially not for a story that spans infinities.
Here take this&quot; </p>

<p>The old elf reaches into his shirt and removes a necklace and
on the necklace is a small crystal claw. </p>

<p>&quot;Now go. Play out your destiny.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe in destiny old man. I make my
fate.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe. You my not believe in fate lad, but fate
certainly believes in you.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel stares at the old man for a moment, and then disappears
into the shadows.<br>
------------------------- </p>

<p>The small crystal claw fit perfectly into the slot and the
door rumbled for a bit then it gently rolls away. Revealing a
large dark opening. Raziel's eyes shimmered briefly and the cave
became illuminated to him. What was once a cave was now a small
shrine, adorned with art and sculptures. The walls were painted
with pictographs of various points in history. Some were easily
recognizable. Like the destruction of the Combine Empire but
others were new. One showed winged figures flying madly though
the air; some adorned in battle armor and flaming swords. Others
were in various states of procreation. Another wall was covered
in strange objects, almost similar to gnomish clockworks,
drifting through the air. But he didn't study the pictographs
long; he continued through the shrine and came upon what looked
like an altar. On top of the altar was a small platinum globe. </p>

<p>Raziel places the claw onto of the globe and then twists it.
There is a loud clank and the altar begins to rise rapidly. It
continues to soar high into the mountain for several minutes and
then a bright flash of light blinds him. He squints for a moment
and calls of the enchantment he placed on himself, and everything
fades to normal. </p>

<p>Raziel steps off the altar platform and into a new room. This
room is filled with luscious plants and vegetation. A waterfall
can be heard in the distance. Then a new sound starts to approach
him. It is the beating of wings. But very small ones. It is
coming from behind him. </p>

<p>Raziel turns around and finds himself facing what appears to
be a winged pink flying housecat. The flying cat hovers and
stares at him for all the while purring gently. </p>

<p>&quot;What do you what fuzzy?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;FUZZY! Humph! Of all the nerve. Come all this way just
to insult me!&quot; The cat glows slightly and then changes form
into a naked dark elf woman. &quot;Hmmph. You have just lost
favor with me. I hope your good a licking boots if you expect
anything out of me.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Silverwing, you shouldn't be so hostile to our guests,
I'm sure he didn't mean anything by it. And it's not like we get
that many guests up here anyway. So we can allow him a few
mistakes of Etiquette.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But he called me Fuzzy!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;In your other form you rather scraggly, Fuzzy&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'll get you for that Phara!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'd like to see you try.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel turns to the other voice, who is perched a reasonable
distance away. The one called Phara was a Half elf; he was
leaning back chewing on something. Three other flying cats
appeared out of the distance and sat down beside Phara. </p>

<p>Phara sat up and turned to Raziel. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, mortal you've come all this way and obviously
gotten the favor of the gatekeeper. What brings you to us?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I seek entrance to Veeshan's realm. The Plane of
Sky!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And why do you seek it?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My own business&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I can't just let you mortals go willy nilly around
Veeshan's realm now can we? So tell me, why do you seek
entrance?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Vengeance.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Of what.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My wife, was taken by one who follows Veeshan. I have
come for their heads.&quot; </p>

<p>The five laugh. &quot;And what mortal can best a chosen of
Veeshan?&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel holds out his hand and the Kirosawa materializes in it.
The demon-blade pulses black, then ignites into dark flames. </p>

<p>&quot;I can.&quot; </p>

<p>The five members of the Ring of Scale stop laughing at the
site of the Demon-Blade. They know what it takes to wield it and
the price for doing so. </p>

<p>&quot;Alright, your request shall be granted. But know this,
by stepping through the Azure gate, you will forfeit your life to
Veeshan's will.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Silverwing, Druushk, Hoshkar, Xygoz. Are you
ready?&quot; </p>

<p>The four announce their readiness and they all began to glow
slightly. And all five loses their present forms and slowly began
tower over Raziel. They begin to grow scales and claws, their
bodies begin to elongate and contort. And in a few brief moments,
their true forms are revealed. The five members of the Ring of
Scale, the High Dragons. </p>

<p>Phara begins to speak again, his voice now hugely amplified.
&quot;Now mortal, you shall go to Veeshan's realm.&quot; </p>

<p><br>
They all begin to glow again and in a short moment a large Azure
gate appears in front of Raziel. Raziel looks through the gate,
noting how clear it is and how peaceful it looks. But soon those
thoughts fade from his mind and his anger sets back in, he passes
through the gate.<br>
------------------------- </p>

<p>First nothingness. Then a cool breeze blows across him. He is
standing on a small island floating amongst the clouds. He looks
across the land and looks for his final destination. But he is
interrupted as a flash of light leaps into the air from a
distance and begins to come toward him. The light quickly cuts
across the sky and stops in front of him. The light slowly fades
away leaving a winged female figure floating in front of him. </p>

<p>&quot;Mortals are not welcome amongst Veeshan's realm. Leave
now or prepare to die.&quot; </p>

<p>Raziel is shocked for a moment and he drops his sword.
&quot;No..It can't be....<br>
---------------------------<br>

<p>After all this time and after all the hardships suffered,
Raziel has finally made it to Veeshan's realm The Plane of Sky.
Now he can have his vengeance for the life of Arorua and answer
the questions that have been burning in his heart since this
start. The next chapter will decide the fate of not only him but
Norrath as well. It is undeniably the final chapter of The Shadow
Falls!<br>
