     The night air was clear, with a fresh scent of rain drifting in from the Karana’s as Jolmon walked his rounds with quiet ease, thinking of a girl who he had shared the night with the day before. Of her soft skin, and gentle touch. How such things could blind a man’s mind, and how such things, gets a man killed. Yet, Qeynos was quiet as it had been for the past months.<p>
     Only a few outbreaks of Gnoll attacks had caused any problems around his post, the Hills of Qeynos. Very rarely did anything of danger pass through these hills. Jolmon figured it was due to the fact that there was very little past them. Save the lands of Erud, which for the most part, were off limits to most. Jolmon had visited the high man’s city of Erudin once in his life, a odd city to his mind. He remembered teleports everywhere, gates leading to areas he could only imagine.  His squad had been taken to the city to learn various magical signs. And most importantly, how to resist it’s lure. At the time, he had thought nothing of it and found it actually quiet useless. Yet his commander insisted they all learn it as he gave accounts on how it had saved his own life more than once. The commander had also promised them a small pay raise and a night with the “bottle”.<p>
     Jolmon grinned at the memory. That night was a crazy night, and if he had remembered correctly, the Lion’s Inn had run out of ale and mead. Thumbing the hilt of his sword at his waist he continued down a trodden path. Visions of off duty drinking spurred into his mind. The sooner he finished his patrol, the sooner he could be next to the lass and bottle.<p> 
     Taking in another breath of the sweet Karana air, he smiled. How lucky he was to serve an army which treated it’s men well. Though, perhaps it was himself who treated himself well. That was it, the army just provided him with the money, and he provided himself with all the joys of the soldiers life. Jolmon stopped a moment, and gazed over the landscape, finding the main entrance to the accursed place of the Gnolls.<p> 
     Many times had Jolmon thought how easy it would be to take on their “hide out”. Yet, the attempts which had been made, had all failed. Every time he had been awed by their defenses, and how they could turn away an army of their size and power. Even alongside a few barbarians. The thought still baffled him, though perhaps not much longer.<p> 
     About fifty yards away, he spotted a lone gnoll. A simple and most likely harmless target, but a target none the less he needed to defeat. He started to trot towards the gnoll, as he closed the distance, he withdrew his long sword. Within twenty yards, he clanked his sword on his shield, to catch it’s attention. An attention, which was not caught. Shouting this time, he ran up closer. Again, the gnoll did not turn or pay heed to the cries of warning.<p> 
     Within a few feet, Jolmon held his blade next to his shield, ready to strike. Immediately he halted. His eyes grew and his jaw slackened. The gnoll looked –– possessed –– that was the only way he could put it. Dark green eyes, glazed over, the thing’s face was slack and free of any emotion. It was just –– moving. It reminded him of tales of the undead, how they just wandered ––for some unknown purpose. Was this an undead gnoll?<p> 
     Turning just a little, without letting his sword or shield drop he surveyed the surrounding area. Perhaps other guards were out and would be able to aid him, or at least explain to him what he was seeing. Looking the gnoll over once again, he figured it safe to put down his defenses. Obviously, the thing was paying him no attention, and thus no harm.<p> 
     As he lowered his shield, the gnoll kept on moving. As he sheathed his sword, it kept on moving forward. Eyes glazed and fogged. Motions moving just enough to keep it’s pace. Jolmon stopped following and just stood there watching it move forward. The guard scratched his forehead, just below his helm. Letting out a slow breath, he decided it best if he struck the thing down now, and save the punishment later from his commander if the beast decided to do any harm. The thought of it doing such a thing, boggled his mind. How could such a gnoll do such a thing? Gnoll’s were kind creatures.<p> 
     His mind flooded with thoughts. Thought’s he knew he should not have. Suddenly he gasped. Magic. He was being beguiled by something or someone. Quickly, he thought back to his magic training. 'Resist thoughts instilled by an unknown force’ they had said, well this force was unknown enough to him. Jolmon drew his sword, and gave a loud cry and chased after the gnoll who was now twenty yards away.<p> 
     With a quick arc of his blade, it bit into the gnoll’s shoulder. Blood sprayed his chain armor, and the gash would have been felt by any, yet it kept on moving forward. Puzzled, he pulled his blade back, and thrust it deep into the gut of the creature. A stream of blood poured out staining the gnoll’s tunic, but not slowing him one pace.<p> 
     Jolmon took a step in front of the creature, and looked into it’s eyes. Removing a army issued dagger from his side belt, he thrust it into the right eye of the gnoll. Once again, no slowing. The guard looked at the mess of a gnoll, it’s fur a tangled red mess, gashes of blood continued to slip out. Jolmon’s arms went slack, just about giving up.<p> 
     Keeping pace alongside the gnoll, he looked into the other eye. It was still glazed and foggy. Situating himself for another strike at the gnoll, he was about to thrust when the remaining eye blinked. Jolmon halted. The fogginess was no longer there –– nor the glazed look. The eye had no problem finding Jolmon, standing shocked in front of it. From the once motionless arms, the non severed arm grabbed Jolmon by the throat, and held.<p> 
     The guard struggled, and realized he had misjudged the size of the thing. It stood a good two feet taller than he. The whole time the creature had been slumping in it’s slacked state. Cold, rough hands held tightly around his neck. One hand encompassing the girth of his neck and the squeeze only made it easier. Jolmon dropped shield and sword and lifted his hands up to try and remove the thick hand around this throat.<p> 
     Gurgling sounds escaped his mouth, as he tried to gasp for air. Oh, how we wished he could take another gasp of Karana’s air. Such sweet air. Peering through teary eyes, he saw the gnoll move it’s other arm up to it’s other eye. Jolmon scolded himself for not killing the thing now, and not cutting off both arms. The gnoll retracted a small dagger from its eye, and peered at it. Jolmon saw the snarl curl upon those purple lips as it plunged the dagger into his victim’s forehead.<p> 
     Jolmon felt a cold stab, no pain. His sight began to fade, when he realized that he had been tossed aside, onto the cool grass. Jolmon took a gasp, breathing in the sweet air. Such sweet air, tonight he would lie with the lass, get drunk and nothing else would matter. Slowly, he closed his eyes with the vision of a dozen or so hazy gnoll’s walking after the first. With his last gulp of air, he slept.<p><center>
**********************************************<p>
<b>Chapter One</b><br><i>An Attack?</i></center><p>
     Cries filled the air, and trumpets blasted. Men in armor ran towards the front gates, swords drawn. The commotion of the town woke all, boys ran the streets calling all to arms. An attack from the gnoll’s was approaching. The routine, however, was common enough. Most even stayed in their houses, claiming that if it were bad enough they would do more protecting their families than to laugh at the clumsy gnolls and their unplanned attacks.<p>
