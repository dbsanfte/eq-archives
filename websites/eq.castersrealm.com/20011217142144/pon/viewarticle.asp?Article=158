<p><b>Project M</b></p>
<p>Tonight we have patched something to the PvP servers that many players have
been waiting for. The ability to play that gnoll, orc, or the cute and fuzzy
rat. On your character select screen you will notice another button in the upper
right part of your screen called &quot;Monster&quot;. Clicking this button will
randomly place you in a low-level NPC in a random zone. You will be given full
control of the creature to do with it what you like. You may hunt and kill other
creatures. You may even attack other players.</p>
<p>Some things to remember when playing your own personal monster (NPC).</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will not be able to interact with players or NPC's other than moving
    and hitting attack. -You cannot speak, trade, sell, or do anything else that
    a player can do.
  <li>You will spawn with normal loot for the monster you are playing and Player
    Characters will be able to kill you for loot and experience.
  <li>If you are a spell casting monster you might want to take a moment to
    memorize some spells.
  <li>Once you die, you will return to the character select screen where you may
    choose to return as another NPC or play your normal character.
  <li>You may gain experience, levels, and skills as this NPC, but once you die,
    it is all lost. You will need to start over the next time you choose to be a
    NPC character.
  <li>You can't zone as a monster. If you try to cross a zone-boarder you will
    lose your progress and return to the character-select screen.
  <li>Monster PCs (MPCs) can not loot, sell, or gain items. They only get what
    they start out with.
  <li>This ability to play a monster is being implemented for PvP servers only
    as we have no plans to implement non-consensual PvP on a non PvP server.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we are still working with this system. We may find other ways to
implement Project M on the non-PvP servers that are acceptable. We aren't done
looking at the possible uses of this new feature.</p>
<p><b>PvP Server Related</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Guards, when seeing PCs in combat, will now attack the one that they like
    the least (the one with the lowest appropriate faction). If all the PCs
    involved are highly regarded (have very high faction) the guards will allow
    them to resolve their own issues without interfering.
  <li>Guards should also refrain from attacking PCs that are attacked by pets of
    any sort.
  <li>Sullon Zek now has an across the board experience bonus of 20%, and the
    experience loss on all deaths on Sullon Zek is now 50% less.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Zone Specific Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Kael now has specific bind locations, located only at the entryways. This
    means that binding will only be possible in those areas.
  <li>Trivial Loot code has been removed from the Stonebrunt Mountains and the
    Warrens.
  <li>Added a melee bind location to the dock in Iceclad.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug Fixes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug that allowed corpses to get stuck inside walls while creating
    a phantom corpse at the zone line (on your client only) with which you could
    not interact. Now if a corpse ends up in a location that is not 'valid' the
    corpse will be moved to the 'default coordinates' of the zone. Also, the
    /corpse command will now summon your own corpse to you anywhere in the zone
    as long as that corpse is on the default coordinates. As a rule of thumb, if
    you died near a wall and cannot find your corpse where you died, try /corpse
    before petitioning.
  <li>Fixed it so that Critical Hit damage messages match the actual damage
    done.
  <li>The visible damage bonus modifier on two-handed weapons has been
    corrected. The value that was displayed was incorrect, no change has been
    made to the damage bonus itself.
  <li>Fixed a language-learning bug on the Firiona Vie Server. Players will now
    be train each other up in languages once they train the first point with
    their guildmaster.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Item Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue with the Bardic Epic weapon. Now if the bard has his Epic
    and an instrument that gives bonuses to songs, the best effect will take
    precedence, rather than the Epic bonuses always being used.
  <li>Cloak of Imperception should now have charges. You will need to exchange
    your old one for a new one with your GM within the next five days.
  <li>Donal's Chestplate of Mourning has unlimited charges again. You will
    likewise need to exchange yours should you get an 'out of charges' message
    when attempting to use it.</li>
</ul>
<b>Gameplay/Interface Changes/Additions</b>
<ul>
  <li>We have changed the way the /consider command works and expanded the level
    range at which players are able to gain experience. We have added a 'light
    blue' area between green and blue. NPCs that used to /consider green but
    gave experience will now /consider light blue, as well as NPCs of slightly
    lower level than those greens. You will always get experience for something
    that is light blue. You will not receive experience for greens. At the same
    time, by including lower level NPCs in the light blue /consider, we have
    increased the range of lower level NPCs that will grant experience. This
    will be most noticeable for characters of higher level.
  <li>Added /targetgroupbuff. Type /targetgroupbuff on to activate, off to turn
    it off. When on, all group buff spells you cast will require a target but
    will affect everyone grouped (and in range) with that target, even if it is
    not your own group. When it is off your group buff spells will act normally.
    This will only work with group buffs that have a duration, and will not
    affect heals, portals or change form spells.
  <li>Added code that will put one item onto your cursor if it won't fit into
    your inventory due to a cancelled trade or looting items (and other cases).
    This will only work if there is not already an item on the cursor.
  <li>Added code that prevents player characters from dropping coins on the
    ground. This should prevent the loss of coins due to accident or scam.
  <li>Made a modification to the chase camera mouselook code. Moving the mouse
    forward or back in this camera view will make the camera move up and down,
    and the camera also automatically pitches to keep your character in view.
  <li>You now see the number of hit points you are healed, and you also now see
    how many hit points you heal when healing others.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Skill Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Bard Piercing cap was raised to 250 at 60th level.
  <li>Foraging and Fishing will now result in a wider variety of items,
    especially in zones that have unusual items available to forage or fish
    (such as quest items). Quest and unique items were too common in zones that
    had them, often making it hard to use those skills to obtain items such as
    food and drink. These quest and rare items will now actually be rarely
    foraged or fished, as they should have been. Such items will still be
    available, even to those with low foraging skills, but they will be more
    easily found by those who have practiced the skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Norrathian News</b></p>
<p>Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the
arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers. Citizens rush to get a
copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and
community news for their hometowns.</p>
