Bards… hmmn the jack of many skills and the master of none. This is true to the extent that we can’t damage with our songs as much as a wizard or dish the melee damage like a monk or tank like a warrior or heal like a cleric, but we do have something no other class can claim, We CAN do it all and we make everyone around us better.<P>
  My guide will touch on starting race and stats, techniques and tricks, and appropriate fighting areas for certain levels. Of course this is all opinion but I have been successful up to Level 27 doing this.<P>
  The big debate on which race and who has the best stats. I say choose the one you like the look of and how they will interact with other players. The stats between wood elves, half elves, and humans is not so noticeable as to make you choose one just because of stats. I will list stats in order of importance to me. I feel the most important stat is agility. The higher it is the more the mobs miss you and that is ALWAYS a good thing. Strength and charisma are a close second each having an equal importance. As you may know bards can wear plate. Nice. It was intended that way because of the taunting power our songs radiate. Never underestimate Armor Class (AC) when you do get hit this will determine how much damage you take. With that said the higher your strength the more plate you can wear increasing your armor class. Charisma, that is a little more elusive in terms of seeing the effects of a higher number. This really determines how well you can sleep, lull, or charm a mob ( MOB being monsters). In the early levels it is not relevant but later on it sure does make a huge difference in how effective you are in those situations. Dexterity is the last of my four main stats and it is used in determining how well you target a creature for a strike (less misses) and in how often your weapons, the ones that have an effect, produce an effect in battle. Though as of this writing I am hearing more and more that it takes a real good jump in dexterity to produce a small increase in Procs (effects). Stamina, intelligence, and wisdom are all nice to keep high but with such emphasis on the other stats I have maybe a few points because of a side effect of one of my items i.e. Purity belt is +2 strength and ALSO +2 stamina. That is my take. I am a half elf bard because I felt it gave me the best balance of my four main stats. My starting stats Strength 95, stamina 70, agility 95, dexterity 95, wisdom 60, charisma 85, intelligence 75.<P> 
  The bard is hands down the hardest character to play effectively. No other character mixes in so many skills and so many different types of songs. Let me explain how songs works. Some songs you can sing continuously i.e. Chant of Battle so every 3-6 seconds the effect will be refreshed or “PULSE”. Other songs only play for a one time effect so you have to start the song again i.e Brusco’s Bellow. There is a tactic called TWISTING where you start a song until it “pulses” then stop it and start another song until it pulses to get the effect of both songs. This actually can be done for three songs. So if you twist right you can benefit from the effect of three different songs at the same time. How is that possible you may ask? Most songs after its initial pulse will remain in effect for an additional 2 more pulses. A bard that does not twist is an inefficient bard. Learn to do it early and perfect the practice as you will no doubt be doing this throughout your career. How do I do it? Well the easiest way to do it is to set up hotkeys so you only have to use the keyboard instead of the mouse. If you left click and hold on a song icon while in windowed mode it will attach that spell slot on your cursor. Just drop it on your hotkey bank. Do this for 5 more more songs and dedicate that hot key page for your songs and twist away.<P> 
  Twisting, what a great advantage for a bard. It gets better and more difficult. Bard songs sometimes require an instrument in order to play the song, while other songs will have their effects greatly increased if you use the right instrument. Twisting songs is one thing but twisting instruments at the same time to get the best effects can be a real challenge at first. I either use weapons and sing the songs or I twist instruments with songs. I never switch between instruments and weapons in battle. So I call them modes. Weapon mode or instrument mode. Instrument mode is the tricky one. You have to twist your songs as well as twist the instruments appropriate for that song. Again we go back to the hotkey page. Setup a separate page for instrument mode. Hotkey three songs and then hotkey your second melee slot and two inventory slots. Here is an example. Once you reach L18 you get a kick arse DOT song, Denon`s Disruptive Discord. You can sing but it packs a wallop if you use a brass instrument with it. Also Chords of Dissonace works the same way but using a lute increases its damage and of course Hymn of Restoration with a lute heals a lot more. This is my instrument attack setup. I use Hymn, Chords, then Denon’s I start Hymn with Lute in hand then twist in chords. All this while I have my brass in instrument on my mouse cursor. I twist in Denon’s and drop my brass horn into my hotkeyed melee slot and I am now using my brass for the Denon effect. I still have my lute on my cursor so I twist back to Hymn and drop my lute in that slot now and repeat the process. After a little practice it gets to be second nature. It pisses off the mobs but oh do you do damage.<P> 
  Ok you are on Twist overload. Lets talk about some tactics that will help to be more efficient in group and solo.<P> 
  In the group setting remember you are not the tank. Let me say that again, YOU ARE NOT THE TANK. Don’t be afraid to mix it up and take some damage to spread it out but don’t think you are the point man. In the lower levels this is easy to get used to because everyone is about equal attack and defense wise. Don’t let that cloud your tactics later on or you will be dying a lot. But there will be times when you are the only one that can tank and in those instances you must. But if there is another hybrid or a warrior amoung you let them be the point man. Before we go any further let me say that you most likely will end up being chewed on more than most because of the power of your songs to effect the whole group and the mobs don’t like that one bit. Our songs have massive taunting power so be wary. If you find yourself getting pounded quit playing your songs and stop attacking and let the warriors and other hybrids taunt. DON’T keep attacking and playing a song. In the lower levels Hymn of Restoration is a great group song in battle. The higher you go the more you will notice the mobs do way more damage and that heal song will taunt them like you wont believe so I advise not using it in battle unless you are using the all instrument attack because those songs will taunt anyway might as well heal. We have so many songs with different effects and it would be impossible to explain the tactics of all of them in a group setting. It depends a lot on the group makeup as well as the type of mobs you are fighting. Examples. EX 1 Tank heavy group fighting non casting creatures with a lot of hit points. Twist Anthem de arms, a debuff song to slow the mob’s attack rate like chain or binding  and mix in a bellow and alternate with Jaxon’s jig of vigor to keep everyone’s stamina up. Ex 2 multiple mobs no enchanter so you have to sleep them with Lullaby and twist in a bellow then back to lullaby. Don’t twist 3 when sleeping or don’t twist at all and keep starting and stopping Lullaby depending on number of mobs. These type of situations you will learn to adapt to and play the right songs at the right time. It takes practice and expect to fail because you will learn the most from what NOT to do.<P>
  Ahh Soloing as a bard. IMPOSSIBLE, not enough hit points, we can’t melee, so on so on. I am here to tell you it is possible and very effective. I spoke of Instrument mode with those three particular songs, Chords, Denon’s, and Hymn. Find a spot where you wont attract other mobs and sing away. It is very effective on blues and whites although a bit chancy on yellows. I still solo this way even at L27. Then there is always Kiting. You twist accelerando and bellow. First start with accelerando already on then bellow, then bellow again until it is close. Start to run then start up accelerando again and bellow until you get message out of range. Then stop and continue to bellow until it is in range. Kiting is a LONG process once you start it you can get a feel for how it works. There is another tactic some may say is cheesy, I don’t think so. If we are able to do it I say go for it. Others say that because they cant do it. First you chain the mob then you fear it and it runs away from you slowly allowing you to hack at it, damage it with song etc. This works best in outdoor areas where the mob has room to run. HEH don’t do this in dungeon because if the chain breaks he is running for his buddies. Another tactic is the charm. OK set up another hot key page and designate it for charming. Hotkey charm and accelerando and the pet commands /pet attack, and /pet target, and /pet guard me. Keep your drum equipped. The charm song has a good range so stay a good distance. Find two unsuspecting victims charm one. If it doesn’t work charm again until it does. Once charmed target the second one and issue the /pet attack command. Get some distance between you and the mob and sing accelerando in between for two  pulses then prepare to charm again. Make sure you target the same one.You cannot Charm a mob that is charmed less you break it, so once charmed you have to wait for it to break for you to re charm. Find out the health of the two foes and re charm the one with more health. Be careful though they will both be after you so keep some distance and run away while charming if you have to. I personally don’t solo a lot I like the group play.<P> 
  Where do I fight at this level and at that level? If you are starting in Kelethin then my suggestions are geared for you. Levels 1-4 Solo in the newbie grounds. This may seem like a time consuming effort instead of grouping but it gives you time to adequately allow your skills to flourish. Sing all the time and use all weapons available to you. Train in all your new skills. L5 I’d say solo still in Butcherblok. Killing large snakes and spiders you will level in no time. Other good spots for L5 are Qeynos hills, west Karana, West Commons, and North Ro. L6+ is prime grouping time with your new Healing song. Head to Orc Hill, Crushbone, Dwarf Skel or gob camps in Butcherblok or Bandit camps in Lesser Fay. Other good spots to from L6-12 are Bandits in North Ro, West and east commons, West Karana, Befallen, Black Burrow, Kerran Island, Misty Thicket, and Steamfont Mountains. L12 you are ready for some unrest beetles and yard trash or CB Slave pits and throne room . Get a good group and watch for trains but the exp is awesome. Other good spots L12-17 are Oasis, North Ro, Blackburrow, South Ro, Beholders Maze, Rathe Mountains in the day time, and LavaStorm Mountains. At L17 or so CB gets to be light on Exp and in Unrest the yard trash is too easy and the house pulls are too hard. Time to take a boat trip. Head over to Freeport buy a good supply of water get a bind and head straight to Oasis. Fight Deep water Crocs and Caimans grouped, and Crocs and caimans and maybe a DW solo. Do this until L19-20. Once you hit 20+ many doors open up to you. I personally went to Mistmoore and Unrest. Unrest seemed too trainy so I went to Mistmoore and man the exp is good there. Watch for the Graveyard and castle trains but get a group and learn the area and you should be fine. Other places I got good exp from L20-27 were Rathe mountains, South Karana Aviak city and outside of Splitpaw, North Karana, Runnyeye, Ocean of tears, Cauldron, and East Karana. I say go where the wind takes you. Group often and be as good as you can tactics wise and you will see re invites. That is my sell on the Bard class. TONS of fun! I know one thing once you go Selo’s you never go back J
