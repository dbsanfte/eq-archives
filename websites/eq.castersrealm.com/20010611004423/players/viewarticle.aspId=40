	<p>A single warrior, with gleaming armor, is perched upon a large rock kneeling towards a cavernous opening. There are upheavals of stone everywhere, almost as if organized. All are jagged and some are quite high, with the largest of them all being the one that the warrior is knelt upon.
	<p>The walls of the cavern are frozen, with icicles hanging from the ceiling. A flowing vapor struggles out of the opening, pushing against the rock that would imprison it, and is obviously the facet for all of the ice.
	<p>"Yes M'Lord. It has already been sent into action," said the stern but soft voice.
	<p>A slightly rugged but strong and loud voice replies from out of the cavity, "Excellent, perhaps we shall regain our prize." 
	<p>"That is our intentions sire. I will personally accompany the Shrubs and Goblins on this day. We shall return with our prize, as all is planned."
	<p>"We shall see. We have come far searching for it. It is yet to be in our grasp. We are not invincible, even you. Do not be weary of failure, this is only one possible path."
	<p>"Understood master. But would it not be grand if we succeed? I do not want to leave room for failure. It is what I live for sir," the warrior lifted their head, "I do not mind the battles."
	<p>"You are still young and have much to learn. I put much faith in you but do not demand it. Go, make the preparations, and return to me once more." 
	<p>"Yes M'Lord," standing and unsheathing a magnificant runed blade, "The night is ours!"
	<p>A chuckle is heard from the opening, and then silence. The warrior resheathes their blade and jumps off the stone, starting to walk towards a smaller opening almost opposite of the great gaping hole. They turn to look back but noticing the vapor is gone, continues forward.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>

	<p>Telsprital was very excited as he ran through the trees. Today would be his first day working with the men in the mines. He could not wait! They had finally accepted him. He ran on, as fast as he could, swimming through the woods while using the trees' gnarled roots and twisted boughs for direction. He knew the woods well and was building his way into a becoming a great ranger, whether he knew it or not.
	<p>He was a boy beginning the thirteenth season of his life. He had dark sandy hair that could cover his eyes, his dark brown eyes,  if he allowed it. He had a slight tan from running about in the sunlight and had a slender build. He was always climbing trees or accomplishing some other activity in the woods. The woods he called home, a second home anyway. He felt so comfortable here, almost as if he could stroll through it blindfolded and still see every tree and notice every bird.
	<p>Telsprital may have known the woods well but not well enough seemingly. He did not realize the tree that should not have been there. The tree that wasn't a tree at all but rather a Shrub Troll! A dark brown skinned creature with the ability to alter their color slightly. He was a tall gangly creature with nothing but a single, browned and stained, loin cloth. The troll was hidden behind a large tree in the background of the boys personal path, a creature made for this sort of thing. No untrained eyes would have been able to tell that it was there from just a glimpse. Of course, the troll saw the boy.
	<p>The troll was watching and following the young boy, never losing sight of him with his close, tight, eyes. Trolls have their eyes closer together with a keener vision than what humans normally have. They are generally not preyed upon unless in battle so nature found no need for wider vision, which was given up for enhanced eyesight for hunting in the dark.
	<p>The gangly creature, with it's long legs strolled gracefully through the woods, without sound or halter, after the boy with only one thought in mind, his hunger.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>

	<p>Telsprital could still hear the mens' laughter at his (seemingly) triumphant entrance. He was teased and joked upon and told to go stand watch outside. They never stood watch, he was a joke! He was hurt, he really wanted to work with them, he wanted to become a "Man." He decided that he would come and stand guard everyday, despite that guarding the entrance was a joke in their minds, so that they might see his heart was in desire of working along side them.
	<p>He wandered about the entrance of the mine, searching for something to occupy himself with. He began picking up stones and tossing them into the woods. The woods were not very large and met the mountain in a corner and opened up into a V shaped clearing with a path going around the woods, the long way to town. He only took that road when it was dark out.  Something about the woods frightened him at night, even though during the day it was a home for him. The road was boring and dull so whenever he could he take his path through the woods, where he could smell the trees and hear the birds, he took the chance. He could never grow tired of it all. He loved nature. It spoke to him.
	<p>He was startled by a large group of frightened birds flying out of the woods from behind  him. He was only set on that for a moment because suddenly a very loud blast was seemingly belched forth from the mine's entrance, causing a cave-in! He watched in horror as boulder after boulder was thrown from the entrance almost reaching the woods.
	<p>Telsprital ran to the entrance shouting and cursing, but he kept his cool. He quickly examined the entrance of the mine and the rubble out in front. He concluded that he alone could not help the trapped men inside, if they still lived. His intention was to return to town get help, but that would never happen.
	<p>He spun around on the tip of his left boot and abruptly stopped. About 20 feet in front of him stood a Shrub Troll. A creature of about 9 feet in height and 3 feet at the chest. It was dark brown with patches of lighter brown about it's body, with most of the patches below the upper torso ending up on the legs. It's face was oblong, with two centered round eyes set just above it's flat nose. The creature had no artificial weapons but it's teeth and hands alone were enough to send shivers down the boy's spine.
	<p>Telsprital's eyes darted about, scanning his surroundings for some sort of advantage (or so he thought), ultimately fixating upon the woods. He thought that if he could make it to the woods he would be safe. He could go and hide or outmaneuver the creature he assumed. He had no idea of what he was up against, the troll would have been upon him in an instant.
	<p>The troll, noticing the boy's glare, bound forward, more than halfing the gap betweeen them. Telsprital jumped backwards at this, right into the stones the mine had evacuated and stumbled onto his side. He looked up, only to see the gleeful smile on the trolls face, now only about 5 feet away...

<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>

	<p>It was so very nice to get out of that armor Nyylachni thought. It was so hot at times. She liked her armor very much, it has saved her life many a time when she was less experience, it was magical and held a bond with her sword. But this was her time now, the time for resting. She didn't like to wear the armor if she didn't have to. She had already given the orders to the army and all was well. She had sent some trolls to scout in the woods and some goblins to scout the mountain. All was well, so far at least. There was never any way of telling with the goblins and sometimes the trolls were unreliable as well. Their unreliability was the reason she came along on this important mission. She did not want to deal with a failure, especially with a matter such as this. In her eyes,a failure on this mission would truly set them back. 
	<p>She sighed, tilted her head back against the small cliff wall and closed her eyes. She loved when all was quiet, especially at night. Despite being a dark elf, she still loved beauty and disliked much of the other evils. She could tolerate the trolls but the goblins made her irate. How stupid they were! She could not stand them trying to conversate with her. They shouldn't even be alive. They are ugly, smelly, and stupid; not that trolls aren't but that goblins outmatch them in these instances. Nyylachni shook her head trying to chase away those thoughts that were stirring her anger.
	<p>She fluffed her hair, her beautiful hair. It was below her shoulders about midway to her elbows. It was a milky, silvery-white with a slight light blue illuminence. Her eyes were a deep blood-blue. Not blood-red, but blood-blue.She was a young and very beautiful dark elf. She had all the curves a woman would ever need. A prize for any that desired her. 
	<p>She opened her eyes, taking in the view. She could see into the woods where the trolls were, wrapping itself along the mountain. There were birds chirping in the tops of  the trees. She smiled and took a deep breath, knowing that all she had to do was wait until nightfall. Or so she assumed.
	<p>In an instant Nyylachni sprang to her feet. She could feel the strength of the land in the air. Something was releasing great amounts of energies. The miners reached their goal early! This was very bad. With the end of that thought, the mountain shook and a great explosion could be heard. She ran the corner making the mine entrance visible. There was rubble everywhere, the cave had just had a massive cave-in! At least one of the trolls was there already. But at a closer look it seemed as though he was not there because of the disruption, the troll was assualting a young boy. How that filled her with rage! He should be rallying the troops like his duty commands! No matter, she was there at least.  Her first thought was to send the call of rallying the army, but instead of gathering the goblins and trolls she just stood there with her eyes fixated upon something. The something she was staring at was a Lunar Giant! This was definately not good!
	<p>Nyylachni ran back to where her armor lay and picked up a grand sword lying beside it. It was called The Thirsted Blade, a magnificantlly runed two-handed blade with magical energies. When grasped the blade's runes shone a bright green, and while connecting with her mind and body the blade's magical properties grew.
	<p>She took one last look at her armor and decided against it, the giant shouldn't prove too difficult, and if he was more than what he seemed she would enjoy the fight. She ran back along the side of the mountain just in time to see the giant soaring through the air and then drive his short sword through the trolls upper shoulder and down through body, with the sword exiting at the pelvis. She had no time to plan an assualt and started jumping down the side of the mountain in nothing but her armor undergarments and her boots; the undergarments were a slighty tight fighting pair of grey silk pants with a top to match, the boots closely resembled marble stone but obviously could not have been.
	<p>When she arrived at the bottom of the mountain the giant was waiting for her and the boy had scrambled to his feet and was back against the mountain side. This would be fun she thought. Being a Lunar Giant he was smaller than every other kind of giant that inhabited the world, but definately not making him weaker! He was only about 14 feet tall, two feet taller than the tallest trolls, with his chest at a burly six and half feet! He had on the armor of his assemblence, a magically enchanted type of cloth. It had strands of silk-like threads coming out of it, with a rune placed on the back. She did not see the rune from this angle but knew it ws there. The rune granted increased thought, strength, and defense. No matter, those would not help him.
	<p>She charged towards the giant at an angle so that she could jump back at the last second. The giant foresaw this and kept his stance. Nyylachni grinned an evil grin, one the giant did not appreciate the slightest. He knew he could not win, not against her. He had seen her in battle before. She had easily dispatched a dozen of his kind. She was toying with him and there was not a thing he could do. She planned to throw bolts at the giant, forcing him to begin moving. But instead her attention was drawn somewhere else.
	<p>"Cease at once!" a voice boomed before Nyylachni could butcher the fearful giant.
	<p>She let loose an evil grin,"You have no power over me in that realm my friend!" Nyylachni snapped back while gazing about the area. She knew what manner of being it was. She was schooled well.
	<p>Suddenly a form started to materialize in between her and the giant. It was a seraph. It resembled a human but was taller, had more muscle tone and was fairer skinned. It would be safe to say he was as fair as the High Elves as far as skin was concerned, and easily more beautiful. Despite what some would like to believe, seraphs cannot fly upon their wings. They are what keep the seraph in this world, as seraphs are etheral and do not normally exist on the physical plane. These wings are more like a vastly set of branching antlers that look like pure light. He was donning the seraphs army's normal armor and normal sword, both exceptionally powerful if compared against any "normal" weapon of the physical plane.
	<p>Nyylachni laughed and addressed the seraph, "I hope for your sake that you were born one of the stronger ones!" You see, a seraph's strength is static, what power they are born with is the only power they can have. They do not have souls and so cannot grow in strenth over time as can the beings in the physical realm. They start out much stronger than the one's with soul, and are in fact stronger. That is not to say that a souled being cannot overcome the seraph, it is quite possible.
	<p>"Let us see," said the seraph and wasting no time lunged at the Dark Elf with his own two-handed weapon. Nyylachni sprang back, holding The Thirsted Blade before her. The swords runes flashed blue and discharged a bolt of lighting. The seraph glowed bright for but a mere moment and the bolt was gone.
	<p>Very well, no fooling around with this one she thought. She had not the time nor desire to use minimal energy, you could never be too sure with these creatures. Her body glowed bright red as she raced towards the seraph with blade in hand. She swung at the seraph, anticipating his dodge. The bright red aura around her drained from her body and into the sword, extending itself using the erie red glow. The red shaft just missed the seraph but hit it's mark just the same. Quite easy she thought to herself.
	<p>The seraph dropped his sword and let loose a scream as he was badly injured. The red glow was a venom, and it was already draining him of his energies and transporting them to Nyylachni. The giant was also hit and was down on his knees, clutching his thighs. The seraph was now quickly phasing between the physical and etheral realm. The attack was a good one. It was a very devastating manuvear that had cut through his armor. There was only one thing he could do now...
	<p>The seraph dissolved his physical form and turned himself into etheral matter, he would not hold onto the physical world for long in this shape so he acted quickly. He used his remaining energies to envenlope himself around the Dark Elf, trying to gain control of her mind. Nyylachni struggled to free herself but could not, the seraph was using too much energy for her to simply break free but was not strong enough to gain even the slightest bit of knowledge. At the rate of which he was expending energy he would surely die in precious mere seconds.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>

	<p>Telsprital thought that surely this was his end. Again, he was wrong. To his amazement a gigantic being leapt through the air and sliced through the troll's body. The troll was dead before it reached the ground. He realized that it was a giant, but unlike any he had seen. He stared in awe at the new type of creature, not knowing to be thankful or afraid.
	<p>"Find somewhere safe, just try to get away from here," said the giant turning his eyes upon the boy. "There is a strong adversary coming down the mountain, if you wish to survive then you must go."
	<p>Telsprital nodded and not knowing what to do turned around and started to run up the side of the mountain that the mine was on and stopped. The Dark Elf had caught his eye. He had heard tales of the evil elves but never had he seen one, and none of the stories ever told of their beauty. He disregarded that last thought of his, this being was evil and did not deserve compassion, but was still equally beautiful.
	<p>By this time the giant and Dark Elf were simply just staring at each other. It was a very tense moment, the Dark Elf grinned and seemed as if she was poised to strike. To his amazement something very strange was happening around him. The wind picked up and he felt very short of breath - something was displacing the air around him. He could hear words around him and his vision blurred. He dropped to the ground and weakly looked up. In front of him he once again saw a being that he believed he would never see, a seraph. In an instant the Dark Elf  jumped back and then charged with the sword. There was a flash of red and the seraph was screaming in agonizing pain. He had missed something. He never saw the lightning bolt or the sword's erie glow touch the seraph. His untrained human eyes could not keep up with that type of power or speed. Or maybe it was just the air choking him, either way it did not matter for the last thing he saw was the mighty giant on his knees.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>

	<p>A large calling rang out among the mountains. Scores of Lunar Giants swamped the mine entrance and the encompassing area. A very powerful sorcerer had teleported them all there. The large planear rip forced the almost dead seraph back into the etheral realm, sparing his life. Nyylachni was astonished. She knew what kind of power the sorcerer was wielding to be able to teleport that many beings unscathed. She knew she could not win and so did her master.
	<p>"Fall back, you did well. I have no need to lose you. I have other plans for you." was the telepathic message from her master.
	<p>"Master, I may abe able to take down a large number of them if I use enough strength. I will have enough left to return to you. They shall not best me."
	<p>"No you will not, I shall not lose my best Dragoon!" the voice echoed throughout her head, "Return to me NOW!"
	<p>With that  Nyylachni again glowed bright red, absorbing the light around her, and melted away into the atmosphere. 
	<p>"But master," she protested while trying to scout for the wizard among the giants. She had made herself invisible. She was partly in the etheral realm and partly in the physical. Quite dangerous if you do not know what you are doing. "I may have a large advantage."
	<p>"Did you already forget about the sorcerer, or what about the seraph? Both can see and sense you if they willed it. Do not forget that the seraphs will not let one of their own fall so easily, we do not need them to interfere. If you question me once more I will have to take action. Do not make me do so."
	<p>"Yes master."
	<p>Nyylachni darted into the woods in her invisible form and proceded towards the encampment hidden in the valley between the mountains. What she saw astonished her, dead trolls and goblins everywhere. At first she thought it was the Lunar Giants, but it wasn't. There would have been many foot prints in the ground, there was none. By the residual energy she could tell it was done by a single person. It was a power she had never felt before. In her awe she lost her concentration and reappeared in the physical realm. That was her first mistake. She stepped into the open clearing trying to get a feel for the energy. Second mistake. It was not the sorcerer that had teleported the giants. Who was it, and why? Who knew where they were, who had the strength for that type of destruction alone? The bodies where not massacred, they were killed by magical means. There were sores and blisters covering much of the bodies. She could not discern this meaning.
	<p>She slowly left the encampment and started up the mountain to where her armor lay. That would be her third mistake. The mountain side was covered mostly by the trees from the woods and so she was hidden from the rest of the world. She walked towards her armor in a very disappointed manner. As she came upon her armor The Thirsted Blade trembled. She had never experienced that before. Something very powerful was near, something she could not put her mind to. She stood there searching for the flow of energy more than she was searching for answers. She went to pick up her magical armor but when she touched the breastplate it rusted and shattered! Her magical armor! How could this be? The power that bound her armor was great indeed. She attempted to gather the rest of her armor but it all rusted away at her touch. She was frightened at this point. Something was sending her a message and she received it loud and clear.
	<p>"Master! Master!" was the fearful telepathic message that she sent out.
	<p>She again felt the great flow of energies that she felt earlier, but not as strong, "Your master cannot hear you," was the scornful reply.
	<p>"Who is this?!"
	<p>Laughter filled her mind, "What is wrong? Is the Dragoon of Dissention fearing for her petty life?"
	<p>Nyylachni backed herself against the cliff. Never in her life has she experienced more fear than what she was experiencing. Who knew her name? What living creature knew her name? Only the ones about to be consumed by her strength heard that name. This new foe was far greater than she, and quite possibly stronger than her master. She knew because this being had broken and blocked the telepathic link that she and her master shared. She scanned the area but found nothing. No traces of anything. No signs, no footsteps or fallen rocks. Nothing.
	<p>"Who is this?!" she repeated, the fear plainly heard in her mental voice.
	<p>"I am... a Sentinal. Let me rephrase that, the Sentinal. I am the only one left. But there will be more again."
	<p>"A Sentinal? What is that?"
	<p>Again the laughter, "My, you have led a sheltered life have you not?" the voice chuckled. "We are the protecters of nature. We go about and protect the world and it's inhabitants at our master's wish. Well, we did anyway."
	<p>Nyylachni eased up,still scouting her surroundings, it was obvious that this Sentinal wanted to speak with her. For the time being at least. "I don't quite understand. Who is your master?"
	<p>"The love of all nature."
	<p>"Impossible!" Nyylachni screached turning in circles. "Your god is dead! Along with the rest of the gods!"
	<p>"Is that what they tell you?" A thunderous laughter echoed throughout her head, "No wonder you are weak!"
	<p>Usually she would not allow someone to call her weak but in this instance she was comparibly weak, and she knew. She moved away from the cliff and back to where her armor previously lay.
	<p>The voice rang through her head once more, but this time with grunts and undiscernable noise. "So your master wishes your presence. So be it. We shall meet one day."
	<p>"Nyylachni!" It was her master. "I thought I told you to leave there!"
	<p>"I tried master. I had to come back for my armor. All the trolls and goblins were killed!"
	<p>"I know!" her master replyed, "Just return to me."
	<p>"Master, I think I am being watched. How can I leave?"
	<p>"The Sentinal is not around you. I shall explain later, just return!"
	<p>"Yes master, right away." This time she really did return to him immediately, but while still filled with the fear of power that she felt and the thought of her destroyed armor she would not fully rest until she found her answers. Those answers were far off. Very far off.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>

	<p>As he used all of his energy to contain the dark warrior Nadariel knew that his original plan would not succeed. She was already resisting the first stage of the technique too much. He would surely die, he had not the strength to return to his own plane. 
	<p>In an instant he was once again in his normal being. He was very weak. What had happened? He had been shot back into the etheral realm. He was quite relieved at this. He had not the intentions of dying this day, nor did he want to. He was lucky to survive. Challenging the Dark Elf was so very foolish of him, he could sense her raw strength. As he lay on the floor trying to regain his energy, he could only run over the thoughts of today in his mind. It started out very organized, a normal day indeed. They knew Traxzor would make his move today. They had the vicinity of where the Mana Stone resided but not the exact location. It made no difference. They would simply cover the area. They knew it was hidden somewhere about the area of the Na'Dfal (na-fall) woods and mountains. Ah, those woods. The Na'Dfal woods. His thoughts began to trail off. He remembers they used to house the great elves of the same name. But that was a long time ago before the great war, the war which was now beginning to repeat itself..
	<p>He was not of existence when that war was had. But he knew of it. It was a war originally fought between the forces of light and darkness. How that thought filled him with humor as he remembered what he was told had occured, no one could have seen that coming. With a very strange turn of events the evil started fighting amongst itself. He did not know the details but knew that gods were destroyed and created and this Mana Stone played a major role in the war.
	<p>Nadariel stood up. His strength was returning quickly, as always. The young seraph took a look around him. The etheral realm was very much like the physical plane, although very much different. The planet's form existed in both planes, though in a different state. Whatever non-living material was on the physical plane existed on the etheral, with some slight modifications. The land was always churning with the mana given off from it. Swooping, looping, streaming. Always flowing like water, and always shifting between colors of the natural spectrum. An endless rainbow. Most of the time anyway. It did occasionally turn white, or black for that matter. At other times the mana would go clear, as if it did not exist. It was always refreshing to stare at the mana, the blood of existence.
	<p>Oh sure, there was trees and other objects on this world of his also. Anything that did not possess a soul was visible.Anything that was alive anyway, it was just in mana form. The trees could be seen in their form because they gave off mana. They bent it seemed, like everything else, when the mana flowed out of them which was always. But you could always tell what really was the tree, and it was solid too. Just like on the physical plane. To him, he lives on the physical plane. That is his world, his life. He enjoys it as he can.
	<p>Sometimes he envyed the souled ones, they grew in strength. They had the potential to anyway. Not all of them grew in strength. The power to expand also comes with the power to contract. Such is why souls die. If you are not growing then you are weakening. That is the road to power. It is sad that no one has the choice though. 
	<p>After staring off into the distance, while collecting his thoughts, Nadariel took a look at his armor. It was very much destroyed. She is quite powerful Nadariel thought to himself. Lucky for him something pushed him back into his world. Lucky for the giant and young boy that he was there to intervine. That thought started to make him wonder about the fate of those two. He proceeded to fix the armor. It was made of mana, and conciousness. The same way he traveled to the physical realm. Which reminded him that he must go.
	<p>He stood there, gathering his conciousness and in an instant he was physical. He was not at full strength and so the weight of gravity pulled his body down slightly when he traversed the planes. Becoming accustomed to the natural pull, he straightened out his body and looked around. The clearing was bare. There was nothing there. He was lucky. He should have looked into the physical world before he came there. I'll have to remember that next time he thought.
	<p>He could tell that there were many large beings here by the sheer number and size of footprints. But that was long ago. The sky was now waning and showing signs of dusk. He had taken longer to heal than previously thought. As he began to overlook the clearing several forms were coming into appearance, more seraphs! Nadariel prepared himself for the telling of the sudden turning events. 
	<p>As soon as the collective of seraphs was there, all eight-teen of them, Nadariel began to explain to them what had happened. He explained that he was scouting ahead, looking for the enemy forces. He quickly came to the topic of the mine and it's cave-in. That was of great interest to the rest of the seraphs. Even if the Mana Stone was found there should not have been an explosion, the Mana Stone just simply isn't capable of that. He then told them of how he returned to the mine entrance and found the dark elf ready to cut down the giant. This was also of much importance to them. Their reports told only of goblins and trolls. There had been no other creatures in the previous attempts of locating the Mana Stone. The most difficult part of that story was explaining how he was bested in combat with a single strike. That last part caused the seraphs to erupt in dismay. Nadariel was not the strongest nor the weakest seraph, but he was a seraph. For a mortal creature to best him so easily was not a good sign.
	<p>Nadariel explained as best as he could the mechanics of the wound he had received. According to the more experienced seraphs the wound was very physically straining and he was very fortunate to be returned the etheral realm. He was glad that he was returned to his home world. With that, they felt they were done and went back to report.
	<p>As Nadariel was preparing to dematerialize, he noticed a stain on the floor. It was blood. His blood. The thought of that scared him. He had never bled before. Had any seraph he wondered? Were did this girl come from? and what of the sword? It had great magical properties. He had seen it while in the etheral realm. Not the girl, just the sword. He had forgotten about that detail, until now. He believed it was quite possible that the wound that he had received was not just physical. Was his life in danger? He quickly dismissed that question, of all the nonsense. He was still alive. All of these events posed questions in his mind. What was going on?, but beyond that question, What of the sword? He could not grasp that idea. He had never heard of non-living objects existing in both dimensions. In fact, it was deemed impossible.
	<p>His thoughts raced through his mind as he returned home to the rest of the seraphs. Thoughts he could not answer. Thoughts he would not share. How he wished to be stronger, how he wished he had a soul to grow. If he is able to die without a soul and not be able to grow  in strength, why is it said to be better than to be able to die with a soul with the ability to grow? How strange it seemed that a gift of such power is looked down upon. It is strange this world we live in, is it not?
