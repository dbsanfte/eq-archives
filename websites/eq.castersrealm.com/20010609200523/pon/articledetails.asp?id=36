<tr> 
<td width='80%'><P align=left>Greetings all,</P>
<P align=left>I do not like to "rant" much. I love the game and 
I appreciate all of the things Verant and team goes through every day.  But if 
I hear from Brad or Gordon once more about how Paladin Quests are moral 
dilemmas, I WILL SCREAM!!!!!</P>
<P>Unless Verant feels it is acceptable for Paladins to be 
running around in Steel Armour and wielding Fine Steel 2 Handed Swords, there is 
a serious issue here.  The name of the game is EverQUEST.  What other choices do 
we truly have in playing this game?  Aside from being completely worthless at 
higher levels using an FS blade, or a Ykesha if we can beat back the Rangers 
looking for one, what choice do we have? NONE.</P>
<P>We <u>have</u> to get our Quest Armour to keep pace with the 
other members in our party.  We <u>have</u> to get a weapon that works well and 
hopefully puts out enough damage to make us feel helpful.  And <I>most 
importantly</I>, we <u>have</u> to Quest.  That is why most of us purchased this game.  
That's right, I <i>chose</i> to be a Paladin, so I would like to Quest as a Paladin, 
fight as a Paladin and play like a Paladin.</P>
<P>Now the three major examples we have to look at are 
Ghoulbane, Armour of Ro and Fiery Avenger. </P>
<P><B>Ghoulbane - </B>This blade is needed for the Fiery Avenger, and hence
Fiery Defender quests.&nbsp; But looking back on history, a Paladin killed the Shin Lord 
one day and got Ghoulbane, saw the stats, told all his friends and it became one 
of the the most valuable items in the game.  Suddenly, we realize that Frogloks 
are not necessarily evil.  They are neutral to good at best.  They hate Trolls, 
and have allied themselves with the Minotaurs in Lower Guk to destroy their 
undead counterparts who threaten to overrun their once great Kingdom.  The Shin 
Lord, one of the Frogloks greatest Paladins, wields the famed Ghoulbane. </P>
<P><B>Verant's position : </B>Will you kill a neutral to good creature who would never attack you 
unless provoked? </P>
<P><B>Paladin's viewpoint :</B> Yes, we do 
not <I>have</I> to kill him.  Yes, a FS Longsword does respectable damage.  
Even 2 FS Longswords do respectable damage, of course Paladins do not get dual 
wield (nor should we).  Ghoulbane is the one of the only blades that makes a Paladin worth 
his/her salt after level 30.   Is it acceptable for a Paladin to wield a Fine 
Steel Longsword, or a Blackened Iron Bastard Sword until level 40+, at which 
time an assault on Sir Lucan is possible?  </P>
<P><B>Solution : </B>Make a Quest, let the 
Shin Lord give us the blade upon handing in items.  Stop the unnecessary "moral" 
tactics to cover up bad writing and lack of originality.  The hidden saga of the 
Frogloks battles and history are great!  Why stop there?  Give us the Quest, 
give us an opportunity to become <I>part</I> of the story.  OR, give us another 
blade that requires some half intelligent Quest that allows us to gain a decent 
weapon without infringing on a "neutral or good" race.</P>
<P>Some would argue that Ghoulbane or your weapon does not 
"make" or "break" you.  Paladins and ShadowKnights are not given the ability to 
Dual Wield for obvious reasons.  This makes it necessary for our classes to have 
a decent one handed slashing weapon.  Many see Paladins as Sword and Shield.  
With the removal of Fiery Avenger and Ghoulbane, due to "moral" issues (read: 
bad writing or ideas).  One of our main weapons would be SoulFire.  That is 
fine, but it excludes 90% of Paladins from getting it (must be 40+).  Do not 
<I>give </I>us a good blade, make us <I>work </I>for it.  Give us moral 
dilemmas, <I>but </I>give us the opportunity to have a choice.  To have it or 
not at all is not a choice.  I have heard recently that there may be an 
alternate way of getting Fairy Dust through a Quest in Ak'Anon.  That would be 
great!  But, we are all dubious to KOS from killing Clockworks in Solusek's Eye 
for Melatite.  Why do all of the other classes just go to a Merchant and buy 
their gems?  </P>
<P><B>Armour of Ro - </B>The Quests for the 
Molds are quite respectable.  Aside from half being insanely difficult, the 
Quests are quite fun and challenging.  Again, the <u>only </u>Quest Armour Paladins are 
capable of getting are linked to a neutral/evil God and require the destruction 
of neutral/good beings.  How many Paladins worship Ro?  Why would we want Armour 
linked to a borderline Evil God?  What other choice do we have?  Steel Armour or 
Planes Armour when we reach 46(when it drops).  That brings us to Ronium.  Kill 
Clockworks and Fairies.  I don't want to.  No Ro Armour for you.  I will buy 
it?  No good, you are still condoning the death of innocent/neutral or good 
creatures. </P>
<P><B>Verant's position :</B> Will you 
kill creatures of a PC race (Gnome Clockworks) or Fairies to obtain a small 
amount of what you require to make your Armour of Ro?</P>
<P><B>Paladin's viewpoint :</B> Completely unacceptable.  I 
don't want to kill Fairies.  Thanks to the Goblins in Solusek's Eye, I was able 
to purchase full Steel Armour at around level 33+.  Can I be expected to wear 
this armour until I reach 46+ and try for Planes Armour?  What other items are 
available that have the AC of Steel and stat buffs of other types?  
None. </P>
<P><B>Fiery Avenger - </B>The 
Quest was great fun and I am glad we all came together to work it out!  It was a 
lot of fun and makes everyone happy thinking about wielding that great blade! 
But <u>no</u> Paladin can receive FA without condoning or participating in the 
slaughter of Frogloks. </P>
<P>There are a few more Quests that contain more questionable 
practices (Test of Truth, Deep Six Cutlass) but I think you get the idea.  
Verant smiles smugly and tells us these are moral dilemmas we must decide upon.  
I say to Verant, what is left of your game if Paladins refused to do the evil 
things you want them to? Nothing, why would we play a game that is <I>made 
</I>to destroy our ideals?  We <I>need </I>the option to complete them a 
different way in the way you have created them.  A word needs to be said of the 
other class Quests.  On the whole, these Quests have been great!  Rogue Armour 
is a little boring, Bard Armour is a little too easy and Warrior Armour was 
<I>amazing </I>when you released it.  Yes, one of my Companions is a Warrior and 
we had a GREAT time getting his Crafted Armour.  It left me very excited to work 
on my own.  </P>
<P>Does this sound like every Quest can and will conflict with 
some Paladin's views or beliefs?  No.  A little creativity will go a LONG way.  
As mentioned previously, make the Shin Lord give us a Quest.  Tell us he is a 
sick froggie, his leg is gimp and he can't fight anymore.  Retrieve this and 
this and this and we will give you Ghoulbane to assist all froggy kind in our 
Crusade!  At least getting three NO DROP items would be more difficult than 
standing in a mossy room and killing a frog when he spawns.  Armour of Ro?  Umm, 
it is not difficult to add an NPC to Qeynos, Felwithe, Erudin and Freeport, etc. 
and have him give the Armour out.  The Blacksmithing component has been 
removed.  Have a Dwarf standing outside of Groflah's in Freeport.  Hand him the 
bar of Ronium and the Mold.  He gives you the Armour piece.  And look, it is 
called the Armour of Marr!  I, a <I>PALADIN, </I>have proved myself worthy to my 
God, Mithaniel Marr and he has gifted me with his blessings upon my armour.  Is 
it too difficult to have different names on the same item?  Make Erud Armour, 
Armour of Prexus, etc etc.  Leave the name Ronium as a Fire God would be 
suitable for smelting metal. Leave Lord Searfire and the Cauldron component, it 
is fine. See?  I solved about half of the problems right there (with 
fixing the Fairy and Melatite drops on something else or on a Merchant).  And I 
can even fix that.  Put Melatite for sale in Ak'Anon or Solusek's Eye.  Remove 
the Fairy Dust component and make it Undead Froglok tongues.  Wouldn't putting 
some components or achievements on Undead creatures make a lot of 
sense?</P>
<P><B>The Future</B></P>
<P>What saddens me in all of this, is the complete dependence 
of material items.  In UO (that was a long time ago) the characters had a 
personality, or were more reliant on their skills and reputation to make 
relationships and successful adventuring work.  Now, to clear the air, EQ is a 
far superior game to UO.  I am glad it is here and it truly is exciting to think 
about the future.  EQ <I>brought</I> us that future and pleased us all!  But the 
addition of stat based Equipment lends EQ a major flaw.  The removal of 
"personality" or ability.  In EQ, if you do not have the equipment, you do not 
measure up to the task.  Sure, you can roleplay and make friends and co-operate 
and go on Planes raids and help a little.  BUT, you CANNOT assist or be a large 
force in a group without good equipment.   It is a shame and I hope the day 
comes when equipment plays <I>less</I> of a role, and the <I>character</I> is 
more important.  A little UO story that my Companions would surely back up. :-)  
I played a Paladin in UO.  Yes, I did not have one offensive spell in my Spell 
book, did not use Archery (nor do I as a human in EQ) and fought with a Halberd 
or Sword/Shield.  I was at a SEVERE disadvantage in PvP but worked quite well in 
PvE situations.  The secret was, I still made a difference, be that interrupting 
or scaring casters, or taking the hits while my Companions blasted everything 
they could. :-)  I also made an Archer, right before OSI improved it.  I fought 
with a Longsword in close melee and used my bow 90% of the time.  Although I was 
quite useless, I added flavour and fun for my group.  It was quite amusing when 
a month later, OSI put in the Archery fixes and it became on of the best skills 
in the game.  But alas, I had retired Connor and was focusing solely on my 
Paladin.  In EQ, in a group of 6, you do not have room for flavour.  If you are 
not a contributing member, you are endangering the life span of your group.  I 
am level 39 right now.  They keep looking at me funny when I put away Ghoulbane 
and fight with a Shiny Brass Shield and Fine Steel Longsword.  I will <I>NOT 
</I>use the Mistmoore Shield <I>OR </I>the Shield of the Slain Unicorn.  And I 
cannot use Ghoulbane because I would have to slaughter what amounts to an ally 
(Frogloks kill Trolls).</P>
<P align=left>I think a little more clarification on EQ and UO 
needs to be made.  I think UO gave us much more leeway and choice.  I <I>could 
choose</I> to be a Paladin, run around with a slow halberd and still be 
effective.  I like to think of UO as having a better "character" base.  I prefer 
a class based system (EQ), and Verant delivered a better, faster and more 
enjoyable game.  What does it lack?  The <I>depth</I> of character.  You are 
only as good as your equipment.  We can only <I>dream</I> of what the future 
will hold.  Could you imagine a world with the beauty and magic of EQ, and the 
character and personality of UO?  Verant! Please let EQ2 be the answer!  MAKE 
our Quests have alternative solutions, make equipment be an improvement, not a 
necessity, make our Quests challenging and difficult! Make them have a 
storyline, a <I>logical </I>outcome and solution.  I know <I>hundreds</I> of 
Paladins on this site who could give ideas, Quests and dilemmas that would keep 
us coming back for more!</P>
<P>I am sure you are wondering what my position is in all of 
this.  I will tell you.  I kill Fairies, I kill Clockworks, I even kill the cute 
little Gnomes when they aggro on me.  I wield Ghoulbane and get excited every 
time it procs.  Would I have EVER done those things if Verant had <i>truly</i> given 
me a choice? No.  Now, in history, or RL, we would be faced with real choices, 
in EQ we are faced with one option, do it and get the equipment or get nothing 
and do not participate in Paladin Quests. Of course, what is there to EQ for a 
Paladin without Armour of Ro, Ghoulbane or Fiery Avenger?  Am I less of a 
Paladin for these practices?  I would argue that in the context of EQ, I am 
more.  </P>
<P>Fare thee well,</P>
