<P>That's right the psycho's writing again, I did have writers block but now I think I've found the solution to it, and I think I've become a manic depressive, as in I've suddenly got this burst of energy for writing.
<P>
<P>
<P>Everyone was thrown back from the shock wave that resulted from Shoken's fists and Xernoss's.  Again Shoken tried to strike Xernoss, only to have his fist meet once again with Xernoss's own fist.  At this Xernoss simply smiled, he hadn't had a good challenge for a long while, and he was going to make sure that these two where thoroughly crushed.
<P>
<P>"We said evacuate now!!!"
<P>
<P>"We're not leaving!"
<P>
<P>Daxster rushed toward Xernoss, his swords drawn and ready to strike, he was going to make the man who ruined his home pay, even if it meant fighting to the last breath.  Xernoss on the other hand simply seen the ranger as a flea and with a flick of his wrist Daxster was sent flying through the air and back into a tree.
<P>
<P>"Foolish elves, they really are inferior, don't you agree bo......."
<P>
<P>Xernoss was caught off guard as a rock hard fist struck him across the jaw, causing him to take a step backward to gain his balance. He the narrowed his eyes and shot forward, landing a blow to Shoken's jaw that sent him not only skidding across the ground, but buried him in the ground in the process.
<P>
<P>- If they don't leave we can't use our full power... -
<P>
<P>- So you intend for us both to go all out to destroy Xernoss. -
<P>
<P>- That's right Ryo, we can't let him hurt our friends... -
<P>
<P>- For once I understand what you mean Shoken. -
<P>
<P>"Selena.... Daxster... Go warn Felwithe, as well as Kaladim and Ak`Anon."
<P>
<P>Azia glanced back at the two, seeing Daxster raise to his feet and then rush off towards Kaladim, and then Selena dash off towards Felwithe.  After seeing they where out of  the area she unsheathed her sword and rushed Xernoss, sending a streaking wave of mana at him.
<P>
<P>"You really are fools aren't you, you don't even know the true power those weapons possess and you try to use them on someone who does."
<P>
<P>With a wave his hand the mana wave dissipated, it was then that Rita leapt forward and lashed out at Xernoss with her rapier, to her surprise thousands of mana needles shot out of it, fully imbedding themselves into Xernoss's arm.
<P>
<P>"Well doesn't this little thing have some spunk..."
<P>
<P>Rita was slapped away, as if she where a gnat, and ended up flying backwards into Azia sending them both to the ground with a thump.  It was then that Zolf and Zinka entered the fray, first was Zolf who's staff began to greatly amplify the spell he was casting, as Zinka fell in behind him and began preparing her own spell.
<P>
<P>"Sunstrike!"
<P>
<P>Seconds later Xernoss was engulfed in a fiery mass of mana, the likes of which would even have the mighty wizard Al'Kabor speechless with awe.  However, Xernoss simply walked out of the flames, his armor not even charred or marked in the least.  Zinka's staff as well had ampilied her spell greatly, this one attacked Xernoss's very mind, causing him to clutch his head in pain, or was it real pain?
<P>
<P>"Nice try you two..."
<P>
<P>Xernoss, with a sinister smile on his face thrust his hands forward, a burst of black mana suddenly erupted from them, sending Zolf and Zinka flying backwards past Azia and landing on the forest floor with a dull thump.  It was then that Shoken had managed to pull himself from the ground, his eyes where narrowed on Xernoss, the eyes which shifted to crimson blood red, a split second later his hair turned charcoal black.
<P>
<P>"Ready for some more I see, well come and meet your death!"
<P>
<P>"Your going to pay for this, I swear it Xernoss."
<P>
<P>Both Shoken's and Ryo's voices hung in the air like a thick mist, and then they bolted forward, the attack was on and once again Xernoss was meeting each attack blow for blow. The resulting shock waves made the ground tremor as if it where going to burst open any second.
<P>
<P>Selena ran as fast as her feet could carry her, she didn't even stop to speak to the guards as she rushed into Felwithe and straight for the castle, she could feel the air moving even here from the fight.  What she felt scared her more than anything she could of ever faced in Castle Mistmoore. It was this fear that gave her the power to rush through the King's personal guards and into his thrown room, where both he and Shoken's father had been talking.
<P>
<P>"We're got to evacuate now!"
<P>
<P>"Now hold on, what's the meaning of this?!"
<P>
<P>"King she's right... We should leave, evacuate to North Karana where we can take refuge in Qeynos."
<P>
<P>The King was puzzled, but he knew that Shoken's Father knew what he was talking about.  It was at this time the old man handed a message to Selena, and then amazingly enough he translocated her directly to the King's room in Ak'Anon.  She couldn't believe she was there at first, that is until she heard the clanking of gnomes tinkering around her.
<P>
<P>"I have a message for you from Felwithe..."
<P>
<P>The Gnome King took the message and read it, he then sighed and called for the local wizards, it was just as he feared, they where going to have to evacuate the continent.  It didn't take long for all the gnomes to gather outside of Ak'Anon, the king had called for every single Wizard in the area for this spell to be cast.  Mana filled the air as the wizards chanted the spell and then they where gone...
<P>
<P>Meanwhile Daxster was having a hard time convincing the dwarves to evacuate the continent, they where as stubborn as they where short, but once he described Shoken's Father to them they instantly began preparing the ships at the docks, they where going to evacuate to Freeport by boat, and at there insistence Daxster went with them...
<P>
<P>Shoken's Father stood in the center of Felwithe, raising his hands into the air as streams of mana began to flow around him, it was time he showed off just how powerful he still was, slowly one by one the elves began to fade from view as soon he himself faded from view, whispering.
<P>
<P>"Son I wish you the best..."
<P>
<P>However his son wasn't having the best time in the world, he was being flung left and right as his guard was beginning to slip, Xernoss landed blow after bone shattering blow to Shoken, sending him crashing through several trees.  Still Azia and the others hadn't left, they insisted on trying whatever the could to help him.
<P>
<P>"Boy after I'm done with you I'm going to have fun with those two women there... Yes I'll chain one on either side of my bed... They'll make lovely distractions for awhile."
<P>
<P>Something inside of Shoken snapped, as well as within Ryo, they both had now been pushed past their limits as the muscles in the body they both shared began to expand, their body was beginning to fill with power, unbelievable power.
<P>
<P>"Leave them out of this you bastard!!!"
<P>
<P>Shoken and Ryo both let out an unearthly scream of rage, energy surged up around their body as the ground beneath their feet split open, the ancient weapons seemed to react to this, finally as the ground did split open a shimmering gem encrusted hilt raised up from the depths of the earth, the blade was a majestic shimmering diamond blade.  Instantly Shoken and Ryo reached out for the weapon, grasping the hilt in their hand.
<P>
<P>- Thy'ne name is Exodus... Thou'st bloodline is now mine master... -
<P>
<P>"Well it seems as if you've attained the final weapon, but even that won't save you from my power!"
<P>
<P>The two, both acting as one rushed forward aimed the sword for Xernoss's head, only to have it blocked by Xernoss's armor covered forearm, again and again they lashed out, the blade striking Xernoss's armor again and again, and then the worst possible thing happened, the diamond blade shattered, the hilt the only part remaining unbroken and intact.
<P>
<P>"See, your fate has been sealed by those being you call gods."
<P>
<P>"It's still not over yet!"
<P>
<P>Xernoss thumbed the amulet around his neck, and smiled. Then he moved forward, his actions untraceable by Shoken's eyes, but the blows where definitely felt none the less.  Punch after deadly punch landed across Shoken's jaw, and across his ribs.  All Ryo and Shoken could do was hope for a miracle as they fell backwards, blood running from the corner of their mouth. In the process the hilt skidded across the ground and touched Azia's hand.
<P>
<P>- Shoken, we can't beat him.... -
<P>
<P>- Ryo we can't give up, we have to give them time to escape. -
<P>
<P>"Come on... We're not done yet...."
<P>
<P>Slowly they got to their feet, as they did so a gush of blood poured from their mouth as they coughed,  some how this was ironic, for all the power they both had they still couldn't beat Xernoss.  The others began to slowly stir, Zolf standing up with the help of his staff, soon to be followed by Zinka.
<P>
<P>"Zolf hurry.... Get them to safety..."
<P>
<P>"All right..."
<P>
<P>Some how Zolf knew something he'd never forget would happen, right now he had to concentrate on the matter at hand, which was getting his friends to safety.
<P>
<P>Slowly Azia and Rita began to stir, both of them opening their eyes and watching on as first Shoken, then Ryo's features would appear for a few moments then switch back again.  Azia ached all over, she felt as if her entire body had been beaten. Rita slowly raised her hand and rubbed the bandage around her head, she was so tired now, but she knew she had to repay Ryo for what he did earlier.
<P>
<P>"Azia I'm sorry for all that I've said and done to you..."
<P>
<P>"Rita take care of yourself, and I'm sorry for being so harsh on everyone..."
<P>
<P>They smiled at Azia and Rita for a brief moment, Azia couldn't believe what she heard, she had actually heard Shoken apologize to her, and not only that but she had also heard Ryo apologize as well.  She was in to much pain to be dreaming so it must be true...
<P>
<P>"I see you've said your good byes, looks like you've accepted that your going to die."
<P>
<P>"If we're going to die then we're going to make sure to take you along with us."
<P>
<P>Xernoss laughed and stood there, motioning Shoken and Ryo to attack him, but he never expected what they did next which was vanish from his sight completely.
<P>
<P>"Where have they gotten too..."
<P>
<P>"Right here you bastard..."
<P>
<P>Out of the shadows behind Xernoss they leapt out, catching him in a bear hug. It was then that Azia and Rita realized just what they where going to try as massive streams of energy seemed to flow out of the air and into Shoken and Ryo.
<P>
<P>"What the hell are you doing?!"
<P>
<P>"Like we said we're going to make sure you die with us!"
<P>
<P>Soon the streams of energy began to turn into bolts of electricity, and finally the ground began to shack as an earthquake set on.  For all that Xernoss tried he couldn't break free of their hold on him, they had their arms locked tightly around him, practically crushing his armor in the process. For a second Shoken smiled over at Azia, as did Ryo who gave a quick smile over at Rita, then the two mouthed the words "I love you", just as Zolf had began casting his teleportation spell.
<P>
<P>Azia and Rita both broke out into tears as they watched Xernoss and the two raise into the air, moments later they heard the two shout out.
<P>
<P>"LUMINAIRE!!!!!!!"
<P>
<P>The forest filled with light as the mass of energy they had gathered was released in one final attack, and with that their body was burned away by the onslaught of energy, this was the last thing Azia and Rita seen as Xernoss's scream of pain filled their ears, and then they faded away, just as Xernoss fell to the ground, but he wasn't dead, but he was wounded.  His breastplate had been melted away, and his skin had been charred.
<P>
<P>"Impossible...."
<P>
<P>Xernoss's skin smoldered as he slipped into the shadows, in his rush to leave he hadn't noticed that the amulet around his neck had formed a small hairline crack in it, however someone else noticed this.....
<P>
<P>Zebuxoruk lowered his head in grief over what he had caused, it was his fault that his chosen had died, but in giving their lives they had given him a small amount of his powers back, perhaps now he stood a chance of defeating Xernoss, or at least in assisting in his defeat.
<P>
<P>In the meanwhile Azia and Rita sat at the spires located in North Karana, and before the refugees from Faydwer they sobbed.  Azia cried because she regretted being so cruel to Shoken, she never realized just how deeply she felt about him until it was to late.  Rita on the other hand cried because for once she found someone who despite their dark persona had actually cared for her.
<P>
<P>Soon enough Selena came rushing through the crowd, and instinctively began looking for Shoken or Ryo, then she heard Azia and Rita sobbing.
<P>
<P>"Where is..."
<P>
<P>"Dear they didn't make it..."
<P>
<P>"They sacrificed themselves to stop Xernoss..."
<P>
<P>Azia simply continued to sob, in her hands she clutched the hilt of the broken Exodus, and both she and Rita heard its presence in their minds.
<P>
<P>- Thy'ne ladies do nay cry... 'Twas a noble thing thou true loves have done, but thy'ne true threat Xernoss is nay defeated, the scound is alive, and will return.  'Tis best ye' all prepare.... -
<P>
<P>Well folks this most certainly is not the end of the story, not by a long shot.  What will become of our remaining hero's and what does fate have in store for the refugee's from Faydwer... All will be revealed soon I assure you.  Okay enough with the blabbering, hey insanity does have its way of developing a good story, and don't worry, the gods work in mysterious ways.....
