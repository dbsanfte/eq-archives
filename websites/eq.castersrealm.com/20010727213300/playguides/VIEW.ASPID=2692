  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>At level 25 I finished creating a full suit of Lambent armor! Am I a twink? Hardly! I made ever piece myself with my bard and I expect it will last me well into my 30's! <p>
How did I do it? It's time consuming and a little dangerous, but it is doable if you play your cards right. <p>
At level 19, you get one of your most useful songs, Shauri's Sonorous Clouding. Say what you will, it is this little ditty that will enable you to get most of the quest items for your armor. This invisibility works well on all live MOBs. I have run throughout Cazic Thule to 4c without being seen once while this song was playing. <p>
We will discuss the quest items in a moment. First, let me say that getting the armor is not cheap. It will cost you a lot to buy the gems needed to make them, although not as much as if you bought the finished armor itself. However, I will tell you how to defray the cost as you quest for the items. You will need 4 sapphires, 2 rubies, 4 star rubies, and 6 Fire opals (4 if you only want one bracer, I made two). This will cost you about 100 pp per stone average. The rubies and sapphires are quite expensive while the fire opals are not so bad. <p>
The second problem is the Lambent stones. They are Lore so you can only hold one at a time. You need one for each piece of armor (8 total, again 7 if you want only one bracer). If you are guilded, and it helps, have your guild members grab them up when they hear the auctions. Expect to pay about 20 pp per Lambent stone. If your guild mates hold them for you, you can have them on deck as you get once piece of armor at a time. If you are not guilded, it really doesn't take much effort to get the Lambent stones. Just do WTB auctions in areas like the Commons, Oasis, and Rathe Mountains. Griffons and Giants drop them, and only Bards have a decent use for them, so most high-level characters will sometimes just give them to you for free. <p>
The Lambent Helm is one of the first pieces you can start trying for, since one of the quest items drops in a mid-to-low level area. It is common knowledge that a good place to hunt in your high teens and low 20’s is the Oasis. The Orc Highway provides a never-ending stream of MOB’s that carry decent loot and get you good exp, and the Caimans and Crocodiles that come up out of the water give great exp. Hunt here from level 16 to 20 or so and keep your ears open. Now and then, a high level group will pull a Deepwater Goblin and usually will not want the Opoline Helm that they drop. This is about the only way you will get your hands on one, so just be patient and stick it out and make sure that any campers know your intentions and needs. Once you have it, you will need to wait until you are about level 20 before you get the second item, the Mudwater Rune off the Lizard Fanatics in Cazic Thule. Like I said above, your invis song will keep you safe while you make your way to 4c. Get a map of the area, as a nasty and confusing maze stands between you and your goal. Once you make it to 4c, tell the group there (and there is always a group there) that you need the rune. It drops frequently and they will let you take it.<p>
The Lambent Bracers are pretty easy to make and carry a great +5 strength stat increase. You need a Dark Boned Bracer from the Greater Dark Boned Skeletons in The Estate of Unrest as well as a Griffienne charm from the Griffiennes in North Karanas. The Griffienne charm is easy. Many Druids hunt them in the Karanas and most will let you loot without any hassle since they are NODROP. If you cannot find anyone hunting, a small group of early 20’s should be able to take them down. Just watch out, they hit very hard!<p>
The GDB Bracer is a bit tougher, though. The Greater Dark Bones spawn in the basement of Unrest and keep very scary company in Warebats and (shudder) Festering Hags, any of which can kill you in short order. The best thing to do is get in a fountain or back room group of low to mid 20’s folks and wait for high level characters to break the basement for you. Once they do that, pay attention to the spawns at the bottom of the basement stairs. The GDB’s will often spawn here with one other MOB – usually a Skeletal Monk, Barbed Bone, or Warebat. If a Festering Hag spawns here, forget about it until someone else takes her out. She WILL kill you if you try to pull her. Assuming she does not, use Kelin’s Lugubrious Lament to sadden one mob and pull the GDB. This will be a tough one to beat, so make sure your party knows he is coming. It may take a few tries, but you will get what you need.<p>
The quest items for the Lambent Boots and Vambraces can be gotten in tandem. For the boots, you need Firewalker Boots from a Solusek Mage in Sol A and the Rune of the One Eye (middle) from Froon in West Karana. The Vambraces require the Fiery Vambraces from the Solusek Champion in Sol A and the top portion of the Rune of the One Eye from Choon in West Karanas. See the parallel here?<p>
First hang out a while in West Karanas. Hunt Gorge Hounds with a partner while you wait. Inevitably, Choon and Froon will fall as they are popular monsters to camp. Anyone who kills them will usually either destroy the runes they drop, or leave them on the bodies. A quick, courteous tell to the campers will usually be all you need to do to get the go-ahead to loot them when they drop.<p>
The Fiery Vambraces and Firewalker Boots are a trifle harder. You will need a full group of mid to high 20’s in Sol A to get to them. Clear the bar first and then work your way to the King room. The Champions and Mages spawn outside the King’s room and are kind of tricky to beat. It helps to have a healer aboard. If you don’t want to risk it, you can hang by the entrance playing your invisibility song and asking other groups if they will let you loot the items when they drop. Again, since they are NODROP and not all that useful to anyone else, it’s usually not a problem. When the tell comes in that the items have dropped run invisible to the King’s area and grab them. Be careful, some of the caster goblins may see through your spell and it will cause a major (and often fatal) train.<p>
The last three pieces, the Lambent Breastplate, Lambent Gauntlets, and Lambent Greaves, all require one item each from Lower Guk. Two will be easy to get and one will be quite difficult. If you have not killed any Froglocks in Antonica before, your faction with the residents of Upper Guk will be good enough to travel trough safely. I still suggest you use your invisibility song, just in case. I have been aggroed in there for no reason in the past and it has meant my death. Once you zone into the dead side of Lower Guk, wait at the safe area for the higher-level folks to pull and kill the Shin Knights and Shin Ghoul Knights. They drop the Shin Gauntlets and Shin Greaves respectively. Once again, they are NODROP items that drop frequently, so getting them will not be an issue. <P>
The hard part is getting a hold of the item you need for the Lambent Breastplate, a Basalt Carapace from the Basalt Gargoyles near the Bedroom. Your best bet is to shout asking if anyone is camping the Assassin/Supplier room or the Bedroom. If you get a “yes” to either, send a tell to whoever responded and ask if they are pulling the Gargoyles. If they are, ask if you can hang out with them until one drops. They usually won’t mind if you stay out of the way. Since you will be traveling among undead Froglocks, your invisibility song is useless against them. Ask someone at the zone to give you Invisibility to Undead and make your way to the Bedroom or Ass/Sup room. Be careful if you go to the Assassin/Supplier room, as there are live MOBs (Vampire Bats and Spiders) that will aggro you on the way there. Stay to the left and keep your distance from anything not undead. Once you are at your destination, stay in a corner and wait. Hopefully the group that is camping will be able to handle themselves. If they evacuate, however, you’d better follow them! The Bedroom area is safer, since it is a short swim to the tunnel leading to the safe area, but the Assassin/Supplier room can get you a special treat while you wait, if you are lucky – The Mask of Deception, which drops off the Assassin himself. It is Bard/Rogue only and is a common drop for that MOB. Once you get the Basalt Carapace, thank the party, beg for another Invisibility to Undead, and skedaddle out of there, watching out for trains on the way out.<p>
The second item you need for the Lambent Greaves is the Icy Greaves, which drop off the Elite Goblin Guards in Permafrost. You will need heavy-duty help here as the Elites spawn in the Goblin King’s room and they are very close to some of the tougher MOB’s in the dungeon. Send a shout asking if anyone is camping the King. Follow your standard procedure here to request permission to loot the greaves. Use your invisibility song to slip by the lower level goblins on your way to where the Elites are. Be careful because, like Sol A, sometimes casters can see through your song. Once you are in the room stay invisible until the Greaves drop, grab them, bow, and get out of there. Now you can get your Lambent Greaves.<p>
Your last stop will be the lovely Castle Mistmoore. You need two items here, for the Lambent Gauntlets you have to get the Black Silk Gloves from the Glyphed Aegis and for your Lambent Breastplate, you must obtain the Gypsy Lute from the Gypsy Musician. The Aegis spawns in the Cemetery, which a mid to high 20’s group can hold easily. Getting that item is a snap. Now you can get your Lambent Gauntlets. <p>
The Gypsies spawn in the Ballroom inside the castle, unfortunately. While your invis song should be able to get you to them, it does not help you kill them. Trying with anything less than group of mid 30’s who have fought their way into the castle to clear the outside spawn is very dangerous. There is one other hope, however. Trains from inside the castle are quite common. Sometimes you can get lucky and someone will train the Ballroom out. If you see a Gypsy holding a lute, try to isolate her and take her out with a full group. It will take a while, and you may die a few times, but hey, that’s Everquest. Believe me, when you are wearing your new Lambent Breastplate, you will find it was all worth it.<p>
Now, you are probably asking, “With all this running around questing for items, how will I afford to buy the gems?” Easy. While hunting or hanging in the higher-level areas, grab up as much of the unwanted loot as you can. You’ll find that in Cazic Thule and Lower Guk, most people don’t really want to carry around a bunch of fine steel or bronze weapons and will let you take them. Gargoyle eyes are worth 7-8 pp at the vendors. Keep all the words and pages you find. You can sell them to casters all over Norrath who need them for research. Honestly, I have never had trouble affording the gems as I needed them.<p>
That’s it! Any questions, feel free to e-mail me anytime at eqraventod@home.com. <p>
