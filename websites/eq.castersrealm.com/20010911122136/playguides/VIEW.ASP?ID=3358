<p>Shadow Knights<br>
<br>
<br>
We are the Dark Counter parts to our brothers the Paladins. We are a shift from the more defensive posture they hold. Our abilities are aimed at crippling our enemies, and bettering ourselves. In-groups, we serve as several things. We can add a reservoir of dehabilitating spells to the group pool. We reduce the mana needed to heal, because we heal ourselves at our foe's expense. We also bring with us a follower, one who serves even in death. We can also crush a foe with an invoking of our Dark god. With powers like this we
should be hailed as masters of Norrath, but we are not as of yet. Our skills in the arts of swordplay are weak in comparison to other classes. Our armor is also not as finely crafted. But a true Shadow Knight learns how to compensate and adapt to all that dare cross his path. So, I shall aid you in the ways of Darkness, so that you may spread the seeds of evil throughout Norrath.<br>
<br>
Picking the right race<br>
<br>
It all comes down to how you want play. Generally, the 2 more popular choices for a Shadow Knight are an Iksar and an Erudite. These 2 are picked because of various abilities and easy starting zones. Iksar have a natural AC boost and the ability to regain health at a fast rate. Erudite's have the best starting intelligence, which is essential for their utility spells and one of (if not the) best starting areas in the game. Erudite SK can easily solo to
level 9(10 is possible, but it is better to move on after 9) in Paineel and Toxxulia. They also have a chance to raise decent starting money because of they high amount of Necromancers passing through looking for bone chips.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
Armoring up for combat<br>
<br>
This is a tricky area because of the vast differences in armor that can be worn, of the SK capable races. From a broad standpoint, start with leather and banded. Start upgrading to higher level equipment when possible. Darkforge is a great choice, and you can generally get a good deal on it nowadays. If you're an erudite upgrade to flayed skin, it offers fantastic stat bonuses and is incredibly cheap.&nbsp;
This also a good rule of thumb after 10 or so. Never buy armor that doesn't modify your stats.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Also after you get your first spell set it is a good idea to start getting items that enhance your mana supply. (Dark mail gauntlet are a good example. +50 mana. And are pretty cheap)<br>
<br>
Picking the right weapon<br>
<br>
When you start out, stick with 1h slashing weapons, that you can get with no cost such as a rusty scimitar (These are common drops of newbie
NPCs). Once you hit 6, buy a shield and start using bash. Bash is a great sub attack. It inflicts extra damage and stuns and interrupts casters. After a while (9-14 most likely), though you will most likely should switch over to a 2h slashing weapons. A Fine Steel Axe or Long Sword are good
weapons to switch over to, and they are cheap (7-10pp). But if your a good barterer or have some good friends you should purchase a Bone Bladed Claymore. This is a fantastic weapon.<br>
<br>
A general idea after switching over to 2h slashing weapons, is always go for the most damage but try not to exceed 45 delay. After this your swings will just take too long to be efficient. Also a good idea is to again buy
weapons with a stat modifier or an effect. A Dark Reaver is a good example and a Lamentation blade is also a good example.<br>
<br>
Also smaller addition to your armory should be a bow. A bow is a great damage dealer and a good way to kill NPC's that are running away. Though you will generally stop using your bow much after your first spell set.<br>
<br>
<br>
Into the Fray<br>
<br>
(I am going to start out at nine because there really isn't any planning or tactics, to do before you get your spells and pet)<br>
<br>
Ok. You just reached level 9 and your first set of spells. Your first set of spells is a game changer. You can now drain life and strength from you enemies and add it to your own. You have your first Damage over time spell, which is a great spell in a duel, but
I'll explain that later on. You can invis to undead, locate your corpse and others, and you can find undead. Though
most dramatic change is you also have your first pet. If you're used to playing another pet class or have seen posts saying how over powered pets are. Stop right here, SK pets are weak and are not meant to take a lot of damage. Now you might think what is the point then? The pets are simply meant to augment our total Damage output and to use to taunt an NPC off us. Now in there own right
once you have gotten used to controlling your pet, you will see it as a huge asset. Also you must now learn how to cast spells between sword swings, simply wait until you see your sword animation swing, then hit the spell gem.<br>
<br>
Also on the subject of pets: You must learn to arm your pets well. Never ever armor pet with a one hand slashing weapon unless it procs an effect (such as a Rune sword or a Gnoll hide Lariat). You don't equip a pet with these
weapons because they add minimal damage output to your pet. Always add a 2h-slashing weapon to your pet, the damage bonus
is huge. Now going back to the exception, pets just like all NPC's are not effected by level requirements to use an effect on a weapon. So if you
equip your pet with a Gnoll hide lariat (Effect stun), your pet will Proc the effect several times during a fight. This is an extremely valuable asset to a fight, especially if you can get some one to summon a Rune sword which procs a 41 DD spell, which turns your little munchkin into a Walking Death Machine.<br>
<br>
Level 15. This is another major change; this will turn you into a great choice for groups in pulling and killing. Your clinging darkness is not only a DOT (Damage over time) spell but it slows your target Down and stops them when they get low on health. This is also a time when many say (and you can, but I don't recommend it), that you can start soloing using fear kiting. (Cast Fear, sic pet, Cast Darkness, Spike it a few times, charge it and kill it) I don't recommend Kiting because of two reasons,&nbsp;<br>
<br>
1. Your downtime will be tremendous, where as in a group/partner situation you would be back up in a min or two.<br>
2. Fear kiting in some areas, has a tendency to go wrong. Your one little orc might come back with a few (hundred) friends who want to beat you into the ground.<br>
<br>
Another major change is you have gotten Shadow Step, your next game changing ability. This spell is a random in zone teleport, generally anywhere from 1-100 feet on any axis (though you will only go upward if you are standing near a hill, but this is rare). This allows you to get some escape room on an NPC. In a duel this skill is priceless, PC's can't auto track you like NPC's, giving you more then enough time to deal out some damage.<br>
<br>
After this there aren't really any more vast play changing skills with the exception of the following<br>
<br>
Parry<br>
Dodge<br>
And most importantly, Feign Death. A skill which allows you to make an NPC think that you are dead and leave you alone.<br>
<br>
Dueling<br>
<br>
This isn't a major thing in the game but still it is where many of our skills shine. Always maximize your time to unleash hell upon your enemy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Shadow step: Moves you away from the opponent, and since they can't auto track you, confuses them. Allows you to get off some more spikes or DOT's<br>
<br>
Fear: Fear makes them run for the hills. When they are feared your DOT's will do full damage. A perfect time to refresh your DOT's on an opponent. Also a prime time to
send in your pet.<br>
<br>
Darkness: It does damage and it slows your opponent down dramatically<br>
<br>
Siphon Strength: If your opponent is already close to/or is encumbered this further reduces their speed.<br>
<br>
LifeSpike: Always keep spiking your opponent the more health you have and the less they have the better.<br>
<br>
Disease: Disease is great spell. It does pretty good damage, but it takes a long time to do it.
The real beauty of it, is that it interrupts healing. So this spell is a murder to races like iksar that rely on their fast hp regen.<br>
<br>
Pet: Never let your pet go against your opponent alone, try to keep your opponent guessing on what to do. The more time he/she wastes the closer you are to victory.<br>
<br>
Sidestepping: To do this either uses the control key and the arrow keys to strafe around your opponent, keeping your self out of there damage radius and keep yours on them. It also improves your chances of connecting, since it is hard for them to dodge something they
can't see coming&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Our trump card, Harm touch:&nbsp; It deals massive damage all at once never be afraid to use it. But never open with it. You might not need to use it, or (especially if you're fighting a pally) they might be waiting on it to heal up leaving you with some more work to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Grouping and how to maximize your efficiency<br>
<br>
Grouping is the way to go, low downtime and you can kill a lot more. Plus, it is not as boring as soloing. (Though, I do love the days when I can just go to
a camp and slaughter them all. So should you, we are evil) To maximize your total output and be a great asset to your group, you must know how to pull and keep Mobs from going haywire on your casters. First off always lead with a good taunt spell (Disease at
level 9, Darkness at 15 to give your group mates a few extra seconds to get ready), to make the Mob hate you above all else. Now if you are unlucky enough to pull multiple
Mobs, disease them and keep on chopping them down, and using your Life Spike and darkness in-between melee rounds. Also keep your pet set not to taunt, like I have said before, our pets cannot take much so you don't want them getting beat on. Now one last grouping note, many a friend and ally have been made with a well placed Harm Touch. It is the best way to pull something off a weakened group mate, it is an uber taunt attack and nothing
won't agro on you after getting hit by this, if they haven't died (If you got blasted for an obscene amount of damage wouldn't you be a little mad?)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
So, now I leave you my Dark Brethren. Practice and hone your skills so that all quake before you.<br>
