  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>Congratulations,
     If you have reached the level of 40 with your ranger, you obviously are either a:  a devoted player, who doesn't mind the fact that many of the "ranger of yore"s abilities are scoffed at by Verant (tracking, archery), or b: you are a twinkie who was shamelessly leveled through some of the hardest levels a ranger can deal with (30-40).  If you are a twinkie, please disregard this strategy as you will have your high level friends twink you to stardom..this post isn't for you :)<P>

If you are one of the few devoted non-twinked rangers...and truly want to know your role in the last portion of ranger's "lull period", then please read on.<P>

Rangers are a fine, slightly over-balanced melee class, who can use sword and spell to smite our opponents.  However, do not expect that the combination of both will outdamage the pure melee classes until you get call of flames,(or a caster EVER hehe) because it won't.  However, if used correctly, with the right equipment, rangers can be a highly sought after class for a light tank role, with our HUGE "train stopping" and "peeling" abilities, as well as our "new spawn meter" that Verant calls tracking.<P>

What a ranger is from 40-50...how you measure up<P>

Why play your ranger?  How do you measure up at high levels?  What is your "place"?  Here are a few charts that show where rangers fit in the hybrid/melee scheme of things from 40-50.<P>

Equipment choices, and getting around our weaknesses
<P>
By using the correct equipment (at any level), Rangers can minimize thier inherent weakness of not being able to wear plate-class armor.  I will say now that MELEE STAT BOOSTING ARMOR is only an option IF THAT ARMOR IS ONLY ONE AC LESS than the highest possible ac alternative.  Yes, you simply would not believe the actual log parsed differences between 802 ac and 822.  AC is the only stat that is worth boosting "all or nothing".  Treat AC as the equivalent stat to INT or WIS for a caster/priest.  If you do you will never go back :).  A few examples are IVY OVER ANYTHING ELSE until THORNY VINE. (Hammerhead helm is the exception to this rule...when you get it USE IT forever unless you are half elf and need the wis for call of flame).  NEVER EVER EVER equip enchanter-made jewelry OTHER THAN AC BOOSTING pieces.  Best earrings before diamondine/electrum black sapphire are GOLD TOPAZ...YES the 3 ac +8 disease ones.  Best neck is Polished mithril torque over runed lava pendant and MUCH MUCH over the golden black pearl choker..its garbage.  Rings should always add ac as well..jagged bands until you can afford platinum fire opal rings, and later on silver jacinth vs non magic using opponents.  TRULY ac is king, and if you boost it in any way possible you will see a dramatic increase in overall effectiveness.  I went from 172 str, 155 dex 180 agil 102 sta (self buffed) to 149 str, 134 dex, 160 agil, 117 sta and increased my ac by 30.  HUGE DIFFERENCE...
<P>
AC IS KING...all your equipment pieces should reflect that.  If it does, well...congrats you can probably tank better than Joe-Blow paladin who is still using "garbage jewelry", aka plat fire emerald rings, golden bp choker...AND you can outdamage that same paladin STILL 3 fold.
<P>
Dual wield owns 2handed weapons...ESPECIALLY if you use FAST WEAPONS late in life.  SPEED IS EVERYTHING as a ranger.  The faster our weapons are, the more damage we tend to deal on the whole.  Damage shields inhibit this all the time (ever wonder why so many mobs have them?), so always ALWAYS carry an egg shaped pumice stone or 6 with you to dispel them in an emergency (cancel magic is way to slow).  Using fast weapons (25 or less speed) will increase your damage output by a LOT 40+, since rangers have dual wield and double attack...they will come into play more..the faster the weapon.  Also, there is a minimum and average damage cap that goes up with level, and truly ...If I hit you for 12 10 times in the time it takes you to hit me for 18 5 times who wins?  Also, rangers get more CONSISTANT damage over time the faster the weapons, misses just don't matter as much :)  EQLIZER RATIOS SUCK.  Don't believe them at all.  THE BEST non god/dragon weapon you could ever wield is the Revultant whip from the Rats in Hate.  Its even better than the Mistwalker in the primary hand!  SICK!  WRONG!  SPEED OWNS!  Get those wakizashis out..they OWN Ykeshas.  YES the Ykesha is inferior in every way to the Wakizashi...they are warrior weapons not ranger blades.  The taunt factor alone on the unpredictable proc is enough to not use them unless soloing (yet you will STILL do more damage net with Wakizashis..I GUARANTEE THIS..as a ranger they kick the snot out of Ykeshas every time).  The ONLY WAY that a ykesha IN PRIMARY HAND is IF you have enough dexterity to proc 8!!! times in a 5 minute fight.  THEN AND ONLY THEN will that ykesha MATCH the Wakizashi for damage..just MATCH it...9procs over 5.2 minutes will outdamage the Wak every time tho.  If you can get 9 procs out of anything you are a god, so do yourself a favor and use that Wakizashi until you get a flux axe/Revultant whip.  Or dream of the day when you have the SDClaws/Briarzephyr combo.<P>
<P>

Rangers are a melee class with few hp and lower possible armor class than all other melee classes other than the rogue.  Rangers have an EXTREMELY HIGH taunt factor due to our fast weapons dealing mad damage..and striking the foe quickly... so much in fact that many of us dont have taunt hotkeyed in our primary 6 simply because unless we are "peeling" (see below under "what we do well"), taunting the mob will almost certainly pull the mob off the real tank in the group FOR GOOD.  Don't taunt UNLESS we are the PRIMARY TANK in a group.  Keep it handy though in case a caster gets frenzy of the mob..or your main tank is a hurtin. <P>
<P>
What we do well<P>
<P>
Rangers are the undoubted MASTERS of Peeling, the art of taking a frenzied mob OFF of a vulnerable target (enchanter who has a charmed mob break free, Cleric casting heals, Over-zealous Nukers, hell anything that attacks the ENCHANTER..can't mem blur everything :)  If you are in a 40+ group you should take it upon yourself to do up to 3 things every fight.  These are SNARE EVERY TARGET (yes, snare does NOT NOT NOT break MES-ENTHRALL etc,), ASSIST your main tank, and (ONLY if you do NOT have an enchanter with) attack ALL mobs that FRENZY on non tank members of the party.  USE SNARE RIGHT AWAY as most of the time, your enchanter will be trying to Mesmerize the adds on each and every pull, and that snare HELPS to keep the mob pissed at YOU, not HIM.  If the enchanter dies your whole party will almost surely perish on a larger pull, if you die..well..then the enchanter has enough time to stun/mes and get that pull under control.  If you die for your party (you will a lot), they will come to respect you even more. If for some reason a mezzed mob breaks free and is POUNDING the enchanter, attack it and WATCH FOR THE "mr.enchanter begins to cast a spell" message and TURN OFF AUTO ATTACK, while KEEPING THE TAUNT BUTTON MASHED.  ONE HIT from your sword after the mez hits and the spell the enchanter just cast is wasted.  However, with practice you can ALWAYS taunt the mobs off the enchanter, get a few hits in with fast weapons, and QUIT attacking the mob before the mez hits it.  We are rangers..and as we are the UNDENIABLY BEST at this job, we HAVE to be able to use this strat ALL THE TIME EVERY TIME.  Making enchanter friends is key to making sure you can find a group. Many don't realize that rangers simply rule at keeping enchanters alive, the more you can educate to this fact the easier it will be finding groups in Kunark and beyond.  This skill will be sought after by every enchanter you ever use this strategy with.<P>
<P>
The "New Spawn Meter" known as tracking to Verant<P>
<P>
Well, rangers HAD tracking from levels 1-20 :)  I loved it for soloing those wasps!  But as any higher level ranger knows....tracking is only useful really in 2 zones...plane of fear and plane of hate for pulling.  The rest of the time it is your group's "rare spawn meter".  Yes you can tell when that Mino Elder spawns when your group sits at the lord room!  You can find out when Slaythe the Slayer is up at the KING ROOM....too bad you can't see anything that has been around for more than 2 seconds...but use it to your advantage..if you are pulling like 6 rooms with a high powered group..then it could help someone you know get something they needed for a long time.<P>
<P>

Rangers use of spells<P>
<P>
Rangers get some crap spells and some good ones.  Most are utility based, with some limited after-fight healing :)  Our stat buffs are nice in the fact that they give us a lil bit more for stats all the time...they never drop off our chars...so we can have more room for AC AC AC.  Personal skin buffs are wonderful for that ac upgrade.  Skin like steel is well...pretty useless unless soloing, Even Bravery from your paladin buddy owns it.  And Sow is always nice for getting you and your party from the port in spot to the location of the hunt (as well as making travel safer, and making a newbie smile).  However, those spells are really "it" for all the time buffs.<P>
That brings us to the combat spells.  There are only 3 spells you will cast at least once every combat round.  These are shield of Brambles (on yourself or your group..cuz no druid/magician I know keeps it up all the time), snare, and Call of Flame once you get it.  Stinging swarm is overwritten by many dots in the game..not just from druids..so I hardly ever use it at all..only real use is solo (where it does help).  Careless Lightning is ONLY USEFUL when you are solo trying to get a smidge of xp per solo kill of a gator every 10 minutes :)  If you manadump YES you will deal a little more damage quickly...it could save your life..but alternately..if you are interrupted you are missing VERY VALUABLE melee time...and truly I deal INSANELY more damage with melee in the 2.7 seconds it takes to cast Careless lightning, and I have mana to heal myself or manastone users after the fight.  We all know we have a gift and it is called snare.  Use it all the time every time, and 2x on Sundays :)  This is our greatest spell...every time you come across a mob if it isnt snared either A: you have a necro along casting darkness for damage or B: you arent doing your job.  Finally...Call of Flame is the ONLY true damage combat spell rangers get that is of any real use in any situation.  206 dd, 2.0 cast time, 18 second recast, 125 mana.  This spell does more damage than my weapons do now....unlike every other spell at my disposal.  Truly a great addition to our offense..this is our "flying kick that costs mana"... our "backstab that costs mana"...the thing that makes us a damage dealing tank.  Get it.  Cry about losing your wakizashi, and get another one.  ENJOY dealing damage in the planes finally (or again if you had a mistwalker pre nerfwalker).  Can't say enough about this spell...I can solo bouncers without kiting..this is a must have spell..and with it at level 50 in full planar armor focusing on ac....you can literally solo dars in guk.  IMPOSSIBLE pre CoF...I know I tried.  Must have spell...make it your life goal...it will still be the best spell rangers have in Kunark..as all the other nukes take way too long to cast for minimal damage upgrade.<P>
<P>
Hunting to reach 50 from 40...<P>
<P>
Now that you know what your role is..well you say "wheres the xp jack?"  The places you will net the best xp ever are Seafury rehab in OOT, (excellent if raiding the planes/dragons has reduced your full bar 50 to level 46 :) Lower guk frenzy/lord/magi/king/noble rooms, Kedge Keep (simply amazing xp anywhere) and SolB (anywhere is fine :)  You will probably be able to solo a few gks at the zone if you can pull them solo at level 45..maybe earlier but 45 is when I started when I was bored and wanted to blast thru hell with Celt :)  Truly solo should only be a last ditch effort..rangers are a grouping class..they should never solo unless absolutely necessary.  Don't underestimate Kedge Keep for xp.  You are the catalyst there...you can cast breath, invigor, invis (at 49 :P)...keeping your grp running at top efficciency.  Those mobs are WONDERFUL xp..better than anything out there because kedge is a HARD zone...the more you fight there the quicker your xp bar goes up :)  GROUPING will always give rangers more xp in the same amount of time..especially if you have an enchanter with you.  Rangers should seek enchanters all the time...they are your best match for any group...my 50 ranger and my 50 enchanter friend and I can duo any room in solb for a short time if not trained..and add a 50 cleric and we are an xp machine.  This trio also nets excellent xp in oot..but remember if you DONT boost ac this wont work at all.  If you are level 40 and dont have over 800 ac this stuff wont do anything except make you upset and think that I am a liar :)  GET YOUR AC UP even if it means having base stats again :)  Truly stats won't matter in the long run..and besides...when your 40+ you have shamen with you almost all the time since they are such a strong solo class..there are 2823 of them runnin round with the druids/necros hehe :)  Be proud..as a non twink ranger you have fought long and hard to this time in your life....if you can work with an enchanter your xp will come very fast..and soon you can be ready for when I think rangers will truly shine...in Kunark :)
