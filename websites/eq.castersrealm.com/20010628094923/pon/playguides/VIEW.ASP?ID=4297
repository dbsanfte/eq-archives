Norrath!<br>
<br>
Author&#146;s note: What I am writing is my own opinion, it&#146;s
not gospel, so don&#146;t e-mail me saying my opinion on this,
that and the other is wrong, OK? Good J However, you CAN E-Mail
me if I got technical details wrong or those technical details
have been upgraded. Now on with the show!<br>
<br>
<br>
Welcome one and all! Put your sword and shield down, I have some
explaining to do. I will tell you young Elven Paladins how to
succeed in the Greater Faydark, but be warned! It will not be
easy!<br>
<br>
<br>
Getting Started:<br>
<br>
Welcome to Felwithe, the great Marble Palace, easily the finest
in Norrath! Now, young Paladin, you must commit yourself to the
ideals of Tunare. Take your sword and place it in your hand.
Destroy your Tome of Order and Discord. I will not tolerate
Children of Discord in my family! Find Tynkal in the Guild house
directly across from the Bridge, guarded by your courageous
elders. Give Tynkal, the greatest Paladin in Norrath, your Guild
note and he will hand you a training robe. Should you see fit to
wear this, then do so or sell it to your friendly vendors for
some silver coins. Inspect Tynkal and he will offer you the
choice to train your skills. Choose 1H Slashing and train all 5
points in this category. Now be gone and earn the respect Tunare
has entrusted in you.<br>
<br>
Embark into the Greater Faydark and find a small vermin and
cleanse it. Try to focus on Bats, Decaying Skeletons, Black
Wolves, Orc Pawns and Widow Hatchlings. Stacks of Bat Wings and
Bone Chips can be sold to players for at least 2 Platinum coins
per stack. Save all your grey wolf skins (High, Medium, Low and
Ruined quality). You&#146;ll need these for making your patchwork
armour and Spider-ling silks can be combined in a sewing kit for
free advancement in Tailoring (you can&#146;t fail making silk
threads, plus they stack whereas spider-ling silks don&#146;t.
Once you come across a Cracked Staff, Rusty Bastard Sword, Rusty
2Handed Sword and a Worn Great Staff, save these for you shall
need them to advance your weapon skills until you can buy better.
These can be found on Decaying Skeletons and Orcs. There have
been myths about a mysterious Lance type weapon. I have had no
experience finding these, but if you come across one, be sure to
save it.<br>
<br>
Until Level 3, put all your points into training up 1H Slashing.
Once you hit 3, begin to encroach on 1H Blunt. You should have
acquired a Cracked Staff and some kind of better sword to
increase your skill. You shall not become a master of these
weapons until you are Level 4 at least. Upon reaching the maximum
skill in 1H Slash and 1H Blunt, begin training in 2H Slashing.
This should carry you through until Level 7.<br>
<br>
At Level 5, move onto Orc Hill (making sure to get a free bind at
Orc Lift. You&#146;re going to die a LOT!). You can either group
or solo here. Grouping has the added advantage of gaining
experience less quickly, but your weapon skills won&#146;t rise
very quickly since others will be helping you kill the mobs and
you have to share the money. I prefer to solo since your skills
in your weapon, bash (eventually), taunt, offence and defence
will rise quickly. Here&#146;s my strategy for Orc Hill. Pull
enemies to you via Archery (WHAT? You mean you haven&#146;t
bought a bow yet?) and just swing that sword! Keep on swinging
until you&#146;re almost dead and then use your Lay Hands skill
to completely heal you. Now keep on fighting. When you have one
bubble of health left, keep on fighting. Yeah, fight to the
death. You&#146;ll die and get resurrected at the Orc Lift. Grab
your corpse and keep on fighting. Doesn&#146;t matter if you die.
The only point of gaining a level is to advance your cap on your
skills, gain more hit points and get spells. That&#146;s not
really necessary until all your skills have reached a cap and,
unless you&#146;re really fragile, you&#146;ll be gaining
experience even if you die after every other Orc. Keep doing this
until you hear the fabled &#147;DING!&#148;<br>
<br>
At Level 6, put one point into Bash and Taunt. Now try and grab a
Shield (you should have lots of money from all the bats and
Decaying Skeletons you killed to get to Level 5). All Paladin
races need a Shield to Bash with. Bash will rise very slowly, but
don&#146;t worry: as it takes longer to progress through levels,
you&#146;ll have more time to raise Bash. Eventually, once you&#146;ve
capped out all 4 weapon skills (Level 8 minimum!), switch back to
a 1H Weapon and a shield to practice Bash some more.<br>
<br>
NB! Since Verant have introduced a new Paladin Melee Skill (2H
Piercing), it&#146;s going to take you even longer to cap out all
your melee skills. I would estimate around Level 12 for
perfection in all 5 for your level (65).<br>
<br>
At Level 7, you should have completed your skill cap in 1H Slash,
2H Slash and 1H Blunt. Now it&#146;s time to move onto 2H Blunt.
I recommend you spend as many training points in 2H Blunt before
you use it (at LEAST 5) and make sure you&#146;re prepared to die
a lot. Since you&#146;ll be hitting for less damage less
frequently, Orcs will hit you more and your heath will have less
chance to recover, ergo you&#146;ll die more. But this is also a
great opportunity to work on your Bind Wound skills. Keep doing
the same formula until you hit Level 8.<br>
<br>
You are now a match for any Orc! Go to Crushbone entrance in
Greater Faydark. Here 8 Orcs of varying levels (4 to 8 like at
Orc Hill) spawn and trains are rife. Here you&#146;ll get your
first taste of the chaos that can wreak havoc in Crushbone, as
you&#146;ll see characters Level 12+ wandering through with only
a sliver of life left. You can help them out and get some more
Bind Wound practice in here. After all, most of them will be your
Elven brethren! So do something about it! Keep hunting here,
picking off the higher-level Orcs until you hit Level 9 and that
always-empty bar starts to fill up with that strange blue stuff&#133;
Could it be?<br>
<br>
WELCOME TO LEVEL 9! Hello low level, redundant Cleric spells! Now
you are truly a force to be reckoned with! Go to your guild and
place 1 point into Abjuration, 1 into Alteration. For some reason
Channelling is already at a fairly high level. Sure, you get 2
divination spells, but they&#146;re near useless in combat so you
won&#146;t need them. Besides, Flash of Light is as good at
causing trains as Reverse Kiting (Necromancer&#146;s specialty)
in a dungeon. I would not recommend stepping foot in Crushbone
until Level 9 at least when your downtime will be significantly
reduced (Orcs have a tendency to wander along just when you&#146;re
low on health and are resting. ANYTHING that glares or scowls at
you, regardless of level, will attack you if you&#146;re
sitting). Use this method: Bind your wounds up to 50% then use
your best healing spell on yourself until you are out of manna.
You&#146;ll probably still be way off your full HP capacity, so
sit and rest and it will rejuvenate along with your manna. Once
you&#146;re primed for action (and have your new Buff on yourself
to raise HP and AC limits further), go and flush out a few cents
and slavers. When you come across Crushbone Belts, you can either
sell them or hand them into a Dwarf at Kaladim. Kaladim&#146;s a
pretty long run off, so better to save up a few backpacks full
before going. As a Wizard, I relied on these to get me to Level
12, but as a Paladin, I found my money supplies were plentiful
enough for me to hand these in for experience! :)<br>
<br>
You should begin spending every penny you can get on new Armour
and weapons, so selling the Belts may not be a bad idea. Try to
get some Banded Armour. Make sure to get the smallest size for
your race (Small Banded for Dwarves and High Elves, Medium Banded
for Erudites, Half Elves and Humans). You may want to skip
straight to Bronze, although the AC is better, it&#146;s bloody
heavy, crippling for High Elves! Better start saving up for Fine
Steel Plate (1AC = 20pp)! It&#146;s lighter and has much better
AC than Bronze.<br>
<br>
By Level 9, I had capped out all of the old Melee skills (1H
Bash, 2H Bash, 1H Slash and 2H Slash). Don&#146;t bother with
hand to hand because after Level 15, you&#146;ll never be unarmed
again. Thanks to the new 2H Piercing skill for Paladins, I would
have began work on it at Level 9, with about a bubble of
experience to go. I have not actually used a 2H Piercing weapon
yet, but I can estimate that I would probably have maxed out all
5 weapon skills (5? Ug&#133;) by around Level 12. Just remember
to keep an eye on the text box. I&#146;ve missed the capping out
skill point for a melee weapon lots of times. You can tell the
difference by monitoring your attack ratio (under your HP and AC
ratios in your stats section of your inventory) so use this
instead of wasting points in your guild when you don&#146;t know
what skill you are at. If you&#146;ve been fighting for 30
minutes and seen no skill improvement, switch to another weapon.
Hopefully you&#146;ll see when this weapon caps out, so then you
can compare attack ratios. If one is lower than the other, the
lower one needs more practice on those Orcs.</p>
