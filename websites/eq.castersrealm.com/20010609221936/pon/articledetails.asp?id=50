<tr> 
<td width='80%'><P align=left>As Lady Seralyn and I made our way through the 
diseased paths of Steamfont Mountains, everywhere we looked there was 
plague. Infested rats freely lunched on the corpses of our brethren, struck 
down in their youth by the Minotaur Hero of Steamfont. Seralyn's heart 
sank that she had not been here to heal those before they had fallen. As her 
avowed protector, I was grateful that she had not been exposed to the 
Hero's wrath. Thus, ever watchful, we pressed on to the center of the 
region.</P>
<P align=left>Coming over a hill, we finally beheld the site 
we desired--the magnificent Windmills of Steamfont. Ah, they were truly 
beautiful. As we looked, a lonely monk ran up, chased by two skeletons. I 
derailed them for the poor fellow and Seralyn and I made easy work out of 
the vile things. Afterwards, Seralyn took a needed rest while I nursed some 
light wounds. But our rest was not to be, for soon another hapless 
adventurer deposited two more skeletons at our feet. We defeated them, but 
not without some concern for the danger the windmills seemed to 
represent.</P>
<P align=left>Being stout disciples of Tunare, however, 
required that we heal ourselves and continue. After Seralyn awoke from her 
light meditation, we ventured into a small valley adjacent to the Windmills. 
Scurrying down the hillsides were large rabid rodents, with a puma or two 
overseeing their play. We were not interested in those creatures--we were 
pursuing the undead that the Mother so detests. Halfway up the hill, one of 
those very creatures scowled at my approach. I saw another wandering behind 
him, so I called to Seralyn to ward the creature and bring him down to us. 
With Seralyn's powerful magic, the skeleton came running to his 
death.</P>
<P align=left>I had hardly swung once at the bones when a 
puma joined the fight, attacking me on my left. Upon considering the puma, I 
determined that it was doing little damage, so, ignoring it, I concentrated 
on the skeleton. Lady Seralyn was bashing the thing with her mighty 
staff as it turned on her. I taunted the bonehead back to me--Seralyn's 
safety is always utmost on my mind.</P>
<P align=left>Suddenly, a rabid rat sought Seralyn's thigh. I 
heard her yell in pain. With renewed vigor, I pressed into the skeleton 
and slew it. Seralyn was in a death grip with the sick rat, so still 
ignoring the puma, I threw myself into the crazed rodent. It was soon dispatched. 
Finally, I turned to the puma who, along with the others had reduced my 
health by half. I quickly slew the puma, only to hear Seralyn scream 
again. I turned to see another vile undead skeleton laughing at her torment. I 
jumped in front of milady and taunted the creature away. Another of his 
bony brothers joined up on me.</P>
<P align=left>I slashed and I bashed and the creature's 
health decreased ever so slowly. I heard Seralyn scream again. A third Skeleton 
had joined the fight. Surely some evil was at work. I started to rage 
with disease. At last I slew the skeleton against me and, ignoring the 
other, turned to the creature attacking Seralyn. I quickly glanced at her. 
She was near death and in the fight of her life. I could not wait any longer. 
As I saw her body quake with the last of her mortal strength departing 
her, I felt Tunare's holy goodness flow through me as I reached out and 
brushed her arm. My Seralyn was restored! Ever brave, she shouted to me, 
"Lay hands and heal yourself, I have no mana!"</P>
<P align=left>I replied, "I am sorry milady, but I have 
already spent it on you." Feeling my own health slip to below one bubble, I 
grimly fought on. The two skeletons seemed beyond me. Seralyn threw some 
restoration into my body, but it was just a matter of time now. She 
meditated fiercely. As she regained enough mana to cast a heal, she would 
jump up and heal me, before collapsing in exhaustion again.</P>
<P align=left>I finally managed to hoarsely utter a weak 
"Help." Suddenly a blast of fire scorched one of the skeletons. A wizard! And 
then another skeleton joined the fray, but this time against his brothers! 
What curse was this? It was not a wizard who aided us but a vile 
necromancer gnome! Tunare is truly powerful to entreat a dark being to rescue her 
children.</P>
<P align=left>With waning strength, I slew the skeleton and 
turned to the sole remaining monster. As I raised my shield to bash the vile 
thing one more time, it was sent back to the grave by the distasteful 
necromancer. I finally stepped back to rest. Offering a thanks to the gnome, I 
raised my arms to cast and heal my diseased body when I heard Seralyn 
scream again.</P>
<P align=left>Another rabid rat had sunk its fangs into her 
while she was sleeping. I rushed over to finish it off, but not before it 
had reduced Seralyn's health significantly. I ordered her into the windmill, 
with all due haste. She ran for the shelter, with me hot on her 
heels. She threw open the door as another rat launched into her. I immediately 
slashed at the rodent. After a few hefts of my battle axe the thing 
finally squealed its last.</P>
<P align=left>We were safe! I glanced around the inside of 
the windmill as Seralyn fainted from exhaustion. There was a guard 
outside and there were no creatures inside; only a sole merchant gnome. 
Seralyn mumbled in her sleep, "I will cure you, milord, as soon as I 
can..."</P>
<P align=left>In the distance I heard a shout, "Mino Hero to 
town!" I glanced around nervously. Would the hero come here? I gently 
shook Seralyn awake as, closer now, we heard the shout, "Mino Hero near 
mills!"&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>I said to the Lady, "Perhaps we will be safe in 
here." I cast a heal on myself, trying to reach two bubbles of health, 
when I heard her last words:&nbsp; "I hope so milord."</P>
<P align=left>Suddenly, standing before me, was the largest 
creature I have ever seen. With one swipe of his mighty axe, my Seralyn 
was gone. Then, having utterly failed in my sacred duty, I bowed my head and 
submitted myself to the black clutches of the Minotaur Hero.</P>
