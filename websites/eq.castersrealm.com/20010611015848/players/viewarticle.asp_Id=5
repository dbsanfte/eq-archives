<p> Chapter 1 The Hell Lord Rises</p>  
<p> ----------------------</p> 

<p>Arorua woke with a start, a light flash had cut through Raziel's quarters overlooking the training ground. She settled herself back into the bed, gazing out, watching the rain fell against the barrier. It was rhythmic and she began to doze back to sleep, when she heard a clash. Grumbling to herself, cursing the heretics and their lack desire for sleep, she stumbled to the barrier. What she saw woke her up right away.</p> 

<p>"You have gotten strong Raziel, but even my best pupil can have his blood flow."<p> 

<p>Raziel winced, down on his knees. Blood leaked out of his breastplate. 

<p>"Just because I bleed old man, doesn’t mean that you are even close to victory. * In fact why don’t you shed a little of your own!"</p> 

<p>Raziel’s body faded way. Malik followed him. They faded back into view, high above the training grounds parrying sword blows. Raziel dodging several of Malik's attacks faded out again, quickly reappearing higher in the air, and released a flaming bolt from his hands. Malik did not even flinch as the bolt struck him.</p> 

<p>"You'll have to do better then a simple magician's trick!"</p> 

<p>Raziel's hands glowed brightly for an instant, then this time Malik cried out as his blood boiled. Using this moment's distraction Raziel faded away, and reappeared behind Malik, rushing his sword across Malik's back, then bashing him to the ground.</p>

<p>This was not a training session! Why are they trying to kill each other!?! Arorua was dumbstruck as they clashed with an unnatural blood lust. She could not believe that Malik, that gentle old man, who protected her from the heretics, was capable of such power and savagery. Her mind was unable to comprehend what was going on, she just watched in horror as they continued.</p> 

<p>The battle raged between them, they used every technique, every absorbed spell and incantation at their disposal. The training grounds were soon alit with flames and magical energy. Their blades screamed as they met, making an unbearable roar. They faded into the shadows repeatedly; reappearing and disappearing faster then could be seen. *(Test Your Might by Utah Sands)</p> 

<p>Raziel and Malik both exhausted from the expenditure; soon faced each other in a dead stare. Both bled heavily, they knew that this next charge, would be someone’s last. Endless seconds merged as they stared at each other, blending together for an eternity. Then they charged, their swords flew at each other, then a sound of flesh ripping. They stopped, pausing for a moment. Then Raziel fell to the ground, blood flowing freely. He breathed painfully.</p> 

<p>"It is a shame Raziel, you were my best student. Now you are just like the others. Pity. I almost hate to have to take your life and consume your soul. But that is the penalty for failure."</p> 


<p>Malik leaped high into the air. "NOW YOU DIE!!!"</p> 


<p>"Good.... Bye my teacher..."</p> 

<p>Malik began to fall to the ground, preparing to bring the deathblow. But Raziel rose to his feet and strings of mana began to flow through him.*(end Music Track)</P> 

<p>"NOOOOOOOOO!!!! DONT!!!!!!!!!!!" Arorua screamed she knew that technique, she knew what was coming.</p> 


<p>"RAAAAAAAAAGING STORM!!!!!!!!!!"</p> 


<p>The training ground exploded with blinding light and a great shock wave ripped through it. The barrier in front of Arorua exploded as the wave hit careening her against the far wall. Her world went blank.</p> 


<p>Arorua woke painfully; pieces of the shattered furnishing poked and jabbed at her. She crawled to the hole were the barrier used to be. And looked across what was left of the training grounds. Blood was splattered every where; she vomited when she saw a shredded body part underneath the hole. She tried to regain herself, but she couldn't she was in tears, she felt rage. In her life she never felt so confused or so much hatred. Why, Why this? Why kill the only person who welcomed her. Why.. Why.. She stumbled down the stairs and onto the grounds, she ran to Raziel. She hated him, She wanted make him suffer.</p> 


<p>"WHY! Why did you do this! How could you! You bast.."</b> 

<p>"Arorua stop. You have always believed in me and my faiths, do so now" His telepathic message ran through her head. "Calm down, I understand what you feel, trust me. This is for the better. Trust me and follow the elders" *(Agnus Dei)</p>


<p>She heard a solemn chant behind her, when she turned, she saw the entire residence of Paineel. All dressed in shrouds, all chanting the same sad song. One motioned her to his side and put a similar shroud over her.</p>


<p>Raziel reached up at the stars gathering mana and began an incantation "Asho!, selva!, recraeta! Necromone!" The blood and sinew that was once Malik began to fly together and reform the Hell Lord.</p>


<p>Soon the body was complete. Using his arcane magic Raziel had the body float up beside him. He joined in the chant walking towards the great Chasm, which led to Old Paineel.</p>


<p>Detaching away from the main group, Raziel and Malik's corpse floated over the Chasm. And awaited the group to assemble along the rock face.</p> 

<p>"Malik, You have served us well in your countless years. You have earned the greatest rewards that can ever be bestowed upon a mortal. And it is my honor to give them to you." spoke Raziel, just loud enough to be heard over the Chasm.</p> 

<p>"Selva, Misho, Seper, Soula,Necromon!" he spoke moving his hands over the body, drawing forth a silvery energy and formed it into a shining ball.</p> 

<p>"May your soul join the Hallowed Halls of Jahorn!" he flung the ball into the sky. It shone brightly against the clouded sky. And with a flash, it was gone.</p> 

<p>"And may your body be returning to whence it came, our true home!" Raziel's hands crackled with energy, he brought his hands to the corpse. It glowed white-hot for an instant then turned to ash and drifted down the Chasm to Old Paineel. *(End Track)</p> 

<p>"By Cazic-Thule's hand I have bestowed the three rewards to Malik! I now take his place! SHOW ME YOUR ACCEPTANCE!" The clouded sky above boomed, and soon it rained. But not an ordinary rain, a blood rain.</p> 

<p>"By his will, I Raziel now shall be known as Hell Lord of Paineel!"</p> 
<p> -------------------------------------------
</p> <p>It was now much later, the blood rain still flowed freely. But Arorua was in shock. She was terrified and hated Raziel. However, she put up no protest when he took her to his quarters.</p> 

<p>"How could you butcher him? Wasn’t he your mentor your friend?"</p> 

<p>"Yes, Malik was. But I did not butcher him. I have given him the greatest rewards a person could ever ask. His greatest student bettered him and took his life. There is no greater honor then seeing a student surpassing the master. For countless years Malik, has trained Hell Knights, but he could never rest until, there was a succesor..Me"</p> 

<p>"But why kill him?" </p> 

<p> "Because it brings him rest, to know that his successor is greater then he ever could be. His soul can now join The Halls of Jahorn in peace, undisturbed, and his body can rest in our home. That is why." </p> 

<p> Arorua was still confused, but her anger had subsided. She did not truly understand heretic practices, and she never wanted too. However, she trusted him, she hoped that Malik was truly at rest.</p>  

<p> "Drink this" Offering her a cup</p>  

<p> "What is it?"</p>  

<p> "The rain" </p> 

<p> Arorua looked disgusted.</p>  

<p> "Just drink it. The blood rain is a sign of renewal for my people. But not just the succeeding of positions, a sign of fertility." </p> 

<p> "Oh"</p>  

<p> She flushed a deep red and drank it.</p>
