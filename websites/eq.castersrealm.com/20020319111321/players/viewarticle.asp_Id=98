	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td width='100%'><font face='verdana' size='2pt'>     In front of the House of the Silent Fist Clan in Northern Qeynos, a figure with a crystal covered shroud around his body sweeps the front, silently humming to himself and smiling. Toghan Sorast, a master of the house watched with curiosity and finally asked, “And what are you so happy about young Tyger?”

     The younger monk looked up and wiped his forehead, being careful not to hurt himself with the Essence of Dol in his left hand. He stopped humming and beamed a brighter smile then before. “I was just thinking about the old times in Freeport at the House of the Ashen Order. It has only been a year or so, but it seem like an eternity since I’ve left and ventured the world.” The old master nodded slowly and looked into Kage no Tora’s eyes; eyes that shown both fond memories but saddening trials. 

     “ Tell me Kage,” Toghan began, “How did you begin?” The other man laughed a bit and looked down, his mind wandering now to his humble beginnings. “I remember…I remember that it all started with a broom.”


     A young child dressed in cloth was struggling with a broom, trying to sweep dirt out of the doorway of the Ashen Order. His face was in a grimace as he fought with the weight of the broom and the awkward feeling of trying to maneuver such a large object. In the background, monks of the Order can be heard saying their prayers or shouting out loud battle cries as they punched and kicked. Outside of the house was the usual clanking sound of warriors running around and getting ready for combat. Now and then, an enchanter would cast a spell on a fellow adventurer. 

     The child stopped and watched as the adventurers began to depart into the Commonlands. Suddenly, a large cracking sound can be heard throughout Freeport and a searing headache formed in young Kage’s head. 

     “Ow! Why I should use this broom and…” the little monk began, stopping short at the man behind him, holding a fan. 

     “And do what little Tyger? Hit me?” Puab Cloask taunted. 

     “Maybe…you never know…” said Kage hopefully. His eyes betrayed him and showed the fear that was deep inside. The fear of disappointing the father figure that trained and raised him. “I’m sorry master. I did not mean to dishonor you.”

     Puab smiled and turned around, putting his hands behind his back to adjust his black sash. “Come little one; it is time for lunch. You have worked hard today. You may have a cookie for dessert.” Kage’s eyes shown brightly and ran quickly after his master.

     Monks of the Ashen Order sat around a large table and passed out the bread and water. Bits of meat were passed along as well. The children of the house stood on their feet a bit away from the table, holding their plates and devouring their food in silence. Finally, the eldest one, about 5 seasons above Kage whispered, “Guess what I have learned today my brothers and sisters! I have learned from our Father the technique of the Round Kick!” Then, the other children gasped in awe. 

     Kage on the other hand, was focused more on his hard earned cookie. He bit into his bread, eagerly awaiting the taste of the sweet baked treat. The child of the fifth season noticed the cookie and snatched it from Kage’s plate.

     “I have learned the Round Kick! I think I deserve this more.” The elder child bit the cookie and smiled, greed and arrogance showing in his eyes.
Kage, a bit stunned at the speed of the other monk, dropped his plate. The monks at the table turned their heads and looked up at the commotion. “That was my cookie! You have no right to take what is mine, Cathen!” The little Tyger’s face flushed red with anger and his body shook. His hands balled up into fists as he glared at Cathen.

     “Then take it back, Tyger Child… if you have the skills!” Cathen knew that he would win. The monks eating at the table stood to stop the fight, but a simple wave of the hand from the master of the house and they all stopped, a bit perplexed as why the master would let this continue. 

     “Even the other monks know that you will lose Kage. Why don’t you just clean up your mess and go back outside to train? You have fallen behind in your skills because you daydream too much!” 

     Then, Kage tried to kick his taunting opponent, but missed as Cethin turned around and delivered a round kick to the head of his younger classmate. The little Tyger fell to his side, landing hard on his shoulder. He quickly stood up, preparing for the next move.

      Ready for the next move, Cathen threw his plate like a throwing star, targeting Kage. Quickly, Kage reached for the nearest object, the broom, and struck at the plate, shattering it to the floor. The first seasoned monk fell into the fighting stance that was taught at his level and prepared for a strike. The broom’s handle lashed out at Cathen, but Kage’s opponent quickly dodged the strike and moved in to punch Kage in the eye. 

     Kage reeled back, weak already, and tried not to drop the broom. Cathen attacked with another round kick, but Kage was ready and blocked with the broom. The shaft broke in two, spreading splinters out towards the attacker. Kage grimaced as he saw his weapon destroyed and gripped the pieces harder, shocked at the strength of Cathen. Another punch flew to Kage’s mid-section, but the little Tyger blocked with one piece of the broken broom and struck with the other. Amazed that Kage learned the dual wield skill, Cathen backed away and fell into an offensive stance. Kage, still stunned at what he did, relished in the beauty of the execution of such a move. That one moment cost him as he was struck down by another round kick.

     The little Tyger fell on his face and dropped his weapons. He sniffled a bit, feeling sorry for himself and tried to stand. “I’m sorry master Puab. I will clean my mess and go practice my katas outside,” Kage mumbled slowly. The child gathered the broken pieces of the plate and scuttled off outside. Cathen, proud of what he did, crossed his arms and smiled triumphantly. 

     Silent battle cries can be heard as Kage punched and kicked. He struck as hard as he can, but his mind wasn’t focused. In his mind, all he could think about was his humiliating defeat. He stopped in mid-punch and fell on his knees to cry. “Kage!” Puab yelled, “Come here! It is time for a new lesson!”

     “Yes, Master.” 

     The child stood and wiped his face, trying putting on his strongest mask and slowly walked towards his master with his head down in shame. Puab sat down on the wooden porch and offered the little monk to sit on his knee. “You have much to learn today, little one. Wipe your tears. Do you know why you lost?”

     “I was too weak, Master.”

     Puab shook his head slowly. “No, you are wrong. It is not strength that determines the outcome of a battle. It is your emotions and desire to win that decides wether you lose or succeed. You were angry and hateful to your brother monk. Now you are sad. Do you think you will win if you fight Cathen again, my child?”

     “No, Master,” Kage said silently.

     “When you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced. Live so that when you die, the world cries and you rejoice. If you fight with a positive feeling in your soul, then you are sure to overcome any obstacle. Even Cathen; and one day even me.” Puab lowered Kage off his knee and onto the boy’s feet. He smiled and handed him a cookie and a part of the broken broom, now a club. “Also, Kage, fight with what feels more comfortable. One day you shadow will travel across the world and face many dangers. In battle, there is no time to falter because your weapon is too awkward.”

     The boy smiled at the cookie and his new club and began to take in the soft cookie. “Yes, Master Puab. I will train well and travel the world one day. I will learn everything there is to know.”
Puab merely smiled and went back into the house.


     “A while after, I focused on my training and surpassed Cathen. Sometimes we would hunt together in the Commonlands or North Ro, but we fought a lot. I always won of course…” Kage said, beaming a smile at Toghan. The old man nodded his head and returned the smile. “I hope that you succeed in what you train in Shadow of the Tyger. You have many adventures ahead of you. You have many friends to make. You have even more lessons to learn and skills to perfect,” Toghan said as he went back inside the house.

     Kage couldn’t help but smile again and continued sweeping. After a few motions, he dropped his broom and bent over to pick it up. “Stupid broom…”
