  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'>Once you finally make it to level 15 and get your better healing and buff spells, it's time to stop pitying yourself for not matching up to the other classes, and start kicking butt and taking names! Holy Knights unite!

I've seen it suggested before, and it's true. The Windmill is the best place for XP, and if you play it right, you'll be there for the next 8-10 levels. No more having to make long trips searching for prime hunting ground; it's all here.

I'm going to be different than the other guides, however, and explain every step. You first need to travel to Firiona Vie, located in Kunark, and is easily reachable by boat.

There is a Paladin Guild, but be forewarned. The guildmaster is a high-elf and will likely not teach you (I know for a fact he won't if you're human), so you're on your own for a while. You must build faction with this city by killing goblins..lots and lots of them, before he'll change his demeanor and offer to train you. That's why it's best to make sure you're at least level 15 before travelling here, and making sure you have every spell bought beforehand. Also, do whatever you can to have someone Bind you here. It is not fun to have to travel back from freeport when you die. It's a 15-20min trip!

Once you feel you're ready to adventure (make sure you have at least 40+ food AND water..I'll explain shortly), head out off the main bridge, past the guard, and follow the left coastline until you see the waterfall. Do NOT attack any of the pilgrims or pixisticks (my nickname for the butterfly creatures). They are goodnatured woodland creatures and you will severely damage your faction within the city. Just run past them to the waterfall. Now you realize why you need so many supplies. At the teen levels, you're in for the stealth journey of your life. You need to zone, and to do that you'll need to follow the small waterfall uphill, and follow the creek until you zone. 

The problem? Drachnids. Part humanoid, part spider, the area is densely populated with these extremely evil and perceptive creatures. Take extreme caution, because if you agro one (and they agro from very long range at times), you probably won't last 15-20 seconds without any protection. They have root as well as SOW, so don't count on that to help you. Invis works, so get it from someone if you can. If not, the Drachs will pop on you constantly so don't just truck through there like you own the place, or you'll be dead quicker than you can say Paladin Porkchop. Work your way along the creek slowly, watching in all directions for them as you move forward. If you see one in front of you, wait and let it pass before moving on. If you hear creepy movement behind you, run and hope it hasn't detected you. Keep following the creek and you'll eventually zone. You don't want to travel back this way unless you have to. And if you think finally Dinging in at level 20 will help you...think again ;)

If you made it, congratulations, you just completed the hardest part of this entire guide...making it to where you want to hunt! :) Follow the creek until its mouth spills into the lake. From there, make a left and follow the left-most edge of the mountains, travelling forward until you see the unique blades of the mill spinning in the distance. You're there! 

People say it can get overcrowded, and it does sometimes, but more often than not it's a pretty good average, with more than enough mobs to keep everyone happy. To stay safe, you simply wait and watch from the mill. See something you like, pull and fight. Be careful when travelling toward mountains to pull via melee. Often the mob will have companions with him, and you'll end up attracting 2 or 3 at once. You may see the occasional green tiger, but 99% will con at least blue, with many yellows and reds. Stay away from the tougher mobs, and you'll find plenty of blues to hunt here. What's so great about this place is that if you stick near the mill and you're in trouble, there's almost always a person or group in their 20s who are willing to help you out in a tight situation. Just don't take advantage of their kindness, or you'll find yourself alone with no one to /yell to. Some putz decided to take advantage of the fact that me and a couple other guys always healed/buffed him when he was fighting a yellow. So he kept fighting only yellows, still expecting us to use our mana for his hunt and XP, yelling help whenever he would get low. He learned a hard lesson after the 3rd-4th time.

Sarnaks, Goblins, Skeletons, Tigresses, and Iksars are what you will mainly find. Excepting those like who I described above, you will have plenty of opportunity to help out others who you are not grouped with. They will appreciate it and over time you'll find yourself pretty well buffed up without asking for a single one.

As you gain in level, you'll see there's no need to move around much at all. The yellows become blue and the reds become yellow, and so on. There is a great goblin mine entrance once you climb a few more levels, just make sure you group and watch for the casters. As for the Mill, though, unless you've got friends who you like to hunt with, I suggest soloing. As I mentioned previously, you can probably get help if you stick close to the mill while fighting, and there are so many mobs to hunt (though it can get sparse at times) that soloing is actually viable here.

That food and water needs to last you, because the trip back to FV is not fun. Drachville again. From the mill it's much easier to get an invis from someone, but remember that it's a 2-way trip. It's not going to last that long. Besides, inside the mill are some vendors who will buy the loot you find, so weight won't become an issue while hunting.

Yes, staying in the same spot can get very tedious and boring, but the XP is well worth it. So to review...

1) Bind at least in FV
2) Take a huge supply of food and drink
3) Use extreme caution when navigating creek
4) Do not travel too far from Mill to hunt or pull
5) Have fun, and don't die!</td></tr>
