<td width='80%'>Guide to Raiding Lady Vox ** Last updated 01 August 2001<br>
<br>
RAIDING LADY VOX - Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule<br>
Greetings all. I've written this guide to explain how a textbook Vox raid is done. This is the compilation of my observations on both good &amp; bad raids and numerous &quot;guides&quot; that I have found that were often lacking. It also includes my insights from the 10+ successful Vox raids I have hosted. For many players, dragon hunts are their first foray into large scale raids and if you have never done one before, this guide will explain a lot of what is going on, and what you need to do. Most of all, be patient. Pulling off a large raid can take a bit of time, especially if the raid is short of certain classes.<br>
<br>
WHAT YOU NEED<br>
1. You should be between levels 45 and 52. Clerics as low as 39 (with complete heal) are also useful.<br>
2. An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 50 and a Cold Resistance of 100. The higher the better.<br>
3. Bring two peridots: one for cleric and one for enchanter. These will be used for beneficial spells. <br>
4. Check with raid leader on how loot will be distributed.<br>
<br>
HOW TO GET THERE<br>
1. Closest Druid portal: North Karana<br>
2. Closest Wizard portal: SE corner of West Karana<br>
3. Timorous Deep fire pot room (-12100, 4200). The pot in the SE corner - on the south wall - will transport you onto the docks in Halas. If you attempt this route, just be careful of dragon that occasionally appears near the pot room. This can be a very quick way to get to Halas if you are in near Timorous and have access to SoW and levitate.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER<br>
1. Vox is a level 55 Dragon with Cleric spells.<br>
2. Vox's most deadly weapon is her AE cold breath and AE fear spell. Wear as much MR/CR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC) to get these as high as possible.<br>
3. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 2xPlatinum Peridot Ring (AC4 CR10), Cloak of the Icebear (AC8 HP10 CR20), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20), Velium Round Shield (AC15 CR10), and Gnomish Environmental Suit (AC9 FR10 CR10 PR10). There are a wealth of other items available, especially with the addition of SoV.<br>
4. Many of the mobs in Permafrost have high cold resist - including Vox, use fire based spells where possible for minimum resists.<br>
5. In order to cast any spell on Vox - YOU MUST BE WITHIN HER MELEE RANGE.<br>
<br>
THINGS TO DO BEFORE RAID<br>
Single biggest delay to raiding Vox: people not arriving on time. If there were 30+ of the right people ready to raid, the whole thing could be over in an hour or two. Permafrost is in a remote location, so I recommend doing the following, the day before the raid.<br>
1. If you are a melee, get transport to NK/WK and get a bind in Halas.<br>
2. If you are a caster, bind just inside Permafrost or just outside in Everfrost.<br>
3. Set up hotkeys for Disciplines if you have them.<br>
4. If you have programmed any of your hotkeys to include non-critical comments get rid of them to cut down on spam &amp; the associated lag (e.g. &quot;/say I am assisting %T&quot;). Information that is critical to battle (e.g. Heal, Lay-on-Hands, Tash, slow) are fine.<br>
5. Get your MR/CR gear ready in backpacks so that it is ready to equip quickly.<br>
6. Check with friends if they would like to attend raid. Lining up some backups can make the difference in going ahead versus rescheduling a raid.<br>
7. Kill Ice Giants. 3 are located outside Permafrost and others are inside the zone. All yield decent experience and loot even in the 50s.<br>
8. Get CR bracers. The Ice Goblin King has &quot;Symbols of Loyalty to Vox&quot; bracers AC7 CR7. They aren't lore, so opportunists often stock up on them and sell to others before the fight.<br>
9. Get CR leggings. Elite Goblin Guards occasionally have AC8 CR5 legs.<br>
10. If you don't have one, get a weight reduction backpack off Goblin Archeologist.<br>
11. Stay in the area and build factions. Kill Black Burrow gnolls for druid &amp; Qeynos factions. Collect teeth, and turn in 4 at a time to female warrior near PvP area in Halas for barbarian factions.<br>
12. Camp in Qeynos Hills for the Fishbone Earring or the Glowing Black Stone.<br>
<br>
STAGING PHASE<br>
1. When you are in Everfrost or Permafrost, report in to the raid leader.<br>
2. The raid leader may tell you if the raid is short of certain classes. Check with friends if asked.<br>
3. Turn off anonymous when you show up.<br>
4. Assemble near Goblin King for temporary groups.<br>
5. The raid leader, pullers, and group Leaders will use Shout channel. All other communication should be on the OOC channel.<br>
6. If you are looking for action, kill Ice Giants. These are all on random timers and yield decent exp and loot.<br>
7. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and the attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical areas (clerics, enchanters, bards, and nukers).<br>
<br>
<br>
KILLING VOX'S GUARDS PHASE<br>
1. Once enough people are present, final groups will be assigned.<br>
2. Unless you are being directed to pull, stay in the King Area. Stay back, if you are close to the giant door, you could pick up Vox agro while guards are being pulled. If so, you could be summoned and killed by Vox.<br>
3. The main and secondary assists will be named. Create a hotkey for each.<br>
4. The raid leader and backup leader will be named. Take instructions from either leader.<br>
5. The pullers will begin pulling the guards from Vox's chamber to the groups. This phase is often tricky and the puller may die from inadvertent Vox agros. All these mobs are on an approximate 4 hour timer. There will be a countdown on each of the guards as they are killed (i.e., &quot;Pulling guard 1 of 5&quot;). When the last guard is killed, the raid leader will likely name final groups.<br>
6. Form into final groups. Write down all members on paper for future reference (with so many people, it may be difficult to target someone with a mouse, so just use the &quot;/target [name]&quot; command). Never know if your group leader will go LD and someone else needs to step in. Also, when last person has joined, everyone should say their class and level.<br>
7. The raid leader will annouce &quot;Prepare to move&quot;.<br>
8. The raid leader will announce &quot;Move&quot;. All groups will move to the waiting area near the lair. If you have never been to the safe spot, DO NOT RUN AHEAD. There are invisible pit traps that will result in a quick death in the pits below. The one due East from &quot;2&quot; on the map above is particularly bad with 6 mobs in the pits below.<br>
9. Nuking casters will bind on the ramp, so that in death, can mem critical spells and jump back into the fight. In the past, players sometimes left a couple coins on the ground to prevent empty corpses from vanishing if dying again. An alternate approach was to have everyone in group create a &quot;/split 0 0 0 6&quot; key, which can be used prior to someone coming back into the fight.<br>
10. Recomend that you go through entire attack plan and buffing information at this point. The two key things to stress are: (1) NEVER PUSH VOX ON A WALL and (2) IF YOU FALL INTO PIT, STAY THERE AND DIE.<br>
<br>
BUFFING PHASE<br>
1. A list of casters will be named #1-14 and will correspond to the buff number.<br>
2. Go to your graphic and filter options and turn everything off or to minimum (spell effects, level of detail, damage shield messages, etc).<br>
3. All non-buffers will be stripped of all buffs.<br>
4. Once stripped, all buffers &amp; all bards will disband from the groups. Temporary buffer groups will be formed. Generally done by having 2 buff stations. Station #1 on first ramp, and station #2 on second ramp. Clarity should be kept on all buffers and teamed with bards. If there are 2 or more necros, keep chloro and bard singing mana/heal so that the necros can pump mana. Groups with necros and magicians should be done last to maximize mana feeding time.<br>
5. The raid leader will call out a group to get buffed. This group should move to the buff groups and get all of the buffs listed in the next step. Give a peridot to the cleric and the enchanter when ready for those buffs.<br>
6. The buffs should be done in mana/time order to maximize buff time.<br>
#01 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist fire)<br>
#02 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison)<br>
#03 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease)<br>
#04 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. ultravision) - rangers may want to do &quot;call of sky&quot; for stun proc.<br>
#05 shaman - talisman of altuna - HP238 (250mana - 72min)<br>
#06 shaman - stamina - STA37 (~100HP) (100 - 63min)<br>
#07 cleric - symbol of naltron - HP525 Peridot (315mana - 54min)<br>
#08 cleric - shield of words - AC32 (300 - 72min)<br>
#09 cleric - heroism - AC20 HP400 (140mana - 72min)<br>
#10 enchanter - rune IV / V - DMG620/700 Peridot (350mana - 110min)<br>
#11 enchanter - group resist magic - MR55 (200mana - 36min)<br>
#12 enchanter - haste / clarity - (185mana - 16min/75mana - 27min)<br>
#13 druid - circle of summer - group CR45 (150mana - 36min)<br>
#14 druid - chloro (200mana - 15min)<br>
#15 open - for bard resist song<br>
7. Note: depending on classes attending, necros can also do resist cold and druids could do resist magic.<br>
8. Once buffed, the group should disband, OOC done, and camp out. I suggest having groups 1/2 camp at top, 3/4/enc group camp on first landing, and all other groups at bottom.<br>
9. When back at the server selection screen, go to the chat area, and go to the server chat (Cazic-Thule in my case). Wait here until someone gets on and says everyone should log back.<br>
10. Once everyone has been buffed, the temporary buff groups will form groups of 5, buff themselves, and recover mana.<br>
11. Someone will camp and tell the chat room that the attack will start momentarily. Give group leaders 30 seconds head start.<br>
12. When you log back in - turn on WALK. Vox will cast fear, and it is best to be walk mode. If you have run mode on and vox fears you, you may wind up in the pits.<br>
13. Reform final groups, and OOC ready.<br>
14. Any class that has a pet should summon one.<br>
<br>
ASSAULTING VOX<br>
1. Only the raid leader and/or backup leader will shout attack instructions. Smooth raids are ones where everyone knows what to do and follows instructions.<br>
2. [RL: Group 1/2 to rock]. Groups 1 and 2 move up to the rock entering her chamber.<br>
3. [RL: Prepare for attack on the count of 3]. Bards should start to play Elemental Rhythms with a drum (which should add approximately 71MR, 71CR, and 71FR).<br>
4. [RL: Group 1/2 attack]. The main tank groups (1-2) will rush Vox, activate disciplines (if you have them), surround her on all sides, and attack. Bards will not attack with hand-to-hand (insignficant melee damage and Vox ripostes can cause significant damage). The safest place for a bard to fight will be directly below Vox's stomach near her hind legs. If lag is minimal and it is possible, twist Guardian Rythms ( 71MR and 10AC), or other buffs.<br>
5. If Vox is in the narrow area leading to the rock, it is critical that the first tank groups push her into the center of the room. If she is in that area, it is the same as if she was stuck on a wall and will CH repeatedly.<br>
6. Healers for the tank groups will remain near the rock entrance.<br>
7. [RL: Group 3/4 attack. Enc group enter]Once she is in center of room and surrounded. The other tank groups can enter (groups 3/4) along with the enchanters &amp; shaman and attack. Other groups can move to the rock entrance and wait.<br>
8. If for any reason, you get feared and find yourself in the pits, stay there and die. Do not bring more mobs to the fight.<br>
9. A major key to killing Vox is to not push her onto a wall. IF VOX GETS PUSHED ONTO A WALL SHE WILL STAND THERE, HEAL HERSELF, AND SUMMON PEOPLE. Those that are between Vox and the nearest wall should not taunt. If you are near the wall and are the current agro, move away from the wall.<br>
<br>
EARLY INTO FIGHT<br>
10. [RL: Enchanters dispell now]. Every enchanter should run to Vox and dispel two times to remove all her buffs (remember to stand within melee range). If short on enc, other classes can dispell. Vox has the old-world max of 32k hitpoints, and the dispels should remove her cleric buffs and will effectively reduce her hitpoints. Each enchanter should OOC &quot;Dispelled&quot; once two successful dispells are complete.<br>
11. Once finished dispelling, enchanters should immediately begin mana sieving her, and continue to sieve until Vox is dead.<br>
12. [RL: Debuf / Slow now]. Once all dispells are done, the debufs should come. Shamans should immediately begin to attempt to slow/debuf Vox and should OOC successes (&quot;Slowed&quot;, &quot;Malosied&quot;, etc). If any 53+ characters are present on the raid, they can attempt to attack/debuf/slow at this time. Bards may consider adding a debuf to twist (1 does fire resist, 1 does magic resist).<br>
13. Necros should avoid spells that turn Vox into a skeleton. This makes it very difficult to find the mob with so many people.<br>
14. Healers should remain near the rock until needed. If there is only a single person in the group taking damage, they should move back to the rock and get a heal. This allows the healers to stay out of Vox's breath range. If a number of people have taken damage, the healer should come to the group. The safest place for a healer to stand is behind Vox outside breath range.<br>
15. Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their group. Bard resistances are preventing an enormous amount of damage, and bards have the fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only class that will not come back to the rock for healing if they are the only one taking damage. Bards are keeping groups alive, keep them alive.<br>
16. Healers/Paladins should call out in OOC any LoH or CH.<br>
17. Necros should pump mana to clerics and enchanters.<br>
<br>
AT 60% HEALTH:<br>
18. [RL: Pets attack now]. Pets are called in to attack.<br>
19. [RL: Tash now]. 1 enchanter should Tash Vox and should OOC &quot;Tashed&quot; if successful. If Vox agros and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should not be healed (hate will be transfered to healer and healer will die). Heal the enchanter if they live. If agroed, the enchanter can use this opportunity to pull Vox into the center of the room. The risk to enc tashing is rather low by the time Vox has reached the 60 percent mark. <br>
20. [RL: Stun, bash, slam]. Everyone begins chain-stunning, bashing, and slamming Vox. Although, stuns will not actually stun her, it will interrupt her from casting heal spells. Continue to stun her until she is dead. Vox is a cleric AI and will attempt to Complete Heal herself. If she does get one off, it is not the end of the world, it will heal approximately 5k of hitpoints.<br>
<br>
AT 50% HEALTH<br>
21.[ RL: Nuke now]. Nukes and casters will be called in. Remember to get within melee range or your spell will not land. Melee classes that cannot cast stun should nuke as well. Nuke until Vox is dead.<br>
22. [RL: Reserves Attack now]. Any melee groups held in reserve should attack<br>
23. If a caster dies, memorize critical spells and rejoin the fight. All rezzes will be done when Vox goes down.<br>
24. If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can move to center of room and suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (Vox targeted) for 300+ damage.<br>
<br>
AT 20% HEALTH<br>
25. [RL: Wizards Nuke now]. Wizards are called in at 20% health for nuking.<br>
26. Continue to mana seive, interrupt, and nuke Vox until dead.<br>
<br>
VOX DEATH<br>
1. Vox's corpse should not decay for 30 minutes until after she dies.<br>
2. The group leader of the killing group should inspect the body and tell the raid leader which items are present. Some raids will have a trusted member lock the corpse until the raid leader can get to the corpse.<br>
3. No one else should inspect the body. The raid leader will loot and distribute items.<br>
4. All resurrections will be performed at this time. Temporary groups may be assigned with clerics &amp; bards to minimize time. Any bodies from pits will be recovered at this time as well.<br>
<br>
THE LOOT<br>
Ah, dragon loot. What caster wouldn't want a +15wis/+15int item? What tank doesnt want haste? Who wouldn't want a 100% weight reduction 10-slot bag that holds XL items? Or listened to cheers as a paladin or a bard gets a critical item in their epic quest? A staff that allows anyone to resurrect - a fantastic raid item.<br>

11. White Dragon Scale - used for bard epic &amp; white dragonscale cloak quest.<br>
<br>
LOOT RULES<br>
1. Depending on the raid, loot rules can differ widely. Be sure to check before joining the raid. Some items may be claimed by the raid leader or hosting guild.<br>
2. Typically, each class eligible for an item is assigned a number and a random is performed to award the item. If eligible, raid leaders and group leaders should state which numbers they have prior to the roll.<br>
3. Although some items are all/all, some should be restricted to benefit the classes that could use the item the most - as opposed to being up for sale at the EC bazaar minutes after the fight ends:<br>
a. Runed Bolster Belt: Melees / Hybrids<br>
b. Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch: Casters<br>
c. White Dragon Scale: Bards (for epic quest - only alternate source for scale is Gorenaire). IF open to casters, I would suggest giving bards 5-10 numbers each, thus allowing increased odds at getting scale, but allowing everyone else a chance as well. If another class wins the role, chances are, it will be sold (for significant pp - on some servers over 100k) to a bard unable to kill Vox due to level limitations and the caster will buy a better cloak (Heirophant for 35k) and pocket the difference. Many bards hoping to see an epic someday are stuck at 52, unwilling to level, because Gorenaire is so difficult to kill. Also to note, while performing the bard epic, bards can re-spawn Trakanon, and the respawn will always drop the final epic piece + a random breastplate. Thus, allowing a bard to loot will eventually result in an extra bp at a later date. As a 52 bard myself, I am only a few items away from an epic (small guild, most items from small raids), a bard with a white scale is almost a bard with an epic.<br>
d. Staff of Forbidden Rites: Sometimes open to all. Most people donate to guild vault and loan to monks when raiding Hate &amp; Fear (or other difficult zones). In the event of a wipe-out, the monk can use to rez a cleric, thus avoiding redoing a full break-in. Personally, I like to limit to 50+ monk/sk, and if they have it, open to all.<br>

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES<br>
It is possible for a level 53+ player to directly assist in a Vox fight, but it is moderated by getting expelled by Vox (other than buffs prior to a fight). If you get placed on her hate list, you will be expelled.<br>
1. Casting a spell on Vox will cause you to get expelled. The spell may or may not land. Spells that cause waves of damage appear to work - subsequent to the first wave.<br>
2. Healing people fighting Vox will result in an expulsion. The heal will generally take, lower level heals (non-CH) will sometimes allow you to cast more than one prior to expulsion.<br>
3. Getting too close to Vox may result in an expulsion. The agro radius is quite large.<br>
4. Some groups have used CoH (Call of Heros) to heal people. Since CoH wipes a persons hate list, someone can be summoned, have CH cast on them, and return to the fight. Since the hate list was cleared with the CoH, the healer is not placed on hate list.<br>
5. Some raids have used 53+ characters to keep any respawned ice giants from bothering the Vox group.<br>

Guide to Raiding Lord Nagafen ** Last updated 01 August 2001<br>
<br>
RAIDING LORD NAGAFEN - Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule<br>
Greetings all. I've written this guide to explain how a textbook Naggy raid is done. This is the compilation of my observations on both good &amp; bad raids and numerous &quot;guides&quot; that I have found that were often lacking. For many players, dragon hunts are their first foray into large scale raids and if you have never done one before, this guide will explain a lot of what is going on, and what you need to do. Most of all, be patient. Pulling off a large raid can take a bit of time, especially if the raid is short of certain classes.<br>
<br>
WHAT YOU NEED<br>
1. You should be between levels 45 and 52. Clerics as low as 39 (with complete heal) are also useful.<br>
2. An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 50 and a Fire Resistance of 100. The higher the better.<br>
3. Bring two peridots: one for cleric and one for enchanter. These will be used for beneficial spells. <br>
4. Check with raid leader on how loot will be distributed.<br>
<br>
HOW TO GET THERE<br>
1. Closest Druid portal: Lavastorm<br>
2. Closest Wizard portal: SE corner of Nekulos Forest<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER<br>
1. Naggy is a level 55 Dragon Warrior.<br>
2. Naggy's most deadly weapon is his AE fire breath and AE fear spell. Wear as much MR/FR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC) to get these as high as possible.<br>
3. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 2xEarring of Fire Reflection (AC1 FR5 ~26pp at lavastorm gypsies), Gold Diamond Mask (FR10 CR10 MR3), Gold Hermatite Necklace (FR7), Gold Emerald Bracelet (AC4 FR6), Platinum Emerald Ring (AC4 FR10), Hand Woven Legging (AC8 FR10), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), and Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20).<br>
4. Many of the mobs in Solusek have high fire resist - including Nag, use cold based spells where possible for minimum resists.<br>
5. In order to cast any spell on a dragon - YOU MUST BE WITHIN HIS MELEE RANGE.<br>
<br>
STAGING PHASE<br>
1. When you are in Lavastorm or Solusek, report in to the raid leader.<br>
2. The raid leader may tell if the raid is short of certain classes. Check with friends if asked.<br>
3. Turn off anonymous when you show up.<br>
4. The raid leader, pullers, and group leaders will use shout channel. All other communication should be on the OOC channel.<br>
5. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and the attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical areas (clerics, enchanters, bards, nukers).<br>
<br>
ASSEMBLY OPTIONS<br>
1. Assemble in Lavastorm and fight en-mass through giants or meet at stone spider room.<br>
2. Single late comers may need to be CoH if past giants. If multiple people, they can form temporary groups and fight back to staging area outside Nag Lair. If need be, spiders can be pulled to assembly area to keep path free.<br>
<br>
KILLING GIANTS PHASE<br>
1. Once enough people are present, final groups will be assigned.<br>
2. Unless you are being directed to pull, stay back.<br>
3. The main and secondary assists will be named. Create a hotkey for each.<br>
4. The raid leader and backup leader will be named. Take instructions from either leader.<br>
5. Form into final groups. Write down all members on paper for future reference (with so many people, it may be difficult to target someone with a mouse, so just use the &quot;/target [name]&quot; command).<br>
6. The pullers will begin pulling the giants to the groups. This phase is often tricky and the puller may die. All these mobs are on an approximate 8 hour timer. When the last giant is killed, the groups will move to the safe spot in the hallway near Nag's chambers. Once this phase starts, please do not go go afk.<br>
7. Nuking casters will bind in the camp spot, so that in death, can mem critical spells and jump back into the fight. In the past, players sometimes left a couple coins on the ground to prevent empty corpses from vanishing if dieing again. An alternate approach wass to have everyone in group create a &quot;/split 0 0 0 6&quot; key, which can be used prior to someone coming back into the fight.<br>
8. Raid leader should go through the entire attack plan and buffing information at this point.<br>
<br>
BUFFING PHASE<br>
1. A list of casters will be named #1-14 and will correspond to the buff number.<br>
2. Go to your graphic and filter options and turn everything off or to minimum (spell effects, level of detail, damage shield messages, etc).<br>
3. All non-buffers will be stripped of all buffs.<br>
4. Once stripped, all buffers &amp; all bards will disband from the groups. Temporary buffer groups will be formed. Suggest that you do 2 buffing stations inside the dragon skull room. Do station #1 at left pot and station #2 at right pot. If 3 is possible, do it near the teeth. Clarity should be kept on all buffers and teamed with bards. If there are 2 or more necros, keep chloro and bard singing mana/heal so that the necros can pump mana). Groups with magicians and necros should be buffed last to allow them to feed mana longer.<br>
5. The raid leader will call out a group to get buffed. This group should move to the buff groups and get all of the buffs listed in the next step. Give a peridot to the cleric and the enchanter when ready for those buffs.<br>
6. The buffs should be done in mana/time order to maximize buff time.<br>
#01 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist cold)<br>
#02 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison)<br>
#03 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease, strength)<br>
#04 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. ultravision)<br>
#05 shaman - talisman of altuna - HP238 (250mana - 72min)<br>
#06 shaman - stamina - STA37 (~100HP) (100 - 63min)<br>
#07 cleric - symbol of naltron - HP525 Peridot (315mana - 54min)<br>
#08 cleric - shield of words - AC32 (300 - 72min)<br>
#09 cleric - heroism - AC20 HP400 (140mana - 72min)<br>
#10 enchanter - rune IV / V - DMG620/700 Peridot (350mana - 110min)<br>
#11 enchanter - group resist magic - MR55 (200mana - 36min)<br>
#12 enchanter - haste / clarity - (185mana - 16min/75mana - 27min)<br>
#13 druid - circle of winter - group CR45 (150mana - 36min)<br>
#14 druid - chloro (200mana - 15min)<br>
#15 open - for bard resist song<br>
7. Once buffed, the group should disband, OOC done, and camp out.<br>
8. When back at the server selection screen, go to the chat area, and go to the server chat (Cazic-Thule in my case). Wait here until someone gets on and says everyone should log back.<br>
9. Once everyone has been buffed, the temporary buff groups will form groups of 5, buff themselves, and recover mana.<br>
10. Someone will camp and tell the chat room that the attack will start momentarily. Give group leaders a 30 second head start.<br>
11. When you log back in - turn on WALK. Nagafen will cast fear, and it is best to be walk mode. If you have run mode on and he fears you, you may wind up in lava.<br>
12. Reform final groups.<br>
13. Any class that has a pet should summon one.<br>
<br>
ASSAULTING NAG<br>
1. Only the raid leader and/or backup leader will shout attack instructions. Smooth raids are ones where everyone knows what to do and follows instructions.<br>
2. [RL: Prepare for attack on the count of 3!]. Bards should start to play Elemental Rhythms with a drum (which should add approximately 71MR, 71CR, and 71FR).<br>
3. [RL: Group 1 and 2 attack]. The main tank groups will rush Nag, activate disciplines (if you have them), and attack. Bards will not attack with hand-to-hand (insignficant melee damage and Nag ripostes can cause significant damage). The safest place for a bard to fight will be directly below stomach near his hind legs. If lag is minimal and it is possible, twist Guardian Rythms ( 71MR and 10AC), or other buffs.<br>
4. Goal is to push Nag from the bridge to the back wall. This creates more distance from the lava in case someone is feared, and allows clerics to heal from bridge without being in AE range.<br>
5. [RL: Group 3 and 4 attack]. If a lot of melees are present and you have 4-5 groups, two more groups can be sent in once Nagafen is slightly back from the bridge and there is a little more room to work with.<br>
6. Once Nagafen is on back wall, surround him on 3 sides and keep him there.<br>
7. Healers for the tank groups will remain near the bridge.<br>
<br>
EARLY INTO FIGHT<br>
8. [RL: Debuf now]. Shamans should immediately begin to attempt to slow/debuf Nag and should OOC sucesses (&quot;Slowed&quot;, &quot;Malosied&quot;, etc). If any 53+ characters are present on the raid, they can attempt to attack/debuf/slow at this time. Bards may consider adding a debuf to twist (1 does cold resist, 1 does magic resist).<br>
9. Necros should avoid spells that turn Nag into a skeleton. This makes it very difficult to find the mob with so many people.<br>
10. Healers should remain back at the bridge until needed. If there is only a single person in the group taking damage, they should move back to the bridge and get a heal. This allows the healers to stay out of breath range. If a number of people have taken damage, the healer should come to the group. The safest place for a healer to stand is on the bridge outside breath range.<br>
11. Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their group. Bard resistances are preventing an enormous amount of AE fire damage, and bards have the fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only class that will not come back to the bridge for healing if they are the only one taking damage. Bards are keeping groups alive, keep them alive.<br>
12. Healers/Paladins should call out in OOC any LoH or CH.<br>
13. Necros should pump mana to clerics.<br>
<br>
AT 60% HEALTH:<br>
14. [RL: Pets attack now]. Pets are called in to attack.<br>
15. [RL: Tash now]. 1 enchanter should Tash and should OOC &quot;Tashed&quot; if successful. If Nag agros and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should not be healed (hate will be transfered to healer and healer will die). Heal the enchanter if they live.<br>
16. Enchanters will have hard time landing any damage spell on Nagafen. Best use may be to cast rune on Nagafen's current target. <br>
<br>
AT 50% HEALTH<br>
17. [RL: Nuke now]. Nukes and casters will be called in. Remember to get within melee range or your spell will not land. Nuke until Nag is dead.<br>
18. [RL: Reserves Attack now]. Any melee groups held in reserve should attack.<br>
19. If a caster dies, memorize critical spells and rejoin the fight. All rezzes will be done when Nag goes down.<br>
20. If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can move away from Nagafen and suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (dragon targeted) for 300+ damage.<br>
<br>
AT 20% HEALTH<br>
21. [RL: Wizards Nuke now]. Wizards are called in at 20% health for nuking.<br>
<br>
NAG DEATH<br>
1. Nag's corpse should not decay for 30 minutes until after he dies.<br>
2. The group leader of the killing group should inspect the body and tell the raid leader which items are present. Some raids will have a trusted member lock the corpse until the raid leader can get to the corpse.<br>
3. No one else should inspect the body. The raid leader will loot and distribute items.<br>
4. All resurrections will be performed at this time. Temporary groups may be assigned with clerics &amp; bards to minimize time. <br>
<br>
THE LOOT<br>

LOOT RULES<br>
1. Depending on the raid, loot rules can differ widely. Be sure to check before joining the raid. Some items may be claimed by the raid leader or hosting guild.<br>
2. Typically, each class eligible for an item is assigned a number and a random is performed to award the item. If eligible, raid leaders and group leaders should state which numbers they have prior to the roll.<br>
3. Although some items are all/all, some should be restricted to benefit the classes that could use the item the most - as opposed to being up for sale at the EC bazaar minutes after the fight ends:<br>
a. Cloak of Flames: Melees / Hybrids<br>
b. Gauntlets of Firey Might: Monks<br>
c. Red Dragon Scale: Bards &amp; Warriors for epic quest.<br>
<br>
MISCELLANEOUS NOTES<br>
It is possible for a level 53+ player to directly assist in a Nag fight, but it is moderated by getting expelled by Nag (other than buffs prior to a fight). If you get placed on his hate list, you will be expelled.<br>
1. Casting a spell on Nag will cause you to get expelled. The spell may or may not land. Spells that cause waves of damage appear to work - subsequent to the first wave.<br>
2. Healing people fighting Nag will result in an expulsion. The heal will generally take, lower level heals (non-CH) will sometimes allow you to cast more than one prior to expulsion.<br>
3. Getting too close to Nag may result in an expulsion. The agro radius is quite large.<br>
4. Some groups have used CoH (Call of Heros) to heal people. Since CoH wipes a persons hate list, someone can be summoned, have CH cast on them, and return to the fight. Since the hate list was cleared with the CoH, the healer is not placed on hate list.<br>
5. Some raids have used 53+ characters to keep any adds from bothering the raid group.<br>
