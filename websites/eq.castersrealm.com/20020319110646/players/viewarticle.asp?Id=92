The blood pouring from her many wounds was definitely real, and certainly not part of the illusion, the curse. But it was worth it.</p>
<p>Emyrald felt that she had achieved a new level of power, and believed herself to be ready to take on the 16th circle of spells. She looked back at the last battle with the Orc Warrior.</p>
<p>Her group had been busy destroying several Undead, but she had used up her store of mana. She had been meditating to regain her lost power with her pet by her side, away from her group, when she heard an Orc battle cry resound from behind her. She immediately sprang up and cast a powerful Shock of Blades spell. The Orc staggered as thousands of tiny blades were conjured into his very being and cut through vitally important organs. But it still came at her.</p>
<p>“Golem, leave off,” she said in a clear, crisp, commanding tone. If it weren’t for her calmness of voice, the Water Elemental, which she called a Golem, would have sprung in to defend its Master. But the Golem realized that its Master had everything under control. It did not enter the fight, but looked upon the Orc with such anger in its eyes that Emyrald knew that, if she required help, she would have it in a split second.</p>
<p>The Orc Warrior was armed with a bronze short sword, no doubt stolen from the local traders. The sword met with her iron staff with several metallic clangs. Emyrald brought the staff down upon the Orcs head, a crushing blow that made the Orc wince and stagger. Emyrald used this split second to her advantage, again conjuring the thousands of microscopic razors into the Orcs flesh. This did far more damage than her staff ever could. But now she had used up all of her remaining mana.</p>
<p>The Orc soon recovered, and the battle raged on. By now her group had dealt with the undead, and would have joined in the battle if It weren’t for the fact that her Golem was merely watching the fight, and not involved in it whatsoever. They joined the Golem in watching the pair face off.</p>
<p>Emyrald’s staff whirled in her hand and hit doubly, knocking the Orc off balance. She continued her attacks, pressing harder and harder, getting into the battle even more. Cold fury blazed in her red eyes.</p>
<p>But Emyrald was not the only one who was scoring hits. The Orc’s bronze blade was smeared with blood. Red blood, the group members noticed. It wasn’t blue or black like Dark Elves. This was interesting indeed.</p>
<p>The battle continued. Emyrald’s staff cracked against the Orc many times, causing incredible internal injuries, while the Orc’s sword met with her body in several nicks, cuts, and the occasional blunt side bruise. But the Orc was losing.</p>
<p>Emyrald’s eyes narrowed as she concentrated on her target. Her vision was becoming a bit blurry, but she could still easily make out her opponent. And a thought came to her. She took her staff and blocked the Orc’s latest press, and then whirled it around to strike at the Orc’s hand. She hit, and the bronze blade flew off. Her Golem picked it up.</p>
<p>Emyrald saw fear emanating from the Orc’s sickly yellow eyes. The Orc turned tail and hollered for help, but it was far too late.</p>
<p>“Golem, go forth!” Emyrald cried. The Water Golem floated over to the Orc, and, with one fell swoop of its staff, knocked the Orc dead.</p>
<p>Emyrald remembered this fight with extreme intensity. It had, perhaps, been one of her most challenging duels. But she had felt the power rise within her when that Orc had died. Indeed, her group mates had felt it too, and realized that they were now outmatched.</p>
<p>With a barely perceptible nod of her head, Emyrald told the group leader she was leaving. Then she went over to her Golem and placed her hand on its head. In a blazing flash of light, the Golem disappeared, giving Emyrald the energy she required to create a gateway to her bind point, the tunnel of the Eastern Commons. She summoned this gateway, and left the Oasis of Marr, and the corpse of the Orc, behind her.</p>

<p>Now Emyrald’s dilemma forced itself into her head. She had nowhere to turn in order to purchase her new spells. The local Freeport Magicians would not welcome her. The Tower of the Spurned in Neriak would always allow her into its confines, but that would mean she would have to get past the Indigo Brotherhood, which, undoubtedly, had had every member memorize her face so that they could kill her on sight for treachery.</p>
<p>Emyrald began to ponder, sitting down and meditating to allow her thoughts to become more oriented toward the matter at hand, giving it her full, complete, and undivided attention.</p>
<p>She did know an invisibility spell. Perhaps it would work. But no, she was not skilled enough in the art of alteration to make her spell last long enough. Could she sneek and swim? No, she did not trust her feet to not make any noise… Perhaps the Brotherhood did not know of her yet. But that was too risky.</p>
<p><I>I could get a friend to help me, perhaps… But none of my Dark Elven friends are around the Eastern Commonlands, I can sense that.</I> Emyrald did not have any other option than to make do with her current spells. So she ventured to Befallen, a place where she could still learn from the enemies and battles that occurred there. The question still remained on her mind though: <I>How will I get into Neriak</I></p>


<p>Emyrald walked into the Undead palace known as Befallen. She readied her staff and began to chant a spell, seeking a target that she knew would be rushing her. But none came, and she lowered her guard and stopped her spell.</p>
<p>She walked in. The main hall was littered with bones, many of them freshly hacked. A lone ShadowKnight leaned against a fallen pillar. His sword gleamed, as if it was freshly polished, and his armor shined with a dark glow.</p>
<p>“Greeting, Brethren,” the ShadowKnight greeted her as soon as he noticed her. “What brings you here? Do you come for the knowledge and experience of Befallen, or is it that Innoruuk has bestowed you with a mission to clean these halls of these vermin, as he did with me?”</p>
<p>“I come of my own accord and business. We certainly do not share the same mission,” Emyrald replied in her icy monotone way.</p>
<p>“But surely you can do both at the same time, serve Innoruuk and gain the knowledge as well? There is nothing wrong with that, Brethren,” There was an odd smile on his face.</p>
<p>“I am not your “Brethren,” nor do I serve Innoruuk. Indeed, the Prince of hate has marred me in a way unspeakable, and I would gladly face final death before submitting to him and bowing over his head.”
<p>“A Spurned, then. Be that as it may, I hold no grudge against you for that. Each to his own.’</p>
<p>Emyrald’s red eyes gleamed with an icy look. “Spurned I am not. Innoruuk marred me, and I wept. I wept, and I took strength from the ocean of tears that I had made. It turned me resolute. It promised me vengeance against the Prince of Hate. The Lord of Oceans, Prexus, does not lie.”</p>
<p>“Prexus! A Dark Elf who worships Prexus! Hah! This is a first. And, undoubtedly, a last as well. I will slay you for the sake of Innoruuk, and will finish his work! He marred you, and I kill you!” the ShadowKnight raised his bloodthirsty sword above his head. Emyrald did not move. She realized that, if someone of this power wanted her dead, then it would be so, and would also be futile to resist. She closed her eyes and awaited her death.</p>
<p>But the sword never had a chance to fall.</p>
<p>“Let be, Vumelin!” a booming voice thundered across the halls. Behind the ShadowKnight, a Troll had appeared. It grasped the hilt of the blade and pulled it from ShadowKnight Vumelin’s grasp.</p>
<p>“She is a Dark Elf that blasphemes against Innoruuk, Troumph! She has no place here! Let me kill her!” Vumelin cried.</p>
<p>“Some do not think as we do. If we went and killed them all we would be hunted and killed ourselves. Control your temper, or I shall count you as insubordinate.” The Troll, apparently named Troumph, then turned to her. “What blaspheme does my friend Vumelin speak of?”</p>
<p>“Ask him yourself,” said Emyrald.</p>
<p>The Troll asked, and Vumelin explained, “She worships Prexus. No Dark Elf can worship Prexus!”</p>
<p>Troumph closed his fist. He then let it fly, and Vumelin was knocked onto the floor. Troumph went over, helped his friend up, and gave him back his sword. “Do not yell at your elder.” This was a surprisingly well-mannered Troll.</p>
<p>“You intrigue me.. What was your name? I am Troumph, by the way, and this is my friend Vumelin.”</p>
<p>“My name is for me to know. No one else needs to,” Emyrald monotoned. The Troll studied her, and was impressed by how well she hid her emotions. But the truth was, there were no emotions to be hidden. She did not fear this confrontation.</p>
<p>“But I told you mine, it is courtesy to follow suit,” the Troll was definitely interested in her.</p>
<p>“Emyrald DeLunar, of the Ma’rkoth family,” she said curtly.</p>
<p>“You, the daughter of the Detherean the High Priest? This bears telling to the King, indeed!” Vumelin said.</p>
<p>“Do not bother, Detherean has already fled Neriak, along with his family,” Emyrald said. It was obvious that this was news to the Dark Elves. </p>
<p>“Yes, that does bear ill fortune for Innoruuk, doesn’t it, Vumelin. But, nonetheless, this girl intrigues me.” Troumph turned to her. “Our Guild is called the Guardians of Innoruuk. You are welcome to join us. Indeed, I full heartedly support Innoruuk, as does Vumelin, but we are the only people that need to know who you are and who you worship. With us, you will be protected from all that may deem it wise to delay you on your quest. We are a Guild of honor, and protect the honor of all our members.’ Throughout Troumph’s speech, Vumelin staggered. He could not believe that Troumph was letting a blasphemer into the Guild.</p>
<p>“No,” came the single word from Emyrald’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Why, prey tell? I have told you that you need not worship him alongside us. But you intrigue me. Tell me, what did Innoruuk do to you that makes you despise him so?” Vumelin went to speak, but was silenced by Troumph’s wave of his hand. Emyrald considered for a moment, and decided it best to tell her story.”</p>
<p>She came to the end of her tale, which was remarkably done her in monotone fashion, and she could tell that she had touched the heart of Troumph. More than that, perhaps, she had won the respect of Vumelin, for how she had put up with so many trials.</p>
<p>“I see. But you say you despise Innoruuk. Wouldn’t then that be the first step toward worshipping him?” These were the type of questions Vumelin periodically asked while she was explaining her tale. She managed to fend off most of them, but occasionally they were so well aimed and perfectly timed that she had to recover before coming up with a logical explanation and continuing with her story.</p>
<p>Throughout the story, the Undead that Vumelin had previously slaughtered came back to “unlife.” But they didn’t bother anyone. Indeed, a menacing look from Troumph sent them running across the halls.</p>
<p>A few minutes after the story closed, Troumph again made his offer, but he based it more upon her history. He also made a key point: The Guardians of Innoruuk were welcomed in Neriak. Joining them would solve her problem with obtaining spells and new training.</p>
<p>It took her of thought to decide. Throughout this, Troumph and Vumelin sat by her, looking at her, pondering and in awe of her story, and not disbelieving a single portion of it. It was obvious to them now that she did not look too much like a Dark Elf, though her skin color, eyes, and hair were obviously Dark Elf. She did look much more like a High Elf with her features. The curse had begun to wear off after many years.</p>
<p>Emyrald finally spoke, “I will join you. Know that I do not intend to become a servant of Innoruuk. I could never do that. It is obvious, though, that I did not know of some facets of this world that you all indeed do.”</p>
<p>There was no leaping for joy, no ceremonies, just badge of office to use to get through the Neriak Guards. Emyrald had accepted their invitation of protection, and had sworn fealty to Troumph. She would honor that.</p>
<p>Now that she could purchase her new spells, she no longer had a need of hunting in Befallen. So she left and went to Neriak, bee-lined for the Tower of the Spurned, and bought her new spells. She trained, purchased Malachite, and then, wordlessly, summoned a Gateway to the Eastern Commonlands tunnel.</p>
