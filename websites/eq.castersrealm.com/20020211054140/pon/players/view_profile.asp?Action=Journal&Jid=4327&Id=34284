  <tr><td > </td></tr>
  <tr><td ><p> To get to the Estate of Unrest, one must pass through a wastland known as Dagnor's Cauldron.  There are several dangers of this land, the main one being the land itself.  Sharp drops, with sharper rocks are abundant, and one must constantly watch ones footing.  </p>
<p> Aventari, Gracchus and I made our way carefully across the barren terrain, and rising a steep incline spoted a small campfire, believing this to be another like the "Fab Four" we proceeded with less than due caution towards it.  What brought us abruptly to a halt was not so much the smell of goblins, but rather the arrows of goblins.  Blue, but virtually the same as their Butcherblock cousins the aqua goblins fired arrows down upon us.  Fortunatly they were not very good.  I returned fire as Aventari and Gracchus (both clad in plate) charged forward.  As the goblins put down their bows and drew steel, I did likewise.  </p>
<p> These goblins were quite powerful, and their weapons of above average quality (for brainless monsters at any rate) and seemed to be of the same make as those of the goblins of Butherblock.  However they fell to our steel, much as a tree falls to the axe of a woodcutter.  A ring that had been forged in the shape of running water I found on the hand of one of the goblins.  This ring had obviously been forged with greater care than the goblins could hope to ever acheive.  I resolved to explore this in more detail at a later date, right now I needed to speak to the monk in unrest.</p>
<p> A deep chill ran down my spine as we headed into the Estate.  Gracchus and Aventari seemed to deal with it better than I did, perhaps their training leans more towards that direction.  All over the now rotting garden beetles could be seen crawling, and the stench of rotting flesh was rival to that of Blackburrow.  In every dark corner could be seen animated carcasses, and other equally horrid constructs.  I needed to find this monk fast, to get out of here.  Speaking to some brave souls who had made a small camp near a still running fountain I learned this monk indeed was here, and could most likely be found behind the manor itself.  </p>
<p> We quickly took our leave as several rotting corpses threw themselves on the blades of the adventurers.  Walking through the remains of a probably once pleasant garden we dispached several of the multitude of beetles, and more than a few zombies and the like.  I spotted another group of adventurers along a wall a ways from us.  Urging my fellows forward I saw, to my dismay that they were not adventurers any longer, but undead soldiers.  Fortunatly the undead are not very bright, they did not see us.  However I did find the monk I was looking for. </p>
<p> As we walked past a gazebo a human sized skeleton jumped from the earth and began to attack us.  From its fighting style I knew immediatly this was the monk, now  a skeletal monk.  I had indeed caught up with the monk, however I was too late.  </p> 
<p> This monk would not have been much of a fight had it not been for the wandering "patrol" of other skeletons that happened to march past.  Perhaps they were following someone, at any rate they launched themselves into the fight with us as well.  We battled valiantly, however we were obviously no match for the undead.  Gracchus's lips were sore from praying, and Aventari's plate was beginning to look like a dented kettle.  Though Aventari was urging us to retreat both Gracchus and I stayed our ground until it was impossible to do so any longer.  Retreating through the garden maze we managed to loose all but a few of our skeltal persuers.  As we entered a long passageway that leads to Dagnor's Cauldron several new adventurers joined our fight, and led the skeletons back the way we had come, allowing us to pull back and lick our wounds </p>
<p> It appeared that Crushbone would have to be assaulted without inside knowledge </p>
