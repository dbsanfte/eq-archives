    This is a guide for bards. It will show you how to level to level 7 in about 2-3hours, depending on your balls=).<p>
<p>
Here's what you do:<p>
Ok, now that you've started your bard in Qeynos, you need to locate your guild (it's in South Qeynos). It is right by one of the zone, and has about 9 people in it. A man named Jusean will be outside. Go inside and give your note to the master (i forgot his name, check the note by right clicking it). Get your tunic equip it, then ask players if they can spare a few gold pieces. Most people won't even miss the gold, and will be happy to give you a few pieces. Use this gold to by your level one spell chant of battle (buy it in your guild). Memorize it, then set out to North Qeynos to fight monsters.*note ALWAYS sing. This song is great to practice singing with. So ALWAYS sing.<p>
I suggest fighting gnoll pups,decaying skeletons, and snakes because some people will buy 20 snake skins for a plat, or you can just sell them at a vendor for about a silver each *note* don't buy/sell from Tubal Weaver he has terrible prices instead find a shop called Ironforges/Jewelry Box and sell to Ziska Ironforge. Fighting gnoll pups is good because once in a while they drop belt pouches, backpacks(they are containers, right click to open them), they drop money, give good faction with the Qeynos folk, and they drop BEER! Beer is good, drink it as soon as you get it to raise your Alcohol Tolerance (beer raises strength but lowers int. but we bards can be dumb, right?=) Besides, the effects aren't permanent), and fight the decaying skellies because they drop rusty weapons and bone chips. You can sell/equip the rusty weapons (if they drop cracked staffs they sell for a plat and are great weapons for low levels), and you'll want to get the bone chips because necromancers will pay at least 1platinum for a stack of 20 chips, sometimes more. They also give good experience but be sure they are decaying, because there are a few regular skeletons in the North Qeynos zone that are level 5-6, and they will kill you on sight (KOS), unlike the decaying skeletons.<p>
Anyhow, when you reach level 2 and have 2-3 gold (or more) go back to your guild and get the song Chords of Dissonance. If you have a container, and some extra gold, buy your level 3,4 and 5 songs, and put them into your container. If you don't, and die, the songs will disappear. Don't need to memorize the chords yet, but you will a little later, so you may as well. Fight fire beetles but don't forget, if you're fighting one and another one walks by it will attack you too. Also don't forget there is a beetle named Queen Klicknik if she sees you fighting a beetle she will slaughter you (she is about level 7). When you reach level 3, memorize your level 3 song, Jaxan's Jig o vigor. You only need this song (at low levels) to run away from monsters to the guards because it replenishes stamina, and with stamina you can jump, and jumping makes you go faster.<p>
At level 3 you may want to go to Qeynos hills to fight giant rats, but be careful because wolves/bears/regular skeletons will KOS you and if you fight against bear and wolves and an NPC called Holly Windstalker or an NPC called Cros Treewind sees you fight them they will not hesitate to kill you.*note* Many high levels hunt these NPC's as well as a few others in the zone and by the time they can kill them, the things they drop are obsolete to them, so they will give you the weapon that Cros/Holly has (like worn great staff, Parrying dagger, Bronze short sword...). Fight to level 4 here by killing rats, snakes, and the occasional wolf. By the time you reach lvel 4 the fun starts!!!=)<p>
Mem your level 4 spell (i think it is Lyssa Locating song). *note* people will pay you to locate their corpses if you lead them there, a great thing.Then go back to Qeynos. Ask someone if they can cast a low level buff on you (like center or courage or maybe skin like wood) and start the fun. This is where you use Chords of Dissonance. Here's what you do:<p>
Get a good sword (like the bronze short sword I was telling you about) with a fast delay. Start singing your Chords song *note DONT SING AROUND PEOPLE NPC'S, THEY WILL TRY TO KILL YOU IF YOU DO* and go to a place with a lot of lower level monster. Get up close to them, and when the song hits them, run to another monster, then another then another. When you get about 5-10 monsters on you start meleeing them. This is why I had you get the buff. With each 'Train' of monsters you can get up to 2 bubbles of exp, and level 4 should be a quick and painless level. If you need another buff, don't hesitate to ask and if you get in over your head, run to the guards, but don't forget to stop singing chords. <p>
At level 5 you get Selo's Accelerando, a GREAT song, one of the best you'll ever get. This song makes you run fast, and at higher levels, faster than SOW (a druid/shaman spell).
The bad thing about this is that it doesn't work in Dungeons. But oh well. Now you can fight regular Skellies, and it is funner to group now. Here is a great idea: group with another bard at level 4-6. Have him play the chords and you play selo's. You can kite yellow-red monsters if you're careful. Sometimes the monster will resist the Chords and come at you anyways so run to the zone when this happens.<p>
You should now be killing Gnoll Scouts, Skellies (always con them first), regular gnolls at the entrance to BB, Bears, Wolves, rabid bears/wolves, large snakes, large bats, and grouping to kill the queen klicknik.*note* if you get her eyeball, sell it to a jeweler and they will pay handsomely for it. Make your way to level 6, get money, and prepare to leave Qeynos.<p>
Ahh... so you made level 6. Well, time to get the super song, Hymn of Restoration!!!! This is the bard's healing spell, which heals 3-25 hps(25 at level 50) a tick. Also buy your level 7,8,9,and 10 spells as you shouldn't be back to qeynos for a while. Say farewell to the klickniks, wolves, and gnoll pups, you are a good fighter now capable of many things. Here you have a few choices: either go to Blackburrow to fight Gnolls in a dungeon, or go to Karanas to fight there in an open field. Either way, you will almost have to group. People will even pay to get you into their group, but don't make them. You benefit the most from grouping, so it is ok. A suitable group would be 2warriors, you, 2clerics and a ranger (if in karanas so he can track). A great group is 1warrior, 2bards+you, 1cleric,and a ranger to track, or another warrior in BlackBurrow. The best group would be 4bards+you, and a ranger for karanas but another bard for BB=).Since you will be at level 6-7, you all can sing songs and get their benefits. That is why this is the best group. The bad thing is that you can't all sing the same song, only one song at a time. But it's ok, because with all of your buffs, you probably won't need to all sing hymn, or selo's. At this point, you may want to get some better armor, maybe patchwork, or bronze or even chainmail. Don't forget to train in percussion so you can play some songs better. When you reach level 9, the pssibilities are endless!!!:-)<p><p>
