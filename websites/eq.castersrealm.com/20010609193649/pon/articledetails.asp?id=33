<td width='80%'><font size="+2"><b>
<p align="left"></b></font>Here is a string of thoughts that I&nbsp;feel would
improve EverQuest. Remember, only an opinion, but these points would keep me
playing the game longer. This is a Post I wrote to my Companions. We have a
message board that we speak to each other on, and I&nbsp;have decided to share
it with all of you.</p>
<p align="left">Well, last night we all logged in and played in Lower Guk. Shaq
sent a tell, telling me she was in the Lord Rooms and there was no one there! I
got my WHOLE party up there and ran into Xezax once again. Shaq never saw him,
but that isn't the point. Xezax is a great and very friendly guy. The problem
is, he sat in that Lord Room from Friday night to Sunday night. He gave me a
bracer (like I said, a great guy) and we talked about the Lord and camping and
such. Since Friday, 4 Paladins that wandered into the Lord room all sent me
tells saying not to bother. 2 of them were 40+, no Ghoulbane. I just didn't have
the heart to play, and logged a little early. If people's days are numbered in
EQ, I figure mine shrunk a fair bit this weekend.</p>
<p align="left">On a side note, I have one piece of advice to give. DO NOT play
TFC on a shared 33.6 with a mild headache. :-) I think my worse score was 9/26.
Zube and Baba were running around everywhere, talking, fighting, winning. I just
couldn't keep up. My brain was pounding and trying to outsnipe a guy with 150
ping is nuts.</p>
<p align="left">I am going to send an email to Verant, just to ask a few
questions and give a few pointers. :-) This is the general gist of my problem.
Drop a comment?</p>
<p align="left">Example 1 : Every class has a defining set of equipment or Quest
that involves themselves with their class somehow. A good example is Warriors
and the Centaurs of SK. A Warrior could traverse the WHOLE world getting the
various components they require to complete their Quest. Once they have
completed their Quest, they have a complete set of Warrior only, crafted armour.
That is a brilliant idea that is the perfect Quest. There is only one problem.
Let's take the Helm for example. The Goblin Fire Totem is NO DROP. Perfect. The
Ruby is not. Great, half of the Quest is NO DROP. That is fine. You travel all
of the way to South Karana, give the Centaur a Totem and two rubies. Tada! You
are given a helm. A nice, pretty Crafted Helm. YOU worked for it, YOU get it.
But wait, it is a regular item? That is right, the Helm you just received can be
sold by any class to anyone that wants it. Although Warriors can use it, anyone
can sell it. Crafted armour IS a defining piece of equipment for Warriors.
Should a Warrior be able to buy HIS/HER crafted armour at the bank in Freeport?
NO! ALL crafted armour should be NO TRADE, NO DROP.</p>
<p align="left">Example 2 : Here is one near and dear to my heart. I am a
Paladin. :-) I have heard of a sword that is within the bowels of Guk that would
aid my cause of ridding the land of evil. An Evil Froggie Paladin(Let's not go
there, hehe) wields a sword so great, the undead crumple at its swing. I fight
my way up to level 30, feeling I have reached my best chance of getting it so
far. We fight to the Shin Lord's rooms and Lo and Behold! A player is already
there. A HIGH level player who is VERY nice and has stayed in that room for
almost 3 days. He talks with us, is very friendly and tells us he is a Cleric.
Pardon? Why would a Cleric want Ghoulbane? Well, his friend was up all night
camping for it, but now had to sleep so he is camping for him. I have FINALLY
reached level 30, 30 levels wanting to fight for a Paladin Sword. Don't hand it
to me on a platter, I want to fight for it. How can I fight for something that
now NEVER appears? And if it does, there were 6 lvl 40+ Paladin IN Upper Guk,
hanging around, waiting for their turn? Shouldn't a level 40 Pally be working
for the BSOF or Soulfire? Everyone talks of Verant making rare drops INCREDIBLY
rare now. So now, after the 12 of my friends and I have fought together, won
together, lost together, can finally come together to maybe help me get a blade
that would help define my character. I am the only Paladin in our peer group. We
don't really care what the rest of the world has. OUR group would like to Quest
together, to gain things that would make us better, heroic, etc etc. Ghoulbane
is my goal. If we had a Warrior, we would have no doubt just finished crossing
the whole world getting Crafted Armour. BUT, that Warrior would've been there,
handing in the parts and getting the armour, deserving every bit, bringing us
closer as a group. NO DROP, NO TRADE. MAKE Ghoulbane and any similar weapon NO
DROP NO TRADE. That would solve a large part of EverQuests problems. ONLY
Paladins could be there, slaying the Shin Lord, with their friends backing them
up. Yes, it took me a while to get to level 30, and yes, far too many Paladins
before me may have won Ghoulbane through combat or EBay, but what do they matter
to me or my friends? What purpose do we have if our reason for
&quot;Questing&quot; is gone?</p>
<p align="left">Good things : The Fire Totem in Sol A is NO DROP. Perfect, I
assume all of the other Crafted Armour components are as well. Why would Crafted
Armour not be?</p>
<p align="left">A few items of the Soulfire Quest are NO DROP. Good. The
Testimony of Truth Quest, some of the components are NO DROP. Good. MAKE
Soulfire, Ghoulbane, Fiery Avenger, Crafted Armour, Glowing Wooden Crooks,
Treant Staffs, Flowing Black Robes, etc etc all NO DROP, NO TRADE. These are
defining pieces of Equipment for a certain class. MAKE them defining. When a
character picks up that item from a MOB they have defeated, with their friends
standing around, they will be proud, happy, WANT to play more. When a character
sends a quick tell, saying they will pay 400plat for a Crafted Helm for their
twinked character because they are level 40 and have lots of money, that is no
good. Their secondary Warrior should have to go to Sol A, kill the Gob, get the
Totem, go to South Karana, buy the rubies, get the Helm, put it on, smile.</p>
<p align="left">Economy : This would not change the player economy much (And
what would happen to EBay?). It would change it, and maybe not make it as viable
at higher levels, but if Alchemy were fixed, Plate Armour introduced, player
made items that were better than Merchants, the economy would thrive. Banded
Armour is a must and is a perfect example. The only problem being, that it never
disappears or wears out etc. The market floods with it. IF items were actually
useful and needed continual purchasing, the market would work. Did you know
Chrysler could build a car that would run for decades, just use the right parts.
It would be expensive, but let's say you never had to buy one again. You gave it
your children when you die, etc. Cars wear out. People buy new cars. I bet my
Banded Armour, that I wore way back in level 15, is on some level 4 twinked
character because there is too much banded.</p>
<p align="left">Secondary Characters : This is a point I feel is a crying shame
with Verant. They have so many servers. UO was a different story, but EQ could
have worked this out much nicer. They have enough servers to give you ONE
character per server. None of this buyer/seller crap. For example, someone could
make a character for buying and selling that has 200 Charisma and is level 3.
They can get a steel breast plate for 300pp. WTF? ONE character per server. If
you want to start another character, go to a different server and get your
friends to come help. It would not eliminate all of the problems, but it would
stop a complete abuse of the system, that being a secondary character for a
specific purpose.</p>
<p align="left">Will I keep playing EQ? Not forever, but, because of the people
I play with, I will stay for now. I want to help everyone get the things they
want, gain xp and get new levels. Arc loves EQ and the people she plays with. It
has become a part of our lives(sometimes too large), but has on the whole been a
positive experience. What would we do with our evenings if we did not play? Have
to watch TV or something more useless than that. :-) As long as my friends are
there, I will continue to play. If they start to leave, I will be gone before
they finish telling us their intentions.</p>
<p align="left">To sum up :</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">ONE character per server.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">ALL &quot;defining&quot; Quest items and components, NO
    DROP, NO TRADE.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">ECONOMY : Make it work. Things should decay.</li>
