  <tr><td width='100%' class='db'><p>Jewelry, perhaps next to smithing, is one of the most expensive trade skills to raise but its the craft that nearly every enchanter pursues.  Tailoring may well be a pain in the butt, but it's nothing like the sheer amount of coin you have to pour out for jewelcraft, so, here's a strategy to help reduce the amount of cash an enchanter has to shell out, while possibly even making a profit where previously in jewelcraft it was nothing but paying platinum to learn.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This strategy applies mostly to non dark elven enchanters, but with some well placed illusions and occasional dodging, this can work as well for Teir'Dal too.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
First thing first:  Don't bother purchasing enchant silver until you are sixteen.  If you do go to purchase enchant silver at eight, make sure you pick up enchanter electrum as well.  Your time to benefit ratio is seriously bad if you journey all the way from Faydwer to Neriak, and then back to Faydwer eventually just to get enchant silver.  Every newbie enchanter wants to start in making magical jewelry as soon as they can probably because that was one of the main appealing factors of playing an enchanter.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Also, have yourself a 'jewelry' fund.  Set aside as much platinum as possible for your up and coming jewelry addiction as soon as you make your character.  Buy all your spells, buy a few necessities like a nice robe, a few MINOR int or mana bonus items, but save EVERYTHING else.  Hopefully if you do so you'll have yourself about 50-100 plat or so at 16.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
However, to actually start producing a good amount of jewelry you won't have enough cash until you hit at least 12, and if you wait until sixteen, this strategy will apply to the utmost.  Wait until sixteen.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When you hit sixteen journey to Firionia Vie and pick up breeze.  Then, head back to Faydwer with Enchant Silver, Enchant Electrum and Breeze in your spell book.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(Incidentally, strategies and recommendations are available on this site for picking up each of the above spells.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now I'm not a fan of hunting as an enchanter at this level on Faydwer, but you aren't here to hunt, you're here to make all kinds of jewelry.  Eventually when you get tired of doing this, head yourself back to Antonica, the hunting there is much much better.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, go up to the jewel shop in Felwithe, bind yourself at the jeweler's in Felwithe, the Kelethin jeweler is acceptable, but not great.  If time is an issue, then just use the Kelethin jeweler, as that is where you will be, otherwise, I preferred to use Felwithe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Purchase about 40 blocks of silver, and seven to ten of each gem type starting at the very bottom (Malachite) and heading up to Amber.   You'll only need seven per if you trained up to 21, if you just put the one point in (Which I recommend you doing) you'll need more of the low end stuff.  Don't worry about overbuying, all of the low end gems are but one or two gold a piece.  And any that you have left over you can just use when you move on to electrum.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now, once you have all your gems, and all your silver bars, head over to Kelethin, and sit on one of the lower lifts.  Begin enchanting your silver.  While you are enchanting, start shouting, slowly,
'Binding and breezing at lifts, tell me your lift and I'll meet you, donations appreciated, not
expected.'  You may be a person that has pride stinging them and not wish to say you are accepting donations, but do it! My ratio of making money while actually saying I would like donations was much higher than I was not.  At this point a lot of players are all twinked or playing new characters and they assume you are too.  For a person who has taken a character to sixty, if they start up an enchanter the one or two plat someone tips is almost not worth hitting the trade button.  It's only reasonable, thus make sure they know you would appreciate any donations offered.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Don't be mad if no one takes you up on it at first, even at poor hours there are always thirty or so people in great fay, and they are moving in and out at rapid speeds.  While you are shouting, keep enchanting and making jewelry.  Always keep your breeze on.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now, on an older server with a slightly inflated economy I have made anywhere between 10 platinum to 60 platinum an hour breezing and binding at the lifts.  15-30 is about average, rarely breaking above fifty.  Spending a whole hour doing that is really a waste of time in most people's eyes, as you can almost make that in the field, not to mention experience and skill benefits.  However, jeweling is one of the very few trade skills that you can do in the field, as an enchanter you can even enchant in the field.  Thus, it's not entirely reasonable to be enchanting while hunting (Look at the mana costs of the enchants, at sixteen you'll be paying at least a bubble per enchantment.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Since you are gonna be wasting your time and mana doing this anyway, you might as well sit in GFay and bind and breeze.  Doing this, now once you get to jaspers and ambers, you can begin auctioning off your wares while you are sitting there and making jewelry, and also while you are binding and breezing! Amber, Star Rose, and Jasper are really the only pieces of jewelry at Silver-Electrum level that are worth making and selling.  Star Ruby and such also sells for an incredible amount of cash, but have faith that you don't want to waste your money on them, come back to those when you are a master.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Once amber goes trivial, it's back to the drawing board.  Head back to Felwithe and purchase up as many electrum bars as possible (They run about two and a half platinum a piece, forty bars being 60 platinum)  Now, purchase up as many hematite as possible is necessary, but not more than your bars.  40 or so is good, maybe more, depends on taste.<br>
<br>
The trivial jump from silver-amber to electrum-hematite is well over 20, thus you'll be making these awhile.  These have no value on the player driven market, so you don't even necessarily have to bother enchanting them, the skill improvment is the same no matter what as is the resell value, only players care whether an item is magical or not, vendors don't.  However, keep yourself in Kelethin, and keep shouting offering breezes and binds (Remember to say donations are welcome, and also say you will meet the player at the lift of their choice)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Using this strategy my downtime was immensely lowered while making jewelry, and moreover my loss in a trade skill compared to the resale values was reduced to about 3/4.  Spend 100 platinum, you emerge with 75, spend 75, you emerged with just under 50, and likewise down the spiral.  This is an INCREDIBLE return rate for a low trade skill, ask anyone who has started blacksmithing, the first few levels of blacksmithing you basically slap down 150 platinum and don't see any of it back again until you start making banded.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As an enchanter it will be possible for you at this level to get your skill to a good 90 range or so, all for that initial 50-100 platinum, which is a great tradeoff for then being able to make incredible pieces of jewelry that sell for 100-200 platinum a piece.  Also, you'll be making lots of buddies and breeze and bind addicts in Faydark who will be seeking you out for future business.  All around, this strategy is an absolute must for would be enchanter-jewelers.
