<td width='80%'>
<p>I was never one to bitch and complain too much, especially when nothing could
be done, but after spending a relatively long time in Cazic-Thule, I felt
compelled to vent. :)</p>
<p>Well, being a 30th level paladin wearing full bronze, I decided that is was
time to acquire myself some new armor. I thought getting ruby would be the last
time I would have to worry about armor for my character. So off I go to Cazic.
Oh was I in for a rude awakening. I spent 40 IRL days in Cazic, in an attempt to
just get one piece of ruby armor. I have failed. All I got for my trip was a
level and a lizard cloak and about 100 PP - the last 3 things I was shooting
for. The way I figure, I can always go get money and XP somewhere else, like the
Rathe Mountains...in any case I had never been so agitated in a long time. What
angered me? I shall tell you:</p>
<p><b>1. People</b></p>
<p>I have never seen so many greedy people in one place in my entire life. 70%
of them could not even use the damned armor. I got so tired of seeing verbal
wars over OOC and shout I didn't even have the OOC/Shout turned on for the last
20 days I was there. There were those that tried to be honorable when it came to
the named, but they were rare. The biggest problem? Mages. They would be grouped
up, and they would do nothing but sit there and wait for the named to spawn then
while the group that was up in the loot order was fighting it, they would nuke
the hell out of it, loot it, then go back to sit down. I could always tell if
they got something because you would see &quot;Ruby Greaves - 1400 PP&quot;
right after the named was killed. This caused a lot of problems, and guides
would show up on a regular basis. It got so bad one night they made the zone off
limits for 2 hours.</p>
<p>I have always been somewhat of a leader, and I normally kept track of the TR
loot order while in there. On several instances, 38-40th level mages would come
in...alone..and demand to be put into the loot order, while there were already
4-5 other full groups waiting their turn. When I would tell them
&quot;Ummm...no.&quot; they would take it anyway, and the bad thing about it was
there was nothing anyone could do but watch helplessly as the spawn you had been
waiting for for 4 hours was getting nuked from some unknown source. I felt so
sorry for all the 30+ rangers there, still wearing banded. This one 37th level
bard wearing FULL steel, wielding a Staff of Withering, charmed our named once,
and we could not attack it, she made it come down to the Avatar room where her
party was and they killed it, because they were bored waiting for the avatar to
spawn (40 minutes later they could not handle the Avatar and zoned it, killing
about 17 people in the process). The bad thing about it was I had been playing
16 hours that day and it was finally my turn to loot...the Templar dropped the
greaves and since everyone in that party already had them, they let their wizard
take them, who said he was going to keep them for his 6th level paladin. On a
regular basis High level warriors, or casters would come in and make themselves
invis on the throne, and kill the named before anyone had a chance to get up
there, many of these warriors were already wearing full crafted armor...the
stories go on...</p>
<p><b>2. The adopted party loot order</b></p>
<p>Pathetic. It was not based off of who needed the item the most, but off of
who had been in the party the longest. I would play for 8 - 12 hours some days
and NEVER even get a chance to loot a named. I would always end up last in the
order, and by the time it even remotely got close to me, the others would have
gotten what they wanted and left, causing me to have to find another party, only
to have the same thing happen...over and over again. It is a very frustrating
cycle. So I made a new one...when I led I was the one that looted the named, and
I would tell the group what it was. If you did not have the item and could
actually use it, then you rolled a d20, the highest number won the loot. If you
were a mage or a class that could not use the item, then too bad...you were at
the back of the bus. This worked very well...and it made everything a lot more
worthwhile...if you don't get the ruby, who are you going to blame? The dice? I
ended up handing out 8 pairs of ruby greaves over the 40 days...I never got any,
I just couldn't roll a high number to save my life...but that is the way it
goes. One guy sold his greaves for 1200 PP because he didn't like the way they
looked with his steel breastplate. Jeez...since when did the monsters give a
damn what you looked like?! ::shakes head::</p>
<p>Here is one instance that happened on the 40th day in Cazic that caused me to
pack up my stuff and leave:</p>
<p>4am, there were two parties in the TR. I had been there since noon (luckily I
had the weekend off) bouncing around various groups without success. I finally
found a good party of good and honorable players who wholeheartedly supported my
Random Dice Roll Method of loot order. We had been together as a group about 5
hours, everyone had greaves that could wear them but me, which meant the next
pair of greaves would go to me. It was us and another group who had been there
about 2 hours. They were up on the named. They could not handle the Templar and
zoned. We killed the Templar and I looted it...behold! Ruby Greaves, but being
the honorable Paladin Party Leader I decided that it belonged to the other
group, since it was in fact their turn. My party, (Made up of all REAL rangers,
clerics and paladins) agreed. When they returned they automatically accused us
of kill stealing before I could even explain, ignoring the abuse I gave their
leader the greaves. I received not one thank you. Well it came our turn, and
about 40 minutes later the Templar spawned again. Over this time they lost their
ranger (who left with a pair of new ruby greaves) and gained a 35th level
wizard, which gave them a total of 2 mages a cleric and a shaman. While we were
organizing our plan of attack, they pulled the Templar (along with two gorillas,
a justicar, a zealot and a fanatic) and try as we could, we lacked the fire
power to out point them, but after the Templar went down we kept fighting - in a
vain attempt to help them. The shaman looted the Templar in the middle of combat
and I looked up to see all of them gone. It was just us and this huge train. In
the end I lost 3 party members and zoned with 5 points left, even after LoH. I
came through the zone to see the shaman sitting there with her new ruby
greaves...my ruby greaves. At this point I had had enough and asked her is she
liked wearing my ruby greaves. After a few curt words she accused me of having
&quot;Ruby Fever&quot; and that if I was not careful my greed would consume me.
LOL I then told her that I could have cared less about the damned armor, but
what I cared about was their dishonorable group who went out of order after we
gave them their greaves from the last named spawn, stole what was rightly ours,
and in the process leaving us to clean up their mess, which killed 3 of my
people! She just laughed and said &quot;SOW is a good thing&quot; and &quot;If
you apologize to me, I will think about giving your group SOW so you all won't
die so fast&quot; I told her to &quot;Kiss my ass&quot; and made sure all my
group had their bodies back and left. My group pleaded with me to stay, but I
had had enough. 3 days later I got a tell from someone I didn't even know
telling me that the female shaman was back in the TR, without any greaves (or
pants for that matter) asking &quot;25 shaman looking for group...my legs are
cold&quot;. Nobody would take her, and it seemed word had gotten around about
what happened. It seems she sold the greaves for 1400 PP and figured she could
seduce her way into getting some more...which brings up the point of men playing
females just so they can get free hand-outs, but that is another story for
another time.</p>
<p>There were several other minor things that really annoyed me, but those were
the two main ones...all in all, in 40 days I spent in Cazic - I accomplished the
following:</p>
<p><u>Good Things:</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gained a level</li>
  <li>Made 104 PP from FS weapons</li>
  <li>Gained a Lizard Scale Cloak</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Bad Things (at least to my point of view)</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Died 23 times</li>
  <li>Watched 12 party members get an assorted piece of ruby...9 of them
    casters. (Not including the 8 I gave away while I was party leader using the
    dice roll loot order.)</li>
  <li>Had 6 named lizards stolen from my party by High level
    casters/warriors/bards.</li>
  <li>Added 7 names to my ignore list</li>
  <li>Had a pair of greaves stolen from me.</li>
  <li>Smoked 12 cartons of cigarettes and drank approx. 15 pots of coffee and 22
    crown and cokes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure there are other minor small things, but I think you get the
point...you make the call..did I benefit from this trip to Cazic to get better
armor? Considering the fact that I still don't have any, I would say no. I could
care less about the armor if I had fun...but do you think I had any fun?
Ummm...no. So you know what I did? I left. I am going to get Soulfire, some
crested or mithril armor, then come back to Cazic and say &quot;Remember me? Oh
yeah! You want me to help you get what?&quot; I am going to get ruby armor and
give it away to the hard working people who have been there for days, but kept
getting shafted.</p>
<p>&quot;Ruby Fever&quot; is a disease for sure, a disease commonly called
Greed, and I am proud to say to this date I am not infected and never will be
for that matter. Someone told me once that I am not greedy enough to get
ruby...and they were exactly right...I am not.</p>
<p>It all comes down to this: There are several people in EQ who have really
pathetic lives, lives so devoid of attention and success that they feel they
must be the center of attention and be the most powerful person in an on-line
Role Playing Game...people who don't care about surviving, or accomplishing
goals/quests, or role playing, people who don't care about the things this game
was really created for - these people only care for one thing - themselves. All
they care about is &quot;Hey look at me and what I have that you don't!&quot;
They wallow in the adulation of newbies like pigs in slop, hence all the
pathetic over-twinking. It's these kind of people that make me sick, but on the
other hand, I have to laugh, because I know that if EQ all of a sudden did not
exist anymore...I wouldn't mind, because my bills are paid, I live in a nice
place and drive a nice car and a good job. I wouldn't mind because I am secure
enough in myself as a person that these 40-50th level morons who eat, sleep and
shit EQ would not bother me (present company not included of course, you guys
know what I mean. :) ). I wouldn't mind because I could always find a book to
read, a picture to draw or a story to write...I could always get together with
my friends and play AD&amp;D, knowing the whole time that these people would be
like a crack fiend without a fix in 2 weeks. I promise you...ever
since I adopted this attitude, I have had sooo much fun. It doesn't bother me as
much anymore if I die, or get a kill stolen. Give it a try. :)</p>
