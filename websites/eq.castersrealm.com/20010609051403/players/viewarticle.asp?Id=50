	<p>The silence reigned for a few minutes. Then a scream.</p>

	<p>“<b>Dirk!</b>” And with that Yakov rushed up to the platform. He drew his sword, then dropped it as the insanity of the scene struck him. <b>Black</b> fires were burning all over the platform. But that was impossible. He realized suddenly that instead of the insane heat he should be feeling, the black flames gave off the chill of the grave.  Of the shadowknight, there was only a black, charred outline where his body had been. And over, next to a hut, huddled in pain....was....</p>

	<p>“Ha...heh...ha...Isn’t pretty, is it?” Dirk’s voice was a pained rasp. He seemed in good shape, though. </p>

	<p>“You....how are you alive? He should have killed you!”</p>

	<p>“Ha....ha....that amateur? No, Yakov...I did that. He’s gone. But....” The Black Elf pointed down. A group of dark elf stragglers were still formed up there. “We’ll have....to get them...or they’ll get away.”</p>

	<p>“Dirk.....how? Why? How do you know how to do that?” Yakov’s mind was paralyzed.</p>

	<p>“Does it matter at the moment? It’s not necromancy, don’t worry. We...” Dirk broke off coughing. “need to get them.”</p>

	<p>And the Black Elf rose up, slowly, wincing with pain. “No, Dirk. I’ll take care of it. Stay here and grab the healers.” Yakov yelled for support, pointed down towards the group of enemies, and rushed away. He suddenly realized that although normal dark magic (necromancy) gave off a feeling of corruption, the dark fires had a dreadful cleanness to them. He shivered.</p>

	
	<p>About ten minutes later Yakov leapt off the platform and scanned the area. The dark elves were saddling their drakes, while the youngest protected the older ones.  The oldest kicked off and left. He grinned evilly. </p>

	<p>Yakov rushed up to his victims and decapitated the first he saw with a wild swing. Then another was rushing at him.</p>

	<p>Slash! Parry!</p>

	<p>SHINK! and the woman was howling in pain on the ground, her body mutilated and dying.</p>

	<p>The third tackled him. He and his foe rolled on the ground, swords useless. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw an archer aiming her bow at him. He braced himself, and watched as her bow raised and lined up with his heart.</p>

	<p>Then a hiss, thock ! and the archer dropped her bow and was shrieking like a banshee on the ground as the poison on Jesica’s shuriken burned away her mind. She was dead in thirty seconds.
Yakov and his foe traded punches, quickly, until the dark elf raised a dagger from his belt and plunged it down at the ranger’s eye. Yakov desperately grabbed the dark elf’s arm, the knife a mere centimeter from his eye. He twisted it, the dark elf howled as his wrist was fractured. Then Yakov hurled the enemy from him, flipped up, and ran him through. All around him, the rearguard was being swept from the field. A few escaped. Not many.  “Close one, cousin.”</p>

	<p>“Definitely. But you were doing all right.”</p>

	<p>“I certainly hope so. Let’s bury this trash and get out of here.”</p>

	<p>Another five minutes later, Yakov gaped open-mouthed at the scene before him. Dirk was standing on a ramp, surrounded by Paladins.</p>


	<p>Dirk stood tall, his body masking the pain he was in. “WHAT?”</p>

	<p>“You, Black Elf, are a disgrace. You just showed your true colors.” The speaker was High Knight Mersat Car’thos. A guy who Dirk had never been on good terms with. But this? Why?....</p>

	<p>“B...but...I....”</p>

	<p>“Silence! You are coming with us, accursed. I declare you a Fallen Knight, and sentence you to death tomorrow in Felwithe before all you have betrayed.”</p>

	<p>“What did he do that was so wrong!?” Jesica screamed.</p>

	<p>“Leave Dirk be, you bas-!” Yakov yelled.</p>

	<p>“Silence! Inferior elves, you obviously can’t tell the good from the bad! Servants of Tunare? Ha!”
Mersat gazed at the two with arrogant contempt. “If you are truly her servants, then you shall aid her by aiding me to destroy this abomination! He should have been executed the day he came here! His mother’s blood is a taint on all true elves! No, he could never help us, and now it is proven!”</p>

	<p>“Shut up, you $@~ !” Jesica was on the verge of slicing this guy’s throat. “The only traitor here is you!” </p>

	<p>The High Knight and the ranger exchanged a quick and offensive dialogue. For the sake of the young ones, the exact content is not known by any teller. Occasionally, the rogue screamed obscenities at the High Knight.</p>

	
	<p>Dirk had had enough. “Jes....stop.” Dirk sighed. “Well, High Knight, I shall come with you.” Dirk surrendered his sword and accepted the chains placed on him. He sighed, and was lead off by the swarm of Paladins, leaving Jesica and Yakov to stare at one another wordlessly.</p>



	<p>That night.........</p>

	<p>Dirk the Black Elf sat alone in his cell. No guard had been posted, and he wondered why. Then one came walking down, a cruel smile on his face. A Paladin...? He’d never seen this guy before.</p>

	<p>“Only a couple more hours for you to live, scum.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, scum, is it?”</p>

	<p>The guard reached in with his arm, and unwrapped a whip.....”High Knight Mersat gave me orders you were to be tortured. Let me assure you, I am a master of the craft.”</p>

	<p>Dirk gritted his teeth. “Coward! Come in here with that, and we’ll see who’s better!”</p>

	<p>“Oh, really?” He lashed, again, and again.....and again....when a footstep was heard. A figure dressed in black came walking down, no, two. </p>

	<p>“Leave us with the prisoner.”</p>

	<p>“You aren’t from this garrison! Guards! Guards!” The paladin drew his sword. </p>

	<p>The two figures undid their cloaks, and Yakov and the wood elf from the tavern game were standing there. “Leave him or die.” Yakov rasped.</p>

	<p>“Ha! Let’s see how you do when it’s two on two!” A second paladin appeared.</p>

	<p>A short and bloody fight ensued. The wood elf girl was using a stave, and lashed out with it between spells. Yakov was using his normal sword, and he was definitely better then the opponent he faced. Dirk could only watch helplessly. After a short melee, Yakov ran through the other swordsman.</p>

	<p>“To hell with this!” the impaled paladin said. His form darkened, and thrust itself off Yakov’s sword. Then a blinding explosion. After it cleared, a large, winged humanoid thing stood there in his place. It was huge, at least seven feet tall. It had a skull-like face, bony, and filled with teeth. Its hands ended in claws. It looked positively obscene. The second paladin also became one of these creatures, then both faded away. </p>

	<p>“Something is up.” the wood elf said. “Those....aren’t from here.”</p>

	<p>Yakov ground his teeth. “I can’t break these locks. Jes!” His cousin appeared and undid the bonds on Dirk’s wrists and legs. “Dirk. Can you hear me?”</p>

	<p>“Of...course I can hear you. I’m beat up, but I’m not dying,” the paladin replied. “Get out of here before they accuse you too! Tell the King I had nothing to do with this.....”</p>

	<p>“I’m not leaving this room without you. Didn’t you see those things? Something funny is going on.” Yakov handed Dirk his weapons, and turned to the passage, guarding while Dirk donned his equipment. “Where are we going?”</p>

	<p>“We’re going to the throne room, Yakov.” Yakov winced. “If there are demons loose in here, we can’t leave the King alone.” Dirk finished, then waited patiently. A scream rent the still air.</p>

	<p>The four faced one another wordlessly. A second passed. Two screams. A slight scent of battle drifted down to the passageway. Explosions, screamed incantations, and above all a dreadful howling.
The party faced one another for another second, then raced out of the dungeons and into the main castle.</p>


	<p>Inside, it was chaos. The room was dark, but one could see that blood stained the richly laid marble a dull crimson. Four fallen paladins lay next to a door that led into the King’s room. Dirk started at a yell from the throne room and ran up to the door and burst it open. The door slammed behind him, without his permission to close. Yakov raced up to it and pulled. No good! Their friend started. The wood elf froze. “Guys...? Was that you...? Guys?”</p>

	<p>“No.” The voice was a snarl. “It wasn’t.” The lights flared up. A chilling laughter filled the room, as the threesome looked frantically around. Four skull-demons appeared in the dim light.</p>
“Ha...Humans taste so nice.”</p>

	<p>“Well, we aren’t humans! So go away!” Yakov said calmly.</p>

	<p>“Elf will do.” The huge demon leapt at Yakov while his compatriots followed suit with his companions.</p>


	<p>The torchlight flickered in the throne room. Dirk felt a chill as he registered what was going on. Mersat stood in the room, facing off with King Thex himself. A few paladins were already dead, and Thex was holding his sword in both hands. He gasped as he saw Dirk rush into the room.</p>

	<p>“So, Black Elf, have you come to assist your master?”</p>

	<p>“Master? Be serious, milord. He’s an enemy of the state. And therefore, he’s mine as well.”</p>

	<p>“So, more fun, eh?” Mersat grinned viciously. </p>

	<p>“M....Mersat?”</p>

	<p>“No. Not Mersat.” A blinding flash lit the room with fell lights. When the flash cleared, Mersat was gone. In his place stood something from a madman’s nightmares. Seven feet tall, the thing radiated evil. The legs were wrapped around with black rags, a fact for which Dirk was profoundly grateful. It’s torso resembled a human ribcage on the outside, with dark red flesh visible through the gaps. It’s hands had elongated into skeletal blades. But it was the head that truly frightened the Black Elf. It was like some great tentacle, but for the red eyes and gaping maw that adorned it’s stubbed top. It snarled. The Paladin was confused, until he realized it was actually speaking. <i> A Reaper....</i></p>

	<p>“Ha...ha....ha. Pathetic. I’ve been waiting for you, child.”</p>

	<p>“Sorry to have kept you waiting so long, with so little time to live!” And Dirk raised his hand. It filled with blazing purple energy and blasted the abomination back. “Get the King out of here!” The paladins obeyed and began to retreat.</p>

	<p>But the thing grinned as it rose. “I am Melkor. Nice to see you’ve been keeping up practice.” It howled, a sound reminiscent of a human shriek, and gripped one of the retreating paladins. It’s awful hands inflicted massive wounds on it’s victim, and as the high elf screamed in agony, Melkor held him up to it’s mouth and drank deeply from the blood pouring out. As Dirk watched in horror, the monster threw the screaming man into a wall, leaving a faint red trail. Or maybe that was his vision. He also realized that every wound on the creature his attack had dealt was gone. The creature held it’s own hand up and blasted at Dirk with a precise duplicate of Dirk’s own attack. </p>

	<p>WHAT?! That’s....impossible!</p>


	
	
	<p> Yakov parried first one attack, then another. The claws of his foe were hard as steel. Each attack sounded like a smithy collapsing. He shuddered, then laughed at his enemy. “You need practice!”</p>

	<p>“Oh, really? Then try this!” Blasts of darkness surrounded the ranger. When it stopped, the demon gaped. Yakov was unharmed! The ranger slashed the demon’s arm off, while it howled in pain, then Yakov leapt back.</p>

	<p>“My turn!” Yakov grinned and swung his sword upwards. Lightning blasted through the roof and surrounded the ranger in a sphere of electricity. Then it all coalesced into a beam and smashed into the demon like the hand of the gods themselves, with Yakov rushing in in it‘s wake. You can guess what happened to the demon.</p>

	<p>As Yakov lowered his blade, he observed the carnage going on in the hall. His cousin flipped her daggers around, placed one in each hand, and spun like a whirlwind around on the tips of her feet. Anything she hit got very, very hurt very fast. The wood elf was busy blasting back demons from her vantage point ten feet in the air. He grinned as he realized they were going to win. As the last demon dropped to the floor, dead, Jesica drew out her lock picks and began to work on the locks.</p>


	
	<p>Dirk gaped. “My abilities are inherited! How....in...h--l did you do that?”</p>

	<p>The monster laughed. “It’s in your blood, Black Elf. And it certainly was in your mother’s. I killed her for it.”</p>

	<p>Dirk spoke no word, but shrugged his sword off his shoulder and rushed screaming incoherent insults at the thing. His vision was red. The two fought, back and forth. It was the stuff nightmares are     made of. The paladin was being fueled by his own rage, and the monster was undead, so while both bit into one another’s bodies, and blood was falling all over, neither paid any attention at all to their wounds. Finally, driven beyond his reluctance, Dirk leapt back with an animal scream. He raised his hands and shouted something. Blackness filled the room, and blue flares of energy smote the creature. It laughed contemptuously.</p>

	<p>“She suffered dreadfully, you know. Screaming for mercy within five minutes. It was lovely.”</p>

	<p>Dirk couldn’t take it anymore. He ran at the horror, and it blocked his attack smoothly with it’s claws. Then it’s own black magic flared out, smashing the paladin into a wall. He grunted, and focused on the creature’s form again, but it was already running at him. He blocked it, but the force of the rush knocked him onto the ground again. He desperately parried attack after attack. Then his sword was out of his hands, flickering in the black firelight several feet away. It laughed, a sound like bone snapping.
It raised it’s huge claw-blade, and would have killed Dirk had not it stumbled under the force of a kick from his previous, still living victim. The high elf never screamed nor made a noise as Melkor finished him off. But it had lost. Dirk had sword in hand.</p>

	<p>“Well, well. You aren’t a puppy anymore, it seems.”</p>

	<p>“........”</p>

	<p>“Well, that’s enough for today, little elf. I’ll be back....” and the creature faded away, leaving Dirk only to stare as the door burst open and his friends emerged. They stared in shock, at the traces of the battle, at Dirk, and the dead paladins on the floor. </p>


	<p>About five hours later, Dirk had explained to the King and his friends. He stalked off to sleep in a room in the Inn. The King would decide over his case tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Yakov Shadeleaf was confused. He didn’t get what was going on, why, or how. Oh well. Time to pay his friend a visit. He headed to the Inn room, and listened at the door. He was astonished to hear the sounds of sobbing. He knocked. “Dirk?”</p>

	<p>“Go away!” </p>

	<p>“It seems we’ve had this conversation before.”</p>

	<p>“Oh....well...come in..”</p>

	<p>As Yakov came in, he heard a sizable barrage of invective launched at life, the universe, and everything. “Can we talk about stuff?”</p>

	<p>“What did you have in mind?” The Black Elf had a glass of wine next to him, and he didn’t look too happy.</p>

	<p>“Everything.”</p>

	<p>“I see. You want to know what’s going on, no?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, as a matter of fact I do.”</p>

	<p>“Well then.....” They talked for a while.</p>


	
	<p>In Neriak, Xedri Nightshade lay on a pallet, recovering from the battle and the disastrous defeat. Her wounds were awful, and it had been a hard thing to save her injured leg without more serious measures. But she was recovering, slowly. She heard a call for her, and painfully limped to the council chamber. </p>

	<p>The Guildmaster was waiting for her. “You have a mission, Nightshade.”</p>

	<p>“Yes?” She tried to keep the pain out of her voice.</p>

	<p>“The Black Elf is a disgrace to our race. In addition, he has foiled the latest attack on Kelethin. You are to join a group of assassins we are mobilizing, find the Black Elf....”</p>

	<p>“...and kill him?” Xedri tried to keep the hesitancy she felt from showing as well. She’d never agreed with all the methods and practices of her race, and she’d nearly been executed last time she showed her opinion.</p>

	<p>“Exactly. And all his companions. We have a Reaper working on this. Here he is.”</p>

	<p>A shape formed out of the darkness. It was Melkor. It snarled at her. “You really think this little girl can help me?” </p>

	<p>The Guildmaster raised his hand, and offered a decanter of red liquid to the Reaper. Xedri shivered. “Yes, we do. You have an understanding of this target’s attacks, and she shows some promise. Besides, with the information you have given him about the assassination of his mother, he will be after you. You will lure him into recklessness, and we hope that his companion Shadeleaf will be occupied with her.”</p>

	<p>“S....Shadeleaf?” Xedri stammered. Shadeleaf was infamous in Neriak. He had defeated the Emperor of Crushbone in a one-one on duel, which had resulted in Neriak necromancers having to raise the Emperor and the death of their Ambassador. “What does he have to do with me?”</p>

	<p>“We believe he was your attacker. The eyes, in particular, tell a great deal. He wants to finish you, Xedri. Show him no mercy. He will not show you any.”</p>

	<p>“B...but he let me live!”</p>

	<p>“He did that to terrify you. To paralyze an existing warrior can be more useful then death.”</p>

	<p>Melkor grinned horribly. “Shadeleaf is up to you, girl. But the Black Elf is mine. I want more.....”</p>

	<p>“More what?” Xedri was truly scared and confused. The idea that she’d crossed swords with Shadeleaf and lived was disconcerting, not to mention slightly cool.</p>

	<p>“More......power. That’s what.” </p>

	<p>A cacophony of  chilling laughter resounded through the chamber. </p>
