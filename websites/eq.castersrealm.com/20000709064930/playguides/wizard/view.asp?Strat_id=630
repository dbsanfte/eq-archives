    PvP Defense is the best way to live. <p>
Most of this applies to people who play on the real pvp servers not the carebear wannabe ones. =0
<p>
Most wizards think they could take a magician hands down because there dd is so much better.  Well they are sooo wrong.  A wizard would probably say that if he rooted your pet he could then blast you wiz to mag.  This is true and a wizard would more than likely win if you didnt have a pet.  Sure verant nerfed the heck out of pets and they dont do much dmg in pvp.  My lvl 29 fire pet does about 15 dmg a hit in pvp :(  Pets do have an advantage they intterupt the caster and can make the difference between a win and a loss.  But if a wizard roots your pet, there is a way around this.  
<p>
Strategy #1 <p>
This is how to keep those wizard casters from ruining your day.<P>  
(I can not stress enough for any pvp oriented magician, necro or other, to use Pumice)  If you do not know Pumice looks like a Greater light stone and has 5 charges of Nullify Magic.  You can buy this in Erudin in the Vials of Vitality for about 17 pp. each. Anyway if the wizard roots your pet target your pet and right click on the pumice.  This will take root right off and then your pet preceeds to beat on the poor little wizard.  Then you can follow up with your highest Direct Damage without fearing him intterupting you.  If he roots your pet again you can always nullify magic your pet again and blast the wizard. Buff up for pumice too.  When you buff up cast a low lvl dmg shield on yourself then cast see invis, now put all of your real buffs on starting with your fire,cold sv spell, phantom/leather/chain/plate line, and then your shielding.  Now if someone snares you, target yourself and pumice this will take off snare and no other buffs.  Works for other debuffs too.  Doing this can mean making it to the zone or dying miserably in the dirt.  Even if you do-not pk pumice is great in dungeons when an enchanter npc charms your monk in the group.  With Pumice target the monk and start taking off his buffs till you take charm off.  This can save yo but many of times.  Btw Keep pumice hotkeyed in one of your hotkey boxes.
<p>
Strategy #2 <p>
Keep that lesser dd memm'd at all times.
In a good fight you dont want any hurtful spells being cast on you, so if he/she starts casting a dd cast your lvl 8 shock-o-blades.  Casting time is quick and it will knock your target back intterupting him.  (It is possible to regain after getting hit but most of the time they wont)  This can work really well if your pet is beating on him too.  After he is intterupted and a pet is beating on him try hitting your target with a shock of spikes.  This will take longer to cast but will do more dmg and also intterupt.  Then you can safely land your highest dmg spells on he/she without getting hit.  
<p>
Strategy #3
Fight or Flee? <p>
When someone attacks you, A. Should you fight, or B. Should you Flee.  Sometimes you you cannot afford to stay and fight and if you are attacked by an enchanter it's best to flee.  An enchanter is tuff to beat and they have some of the meanest pk spells.  If you are attacked by an enchanter it is best to sick pet, gate, and come back for revenge later.  If there is more than one person that atks you flee is the best thing.  Running is probably better than gating, if you run they will follow and they cant cast spells while running after you, unless they are a bard.  If they snare you pumice it off.  If they root you pumice it off, keep running till you zone or have enough room to gate safely.
<p>
Strategy #4
To Dispell or not to dispell. <p>
If a Wizard engages you it's probably better not to dispell him and save your pumice for root.  Here is what is best for using pumice offensively.
Wizard-Pumice him when he runs taking off sow etc.<p>
Druid-Pumice him the most taking off sow,regen,buffs.<p>
Cleric-Most clerics dont pk.<p>
Shaman-Take em all off.<p>
Enchanter-Take em all off.<p>
Tank classes- Tanks pk in groups.  Flee.<P>
Necro-same as Wizard.<p>
Bard-Dont bother. High lvl bards are awsome pk's<p>
Tank classes- if they have sow or any other buffs.
<p> Also pumice will take off other debuffs such as Tashan/i/a , snare, Cascading Darkness(?), Any magic related Dots such as Heart flutter, Choke, Drones of Doom.
<p>
Well there ya go that is the Low down.  If you think that a higher lvl pk is buffing the lower lvl ones it's best to take all of there enchantments off.
<p>
Most pk's use pumice, I myself do not pk but I know there dirty tricks and here are some more dirty tricks.
<p>
1.  Water Polo.  When someone zaps you and runs in the water zapping them back is useless.  This is a cowardly way to fight but when they do this sick your pet on em and flush em out.
<p>
2.  Zone camping.  When you run to the zone and someone is waiting on the other side.  They zap you and you zone back.  Then when you reach the other side you are zapped again.  What to do you say?  When you zone turn off your computer then you will not pop out the other side.  When u relog in you will pop in and live to tell, hopefully they will of left.
<p>
Offensive trading and the harm that it causes.
If youve ever been grouped jumped you need to make your trade group only.  (for instance)  You are walking along and You are enthralled.  Then you are blinded and someone puts a trade window up on your screen.  when blind wears off you see the trade window and you press cancel that person throws the trade window up again and you are blinded again.  The whole time you are being blasted and beat on and you cannot bag your stuff. Then you are blinded again and a trade window is thrown up.  You press cancel and then you are killed.  (Moral to this story) Keep trade group only.  If you petition the Gm or Guide will not do anything about it.  They will say make trade group only or no trade at all.  This is the right answer it is your fault your trade was not group only.  To change your trade toggle, goto the options menu on the left side of your screen.
<p>
<More offensive trading><p>
As it stand right now there is a trade window bug.  If someone shows you a bag and you open it and they click cancel you will go LD, and be logged out of the game.  To fix this only trade with friends and dont open bags.  Tell them to take it out of the bag and put it in the normal window.  Until this bug is fixed dont trade w/people you dont know.
<p>
Finally thanks for hearing me out, I'm sure you'll find this info very important, for dueling and not getting killed in a pvp environment.  If you use this glitch to pk someone you will more than likely be banned.  So if you think you so smart to do it, your the stupid one.  Also once youve used up the pumice dont destroy it.  A pumice with 5 charges left on it or a pumice with 0 charges sells back to the merchant for 3plat 5 gold.
 <p> 
Btw Most pks dont want you to know this so haha to them.  That's probably the most important pvp information you need.  I dont like pk's but I love being on a pvp server, sure beats carebear.  Sorry about such a long post, but it has important info.
<p>
Magicians rock in pvp!!!  One of the best pvp classes!!!<p>

It doesnt really matter what pet you use when you pk, all are good, all do jack for dmg, and intterupt.  Ex: Lvl 49 magician summon Earth pet summoned w/focus object hits for 30 in pvp.  Hits for 60 non pvp.  Verant cut pet dmg in half in pvp.  Keep your bandage skill maxed it is a great skill, especially when the poison dot is eating you away at 1 bubble of hp and there is no-one around but you and the necros corpse.  Always buff your pet w/burnout I/II/III when fighting makes your pet hit harder.
<p>
