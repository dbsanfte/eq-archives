I'm not going to get into actually choosing stats for your new paladin...that is discussed in numerous places throughout the various websites devoted to EverQuest, or paladins in general.  What I'd like to discuss is some of the knowledge I've accumulated through my 46 levels as a half elf paladin on the Tunare server.  These things include spells, fighting, weapon selection, grouping, etc.  I hope this can be of help to aspiring paladins in Norrath.  I'll try to keep this targeted mostly for the first 30 levels or so, as at 46 I don't feel I can prescribe effectively the last 20 levels of your EQ life!

First off, some links that will prove helpful:

<B>General Information</B>
<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
There are some very important things to keep in mind when playing your paladin (mostly for new paladins):
<OL>
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Verant defines the paladin as 75% warrior, 25% cleric, and this is more or less an accurate idea of what a paladin is, and how they should be played.  For the most part, a paladin is a fighter/tank--we are on the front lines of a fight, taking damage and dealing it out, but we have spells to augment our fighting capabilities.  One thing to keep in mind is that dealing damage becomes less and less important as spell casters become more and more powerful.  It will come to a point in your career where you are in a battle to mostly ensure that the creature you're beating on doesn't get to the finger-wagglers!  Keep your <I>taunt</I> skill maxed at all times.  This is the true purpose of the tanking classes--taunt the beasts away from the real damage doers.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Keep multiple weapon skills maxed out.  Everyone starts out with their little <I>1hs</I> weapon, but don't forget <I>2hs</I>, and <I>1hb</I>!  We've recently been given the ability to use some very nice piercing weapons, so if you can manage to get your hands on a piercer it might be a good idea to keep this high as well.  When I started playing, a friend of mine gave me a Bone Bladed Claymore, a really nice weapon for a complete newbie, and I scorned all of my other skills--big mistake.  You're going to want to use ghoulbane when you can get one, and there are lots of very nice 1hb weapons in game as well (including a very nice one from the Plane of Hate).  Working these skills up later in life can be very painful.  I have yet to see a paladin that uses <I>2hb</I> much, so I don't include it, but by all means, keep this one maxed out as well if you so desire!
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Don't forget to <I>bash</I>!  This is another skill that you must keep maxed out.  It's a great skill to have against casters, as a well timed bash will keep them from casting, and will cause some damage as well.  Also, equipping a shield keeps the damage you're taking to a minimum--a nice bonus as well.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Of course, don't forget about <I>Lay on Hands (LOH)</I>.  This is the paladin defining skill, and is a real life saver.  In your young life it will save you many a times.  In your mid and later life you will find yourself using it to heal others more than yourself.  Remember, your cleric or enchanter dying will very likely lead to the death of your entire party.  Heal them first, and worry about a res later if you end up dying.  It's better to keep them alive for the well-being of the entire group (this helps you make LOTS of friends as well).
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify"><I>Sense Heading</I> is also an imperative skill.  While not paladin only by any means, lots of people forget to use it from the beginning.  It becomes very useful when you're exploring a zone you're not familiar with, and is easy to keep maxed out.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Use your spells to your advantage.  We are not only a wade-in-and-slash type of class, there is more to it than that.  Certain situations call for certain spells.  If your cleric is out of mana, you might have to heal your party.  Don't forget to use stun when fighting, keep the yaulp line handy to give yourself an extra boost, and use root to seperate a bad pull (also works great when soloing--root and heal).  When fighting undead, a paladin's spells are best--nuke those skeles back to hell.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Be chivilrous.  I realize that this is more of an roleplay type of issue, but when someone shouts for help, go help them!  It is the role of the paladin to help others in their need, even if it leads to pain for the paladin as well.  Don't stand and watch as someone gets beaten by multiple mobs because you're afraid to do anything about it.
</OL>
These are some of the most important aspects of the paladin class.  If you keep these things in mind when you're playing, you will make the most out of your character.

<B>Your First 8 Seasons in Norrath</B>
<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
Many sites and guides have commented on the dilemna of the new paladin, and they are all correct.  A paladin has a difficult life during the first 8 seasons of their careers.  Keep in mind, though, that these are also the fastest levels in the game, and you will be through them very quickly.  The biggest problem is that you will not receive the skills of warriors, so you will not be killing things as efficiently, and you won't have any of your spells yet, so you don't even have that added bonus!  It is definitely a tough part of your life, but one that can be overcome without too much heartache.
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
Set up your hot buttons effectively.  I like to put <I>Sense Heading</I> in the top left slot, <I>Taunt</I> in the one to the right of it, <I>Bash</I> (remember, bash can only be used if you're using a shield) in the one below it, and <I>Disarm</I> in the spot below taunt (you won't get disarm for quite a while, and bash isn't available to you at first, but it's for reference in the future).  Because we now have 10 hot buttons per pannel, I put <I>LoH</I> in the bottom right button spot.  That way, it's far out of reach from the others that you'll be mashing during a battle--so you won't use it accidentally.  Initially, keep hitting your sense heading button all the time, and keep it maxed out.  During battles, keep hitting all four of the top hot buttons during the fight.  This basically just saves time.  Instead of having to move around to find your fighting skill buttons, they're all in the same spot and are easily accessable.  The other buttons can be used for various other things.  I have one set up for a group incoming message for when I'm pulling, one that casts my heal spell, one for assisting (an important thing as you get higher in level), and one for sitting (to meditate, when you initially get the meditate skill make a button that does /book).
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
First of all, get out of the first five or so levels as quickly as possible.  There's no need to group at these levels, as soloing even, blue, and some yellow cons should be pretty easy at this point.  There's no need to make your life difficult.  Kill lots of stuff, and do it as fast as you can without dying.  Keep your weapon skills up as well--it may be hard to find enough weapons at this level to keep your skills up, but if you can get your hands on a rusty 2 handed sword or mace, keep them around.  You can replace them later on, but it's not a bad weapon to practice with when the mobs are still quite easy.  If you're worried about your cash flow, kill decaying skeletons (and skeletons when you get big enough) and bats, and save their bone chips and wings.  You can sell these to other players and usually make a good bit of plat for them, depending on the demand.
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
Concentrate on making friends early as well.  If you find a few key people that you like to group with a lot, you'll find that you'll advance more quickly, and you'll have a far better time doing it than if you were going solo.  Paladins are meant to be a grouping class, and although we can solo pretty effectively for a large portion of our career, you'll most likely find that you'll be far more efficient in a group.  The social aspects of this game are the most appealing part of it.  You will meet new people, and enjoy their company.  In many cases the people you meet at these levels will remain your friends into your later years.
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
As new skills become available to you, put one or two training points in them.  During these first 8 levels, you'll get <I>Bash</I> and <I>Dodge</I>, two very important skills.  For the most part, I like to train skills on the battlefield--not with the guild master.  It's more enjoyable, and you're gaining experience and plat while you train.  These first levels are going to make you feel like you're just another hack-n-slash (and you are at this point), but don't worry--your first round of spells will be a great addition, and come soon!
</FONT></P>

<B>Strong but Young, Your 9th Through 20th Years</B>
<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
Finally!  Spells!  Your level 9 spells may not be the most powerful things in Norrath, but they help a lot.  Use them to their fullest.  By now you have probably gotten somewhat of a good feeling for the capabilities of your character, and are ready to move on to bigger and badder things than snakes and rodents, etc.  If you're in the Freeport area, go to East Commonlands or South Ro.  If you're in Qeynos, head to Qeynos Hills and Blackburrow (killing gnolls is great fun).  If you're in Kaladim, Kelethin or Felwithe, head to Crushbone or to Freeport to hunt in the surrounding Freeport zones (be sure to get a bind).  If you're in Erudin...well, you've probably already left--hunt in the Qeynos area.  
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
Grouping is becoming more important now.  You can solo effectively, but grouping is usually a better option.  You'll be doing some good damage with your weapon, and you can also cast group buffs, so you'll be well received in groups.  There will come a point when your group will ask you to pull.  This is probably one of the more difficult things to master in EverQuest--and it's all brains.  Because you are defined as a tank, it may very well be your responsibility to pull different creatures back to your group to slaughter them, and multiple, messy pulls can be the quickest means to an ugly corpse recovery (did I tell you to be sure to bind at the closest city yet?).  Pulling is something others may be better at, but you will make a good stand in.  Here's a quick list of tips.
<OL>
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Ask if someone in your group can cast the spell harmony or something similar.  If so, they can help you by making monsters far less likely to attack.  If 3 out of 4 monsters have harmony on them, you can run up to the one, whack it, and run back to your group with it in tow, and the other three couldn't care less.  If noone can cast this, your job will be more difficult.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Make sure you con all of the creatures that you have any possibility of pulling!  Your group may very well be able to handle four blue conning monsters, but if one or two are yellow, you can be dead faster than you can say, "incoming!"
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Go for the single pulls first.  If there are three that look like they will be pulled together, and one straggler, get the straggler first.  If you pull the group of three you might end up getting the fourth anyway if one deviates from his path to get his buddy.  It's much easier to ensure that one will follow you and not pick up a few more than to ensure that with a multiple pull.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Assist after the pull.  If you're the main puller, be sure that everyone has you targeted, and when you get back to the group, they should all type /assist (making a hot button makes this lots easier).  They will automatically target and autoattack the same monster you are currently attacking (make sure you're in attack mode or else it won't work).  If you're not pulling, be sure to assist the main puller.  This isn't as important at lower levels, but once you get up into more difficult places, this can mean the difference between life and death.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Don't be arrogant.  Don't get your party killed because you decided it would be ok to pull 4 monsters.  If there are too many, just back off and analyze your options.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Run to the zone (and away from your group) if there are too many.  You might not make it, but it is far better to die by yourself than killing your entire party.  They may object to this, but it can be of vital importance as you get higher in level.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Be courteous, and make sure that you're not pulling something that is already taken.  Sometimes you may inadvertantly pull a mob that someone else is already fighting.  If you do, appologize and move on to something else.  There are more than enough creatures around for everyone in most cases.
</OL>
Grouping is a fun and challenging aspect of the game.  If you find you're in a group that isn't working out well, bow out graciously and find another.  Groups can be the fastest way to advancement, but are also the fastest way to death.
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
Keep working on those skills!  By level 20 you'll have received <I>Parry</I> and <I>Double Attack</I>.  These decrease the damage you're taking, and increase the damage you're delivering (respectively).  Having these new skills is a vital asset to you.  Don't forget your different weapons as well.  By this point you should be able to afford at least some reasonably good weapons for 1hs, 1hb, and 2hs, as well as a nice shield (Shiney Brass Shield is a good one for beginners).
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
Don't forget to keep your spells up to date.  At lvls 9 and 15 you get new spells.  Be sure to purchase them as soon as you can.  Some are more important than others, but many are important at some point.  Here are my favorites out of these (listed in order of usefulness):
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
At level 9:
<OL>
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Minor Heal--a healing spell!  This one is very important to you, and can save you in a fight.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Flash of Light--use it, and use it often on any creature that you're fighting.  It's also a good way to get away from a creature if you're getting low on health.  You will use this spell for many levels, in fact, at 46 I still use it from time to time.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Courage--a very nice buff for you and your party members, be sure to cast in your groups when you're buffing.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Yaulp--this is very helpful during a fight, as it increases your strenght and armor class, making you do more damage and take less damage.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Spook the dead--if you're fighting undead, and you get too many of them or just want to make them run away, cast this on them.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Cure Poison--can be useful in some situations.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">True North--not even worth it to buy it if you're keeping your sense heading skill maxed out.
</OL>
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
At level 15:
<OL>
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Light Healing--this one is an upgrade to your minor healing spell.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Ward Undead--one of your undead direct damage nuke spells, absolutely awesome for fighting undead, you'll use it a lot.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Holy Armor--another buff, this one increases your armor class.  This is a very important spell.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Cure Disease--if you're going to be fighting lots of undead monsters, this one can be very important.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Sense the Dead--this is nice if you're hunting and looking for undead monsters specifically--it will point you in the direction of the closest undead creature.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Lull--this is like the harmony spell I spoke of earlier.  I never used it much, but some people swear by it.
	<LI STYLE="text-align:justify">Hammer of Wrath--the first in your hammer line of spells.  This spell summons a magical hammer that you can use to work on your 1hb skills.  You'll fizzle a lot with it, and the weapon isn't that good.  I'd suggest buying a better one and not worrying about using this spell.
</OL>
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
Hunting places are easy to come by at these levels.  Blackburrow is still an option, but you might be bored of it by now.  Oasis is a good choice, but can be quite crowded, and West Commonlands is generally good as well.  All of these places are pretty well populated, so finding a group shouldn't be too difficult.  As you advance closer to 20, you can also try your hand in Unrest (on the continent of Faydwer) and Befallen (off of West Commonlands).
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
Concentrate on mixing your weapon attacks with your spells.  For instance, if you're fighting an undead monster, wait until after you swing, then cast ward undead.  It'll allow you to make the most damage, and make you a better fighter.  Also, be sure to buff yourself and party members.  This can mean the difference between life and death.  Make sure to heal your party up using you healing spells after battles.  This will decrease the amount of time you're just sitting around and increase your group effectiveness.
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
All in all, a paladin becomes quite a force to be reckoned with during these levels.  You'll probably find yourself enjoying your paladin quite a bit as you see the strength that fighting with spells and weapons will bring.
</FONT></P>

<B>A Proven Asset: Knighthood after 20</B>
<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
So, you've picked a surname, and you've proven to the world that you're not a newbie any more.  By now you're an effective fighter, you're a good caster, and you're loved by many for your resourcefulness.  In all honesty, it has only just begun!  The 20's bring new spells and combat abilities, and greater strengths to bring the evils of Norrath to its knees.  You'll get upgrades to many of the spells that you've been using for many seasons, and even some new ones that you'll be unfamiliar with.
</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
At this point you know how to play your character, and you've undoubtalbly made many friends, so I won't try to lecture on what to do after level 20.  I'm going to try to give insight on good places to hunt, and what to look for in some cases.  A paladin's strength always lies in the fight against undead, so if you can find a place that can give you experience and has lots of undead, fight there!  You'll find that you're far more effective, and will be loved in groups.  If you've saved enough money, find a ghoulbane and upgrade your other weapons and armor.  Ghoulbane is one of the best 1hs weapons in the game, and is paly only--it will serve you well for numerous levels to come.  You might want to look for Fine Steel Armor as well, and a Cracked Darkwood Shield.  Also, silver and platinum ruby veils are perfect for paladins.  Choose good jewelry--mostly items that will increase strength and wisdom, as they are our most important stats.  The following lists show different places for paladins of various levels to hunt.  Finding the right place may be a matter of taste, but I've found that the best places are generally well populated and will have some good people to group with.

<B>Conclusion</B>
<P STYLE="text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">
The life of a paladin is a difficult one.  The experience penalty we once had to shoulder has now been removed, but it is still one of the most challenging classes that one can play.  At the same time, though, it can be very rewarding.  Be strong, friendly, and helpful, and you will be respected and wanted.  A well played paladin can be one of the most important members of a group.  I hope you have found this guide helpful!  If you are on the Tunare server, feel free to look me up and ask questions.
