            <font color="#FFFFCC">Our Website has gone through another slight redesign. Now there is a
link marked &quot;INFO&quot; right below the &quot;NEWS&quot; link on our Navigation Bar to
the left. This new area has combined several of our other sections
including our &quot;LINKS&quot; section. You will also find information on the
structure of our guild as well as links to Registration Guides for our
Forum and for Guild Magic. Whether you are a new or old member there
should be something for you on this page. Please send any ideas,
submissions or corrections to kamdar@exodusfellowship.com. Also send
any News items you want to appear on this page to the same address and
mark it with the subject: NEWS.</font>

            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Last night in the cave where our Fellowship began, several members were
promoted after I stepped down from my leadership role. <br>
Arri became the new Leader of the High Council. Herbdiva was promoted
to the High Council and Macolic has joined the ranks of the Exodus
Honor Guard! Please raise your steins and wish them all well as they
continue to serve the guild and lead us into an exciting future!</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">3/12/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Check out the New Forum!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">You may have noticed that we are now trying out a new message board.
Many guilds use this kind of forum and there are a lot of good reasons
why. Information on certain topics should be easier to find since the
board is separated into various categories. Raids and events can be
discussed and planned in it's own section and then we can add them to
the calendar when things arefinalized. The Classifieds Section can
replace the WANT ADS link on this page, and you will no longer have to
send Ursi emails to add to that page. Other sections can be added as
needed. Once you have read all the posts you can click on &quot;Mark all
forums read&quot; Then you will be alerted with a little symbol on the side
when there are new posts. You do not have to register to use the forum,
but registration comes with added benefits. Registered members can add
a custom signature at the bottom of their posts. They can add banners
or pictures of their characters. You can also adjust how you view the
board. For instance you can adjust it so that threads with the most
recent posts jump to the top. You will have to be registered if you
want to participate in password protected forums such as officer
sections. Also if we institute the poll feature, members will have to
be registered to participate. Registration is fairly painless. If you
do register, it should be your character's name, or as close as you can
get to it. Some names may be taken. Choose any password you like, but
something you can remember. After you sign up and login, you will not
have to log in each time you want to post, you will stay logged in
unless you press the logout button. Please give this forum a shot.
After a few weeks we will see if you want to keep it.</font>

		<font color="#FFFFCC">Hail Exodus!<br>
		<br>
		I thought that headline might get your attention!<br>
		<br>
While it has been my greatest pleasure to serve as your leader these
past eight months the time has come for me to step down from my
position, and as a member of the High Council. This decision was not
easy for me. Many factors have come into play, but the main reason is,
I am unable to spend a good amount of quality time in Norrath with you.
While I have been working hard behind the scenes, I think it is
important that your leader be available in the world of Norrath much
more than I am able to be. Many of you, I have not even met, but
through your participation on the Forum and from hearing tales of your
adventures I feel like I have gotten to know you. I don't think there
is a better bunch of players in all of Norrath and I have been proud to
serve you.<br>
		<br>
My last day as your Leader will be March 13th. On that Wednesday we
will have a small ceremony in the tunnel at East Commons at 9pm EST to
announce and toast our new leader. While this person will be the Head
of the High Council, I want to remind all of you that everyone in the
High Council is considered a leader in their own right, and has always
served this Fellowship well, and will continue to do so. I can't tell
you the amount of emails from me that they have all been putting up
with! They have always acted professionally and with the best interests
of the Exodus Fellowship. They have become my friends, and I will miss
my day to day contact with them greatly. Although I have a feeling I
will be seeing many of you &quot;in game&quot; as often as I possibly can.<br>
		<br>
I am not leaving this guild and will still check the Forum everyday. I
will also continue to update the website as much as possible, but I
will need help from you folks. First, you are responsible for updating
your own characters through Guild Magic. This website is a great
resource and has been integrated into our new site design. Secondly, I
would hope that you are able to send me NEWS items that I can post in
the NEWS section. These should be announcements of upcoming raids and
events that tend to get lost in the shuffle when just posting them in
the Forum. Just make sure to give as much advance notice as you can so
I can post it and that everyone that needs to, gets the message!
Everyone should probably get used to checking the NEWS section
everyday. Hopefully we will get more activity on it!<br>
		<br>
As I have already said, I am not abandoning this guild. I will be a
proud member until it's final days, which I am sure is a long way off!<br>
		Our guild is strong and will continue to grow, to push on…to go forth.<br>
		Please give your leaders the trust, respect and friendship you have given me.<br>
		And continue the journey with us, as I believe our best days lie ahead.<br>
		<br>
		Yours in service,<br>

            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">3/04/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">March Awards!
            </font></b></p>
		<font color="#FFFFCC">Congratulations to our latest award winners! <br>
		<br> Arri
Ghent is the latest recipient of the Medal of Leadership. In or out of
the High Council, Arri has always been in the thick of things. whether
it's planning one of her many Wacky Wednesday events or being the voice
of reason when when things get a little tense, Arri has always shown us
that she is a natural born leader!<br>
		<br>
Our Medallion of Excellence goes to Chonn Kelvar and Agradeleous
Stormhelm, both of whom are terrific role-players. Chonn for his
endless tales of Barbarian hardship and Aggy for his sharp tongue, and
questionable Dwarf wit, have added a great deal of fun to this
Fellowship.<br>
		<br>
The Heart of Sacrifice goes to Macolic. This insane Monk is constantly
risking himself and dying for the safety of the rest of his group. He
has been known to disband and take the brunt of a creatures attack so
that the rest of his party can escape.<br>
		<br>
Nudle receives our Good Conduct Medal. His participation IN-GAME and
out is second to none! He's participated in just about everything since
joining the Guild and is constantly going out of his way to assist
fellow Guildees.<br>
		<br>
		The Medal of Contribution goes to Arri, Mantrena and Arathain for their generous contributions to the cost of this website!<br>
		<br>
And The Medal of Honor is awarded to Tanluin Atrackin. Tan has done a
great job at maintaining morale and guild member relations. The extra
work he took on during the voting for the Exodus Honor Guard process
was sensational. While not always in total agreement with the rest of
the Council, Tan always speaks his mind and his conscience!<br>
		<br>
Congrtatulation to all the recipients and remember, if you would like
to nominate someone, just contact a High Council member via email or
send him or her a tell while in Norrath!</font>
