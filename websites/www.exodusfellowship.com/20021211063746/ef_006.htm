		Be kind to others, not only to your brethren but also to non-members of the guild. Treat them as you would wish to be treated. To treat others poorly would put a bad light on the guild. The reputation of the guild is built and established by the daily actions of each and every member of the guild. Only actions positive to this reputation will be tolerated. For example, behavior such as kill stealing, foul (and/or offensive) language are not tolerated.   All unguilded alternates are also subject to this code of conduct.  The guilded member will be held accountable to the alts activities if it infringes on the rights of other guild members or the reputation of the Fellowship.
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F01 STYLE="left:83;top:421;width:405;height:111;">
		On occasion things can get confusing in the heat of the battle.<BR>
		If this happens and you accidentally steal a kill or attack a spawn not realizing someone else was already camping or otherwise engaging that target, please apologize to the other party (individual) and offer the loot from the kill to make amends.  In most cases this will resolve the dispute.
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F01 STYLE="left:83;top:581;width:398;height:75;">
		Intentional training is when one intentionally brings a mob or several mobs to an area with the intention of letting those mobs wipe out the players occupying the space.  This is a very EVIL practice and will not be tolerated under any circumstances
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F01 STYLE="left:83;top:845;width:410;height:57;">
		Please do not play in anonymous mode. Play in the roleplaying mode if you wish your class or level to remain anonymous. If your guild tag does not show then there is no point in having one. 
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F01 STYLE="left:83;top:959;width:391;height:75;">
		Roleplaying is highly encouraged! Get into your character. <BR>
		This makes life in Norrath much more fun for everyone. <BR>
		Write a biography about your character to post on this site!
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F01 STYLE="left:83;top:702;width:435;height:93;">
		Please no begging for powerleveling, money, items etc. It would put us in a bad light to beg non guild members. And it would annoy guild members to be begged for things. Keep in mind we will try and help when we can but we all have our own worries.  When possible, please try to offer goods and services to your fellow guildmates at reduced prices.
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F01 STYLE="left:83;top:1237;width:439;height:39;">
		Always try and have a good time, we are together as friends and fun should be a priority. 
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F01 STYLE="left:10;top:1316;width:570;height:147;">

		The guild and its leadership take accusations of inappropriate behavior (some of which is defined above) very seriously.  If a member is accused of wrong doing it will be investigated by the leadership who will then decide how to handle the situation once all the facts are known.<BR>
		In the event of an accusation we ask the guild not to discuss it in guild or open chat until all the facts are known, and the leadership has had a chance to deal with the situation.  If the action is determined to be severe enough, it is possible the member will be dismissed from the guild.

If you are unable to take a few minutes to say hello to your new family, then this might not the place for you.  It is also strongly suggested that all members visit this website's NEWS section and FORUM on a regular basis.  This will keep you informed as to what is going on.
