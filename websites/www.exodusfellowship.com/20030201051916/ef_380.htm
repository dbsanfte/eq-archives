		I call myself Thallus<BR>
		I suppose all things call themselves something so this is just what I call myself,  Well you must forgive me my traipsing in the woods has caused my mind to wander ever so freely.<BR>
		<BR>
		I have been living in Norrath for many a year now, and recently my grandson Mathemeo brought me out of despair so that I might fight again.   But my story begins long before that ..<BR>
		<BR>
		I grew up in the way of sword and nature as was taught to me by my lineage,  I was raised in the secluded woods of jagged pine and surefall glade.   It was the dis-harmony caused by the gnolls that fired my heart against the evils of this world.  to see loved ones cloven down for mere enjoyment was more than any youth should see.    I slew many a gnoll that summer but realized that my vengeful heart could not be satisfied to stay close to home. I had to leave,    and thus my wandering days began.<BR>
		<BR>
		I saw many a wonder in my youthful years and I must admit there are still many things that still make this old eyes feel young.      I have fought beside many braves souls on my adventures some have lived and some have perished "may the mother bless them" and it's to the living I have pledged myself.   There is this small group of people I have discovered that I have devoted a special loyalty, . they call themselves the Exodus,  no matter where I am in this world I am sure to run into one of them and will always offer my friendly advice.     For those of you who have chosen other paths be it they way of magic or of steel.  I suggest that next time you our out in the wilderness of this world,  stop, listen,  close your eyes, and feel the peace that resides.    This is what I fight to protect,  my our swords clash only those who would defile life.<BR>
		In words of a ranger,<BR>
		<BR>
		May your feet take you where they will<BR>
		And may your arrows be true,<BR>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		Thallus Carnivora,<BR>
		Of the Exodus Fellowship

		I Mathemeo, I Greet you all and ask that when you deam me worthy that I may join your fellowship.  This is my story!<BR>
		<BR>
		Sunday Ocktobre of the cycle 03,  I Mathemeo took up arms against the forcees of Darkness. I chose the way of the woods as my grandfather Thallus of Surefall Glade.  Not much is known of his disapperance some say he still walks these worlds with more than a sturdy wooden stave, forever leaving his raincaller to the ages.<BR>
		<BR>
		Wendesday,  same month, same year.  I aquainted myself with Jyle Windshot of Surefall Glade and he gave me instruction of sword and bow….<BR>
		"the gnolls will perish"<BR>
		·	note:  "earned my first scalp today, my wounds are of honor"<BR>
		<BR>
		A later hour, A half elf with a lighting blade greeted me with warmth,  Arathain was as he is known.  He told me of great deeds done with my grandfather.   With a gift of armor he traveld with me to the city in the trees.  "Exquisite," I say.<BR>
		But my heart is troubled by the war drums of orcs I hear in the distance.<BR>
		<BR>
		Ocktobre, Friday,  03, I have learned much from my short stay in Fayder,  Friends unknown sough me out and gave me blessings for deeds of my lineage.  A man or bear I know not which,  Ash'man is his family line,  he looked over my should while I greew to season 10 and granted  me with a sword….<BR>
		<BR>
		"I swear on my grandfathers' sword flamesong I will not falter until these lands are cleansed of darkness's touch"<BR>
		<BR>
		I have found him,  I have found my grandfather,  past eastern planes and over molten fires of lava, in a temple called Ro.   His face was ghostly but softened when I told him who I was.  We sipped our wine satchels and talked idly in low whispers.  We talked of pleasantries but the turned to talk of darker things<BR>
		<BR>
		"Mathemeo, I have left things undone,  I was sent on a quest. I cannot sulk at my failures, I must finish"<BR>
		<BR>
		Up until now my grandfather had huddles in this corner, shrouded in shadow.     He jumped up with such agility that I fell back on my duffer.   His face stern and scared but the eyes were intense and alive.  There was still humanity left in them….Contrasting his graying hair.<BR>
		<BR>
		"Grandson, I must retrieve my bow and strengthe my arms, there are battles to be fought.<BR>
		I must travel to the city of mist and slay a reaver,  then to a castle called Karnor's, to bring back to life an iksar only to slay him…     Two other places I must go…   a place in the clouds, and then last of all, I must kill the demi god, Innoruk.<BR>
		Mathemeo, thankyou, I will return with you to the wild,  May Tunare watch over us"<BR>
		<BR>
		Cheers!<BR>
		Mathemeo of Surefall Glade<BR>
