            <p style="text-align:justify;"><font color="#FFFFCC">Well, the fight did not go exactly as I planned. While I was busy
talking smack on the forum it seems that sneaky Kamdar was researching
exactly how to kill wizards. When the fight started, he tried to snare
or root me and I resisted. So I tried to root him and was resisted. He
came at me so I teleported out of range and decided to hammer him with
a nuke. BAM, I got him good! Feeling confident I tried to de-buff him.
After I finished casting I noticed my buffs were gone! I thought at
first that I targeted myself but to my surprise Kamdar was de-buffing
me! Needless to say things went down hill from there. He began nuking
and chasing me around while my own nukes were barely damaging him. Soon
I was out of manna, hit points, and sitting naked at the entrance
completely dumbfounded. Congrats Kamdar! You are still the best!</font></p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;"><font color="#FFFFCC">This is what I have to do to get the Wizard to contribute to the NEWS
section! At first when Cobo challenged me, I thought I would go down
without much of a fight. Truthfully, I couldn't even figure out why he
would want to since it would be so easy. After some research and asking
around, I started to think that I could actually beat him, if I could
keep the element of surprise. I felt I was going in with enough
resistance and debuffing gear to really give it a shot. That feeling
did not last long when I stepped inside the arena. I could not tell if
my Pumice Stones were debuffing him and most of the time I could not
even find him as he kept popping up all over the Arena. Those first few
shots that got thru my resists really did some damage and when I was
comparing his health bar to mine I thought it would be over soon. And
then his Mana ran out. I won by the skin of my teeth. Good show Cobo!</font>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">8/17/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Please send in your Award Nominations!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Several awards will be distributed on or around September 1st. We have
received several nominations regarding several of you whose behavior or
achievements is above and beyond your fellow guildmates. However, the
majority of the nominations have come from officers. Remember, these
awards were created to recognize some of our finer members, not just
those whose actions are noble in the presence of officers<br>
So, get your nominations in! Anyone can nominate an Exodus member,
whether they are in the guild or not! Remember, there are only 2 weeks
left! And if you haven't done so already, read the award descriptions!</font>
		<p><font color="#FFFFCC">Please make sure you send your nominations to the E-mail address and keep them off of the Forum.  <br>
		We like our recipients to be surprised when they have no idea a commendation may be coming!</font>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">8/15/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">The minimum level requirement has been raised!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">The Fellowship is growing rapidly, and why wouldn't we if we are the
best guild on Povar? More and more people are realizing that they are
missing out, and are joining the ranks. The main reason we are such a
wonderful guild is the family atmosphere, the close-knit, friendly, and
warm feeling within our halls. The High Council worries that a rapid
influx of new people could damage the family type atmosphere that so
many of us cherish. However, we definately do encourage new recruits to
join us. So what's the answer?<br>
		<br>
As always, we strongly encourage our officers to be EXTREMELY selective
in their recruiting process. We don't want to appear elitist, but we
want to make sure the person will feel at home, and will be welcomed. <br>
		<br>
In addition, the High Council has decided that it is in the best
interest of the entire guild to raise the minimum level requirement for
new recruits to 25. The majority of our members (mains) are of this
level already, and therefore a new recruit would have no trouble
finding people to fight with. Raising the requirement will aid us in
keeping the number of recruits to a manageable level, and give us a
chance to meet and group with the new recruits, and enable them to get
the attention they deserve. <br>
		<br>
		This level requirement is for NEW RECRUITS ONLY, the level requirement for alts will stay at level 10.<br>
		<br>
		As always, please email your thoughts or concerns to me or any of the other High Council members.</font>

            </font></b><p><font color="#FFFFCC">Thought you'd be interested to know that we're adding in Luclin ports
and putting them on Test server this weekend. These spells will be
available to both druids and wizards as convenient vendor sold scrolls.
<br>
		<br>
We've added a Nexus port for druids, and ports to Dawnshroud, Twilight
Sea, and Grimling Forest for wizards and druids. This should help cut
the travel time to the remote areas of Luclin, and it's something that
a lot of players have been asking for.</font>

            </font></b></p>
		<b><font color="#FFFFCC">EQ Tech Director comments on lost items while looting corpses with the new User Interface
            </font></b><p><font color="#FFFFCC">Items occasionally poof in the new UI if you loot them from a corpse
too quickly. The problem is that the new UI doesn't follow some of the
same inventory handling rules as the old UI. For now, the best way to
get around it is to loot containers slower, as if you were using the
old UI. <br>
		<br>
Remember how the old UI would pause you between looting bags from your
corpse? Unfortunately, for now, you'll have to do something similar on
your own. Please pause for a few seconds (longer if you are badly
lagged) between looting items, especially containers, and you shouldn't
be affected by this problem any longer.<br>
		<br>
In the meanwhile, if you do not wish to take this precaution, you may
always switch back to the old ui via the /NEWUI command, then logging
out and restarting EverQuest. We have a fix that will be working soon
on Test (if it isn't already) and will be rolled out to the live
servers in the next patch, courtesy of Messrs Wamtin and Rowyl.<br>
		<br>
		Thanks both for the patience, and all of the information. We'll get this fix live just as soon as it's stable.<br>

            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Three photo shoots have been scheduled for those members that need
pictures taken of themselves to be used with their info on Guild Magic
(assuming it comes back online!) or for paintings to accompany their
biographies on their own personal prolile pages. <br>
		<br>
The first photo session is to take place in The Great Divide on
Wednesday August 7th at 10pm Eastern. If you are in the area and need a
shot taken please send me a tell. Two more shoots are scheduled for
next week and more will follow, so keep your eye on the Calendar for
full details of where and when. <br>
		<br>
By the way, check out Tanluin's page for my latest attempt at a
painting type of picture. While I admit these do not approach the
artistry of Wyndforge's Art of Norrath, I think they are starting to
come along nicely... and they're a lot cheaper too! Remember, to get a
painting type of pic, you will have to send in a biography, as these
are a lot more work. Otherwise you will get the typical type of shot
that Ursi and I have been supplying since the beginning... and those
aren't too shabby either!</font>

on our special profile pages, I will attempt to provide a new character
painting to accompany your words. These are intended to be a &quot;cut
above&quot; the pix we use for Guild Magic, and will only be done when
members have submittted a written a biography to go with it.<br>
		<br>
If you are interested, please contact me to set up a photo session so I
may create a new painting from the photo. To view biographies, click on
&quot;Profiles&quot; at the left navigation bar. At this time only Kamdar (uh,
that's me!) has one of the new paintings. If you do not want to bother
with the photo session and the special page, you may always add your
biography to your character profile within Guild Magic.</font>
