		Unlike you warm bloods I never knew my folks. I was hatched with my brothers and sisters under a fallen down pillar outside of Cabilis. Where I found we allready possesed certain skill ie. one brother could raise the dead (necromancer), another was very in tune with his body (monk). I on the other hand had a knack for healing and buffing myself.<BR>
		<BR>
		I later found that I could cast forth numerous diseases and poisons upon my prey, which made them very angry. I was able to elude them by heightening my speed, strength, stamina, dexterity,agility, and charisma by calling on the spirits of animals. I had vowed to my deity to wipe the continent of Kunark (my continent) clean of all other races. My brothers and myself after doing much damage to the undead in the Field of Bone set out to the Lake of Ill Omen where we found many strange and vile creatures. Among them were human, elves, sarnac, goblins, barbarians, and so forth. We banded together sometimes, allowing our foes to join us, but all the time cursing them behind their backs. Once the goblins and sarnac are ridden from our continent we shall work on the others.
