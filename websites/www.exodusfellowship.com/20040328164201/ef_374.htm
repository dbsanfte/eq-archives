		Ok, it's not that bad, but this month several bills are due for the upkeep of the website.  The renewal of the exodusfellowship.com domain name is due toward the end of the month, the fee for that is 35.00 for one year.  In two weeks our Gold status for the Forum will end and we will be deluged with a never ending stream of Pop-up ads.  The cost for that is now 41.00 for another six months of ad free bliss.  Last time it was 30 bucks, but their prices are adjusted according to the number of hits our forum gets, and our forum gets alot of hits!  There is also the 10 dollar monthly charge from my website hosting company which also keeps ads off the main part of the site (everything but the forum) Adding this whole thing up, it now comes out to (if I did my math right) 237.00 a year to maintain this site.  That comes out to about 19.75 per month.  So needless to say I am open to taking donations!<BR>
		<BR>
		Any amount from 5.00 on up would be most appreciated.  If you have donated in the past, I thank you, and please consider yourself exempt from this little fundraiser.  If you have not donated in the past and wish to now, please know that your generosity is greatly appreciated and that I will continue in my quest to make this site one of the best Guild related sites out there! If you are interested in contributing, please send a check or money order to...<BR>

		Awards were given out last Thursday night in Lake Rathe Arena.  Please congratulate the following award recipients:<BR>
		<BR>
		Niarki recieved the Medal of Excellence for her outstanding ability to play the enchanter class.  Many of us have witnessed her quick thinking and mob-juggling abilities first hand.  She is an impressive player.<BR>
		<BR>
		Herbdiva recieved the Medal of Contribution for her efforts maintaining the guild vault.  This is not an easy task, and she handles it very well.  I think we all owe Herby a big thanks!<BR>
		<BR>
		Scoonie and Singsang were also awarded the Medal of Contribution for thier generous donations to the website.<BR>
		<BR>
		Ursi was awarded the Good Conduct Medal for consistent aid and rezzing for fellow guildmates, as well as her willingness to make items for people and support them on quests.<BR>
		<BR>
		Gilgamesch was awarded the Good Conduct Medal for his consistent great attitude and for his contribution of time and wisdom to this guild.  We are all very glad to have him back!<BR>
		<BR>
		Qural was also awarded the Good Conduct Medal for his support of quests, rezzing of guildmates, and overall good attitude.  Qural has been quite an asset to this guild as well.<BR>
		<BR>
		Chastisy has already recieved the Good Conduct Medal, but we wanted to reaffirm the award, as her behavior, cheerfulness, and assistance to this guild never falters.<BR>
		<BR>
		Likewise, Ashmael's Rescue Award was reaffirmed after his consistent efforts to recover the bodies of lost friends.  We all look at our gear and thank those like Ashmael for returning our belongings to us.<BR>
		<BR>
		Three new awards were added.  <BR>
		<BR>
		The first, the Benevolent Tradesman Award goes to Plaxibo for his overwhelming abilities when it comes to tradeskills, and his willingness to help out guildmates both with their skills, and with items that he has fashioned.<BR>
		<BR>
		The second, The Lemming Medal was recieved by Domonique and Chonn.  This medal is obtained by those who consistently put themselves in harms way, and proceed to get themselves killed often.  I think Domonique and Chonn are both very deserving of this medal.  All in good fun, guys!<BR>
		<BR>
		The last award we added was the Angel of Death Award.  This is obtained when a guildie does something that they shouldn't have, something they should have known better about, and gets their group killed.  No one has obtained this award yet, and I sure hope I'm not around when someone does finally earn it!  Again, all in good fun.<BR>
		<BR>
		Congratulations award-winners, keep up the great work, and everyone please keep those nominations coming in! <BR>

		<OL TYPE=1>
			<LI>  If you need a port, please don't single anyone out in tells, but in guild talk ask, "Is anyone porting?"  That is what I usually do and sometimes get a response. If not, I assume the porters have an agenda and it does NOT include me.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=2>
			<LI>  It is never polite to ask to be power-leveled. If you have a main and want your alt to be power-leveled, strike a bargain with someone. I'll power-Lvl. your alt if you power-lvl mine.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=3>
			<LI>  Also what goes around comes around. If you are willing to unselfishly power-lvl, help with a quest or assist another in any way it usually comes back to you but not always from the same source.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=4>
			<LI>  Please don't ask higher level who is desperately trying to lvl which is hard to do the higher you go and also busy doing hi lvl crafts (getting annoying needed little things that does not help with lvling) or on an epic quest to drop everything and come running to Timbuktu to assist a lvl 20 or something. They did not have the pleasure of such assistance and did it on their own. So can you.  Again, ask in GU talk if anyone is available and willing but please please don't single anyone out, harass, needle, nag, or beg. (Guild by-laws say NO BEGGING and could mean expulsion.)
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=5>
			<LI>   As for plat, we all need it for different reasons. Please Never ask for plat, but do ask for suggestions on how to raise it.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=6>
			<LI> If a guildie travels long distances to assist you, ask if you can reimburse them for it.  They might have had to pay for a transport and may need to be reimbursed.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=7>
			<LI> If a NON guildie, rezes, ports, assists, etc., offer a payment for their services.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=8>
			<LI> For Clerics, (Don't know what other classes because I don't have a tank.)  it cost them plat to cast symbol on you, so offer to pay for their buffs.  Might apply for other casters, I don't know??
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=9>
			<LI> Always share the loot.  Guildie or NON guildie. alike.  Ask if anyone is collecting anything before looting and destroying, like silk, quest item, etc.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=10>
			<LI> If someone in the guild needs something, don't feel like you have to leave what your doing to assist.  We all have our own agenda.  I find most times, someone is willing to help but is sorry if they cannot.  I also feel those who are the most willing to assist are the ones I am most willing to leave what I'm doing to help.  
		</OL>
		<BR>
		This is a game that mimics real life in many ways.  So play with others as you would like them to play with you.  And realize, there are many different personalities here.  So not everyone is the same.

		Often in the hectic and frantic days of leveling, killing and questing we can forget one of the most important things of social behavior...  Our Manners!  Several of your Officers came up with some very helpful guidelines to keep us living in harmony with our fellow Norrathians.  Not only should we treat our fellow guildmates with kindness and respect but all the citizens of Norrath and Luclin as well (Cept Trolls of course!).  Remember, we are all ambassadors of the Exodus Fellowship and our reputation and honor are of the utmost importance.  If you haven't brushed up on the Bylaws lately, now may be a good time.  Please know that we take infractions very seriously, and disregard of our Bylaws could lead to disbandment.  We have grown alot in the past several months.  Please let us not forget where we came from and as we journey ahead, to be kind to others along the way.

		A Few More Pearls of Wisdom...

	<DIV CLASS=F03 STYLE="left:423;top:307;width:270;height:339;color:#c0c0c0;">
		Port etiquette : If you need a port, and a guildie is willing to assist you, try to get to a druid rings/wiz spires to help them port you out faster if at all possible.<BR>
		<BR>
		Rez etiquette. Remember your cleric is possibly the most traveling challenged class in the game. Please have your corpse dragged safely to zone or in a safe area before the cleric comes to you. If the cleric needs a port please make accommodations for him or her if necessary.<BR>
		<BR>
		Tradeskills etiquette - we will spot materials for you if it is convenient for us to do so or give them to you if we want to up or skills or be altruistic but please` have all components ready if you expect someting on the spot. www.eqtraders.com has very thorough recipes. <BR>
		<BR>
		Reinvites - if you disband and want a reinvite - the high council will vote on your request. We are not obligated to reinvite you and each case is different and shall be evaluated individually.   So please remember to think before you act rashly and leave the guild as an act of defiance.  It is always better to talk things out first

		Let's talk Raids!

	<DIV CLASS=F03 STYLE="left:424;top:703;width:270;height:224;color:#c0c0c0;">
		Be early, or at least on-time for raids and other guild events. The time stated for guild events is the time we want to get started, not the time that you should think about asking for a port to get there. Please don't be surprised if we've started without you, and, if we have, if we're not all that excited about sending someone out to get you. In some cases, this is not a big deal, but some raids require us to fight our way in, and mobs pop behind us. Going back for someone often means we have to extract the entire raid party to keep things safe. Likewise, if we're making public announcements at a guild event, please don't expect people to repeat back the whole thing to you because you couldn't make it on time.
