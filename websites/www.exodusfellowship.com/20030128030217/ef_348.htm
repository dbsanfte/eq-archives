		It was a dark and wet night - so they tell me - the day I was born unto the woods of the Greater Faydark.

	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:29;top:545;width:588;height:543;">
		"Nonetheless, you still came into this world with a cry that sounded more like a little diddy than any real complaints about your arrival" a friend of my mother's once told me. <BR>
		<BR>
		My time with my mother - my father was never known to me - was short. I was but a child when the blasted Orcs of Crushbone drug her off to slavery and to eventual death. I was left to fend for myself, and that I did through friendly donations from those to whom I would sing a song or when I would spin a yarn at the Hearthwood Inn.<BR>
		<BR>
		The years went by, and when I was but barely into manhood Banker Willaen suggested that I go see Serilia Whistlewind to more properly learn the trade of song, dance, sword play, and story telling - the life of a bard. Armed with nothing but a note (so to speak), I was sure the bards of Kelethin would toss me out on my ear as a charleton, but I was pleasantly surprised to find myself welcomed warmly - it seemed that I had been seen and heard by many of those of the guild, and they thought I had potential. And so it was I began the formal education in my craft that continues yet today.<BR>
		<BR>
		I am happy to say that I have been able to take my revenge and wreak my wrath upon those of Crushbone - and even Emperor Crush himself. That revenge, however sweet it may have been, did little however to warm my heart like that day in the Northern Desert of Ro when I first met my beloved. Some call her a "Chanter" - Tunare knows she has enchanted me.<BR>
		<BR>
		If you see us around, be sure to hail us - we are always glad to share and ale, and I'm always happy to spin a tune.
