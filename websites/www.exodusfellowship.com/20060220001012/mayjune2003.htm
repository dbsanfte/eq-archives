		following news.  It is with a heavy heart that I tell<br>
		you that Circle of Shields is disbanding.  Many of<br>
		them have fought and died with us, and many of us have<br>
		joined them in their battles.  The guild has made it's<br>
		mark on Norrath, and it will be missed.<br>
		<br>
		As an ally, the High Council feels that we should do<br>
		everything in our power to assist them through this<br>
		troubling time.  If Exodus ever disbanded, my biggest<br>
		grief would be knowing that friends have split apart. <br>
		We wish to help Circle of Shields avoid this. <br>
		Therefore, it is with open arms that Exodus Fellowship<br>
		welcomes many of our allies into our own ranks.  <br>
		<br>
		As a celebration of the merger, we will be meeting in<br>
		the Lake Rathe Arena on Friday, 6pm EST.  At this<br>
		time, many of our allies will become our guildmates. <br>
		Please try to attend and join the celebration.<br>
		<br>
		The period following the merger may be difficult for<br>
		several of the new members.  I would ask that each of<br>
		you make a special effort to get to know everyone and<br>
		make them feel welcome.<br>

		Thank you, and ALL HAIL CIRCLE OF SHIELDS!</font>

For those of you that are relatively new to us, Arri has served on our

us knew him as Warmadz, a friendly Shaman Barbarian with a big heart.
Unfortunately, Warmadz's journey with us is over. His user Scott Cole
has passed away. Please join us in Halas, Sunday evening, June 1st as
we say goodbye to our dear friend. For more details make sure to keep
checking the &quot;Fellowship Lodgings&quot; section of our forum.</font>

duels, awards and promotions were handed out by Arathain. Little did
Sindee know that she would be a recipient of both!<br>
		<br>
Mantrena, Tanluin and Macolic have stepped down from the High Council
to live their lives as Sages of the Fellowship. Their fine service to
the guild will always be appreciated and we thank them greatly for it.
This opened the door for some new promotions. After serving us so well
for many months, Plaxibo and Gilgamesch have moved up to the High
Council. Also joining them was one of our founding members as well as a
former member of the HC, Wamphyre! Promoted to the Honor Guard were
Idylla and Sindee!</font>

            </p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">The first Guildees to win the Dragon Slayer Medallion are Thallus who
helped take down Trakanon, Malya who had a part in taking down Vox, and
Daliddar assisted in the slaying of Ragefire the night before the
party! There also was another recent slaying of Ragefire that many
EF'ers were involved in. Please congratulate Qural, Ursi, Sindee,
Berina, Ashmael, Karmyn, Skynight, Rivin, and Rathgard for also being
recipients of the coveted Dragon Slayer Medallion!<br>
		<br>
The Rescue Medallion is given to members who are successful in pulling
corpses out of extremely dangerous places. Chastisy has been awarded
the Rescue Medallion for her assistance in corpse runs on several
occasions.<br>
		<br>
The Benevolent Tradesman Medallion is awarded to those who put their
trade skills to good use for the guild. Thallus has earned this award
through fletching nightmare bows for the guild.<br>
		<br>
The Good Conduct Medal is given to members who continually show
selflessness and kindness to other members. These guildies are a
blessing to have among our ranks. New recipients of the Good Conduct
Medal are Sindee, Boffle, and Valathia.<br>
		<br>
A belated congratulations to every award recipient and promoted
Fellowshipper! And keep yer eye out... cuz next time will be handing
out some EPIC Medallions! Unless you've been living under a rock, you
know that Xzii and Ursi have completed their Epics... and I'm sure
there are more to come!</font>

            <font color="#FFFFCC">Xzii's raid was first. We had an amazing mass of participants from EF,
COS, and Rascals for the raid on the General in Kithkor. We even had a
much appreciated guest appearance from our friend Polyx... All kinds of
good loot dropped and Tawindy from CoS won the roll on a nice RMB for
her guild. Gratz CoS. We spawned and killed the General 3 times back to
back so a Rascals rogue and another rogue could also get epic piece
components! I know the rogue from the Rascals also has his epic after
this.<br>
		<br>
After this epic raid, we ran to SF. Thanks to EF, PB , CoS, and IL we
dropped that pesky Rage and his human form like a bowling ball on a
pillowcase. In one of the most entertaining displays of overkill of all
time, Ursi got her epic piece no problem! Gratz to Rathgard who picked
up a plasmatic priest robe from the human form - one less part of his
epic he'll have to do...</font>
