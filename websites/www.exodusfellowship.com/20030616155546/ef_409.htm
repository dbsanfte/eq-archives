		When I grew in confidence and skill I was released into the world to help take down the terrible orc problems that were beginning to distroy our lands. After fierce fighting and with several allies a group of us finaly took down the leader Emperer Crush himself. Feeling satisfied in finishing my personal quest and my skills now far better then before I was set out to see the world.  I traveled to many places, Freeport Everfrost ...ect,. slaying all manor of beasts reaching even heightened levels of skill.  I was pulled up to the moon where I discovered wonderous things and a race of cat like people I had never seen before . I was suprised to hear of the troubles they were having in Paludal Caverns with a group of bandits...  Upon arriving there I was fortunate to find a band of fellow adventurers who were also there to slay the foul bandits... some for there loot and some for the good of Shadow Haven. <BR>
		<BR>
		It was here that I joined my first guild Spirit of the Heart. We had many great adventures together, and made many places safe to live.  It was also here that I met the most unthinkable of friends I could ever have . A Iskar named Xatrekik . Although he was alot into working with dead things, he was very much a great battler and was for the most part a good person.  As I grew to know him I realized he is a friend and ally I could trust whenever I was in a pinch. after several years he decided to leave the guild Spirit of the Heart for reasons I'm not quite sure of, but later found out he wanted more slaying of evil .<BR>
		<BR>
		Hearing from him several years after he had left,He had found a new guild Exodus Fellowship and told me of the wonderous things they were doing for the world. So after much struggle I left my Family of Spirit of the Heart, in search of more good doings on a higher scale. Becoming a member of Exodus fellowship has been a great experience for me and I myself recruited another great friend named Tindianea. Much like a ranger, she had similar spells and goals in life. At the time she was a member of the guild Immortal Ones whom I found to be self centered and clickish and I knew this would be a great improvement on her part.<BR>
		<BR>
		Now with my new friends I am still slaying evildoers with much more force and have learned alot from the many other Rangers in the guild. I've seen and slain things I would have never dreamed I would be able to, been to many wonderous places, and plan to stay here for many years to come.<BR>

		LONG LIVE EXODUS FELLOWSHIP <BR>

		I was born and raised in a little hut in Kelethin. Spending my days with my father hunting and tracking for dinner, My father realized right off that some day I would like to become a ranger. With my fathers help at an early age I was inducted into the training of the Faydark Champions and was well on my way to  being a great ranger.
