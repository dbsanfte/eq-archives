		My mother, Herbdeva, was also a tailor and a cleric and taught me all that <BR>
		she knew.  She names me after her.  Deva means Nature Spirit or wood elf and <BR>
		Diva means Goddess or Blessed One.  <BR>
		<BR>
		She discovered one day that she would not live for very long (her life was <BR>
		limited by someone else's account).  So she saved her money and bedded with <BR>
		many of the wealthy travelers that come through RV hoping to have an <BR>
		offspring to share her wisdom with.<BR>
		<BR>
		Herbdiva was born of the Goddess Bristlebane, offspring to Herbdeva.  <BR>
		However, I do not know who my father is.  The Deva financed the Divas <BR>
		education and training by selling batwings to some of the rich wayward <BR>
		travelers that passed through.  Diva stayed in Misty Thicket where she honed <BR>
		her craft, tailoring, and practiced her calling, healing.<BR>
		<BR>
		Several of the wealthy travelers noticed my gift for healing, kind spirit and <BR>
		enjoyed my sense of humor and decided when they come for visits to take me <BR>
		under their wings to help nurture and mature me I am thankful especially to <BR>
		Part… and Nor… for their living support to this inexperienced newbee.  I am <BR>
		more worldly, skilled and aggressive than my mother of which my mom and my <BR>
		surrogate male figures are very proud.  I hope to have an offspring one-day, <BR>
		perhaps a druid.  <BR>
		<BR>
		I currently make money selling weight reduction bags, raw silk and cured silk <BR>
		armor.  Occasionally I return to Misty Thicket where my mom further finances <BR>
		my training.  My focus at the moment is to assist and heal my new guildmates <BR>
		in protecting the lands of Norrath from those many vile varmints

		I was born a Halfling in Rivervale, a quaint, happy  little city.  Shortly, when old enough to walk I moved to the countryside, Misty Thicket, where I learned to love the woods, hunted for bats and spiders and foraged for blueberries and learn a craft, tailoring, which I learned from my mother.
