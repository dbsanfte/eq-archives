		That is when I became a Shaman, a tall man asked if anyone cared to learn the ways of the spirit world, I decided to try it out and left my fellow hatchlings behind. At first I was ready to leave, after many attempts to cast a spell and having it backfire upon me, that is when I learned that us Iksar have a secret trait, an ability to regenerate. When I was ready to set foot out of the city, I learned to kill those pesky scaled wolves fast before a roaming pack of them came by to maul me to death.<BR>
		<BR>
		After several years of beating off these wolves, and also killing scorpians because they hurt when they sting, a short flesh appeared before me one day. He was a rogue, what a rogue was, I did not know at the time, but he continually disappeared and reappeared behind me. I wanted to taste his flesh, but he was bundled up tight in some armor I had never seen before, for our warriors wear silks just like our monks. He handed me some of this strange armor and told me to put it on, it was uncomfortable at first, but it did prevent the wolves and scorpians for injuring me, then he handed me a club to smack things with, I laughed at him, but he insisted. So i placed me mace that was given to me by the man who taught me the art of spellcraft on the ground, and grabbed the club, and promptly smacked the rogue across the face with it. He laughed at me and walked away, why he laughed I do not know, I was about to release the power of the Spirits upon him, but for some reason deep in my gut I couldn't, this feeling I do not know what is was. And yet, it was warm and fuzzy, I didn't like it, not one bit. Later I learned the name of this fellow, it was Verf, he was the brother of Khaba, until his parents turned their back on him for becoming a rogue.<BR>
		<BR>
		Why he came and gave me this stuff I do not know, but I learned a valuable lesson, anyone who treats an Iksar with kindness should receive it back from that Iksar, for kindness comes few and far apart to the Iksar. That is why I made it a priority of mine to learn the identity of that man. That was years ago, i remember like it was yesterday. Now my scales are coarse and protect me under my own silks as I stride forth into the world.

		Hisssssss!  You fleshies have no clue do you? You are born into this world with a family group, and safety. My fellow sisters and brothers wake up in a shell, this is our first problem in life, because we have to break out. Once free, it is a mad dash to what we hope is safety. My fellow Hatchlings from my vacinity chose to follow me, luckily I found a guard who picked us up and carried us to town.
