	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:12;top:57;width:538;height:739;color:#d1d5f8;">
		<OL TYPE=1>
			<LI> The raid you plan should be for your level or lower.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=2>
			<LI> Ensure attendance by advertising your raid (Guild MOTD, News section, Calendar and forum) and planning far enough in advance for word to get around.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=3>
			<LI> Plan only one raid at a time. This reduces confusion and allows others a chance to plan raids. You can plan multiple raids and announce them, however they should be far enough apart to allow others to squeeze in their needs.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=4>
			<LI> Have clear goals and announce the goals to the raiding party so that everyone is on the same page.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=5>
			<LI> Announce how to handle loot prior to raid. Need before greed, alpha, first loot first serve, or magic dice rolling.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=6>
			<LI> Create chat channel with a name easy to spell or know (Example: /join Brewer {gnoll brewer raid in Blackburrow})
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=7>
			<LI> Choose group leaders who you know will conduct themselves well with you, or that you know personally 
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=8>
			<LI> Establish "safe spots" when moving to the raid area. Healers need to med to keep their mana. Oh yea, no mana, no heal. Same with other casters.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=9>
			<LI> Make sure everyone knows not to pass you unless running to next safe spot, and stand where people shouldn't pass.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=10>
			<LI> Know the area very well before you get there. Study maps on eqatlas and print them out. If possible, scope out the area before the raid.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=11>
			<LI> Explain politely how to use necessary things such as /assist and not to break mez to people who don't understand. Try to be patient with people who are following the rules and trying.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=12>
			<LI> You have the option to remove people from the raid who are transgressing or going against your commands in the raid.
		</OL>
		<BR>
		<OL TYPE=1 START=13>
			<LI> You are not required to wait for people who are late nor send them guides. This choice is at your discretion. 
		</OL>
