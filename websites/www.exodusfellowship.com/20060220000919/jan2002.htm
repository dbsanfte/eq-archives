            <font color="#FFFFCC">Sorry there has been a lack of activity on this page. First my computer
was nearly unuseable, and now work, as well as a couple of freelance
jobs, have been taking up much of my time. If any of you want a NEWS
story to appear on this page, feel free to email it to me. If the
article is written with all the correct info and is complete, it's
really just a matter of copying and pasting!

guildmates, Ursi Major is our first recipient of our highest honor, The
Medal of Honor. Not only has she always been available to lend a
helping hand, she often puts the needs of others before herself. <br>
She has also been involved in putting together many guild events as
well as recruiting quite a fair share of new members! Ursi has always
gone above and beyond the call of duty, and she is most deserving of
this medal.</font>

The first is how I used to look. The middle shot is the aged me after
the Luclin expansion was released. The third shot is how I now look if
you don't have the Luclin expansion or the Half Elf models turned on.
Somehow, my face has changed! And what's with the pompadour? I
discovered this because I was in a zone with particularly bad lag so I
turned off all of the new Luclin models, imagine my horror when I
didn't even recognize myself! Anyway, I find it somewhat bothersome
that your own vision of how you look is not neccesarily how others see
you.</font>
