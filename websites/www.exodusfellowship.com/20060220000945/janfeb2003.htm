            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">Both Qural (55 EF cleric) and Angeliqe (63 CoS cleric) obtained their
cleric epic - The Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankah this weekend. Both
guilds participated in successful back to back slaughters of Ragefire .
A great demonstration of alliance teamwork. This epic is probably the
most important one for a guild. The effect right click rez makes any
guild raid go much smoother after a wipeout. Thank you very much to
both guilds and all who attended.</font>

will make limited CDs available for those with a slow connection, or no
credit card account. Though the CDs won't be available until a couple
of weeks after the expected launch date of February 24th. The expansion will also feature a new guild management system which should prove useful to Leaders and Members alike.</font>

            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Exodus Fellowship is becoming very well known for it's kindness,
kinship, and friendly atmosphere. The word has gotten out. This has
provided us with a recent influx of new members. We have been blessed
with some new and very good members, but many of us feel that we are
growing too fast. In fact, some of us have not had a chance to get to
know everyone yet. Therefore, we have decided to put a halt on
recruiting temporarily. Let's take this time to get to know one
another, and look inward for help and guidance, rather than outward.
Reach a hand out to a fellow guildmate that you have not met before.
Group with that quiet guy that you don't know yet. We are all here
together and should help each other, and grow together.<br>
		<br>
There will be a FEW exceptions to the no-recruiting policy. Real life
friends and family are still welcome, as are alts. Exodus has a few
weak areas as far as what classes we have. Applicants that fill one of
these weak areas MAY be considered. The High Council has placed Cobo
and Ashmael in charge of deciding what exceptions are necessary. Please
help them in their new roles.</font>		
            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">Thanks everyone!</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">1/23/03 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Awards!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">On Monday, January 13th, The Exodus Fellowship met in the EC tunnel and
some announcements and awards were distributed (along with some fine
ales!). Here is an account of what awards were bestowed:<br>
		<br>
The Medal of Contribution is given to those members who go above and
beyond the call of duty when it comes to helping the guild, either in
game, or out of the game. This medal goes to Niniane, Tacomir, Karmyn,
Rivin, Ashmael, Evellyn, Boffle, and Chonn. Please congratulate these
members and thank them for their support. <br>
		<br>
The Rescue Medallion is given to those members who are successful in
retrieving corpses from very dangerous places. Karmyn has been awarded
this Medallion for her work in Dalnir. Congratulations, Karmyn!<br>
		<br>
		One of the most coveted awards is the Lemming Award.  This is earned by dying repeatedly in less than necessary situations.  <br>
		<br>
This esteemed award has been given to Gilgamesch for bravely binding in
the ballroom in Mistmoore, and falling asleep at the keyboard during a
wipeout. Grats, Gil, you earned it!<br>
		<br>
Strangely, and on a separate occasion, Chastisy tried to live up to the
example set by Gil in Mistmoore, and bound herself in the ballroom.
Later, without realizing she was still bound there, she gated. Several
deaths later, grats on your award!<br>
		<br>
There was another incident in the Hole. Apparently Chastisy was leading
Ashmael and Tanluin through Paineel. Well, she fell into the Hole. Like
true Lemmings, Ashmael and Tanluin were right behind her. Grats guys!<br>
		<br>
The Good Conduct Medal is given to members who continually show
selflessness and kindness to their fellow guildmates. These guildies
are a blessing to have among our ranks. The Good Conduct Medal goes to
Daliddar, Krugan, Vessago, and Karmyn. Your work is much appreciated
guys. Keep it up!<br>
		<br>
Last, but not least, the guild's highest award was given out. The Medal
of Honor. This award is not to be taken lightly, and is not given
often. However, there has never been someone more deserving of this
award. In fact, this person is LONG overdue for the Medal of Honor. He
has continuously provided guidance, support, and his wisdom. Without
his help, the guild would not even exist, and definately would not be
the best guild on Povar. Please congratulate the &quot;Father of Exodus
Fellowship&quot;, Kamdar Entil'Zha on his newly awarded Medal of Honor.<br>
		<br>
		To all the awards recipients, congratulations, and thank you!</font></td>
