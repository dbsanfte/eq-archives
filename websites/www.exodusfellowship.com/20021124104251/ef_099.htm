		I was born in Freeport on the continant of Antonica some time ago. <BR>
		<BR>
		I have little memory of my parents. I was very young when they were murdered over taxes by a guard named Lucan. It was at this time that the goddess Erollisi Mar found me. After that I decided to become a good-hearted person, and to love, and respect others. I wandered around till I was about 7-9 years of age in the common lands selling silk and killing orcs when I met a small female named Herbdiva. Shortly after I made the acquaintance of Ursi, and, as you can see I am currently a member of the Fellowship. Herbdiva taught me many things and I am a better person because of it. I still don't like to swim very much, but I do owe her credit for my stellar doggy paddle technique. I currently am in the midst of finding my parent's killer Lucan, and I have found leads that he lives in the very city I was born in. I fight everyday not to loose control and act upon my revenge, but I wonder if I will ever get back what he took from me. <BR>
		<BR>
		To bury my aggressive feelings, I fight in groups, help my fellow guild mates, and complete quests. As life continues its array of ironic circumstances, I find myself back in Freeport to complete a quest. However this quest pins me against Lucan for what is known as the Brilliant Sword of Faith. It tears me apart inside to know that such a vile, corrupt man could ever wield such a marvel to this world. This sword is no mere piece of steel, when combined with the proper hilt, and my Testimony of Truth, it will emit a constant flame that will burn for all eternity. I know that when Erollisi Mar came to me in my youth, that she would not ever abandon me. She must have known that in time I would be strong enough to return to Lucan and exact my revenge. For she must feel, as I do, that the Soulfire blade is the very embodiment of the burning in my heart from all those years ago.<BR>
		<BR>
		Once it is mine, and Lucan is dead, my healing will finally begin. I look forward to the days when I can truly be a child of light.
