		Silence---That was my first memory after I was born in Surefall Glade on <BR>
		Jan. 15, 2001 (Earth time). Save the trickling of the water and the <BR>
		occasional THUNK of an arrow striking the target on the archery range, <BR>
		silence reigned.<BR>
		<BR>
		My mother was killed by the evil gnolls of Blackburrow when I was very young <BR>
		and I was raised by the citizens of Surefall. I never knew my father. I <BR>
		spent my early years seeking revenge for my mother's death.<BR>
		<BR>
		The hills of Qenyos and the surrounding areas were my hunting grounds for <BR>
		many seasons.  Seekings solitude, I mostly hunted alone.  A certain amount <BR>
		of revenge was exacted for my mother's death but I was not satisfied.  Quite <BR>
		probably, I will never be truly happy until the evil members of the Clan <BR>
		Sabretooth are wiped from the face of our lands.<BR>
		<BR>
		It was also during this period that recurring rumors circulated regarding my <BR>
		father's identity.  It was said that my father was a barbarian from the <BR>
		north named Gilgamesch.  I found this difficult to believe as I felt my <BR>
		mother could not possibly love a barbarian.  I had very little contact with <BR>
		members of this race but had heard they were a cruel and vicious people.  I <BR>
		did, however, reserve judgement until additional information became <BR>
		available.<BR>
		<BR>
		During my 10th season, I ventured to the nearby Karana's to further my <BR>
		education regarding the world around me.<BR>
		<BR>
		One day, during a fishing trip near the barbarian village in West karana, I <BR>
		chanced to meet Gilgamesch.  To my surprise, he seemed to be a kind, <BR>
		generous and gentle soul.  After seeing my lack of decent equipment, he gave <BR>
		me some items that, to him were the spoils of conflict but, to me, were very <BR>
		much appreciated and needed.  He not only would not take payment for the <BR>
		items but bestowed upon me his greatest gift.  He told me of his adventures <BR>
		and guided me to further pursuits.  The knowledge he imparted was to prove <BR>
		invaluable in the coming years.<BR>
		<BR>
		I never broached the subject of my parenthood and, in our few chance <BR>
		encounters later, have never mentioned the subject.  Perhaps, one day, the <BR>
		truth will surface.  It still boggles my mind that a man so large and <BR>
		imposing and with eyes as cold as a winter's lake could be so different than <BR>
		what appears on the surface.  Perhaps, one day, that relationship may change <BR>
		but he will remain my friend, regardless.<BR>
		<BR>
		Our ways have parted and our paths have not crossed of late.  I continue my <BR>
		adventures and enjoying new places and seeing new things.<BR>
		My admission into Exodus Fellowship has done much in those areas.<BR>
		<BR>
		I am a druid.  I love the earth and, to this day, continue my quest to rid <BR>
		our world of evil. The memory of my mother's death is etched on my soul and <BR>
		I will never forget her.
