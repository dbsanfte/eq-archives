		<p><font color="#FFFFCC">Sorry about the lack of updates.  We are going to try and get this News section going again with at least<br>
1 or 2 updates a week. We know that you have gotten out of the habit of
checking this section, so when there is an update, a message will
appear at the top of the forum telling you so. Hopefully this section
can become another interesting place to visit on our website.. If you
have any News related stories or articles that you would lile to submit
for this section, just right it up as completely as possible, send it
to kamdar@exodusfellowship.com, and it will be posted here.</font>		
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Gallery Section Updated!
            </font></b>		
            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">At last the pictures from our Stonebrunt Mountain Raid are up in the Gallery section.  So take a peek!  <br>
		This is the biggest gallery collection yet, and that's only fitting since it was also our biggest raid!<br>
		Thanks to Thallus and Gilgamesch, who both contributed some nice shots!</font>		
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Upcoming Raids...
            </font></b>
            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">There are two raids being planned for the weekend of the 22nd! First on
Saturday we will be storming Castle Mistmoore and on Sunday we will be
taking another plunge down the Hole! Please keep an eye on the Forum
and the Events Calendar for all the latest details.</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">5/13/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Fishing Contest Postponed
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">The fishing contest that was to be hosted by Arri this Wednesday night
has been postponed until further notice. Arri has been a little under
the weather but doesn't want the contest to go on without her! So keep
an eye out for the new date, and don't forget to bring the bait!</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">5/16/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Where's the Forum?!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">It appears our message board and in fact all of EZBoard is temporarily
down. Sorry for the inconvenience. Hopefully it will be back up soon,
maybe even by the time you read this!</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">5/02/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Wacky Wednesday Revisited!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Not another Fishing event! Why yes! Yes it is!! I want to invite all
members of Exodus Fellowship and their friends to come near the bridge
in North Karana (the one that leads to SK). The cost will be 2platinum
pieces per participant, which will be given to Arri prior to the start
of the event. You must come equipped with a fishing pole and 3 stacks
of bait. (no more or less) This event will take place on May 15th at
8pm EST. Be prompt. You are welcome to fish drunk and share ale amongst
your friends. The contest winners will be given cash prizes, booby
prizes etc. You are to use all your bait and then submit to Arri what
you have caught. Winner's will be determined as follows: When the first
person has run out of bait, we will count how many fish each
participant has and a winner will be determined. Then we will continue
fishing and the person with the most junk will win a prize etc. Come.
Come and have a blast fishing with me!!</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">4/28/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">The best guild event ever!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">I have planned out the biggest guild event to date! (i hope) I have
designed it so that all levels (16+) will be able to participate, with
the proper group set up. Everyone will get xp, and there will be a
buffing/rez station to assist everyone! The main goal will be to spawn
the Ancient Titans. I need some of their drops to complete a quest, and
ursi wants a robe from the Panda Titan. <br>
		<br>
		</font><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Here is my plan....<br>
		</font></b><font color="#FFFFCC"><br>
We will all travel to stormbrunt mountains. The mobs in the zone range
from levels 15-45. Most of the High Council and other high level
members will form a safe base. The medium level members (30-40) will
form at least two groups known as Death Squads. The lower level members
will form up groups known as Brute Squads. Each group will be set up to
allow all members to recieve xp.<br>
		<br>
The safe base is there for you to come to for buffs / heals / rezes,
and to bring any unwanted mobs you may have agroed along the way. The
two Death squads will circle the Safe base killing pandas and monkeys
to get the two Titans to spawn (monkey and bear) that i need for my
quest. some of these placeholders were blue to me at level 40. The
brute squads will camp the kobold camps for xp, and can pull higher
level mobs from around them if needed.<br>
		<br>
Because the Death squads will be on the move alot, i feel they should
be led by rangers to track down their prey quickly. This is important
because the Death squads will be the driving force behind the Titan
spawn, by killing the placeholders. I would like to hand pick Tanluin
and Thallus as group leaders for the two death squads, and let them set
up their groups as they see fit. Remember, everyone in your groups must
get xp! Contact them prior to the event if you want to be part of a
Death Squad!<br>
		<br>
Talk among yourselves to decide who will form up a Brute squad. Post
here the groups that you decide, not to mention support for this event!
<br>
		<br>
I have made a map of the zone, with some drawings to help illustrate
the plan. just cklick on the link. As you can see, everything is near
the river so it wont be hard to find each other. Just follow the river!
I will be porting the day before and the morning of, i will also be
escorting people through the warrens for an hour or so before the event
starts. This event is scheduled for May 12 (Sunday), at 11:30 EST and
should last about 4 Hours. If there are any suggestions or
comments/questions, post here or send me an email at
            </font><a href="mailto:cobokelvar@yahoo.com"><font color="#FFFFCC">cobokelvar@yahoo.com</font></a>
