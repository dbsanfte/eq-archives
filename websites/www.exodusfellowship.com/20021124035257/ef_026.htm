		My first advance outside of the Kelethin region was at the expense of many a Crushbone Orc.  It is here I practiced the Ranger skills of tracking and foraging.  These abilities made it easy for me to find allies in pursuit of glory throughout the area of Crushbone.  My combat skills were put to the test and thanks to my expert counselor, Mayson Trueshot, we did very well financially as well as in battle experience.  After taking all the Crushbone Orcs could dish out and giving it back to them three-fold, it was time to leave Faydwer for greater adventures.<BR>
		<BR>
		I made my way through the Butcherblock Mountains and finally to it's famed port.  My boat came, and just as quickly departed.  This boat ride would forever change my life.  Not only would I be on a new continent, but I would later see cities of unrivaled size and enlightenment.<BR>
		Freeport had everything a Wood Elf would need within a stones throw, except my beloved forest and fair market prices.  It seems as if you were not native to their city then you would pay the price, literally.  Many races and classes filled the streets as I readied myself for gainful adventures.  I have heard of numerous Orc Camps in the nearby Common Lands and their belts brought great reward.  My history with fighting Orcs has been very profitable so I hastily made way to these camps.  I believe my time fighting these Orcs would have been useless if not for the platinum received for the belts off these Orcs.  I did however, run into a Druid wise beyond her years.  She called herself Arri. <BR>
		<BR>
		Arri began to tell me a story of fellowship, great battles, and selfish leadership.  You see, Arri was a member of a good guild gone bad and was seeking a home with selfless values.  After we exchanged more and more war stories and the struggles we had each faced, we found more things in common and promised to message each other from time to time.  One of these messages brought me to the tunnels that connect the Great Desert of Ro with the Common Lands.  It was here that I learned much more about Arri's history with her former guild.  I met other disgruntled members and former members of this group, and this is where it happened.  This is where I found my family.  Arri, and a Ranger of superior skill and prowess, named Kamdar, stepped forward and called for our allegiance to the common good of all adventurers.  Many of us in attendance stepped up right away, while others debated.  I listened to Arri and Kamdar and knew this was the right place, at the right time, and I became a member of Exodus Fellowship.  Later in the evening after much celebration of the guild's formation I had an honor of which I have never felt placed upon me.  I was asked to become an Officer of what I believe to be the greatest single movement in Norrath.  I paused for a moment to reflect upon myself, and to determine if I was ready to commit the time and effort that would be needed for such a movement to be successful.  I graciously accepted the position and have dedicated all that I am to the betterment of our society that is Exodus Fellowship.<BR>

		This is Tanluin's story.  The story of a young Wood Elf Ranger who left his home in order to find his calling of glory and worth, but ironically found his family and identity.

		It all began one stormy night in Kelethin, the Tree City in Faydwer and native homeland for the Wood Elves. As a Wood Elf I quickly became fascinated with the skills of the men and women of Faydarks Champions.  Maesyn Trueshot took me under his wing and began to show me the ways of the Wood Elf Ranger.

		As I advanced in skill and ability it was obvious to my instructor, and myself, that it was time to venture off on my own in order to further develop my skills. Prior to leaving Kelethin I knew I must obtain a marketable skill in order to barter with various tradesmen in Norrath.  I quickly advanced my skills in Fletching and Tailoring, not to the level of Master, but to a level of modest efficiency in order to get by on my own.  These skills have served me well in hunting and in exchange.
