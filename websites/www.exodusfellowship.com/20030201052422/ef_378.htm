		Felwithe--A city of great majesty and populated with citizens of high intelligence and moral standards.  It was at the gates of this great city that I was orphaned.<BR>
		<BR>
		I knew not my parents and, lacking guidance, I ventured into the city. After wandering around for a few minutes, I politely asked for directions to the Enchanters guild so that I may begin my life on Norrath properly equipped.<BR>
		<BR>
		Almost immediately, an enchantress not only escorted me to my guild but bestowed upon me the sum of 157 platinum pieces to aid me in my travels.  Alas, I have long since forgotten her name.<BR>
		<BR>
		I then ventured into the woods of Greater Faydark where I spent 6 seasons killing the creatures that abound there.<BR>
		<BR>
		My future, which was destined to become a jeweler was started during that time.<BR>
		<BR>
		After 6 seasons, I tired of the incessant buying and selling in the zone and purchased a teleport to North Karana. From there, I ran to Qenyos and have lived (and died) in the Karanas since that time.<BR>
		<BR>
		In the ensuing 17 seasons, I have flourished and become a Master at Jewelcraft and Pottery so that I may be of some assistance to my friends and new family.<BR>
		<BR>

		Master Jeweler<BR>
