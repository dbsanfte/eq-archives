            <font color="#FFFFCC">The results were: the team of Arathain, Xzii, Tyrrarius and Pearll won
first place. Second and third place tied: the team of Berina and Sindee
and the team of Atraedes and his alts. Although death threats were made
against my person, I think everyone had fun. Lol, not sure that they
liked my list. My personal favorite was the 7 lb. fetid bass. You get
that from fishing in Cabillis.</font>

            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">7/22/03 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Scavenger Hunt!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">It is at 3:00pm Eastern on Saturday, July 26th. It will be a team
event. Your team can consist of 1-6 players between levels 10-65. I
only ask that there be a limit of one porter per group. You can get
your team together before the event. Or if you don't have a team, come
to the vendor room in the east commons tunnel before the hunt starts
and group with whoever else shows up there without a group.<br>
		<br>
It will start promptly at 2:00pm and ends promptly at 3:00pm. You are
still welcome to participate if you are late, but there won't be any
additional time granted. There are a total of 40 items on the list,
which you may hunt or purchase. Whoever turns in all 40 items first to
me in the EC tunnel wins. Or if time has run out, whoever has the most
items. And when time runs out, you must be in the east commons tunnel
for the turn in count. However, you may start in any zone you like.
Shotgun start. I will spam the first 10 items thru guild chat at
2:00pm. The others at 15 minute intervals.<br>
		<br>
		There will be a first, second and third place prize. And refreshments afterwards. Everyone come and have fun. <br>
		<br>
		Remember, it's at 3:00pm Eastern... That's 2pm Central, 1pm Mountain, and Noon Pacific time.  This Saturday!</font>
