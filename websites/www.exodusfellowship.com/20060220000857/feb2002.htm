</font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">I am pleased to announce that original co-leader of the Exodus
Fellowship, Arri Ghent, has rejoined the leadership in the High
Council. While other more pressing matters forced her to take a leave
of absence from the High Council, her presence has always remained an
important part of our Fellowship, and we are honored to have her back
with us where she belongs!</font>
		<p><font color="#FFFFCC">&nbsp;</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Exodus Honor Guard is Final...sort of...
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Congatulations to Herbdiva, Foreest and Lanashay for being voted into
the Exodus Honor Guard! Arri was also voted in, but has been promoted
back into the High Council to replace the dearly departed Mysty. Look
for another member to join the EHG on Monday!</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">2/19/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Guild Magic Wants You!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Or rather, I want all of you in Guild Magic! I don't know if any of yop
are aware of this site, but it's a pretty good one, and many guilds use
it. It's a complete guild and character database that you can update
yourself. When you ding or improve your level in a skill, you can log
on and change the info yourself. This thing keeps track of everything
from awards to alternates, and you can even get your characyer's
picture on there. Hopefully down the road this will save me untold
hours of updating the website. Eventually I hope to incorporate Guild
Magic into our own site as many other guilds have. The only trade off
is, we have to adapt to those crazy Guild Magic colors of blue and
pink! But, they may have a fix for that in the future.</font>		
            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">So here's what I need eveyone to do...<br>
		Go to www.guildmagic.com<br>
Create a username and password. This does not have to be your
character's name. Then Add your characters to Guild Magic. You can put
in as much detail on your character as you wish... the more the better.
Then you can add him/her to a guild. Uh, pick Exodus Fellowship, ok?!
You won't appear on the roster right away, I have to accept you first.
Then yer done!</font>
            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">I know this is a little extra work to ask of you all, but the website
has become a rather monstrous undertaking, and I'm hoping to make it
easier for all of us down the road.</font>
            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">ARCHIVE NOTE: Guild Magic is now defunct.</font></p>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">2/16/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Rathguard hosts Befallen Raid
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Our latest raid is designed for some of our younger members. If you are
in the 10 to 25+ level range, please join Rathguard on Wednesday night
at 8:30pm EST as he plunders the depths of the ancient temple now known
as Befallen. If you are a member above the recommended experience
range, but would like to offer support, you are most welcome to join
in. Click on the link below for more info and maps on Befallen.</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">2/04/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">February Medals!
            </font></b></p>
		<font color="#FFFFCC">Well it's awards time again, and this month  several of our oldest members earned commendations.<br>
		<br>
		The Medal of Contribution goes to Tanluin for donating to the cost of this site!<br>

The Rescue Medallion is being awarded to Danmann for his valiant
efforts in dragging his fellow guildmates bodies to safety during the
Castle Mistmoore raid.<br>
		<br>
For participating in a large number of our guild events, and always
offering help and support, and for their winning attitudes, Herbdiva
and Niarki are both being awarded the Good Conduct Medal.<br>
		<br>
And for his exceptional abilities as a raid leader, Khaba is being
awarded the Medal of Leadership. During our raid in Kedge Keep, we did

            </font><a style="color: rgb(137, 176, 235);" id="A31" href="mailto:kamdar@exodusfellowship.com" onmouseover="if(V4) OnOver(0,IDP[9],0,0,0,'kamdar@exodusfellowship.com',1)" onmouseout="if(V4) OnOver(0,IDP[9],'#89b0eb',0,0,0,0)"><font color="#FFFFCC">kamdar@exodusfellowship.com</font></a><a style="color: rgb(137, 176, 235);" id="A31"><font color="#FFFFCC">.</font></a><font color="#FFFFCC">
Let's see if we can get
some of our other worthy members recognized!</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">2/03/02 - </font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Get your votes in!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Hail Exodus Fellowship! I thank you for your participation regarding
the nomination process of the initial class for our Exodus Honor Guard.
In no particular order the finalists are as follows: Arri, Ashmael,
Macolic, Herbdiva, Niarki, Lanashay, Qural, Foreest, and Chonn.<br>
		Please email up to two votes to Tanluin_Atrackin@yahoo.com. <br>
The role of the Exodus Honor Guard is to assist the High Council in
expanding our ranks (ie recruiting). By installing the Exodus Honor
Guard we are allowing ourselves to reach more classes and levels within
Norrath in an effort to make our Guild the best it can be. The High
Council will remain the governing body of the guild and as always
remains open minded to your concerns and opinions.<br>
		<br>
If you are a finalist and you are not interested in the position please
send me an email or send me/other High Council member a tell in-game
stating such. You will not be considered regardless of the voting
results if this is the case. The High Council respects your feelings
and would not want to place you in a position you do not want.<br>
		<br>
The voting period will be about 2 weeks in duration and dependant on
your participation. If I'm still recieving votes the polls will remain
open. We will post in Forum and on MOTD when the voting period is
closed.</font>
