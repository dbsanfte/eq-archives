		March Awards!

		Congratulations to our latest award winners! <BR>
		<BR>
		Arri Ghent is the latest recipient of the Medal of Leadership.  In or out of the High Council, Arri has always been in the thick of things.  whether it's planning one of her many Wacky Wednesday events or being the voice of reason when when things get a little tense, Arri has always shown us that she is a natural born leader!<BR>
		<BR>
		Our Medallion of Excellence goes to Chonn Kelvar and Agradeleous Stormhelm, both of whom are terrific role-players.  Chonn for his endless tales of Barbarian hardship and Aggy for his sharp tongue, and questionable Dwarf wit, have added a great deal of fun to this Fellowship.<BR>
		<BR>
		The Heart of Sacrifice goes to Macolic.  This insane Monk is constantly risking himself and dying for the safety of the rest of his group.  He has been known to disband and take the brunt of a creatures attack so that the rest of his party can escape.<BR>
		<BR>
		Nudle receives our Good Conduct Medal.  His  participation IN-GAME and out is second to none!  He's participated in just about everything since joining  the Guild and is constantly going out of his way to assist fellow Guildees.<BR>
		<BR>
		The Medal of Contribution goes to Arri, Mantrena and Arathain for their generous contributions to the cost of this website!<BR>
		<BR>
		And The Medal of Honor is awarded to Tanluin Atrackin.  Tan has  done a great job at maintaining morale and guild member relations.  The extra work he took on during the voting for the Exodus Honor Guard process was sensational.  While not always in total agreement with the rest of the Council, Tan always speaks his mind and his conscience!<BR>
		<BR>
		Congrtatulation to all the recipients and remember, if you would like to nominate someone, just contact a High Council member via email or send him or her a tell while in Norrath!<BR>
		<BR>

		Hail Exodus!<BR>
		<BR>
		I thought that headline might get your attention!<BR>
		<BR>
		While it has been my greatest pleasure to serve as your leader these past eight months the time has come for me to step down from my position, and as a member of the High Council.  This decision was not easy for me.  Many factors have come into play, but the main reason is, I am unable to spend a good amount of quality time in Norrath with you.  While I have been working hard behind the scenes, I think it is important that your leader be available in the world of Norrath much more than I am able to be.  Many of you, I have not even met, but through your participation on the Forum and from hearing tales of your adventures I feel like I have gotten to know you.  I don't think there is a better bunch of players in all of Norrath and I have been proud to serve you.<BR>
		<BR>
		My last day as your Leader will be March 13th.  On that Wednesday we will have a small ceremony in the tunnel at East Commons at 9pm EST to announce and toast our new leader.  While this person will be the Head of the High Council, I want to remind all of you that everyone in the High Council is considered a leader in their own right, and has always served this Fellowship well, and will continue to do so.  I can't tell you the amount of emails from me that they have all been putting up with!  They have always acted professionally and with the best interests of the Exodus Fellowship.  They have become my friends, and I will miss my day to day contact with them greatly.  Although I have a feeling I will be seeing many of you "in game" as often as I possibly can.<BR>
		<BR>
		I am not leaving this guild and will still check the Forum everyday.  I will also continue to update the website as much as possible, but I will need help from you folks.  First, you are responsible for updating your own characters through Guild Magic.  This website is a great resource and has been integrated into our new site design.  Secondly, I would hope that you are able to send me NEWS items that I can post in the NEWS section.  These should be announcements of upcoming raids and events that tend to get lost in the shuffle when just posting them in the Forum. Just make sure to give as much advance notice as you can so I can post it and that everyone that needs to, gets the message!  Everyone should probably get used to checking the NEWS section everyday.  Hopefully we will get more activity on it!<BR>
		<BR>
		As I have already said, I am not abandoning this guild.  I will be a proud member until it's final days, which I am sure is a long way off!<BR>
		Our guild is strong and will continue to grow, to push on…to go forth.<BR>
		Please give your leaders the trust, respect and friendship you have given me.<BR>
		And continue the journey with us, as I believe our best days lie ahead.<BR>
		<BR>
		Yours in service,<BR>
		Kamdar<BR>

		You may have noticed that we are now trying out a new message board.  Many guilds use this kind of forum and there are a lot of good reasons why.  Information on certain topics should be easier to find since the board is separated into various categories.  Raids and events can be discussed and planned in it's own section and then we can add them to the calendar when things arefinalized.  The Classifieds Section can replace the WANT ADS link on this page, and you will no longer have to send Ursi emails to add to that page.   Other sections can be added as needed.  Once you have read all the posts you can click on "Mark all forums read"  Then you will be alerted with a little symbol on the side when there are new posts.   You do not have to register to use the forum, but registration comes with added benefits.  Registered members can add a custom signature at the bottom of their posts.  They can add banners or pictures of their characters.  You can also adjust how you view the board.  For instance you can adjust it so that threads with the most recent posts jump to the top.  You will have to be registered if you want to participate in password protected forums such as officer sections.  Also if we institute the poll feature, members will have to be registered to participate.  Registration is fairly painless.  If you do register, it should be your character's name, or as close as you can get to it.  Some names may be taken.  Choose any password you like, but something you can remember. After you sign up and login, you will not have to log in each time you want to post, you will stay logged in unless you press the logout button.  Please give this forum a shot. After a few weeks we will see if you want to keep it.<BR>
