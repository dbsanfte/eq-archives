</font><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFCC">Inside its ranks, all are equal and all are free. Each member is just
as important as the next and all are protected by each other. This is
what makes us strong. Guild representatives fill our leadership
positions and our important decision making processes are left to a
majority vote by the High Council. The High Council is entrusted to
listen to the concerns, ideas and suggestions of the general
Fellowship. Everyone gets a say in the activities of the guild and
everyone is equal. All members are encouraged to bring forth their
ideas for the betterment and growth of the guild. This fundamental
principle is what our guild was founded on, and by upholding this
principle we will ensure our strength in the future. Now, we must move
forward to spread freedom and liberate the oppressed. The goal of
Exodus Fellowship is to band together against tyranny in any form.
