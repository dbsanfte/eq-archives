            due to the addition of the ingame Guild Management tool. It was 
            too much for one person to keep up with adding and removing members 
            from this page.</p>

            to view our old page that contained members and profiles for those 
            members. The information on this page is out of date and some links

            <p align="center">Due to a lot of changes in the membership of this 
            guild over the years, this page now stands as a memorial to those 
            who have made their home at one time within the halls of the fellowship. 
            We salute these past members of our guild as well as the current 
            membership.</p>
