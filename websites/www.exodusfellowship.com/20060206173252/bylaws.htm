members are responsible for knowing and upholding the following Code of
Conduct
</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffffcc" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

BE COURTEOUS</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
kind to others, not only to your brethren but also to non-members of
the guild. Treat them as you would wish to be treated. To treat others
poorly would put a bad light on the guild. The reputation of the guild
is built and established by the daily actions of each and every member
of the guild. Only actions positive to this reputation will be
tolerated. For example, behavior such as kill stealing, foul (and/or
offensive) language are not tolerated. All unguilded alternates are
also subject to this code of conduct. The guilded member will be held
accountable to the alts activities if it infringes on the rights of
other guild members or the reputation of the Fellowship.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman" size="5">2.
BE HONORABLE</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
occasion things can get confusing in the heat of the battle. If this
happens and you accidentally steal a kill or attack a spawn not
realizing someone else was already camping or otherwise engaging that
target, please apologize to the other party (individual) and offer the
loot from the kill to make amends. In most cases this will resolve the
dispute.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman" size="5">3.
NO INTENTIONAL TRAINING OF MOBS</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intentional
training is when one intentionally brings a mob or several mobs to an
area with the intention of letting those mobs wipe out the players
occupying the space. This is a very EVIL practice and will not be
tolerated under any circumstances.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman" size="5">4.
DON'T BEG</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please
no begging for powerleveling, money, items etc. It would put us in a
bad light to beg non guild members. And it would annoy guild members to
be begged for things. Keep in mind we will try and help when we can but
we all have our own worries. When possible, please try to offer goods
and services to your fellow guildmates at reduced prices.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman" size="5">5.
DON"T BE ANONYMOUS </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please
do not play in anonymous mode. Play in the roleplaying mode if you wish
your class or level to remain anonymous. If your guild tag does not
show then there is no point in having one.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman" size="5">6.
ROLEPLAY!</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roleplaying
is highly encouraged! Get into your character. This makes life in
Norrath much more fun for everyone. Write a biography about your
character to post on this site!
</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman" size="5">7.
PLEASE USE THE FORUM! </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New
members are requested to drop by the FORUM and introduce yourself to
the rest of your guildmates within two weeks of joining the guild. If
you are unable to take a few minutes to say hello to your new family,
then this might not the place for you. It is also strongly suggested
that all members visit this website's NEWS section and FORUM on a
regular basis. This will keep you informed as to what is going on.

try and have a good time, we are together as friends and fun should be
a priority.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b><font color="#ffffcc"
 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
guild and its leadership take accusations of inappropriate behavior
(some of which is defined above) very seriously. If a member is accused
of wrong doing it will be investigated by the leadership who will then
decide how to handle the situation once all the facts are known.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an accusation we ask the
guild not to discuss it in guild or open chat until all the facts are
known, and the leadership has had a chance to deal with the situation.
If the action is determined to be severe enough, it is possible the
member will be dismissed from the guild.</font></b><font color="#ffffcc"
