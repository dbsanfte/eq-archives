<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Don't forget the Info Section!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">Our Information section is not only a place for new members to become
acclimated to the Fellowship, but it also serves alot of other
functions as well. From there you can find links to the most popular
and helpful EQ websites. EQ Prices, EQ Atlas and Allakhazam's Magical
Realm are all there, as well as many others. You will also find on site
help. There are guides to get you registered with Guild Magic or our
own Messsage Board. There is even a helpful Guide to EQ Photography
that can get you started as a shutterbug, whether it's to get your own
picture on Guild Magic or send in a submission for the &quot;Featured
Screenshot&quot;. You might have even known that Circle of Shields is our
ally if you hit that little link labeled, &quot;EF Alliances&quot;. So don't
forget about that handy-dandy info section, it's there to help! If you
have anything that you think should be added to the Info area, please
send it along to </font><a href="mailto:kamdar@exodusfellowship.com"><font color="#FFFFCC">kamdar@exodusfellowship.com</font></a>
<p><font color="#FFFFCC">ARCHIVE NOTE: With the site revamp in Sept 2004, this post is not 100% accurate. 
The info section was split into multiple sections.</font></p>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">7/12/02 -</font><font size="4" color="#FFFFCC"> Happy Anniversary!
            </font></b></p>
            <font color="#FFFFCC">It was one year ago today that we formed, and it had been quite a ride!
We have grown much over the past twelve months, but I think our
Fellowship still has the same family and friends atmosphere that we had
when it all started, and I have been proud to be a part of such a
friendly group. If you would like to read of our guild's beginnings,
the story is unfolding this month in our &quot;Tales of the Fellowship&quot;
section of our forum.<br>
		<br>
		Please remember to visit the Forum and Calendar often, as more events will be added for this, <br>
		our Anniversary month.<br>
