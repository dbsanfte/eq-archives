            <font color="#FFFFCC">From time to time, the EF recognizes members for the dedication and
honor they bring to the Fellowship. These guild-mates as well as many
others, go above and beyond the call of duty. Alot of folks have
obtained their EPICS, so many of these awards reflect that important
accomplishment, which btw... they wouldn't have been able to obtain
without the help and support of so many of our Fellowship. So, thanks
to all that have been so supportive... <br>
		And now, on to the medals!<br>
		<br>
		</font><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Xzii</font></b><font color="#FFFFCC"> is the recipient of the newly created Medal of Participation<br>

		<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Rejoining the Fellowship...
            </font></b>		
            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">The policy for rejoining the Fellowship has been reworked.  Among other things, it now states:</font>
            <p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">&quot;If a member disbands from the Exodus Fellowship they will not be
allowed back into the guild...The HC reserves the right to disband,
remove forum privileges, and delete any posts including re-applications
for disruptive behavior at anytime.&quot;
            </font></b>
		<p><a style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);" id="A21" href="disband.htm" onmouseover="if(V4) OnOver(0,IDP[20],0,0,0,'ef_347.htm',1)" onmouseout="if(V4) OnOver(0,IDP[20],'#ffff00',0,0,0,0)"><font color="#FFFFCC">Please consult this page on Disbanding from the Fellowship for more details</font></a><a href="disband.htm" OnMouseOut="if(V4) OnOver(0,IDP[20],'#ffff00',0,0,0,0)" OnMouseOver="if(V4) OnOver(0,IDP[20],0,0,0,'ef_347.htm',1)"><font color="#FFFFCC">
</font></a>
            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">The link to it (formerly called &quot;Rejoining the Fellowship&quot; is located
in the info section, in the list of links on the right hand side of the
page. And please, think twice before you disband. Often problems can be
worked out without such a rash decision. The best way to work out
problems is to talk about them.</font>
		<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">I WANT YOUR PLAT!
            </font></b>
            <p><font color="#FFFFCC">Just a reminder that it's that time of year again when I beg for your
hard earned cash. The present operation of this site comes to 23.91 a
month. It is my wish to keep this site and the Forum ad free, so if you
can, throw a few dollars my way and you could receive a shiny new
(virtual) Medal of Contribution... And my undying gratitude! For those
of you that have already donated, I salute you!</font>
