		This shot is probably my most complicated so far.  Here's what I did...<BR>
		<BR>
		First, it was really tough just to get the shot!  There is no /archer pose emote that I know of, so you have to be really shooting at stuff.  I got near a tree so I could get a good close shot and by switching to an overhead view, I was able to target the unsuspecting snake or spider.  I turned off the interface then by pressing a hot key I could fire my bow.  It takes a lot of practice to get the timing right when you are hitting that minus key to take the screenshot!<BR>
		<BR>
		Arrows do not show up until after the bow is fired, so that had to be added later.<BR>
		<BR>
		In PhotoShop, I used the lasso tool to cut myself out of Qeynos and put myself in front of a real-life sunset.  I used the Dodge tool to highlight the shinier parts of my armor. I used the paintbrush on a browner hue, to get rid of all pink in my face, and I used the smudge tool to give my hair a little more of a style.<BR>
		<BR>
		I also used the smudge tool to make my fingers look like they were wrapping around the bow more and to furrow my brow a bit so it looks more like I'm concentrating.  I turned up the saturation to bring out the gold in the armor.  The arrow I got from another shot after the bow had been fired.  I cut and pasted it into my picture and added the arrowhead, which I drew using the shape tool and gave it some form using the Gradient blending option.  I also had to draw in the string for the bow!  For some reason my elbow doesn't show in the original shot and I thought it didn't look natural so I drew it in using the Clone tool on my other arm.  There was also an area under my armpit that looked kind of stretched and unnatural, so I used the clone tool there as well.  I made a copy of myself and used the Smudge filter.  It took away alot of detail, but seemed to give me a little more depth.  I erased most of it and the original layer from underneath came back through, but I was still left with a little more muscle!<BR>
		<BR>
		Well, besides playing with the color in the sky, that was about it.  It took alot of work, but I was really pleased with the end result. Obviously learning how to do this took a great deal of time and experimentation, but it is also alot of fun creating something that looks a little better than what you might see in game.
