		"Wield it!  Both hands you froglok!  It is not a wet rope, guide it…Higher, it's too low…You are VULNERABLE!" *whack*  "See, my slowest apprentice could defeat you in two moves, what are you doing here?  *sigh*…One more time, I see some form in you yet." <BR>
		<BR>
		Round and round we went, myself and …HIM.  The sword was awkward in my hands.  Such frustration came from holding tight, yet letting the blade swing around to find it's target - not too often did it do that.  My blade against him and his fighting sword, those bamboo shafts could bring pain that I would question a blade could sometimes.  One move and he changed me, freed me of that torture.  I had landed only once on his lower leg till that moment.  His eyes wide, shock and astonishment…<BR>
		<BR>
		"Up I said!  Gahhh, you are pitiful…"  With that said, he struck my blade to the ground.  Even as tight as I held, going through a thrust he simply plucked it out of my hands.  Next his anger must have released - a flurry of motion and me standing there with nothing but my leather armor and steel bracers from the barracks.  Simplicity came over me, the simplicity of defense.  Survival instincts came out.  Sacrificing hits on my armor where I could gain a strike back, blocking with my bracers…dodging what I could, I survived that attack.  Four times I landed a blow.  Forearm.  Thigh.  Stomach.  Neck.  I feel confident there would have been more if he had not stopped.  Granted, I had welts and was bleeding from more than one place, but I had to show him.  In my strange stance I saw his eyes and more, again he came at me.  His blade met air and earth as it sliced downward where my torso was moments before.  As dirt flew three more blows struck.  Kidney.  Head.  Chest. <BR>
		<BR>
		Breathing hard, his only words… "Master Trann, go to him."  He pointed to a small shack where an old Iksar hermit was watching the skirmish with a sly grin.  As I approached he was judging me, looking at my shape.  He grabbed my arms testing length and strength.  He gestured back toward the sparring area, "What was that all about?  You didn't use your sword, this is not the warrior way.  Why?"<BR>
		<BR>
		"I hate …HIM!  He does nothing to help me train other than -"<BR>
		<BR>
		"Hate is a powerful motivator.  Hate can drive you, pick you up when you're on your last leg, bring you power that was unreachable.  Hate is controlling.  It will taint your soul, and overwhelm you if you succumb even once.  Hate was my driving force…long forgotten hate is." <BR>
		<BR>
		From then on through months of training and sparring with Master Trann did I see the way of the Monk.  He led me to the Court of Pain and told me of journeys I must take, actions I must perform to gain knowledge…power.  A calm controls me, but the Hate is still in me, and we shall see what comes of it.  But for now I live to grow and gain knowledge.  Friends and family I have found.  This Fellowship that came from a Storm, this is where I will grow.  The Court of Pain guides me to a power unreachable as of yet.  Someday will come soon.  <BR>
