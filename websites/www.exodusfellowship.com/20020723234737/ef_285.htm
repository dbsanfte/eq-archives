		About our Vault...
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:58;top:43;width:541;height:700;color:#cbd5fa;">
		The Vault is located in "The Vault" section of our Forum.<BR>
		<BR>
		Bagoloot is the character created to hold Weapons and armor for the guild. He is currently in Freeport, a sexy monk. <BR>
		<BR>
		DevaLee has been created to hold gems, quest items, words, pages and runes.<BR>
		She is presently located in Felwithe<BR>
		<BR>
		Herbdiva and Ladeva are keepers of these characters.<BR>
		<BR>
		CONTAINS: items from guild raids, items guild members long longer need, items looted that your character can not use, lore items, items for crafting. Ex.: gems for the jewelers, pelts you no longer need, etc. <BR>
		<BR>
		DONATIONS: If you have an item you wish to donate to the guild for someone else to use, give it to the vault. All items from the vault will remain possessions of the guild, so when finished with the item please return or give to another guildie. (Craft and Lore items excluded) Let them know that they belong to the guild, please.<BR>
		<BR>
		BORROWING: Let Herbdiva or Ladeva know you want to take something from the guild vault, and Bagoloot will meet you in Freeport or just outside if your of a dark race.<BR>
		<BR>
		WHAT NOT TO BORROW: Things for your alts that are NOT in the guild. Things for others not in the guild.<BR>
		<BR>
		WHAT TO POST:<BR>
		If you wish to use an item from the vault, PLEASE POST UNDER THE POST FOR THAT AND THE TIMES THAT YOU ARE GENERALLY ON. I will try to get it to you. <BR>
		<BR>
		WHAT NOT TO POST: Do NOT post items that you have for the vault to donate and are holding. Also do not post items you are looking for or want to sell, do that in the classified section. And mostly do not leave idle chatter in this section. This is a big task so lets make it easy, please.<BR>
		<BR>
		WHAT IF MORE THAN ONE PERSON WANTS THE SAME ITEM:<BR>
		I will get a number from the competing parties. After I get a number I will do a /random 1 to 1000 and the number that my number is closest to will get the item.<BR>
		I tried to get most of the stats written down and didn't write all of the races and classes that can hold that item
