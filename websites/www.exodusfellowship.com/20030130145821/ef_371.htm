		This story follows a troubled youth in Kaladim through his adventures in Norrath.  As a child my father spent more time drinking dwarven ale with Tumpy Irontoe than at home with his family.  My mother worked 12-hour days at Tanned Assets sewing cloth and leather armor to provide me with food.  Without much parental supervision I had plenty of time to get into trouble.  Vandalism and shoplifting were my everyday activities.  I had never been caught until the day I ventured into the North side of town, and stumbled upon a miner's camp.  Little did I know that mining was just a cover for this group of dwarves.  As I tried to sneak in and steal some meat off of the campfire, one of the miners appeared from the shadows and grabbed me by my shirt collar.  I was scared to death, but oddly the miner wasn't angry.  He shouted to the camp,  Looks like we have a Rogue in training boys.   I sat with the miners and listened to their tales of assassins and thieves.   We ate a hardy feast and laughed the night away.  The following day I began learning the skills needed to become a master rogue. <BR>
		<BR>
		I learned to hide myself and sneak up on unsuspecting targets.  They taught me to steal gold and platinum from the pockets of those who had more than they deserved.  The most important thing I learned was how to inflict huge amounts of damage by sliding my dagger in my enemy's back.    Once I had received sufficient training I left home to master my skills and prove to my King, Bristlebane, that I am worthy of the title  Assassin .  My adventures have led me from the forests of Faydark, to the Deserts of Ro, to the lizard continent of Kunark.  There are many more lands to the see, more platinum to steal, enemies to conquer, and much more to prove. This adventure is far from over...
