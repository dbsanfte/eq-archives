		I became a Half-Elf Ranger when I entered the world of Norrath on March 21, 1999.  I had previously been employed as a research scientist, at the Black Mesa Research Facility working on a top secret government project, until a tear in the space time continuum brought me to your strange and fascinating world.  After a short time of learning my way around Qeynos I soon desired to travel and see more of the world.  I became a mail carrier for a little while picking up a few gold pieces here and there for my troubles.  
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:227;top:947;width:402;height:287;">
		It was during one of my jaunts to Freeport that I joined The Guardsmen of Norrath. At the time, I had no trade and their leader Xentago suggested I become a  linguist, so I expanded my travels throughout Norrath as I learned all of the languages.  I made money by teaching  to others.  Some of the languages were learned by Spellcasters that needed to do research, while others just wanted to learn languages from other lands and peoples.  I came across a lot of friendly and helpful people in The Guardsmen of Norrath, and I was honored to attend a wedding between two of them.    I stayed with that guild for over a year.  During that time many people came and went. There were also several leader changes and finally the guild was disbanded, when there were too few members to carry on.
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:214;top:1234;width:241;height:112;text-align:center;">
		After the Guardsmen split up I left Norrath for several months, not knowing if I would ever return to the lush lands and fertile forests that so enchanted me when I first came into this world. 
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:35;top:1366;width:408;height:273;">
		I had decided to enter Norrath one more time to have a last look around before I cut my ties with this world forever.  But then something unexpected  happened.  I was in Greater Faydark when a call rang out.  A new guild was being formed and they were looking for members.  I thought it might be fun and challenging to be in a guild that was just starting out, and so I accepted their invitation to join The Eternal Stormcallers.  I again started to enjoy the camaraderie and feeling of family and friendship that a guild offers. Some of my very best friendships were formed in this guild. Thanks to the suggestions of others, I was soon made an officer.  Several months passed in which I endeavored to serve The Stormcallers to the best of my ability.  Then a dark cloud fell upon  the guild. 
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:35;top:1646;width:633;height:165;">
		Several of us banded together to discuss our options.  We met in a secret place known only as "The Eye of the Storm". Some decided to stay with the Stormcallers. Others decided to quit and join other guilds. Myself and some others decided it was time to start fresh and create a new guild, bringing with us the best of what we first loved in the Stormcallers and vowing to work hard so that we were not plagued by the same problems that had befallen them .  It was a most difficult time for me.  New friendships were forged, old ones were broken.  But I could not turn my back on what we had started.   I held no animosity against The Eternal Stormcallers, and wished them well.  For some of us, it was just time to move on.  Alas, they have fallen into what was and are no longer eternal.
