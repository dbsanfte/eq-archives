		I was born just before Christmas day in 2001 in the cold of Halas.  I was <BR>
		orphaned at an early age and ventured to Everfrost to find my way in the world.  At an early age, I made friends with a wiser and more experienced Shaman named Thunddarr.  He taught me many things and told me of the world outside Everfrost.<BR>
		<BR>
		At my 6th season, I ventured to the hills outside Qeynos. There I hunted gnolls and many other creatures. I made some ventures to the Karanas as well.<BR>
		<BR>
		The turning point in my life came in my 9th season. It was then that I was invited into a guild, Way of the Wolves. This event took place at a wedding party for the guild leader, Kanwulf and his lady, Elaura.  The party was at the entrance to Surefall Glades. It was my first guild, my introduction to alcohol (strange sensation for the 1st time) and where I met a young druid named Arri.<BR>
		<BR>
		Arri and I became friends and hunted (and died) for quite sometime.  <BR>
		After awhile, we lost contact with one another.  I continued in my solitary <BR>
		manner until March of this year.  At that point, Arri told me of some <BR>
		friends called Exodus Fellowship.  I was invited to join the guild. It was <BR>
		the best thing I have ever done since I started adventuring in Norrath. I have found that this group is my family and I love you all.  We may not be uber in numbers but we are in heart.<BR>
