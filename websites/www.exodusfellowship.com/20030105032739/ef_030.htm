		Ahh the good ol' days, that was back before the orcs invaded my home land, I was 7 when they first attacked us. It was bloody, but luckily our rogues had warned us in time for our neighbor Gnomes to help us build our city in the trees, Tunare bless them gnomes.

		By the time I was 8, I was very good at shooting down orcs from the trees with my bow that my dad made for me. About this time an injured warrior scrambled up the lift one day, and was bleeding profusely from several stab wounds, in his last words, I remember them clearly, he asked me to take his sword and continue the fight for my home land, and never to let the orcs rule over anyone. I took his sword in my small hands, and lifted it into the air, and promised to him I would. That is the day I became a man, and a warrior. My dad saw what I had done, and ran back to our house to grab some banded armor that was once his when he was my age. I put it on and nearly fell over, my mom gave me a stength buff, and I steadied my stance some.<BR>
		<BR>
		From that day on, I killed orcs blow for blow in their faces, up close and personal.<BR>
		Now it was about this time, that I began my great journeys across Norrath, to discover the root of the orc plague and expel it. Well in my youth, I didn't expect the problem to be as big as it truely was. Maybe it was the herbs I was foraging or just my loud stereo in my helmet that kept me from realizing it until i did. My travels led me to the Home of the Innrouk's children, commonly referred to as Dark Elves, or smurfs, but don't let that name fool you, there are no papa smurfs among these people. I annoyed these people for a long time by removing their outer most defenses, and as I grew, my attacks got closer and closer to their home. Oh but, I hardly spent all my time there, for my anger was not that strong to out do my playfullness, and curiosity.  I have traveled Norrath quite extensively, you name the place and I will most surely know where you are talking about, and what it looks like. I have seen some sights that would make the ordinary wood elf pee in his pants. But of all the places I have been I am still most comfortable in the trees of my home town, but then again who isn't?

		Hi, names Khaba Mitaba. One of the bravest fighters to emerge from Faydwer, in my own mind that is, and in the minds of  many other people I have come across.  My Dad was a Ranger, until he retired, mom...a druid, and she still wanders about the woods with my dad running behind hehe.
