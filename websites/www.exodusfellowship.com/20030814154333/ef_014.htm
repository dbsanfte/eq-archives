		To take a picture while in the game press the minus sign on the number pad. Keep in mind that most pictures look alot nicer if you press F10 to remove the User Interface.  Have fun and experiment!  With practice you can take great action and nicely composed scenic shots. And you don't ever have to worry about running out of film!  Just be careful you don't get killed in those dangerous situations!  If you are taking action or character shots, remember, closer is always better!  Also the higher your screen resolution is set, the more detailed your pictures will be.  I have my resolution set at 1024 x 768 but you can also get some nice shots at 800 x 600.  Anything below that and your quality will really suffer. Here are a few tips for taking profile type shots of your fellow guildmates:

		This shot is probably my most complicated so far.  Here's what I did...<BR>
		<BR>
		First, it was really tough just to get the shot!  There is no /archer pose emote that I know of, so you have to be really shooting at stuff.  I got near a tree so I could get a good close shot and by switching to an overhead view, I was able to target the unsuspecting snake or spider.  I turned off the interface then by pressing a hot key I could fire my bow.  It takes a lot of practice to get the timing right when you are hitting that minus key to take the screenshot!<BR>
		<BR>
		Arrows do not show up until after the bow is fired, so that had to be added later.<BR>
		<BR>
		In PhotoShop, I used the lasso tool to cut myself out of Qeynos and put myself in front of a real-life sunset.  I used the Dodge tool to highlight the shinier parts of my armor. I used the paintbrush on a browner hue, to get rid of all pink in my face, and I used the smudge tool to give my hair a little more of a style.
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:9;top:158;width:389;height:123;color:#d8e0fe;">
		I’ve often asked people to send me screenshots.   Whether it be for a character shot, or a featured screenshot... Some of you don’t know how to do it,  while there may be some others of you that want to learn how to do more with your pictures.  This guide now features some before and after shots near the bottom of the page that detail some of the tweaks I do with my photos.  Whatever the reason you may want to know more about  taking pictures in Norrath and beyond... this little guide should help you out!
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F04 STYLE="left:9;top:291;width:174;height:30;color:#d5defd;">
		Taking Screenshots...
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:14;top:1985;width:631;height:117;color:#d8e0fe;">
		First I'll show you what not to do!  Foreest was kind enough to take his own picture and send it in to me so I could make a shot for him to use with Guild Magic.  As you can see in the first picture on the left he is really small and only fills maybe a third of the height of the screen.  He also sent it in at a resolution of 800x600 which wouldn't be bad if he took up more of the screen.  You cannot enlarge a picture like this very much, because the quality really suffers.  Now look at him in the middle picture compared to me.  It's the same shot of Foreest next to a shot of me, but my picture was at a resolution of 1024 x 768.  Foreest barely comes up to my kneecap!  The next shot Foreest sent me was much better (above right), and that's the shot I was able to use for his picture on Guild Magic. 
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:9;top:507;width:389;height:288;color:#d8e0fe;">
		Crouch Down!  You'll find folks look more heroic when you are looking up at them!<BR>
		<BR>
		Get Close!  Your subject should fill as much of the screen as possible. But, don't cut off raised weapons or their feet, unless you are trying to get in real close!<BR>
		<BR>
		Ask them to cycle through emotes. ie: /point, /cheer, /wave /ready...etc.  <BR>
		<BR>
		Pay attention to the background!  Character shots look alot better if there is not alot of dead bodies littering the landscape or other commotion going on behind them.<BR>
		<BR>
		Use a flash!!  Sometimes it's a little dark in Norrath (not to mention the dark side of the moon!).  Use a Greater Lightstone or other means of illumination to light up your subjects!<BR>
		<BR>
		Also, you may want to remind them that they will not be able to talk to you for as long as you have the User Interface switched off!
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F04 STYLE="left:9;top:825;width:174;height:22;color:#d5defd;">
		Self Portraits...
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:9;top:852;width:389;height:138;color:#d8e0fe;">
		Taking great self portraits is really not too hard.  The trick is to press the F9 key and cycle thru the views til you get to one of the choices that lets you swing the “camera” around, using the mouse. I find its easier if I am facing a wall or a tree, then I can get as close a shot as I want. Remember to hit the F10 button to get a view that is uncluttered with text. If you want, you can even get rid of the floating name over your head, by checking that option off, in your display options.  It's always easier to touch up the shot later if you don't have that floating name in the picture.

		Viewing your shots...

	<DIV CLASS=F04 STYLE="left:10;top:1139;width:174;height:22;color:#d5defd;">
		Retouching photos...
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:9;top:1028;width:389;height:107;color:#d8e0fe;">
		To view the pictures you’ve taken, you will have to look them up in the EQ directory. Use My Computer or Windows Explorer to find the directory. The default location is C:/Program Files/EverQuest. Click on the Everquest directory and you can see all of the shots you have taken listed as bitmaps. They will look something like this…EQ000001. Click on the file to view it!
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:9;top:1167;width:389;height:138;color:#d8e0fe;">
		If you own a photo editing program, you can do all kinds of retouching, and even add special effects to your photos.  The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.  There are a lot of programs out there and they range in price from ablot 50 bucks to several hundred.  Two of my favorites are PhotoShop and PhotoImpact.  The later can be purchased for around 80.00 and is fairly simple to learn.  PhotoShop is the premier editing tool and had a much greater learning curve. It is also much more expensive at around 600.00.  Below are some shots that show you what is possible with a nice photo editing program.
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F04 STYLE="left:10;top:1327;width:279;height:41;color:#d5defd;">
		Getting your pix on the web!
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:9;top:1354;width:389;height:258;color:#d8e0fe;">
		Most pictures on the internet  are one of two files types: jpegs or gifs.  Gifs are good for pictures with text and motion, like some advertising banners.  Jpegs are the best for showing off photos.  So Jpegs are what you would normally be dealing with.  The pictures start out as a bitmap file, so you would have to change it to a jpeg before it's ready for the web.<BR>
		<BR>
		Pictures can take a long time to load on a webpage.  So it's important that you do what you can to keep your picture's file size down.  You can have two shots that look pretty much identical, they can even have the same dimensions, yet one of them loads quickly and the other does not.  The shot that came up right away was compressed, also done with photo-editing programs.  <BR>
		<BR>
		You will also need a place on the web to put your shots.  There are various web-hosting & photo hosting sites.  They range in price, but some are still free!

	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:9;top:1680;width:389;height:103;color:#d8e0fe;">
		Of course the easiest thing to do would be to send me your pix via email and I will use this website to store them.  <BR>
		<BR>
		Once your photos are on the web, you just need to use your photo's web address or URL to call it up, use it in a post, upload it to Guild Magic or whatever.

		These side by side comparison shots really illustrate just what's possible when using a powerful photo editor like PhotoShop.<BR>
		The first shot shows that with a little highlighting of the armor, Nerion can seem to pop out of the picture.  This was done by using PhotoShop Dodge tool.  The relection on the weapon was done with a lens flare effect.  Both PhotoShop and PhotoImpact have the lens flare effect but believe it or not, PhotoImpact's version of it is more versitile and user friendly!<BR>
		<BR>
		The close up of Gilgamesch shows what a little shading and using a PhotoShop filter called Liquify can do.  Liquify is very similar to PhotoShop's smudge tool, but it has many more variations.  Using it, I was able to give Gil a slight smirk.  I was also able to smooth out the horns on his helmet and make his eyes a little bigger.<BR>
		<BR>
		The shot of Ashmael shows what he looks like against a different background.  This one was taken from real-life.  I used PhotoShop's lasso tool to cut and paste Ash into the new background.  I used the paintbrush and selected Hue to change the color of the sky.  I also did a little highlighting of Ash's gold medallion on his chest.
	</DIV>
	<DIV STYLE="left:11;top:2550;width:400;height:309;">
		<A HREF="ef_404.htm">
		<IMG SRC="example_18s.jpg" ALT="" ALIGN=TOP BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0>
		</A>
	</DIV>
	<DIV CLASS=F02 STYLE="left:6;top:2911;width:680;height:214;color:#d8e0fe;">
		I also used the smudge tool to make my fingers look like they were wrapping around the bow more and to furrow my brow a bit so it looks more like I'm concentrating.  I turned up the saturation to bring out the gold in the armor.  The arrow I got from another shot after the bow had been fired.  I cut and pasted it into my picture and added the arrowhead, which I drew using the shape tool and gave it some form using the Gradient blending option.  I also had to draw in the string for the bow!  For some reason my elbow doesn't show in the original shot and I thought it didn't look natural so I drew it in using the Clone tool on my other arm.  There was also an area under my armpit that looked kind of stretched and unnatural, so I used the clone tool there as well.  I made a copy of myself and used the Smudge filter.  It took away alot of detail, but seemed to give me a little more depth.  I erased most of it and the original layer from underneath came back through, but I was still left with a little more muscle!<BR>
		<BR>
		Well, besides playing with the color in the sky, that was about it.  It took alot of work, but I was really pleased with the end result. Obviously learning how to do this took a great deal of time and experimentation, but it is also alot of fun creating something that looks a little better than what you might see in game.
