		This quest has become the only goal in my life. To seek this knowledge I have traveled through many lands, both hostile and friendly. I enjoyed speaking to the friendly natives and hence learning their knowledge. As for the unfriendly ones, I use my already powerful magic to befriend and trick them into giving me what I seek.<BR>
		<BR>
		I was born an Erudite but in my travels to distant lands in search of the ancient knowledge, I had to adapt various forms to be accepted. You may cross me on the street one day as an Erudite and the next not recognize me as a wood elf. I am the true chameleon of Norath! This trickery has allowed me to pass into many well-guarded places that no normal being could travel.<BR>
		<BR>
		With wisdom and the growth of magic has come power: Rarely do I even need to fight, but when I do, the mightiest find themselves standing stunned and powerless while their life's blood slips away. Warriors swagger and flex their muscles, and do not regard me as a threat. This is my way, but if I chose I have the power to fry their brains inside their helmets!<BR>
		<BR>
		I have found many magical items in my searches that have increased my powers, but always there are rumors of powerful artifacts - greater yet - in faraway lands. So I seek, and continue my effort to expand my mind and powers so that I will have the knowledge and willpower to command the magic of Norath and walk as a Goddess across the lands!<BR>

		I am Niarki Kelvar. I was born in the city Erudin on the tiny continent of Odus. While it is a beautiful and lush homeland I found that it was too small for someone with my curiosity. I felt my potential was being wasted on such a tiny land. So then began my quest. My quest was none other than to seek the ultimate knowledge and expand my mind so that I was the most intelligent and most powerful being in Norrath.
