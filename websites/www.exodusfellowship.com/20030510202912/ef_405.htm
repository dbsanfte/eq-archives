		I became a woodelf druid because I wanted to be apart of the woods.  Since I had a love for  animals it was just what I needed.  At first I must admit it was a bit hard to stay alive with orcs and other things running around trying to kill me, but I somehow made my way to Freeport and hunted there to get some great experience.  I met some very nice folks along the way that helped me in my adventures, and they showed me the way around this big world that I was a bit scared of at first.  But I soon became bigger and could handle myself very well in this big world at least in most places.  I remember entering diffent areas, and thinking will I make it out of here alive?<BR>
		<BR>
		It seems I grew up fast, and had to leave my family so I could see more of this world,  I can't help but wonder how they are all doing since I left them.  Will I ever see mama again?  She is a druid like me , and I learned many things from her.  Oh how I missed my family.   See, my Mama was old, and didn't have much longer to live, but I had to leave her to make something of myself, but I will never forget the day I left, and the look on her sad face. Someday I will make it back to see Mama and she will be so Proud of what I have become. I'm so sure of that. My father was a warrior and died several years ago may he rest in Peace. His memory will live forever in my heart, even though I was just a young girl when he left us.  I have a Sister named Awenna, and she is a bard, and I hear stories about her, and how she can sing so well. I wish I could see her, but our paths have not crossed again. My Brother's name is Ryen, and he is a young warrior and is still with Mama the last I heard, but he was getting stronger everyday, and would be moving on like my sister and I soon, I'm sure.  I have to make my way back to see Mama I'm sure it will a Great Reunion since I have not seen her in several months.  For now, I will contiune to learn more about this world, and try to help others along the way.  <BR>

		One day I was running through Freeport on the way to Befallen, and oh how I hated it there, but some friends were in there and asked me to join them, and to become part of there family.  They were called the Windkeeper, and so being so young and scared I decided there was strength in numbers so I joined them, and was with them for a few months.  Then one day a few of us were unhappy with the lack of leadership, and decided to join a more established guild. That's when I became one of the Immortal Ones, and with them I learned a few things, and made some great friends, but still I was not truly happy. I needed to see so much more,  and they didnt seem to care for me as much as I cared for them.  <BR>
		<BR>
		One day I met a man, his name is Uilan Swiftbow and oh, he was so handsome!   He showed me what a family is all about. That was the day I became a member of Exodus Fellowship.  And I will say from my heart I feel so very Blessed to be a part of such a well rounded guild.  I know not where my life shall lead, but I do know they will be there for me when in need...<BR>
