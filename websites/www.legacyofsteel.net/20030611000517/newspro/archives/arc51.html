We Deliverance'd Tormax (cue             Dueling Banjos).&nbsp; We got medieval on him.&nbsp; We actually had             more than 40 people log in for once.&nbsp; I think our new guild             name, &lt;Zerg Rush&gt;, is really encouraging people to log in             again.&nbsp; King T dropped the Ring, Horn of Hsagra, the Wis Belt             and the Axe.&nbsp; Of course he always drops his head which can be             used for phat caster boots.&nbsp; King T went so well we had plenty             of time to gank the <STRONG>Dain</STRONG> as well.&nbsp; Ok, I am             going to let you in on a little secret.&nbsp; The only reason we             killed the Dain was so that Parv and I could get our Ring 9             containers from the Seneschal.&nbsp; It was pure halfling             favoritism.&nbsp; Super Dain was up.&nbsp; Someone mentioned last             night that Super Dain is the only one that exists anymore.&nbsp; I             seriously hope this is true.&nbsp; Poosae Dain is so fragile I worry             he might die jumping off his bed back there.</P>            <P align=left>By the way, if you thought it was hard getting Frozen             Moses to Kael, you should try getting him from Kael to Icewell then             down the well. . .</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_12/teegoleizogay.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_12/tigolemyleader.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_12/tigoleridesme.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_12/zurgling.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Quote of the             Day</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_12/siddean_quote.jpg"             border=0></P></font><a name="newsitem991983600,30398,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>And Leon's Getting Larger</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Friday, June 8, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>  <P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>LoS Caught             Exploiting!!!</FONT></STRONG> </P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Frozen Moses to be Nerfed!!!</STRONG> </P>            <P align=center><A             href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_8/frozenmoses.jpg"><IMG             alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_8/frozenmoses_small.jpg"             border=0></A></P>            <P align=center><EM>(click on pic for full size image --&nbsp;

We were             doing a standard Tormax run and got caught using our "secret weapon"             by some hidden GMs.&nbsp; As you can see we had Tormax down to about             25% when all of the sudden we released the Sleeper, Veeshan and             Mooto in Kael.&nbsp; Mooto, apparently an enchanter now, charmed the             Sleeper and was raping Veeshan three times till Tuesday until the             GM's brought the zone down.&nbsp; At that point our guild was             disbanded and all 149 of us were suspended.&nbsp; Little do those             stupid GM's know we have since reformed and are now known as             &lt;Zerg Rush&gt;.</P>            <P align=left>Of course, we have been debating our suspension and             disbanding something fierce.&nbsp; After all, if Verant puts             something as powerful and awe-inspiring as Deputy Budo -- a.k.a The             Frozen Moses -- in the game, then why the hell can't we use             him?&nbsp; You think it's easy getting Frozen Moses from Misty             Thicket to Kael?&nbsp; After posting on nearly every message board             and chain-sending Verant hate emails I finally received this             response:</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>Dear Mr. Bitties,</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>According to Verant's rules and             regulations there shall be no charming of "Frozen" biblical             characters for use against uber mobs.&nbsp; This includes the Fozen             Jesus, Frozen Moses, Frozen Noah, Frozen Joshua, even Frozen             Paco.&nbsp; Ok, well, Paco might not have been in the bible but he's             one wicked motherfucker we don't want you charming either.&nbsp;             Whether or not he's actually frozen is beside the point.&nbsp;             Verant employees also witnessed the following quotes in your             guildchat which prove that you are in fact, the Evil Empire in need             of disbanding:</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>"This is our best Tig-sploit             yet"</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>"We're sploiting so hard my balls             ache"</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>"Wow, the mob just hit me.&nbsp;

Verant has hired a man named             Pauly to track you down and bust your fucking kneecaps with a             Louiseville Slugger.&nbsp; We sugest you stick to Minesweeper and             Solitaire and other such games we have no frozen mythical characters             for your exploitation.&nbsp;
