OFFICE</a></strong></font></td></tr></table><p><center>LEGACY OF STEEL PRIMARY UNDERWAY<p>Legacy of Steel members vie for party nomination in Nameless '02 Presidential Campaign.</center><p><strong>NAMELESS</strong> - <strong>MONDAY SEPTEMBER 23, 2002</strong> - It is with great excitement Legacy of Steel formally declares the Legacy of Steel Primary underway.  Three members have announced candidacy in the primary,<p><ul><li><font size=3><strong>Voronwe Thundercat</strong></font></li><br>This post will serve the purpose of allowing YOU, the voters of Norrath, to know what kind of a leader I am, and the changes I hope to make.<p><strong>PROVEN TRACK RECORD</strong><br>Earlier in the year, I noticed an influx in the use of the term "PST" meaning Please Send Tell. Not only was this annoying to read over and over, but it was entirely unnecessary. I mean, is someone gonna come ring your doorbell or send a fax? After discussion with others, I came to the conclusion that all this PST business started when cross server transfers were introduced. Not only was this plague being perpetuated by scum, but it was scum from OTHER SERVERS.<p>So, I started a campaign to help fight this plague and get it off the nameless before it influenced some of our newer players. Reevex of all people joined this campaign, and the battle rages on today. While victory is not yet ours, there are programs in place, and some I would propose if elected to help the fight. More on that later.<p><strong>NEW INITIATIVES</strong><br>1. CLERIC EPIC ISSUES - I've heard from some residents that classes that aren't clerics have been farming the shards needed for the epic and SELLING them. This simply won't be tolerated by me or my administration. Part of the solution will be asking them to leave, and if it keeps up, repeated training. This simply won't be tolerated. Cleric epics help us all. I hope helping clerics will help to allow the community to become closer and there will be more free rezzes for all.<p>2. CLOCKWORK HORSES - it's been suggested that gnomes should have clockwork horses. While gnomes will still be near the bottom of the class and social structure under my leadership, this is something I would look into and likely seek.<p>3. TRADE CHANNEL SCANDAL - While my administration has no official stance on this issue yet, we will look into it and seek something we can all agree on. While it seems bad, Jangos is doing great work on the anti-PST front.<p>4. REEVEX AS VP - if elected, I will offer the title of vice president to Reevex and Minister of Trade to Jangos.<p>5. ROLEPLAYERS - I feel that roleplayers are an important part of our community and would set up a "roleplay friendly environment" - possibly in an arena.<p>6. NEW ANTI-PST MOVEMENT - One option is to NOT BUY ports or items from people use the term PST. Another option is to offer more money if they remove it from hotkeys. The other day I paid a druid 200pp for a port and removal. Her inital asking price for port (with PST attached to the auction) was 75pp. Community involvement is KEY here.<p><strong>FUTURE INITIATIVES</strong><br>ALL changes I make will be with committees. I will use valued members of the community in all decisions I make.<p>I feel I have the experience and drive to deal with any future problems.<p><strong>DEBATE</strong><br>I suggest that a debate be held for all the candidates. It could be done in EQ in an election channel or on NT. <p><br><p><li><font size=3><strong>Mudcrush Durtfeet</strong></font></li><br>Me is ANNOUNCING me candi... candi... uh wut me do...<p>zzz...zzz...<p>*SNORT*<p>ME ANNOUNCE ME IS GONNA BE YUR PREZDENT.
