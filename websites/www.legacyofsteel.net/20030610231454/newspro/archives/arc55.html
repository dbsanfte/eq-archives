Truth is we got caught up in Patch Hell over on The             Gameless server.&nbsp; I don't really find it too exciting posting             the same CT kills over and over.&nbsp; Have I mentioned I *REALLY*             hate patches no matter how nice that CT loot is?&nbsp; We killed a             ton of a shit last week.&nbsp; Zland, Kland, MotG, CT, Dain. . .all             multiple times.&nbsp; Actually we only got one Dain kill in.&nbsp;             Luckily the other l33t guilds on our server are now *owning* the             Dain.&nbsp; So far he has dropped nothing for them and Dinged up to             level 76 but thank god the Evil Empire that is Legacy of Steel is             not getting the loots!</P>            <P align=left>So, now that I have been an asshole and managed to             piss off a fair percentage of our server, I will continue with this             fine journalism we here at legacyofsteel.net (we being me and my             dog, Jack) call the morning update.&nbsp; As you can see from the             above picture, I recently acquired this toy:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/guiseofthecoercer.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Basically, I was bored.&nbsp; Endless patches and time             in Fear will do that to you.&nbsp; I couldn't stomache another night             on Stormfeather's spawn.&nbsp; So I re-did the Ragebringer quest (in             one day Ccc.) and then took my homeboys to wax this cacksugger:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/stanosdead.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Stanos.&nbsp; Let me see, I will say something and             then have to deal with the know-it-all bastages in the General Forum             but I will say this anyway: Stanos is the most Bad-ass mob you will             fight in the Old World (not counting PoA).&nbsp; Stanos is not             terribly difficult with a full guild raid.&nbsp; Problem is, you             don't schlep an entire guild to go to Highold so you can get a             mask.&nbsp; You ask nicely during some free time and hope people are             willing to help.&nbsp; I think I gathered around 24 or so.&nbsp;             Stanos, even with 24, was a VERY tough fight but it was fun.&nbsp;             We dropped him on our first try.&nbsp; Kind of funny considering             that the next day we went back for more with about the same numbers             and got owned twice before dropping him a second time for             Chon.&nbsp; Minor changes in group composition made the             difference.&nbsp; While fighting Stanos is fun, I must say the best             part about it is getting heckled by the noobs in Highold.&nbsp; So             this is what ya get when you kill Stanos:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/headofstanos.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Honestly, considering the diffuclty of the Quest, I             don't think you'll be seeing too many High Elf Rogues and Bards             running around Norrath any time soon.&nbsp; Bards?&nbsp; Hahaha yes             Bards can wear the mask.&nbsp; Did I mention that the General             despawns after you complete the Quest?&nbsp; Have fun doing the             Ragebringer quest, Bards. . .</P>            <P align=left>Anyway, it was super cool of my guildmates to help out             with this quest.&nbsp; Essentially there was nothing in it for             them.&nbsp; It didn't benefit the guild in anyway.&nbsp; That's just             the type of friends we are I guess.&nbsp; Either that or when I             yelled, "HELP ME WITH THIS FUCKING MASK OR NO MORE PHAT LEWTZ FOR             YOU" had an impact on them.</P>            <P align=left>Like I said, we killed a ton of shit recently.&nbsp;             Late one night last week Kaelem spotted Ragefire up.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/ragefire.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Needless to say he was not up long.&nbsp; Congrats to             <STRONG>Kaelem</STRONG> on his res stick!</P>            <P align=left><STRONG>Metopious</STRONG> is also kicking ass on the             Coldain Ring Quest.&nbsp; He has everything to get Ring 9 now, he             just needs for the Dain not to be poofed *cough cough*.&nbsp; Oh ya,             I was helping with the quest and he hooked me up with this bow:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/adarrasbow.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Holy Jizm, Batman</STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Was very cool of him.&nbsp;

            I am still pissed that it wasn't awarded to Megganystar, my level 1             cleric.&nbsp; I think it was supposed to go to her and Meggan just             ninja'd the thing right out from under me.&nbsp;

Truth is I have been             too fuggin tired to do it the past few nights.&nbsp; The weather             finally turns nice here and my air conditioner breaks.&nbsp; It             blows hot air (kind of like Jangos).&nbsp; Have we been killing             shit?&nbsp; Hell yes, of course we have.&nbsp; After VP on Friday we             proceeded to kill Draco before bed.&nbsp; The next day we spent             questing. . .and oh what a day it was.&nbsp; I'll just leave it at             that rather than suffer the accusations of causing a nerf that's             already in progress.&nbsp; We also have been raking in the Temple of             Veeshan loot recently.&nbsp; We farmed the Halls so hard there are             cows and chickens wandering around there now.&nbsp; We've become so             accustomed to "Leather Nights" in ToV that we were shocked and             overcome with joy when we stumbled in for "Plate Night" this             week.&nbsp; I think since sunday we've gotten 2 Plate bps, 4 plate             legs, and 2 robes from ToV. . .not to mention the Robe of the Azure             Sky we picked up Friday and the two CT Robes tonight.&nbsp; Robes             are good, yes?</P>            <P align=left>Anyway, don't expect an update tomorrow.&nbsp; While             the guild is off unleashing the Wrath of Whoopass on Norrath, I'll             be in downtown L.A. watching the Kings and Colorado.&nbsp; God I             love the playoffs.&nbsp; Maybe if one of my guildmates remembers             that the "-" key is standard on all keyboards, I might just have             something to post for you after I get back from the game             tomorrow.</P>            <P align=left>And no, taking a screenshot of some level 1 rogue             named Tigolestaint, asking for a blowjob doesn't count as a reason             to update the page.</P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/dunkyn.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/jobobo.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/monqq.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/tiggleismydaddy.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/tigolekosla.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/tigolesbadlewtz.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/tigolesbrain.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the             Day</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/dindo_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/genjiro_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_2/jangos_quote.jpg"             border=0></P></font><a name="newsitem988441200,13210,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Where All The White Women At?</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Saturday, April 28, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>      <P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>Phara Dar and Then             Some</FONT></STRONG> </P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april/4_28/pd_dead_4_28.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>We were overdue for a little Veeshan's Peak.&nbsp;             Although this recent trip made me look at the zone in a new             light.&nbsp; With the SoV expansion basically 90% of the loot simply             goes to the bank or our destroy buttons.&nbsp; The zone has some             serious flaws too.&nbsp; I'm not really sure what VI's objective is             with the lightning-quick respawn times.&nbsp; I mean, when we fight             the dragons, we kill the mo fakas solo, or occasionaly we get an add             wurm or racnar.&nbsp; We *know* how to get these mobs solo.&nbsp; So             why not make all the "yard trash" have a long respawn time?&nbsp;             Wouldn't it be more enjoyable for the entire raid to get to kill             every mob leading up to each dragon?&nbsp; Instead people get stuck             waiting on their ass, reading books, watching epic mini-series,             building replicas of the Mayflower in bottles, while the pull team             spends our time getting the dragon to the group solo.&nbsp; Oops, I             just blew some of our l33t strat.&nbsp; For all you "uber" (ya all             just love that term, don't you) people who are going to beg me for             information with your level one characters, I'll save five minutes             of both our time:&nbsp; Don't charge Phara Dar in her lair.&nbsp;             Anyway, all VI has to do to make this an AWESOME zone once again is             upgrade the loot, give the wurms and racnars a realistic respawn             time (something like ToV), and add some loot to the drakes, GW's and             racnars (perhaps the out of date weaps that are dropping on the             dragons now).</P>            <P align=left>Well, enough bitching.&nbsp;
