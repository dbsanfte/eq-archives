I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival.  It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.  It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward, forevermore.<p><dd>You will think me transported with enthusiasm, but I am not.  I am well aware of the toil, and blood, and treasure, that it will cost us to maintain this declaration, and support and defend these States.  Yet, through all the gloom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory.  I can see that the end is more than worth all the means, and that posterity will triumph in that day's transaction, even although we should rue it, which I trust in God we shall not.<p align=right>John Adams to his wife Abigail, 3 July 1776.</p><p><center><hr width=4%>†<hr width=4%></center><p>He might have been off a few days, but John Adams saw both the horrible cost and the great promise ahead for this, his nascent country.<p>Happy 4<sup>th</sup> of July.<p></font></body><a name="newsitem1025722770,38067,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Twenty-Twenty-Twenty Four Hours To Go</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Wednesday, July 3, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork_dropbox@yahoo.com">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>h8</strong></font></center><p>There are lots of things I could rant and rave about right now - the Pledge of Allegiance debacle, CNN french kissing Jack Valenti’s asshole and even fucking Californians banning tag in school for Christ's sake, but right now... Jesus Lord, seriously, fug you guys down in San Diego - I hate Ssra and I hate the Emp.  Requiring 70+ people to camp the keys, at an EXTREMELY generous 2 hours per part, takes 18+ *days* of our time.  I will not even go into the shards - you can take those sticks and shove them up your asses - the only fun part is training the zone after you get your frame and a zone disruption warning really is the cherry on top of that shit sunday.  TEE HEE!!!!!<p>What's even better is that while killing the Emp takes 70+, VT is done with ~40 - and you're surprised so many guilds sacked half their members after getting power sources?  Maybe you guys are blissfully unaware of how painful having 70 reasonably intelligent, funny, witty and engaging people clustered together at once becomes, but after 2 weeks of it non stop with the cross section of EQ, I've become some what of an expert on single digit frame rates and IQ's - oh yah, and drama.  So whatever, we'll kill the Emp and sack VT eventually but <strong>WarCraft III</strong> is out today - big congrats to the LoS Storm Reavers - go support a commitment to quality games (hint to VI: this involves play testing, you cacks) and buy it.<p>Oh you thought I was done?  Not even close, Bud.  To add insult to injury, I was finally forced to get broadband.  I'd resisted the urge for a long time - I mean why?  I have a connection at work most people can only dream about and when I get home there's really not that much sufficiently interesting on the net which requires a high speed connection.  I was HAPPY with my modem, hot dammit, but with SoL all that changed, and I blame - besides 70+ raids - <strong>AE SONGS AND SERVER FILTERS NOT WORKING PROPERLY</strong>.  I guess when you've got no bard testers and 0 bard GM's you're probably not at fault - I mean, testing something as obscure as one of the class defining features is expecting a bit much.  So yay - I can now do Emp without going LD or lagging 3-4 *minutes* in the past.  Leet.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/tig-vt_quote.gif"></center><p>Before I wrap up, I'd like to pay tribute to one of the more influential people in my life who pasted away Friday, June 28, 2002 - <strong>Henry "The Bull" Del Toro</strong>.  As telling and fugged up as it may be, The Bull wasn't a scientist, humanitarian or astronaut, nothing like that in fact - he was a morning radio shock jock before the name was coined and the genre trite - and someone who had the unprecedented access to both my ears and my attention in my formative years.  Brief snippets on the way to school or those dog days, like Scout's smartly starched collars damp by 9, of summer break listening all morning outside under the muggy umbra of a threatening humidity before the real heat set in, it didn't matter - I was held rapt.  The sheer infectious nature of his laugh would make any stunt or bit funny and his heart was always in the right place - he loved what he did and was keenly aware of his impact, though modesty prevailed in his later interviews regarding such, but his real talent was recognizing and reveling in the uncomfortable and awkward moments of life, stretching them beyond what would be the polite decorum of escape, always eschewing tact and even, at times, humane mercy for those found caught and cornered to experience such in the fullest - that propensity to hold unflinching and bear witness to one of the great human event horizons is the most memorable and meaningful bit I thankfully have taken away from it all.  R.I.P. Bull.<p>In between coffins, drama and my bitching, we killed a bunch of stuff, so have a gander.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/creator-fight.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/arlos_quote.gif"><p><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/creator-dead.jpg"><p><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/sont.jpg"><br>Speculum, pls.</center><p>God knows the fun killing Cursed is, yes?

I've been really proud of the way the guild perseveres through what have been some long and at times humbling loses while we're in the midst of transition and the attendant learning curve.  Blame it all on Trak, but despite killing that bitch non-stop for months in RoK, we got the shaft and shitloads of SK BPs that still molder in the bank.  LoS never had a Donal's Army - we had *1* BP in fact - and thus all the successes of the past are all the more impressive when you consider it was due to simply amazing clerics, not counting to 5 and mashing a hotkey.  I suppose we could warm up on CH rotation with AoW, but we're not much on going 11 months in reverse.

On general principles alone (well, okay - and greed), if it spawned in Ssra, we were all over it like a gnat on a dog's dick.

With the cries of 'burn him down!' and 'MOTHERFUCKER!', we somehow pulled out a win, and then started to handle the mess - minus the people who stood around clicking on the corpse (on a personal note, IF YOU TYPE SLOW OR READ ON THE THIRD GRADE LEVEL GET OFF THE CORPSE.
