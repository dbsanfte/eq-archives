            <P></P>
            <P align=left>Ah the Holidays. . .All I can say is get me a bottle 
            of something strong, lock the front door tight and pray for 
            Tuesday.&nbsp; In case you can't tell I've been finishing my Holiday 
            shopping.&nbsp; Didn't someone say this is supposed to be the season 
            of joy?&nbsp; Obviously whatever fool came up with that cockeyed 
            notion never made it to the mall in December.</P>
            <P align=left>So Veeshan's Peak was on the schedule.&nbsp; We start 
            gathering on the roof, getting ready for some dragon 
            whoop-ass.&nbsp; Slowly it becomes clear that we're not going to 
            have enough people to make an effective run.&nbsp; Too many people 
            gone for the holidays.&nbsp; To&nbsp;combat some of the boredom and 
            dissapointment of a cancelled VP trip, we decided to whack that fool 
            dragon, Talendor, just because. . .</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt=""

            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>To give you an idea how low our numbers were, we only 
            had four people survive the fight.&nbsp; And two of them were 
            bards.&nbsp; (No, of course Tork didn't live -- who are you 
            kidding?).&nbsp; This is the part of the update where we all ooooooh 
            and aaaaaah at the loot.&nbsp; Only I sort of fugged up.&nbsp; I 
            died so I went to get some Chinese food while waiting on my 
            res.&nbsp; I'm sure we got something.&nbsp; And I'm sure it went to 
            someone very deserving. . .but that's about the most I can do for 
            ya.</P>
            <P align=left>Well, before Veeshan's Peak I went with some people to 
            Dragon Necropolis.&nbsp; We were having a good time.&nbsp; Mostly we 
            were just trying to get some exp and the occasional decent 
            drop.&nbsp; We weren't after anything in particular, just fun.&nbsp; 
            Nizzarr picks up a named mob on track.&nbsp; So we head towards 
            it.&nbsp; Turns out the mob is holding what looks like a 
            Knuckleduster.&nbsp; Everyone immediately starts thinking 
            Willsapper.&nbsp; We decide to pull the rat, even though he conned 
            red to a 60, and see if we could keeeel he.&nbsp; He was a 
            poosae.&nbsp; Galiaan, a ranger mind you, was tanking.&nbsp; The mob 
            procs slow -- Willsapper!&nbsp; The mob is piercing -- 
            Willsapper!&nbsp; The mob is at a sliver.&nbsp; Boom, he 
            gates.&nbsp; Next thing we know we are getting raped prison-style by 
            every rat in the dungeon.&nbsp; Anyone who has fought and been 
            whiped out in Necropolis knows what a project CR can be.&nbsp; CR 
            takes up right until our Veeshan's Peak trip.&nbsp; Big rush to get 
            there only to have it cancelled.</P>
            <P align=left>After Talendor, I asked around to see who wanted to go 
            back and try to get to the rat-bastard rat.&nbsp; This time we take 
            two groups.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we had an accidental pull of the 
            mob with the Willsapper, got him way too early as we were 
            unprepared.&nbsp; We whoop him but once again get bent over by his 
            rodent buddies.&nbsp; I get ressed in-fight and hide.&nbsp; Polo 
            checks the loot and it's a Willsapper.&nbsp; All I can say is my 
            guildmates kick-ass.&nbsp; They went through hours of CR so I can 
            now proudly call this bad-boy my new weap:</P>

            <P align=left>Two groups took a major sacrifice for me and I wont 
            forget that.&nbsp; I like to think that's the reason behind our 
            success as a guild: Loyalty to one another and a spirit that never 
            quits.&nbsp; Well, that and tons of HGS.</P>
            <P align=left>Another highlight of the Necropolis trip was our 
            encounter with Jaled Dar's Shade:</P>
