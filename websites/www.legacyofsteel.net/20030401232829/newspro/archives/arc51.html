A *very* unique encounter compared to most of the other             SoV and RoK stuff we're accustomed to.&nbsp; So earlier today I             posted on our Forums that we were going to have to start keeeling             Sontalak because the other guilds on the The Nameless have finally             discovered the Klandicar is the single biggest poosae on the face of             Norrath.&nbsp; We start putting together a strat thread and people             start posting all the l33t sploits they've heard about in IRC and on             other message boards.&nbsp; But rather than try any of those             methods, we just decided to see how we did in a straight-up,             toe-to-toe with Sontacack.&nbsp; Needless to say, 35 members of LoS             &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sontalak.</P>            <P align=left>Yesterday I posted what Doze's loot window looked             like.&nbsp; Sontalak's is a bleak comparison:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_5/sontalakloots.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Those arms are just some shitty AC 16, twink             crap.&nbsp;

With 33 people we took down that big lump of shit we all             know and love, that's right, Cazic Tool:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_5/ctdead.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>CT dropped a Halo and a Cloak.&nbsp;

But             for the guild it was business as usual. Was a fun night.&nbsp; First             stop was Icewell Keep to lay waste to <STRONG>Dain Cacksugger the             IV</STRONG>.&nbsp; He was the 425 Dorf tonight, again.&nbsp; The             fuggin noobs that plague Icewell are really getting old             though.&nbsp; We had two gimps trying to loot the Dain             tonight.&nbsp; Times like that I wish The Nameless was PvP.</P>            <P align=left>So as you can tell from the above picture, we also             ripped into Doz-e-queer the Cursed.&nbsp; I posted that pic so you             could spend hours analyzing our strats, only to flame us on our             boards. Actually the picture is faked.&nbsp; What we usually like to             do with Dozekar is train him to Lendinara the Keeper then make them             fight it out only to KS Lendinara at the last possible second!&nbsp;             We read it at the Safehouse so it we knew it MUST be true.&nbsp;             Well, strat aside, the important thing is ph4t l3tz right?&nbsp; Now             THIS is what you wanna see when you right-click on Ol' Dozey's             corpse:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/7tears.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Count 'em folks</STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Now to leave you all hanging. . .</P>            <P align=left>We DID complete some new quests tonight but I don't             have any pictures for you yet.&nbsp; <STRONG>Moca</STRONG> completed             the Test of the Long Battle Tonight.&nbsp; Resulted in some boots --             AC 25 +10 Wis Sta +50 Mana +3 all saves Effect: Aura of Battle --             Wis caster only.</P>            <P align=left>Also, next time I update this page I'll post the             results of the FOUR tear quest too -- the Request of the             Strong.&nbsp; Leick's currently got all the tears for it sitting in             his inventory, logged out in ToV.&nbsp; Of course the goal is to             complete all of these ToV quests but with Doze on a one week spawn             (not to mention the&nbsp;named drakes) it's gonna take us some             time.</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalker's, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/arlosea.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/lieck.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/tigolestoilet.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/tigzbung.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the             Day</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/adorean.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/barn_quote.jpg"             border=0></P></font><a name="newsitem991033200,18145,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Wasting Away In Margaritaville</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Monday, May 28, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>   <P align=center><FONT size=4><STRONG>The Swarthiest of             Sl00ts</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_27/jangos.jpg"             width=500 border=0></P>            <P align=center>"Jangos" -- Art by <STRONG>Thatia</STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Hail Lovers, Freaks, Sl00ts, Wanna-be's, EQ junkies,             Foolmans, Friends and Lovers of HLS!</P>            <P align=left>Well, I am still on vacation but this fuggin web site             was in dire need of an update.&nbsp; Unfortunately for all of you, I             have no graphics programs on this shit-ass laptop so that picture             will probably take you a good ten minutes to download unless you're             sitting at NASA or some shit.&nbsp; Frankly, I could give a rat's             ass how long it takes you -- just be patient it's worth the             wait.&nbsp; Thatia once again proves that not only is she the Queen             of HLS, she is also an amazingly talented artist.</P>            <P align=left>So it's overcast as a mo faka today.&nbsp; I've been             baking in the sun for so many days in a row now that it's nice to be             chilling inside for once.&nbsp; Hell, it's 11:30 in the morning, I'm             drinking Corona's and watching the Lakers own the Spurs             (again).&nbsp; How bad can life really be?</P>            <P align=left>Oh wait, I forgot, no one actually gives a shit what I             am doing since I am not out raping and pillaging with the asskicking             machine known as Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; I spoke with Rhap on the             phone the other night and he filled me in on what the guild has been             up to.&nbsp; It seems that since I've been out of town Dozekar,             Tormax, Zland, Kland, CT and numerous other deserving-to-die beasts             have been catapulted to their deaths.&nbsp; Actually, there is even             new loot to report.&nbsp; Tormax dropped some KICK ASS gloves --             28ac +6 dex/str/sta +75 HP. . .Of course, Rhap being a lazy drunken             son of a sl00t cacksugger didn't bother posting a screenshot of them             or emailing one to me, so you'll just have to take my word for             it.</P>            <P align=left>So I know Doze had died a few times since I've been             gone but I have no clue what he dropped or if any new quests have             been completed.&nbsp; I do know that he did drop one more of the             tears toward the four tear quest Leick is working on.&nbsp; We're             all pretty excited to see just what four tears from old Doze-slacker             aka Doz-e-queer the Cursed can buy.&nbsp; Oooooh, and speaking of             Leick, many congrats to my homeboy on getting his Dain Ring.</P>            <P align=left>Enough rambling for me.&nbsp; There are beers to be             drank.&nbsp; If these clouds clear up I've got to deal with the             monumental task of moving my lazy ass 100 yards to the beach.&nbsp;             I'll be back in business next weekend at which time you can prepare             yourself for the ONSLAUGHT of dead mobs this page will be littered             with.&nbsp; In the meantime, the mobs will have to keep on dying             with no press coverage.&nbsp; I think you'll survive.</P>            <P align=left>Signing off from the land of the Chi Chi,</P>            <P align=left>--Tigole     Bitties</P></font>
