My nipples get             hard just thinking about all that snow.&nbsp; Well, nonetheless, I             decided to buy the expansion anyway.&nbsp; In fact it's sitting here             on my desk.&nbsp; Waiting to be opened. . . .waiting to be             installed. . .I even drove to the GHETTO to buy it.&nbsp; Man,             Ghetto Mall was the only place that had it in stock.&nbsp; I get             there and I cannot find the store.&nbsp; I pass this one spot that             used to be a Mexican Restaruant.&nbsp; This will tell you just how             ghetto this mall is.&nbsp; The Mexican Restaraunt closes down and a             Jewelry store moves in.&nbsp; But the jewelry store doesn't renovate             the space at all.&nbsp; It's called DON ROBERTO'S JEWELERS now. .             .fucking, gold necklaces displayed in spanish-style windows, you             know, white stucco, subtle arches.&nbsp; Anyway, thanks to Ghetto             Mall, I now have my copy of Scars of Velious.&nbsp; I also remember             why I do all my shopping online.&nbsp; Shit, that reminds me I need             to cancel my Amazon pre-order.&nbsp;

Usually, we don't give out our strategies (sorry all             my level 1 friends) but just this once I will share some of my             uber-l33tness with you.&nbsp; Buffs are key.&nbsp; First I buff with             Jboots.&nbsp; Next comes Ultravision.&nbsp; Then Strength of Earth             combined with my +7 attack buff from my Shrunken Goblin             Earring.&nbsp; At this point I am a virtual killing machine.&nbsp;             There is no stopping me.&nbsp; I prefer to stand in the corner and             with any luck, get a nice clean solo pull of the Chancellor.&nbsp;             Next I press the "A" button.&nbsp;
