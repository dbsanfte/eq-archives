The amount of time we dedicated to get our keys to see this guy die and take a turn at the Emperor is just sick.&nbsp; To finally see Blood die only to have the ENTIRE raid DT'd from anywhere in the room was simply an insult.&nbsp; Blood dies, there are two earrings on the corpse, yet no matter where you are in the room, the Emperor DT's.&nbsp; So congrats rot on those.&nbsp; It's cheap enough to make a mob DT in the first place.&nbsp; But to have his agro radius extend to the entire room is ridiculous.&nbsp; So let me get this straight -- and this is how you guys envisioned this in San Diego:&nbsp; You spend months farming keys to get up to the room.&nbsp; Months farming Shissar Bane weapons (and the recipe is where?).&nbsp; You kill Blood while dealing with 8 other snakes in the room.&nbsp; And immediately after that fight you're supposed to engage the DEATHTOUCHING-FROM-ANYWHERE-IN-THE-ROOM Emperor along with the 8 snakes?&nbsp; Whoever came up with this sheer *fisting* of an encounter can go fuck themselves.&nbsp; Do me a favor so I don't waste my guild's time on this kind of jackass shit-fest again, send me an email at <A href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole@legacyofsteel.net</A> when you decide to A) Implement an encounter that wasn't designed by a retarded chimp chained to a cubicle B) Get a Quality Assuarance Department C) Actually beta test the fucking thing and D) Patch it live.&nbsp; And please for god's sake -- do it in the order I laid out for you.&nbsp; Don't worry, I won't charge you a consulting fee on that one.&nbsp; And for good luck you might as well E) Pull your heads out of your asses.&nbsp; While you're at it rename the game to BetaQuest since you've used up you're alotted false advertising karma on the Bazaar and user interface scam of '01.</P><P align=left>Fix the Emperor encounter.&nbsp; Fix Seru.&nbsp; Rethink your time-sink bullshit.&nbsp; Fix all the buggy motherfucking ring encounters (I suggest you let whoever made the Burrower one do this since that dude apparently laid off the crack the rest of you were smoking).&nbsp; Fix the VT key quest.&nbsp; Fix VT (just guessing it's fucked up considering your track record).&nbsp; Don't have the resources to fix this stuff?&nbsp; Move the ENTIRE Planes of Power team over to&nbsp;fixing&nbsp;Shadows of Luclin&nbsp;AND DO IT NOW.&nbsp; If you don't fix Luclin, you jackassess will be the only ones playing the Planes of Power.</P></body></html><a name="newsitem1018594800,78441,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Don't Know What I Want But I Know How To Get It</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Friday, April 12, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><html><head>	<title>Untitled</title></head><body><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>          How Do You Own the          High Priest?</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/hp_owned.jpg" border=0></FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG>One Part Malone, One Part Capone and Two Parts Stallone.&nbsp;

We were goddamned sick and tired of seeing him up on track.&nbsp; Although we have killed the High Priest before, we were having some trouble dealing with the new, insane respawn High Priest.&nbsp; But tonight we came up with the new plan.&nbsp; Off to the Batphone I went and the Commisioner quickly rounded up all the help we'd ever need to kill the High Priest:&nbsp;Karl Malone, Al Capone, Sly Stallone and of course, the true hero of the evening, Frank Stallone.&nbsp; Before we knew it there was nothing but a corpse left of the cacksugging snake that had been plaguing us.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/hp_dead_tig.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>In all seriousness though, I want to give major props to everyone for the absolutely kick ass night of raiding.&nbsp; The planning and execution of the kill was near perfect.&nbsp; I want to give a special thanks to Adorean Lew, human wizard and master of arcane teleportation (a.k.a. port bitch).&nbsp; While our strategies are a collective effort from everyone in the guild, Adorean really helped me keep this raid moving.&nbsp; But everyone there deserves credit for performing so well.&nbsp; We zoned in, cleared our way up and killed the HP, simple as that.&nbsp; Oh, and I guess I should note that we came straight from Kael too.&nbsp; Of course our buddy the AoW had to die.&nbsp; No matter how many times I fight that mob it's still a rush.&nbsp; Of course his loot makes it rather nice to watch him die often as well ;)</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/aow_down.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Ok, this update is already a mess of wishy-washy bullshit.&nbsp; I can't pass the Bar everyday -- yeah, even I run low on material.&nbsp; Every once and a while you just have to stop and appreciate the phat kills.&nbsp; Arch Lich, Burrower, AoW, Shei, and High Priest. . .all on first attempts -- not such a bad post-patch hit list ;)&nbsp; Did I mention how great these mo fakas in my guild are?&nbsp; Now give me some goddamn recipes and I'll post you some new corpses to look at.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/arizonabarexam_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/azguy_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/iwurshiptigole_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/mikricci_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/obgynofsorn_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/owennolan_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/statebar_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/theaavatarofwar_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/thebatfon_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/theoldexoftig_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/tigolesbitties_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/tigspunycack_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_12/ziggypaly_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=center><A href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif" border=0></A></P><DIV align=center></DIV></body></html><a name="newsitem1018508630,29397,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>I Look At Your Pants And I Need a Kiss</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, April 11, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><html><head>	<title>Untitled</title></head><body><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>          Double Header</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/burower_parv.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;</FONT><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/shei_dead.jpg" border=0></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><EM>The Burrower stares in awe at *The Pants* while the Shei simply keeled over at the very sight. . .</EM></STRONG></P><P align=left> Parv Vardt, Halfling Hero, was the first to discover the coveted Proudfoot Greaves quest, sending a ripple of controversy and dismay throughout the Everquest Community.&nbsp; Ever since unveiling "The Pants", Parv has been overwhelmed with accusations of "insider info" and other shadey behavior.&nbsp; After all, how could Parv have acquired the godly Jesus-like item of the trousers-community such as "The Pants" well before anyone else was even close to having so much of a clue as to their existence.&nbsp; Well, suck it up lovers, we've got Parv and Parv has "The Pants" so you are all forced to live in your second-class existence of pantslessness.&nbsp; The quest for "The Pants" is so painstaking and grueling, so time consuming, so incredibly difficult and requires so much skill, we estimate you wont see another Halfling warlord wearing these pants for at least 9 years.&nbsp; Cry nerf if you will, but until we see that &lt;SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE&gt; you can bet your sweet ass we'll be sploiting the power of "The Pants" as hard as it can be sploited.</P><P align=left>First came the Burrower Cacksugger.&nbsp; Our first tank up on the Burrower was Bzul who seemed to instantly go Linkdead.&nbsp; Normally, as I've instructed my guild, when someone goes Linkdead we all /q, succor, evac, gate, train the zone or Ebay our characters.&nbsp; However, inspired by the shining golden brilliance of "The Pants" Parv jumped in and one-tanked the Burrower to it's death.&nbsp; As the luck of "The Pants" would have it, the loot was pretty fuggin phat:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/burrower_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Now that's what we like to see here on The Nameless.&nbsp; Well, that and boobies.&nbsp; After the Burrower died, we went to Ahkeva to work on our Vex Thal faction because we are so damned close to completing our keys all we need is faction.&nbsp; And for the zone to exist.&nbsp; And for the zone to have mobs.&nbsp; And for the zone to have loot.&nbsp; And for there to be&nbsp;a key.&nbsp; And for there to be a key quest.&nbsp; But besides that and our faction, we're ALMOST ready to zone in.&nbsp; By the way, if any of you hurmorless jackasses goes and posts a moronic VT thread in my forums I'm not only going to ban you.&nbsp; So anyway, as we were hard at work on our VT keys, we decided to kill Shei Mallown.&nbsp; The Shei is what we call, in strictly technical terms, a tremendous pillowbiting poooosae.&nbsp; The fight was all fine and dandy until we hit a small "Dumbass Speedbump" and lost like 3 people to enrage. . .Anyone who knows how the Shei works, knows that when someone dies to him, a mob spawns.&nbsp; So you can imagine what it's like when the Jackass Factor&nbsp;gets the best of us, and people forget&nbsp;to press A when those big red letters E-N-R-A-G-E-D show up on the screen.&nbsp; Our biggest fear was that Abru, our lone LoS druid, would be killed. . .:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/jmann_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>In another news I would like to take a moment to talk about my personal life.&nbsp; Today was a very special day for me.&nbsp; In the mail this afternoon, I recieved notice that I had passed the State Bar of Arizona.&nbsp; Along with a very official letter from the State I was happy to get my State Bar of Arizona Identification card, with my name printed on it and my official Bar number.&nbsp; I would like to thank everyone who supported me all those years, the folks who had faith in me and helped me achieve this moment of greatness.&nbsp; Perhaps the thing that makes this truly special (besides the fact that my life as I know it will from this day forth be changed, forever devoted to the Law of the blessed state of Arizona) is the fact that I never took the bar.&nbsp; Nor have I ever lived in Arizona.&nbsp; But I would like to thank the State Bar of Arizona for this fantastic vote of confidence in my legal skills.&nbsp; I eagerly await my first trial and if any of you, my friends, should ever need legal representation in the courts of Arizona, rest assured that I, Tigole Bitties, have been deemed a worthy advisor for all your legal woes.&nbsp; God bless the court systems and god bless our Government.&nbsp; And no, I shit you not, this is 100 percent true -- somehow the jackasses of the State Bar of Arizona passed me, despite the fact I never took a test, don't live in Arizona, never applied and simply was fortunate enough to have the same name as some dumbass searching the back of his mailbox right now wondering if he passed or not.&nbsp; Life is grand sometimes.&nbsp; Maybe I'll move to Tuscon and try to legalize marijauna.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG>    </P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/hairyteabag_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/sisterofssorn_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/thenamelessfilter_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/tigsazzbuddy_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/tijuanadonkygal_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/unoriginalbastard_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the Day</FONT></STRONG>   </P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/gullem_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>&nbsp;</P><P align=center><A href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif" border=0></A></P><DIV align=center></DIV></body></html>
