"You can piss down my back but don't tell me it's raining."</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left>I won't dwell on Legends for too long today.&nbsp; Yes, I could sit here and write a novel on why Legends is a bad thing for the majority of Everquest.&nbsp; But I simply don't have time.&nbsp; I just didn't want the opening of the new Legends server to pass by without being able to say a quick and heart-felt, Fuck You In the Goatass, to all involved with it.&nbsp; I've heard all the arguments before about getting what you pay for and "don't go to McDonald's and expect Filet Mignon" and other such brilliant and well thought out defenses.&nbsp; I haven't seen such legal spindoctoring since Johnny Cochran helped my beloved Juice (go Trojans!)&nbsp;murder two people and walk away scott-free.&nbsp; But let's face the facts, all of the features that were promised to us with the release of SoL are still not here.&nbsp; Seems to me Legends is a pretty new service.&nbsp; Doesn't it surprise anyone how fast the "new" Cazic Thule was revamped for the server?&nbsp; Could it possibly be the jackass whose job it was to make the Bazaar work like it was ADVERTISED was instead buffing up Lizards in CT for Daddy Warbucks on Stormhammer?&nbsp; Where's my new interface?&nbsp; Where's my new visible armor?&nbsp; Like it or not folks the people on our Poor Folk Ghetto Servers spent money on PROMISED features which as of today do not exist.&nbsp; You guys still going to run and defend the Legends losers with the old, "You get what you pay for" jibberish?&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; We didn't get what we paid for.&nbsp; I went to McDonald's expecting a goddamn Big Mac, not Filet Mignon, and you know what I got instead?&nbsp; A Shit Sandwich.</P><P align=left>Now that I got that off my chest, let's talk about "stuff dying" because after all, this is an Everquest website and it's my job to post a bunch of big dead things and talk about just how cool we are.&nbsp; So here comes that line of nonsense:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_27/al_dead.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_27/creator_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>So, um, we killed some snakes.&nbsp; They were incredibly difficult to kill.&nbsp; The Creator required our whopping force of 32 people to kill.&nbsp; The victory was flawless, not a single death.&nbsp; I Sseem to remember Ssomeone&nbsp;Ssaying that the Creator was more&nbsp;difficult than the AoW.&nbsp; Excuse me while I try to stop laughing.&nbsp; So anyway, we had the opposite of the Night of Suck&nbsp;on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were unstoppable.&nbsp; Because of the late patch we had very low&nbsp;numbers but we&nbsp;just kept killing&nbsp;with&nbsp;almost all flawless victories.&nbsp; As far as loot goes, well, we were prison raped in that&nbsp;department.&nbsp; Check out our Creator loot:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_27/bladeofangles_loot.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;

If anything in high end EQ needs to be ranted about right now it's the ratio of WEAPONS vs. ARMOR dropping on uber mobs.&nbsp; For most classes, if you think about your "best of slot" item in the *known* game at this point, it probably drops in North ToV still.&nbsp; I don't know about you guys, but I'd rather see some nice bracers or rings dropping than 2 billion rotting piece of shit weapons off every mob we kill.&nbsp; Perhaps this garbage loot is just sitting there waiting for the eventual and inevitable gimp-i-fication of these mobs which is surely just around the corner.&nbsp; But for guilds who killed Vulak since last summer, who have been killing Tunare and the AoW, well, all these goddamn weapons are getting really old.&nbsp; To put it in perspective in Ssrae&nbsp;-- SK and Pally have weapons that drop off of the Basement mobs, the Arch Lich and the Creator -- all of which rot every single time they drop for us.</P><P align=left>Here's an example of decent loot that doesn't rot off of a Ssrae Mob:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_27/sleeves_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center>More like this please</P><P align=left>Speaking of the basement mobs, I guess rotting loot is better than what drops off the Runed.&nbsp;

I had to camp through about 30 walls before I could finally sploit my way up to the big mo faka snake that's waiting patiently to be killed.&nbsp; Unfortunately or maybe fortunately (only time will tell) getting keys is a pain in the ass.&nbsp; So unless this bitch can be dropped by me and 3 others, well, he ain't dying on The Nameless soon.&nbsp; I shouldn't speak to fast.&nbsp; I think I might have found a nice pathing sploit in that lava.&nbsp;

I guess this would all be fine and dandy if we had a web d00d who knew just what the fuck he is doing.&nbsp; But instead you get me.&nbsp; Because I left so many images on the front page, and up to a week of updates using lousy compression, we were moving 6 GIGS per **DAY** of traffic.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; Well, luckily we have some web pimps around here who gave me a swift kick in the nuts and got things straightened out.&nbsp; Barnabuss, infamous Dorf of Britannica, has come up with a new News Archiving system.&nbsp; Eventually all the old updates will be convereted to this.&nbsp; Barn also is responsible for the awesome Gallery section.&nbsp; Anyway, that's your warning for the night -- if suddenly los.net doesn't exist tomorrow -- just sit tight and chill until we find a host who can handle our traffic.</P><P align=left>So getting on to what's been dying. . .well mostly us.&nbsp;
