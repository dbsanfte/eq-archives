            <P></P>
            <P align=left><STRONG>Chardok</STRONG>: The Sarnak Fortress nestled 
            in the Northeast corner of <STRONG>Burning Woods</STRONG> was the 
            setting of yesterday's adventure.&nbsp; Challeging mobs. . 
            .beautiful architecture and design. . .moody ambiance. . .loot on a 
            par with <STRONG>Befallen</STRONG>.&nbsp; Actually, Befallen 
            probably has some&nbsp;nicer drops.&nbsp; Our main objective was a 
            raid on the <STRONG>Royal Palace</STRONG> burried deep within the 
            dungeon.&nbsp; First stop was the <STRONG>Prince's</STRONG> 
            chamber.&nbsp; We made sure to give Prince some Purple Pain and then 
            let <STRONG>Gandalfina</STRONG> loot his head to use toward her 
            Staff Quest.</P>
            <P align=center><STRONG><EM>The Sarnak Foremerly Known As. . . 
            .</EM></STRONG></P>

            <P align=left>Down past the library into the King's chamber.&nbsp; 
            The <STRONG>King</STRONG> likes to hang out with 7 or 8 buddies at a 
            time.&nbsp; Luckily, our motto is the more the merrier.&nbsp; The 
            more sarnaks there are, the more fierce smack-down we get to 
            lay.&nbsp; The King was so much fun to kill, we stuck around and did 
            it again later on.&nbsp; Both <STRONG>Amulek</STRONG> and 
            <STRONG>Demius</STRONG> were able to loot the note that he drops to 
            continue their questing.&nbsp; So here is my Halfling's-eye-view of 
            the King getting pulverized.</P>
            <P align=center><STRONG><EM>The King is Dead But He's Not Forgotten. 
            . .Well, Yes He Is</EM></STRONG></P>

            <P align=left>Lastly, the <STRONG>Queen</STRONG>.&nbsp; The Queen 
            ranks up there as one of the tougher mobs.&nbsp; Her Area of Effect 
            spell can shred through raiding parties very quickly.&nbsp; Add to 
            that her 7 guards and you have yourself a good fight.&nbsp; Our main 
            hope was that the Queen would drop the blade required for the 
            Warrior Epic Quest.&nbsp; Instead she dropped a bunch of junk not 
            worthy to sell in the <STRONG>East Commons</STRONG> tunnel.&nbsp; At 
            least the fighting was fun.&nbsp; That in itself was a nice 
            reward.</P>
            <P align=center><STRONG><EM>God Save the Queen. . .well, actually, 
            Let the Bitch Rot</EM></STRONG></P>

            <P></P>
            <P></P>
            <P>I arrived at <STRONG>Old Sebilis</STRONG> to see my old friend, 
            <STRONG>Polonious</STRONG>, with a new weapon in hand.&nbsp; I was 
            shocked, amazed and delighted when I found out the news -- he had 
            completed the Epic Quest for the <STRONG>Singing Short 
            Sword</STRONG>.</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt="Dance of the Blade"

            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>We figured what better way to celebrate Polonious's 
            great accomplishment than to drive that sword right into that 
            overgrown leeezard we've all come to know and hate as 
            <STRONG>Trakanon</STRONG>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I only have this 
            rogue's-eye-veiw of the dragon because literally within the first 
            stab of my blade, Trak sent me packing for Shroomy land.</P>

            <P align=left>Once the beast was dead on the dungeon floor, we 
            discovered our rewards.&nbsp; <STRONG>Monq Corps</STRONG> now dons a 
            <STRONG>Poison Mantle</STRONG> and everyone's favorite Halfling 
            Druid, <STRONG>Ezeekiel Moebius</STRONG>, was given an <STRONG>Elder 
            Spiritualist's Breastplate</STRONG>.</P>

            <P align=left>We heard rumors of something evil lurking in 
            <STRONG>Emerald Jungle</STRONG>.&nbsp; Hell, we didn't even care if

            <P align=left>Many would think that this journey would be nearing an 
            end but things were only just starting to get psychedllic.&nbsp; In 
            order to help <STRONG>Monq</STRONG> and <STRONG>Suggly</STRONG> with 
            their epic quests, we dove into the depths of the <STRONG>Lavastorm 
            Volcano</STRONG> to fight the slippery <STRONG>Eejag</STRONG>.</P>

            <P align=left>Congrats to Monq and Suggly who are now one step 
            closer to new mittens.</P>
            <P align=left>Well, we thought we were done for the night.&nbsp; We 
            began to go our seperate ways when the call came.&nbsp; 
            <STRONG>Crimson Tempest</STRONG> was in the <STRONG>Plane of 
            Hate</STRONG> and they wished to kill <STRONG>Maestro</STRONG> and 
            <STRONG>Innoruuk</STRONG>.&nbsp; Would LoS come and help?&nbsp; LoS 
            help to kill gods and dragons?&nbsp; Don't have to ask twice.&nbsp; 
            We hastily threw together two groups to join forces with the gang 
            already in Hate.&nbsp; Inny went down quicker than a pair of panties 
            on prom night.&nbsp; Unfortunately, yours truly was the first to 
            die. . .while sitting in Firona Vie awaiting a res, some gnome 
            slipped me a mickey and well. . . .I got shitfaced.&nbsp; I was so 
            drunk, not only could I not loot my corpse, I could not&nbsp;SEE my 
            corpse.&nbsp; I could however see the dead <STRONG>God of 
            Hate</STRONG>, Innoruuk. . .and what a beautiful sight it was.</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt="Inny Dead" 
            src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november/11_7/inny_drunk.jpg" 
            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>Crimson Tempest was nice enough to let 
            <STRONG>Necrath</STRONG> loot Innoruuk's coveted book since none of 
            their folks in Hate needed the item.&nbsp; Many congrats to Necrath 
            on the well-deserved, most godly item.</P>
            <P align=left>Then came <STRONG>Maestro</STRONG>. . .sigh.&nbsp; The 
            mo faka (tm Llod Llod) was duel wielding.&nbsp; Our numbers in Hate 
            were more than sufficient but we lacked certain classes.&nbsp; For 
            example, there was no one who could land slow.&nbsp; To make a long 
            story short, he FoWned us.&nbsp; Hard.&nbsp; Twice.&nbsp; Many 
            wanted to log.&nbsp; Many did.&nbsp; Never ones to quit though, we 
            managed to rally support to try one final attempt.&nbsp; Finally, 
            with one last spirited effort we took the Superman Vampire down once 
            and for all.</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt="Maestro going down"
