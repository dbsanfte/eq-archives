Apparently, by entering the zone called Temple of Veeshan your guild roster is likely to DOUBLE in size.&nbsp; Be warned, scheduling a raid in this zone can even seem to activate accounts that have sat dormant for weeks.&nbsp; No need to worry, Verant has a team of programmers working on the problem which at this point is only being referred to by the Latin name:&nbsp; Lootius&nbsp;Whoreius.<HR><P></P><P align=left><STRONG>And now on with the news. . .</STRONG>(yes considering what CNN calls news these days, even a slackdaddy like me can post a bunch of bullshit and get away with calling it *news* I guess)</P><P align=left>We cleared ToV last night.&nbsp;

I tell everyone to gather around the dragons but to not block them.&nbsp; After a few futile attempts of trying to explain the concept of *not blocking* the dragons, I ended up with this fine picture:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_24/dragonsblocked.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Yvang summed it up best:</P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_24/yvang_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Hrm, lemme see. . .what else have we killed recently. . .oh, yeah, this dude again:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_24/iv_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>That's all for today.&nbsp;

Manalope ebayed his account.&nbsp; For complete details please check <A href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/16/technology/column_gaming/"><STRONG>this link</STRONG></A>.&nbsp; Of course we were horrified to learn that the Manalope we know and love is no more, that in fact we have been playing EQ with some Daddy Warbucks this whole time.&nbsp; CNN, the news source that of course can never be wrong, also confirmed that Manalope was responsible for the infamous "Cargelia Training Incedent" -- Cargelia, as CNN puts it, is that dragon in Western Wastes that never has SoW and never roams near SG.&nbsp; While CNN was hard at work ensuring their journalistic integrity, they also came across undeniable facts that link Manalope to the Al Queda terrorist network.&nbsp; It seems Manalope (or Osmanalope as his followers call him) came up with an elaborate money laundering program using Everquest and Ebay to fund terrorist operations on a world-wide scale.&nbsp; In a slightly related story CNN also announced that the Beatles in fact had FIVE (not the previously rumored 4) members -- John, Paul, George, Ringo and Manalope.&nbsp; We here at Legacy of Steel would like to thank CNN for proving just how much intergrity&nbsp;exists in the world of journalism these days.&nbsp; Without your hard work, CNN, we actually might have to all start thinking for ourselves someday.</P><P align=left>In other news, our new web site decided that it wanted to be like the old web site and took a nice hefty break from the online world this week.&nbsp; Well, I guess I have alot to update you on although I can't remember what was killed when, I just have some pictures and what not to keep you all happy while you get paid for reading a website at work which would cause your boss to fire your ass in 3 seconds if he knew you were reading it on his dime.</P><P align=left>We decided to kill this dude again, even if the beloved gimp pull to the zone no longer works.&nbsp; Where there's a will, there's a way:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/iv_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><STRONG><EM>A Troll, Two Swarthy Sloots and a dead IV. . . .</EM></STRONG></P><P align=left>Earlier in the week we spent some time killing snakes.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/exiled.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Here's the stats on that sword:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/blasphemousblade.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Currently my the sword resides in my fletching kit along with a Reaver from the Statue of RZ and a Blade of Carnage from the AoW, all eagerly awaiting my next trip to Thurgadin where they will meet their final destination:&nbsp; Tha Hands of Mort.</P><P align=left>We also did the AC Ring last night which in case you did not know is officially called, <STRONG>The Ring of Torture</STRONG>.&nbsp; Other acceptable names include The Ring of Boredom or the Ring of Suck-Ass.&nbsp; Things were going peachy until, in the midst of Boss 6, 1 enchanter died due to the lag, another enchanter went LD and 2 clerics LD'd as well.&nbsp; So we cleared the ring and finished boss 6 with no problems.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/youhaveslain_underking.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>It sucks to have to stop the ring not because we can't handle the spawns, but because we can't handle the lag.&nbsp; Oh well, such is life in Everquest.</P><P align=left>Lastly, this week we also waxed Stanos so that <STRONG>Dorana</STRONG> could get her High Elf mask.&nbsp; You know spawn competition is tough when Stanos is dying. . .</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/dorana_hie.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>So hopefully the site manages to stay up for more than 24 hours in a row for once.&nbsp; If it does, I'll try to bring you more frequent updates.&nbsp; And please if the site does go down, feel free to NOT log in or post on our messageboards about it.&nbsp; And if you must send someone the obligatory, *Sup-bro-what's-up-with-the-site?* tells, send them to Crazz.&nbsp;

It seemed appropriate enough to return that fiesty bitch to the earth in the form of a face-down dirt nap.&nbsp; See, Tunare was spending her time charging for SoW's and ports, farming fishbone earrings and training others while Quad Kiting in Growth -- the typical druid bullshit.&nbsp; Rumor has it she was a mangina anyway, using her good looks along with a host of *teehees* and *huggles* to sucker poor saps into giving her phat lewtz.&nbsp; Either way, we took a *Mr. Garrison* approach to her exploits and decided, "The bitch must die."</P><P align=left>Many congrats to all who were present.&nbsp; Everyone showed great perserverence in taking her down.&nbsp; We had two attempts yesterday.&nbsp; After the first attempt we realized that we were doing something incredibly wrong.&nbsp; Being the tactical genius I am I came up with a new strat for try two:&nbsp; Everyone pull your head out of your ass this time.&nbsp; Amazingly, the strat seemed to work.&nbsp; According to my batphone sources VI is already at work nerfing this strat and will be patching all servers soon, returning most heads to the asses from which they came.&nbsp; They have alot of experience in that department.</P><P align=left>So the Scars of Velious have been scarred by LoS, from a_snow_bunny to the Avatar of War.&nbsp; The only safe refuge for mobs these days is in Luclin, behind locked doors with non-existent keys.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Dada's Art</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/dog.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Working As Intended</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/ssrae_bug.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/aowzloottable.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/hinamner.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/lesbianseahorse.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/mannalopeshors.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/rosebowl.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left>Adorean ponders the mystery that is ToV attendance. . . .</P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/adorean_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/crazz_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Desp's post-Tunare request:</P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/despim_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/jangos_Quote.jpg" border=0></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/line_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/rhap_quote.jpg" border=0></P>
