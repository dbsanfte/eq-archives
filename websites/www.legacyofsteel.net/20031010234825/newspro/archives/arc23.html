Yes welcome to the Evil Empire, Legacy of Steel, where the Enchanters nuke and the clerics melee.&nbsp; We have to make an obligatory trip to Grieg's every now and then so that Veneficus can slay that cacksugger who ganked his name.&nbsp; What we here at LoS want to know is, just how did Grieg get that Stalker name through the name filter?</P><P align=left>Moving right along. . .Sunday was a blast.&nbsp; First we headed over to The Deep -- the zone in which Call of the Hero doesn't work for no apparent reason other than to force people to sit on their ass for unruly lengths of time contemplating playing games which don't force you to sit on your ass for unruly amounts of time.&nbsp; The Burrower was up and in addition to having some extremely nice loot, we find the encounter to be hands-down one of the best in Luclin.&nbsp; For once it really seems like VI nailed it on the first try.&nbsp; This encounter is hard, hectic and non-stop fun.&nbsp; When we got to The Deep, the officers started chatting about how our raid composition was a bit thin for this, specifically lacking certain key classes.&nbsp; But we didn't go all the way to The Deep to sit with our thumbs up our asses and not kill the Burrower or die trying.&nbsp; So we said fuck it, and started the script.&nbsp; We were simply jamming.&nbsp; We'd have these big long pauses between each wave (something which can be rare for those of you familiar with doing this).&nbsp; Things were looking good.&nbsp; And then on the last wave of Core Burrowers, the majority of our clerics die on the spawn.&nbsp; At one point we had something like 2 clerics standing.&nbsp; Of course tanks were quick to drop after.&nbsp; Parv logged on late and sent me a tell, "Where should I head -- what are we killing after you guys kill the Burrower?"&nbsp; I reply, "Man, just get here.&nbsp; We're going to wipe-out but don't say anything in /gu please."&nbsp; </P><P align=left>Well, the raid crew we had there yesterday was simply fucking amazing because in spite of things looking as grim as possible, we somehow pulled a victory out of the raid.&nbsp; Not to mention, one of the most exciting kills we've had in a while.&nbsp; Sometimes those near-death experiences are the best ;)</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/burrower_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>The drops were really nice -- a Tunic, Cap and two Shards.&nbsp; While none of this loot is new, two of the items were new to The Nameless so I'll post 'em here for you all to check out:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/ancientburrowercap_loot.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/shardfromunfathomable_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/henric_cap.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><STRONG><EM>Straight outta Halas. . .</EM></STRONG></P><P align=left>After the burrower died, our thirst for blood was still strong.&nbsp; So off to Ahkeva we went!&nbsp; The whole server really hates anytime anything is spawned in AR because the trains that LoS brings from the DS/ME zone to the AR zone are nothing short of epic.&nbsp; Honestly, it's not intentional. . .but I highly recommend not setting up to camp exp anywhere in ME between the DS zone and AR, especially if my clerics and warriors are running through the zone.</P><P align=left>Well, Shei is officially our bitch.&nbsp; Our execution on this guy was FLAWLESS.&nbsp; It's always a nice way to end the night raiding going from a chaotic Burrower-near-loss to a perfectly executed Shei kill.&nbsp; Loot from the Shei was exactly the same as last time.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/shei_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>The Wonderful World of Rhap</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/rhap_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>Well, I had a long discussion with Rhap.&nbsp; We both decided that in the interest of upholding the tradition of fine journalism and cutting edge editorials, Rhap should perhaps take a look at current events and then write up an expose for the webpage.&nbsp; After careful deliberation, Rhap and I decided that this year's Academy Awards would be an appropriate topic for Rhap to tackle.&nbsp; We sent Rhap off to Hollywood to walk the red carpet.&nbsp; Here's what he came back with:</P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/rhap_oscar_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Working as Intended</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/workingasintended_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/asscake_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/harryballzonya_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/ihavebigcack_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/iscrewedyomana_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/kneeuvtork_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/membersarea_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/razfanclub_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/ssnoob_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/stalkercrazz_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/stalkersunion_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/tigolemania_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/tigolenippz_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/torkgurglesme_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/tsrebelion_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_25/crazz_quote.gif" border=0></P></body></html><a name="newsitem1016696786,64967,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>We Have Cluster Flies and Lice At This Time of Year</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Wednesday, March 20, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><html><head>	<title>Untitled</title></head><body><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>    AoW Goes Down. . .</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG>. . .and so does Tork!</STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_21/aow_tork.jpg" border=0></STRONG></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, we were the first to kill the Avatar of War.&nbsp; And the Second.&nbsp; And so on and so on.&nbsp; In order to keep the encounter fresh we came up with a whole new strategy.&nbsp; The amazing part of this strat is that it required absolutely NO casters.&nbsp; All it took was a bard, a pair of kneepads and 20 rogues.&nbsp; Make love not war, right?&nbsp; So we spawned the AoW and sent in Tork, the bard who makes Liberace and Rip Torn look like the poster children for Machismo, and let him work his *magical* ways with the big guy.&nbsp; While AoW was getting his jollies off, we sent in the 20 rogues who quickly backstabbed the mo faka into little pieces, leaving only a pair of Monk Legs, a Bard Mask and a Blade of Carnage behind.&nbsp; All in all, everyone was happy, even Tork, who once done swallowing was noted as saying, "I think I just took more balls to the chin than Yogi Berra."</P><P align=left>Right about now you're all wondering, "But Tigole!&nbsp; What did your casters do during this fight?"&nbsp; Simply put, we sent all our casters off with one mage who proceeded to summon everyone Focus Items!!!&nbsp; Quickly our casters bagged all their Vulak loots, bagged those Tunare loots, bagged their SoL loots and donned their mage summoned Focus Items!&nbsp; Apparently while Tork and the rogues were killing the AoW, our casters were able to kill Veeshan herself.&nbsp; Why put neat-o effects on uber loot when you can just give it to free summoned shit so everyone can be uber!!!&nbsp; I believe VI will be addressing the problem next patch though -- today as a matter of fact -- I have an advanced copy of the Patch Message for you all:</P><P align=left><STRONG><EM>***Patch Message***</EM></STRONG></P><P align=left><STRONG><EM>--Vha'Whateverthefuck the Cursed has REALLY been fixed this time (let's see if those assholes fall for it twice! oops did I just type that in the patch message.&nbsp;
