I don't think I'm spoiling it too much when I say killing Xegony is only an after thought with this encounter, but while I applaud VI for trying to give us alternatives to straight up MT/CH rot fights, this one is waxes tedious and wanes fun very quickly.  And I say this as a melee - a bard even, one who is an active participant in the fight.  I sympathize with the rotation clerics, for whom this fight is akin to a VTesque 30-40 minutes worth of counting to 3 and pressing a hotkey.  Keep trying, VI - at least you're headed in the right direction.<p>If you're looking for a fight that's clearly *not* the way to go, it's PoEB Warlord - call it shaky aggro or mem blur, whatever, it's gay.  Memblur fights aren't fun or exciting, nor do they smack of innovation - more like desperation.  They are frustrating in the sense no matter how well you and your guild might play, if the random number generator comes up bad, you've lost.  Where's the incentive to be skillful?  Anyhow, we killed him,<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/warlord.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-war_quote.png><br>yay</center><p>and I am very proud of the perseverance it took to get here, let alone to down him, but I can't help but be disappointed knowing each subsequent fight is a crapshoot.<p>Ah now - Corinav.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-raz-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-raz_quote.png><p>Now this is a honest to goodness fun fight (except it's in water - fucking annoying) which requires superb communication and coordination vice massive numbers and tons of clerics.  I love the short timer, and I'd actually prefer it were always the min duration, as it leaves you scrambling for an exciting 15 mins.  Forcing players to press themselves vice press their luck makes each phase of the script an accomplishment - the pace also fucks buffwhores.  Getting the right buffs quickly is important, but given ample time to obsess, too often players stray to the wrong side of preparedness by fixating on the minutiae, as if ac and hp alone will stand in the stead of skill in the larger sense of winning.  I can't tell you the number of times we've had despawn happen when many were paralyzed to inaction because 50 people required "just one more buff" to go.  Res Effects and Acid Jet - those are a real man's buffs.  Don't wear out ghetto ae or the fast timer, but more encounters that similarly test a guild would be good.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-raz-3_quote.png><p>Anyhow, I'm not a MT hater, I think it's got a place, and I'm not a designer so you won't get words like negative player competition and enforced group dynamics, but since it becomes impractical to do any thing aside from MT/CH rot for the boss type mobs, I'd ask VI to consider some of the other twists to encounters - a Trial of Lashing writ large, withering archer fire or that find the rabbit one who's name escapes me - sending out a team of ninjas to locate and kill a particular mob or accomplish a specific goal while the rest of the guild takes on swarm.  Oh - and no escort-the-gnome shit - I don't know about you, but if I were in a hurry and people were trying to kill me, I wouldn't be <strong>walking</strong> and I doubt it'd be lollygagging every 10 feet.  I might spout nonsensical gibberish with lots of typos, so kudos to VI for getting some of it right.<p><font size=4><strong>Outwar Cocksuckers Please Stop Posting To Our Board</strong></font><p>And that was asking nicely.<p>I think most boards get hit by miserably lackeys from this site every week or so with some deceptive, false or misleading post containing a tagged link to a site which borderlines on half a dozen counts of wirefraud (just my facetious opinion, I'm not a lawyer - tee hee).  What I've heard, 'heard,' mind you, is some admins are adding outwar and similar to their bad word filters, thus rendering any link posted as garbage.  I personally would encourage other admins to take a strict stance against scum like this - the occasional direct link I could care less about, but not epidemic and potentially disruptive spam at expense to my bandwidth and everyone else's time.<p><hr width=70%><p>A good deal of them are EQ players are in the military and I have gotten mail from a number of you who read this page - something I'm honored by - thanking me for the laugh.  To the contrary, I thank you, all of you, those servicemen and women who are in harm's way that I might wake up tomorrow in a world of unbridled possibility, one better than I left it when I went to sleep, safe in my bed.<p>Since the first murmurs of this country were borne in the hearts of Men, those hopelessly idealistic dreams have been cleft from a unyielding world by the terrible and awesome price of men and women who have died for principle; the very willingness of which such sacrifices have been stewarded, through the tumult of those would seek to suppress them, the voices of Man and the chorus of Men.<p>I mourn for those who have fallen, but I celebrate their lives by making mine one worth having died to live.  Take care of yourselves that you, too, will come back home to live yours - God bless.<p><hr width=70%><p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-frog_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-jej_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-sh_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-sme_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-zar_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-zau_quote.png><p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-aatrex_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-polo_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-quav_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-train_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-vene_quote.png><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body><a name="newsitem1048029043,50572,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Rattle Them Pots And Pans</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Tuesday, March 18, 2003&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork@legacyofsteel.net">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>U P D A T E</strong></font></center><p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/xeg.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-raz_quote.png></center><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>.<p>It's the word I hear 1000 times a day, usually appended with the word "asshole" or similar - and that's just from my guild.  A bit of explanation is in order, certainly.  To be clear, LoS isn't in decline, <p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-gmotd_quote.png></center><p>We're not movelogging, and no, the last time I checked, we hadn't been suspended or banned - but I'll check with Blixtev tomorrow and make sure.<p>No, the reason you've been greeted with a startling lack of updates was collateral damage, falling victim to my hubris, now punctured.<p>For those not familiar with running a popular website, it's not cheap - hosting fees, bandwidth, administration and registration all cost money, and that's before the human costs of providing the content.  LoS was very fortunate - Tigole and Draed have been huge sugerdaddies, but the time came for the members to step up and assume responsibility for what is a showcase of our accomplishments (and luckily for you, my penis stories).<p>So, as I tell the teeming stalkers, I was holding my guild hostage to kick in their fair share of the expenses.  It's simply not fair to those that did and do contribute so much to the guild to get further taken advantage of others who are content to ride on storied coat tails.  LoS might only be an EQ guild, but the people behind the characters are real, the time commitment, the trust and camaraderie are real - and so should be the respect.<p>No justice, no peace; no dues, no updates - this was a matter of principle beyond the simple, almost laughable, sum of individual money.  Principle - I am a slave of duty and my duty is only to clear.  I abhor your infamous calling; I shudder at the thought that I have ever been mixed up with it; but duty is before all - at any price I will do my duty.  At some point, however, I must admit even I became embarrassed with no updates, and plus that fucker Bender was getting way too much face time.  <p>So, now, for nothing more than personal enjoyment I will commence with the updates once more - I'm not asking anyone to agree with the choice I made - at best, I would hope you the readers and my guild would respect the motive and morals behind it.  It was never once about the money.  More than anything, thought, I am disappointed - not that this tactic failed to elicit any sense of similar duty amongst the slackers in the face of a waxing din, but of the base lack of respect it of which it speaks.  Your comments, concerns and questions are always welcome - tork@legacyofsteel.net or send me a tell in-game.<p><font size=4><strong>And Now For Something Completely Different</strong></font><p>So anyhow - LoS certainly has been busy as a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest, but I can't tell you the number of times we've all yelled, 'FUCK EARTH' in frustration - you name a way to fuck us in the ass and that zone's done it, without even the courtesy of a decent reach around.  The shit of it all is that the rings aren't difficult, they are simply long, tedious and buggy - I think some of the dev weren't paying attention during Game Design 101: Making The Game Fun.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-powah_quote.png><p>Even when a ring did reset properly, or a griefer wasn't setting off the Dust Devotees, or all the Triumvs actually spawned, the Arbiter was spawning under the world, or getting stuck in a wall or a GM was blowing us off when reporting these things.  Finally, though, the sun and moon fell into perfect alignment and a right proper beat down was administered,<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/key_loot.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/l-flames_loot.png><br>/bard jiz</center>Other random stuff we got our grubby little hands on:<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/l-cloak_loot.png> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/l-cord_loot.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/l-form_loot.png> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/l-girdle_loot.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/farm.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-fennin_quote.png></center><p>The only good thing about doing earth so damn much the past month - Peregrin.  I'll be optimistic and say we've only done him triple the number of times your average guild will - once you have your keys, piss on going back for that train wreck of an event if at all possible, and who can blame the guild and its officers - doing such a time intensive event for one piece of only "decent" loot is gay.  I'm not here to bitch about that, that's been stated many times - no... it's time for everyone's favorite section...<p><font size=4><strong>Tork Bitches About Bards (Again)</strong></font><p>Zaar, you knew it was coming, so why fight it, baby?<p>See, Peregrin Rockskull drops Drums of the Rathe - the first real percussion upgrade for bards since SoV, and no I don't want to settle for those BoT ones - it's upside down when an exp group can more easily obtain very high quality items than a raid guild... almost as upside down as killing the big dragon and then having to "get more experienced" from killing the pussy yard trash, but I digress.  Anyhow, as it (of course) turns out, the drums are not just rare, they are homogay rare - check across the servers and I'll be shocked if there are 10.  Total.  If the drums/Peregrin are wretchedly gay, then words are really lacking for the Rune Stamped Blade off Avatar of Dust, an encounter no guild in their right mind is going to be doing much if at all once they are keyed up for Xegony - and again, who can blame them, clearing up to spider island alone is a chore, and then the Sigi event itself is easily one of the most painful in PoP to date.  Oh yah, and <strong>then</strong> you go kill the Avatar of Dust for, you guessed it, another exceptionally rare piece of bard gear in a sea of shit.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-kyn_quote.png><p>Can do - I'm going to be positive and assume the devs just overlooked little things like that, and will work towards correcting them.  Part and parcel with that is the hope VI will remember to add in bard song mods to the high end PoTime gear - I've mentioned it before, but by way of example (again), although the Hydro mask is pure own, it's the Singing Mod that's really attractive for a bard.  What happens when a vastly superior all/all 225 hp/mana FT X mask drops - I'd sure love to upgrade to it, but I'm trapped again by the singing mod on the mask a la epic all over again... except now I'm not slaved to just the off hand, but to multiple inventory slots.  I still think giving us another set of AA's, 3 pts each, for the various song skills to bring the mod in line with the current expansion and then letting gear balance itself out normally for all players would be a much cleaner and clearer alternative solution.  As it is under the current state of affairs, you're always going to have either (1) special case bard gear or (2) instrument mods on all/all gear - both of which have huge potential for omission given past itemization.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/chry.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-chry_quote.png><p><font size=4><strong>Moo</strong></font><p>Jesus - I really have no idea what happened here.
