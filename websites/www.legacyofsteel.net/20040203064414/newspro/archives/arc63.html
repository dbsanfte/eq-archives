Looking for more action (had about 30 minutes             before many were logging), we ported to Dreadlands and killed             <STRONG>Gorenaire</STRONG>.&nbsp; There was no real purpose to             killing Gorenaire.&nbsp; Basically, we like killing mobs. . .the             bigger the better, and Gore was there.&nbsp; Plus my twink has been             exping in Dreadlands.&nbsp; Gorenaire can be a pain in the             ass.&nbsp; I think if you asked any one of us tonight why we were             killing Gorenaire, the answer would be the same:&nbsp; Because we             can.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_29/gorenaire_dead_3_28.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Gorenaire: Dead as Cyndi Lauper's             Career</STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Sad part is, Gorenaire put up more of a fight than Ol'             Innosuck.&nbsp;

It's l33t.&nbsp; I             read about it at the Safehouse.&nbsp; CT dropped that godly,             jaw-dropping neck/belt again and it went to             <STRONG>Cyni</STRONG>.&nbsp; He also dropped the cloak which             <STRONG>Galiaan</STRONG> now has.</P>            <P align=left>We finished Fear and some of us were bored.&nbsp;
