            <P></P>
            <P align=left>Patch Day!!!&nbsp; Being a regular Walter Friggin 
            Kronkite I was able to use my sleuth journalistic skills to get my 
            hands on an early version of the patch message:</P>
            <P align=left><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
            <P align=left><STRONG><EM><FONT size=4>Patch Message, Novermber 9, 
            2000</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*The lure line of spells was found to be 
            too effective and has been removed.&nbsp; To compensate we have 
            given Wizards and upgrade to O'Kiell's Radiation called O'Malley's 
            Radiation.&nbsp; This new damage shield now does 3 instead of 2 
            points of damage.</EM></STRONG></P>
            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*The cast time on complete heal was upped 
            to 20 seconds to insure that no rogue or monk ever 
            lives.</EM></STRONG></P>
            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*The spell evacuate now only works 
            outdoors.</EM></STRONG></P>
            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*Druids now have the ability to revive, 
            feign death, backstab, and mesmerize mobs.&nbsp; This was done in an 
            effort to further Verant's Vision that we could create a class that 
            can do everything yet still complain.</EM></STRONG></P>
            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*Due to complaints that Venril Sathir loot 
            drops were not comparable with the difficulty of the mob, we have 
            decided to push VS's spawn time to one month.&nbsp; This should 
            reduce the frequency of *bad* drops signifigantly.</EM></STRONG></P>
            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*We have been hearing complaints of our 
            customers that drop rates were uneven and unbalanced between various 
            dungeons such as Old Sebilis and Chardok, for example.&nbsp; Always 
            in tune with our customers wants, we moved the Sarnak Battle Shield, 
            Golem Tear Ring, and Incardine armor to the Old Sebilis 
            crypt.</EM></STRONG></P>
            <P align=left><EM><STRONG>*Rangers were removed from the game -- we 
            give up.</STRONG></EM></P>
            <P align=left>And now back to the news. . .</P>
            <P align=left>Yesterday started in typical fashion -- another day, 
            another dragon slaying. . .This time it was <STRONG>Zordak 
            Ragefire</STRONG>, whose death resulted in <STRONG>Amulek</STRONG> 
            being able to complete his Epic Weapon Quest.&nbsp; Amulek now has 
            two wet noodles hanging from his waist instead of just one.&nbsp; 
            Zordak also dropped some nifty gloves which went to <STRONG>Uggly 
            Fleshbeater</STRONG> and a breastplate which <STRONG>Signel</STRONG> 
            now wears.&nbsp; Dear god, I just used the word *nifty* someone 
            please shoot me.</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt="Zordak Deaddragon" 
            src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november/11_9/zordak.jpg" 
            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>After Zordak, I happened to be wandering through 
            <STRONG>Dreadlands</STRONG> so I popped my head into 
            <STRONG>Karnor's Castle</STRONG> to see if my ol' buddy 
            <STRONG>Venril</STRONG> was around.&nbsp; To my surprise and 
            delight, Venril was. . .UP!&nbsp; I often wonder what it's like to 
            have a lifespan of approximately 45 minutes.&nbsp; Well, I don't 
            wonder too hard.</P>
            <P align=center><IMG 
            alt="Venril, put your hands on the ground, you have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used. . ."

            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>Here's the <STRONG>Venril Sathir Loot</STRONG> which 
            has not yet been awarded.&nbsp; By tomorrow you should know who the 
            lucky Pally is.</P>

            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>Then we cleared Islands 1-4 in <STRONG>Plane of 
            Air</STRONG> completing two quests.&nbsp; At that point 
            <STRONG>Ariel</STRONG> was contacted by a <STRONG>Captain Richard 
            Izinia</STRONG> of the <STRONG>United States Marine 
            Corps</STRONG>.&nbsp; It seems the USMC is seeking tips on 
            efficiency from <STRONG>Legacy of 
            Steel</STRONG>.</P></FONT></SPAN> </STRONG>
