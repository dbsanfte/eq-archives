Now, many of you long time             visitors to the site are probably wondering, what took you guys so             long to kill that dorf mo faka?&nbsp; Well, early on when SoV came             out we had the Dain *poof* on us 5 times.&nbsp; Eventually, we got             so deep into our faction (pro-dragon) that the Dain became a low             priority.&nbsp; Recently we had a discussion about this little fool             dorf and decided that he should die if for no other reason because             he is a DORF.&nbsp; And because he is there.&nbsp; </P>            <P align=left>The fight was a freakin blast.&nbsp; A few guilds on             The Nameless took some shots at Dain Fleshbeater earlier in the week             and sent me tells saying that it was the "poosae" Dain.&nbsp; Well,             it wasn't.&nbsp; The little King of the Desps was hitting for             425's.&nbsp; Anyway, pulling him is always interesting to say the             least.&nbsp; Was nice to have him not poof.&nbsp; I forgot to take             many screenshots during the battle because I was busy doing other             stuff (mostly stabbing the fuck outta Dorfman).&nbsp; But I did snap             this one pic. . .not much to look at, but something nonetheless:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april/4_3/dainfight.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Here's what could be found on that foul, stout,             stinking carcass of the Dain:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april/4_3/dainshead.jpg"             border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april/4_3/frostreaver.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april/4_3/frostreavercrown.jpg"             border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april/4_3/ringofwinter.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Lucky for us, being a guild of giant fuckeruppers, it             will be quite sometime before you'll see a Dorf belt on one of             us.&nbsp;

Lots of our members were engaged in the guildwar             Tenaj organized.&nbsp; Apparently, everyone was having a             blast.&nbsp; The rest of us were just sort of dicking around, doing             exp, quests etc.&nbsp; After awhile we got bored and decided to kill             something.&nbsp; Inny was up.&nbsp; We didn't really have enough to             kill Inny.&nbsp; But we went up to Hate anyway.&nbsp; People pulled             in friends from their exp groups.&nbsp; We were a rag-tag             bunch.&nbsp; I must say, it turned out to be one of the funnest             fights in a while.&nbsp; In the age of the gimp-rush (thanks             server-side filtering), there is still no greater feeling than             taking down a mob with less than substantial numbers.&nbsp; So only             one new item that LoS has not seen yet.&nbsp; This bracer:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april/4_1/hotofsbracer.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>The bracer went to Nizzarr.&nbsp; Other drops included             a Dorf Cloak that went to the bearded lady, Kineku.&nbsp; Ogre             earring for the lovely Joboba.&nbsp; Eye of Inny that will help Yvin             complete his epic one day.&nbsp; And I looted the Leatherfoot             Sandals.</P>            <P align=left>I started a thread on the Safehouse about these             sandals.&nbsp; The whole balance of Everquest as we know it lies in             peril over a GREAT mistake made with this item.&nbsp; When worn, the             sandals look like leather boots.&nbsp; This is no good.&nbsp; Let us             Halflings show off our sexy, furry feet.&nbsp; We want NO graphic on             these sandals.&nbsp; For the love of the Vale, Verant, correct this             horrible mistake.&nbsp; It's a priority as I see it.</P>            <P align=left>Ok, I could ramble more but I am slightly hungover and             am going on 4 hours of sleep so fuck it.</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april/4_1/cynisvaginnna.jpg"             border=0></P>
