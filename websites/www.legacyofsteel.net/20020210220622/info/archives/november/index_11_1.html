            after Amulek had dispensed all his candy, he resorted to passing out

            just dandy till we recieved an urgent distress call that a Dragon 
            was assaulting the masses in <STRONG>Lake of Ill 
            Omen</STRONG>.&nbsp; Upon arrival we were shocked to see it was our 
            old rival, <STRONG>Faydedar</STRONG>, more commonly known among our 
            ranks as:&nbsp; <STRONG>THE FEEEEESH</STRONG>.          </p>

        <p align="left">Finally to our Hero!&nbsp; The 
            <STRONG>Feesh</STRONG> actually dropped a much needed quest item 
            which puts <STRONG>Nizzarr</STRONG> only one item away (a 
            <STRONG>Venril Sathir</STRONG> drop) from completing his Epic Weapon 
            Quest.&nbsp; This seemed especially appropriate since it was Nizzarr 
            who kited the Feesh away from a mass of corpses and pulled it to our 
            awaiting army where we promptly laid the ol' LoS smack-down.&nbsp; 
            But the Feesh dropped another item as well. . .a <STRONG>Crystalline 
            Spear</STRONG>.&nbsp; In the spirit of the holiday, we decided that 
            rather than horde this item to ourselves, it would be put to better 
            use in the hands of a fledgling backstabber.&nbsp; Our ultimate 
            choice was <STRONG>the mighty Tikker Gimblestan</STRONG>, who is no 
            doubt already unleashing a reign of terror across the face of 
            Norrath.          </p>

            <P align=left>A major wrench was thrown in our plans with the 
            movement of today's patch.&nbsp; No big deal.&nbsp; We tried to help 
            <STRONG>Arlos</STRONG> complete his Epic Weapon Quest but 
            unfortunately the quest is bugged and where two mobs are supposed to 
            spawn, only one showed up for the beat-down.&nbsp; Luckily, the GM's 
            reimbursed Arlos with the items he lost by turning them in so we can 
            try again tomorrow and hope for the luck of <STRONG>Verant</STRONG> 
            to be on our side (cough, cough).&nbsp; If nothing else, Arlos and 
            the rest of us our confident that the quest bugs will be squashed in 
            the patch that was conveniently delayed today.</P>

            <P align=left>In other "guild news" it was an exciting day as Alam 
            McHealer joined the ranks today.&nbsp; We were in dire need of a 
            level 28 cleric and Alam McHealer was the prime candidate.&nbsp; 
            After accepting our pleas for him to wear the &lt;Legacy of 
            Steel&gt; badge above his head, we let Alam McHealer have his way 
            with Despie, guild slooot and all-around fun time on two legs.&nbsp; 
            Here are some screen-caps of the momentous event.</P>
