But every now and then, the story of one can be used             to illustrate the cohesiveness and dominance of friendship through             arms.</P>            <P align=left>When we last left the Halfling Hero of this Story,             let's call him. . . oh. . . um. . . <STRONG>Tigole Bitties</STRONG>.             . .he was hard at work with the <STRONG>Minstrel Jangos</STRONG> and             the <STRONG>Mighty Barbarian Leick</STRONG> in <STRONG>Mistmoore             Castle</STRONG>.&nbsp; The unlikely threesome was not after             Treasure, they simply wanted to shed the blood of those who the             <STRONG>Ring of Scale</STRONG> opposed.&nbsp; You see, this Trio was             in the business of Dragon-slaying.&nbsp; Perhaps this picture from             yesterday will refresh your memory of what Jangos, Leick and Tig did             to right themselves in the eyes of the Ring:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt="Questing for Faction"             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/faction_1027.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>When the three went their seperate ways for the night,             they went to bed resting easy, knowing&nbsp;that they had fixed             their standing with the Fiery Denizens that plagued the Land.</P>            <P align=left>But then <STRONG>Tig</STRONG> went for a little stroll             in the <STRONG>Emerald Jungle</STRONG>.&nbsp; He had heard that             there was a Dragon running loose.&nbsp;But Emerald Jungle, while a             long and harrowed journey from Rivervale, was a relatively safe             place for a Halfling who had spent some hard time righting himself             in the eyes of the ring of Scale.&nbsp; Everything was looking his             way. . .He picked some wild flowers to give to his love,             <STRONG>Umberlee</STRONG>.&nbsp; He laughed as he passed the quiet             young couple known as <STRONG>Tenaj</STRONG> and             <STRONG>Winkin</STRONG>.&nbsp; No, he told them, I don't know what             this <STRONG>HGS</STRONG> is you two seek so openly.</P>            <P align=left><STRONG>Tigole</STRONG> returned to his journey,             sneaking a bit more cautiously after meeting the *<EM>odd</EM>*             fellows.&nbsp; And then. . .out of no where. . .he got. . .             kicked.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=Whoops!             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/kick_10_29.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Well, anyone who knows the Halfling, knows that he             doesn't take a kick to the rump in stride.&nbsp; If there was one             thing Tig could always count on, it was his friends.&nbsp;             "Kicked!?" they declared, when brought the odd news.&nbsp;"No, no             no."&nbsp; With upmost haste, the guild of friends assembled in the             Emerald Jungle.&nbsp; "Try that kick again," they said.&nbsp; Only             this time, <STRONG>Severilous</STRONG> found himself on the wrong             end of the boot.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt="Severilous strikes a pose"             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/sever_10_29.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Upon the stinking, dead carcass of the dragon they             found some interesting loot.&nbsp; <STRONG>Keke Dabadoo</STRONG>,             Troll Warrior, found a <STRONG>Red</STRONG> and a <STRONG>Green             Dragon scale</STRONG>. . .two items he had been questing for as they             were rumored to be needed for a long and epic sword quest.&nbsp;             <STRONG>Demius the Dorf</STRONG> found a <STRONG>Treasure Hunters             Satche</STRONG>l which greatly reduced the weight of his             possessions.&nbsp; Some other interesting items were found:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=Horn             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/horn_10_29.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt="It's got a beat but you can't dance to it"             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/selos_10_29.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt="Dragon Bracelet"             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/dragon_bracer_10_29.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>This last item the adventurers let             <STRONG>Tigole</STRONG> keep as a reminder of his             <STRONG>Kick</STRONG>.&nbsp; It was a special item to the Halfling             since those of his race could not normally wear items of this             sort.&nbsp; I wish I could report a happy ending to this story, but             unfortunately <STRONG>Tigole</STRONG> was killed shortly after this             event by the infamous <STRONG>Cliff</STRONG>             <STRONG>Monster</STRONG> of <STRONG>Emerald Jungle</STRONG>.&nbsp;             The <STRONG>Princess Umberlee</STRONG> was left Widowedand             Heartbroken.&nbsp; I guess since there needs to be a happy ending to             this tale, we'll end this as a "Fairy" tale,&nbsp;
