Hot damn, I sit wrong and bind my sack up in my boxers just the least bit and I'm squirming to adjust things, but they seem to wear a little bit of pinched sack like a badge of wrinkled honor.  You can't help but notice it, I swear I think some of them try to split the twins, one to each side like taunt fuzzy fleshed Mickey Mouse ears gone all wrong.<p>I mean, I've been in the gym before doing step or on the Stairmaster and things ride up and my sack starts chafing, that gets my attention real damn fast - but these dudes seem almost oblivious to scrubbing their nuts on whatever passes by.  Add the hazy, hot and humid weather and everyone's scrotum pools out into a limp 3 foot puddle, so imagine the effect all those benches and chairs further heated in the sun have on sack already tugged and forcible distended from the polite confines of clothing - it looks like pancakes draped over the edges and occasionally hoisted up and spread out in their laps like a well worn and open catcher's mitt - this is fucking <strong>male camel toe</strong>.  And then they run - I swear to God I've heard flapping before as inertia and loose skin work in horrible tandem.<p>In a move jolting revulsion to my core, I saw this one old dude slide into a booth AND DRAG HIS NUTS on the edge of the table.  MOTHERFUCKER - and I *liked* that table, but come this fall when *I* want to go out to eat in *my* city to watch *your* tax dollars pay for beach sand restoration I sure as shit can't sit there, and it doesn't matter how much antibac or industrial cleaner they throw on it, that table's been defiled by sweaty Canadian sack and lost to me forever.<p>So anyhow, as I morn the loss of innocence and a celebrate a day off, we bounced around VT and killed shit in its proper place - how boring.<p><center> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/jk.jpg></center><p>While we were there, the GM staff, as on apparently all servers, purged the corpses, I guess in lieu of disabling CoH (at least until the patch).  I have mixed feelings on this: Surely if they do intend to remove CoH, they *must* revamp the zone, which is a good thing - this just forces their hand as doing VT from start to finish is just not something anyone is willing to do, no matter how good the loot is or even could be  post patch - you'll forgive me for restating the obvious, but most EQ players have by now realized that stats, resists and hp/mana beyond the basics are meaningless, after a certain point it really doesn't matter - in the end, these twilight moments of EQ are going to be spent having fun with your guildmates, and picking up items that expand our repertoire of abilities with fun procs, right clicks, monster DDs, illusions, horses, &c becomes far more desirable vice chasing some softcap.  I hope VI will bear this in mind for future loot and encounters - getting 125 hp/mana gear in every slot is a reality now, but it's lost its luster in the face of a game showing its age.  That's not a slam or a jab, it's the truth.<p>At any rate, I'm not comfortable with them removing CoH yet - remember how many incarnations a basic encounter in Ssra took to get (sorta) right?  AL is just one example, because I can also point to Vulak for a textbook HOWTO gannfest on the large scale.  So I'm split, if you remove CoH, then we all have to wait even longer at the zone for a *full* raid force to log in, vice clearing and CoH'ing the late comers - the spell's original intent is just as valid today as it was when conceived and as long as we can still ghetto CoH, all you've done is inconvenience us when it comes to moving around - for a high end raid guild, it's just... oh yah: time consuming.<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/goo.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/dxv.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/henric_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/dxx.jpg><br>Guess who pulled?<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/veil_loot.gif> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/tork-flaming.jpg> <br>NOT GAY<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/rune_loot.png> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/view_loot.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/blowjob.jpg><br>We also picked up another member of the famous Nameless Dorfs - welcome Blowjob!</center><p><font size=4>WE KNOW&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DRAMA</strong></font><p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/voro_quote.png><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_02/voro-ct.jpg><br>Unfortunately, he made it - everyone else, however...</center><p>And in closing, a lot people asked what we did the Day After - would we lay down and whimper, would we lick our wounds, would this be the nail in the LoS coffin?

The circumstances surrounding the situation have been resolved, at least to some degree.<p><strong>I want to thank everyone for the wild support</strong> we received, it is a large part of why this issue came to a head - <a href=http://www.gucomics.com/>Woody</a> and many, many others have asked what exactly happened - to which I've had to respond with some degree of vagueness.  To be clear, this isn't due to any sort of cover up from our perspective and yes, I am aware of appearances, however I'm not going to disclose an exact chain of events while members of the guild are in discussions with VI - after this is <strong>completely</strong> resolved, yes, but I am not willing to impinge upon any current appeals and/or dialog just to sate a Usenet troll (or even cool guys like Woody, who are willing and able to see things from both sides).<p>Suffice it to say none of the alleged means the GM stated were used - in point of fact, player gflux is disabled in that zone and if you must know, the pull did not and does not involve a monk whatsoever.  Moving on, the Warders were down when we did the pull as the previous day we'd bounced CoH around VT to kill their parent mobs, thereby despawning each appropriate Warder.  The random key nonsense is just that - the keys are no rent but it is merely an exercise in annoyance to nurse them via corpse or decess/CoH to get the needed one every 55 mins in the case of any Key Drama&trade;... we've done it both ways~<p>Pulling mini-Aten to goo room in Vex Thal is exactly analogous to what has been the de facto standard for pulling the Dain from his spawn point to the pit in Thurg B for 18+ months: aggro transfer leads to the mob warping vice explicit pathing to the character, that is the mob will appear suddenly on top of and/or immediately adjacent to the aggro character vice running towards the character.<p>With regards to what happened prior to the GM appearing, the guild CoH'd to the goo room and staged in one of the small annexes.  A player acquired mini-Aten on target and proceeded to aggro her - and not by any of the means the GM alleges.  We actually wiped out the first attempt as multiple mobs warped down in addition to mini-Aten and we were unprepared - things are not 100% certain in VT and there is real risk and certain death on each pull, regardless of means. On the second attempt, mini-Aten was solo and we executed a near flawless kill, the only problem being some odd lag which allowed the main tank to die once.  At any rate, the GM /killed (despawned) the mob with less than 1% health remaining, and after which you can read the web page and log for what transpired.  Had the GM actually witnessed the pull, it would not be possible for him to even voice such as the events were plainly visible to even the most casual observer, again, however I'm not prepared to disclose the exact method as our officers are still in dialog with VI.<p>That being said, I was extremely angry and frustrated over what I saw as sheer ignorance writ large and the people left to suffer the consequences were my guildmates and friends. As I posted before in our private section: I'm from The South, we could make a sailor blush saying good morning so it's no surprise I fired off a myriad of fuck you's, however, in retrospect, the personal insults/2 inch cock thing were excessive, even then - but I stand by the crux of my post: we got hosed and customer service at VI is in dire need of an attitude adjustment. <p>To the good guys at VI CS, and there are some, I apologize for casting my scathing net too far - I certainly don't mean to imply everyone there, especially the guides who work under extremely demanding circumstances, volunteering their time to make this a better environment to game, is worthy of scorn, and to Blixtev, I offer an apology - I was out of line with some of my comments on the personal level - that was uncalled for by any standard.<p>It is my hope we can put stuff like this behind us all and move forward with the lines of communication now, in some part, open among players, VI and the CS department.  Our common goal is to play this game and have fun.<p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p>Regular update tomorrow - I still love my crew of stalkers in a non-gay way.<br><dd>PS: Dodging the namefilter and GM's gets you bonus points.<p><font size=4><strong>Quote of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_29/wolf_quote.png><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body><a name="newsitem1030511901,86510,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>And The Grand Facade, So Soon Will Burn</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Tuesday, August 27, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork@legacyofsteel.net">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>Rigoddamndiculous</strong></font></center><p>Hey - so, like - who here's been suspended for pulling the Dain?

Holy Jesus - better not watch fucking Vindi pull 4 times a day, you're not gonna like what you see there either, you dumb fuck.  PS:  The warders *are* down, Aten hasn't respawned from the last time we killed her and as for lack of content, that's Shawl 9 and 10 - the Coldain royals are still in place.  Anyhow, since all guilds and all players are treated *exactly* the same, all the other servers doing VT *exactly* the same should watch out, too - right Alan?<p>Maybe Blixtev is just trying to get his 15 mins of fame on the web page, maybe even he was under the impression he was crafty and leet, waiting to poof the corpse right after the kill (hint: you're not), but I'm going to go with my gut feeling and call it "fucking retarded" - it's more than a little disappointing to see some customer service jack off who'd never earn a shot at seeing the inside of VT on his own come swooping in to ride our ass in a fit of retard rampage.<p>Well you go boy, think how fucking proud you must be - congrats - you did what lame zone design, gay mobs, fucking worthless encounters and even mindless key camps couldn't do:  you ruined a night of fun for the Evil Empire - cong.  I bet your balls are just clanking back and forth as you swagger around VI Customer Support with all 2 inches of  cock wadded up in your meaty fist, jizzing to the chants of fellow cubical bound cocksuckers such as yourself who likewise have zero in-game experience beyond a "Greetings!" hotkey and hot cyber exchanged for favors, like flying out a player and banging her in SD then banning her former RL boyfriend.  Hypothetically - cause we all know that'd never happen, customer-GM fraternization is strictly forbidden and such a grievous breech would have been investigated immediately - right Alan?<p>Raise the bar on what it takes to be a Customer Service <strong>Representative</strong> - that word is not just part of a weak resume working at a mall kiosk hawking cell phones.  I could embarrass you guys further and post some screenshots of guides and GM's asking basic fucking questions which are almost laughable until something this asinine occurs and it hits home just how bottom of the barrel EQ's gotten.  Fuck good intentions and fuck you guys down in VI HQ for letting things degenerate to this point - you had a good game and you had a great community, but stupid fucking <strong>stunts</strong> belie the hype: shit is rotten to the core in Norrath and San Diego - any dev/designer worth a damn jumped ship long ago, class balance is a joke, itemization is full-on Monty Hall, zones are buggy, encounters are busted and if SoV was a rushed delivery expansion, then SoL is a full on abortion.  This final insult to injury isn't just roving clueless cocksucker GM's on power trips, it's that with all the incredible millions you guys are sucking each month, you can't be bothered to hire and <strong>retain</strong> competent help from, and here's that dirty word again, Customer Service Representatives - guess what?  You hire at minimum wage, you get minimum wage talent.  Don't get me wrong, VI's had some great GM's and guilds in the past - but you cocksuckers fired them or drove them off from equally inane internal politics and rules meant to bind and restrict - it's no wonder you're left with the current stable of bitter fucking gimps getting revenge for all those times they got trained by specs in Oasis.<p>Hey - any games in beta need a high end raid guild to check our your content?  Email me - <a href=mailto:tork@legacyofsteel.net>tork@legacyofsteel.net</a>!  In case you fucking retards don't get it, check out the logs from your high end guilds - I'm not trying to brag, I'm pointing out an honest fact: raid guilds get you guys a lot of attention, a lot of free press and - summary for the financial fucks: <font color=green>$$$$$<strong><font color=ltgreen>PROFIT</font></strong>$$$$$</font> - right Alan?<p>I really can't express how angry I am right now, but I'm at ground zero for a real watershed event: it's time to go.  It's never been more clear it's time for another game, you cocksuckers just aren't interested in making EQ better and we're the stupid hopeful fucking fools who continued to hold out when it's high past time for you fucks down in the Brain Trust to have pulled your head out of your asses and made a palatable product.  Stop making content so utterly fucking gay we're forced to keep corpses to nurse keys and CoH spots - cut and paste probably seemed so leet when you were designing a zone, but hey guess what?  It's fucking lame.  It's fucking lame that you abandon zones (inner Acrylia, anyone?) and content because fixing them would require thought and effort - probably asking too much, I know - you guys are the same fucktards who thought a DT every 15 seconds for a 40 minute fight was acceptable to release.  You don't even have the common decency to disable dead end quests and story lines so the intrepid players who refuse to break down and read the spoiler sites don't get the shaft after wasting God knows how many hours only to be greeted with a broken combine or sent scurrying around searching for non-existent items.  Me personally, I'd be embarrassed to ship that kind of shit which so obviously screams, 'ONLY 22 MORE SHOPPING DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS!" with my name on it.  The credits to this expansion read like a blacklist to future work in the industry.<p>So guess what, cocksuckers?  We're going to start really playing the game on our terms, and like in Animal House, you'll probably be happier later in life if you weren't here right now.<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_27/trade.png></center><p><p>I'd call Blixtev's maneuver tonight a Pyrrhic victory, but first of all half you motherfuckers wouldn't go scrambling for the dictionary and it's eloquence would be lost, but in truth it's not even that:  this is horse shit and if it's not too much trouble to pull that dick our your mouth, I want some fucking answers.  I trust someone there has a clue - right Alan?<p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_27/blixtev.jpg><p><font size=4><strong>Quote of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_27/rhap_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_27/voro_quote.png><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body>
