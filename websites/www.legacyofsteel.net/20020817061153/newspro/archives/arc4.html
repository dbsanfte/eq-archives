The truth is you wont be seeing many more, if any, updates from me.&nbsp; I will do my best to sneak one in here or there when time permits but for all intents and purposes this may well be the last update I do here.&nbsp; No need to worry folks, I am currently working on the next update crew which will provide all of you freaks and social mifits plenty of good reading while at work, home or the computer room in Bellevue Hospital.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>For those of you who don't know, I hardly play Everquest anymore.&nbsp; When I switched jobs, my hours also changed, and the way things work now, I am never online during the *normal* raid hours of Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; In fact, I don't even have much time to log in any more regardless.&nbsp; I am lucky if I can log in at all.&nbsp; As a result I have also stepped down as leader of the guild.&nbsp; There are only a few people I'd wager in all of EQ who understand what it takes to run a guild like Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; Sure there is a plethora of guilds out there.&nbsp; But very few function and succeed at the level of Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; A guild like ours cannot succeed with a leader who is not online.&nbsp; I realize this.&nbsp; The last thing I wanted to do was run the guild into the ground by being a non-presence.&nbsp; So I stepped down to make room for new leadership so the guild could move forward without me.&nbsp; There are far too many talented, skilled mo fakas in LoS to force them to wait around till their slacker leader could log in.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>But don't get your hopes up, homies, I'm not quite quitting EQ just yet.&nbsp; I still have far too many friends on The Nameless to stop logging in.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Speaking of logging in, I hadn't been able to get online for a week and when I finally had a minute of free time I decided to play EQ.&nbsp; So I log onto the Nameless and found my character standing at the zone in to Ssra Temple.&nbsp; I say hi to everyone in guildchat. . they were off somewhere raiding.&nbsp; Two seconds later Pain and Suffering strikes me.&nbsp; I die instantly.&nbsp; Wow, cool, I think to myself.&nbsp; That's a neat new "feature". . .instant death to anyone who doesn't log in for over a week.&nbsp; I petition for a GM res since I died to NOTHING standing at the ZONE IN.&nbsp; While I am waiting for a GM to get back to me the guild gets engaged in some big Ragefire drama (you know that *fixed* spawn that no longer has any problems).&nbsp; After waiting for hours for no GM res, not even a response from a guide, I go to ME to camp the VT shard with Rhap.&nbsp; That was my *fun* night of EQ.&nbsp; Somehow it seemed almost poetic to me that the one night I was able to play in weeks was spent a) dying to NOTHING b) not getting any customer service c) Ragefire Drama d) VT shard camp.&nbsp; Fun, fun, fun.&nbsp; When will it ever stop!</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Now, I realize some of you are just bursting with curiosity, wondering how I've been spending my time since I am not putting much of it into EQ.&nbsp; Well, I work.&nbsp; Lots.&nbsp; I come home late at night and watch midnight World War II documentaires and listen to Pink Floyd.&nbsp; Then I sleep.&nbsp; Then I work more.&nbsp; Then I work some more.&nbsp; Then I log into EQ and die to nothing,&nbsp; Then work some more.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>But today I have off!&nbsp; So I decided to spend some quality time with all my friends here at legacyofsteel.net.&nbsp; After this I think I'll&nbsp;sit on the patio and listen to some Bob and drink a beer.&nbsp; That's how retired EQ heroes spend their time, right?&nbsp; Who knows, maybe I'll even log onto The Nameless and kill some shit later. . .</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Before I wrap this up I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who participated on our forums, sent me email and a special thanks to all the Stalkers.&nbsp; The Stalkers ranged from psychotic prison rapists, to closet comedians, to deranged lunatics and I loved every last one of them.&nbsp; I feel truly lucky that I was fortunate enough to get to speak with so many people from so many different servers.&nbsp; After all, what makes EQ great is the people -- the community.&nbsp; And I feel like I got to experience more of the community than anyone else who ever played this game.&nbsp; I hope you guys had as much fun as I did participating in this site.&nbsp; And don't worry, like I said earlier, I promise to deliver a crew who will continute the tradtion of legacyofsteel.net.&nbsp; Goddamn, I read other EQ websites and they are such hack, wanna-be's of this site it's pathetic.&nbsp; From my own server to servers I never knew existed, I see people ripping this site off and doing a lousy job of it.&nbsp; So fear not, faithful LoS readers, we will soon rescue you from the masses of wanna-be's out there.&nbsp; Shit, even my wanna-be's have wanna-be's. . .</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Lastly, I want to say a special thanks to everyone in the guild.&nbsp; I posted a message to everyone in our private forums but I just want to say publicly what a special group of people you are.&nbsp; You guys are truly the only reason I'll ever click that "connect" button again.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>So good luck everyone.&nbsp; Although you won't see much of me around anymore in EQ, you sure as hell&nbsp;haven't seen the last of Tigole Bitties.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT size=4><STRONG>The Wonderful World of Rhap</STRONG></FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/rhap_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/rhap_2_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/rhap_3_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/britishloser_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/kikuinhead_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/obiwankenobi_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/ownedbyanoob_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/pisporstalker_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/liberace_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/prostitude_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/vladedivac_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>Nice of you to log in from the Golf Course to say hi, Vlade</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/wannajumptigole_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the Day</FONT></STRONG></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/crazz_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/cyni_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/parv_quote.gif" border=0></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align=center><A href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif" border=0></A></P></body></html><a name="newsitem1021531378,46822,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>The Way Things Are Going They're Gonna Crucify Me</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Wednesday, May 15, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><html><head>	<title>Untitled</title></head><body><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>                                                                                Shadows          of Frustration</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left>My apologies for not updating the site in so long.&nbsp; Things have been extremely hectic for me and my schedule is only going to get worse.&nbsp; So when I get to log in for the one hour a night I've been getting lately, I get to deal with all you rotten cacksuggers who log in and tell me how long it's been since the last update.&nbsp; Well, here's your goddamned update.</P><P align=left>So it's that time again -- yes the time you've learned to love to hate or hate to love -- time for me to rant about something.&nbsp; Now, I'm going to come straight out with a disclaimer on this one.&nbsp; I am whining.&nbsp; I'll save some jackass the 15 seconds of glory he'll get by posting on the forums, telling me to STFU cause I'm whining.&nbsp; Because I am.&nbsp; This is pure, hardcore, old school, whining coming your way.&nbsp; </P><P align=left>For those of you who follow this site closely, you'll remember that last week we got the Emperor down to next to nothing.&nbsp; In fact, this is the screenshot I posted of his damage bar:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may_02/5_7/emp_dmg_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Basically, we knew exactly how to kill the Emperor, but we fucked up.&nbsp; I wont go into the details but it was a clear mistake we made and we knew how to fix it.&nbsp; Well, patch day rolls around and guess who gets changed?&nbsp; Yup, the Emp.&nbsp; Now, the good thing is, they removed the Deathtouch -- the single cheapest attack a mob can have in a game.&nbsp; But what is frustrating is, 3 or 4 guilds had killed the Emperor, gotten their VT powersources and are now free to spoil the zone as they see fit.&nbsp; For all the people who had never tried the Emp, well, no big deal for them really.&nbsp; But the ones who really got slapped in the face were guilds like mine.&nbsp; Guilds that were an attempt away from being in VT, who had spent weeks learning one encounter, only to find that encounter gone one day with a totally new mob (just using the old name) waiting to spawn after blood dies.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong -- in a way it's poetic justice for the handful of guilds that got their powersources.&nbsp; More power to them.&nbsp; They were first and earned what they got.&nbsp; But goddamn I hate feeling like I got cheated.&nbsp; The whole ordeal just screams of poor design and lack of forsight.</P><P align=left><STRONG>Speaking of poor design and lack of forsight, how shitty is it that Blood drops such godly loot?&nbsp; Yes, Luclin loot needed an upgrade.&nbsp; But to anyone with half a clue, how about realizing that Blood is a TRIGGER SPAWN.&nbsp; Did we not learn from SoV????&nbsp; Can't we make it so that there's NO reason AT ALL to kill a trigger spawn???&nbsp; Why, oh why, please explain to me why, would anyone put GODLY loot on a TRIGGER SPAWN??&nbsp; Why does it take a loudmouth motherfucker to bring this shit to light?&nbsp; Jesus, it's common sense.&nbsp; The question is, will the braintrust of San Diego wait until the clusterfuck of blown Emp spawns begins, the endless rantings of assholes such as myself, or will someone realize the horrible mistake of putting loot on Blood now and fix the mo faka ASAP?&nbsp; Only time will tell. . .</STRONG></P><P align=left>And because I mentioned&nbsp;time. . .what's there to do when you cannot see VT because the final quest mob got patched before you killed it?&nbsp; What's there to do when you have 10 nice shards sitting in the bank collecting dust?&nbsp; Well, not much.&nbsp; When in doubt, Guildwar.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may_02/5_14/challenge_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may_02/5_14/guildwarr_2.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may_02/5_14/guildwar_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>Yeah, when bordom strikes nothing beats a trip to Steamfont to kill some Gnomes.&nbsp;
