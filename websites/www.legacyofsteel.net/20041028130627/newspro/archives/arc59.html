Truth is we got caught up in Patch Hell over on The             Gameless server.&nbsp; I don't really find it too exciting posting             the same CT kills over and over.&nbsp; Have I mentioned I *REALLY*             hate patches no matter how nice that CT loot is?&nbsp; We killed a             ton of a shit last week.&nbsp; Zland, Kland, MotG, CT, Dain. . .all             multiple times.&nbsp; Actually we only got one Dain kill in.&nbsp;             Luckily the other l33t guilds on our server are now *owning* the             Dain.&nbsp; So far he has dropped nothing for them and Dinged up to             level 76 but thank god the Evil Empire that is Legacy of Steel is             not getting the loots!</P>            <P align=left>So, now that I have been an asshole and managed to             piss off a fair percentage of our server, I will continue with this             fine journalism we here at legacyofsteel.net (we being me and my             dog, Jack) call the morning update.&nbsp; As you can see from the             above picture, I recently acquired this toy:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/guiseofthecoercer.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Basically, I was bored.&nbsp; Endless patches and time             in Fear will do that to you.&nbsp; I couldn't stomache another night             on Stormfeather's spawn.&nbsp; So I re-did the Ragebringer quest (in             one day Ccc.) and then took my homeboys to wax this cacksugger:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/stanosdead.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Stanos.&nbsp; Let me see, I will say something and             then have to deal with the know-it-all bastages in the General Forum             but I will say this anyway: Stanos is the most Bad-ass mob you will             fight in the Old World (not counting PoA).&nbsp; Stanos is not             terribly difficult with a full guild raid.&nbsp; Problem is, you             don't schlep an entire guild to go to Highold so you can get a             mask.&nbsp; You ask nicely during some free time and hope people are             willing to help.&nbsp; I think I gathered around 24 or so.&nbsp;             Stanos, even with 24, was a VERY tough fight but it was fun.&nbsp;             We dropped him on our first try.&nbsp; Kind of funny considering             that the next day we went back for more with about the same numbers             and got owned twice before dropping him a second time for             Chon.&nbsp; Minor changes in group composition made the             difference.&nbsp; While fighting Stanos is fun, I must say the best             part about it is getting heckled by the noobs in Highold.&nbsp; So             this is what ya get when you kill Stanos:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/headofstanos.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Honestly, considering the diffuclty of the Quest, I             don't think you'll be seeing too many High Elf Rogues and Bards             running around Norrath any time soon.&nbsp; Bards?&nbsp; Hahaha yes             Bards can wear the mask.&nbsp; Did I mention that the General             despawns after you complete the Quest?&nbsp; Have fun doing the             Ragebringer quest, Bards. . .</P>            <P align=left>Anyway, it was super cool of my guildmates to help out             with this quest.&nbsp; Essentially there was nothing in it for             them.&nbsp; It didn't benefit the guild in anyway.&nbsp; That's just             the type of friends we are I guess.&nbsp; Either that or when I             yelled, "HELP ME WITH THIS FUCKING MASK OR NO MORE PHAT LEWTZ FOR             YOU" had an impact on them.</P>            <P align=left>Like I said, we killed a ton of shit recently.&nbsp;             Late one night last week Kaelem spotted Ragefire up.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/ragefire.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Needless to say he was not up long.&nbsp; Congrats to             <STRONG>Kaelem</STRONG> on his res stick!</P>            <P align=left><STRONG>Metopious</STRONG> is also kicking ass on the             Coldain Ring Quest.&nbsp; He has everything to get Ring 9 now, he             just needs for the Dain not to be poofed *cough cough*.&nbsp; Oh ya,             I was helping with the quest and he hooked me up with this bow:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_7/adarrasbow.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Holy Jizm, Batman</STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Was very cool of him.&nbsp;
