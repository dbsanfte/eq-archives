I've been a cranky bitch lately.&nbsp; I promise I wont whine today.&nbsp; You all get the day off.</P><P align=left>The guild has been busting ass in Ssrae lately.&nbsp; I can't tell you how proud I've been of everyone's dedication to seeing these snakes die.&nbsp; We've been having fun mastering these guys as well, which afterall is the whole point of this shindig.&nbsp; So as far as the High Priest goes, we had one try the day Ssrae was a&nbsp;free for all -- we tried him with about 24 people and got fuggin destroyed.&nbsp; Then we had a bit of luck and got our key and tried him again with a full raid turnout.&nbsp; We lost that try as well but during that attempt we pretty much figured out what had to be done.&nbsp; That brings us to tonight which was pure ownage.&nbsp; I can't tell you how great it is to be surrounded by a bunch of these crazy mo faka's who just wanna see stuff dead.&nbsp; The whole server was popping tonight and we could have easily opted for the easy loot route.&nbsp; No one even mentioned it.&nbsp; Someone once asked me what it was like leading a guild like LoS.&nbsp; My answer is that it's like going to your garage every morning, opening it, and seeing a finely tuned Ferrari waiting. . .begging. . .&nbsp;to be driven like rocketship.&nbsp; A Ferrari with no rearview mirrors that is. . .</P><P align=left>So I was gonna be a cacksugger and not post any loot because, like I said, I've been a real cranky whore lately.&nbsp; But I ran out of beer and resorted to drinking the two liter bottle of Johnnie Walker Black that I had tucked away for a rainy day so I'll post loot.&nbsp; Luckily we've killed a bunch of shit the past few days so you wont know what dropped each item.&nbsp; Yeah, I like fuggin with people.&nbsp; Oh, and please, I realize that drinking scotch out of a two liter bottle is about as classy as a clip-on tie at a Shriners's Parade but do you think I give a shit?&nbsp; Like my favorite band of all time, Destiny's Child, so aptly put it, "I'ma survivor, I'm gonna make it!"&nbsp; Yeah, that makes no fucking sense -- send all complaints to the Johnnie Walker Black distillery. . .</P><P align=left>Ok here's the mystery loot. . .you'll never know what drops it till you get your lazy ass out of Velious and start killing shit on your own:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_6/greathelmoftruevision_loot.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_6/haloofenlighteningbarriers_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_6/righteousness_loot.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_6/shieldofholyvigor_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>So, my last update was done Feb. 5 and today is the 6. . .wait till you see how many fuggin Stalkers came by in that short time.&nbsp;

I know you crazy bastards want me to rant about this bullshit but do I even need to?&nbsp; I took some time to visit the "uber guild" sites from each server and on the vast majority of them you have people complaining about overcrowding and lack of spawns.&nbsp; This is the solution?&nbsp; Pay 4 times as much to get what we're paying for in the first place?&nbsp; So let me get this straight -- and please be patient with me, I am slow -- instead of dedicating time and money into coming up with a solution that would improve the gaming environment for EVERYONE serverwide, VI sinks its cash and resources into forming an exclusive server for those willing to pay 4 times what anyone should be paying in the first place?&nbsp; Ever wonder how much the guy got paid to rip-off Maeglo's design and make those websites or how long that took him?&nbsp; Wonder how much time and money that l33t map tracking thing cost.&nbsp; Wonder how many GM's are spending time creating dynamic content for those people.</P><P align=left>Perhaps the Legends server can just start selling loot and spawns.&nbsp; Want&nbsp;a shot at Vulak but he's always *camped*? -- $29.95!!!&nbsp; Special of the Month -- Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings -- Only $19.95!!! Buy now and we'll throw in a Blade of Carnage -- only we'll name it after you!</P><P align=left>The next time you're sitting in ToV with a bugged corpse stuck in a wall and waiting two hours for a GM to show up just picture those lucky bastards on the Legends server fighting Vulak in West Commons with 5 GM's watching them.</P><P align=left>Why fix problems and bugs when you can charge more money and ignore the mass population?</P><P align=left>My favorite part of this whole EQ Legends scam is the whole notion that now you're going to get to "Buy Fame in Everquest" -- ROFL.&nbsp; Um, ok.&nbsp; I know I'll just be clamoring at the EQ Legends website each day to figure out who my Hero is going to be!!! Nothing earns my respect more than some guy paying 4 times as much as me for a free shot at doing the things I have to work my ass off to do because VI simply doesn't give a shit about me, my server or the 30 others like it.</P><P align=left>I did like the part about the Legends losers getting all the new loot first.&nbsp; Thank fucking god.&nbsp; At least someone who is paying Verant a shitload of money might get them to realize that they have no concept of how loot works at the end game.&nbsp; I'm sick of bitching about what a bunch of bullshit the majority of SoL loot is.&nbsp; Anyone noticed that Rhags 1 and 2 drop better loot than the Arch Lich?&nbsp; Wait!! Not my problem anymore.&nbsp; Let some rich fucker kill the Arch Lich and he can bitch about the loot and get it upgraded!!! After all, it will have his name on it!!!</P><P align=left>Oh wait, I shouldn't bust on Legends too hard.&nbsp; I want everyone from The Nameless to move there.&nbsp; Yes, I love you guys and we're all such a great community but wouldn't you be better off on Legends?&nbsp; Come on, you know you would. . . By the way, don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.</P><P align=left>So welcome to the Era of Uber.&nbsp; Being Uber is no longer an elitist&nbsp;privilege you earn by being the best -- oh no.&nbsp; Get your AA skills, your serverfilter, your magic resist patch, your Safehouse spoilers, your EQ Legends and BAM -- isntant FAME.&nbsp; You are a GOD.&nbsp; We all worship you now.&nbsp; Welcome to Everquest where being Uber is not a right, it's a marketing scheme.</P><P align=left>And as a friendly reminder -- to all you moving to the Legends server -- please keep in mind:&nbsp; <STRONG>We're laughing AT you, not with you</STRONG>.<HR><P></P><P align=left>So us poor ghetto folk over on The Nameless have been busy killing mobs -- here's a sample of the carnage and loot:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_5/archlich_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_5/creator_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Here's some of the loot from these cacksuggin snakes:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_5/daggerofentrapment_loot.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_5/glowingmithrilulak_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_5/shieldofauras_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>I have some exclusive insider info I acquired for you all on the Batphone -- this loot will all have its name changed.&nbsp; Here are the new names you can expect to see next patch, thanks to EQ Legends:</P><P align=left><STRONG>Dagger of Some Rich Loser</STRONG></P><P align=left><STRONG>Some Rich Loser's Glowing Mithril Ulak</STRONG></P><P align=left><STRONG>Shield of Some Rich Loser</STRONG></P><P align=left>So there you have it.&nbsp; Excuse me if I sound jaded over this whole thing.&nbsp; I am jealous -- yes, I think that's it.&nbsp; You see, I refuse to pay $40 a month and it has hit me hard that I will never become famous in Everquest -- my life long goal.&nbsp; I am bound to live in obscurity, paying 10 bucks a month without people calling me names like l33t, ub9r, godlike or Mr. Oxlong Cock.&nbsp; Sigh. . .life sucks.</P><P align=left>Signing off with my head ducked down in shame because I will never be an EQ Legend,</P><P align=left>--The Notorious T.I.G.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>The Gnome of Own</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_5/gnome_of_own.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_5/gnome_of_own_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Blown Spawns of the Week on The Nameless</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left>AoW x2</P><P align=left>Glyphed Covered Serpent x2</P><P align=left>Exiled x2</P><P align=left>Cursed x2</P><P align=left>Ring War x1</P><P align=left>Number of Spawns blown by LoS = 0</P><P align=left>Working as Intended!!!
