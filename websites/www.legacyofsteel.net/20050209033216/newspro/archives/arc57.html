Was a fun night.&nbsp; First             stop was Icewell Keep to lay waste to <STRONG>Dain Cacksugger the             IV</STRONG>.&nbsp; He was the 425 Dorf tonight, again.&nbsp; The             fuggin noobs that plague Icewell are really getting old             though.&nbsp; We had two gimps trying to loot the Dain             tonight.&nbsp; Times like that I wish The Nameless was PvP.</P>            <P align=left>So as you can tell from the above picture, we also             ripped into Doz-e-queer the Cursed.&nbsp; I posted that pic so you             could spend hours analyzing our strats, only to flame us on our             boards. Actually the picture is faked.&nbsp; What we usually like to             do with Dozekar is train him to Lendinara the Keeper then make them             fight it out only to KS Lendinara at the last possible second!&nbsp;             We read it at the Safehouse so it we knew it MUST be true.&nbsp;             Well, strat aside, the important thing is ph4t l3tz right?&nbsp; Now             THIS is what you wanna see when you right-click on Ol' Dozey's             corpse:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/7tears.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Count 'em folks</STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Now to leave you all hanging. . .</P>            <P align=left>We DID complete some new quests tonight but I don't             have any pictures for you yet.&nbsp; <STRONG>Moca</STRONG> completed             the Test of the Long Battle Tonight.&nbsp; Resulted in some boots --             AC 25 +10 Wis Sta +50 Mana +3 all saves Effect: Aura of Battle --             Wis caster only.</P>            <P align=left>Also, next time I update this page I'll post the             results of the FOUR tear quest too -- the Request of the             Strong.&nbsp; Leick's currently got all the tears for it sitting in             his inventory, logged out in ToV.&nbsp; Of course the goal is to             complete all of these ToV quests but with Doze on a one week spawn             (not to mention the&nbsp;named drakes) it's gonna take us some             time.</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalker's, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/arlosea.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/lieck.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/tigolestoilet.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/tigzbung.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the             Day</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/adorean.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_4/barn_quote.jpg"             border=0></P></font><a name="newsitem991033200,18145,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Wasting Away In Margaritaville</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Monday, May 28, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>   <P align=center><FONT size=4><STRONG>The Swarthiest of             Sl00ts</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_27/jangos.jpg"             width=500 border=0></P>            <P align=center>"Jangos" -- Art by <STRONG>Thatia</STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Hail Lovers, Freaks, Sl00ts, Wanna-be's, EQ junkies,             Foolmans, Friends and Lovers of HLS!</P>            <P align=left>Well, I am still on vacation but this fuggin web site             was in dire need of an update.&nbsp; Unfortunately for all of you, I             have no graphics programs on this shit-ass laptop so that picture             will probably take you a good ten minutes to download unless you're             sitting at NASA or some shit.&nbsp; Frankly, I could give a rat's             ass how long it takes you -- just be patient it's worth the             wait.&nbsp; Thatia once again proves that not only is she the Queen             of HLS, she is also an amazingly talented artist.</P>            <P align=left>So it's overcast as a mo faka today.&nbsp; I've been             baking in the sun for so many days in a row now that it's nice to be             chilling inside for once.&nbsp; Hell, it's 11:30 in the morning, I'm             drinking Corona's and watching the Lakers own the Spurs             (again).&nbsp; How bad can life really be?</P>            <P align=left>Oh wait, I forgot, no one actually gives a shit what I             am doing since I am not out raping and pillaging with the asskicking             machine known as Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; I spoke with Rhap on the             phone the other night and he filled me in on what the guild has been             up to.&nbsp; It seems that since I've been out of town Dozekar,             Tormax, Zland, Kland, CT and numerous other deserving-to-die beasts             have been catapulted to their deaths.&nbsp; Actually, there is even             new loot to report.&nbsp; Tormax dropped some KICK ASS gloves --             28ac +6 dex/str/sta +75 HP. . .Of course, Rhap being a lazy drunken             son of a sl00t cacksugger didn't bother posting a screenshot of them             or emailing one to me, so you'll just have to take my word for             it.</P>            <P align=left>So I know Doze had died a few times since I've been             gone but I have no clue what he dropped or if any new quests have             been completed.&nbsp; I do know that he did drop one more of the             tears toward the four tear quest Leick is working on.&nbsp; We're             all pretty excited to see just what four tears from old Doze-slacker             aka Doz-e-queer the Cursed can buy.&nbsp; Oooooh, and speaking of             Leick, many congrats to my homeboy on getting his Dain Ring.</P>            <P align=left>Enough rambling for me.&nbsp; There are beers to be             drank.&nbsp; If these clouds clear up I've got to deal with the             monumental task of moving my lazy ass 100 yards to the beach.&nbsp;             I'll be back in business next weekend at which time you can prepare             yourself for the ONSLAUGHT of dead mobs this page will be littered             with.&nbsp; In the meantime, the mobs will have to keep on dying             with no press coverage.&nbsp; I think you'll survive.</P>            <P align=left>Signing off from the land of the Chi Chi,</P>            <P align=left>--Tigole     Bitties</P></font><a name="newsitem990169200,66246,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Like A Breeze Through The Trees You Can Watch Me Blow</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Friday, May 18, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>     <P align=center><FONT size=4><STRONG>Congrats             Metopious!</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>The First Ring 10 on The             Nameless</STRONG></P>            <P align=center><STRONG></STRONG><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/may/5_18/metop.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Kind of funny, just last night we were beating the             stuffing outta that Gimp Dorf known as Dain Frostreaver yet today             we're winning wars for the little bastard.&nbsp; That's right, we             did the Ring 10 war with 90% of the guild KoS.&nbsp; It was             insane.&nbsp; Tons of fun.&nbsp; Mostly Chaos.&nbsp; This quest is             simply one of the *BEST* encounters out there.&nbsp;
