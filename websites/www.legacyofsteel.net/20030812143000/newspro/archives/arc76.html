We managed to kill             (in no particular order) <STRONG>Velketor, Lord Djindespiesuxacack,             Nagafen, Vox, Zordak Ragefire, Gorenaire, Talendor, Severilous,             Trakanon, Venril Sathir, Bazzt Zzzt, Sister of Spire, Spiroc Lord,             Overking of Chardok, Queen of Chardok, Innoruuk, Maestro, Cazic             Thule, Master Yael, Faydedar,&nbsp;Silverwing, Hoshkar, Xygoz,             Druushk, Nexona,</STRONG> and <STRONG>Phara Dar.</STRONG>&nbsp; All             server firsts.&nbsp; <STRONG>Bazzt Zzzt</STRONG> and             <STRONG>Overseer</STRONG> of Air were EQ firsts.&nbsp; Our clearing             of Veeshan's Peak was an EQ third.&nbsp; In the Epic Weapon             department, we managed to secure the first rogue, warrior, ranger,             druid, cleric, enchanter, necro, shaman, bard, and pally Epics on             <STRONG>The Nameless</STRONG>.&nbsp; We also tried the mighty shaman             of Misty Thicket, <STRONG>Mooto</STRONG>, numerous times but alas             the evil goblin defeated our forces with every attempt.&nbsp; We'll             get him this year though.</P>            <P align=left>So on to the most current of events.&nbsp; Let's             see.&nbsp; Thanks to a whopping cold I managed to miss my New Years             Party.&nbsp; Yesterday, I woke up in the morning, felt like I was             dying, and just laid there till one in the afternoon.&nbsp;             Eventually, the dog got me out of bed and dragged me downstairs for             a walk.&nbsp; Then I remembered the nightmare that is Pasadena on             New Years Eve.&nbsp; First guy I run into is taking a piss right on             my street.&nbsp; Doesn't he know that pissing on my street in a             drunken stupor is a right reserved for me and my friends only?&nbsp;             Anyway, I started to feel pretty bummed out becauae it was glaringly             apparent that there was no way in hell I was going to make it to             some New Years party as sick as I was.&nbsp; I constantly hear             people criticize Everquest.&nbsp; My friend calls it, "That Dopey             Game".&nbsp; But the truth is thanks to EQ last night I actually got             to "hang" with some people on New Years rather than just lying in             bed, or staring at the garbage some fools watch on television.&nbsp;             We threw together a last minute <STRONG>Plane of Growth</STRONG>             raid.&nbsp; I think we had about 15 people.&nbsp; It was a blast.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_1/joboba.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Just when you thought <STRONG>Joboba</STRONG>             couldn't look any worse. . .</P>            <P align=left><STRONG>Joboba</STRONG> got new arms and boots.&nbsp;             <STRONG>Iaminae</STRONG> picked up some new sleeves she desperately             needed.&nbsp; <STRONG>Parv</STRONG> got a new helm (grats             SSB).&nbsp; And <STRONG>Sumak</STRONG> got some Silver Moon             slippers.&nbsp; The menory of <STRONG>Saldor</STRONG> lives on. .             .</P>            <P align=left>The day before was pretty fun too.&nbsp; We had             planned to kill the <STRONG>Dain</STRONG>.&nbsp; All I can say is we             rid Icewell Keep of that Dorf bastard.&nbsp; But. . . .alas. . .we             didn't kill he.&nbsp; Somehow, somewhere the Dain poofed.&nbsp; No,             he did not go behind his curtain.&nbsp; No, he did not get stuck in             a stairwell.&nbsp; The Dain Poofed.&nbsp; As in, No Dain for             us.&nbsp; Quite frankly, it may have been in our best interest that             the Dain poofed because we only had about 20 people there.&nbsp; But             we're anxious to fight him anyway. . .every battle, win or loss, is             a learning experience.&nbsp; We did kill <STRONG>Sensechal</STRONG>,             not that it matters.&nbsp; He dropped some shield.&nbsp; Grats EC             Tunnel~</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_1/shieldoftheseneschal.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Earlier that same day we killed Fool Turtle in             Iceclad.&nbsp;

City of Mist is an odd             zone.&nbsp; I think it is truly one of the best looking dungeons in             Kunark.&nbsp; Just a shame there's no reason to go there.&nbsp; It             suffers from Chardok-itis.</P>            <P align=left>Next stop was everyone's favorite zone, <STRONG>THE             HOLE</STRONG>.&nbsp;
