            <P align=left><STRONG>Welcome to LegacyOfSteel.Com, Where Our Goal 
            is to Weed Out All You Slow-Ass 28.8 Modem Users by Using Too Many 
            Large Images at High Resolution</STRONG>. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            <HR>

            <P></P>
            <P align=left>Let's be honest.&nbsp; No one wants to group with you 
            and your shitty modem anyway.&nbsp; You're probably that cleric who 
            goes LD every 5 minutes while the rest of us die while you stare at 
            "You have been disconnected", AGAIN.&nbsp; Get a new modem you lazy 
            bitch.&nbsp; This is the twenty-first century.&nbsp; Sure, blame it 
            on Tigole's updates. . .too many images, too high of 
            resolution.&nbsp; I think I'm doing the EverQuest community a favor 
            by making all you slow-as-molasses people realize it's time to save 
            up that extra bit of scratch, get off your lazy rear and get a new 
            goddamn connection.&nbsp; Ah, nothing like some Sunday morning 
            bitching and moaning to make me feel better.&nbsp; And by the way, 
            anytime you feel that our site is too slow, just take a quick jaunt 
            over to FoH's site, noows or whatever.&nbsp; For the love of god, I 
            think they're running that site on a Commdore 64 with a 14.4 
            connection.&nbsp; I once tried to post over there but it took me two 
            hours to register so I gave up.&nbsp; Must be all the phat graphics 
            and screenshots that slow that site down. . .</P>
            <P align=left>Wow, if I haven't managed to piss you off by now, 
            what's wrong with you?&nbsp; Let's talk about the main problem, 
            instead of me randomly bashing suck-ass modem users and instead of 
            my uneeded troll at our good friends over at FoH. . .Ok, I'm willing 
            to admit it:&nbsp; The problem is me.&nbsp; I basically have no phat 
            HTML skeeelz. . . .in fact, I basically have no HTML skeeelz 
            period.&nbsp; I use some free program I downloaded to do my 
            updates.&nbsp; I don't look at the code ever -- I am in constant, 
            Retard-Design Mode.&nbsp; The other day I accidently deleted the 
            Insert Image button.&nbsp; I sat there for something like 30 minutes 
            trying to find where the button went.&nbsp; Briefly, I considered 
            never including another image on the site again.&nbsp; But being the 
            l33t hax0r I am, I finally managed to figure things out.&nbsp; Have 
            no fear in your LoS newswriter, but please, do have patience. . 
            .("patients").</P>
            <P align=left>Ok, time for Tigole the Silent to live up to his name. 
            . .here's some dead shit:</P>

            <P align=left>We killed <STRONG>Trakanon</STRONG> yesterday 
            afternoon.&nbsp; Was weird, I think Trak had gained a few 
            levels.&nbsp; He must have been grinding exp or something over the 
            past week.&nbsp; Anyway, he went down fast and dropped some decent 
            loot (if you're the LoS bank account that is).&nbsp; <STRONG>Parv's 
            roomate</STRONG> ninja looted a <STRONG>Singing Steel 
            breastplate</STRONG> before going LD and the other drop was a 
            <STRONG>Mrylokar Breastplate</STRONG>.&nbsp; Grats bank!&nbsp; and 
            Grats Bank!&nbsp; Contact <STRONG>Polonious</STRONG> if you wanna 
            offer us a phat trade for either of these items (no your Fungal 
            Tunic doesn't count as a phat trade).</P>
