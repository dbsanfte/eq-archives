We absolutely             ripped through Sleepers.&nbsp; Our goal was to find the elusive mob             called <STRONG>Z-Axis</STRONG>. . .we needed to try Dictate on him,             lifetap for slow.&nbsp; We all had our Res Effects buffs in place             but Z-Axis never spawned.&nbsp; Instead, we decided to destroy the             Warders of Sleepers Tomb.&nbsp; This was our first chance actually             seeing them up.&nbsp; Previously we had a bunch of !placeholders to             contend with.&nbsp; </P>            <P align=left>So we kill the Final Arbitor and we were sitting             around buffing up for our next fight.&nbsp; Leick and I both notice             that flying gargoyle that roams between the Warders so Leick tells             me, "Grab it, Tig."&nbsp; Being the fantastic noobie moron I am (you             really need to get to know me to appreciate just what a n00b I can             be) I shoot my l33t Adarra's Bow at him.&nbsp; Of course, rather             than the Garg turning and coming to attack me, he takes off in the             other direction toward Nanzata the Warder.&nbsp; Cue Dueling Banjos             as the Halfling goes down.&nbsp; So that's how we decided which             Warder to kill first.&nbsp; That prick cacksugging mo faka beeotch             Nanzata had to die.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_7/nanzata_dead.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG><EM>Always fun killing a mob on your first             attempt. . .</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left>The next Warder looked like Silverwing so we just knew             he had to be a big phat poosae.&nbsp; His name was Tukaarak or             something like that.&nbsp; Ol' Tupac died on the first try as             well:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_7/gnomes!.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG><EM>The Gnomes of LoS. . .so many             deathtouches, so little time. . .</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left>The last warder we took down was             <STRONG>Hraashna</STRONG>.&nbsp; Hraashna absolutely destroyed us on             our first attempt.&nbsp; We had very little knowledge as to what             sort of strat to use against him.&nbsp; We just kinda saw the dude             and went for it.&nbsp; Needless to say we learned a lot.&nbsp; What             happened next was pure magic.&nbsp; Keep in mind we had 26 people in             Sleepers.&nbsp; We ressed up, came up with a kick-ass strat and beat             Hraashna in what, if I dare say, might have been one of our crowning             moments.&nbsp; With 26 people this was not a matter of "Press A" and             hope for the best.&nbsp; Every single person in there was on the             exact same page.&nbsp; He might not be the toughest mob in EQ but             with the raid force we had it was a fantastic challenge and an even             greater victory.</P>            <P align=left>Ok. . .yea, yea, yea, Tig, shut the fuck up,             right?&nbsp;

To those who said             things like, "Why don't you just switch" I'd like to offer this             class in Reading Comprehension:</P>            <P align=left>I quote myself:&nbsp; <STRONG><EM>All of what I have             to say is null and void if you disregard the notion of             balance.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left>I love those suggestions, "Just switch."&nbsp; No             fucking shit, sherlock.&nbsp; Like we're not on the verge of doing             just that.&nbsp; What I was attempting to do was have those "in             power" re-evaluate the factions in this game so that perhaps the             game OVERALL would be better for EVERYONE.&nbsp; Tough concept for             some.</P>            <P align=left>Ok, not in the mood to rant tonight.&nbsp; Had a nice             relaxing 4th of July on the beach.&nbsp; Although someone please             explain why the water in California is friggin 40 degrees, not to             mention that disturbing brown hue.&nbsp; I guess none of this             matters here on an Everquest webpage.&nbsp; We only care about ph4t             l3wtz right?&nbsp; Ok here's some ph4t l3wtz for you all to             peruse:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/silvermaskoftheslayer.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Request of the Strong Completed!</P>            <P align=left>Yes, finally the "broken quest" is unbroken.&nbsp;             Thanks to Vald for giving us the head's up that the quest had             finally been fixed.&nbsp; Mask is pretty nice.&nbsp; Not so nice             when you think about the fact that it requires 4 tears and Doze only             drops 2-3 tears now.&nbsp; Nothing like taking 30+ people two weeks             minimum to get one person a mask.</P>            <P align=left>Anyway, I'm proud to say LoS was the first to complete             the majority of Dozekar quests.&nbsp; For a short while we were             actually proud that we stuck to our faction path.&nbsp; Someone had             to discover this shit right?&nbsp; Well, there are only a few more             challenges left for us within our reach on this faction.&nbsp;             Unless something changes drastically soon, it's not hard to figure             out what we'll be gunning for next.&nbsp; Farming l3wtz just doesn't             get my nipples hard.</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Gage, The Uber             Banker</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/gage_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Welcome to the Drunken World of             Rhap</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/rhap_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/rhap_quote2.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/frigole.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/stigolestalker.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/tigolesbalszack.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/twgole.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the             Day</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/parv_quote.jpg"             border=0></P></font>
