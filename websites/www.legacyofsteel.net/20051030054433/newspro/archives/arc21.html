Jesus Lord, seriously, fug you guys down in San Diego - I hate Ssra and I hate the Emp.  Requiring 70+ people to camp the keys, at an EXTREMELY generous 2 hours per part, takes 18+ *days* of our time.  I will not even go into the shards - you can take those sticks and shove them up your asses - the only fun part is training the zone after you get your frame and a zone disruption warning really is the cherry on top of that shit sunday.  TEE HEE!!!!!<p>What's even better is that while killing the Emp takes 70+, VT is done with ~40 - and you're surprised so many guilds sacked half their members after getting power sources?  Maybe you guys are blissfully unaware of how painful having 70 reasonably intelligent, funny, witty and engaging people clustered together at once becomes, but after 2 weeks of it non stop with the cross section of EQ, I've become some what of an expert on single digit frame rates and IQ's - oh yah, and drama.  So whatever, we'll kill the Emp and sack VT eventually but <strong>WarCraft III</strong> is out today - big congrats to the LoS Storm Reavers - go support a commitment to quality games (hint to VI: this involves play testing, you cacks) and buy it.<p>Oh you thought I was done?  Not even close, Bud.  To add insult to injury, I was finally forced to get broadband.  I'd resisted the urge for a long time - I mean why?  I have a connection at work most people can only dream about and when I get home there's really not that much sufficiently interesting on the net which requires a high speed connection.  I was HAPPY with my modem, hot dammit, but with SoL all that changed, and I blame - besides 70+ raids - <strong>AE SONGS AND SERVER FILTERS NOT WORKING PROPERLY</strong>.  I guess when you've got no bard testers and 0 bard GM's you're probably not at fault - I mean, testing something as obscure as one of the class defining features is expecting a bit much.  So yay - I can now do Emp without going LD or lagging 3-4 *minutes* in the past.  Leet.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/tig-vt_quote.gif"></center><p>Before I wrap up, I'd like to pay tribute to one of the more influential people in my life who pasted away Friday, June 28, 2002 - <strong>Henry "The Bull" Del Toro</strong>.  As telling and fugged up as it may be, The Bull wasn't a scientist, humanitarian or astronaut, nothing like that in fact - he was a morning radio shock jock before the name was coined and the genre trite - and someone who had the unprecedented access to both my ears and my attention in my formative years.  Brief snippets on the way to school or those dog days, like Scout's smartly starched collars damp by 9, of summer break listening all morning outside under the muggy umbra of a threatening humidity before the real heat set in, it didn't matter - I was held rapt.  The sheer infectious nature of his laugh would make any stunt or bit funny and his heart was always in the right place - he loved what he did and was keenly aware of his impact, though modesty prevailed in his later interviews regarding such, but his real talent was recognizing and reveling in the uncomfortable and awkward moments of life, stretching them beyond what would be the polite decorum of escape, always eschewing tact and even, at times, humane mercy for those found caught and cornered to experience such in the fullest - that propensity to hold unflinching and bear witness to one of the great human event horizons is the most memorable and meaningful bit I thankfully have taken away from it all.  R.I.P. Bull.<p>In between coffins, drama and my bitching, we killed a bunch of stuff, so have a gander.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/creator-fight.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/arlos_quote.gif"><p><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/creator-dead.jpg"><p><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_02/sont.jpg"><br>Speculum, pls.</center><p>God knows the fun killing Cursed is, yes?

I've been really proud of the way the guild perseveres through what have been some long and at times humbling loses while we're in the midst of transition and the attendant learning curve.  Blame it all on Trak, but despite killing that bitch non-stop for months in RoK, we got the shaft and shitloads of SK BPs that still molder in the bank.  LoS never had a Donal's Army - we had *1* BP in fact - and thus all the successes of the past are all the more impressive when you consider it was due to simply amazing clerics, not counting to 5 and mashing a hotkey.  I suppose we could warm up on CH rotation with AoW, but we're not much on going 11 months in reverse.  While the Emp isn't dead yet, the sorry sumbitch is close.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/emp_quote.gif"></center><p>Most guilds would call it a night at blood/emp/coffins... yah right - no GoP.  On general principles alone (well, okay - and greed), if it spawned in Ssra, we were all over it like a gnat on a dog's dick.  Here's what it looked like when we actually killed the stuff - watching it on SEQ from the zone line must get boring.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/al.jpg"></center><p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/hp.jpg"></center><p>Hahaha, this was where the comedy started - somehow mobs got loose and NO ONE got on the CH adds - HP went from <span style="background-color:darkred"><font color=white>Hi</font></span> to <span style="background-color:darkred"><font color=white>High Prie</font></span> as people just stood around waiting for phat loot to fall from the sky or whatever else they do when severe retardation sets in with all the get up and go of constipation.  With the cries of 'burn him down!' and 'MOTHERFUCKER!', we somehow pulled out a win, and then started to handle the mess - minus the people who stood around clicking on the corpse (on a personal note, IF YOU TYPE SLOW OR READ ON THE THIRD GRADE LEVEL GET OFF THE CORPSE.  K.  THX.) or were confused by the enigmatic 'kill the adds!!!!!'<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/hp2.jpg"></center><p>It all ended well though, and while I'm bitching now, at the time all I could do laugh (and cuss) at the spectacle of it all... cause.... you know, it was a textbook kill - you guys on SEQ, do exactly what we did - please.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/shroud_loot.jpg"></center><p>We got some new loot and followed up with the basement, but I forgot take pictures - here's the result, your usual dead snake with what looks like an extreme close up of a human vagina for the mouth... pussies.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/dead-snake.jpg"></center><p>So much to rant about, and don't worry, you'll hear about it soon, but I'm off - logging in with res effects again, 1 blue left in 60 and rarin' to go.

You know, the same ones that said we were finished when Draed retired, or was it when Tenaj left?  Maybe Ariel?  Oh yah, now it's Tig.  Thankfully, that's just not how things work around here: HGS, yes - drama, oh God yes - but GoP, never.  After careful consideration and whatever else those elitist aholes do on the Officers' board, <strong>Henric Maelstrom</strong>, hero of the Halas bath house, has accepted the reigns and is now LoS's new GM, the boss, and the one you should send tells to complain about Jangos (and Korelor, and China, always fucking China, and... well you get the idea, Henric is going to be a busy man - but between you and me, don't fall for his 'fake AFK' trick).<p>Anyhow, days of limbo spent shard camping and killing pissant mobs awaiting the white smoke wax tedious and frustrating, but tonight as the first order of business, Henric set about feeding the Beast with the only thing imaginable: momentum.   After Andalier's stunning halftime speech, the Evil Empire tore out of the locker room and simply destroyed HP, the basement and Blood in the best executed kills to date - I'd say perfect, but Amulek mod rod'd himself to death... so actually, jeje, perfect.~ <p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/henric-hp.jpg"></center><p>Along with the usual stuff, we got some new caster pants out of the basement, but I sort of tuned out the details in my disappointment - let's all hope for yet more mediocre weapons next time and not junk up the loot tables with ancient spells or other useful drops.<p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/pants_loot.jpg"></center><p>No, the Emp isn't down quite yet, but the Evil Empire is back with a burning fire like when I pee and that smell of diesel fuel in the air isn't from one of Crazz's truck stop bathroom encounters, it's a big fucking steamroller - I hope Nameless enjoyed this small respite, but we want our 2 dollars.<p>In closing, we're all grateful for the tremendous amount of work Tigole put in to the guild, and while we can't give him the same farewell he honored Draed with,<p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/for-draed-vahn.jpg"></center><p>he's easy to please:<br><br><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/tig_quote.gif"><p>Some hang on to used to be, live their life looking behind.  All we have is here and now, all our lives out there to find; the road is long and there are mountains in my way, but we climb the stairs everyday.  Love lift us up where we belong - where the eagles fly on a mountain high.  Love lift us up where we belong, far from the world below, where the clear winds blow.

If the tells I receive each night are any indication, I'm guessing Kinsey's off a good 50%.  Actually, I enjoy talking with you random people - some of the most memorable moments in the game have taken place in those late night sessions of EQ.  If Dave Attel needs a correspondent, let me know - though to be honest, it's closer to Fear and Loathing in Norrath after hours.  It's a tough call to keep this section as I run the risk of qualifying myself, but on the other hand, with the new *floating* GM's, the potential random acts of stupidity are pretty tempting.<p>Comments?<p><FONT size=4><STRONG>Quote of the Day</STRONG></FONT><p><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/anda_quote.gif"><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body>
