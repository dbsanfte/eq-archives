Her setting out in life, like the rising of a fair morning, was unclouded and promising.

No other nation was founded with a charter to preserve these ideals, with underpinnings and tenets in sanguine etchings across more than 200 years, dedicated to preserving our right to disagree - for that, America and Americans are hated most in the world, that we promote unchecked thought and expression and thereby threaten the milked facade of crushed knowledge.<p>I, personally, could not be more proud to be hated so much - principle, integrity and honor are tangible, their cost exorbitant, but their meaning priceless, and yet endure only so long as I live up those ideals - this path is not for everyone, but perhaps the greatest tribute to 9/11 is to <strong>live your life today and revel in it</strong>.<p>It would be wrong to consider this just another day, regular update tomorrow.</font></body><a name="newsitem1031430046,65898,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Kick 'em When They're Up Kick 'em When They're Down</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Saturday, September 7, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork@legacyofsteel.net">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>Empfest 2002!</strong></font></center><p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.<p>For true, Chuck, and the Evil Empire works the same way - take, for example, <strong>Empfest 2002</strong> with 3 Emp runs (thx patch) - we either owned in a flawless under 23 min kill with 68 or we absolutely sucked cock and beg for more with 70 in a 43 minute fight were we legitimately lost 5 times, winning on due to some real heads up play at critical moments and rod teams of own.

I hear really good changes took place, but I fake LD when the guild starts to move so I couldn't really say - CoH still works but autojoin is a son of a bitch when you're trying to hide on a mule until the clearing is done.  Good first step to itemize Eom's, though the very best suggestion I read on the boards was to have random AA point capsules - a terrific incentive to actually *do* the content since many raid guilds find it taxing - which leads to burn out - to grind xp for AA's, keep 60, raid and yet still have a life.  The drop rate needn't be high, maybe 20%; you kill ~20 Eom's in a long night and 4 people get an AA point - seems fair to me.<p>This actually brings up another point - what happened to raid xp?  Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems a clean and easy fix: set a toggle for chat channels: raid<p><font color=white>;raid evil-empire<p>Evil-Empire is now a raid channel.</font><p>And if you're in the same raid channel as the person credited with the kill and within, say, 200% of the normal xp radial distance from the kill, then you get a portion of the xp - just turn off raid when you're done and regular xp rules take over.  Sure, I'm glossing over the details like checking to make sure a solo wizard doesn't tag along and KS the raid channel for mammoth xp, rebalancing xp off boss mobs, super-groups, &c., but that's what testing and caffeine are for~<p><font size=4><strong>Working As Intended</strong></font><p><strong>Exclusive</strong> to LoS, our team of mad hackers (gr33tz to sh4wn) have uncovered some PoP loot and we're going to be the first to break it anywhere!<p><strong>Warning</strong> - spoilers ahead!<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/pop-voro_quote.png><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/pop_loot.png><p></center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/wrong-cronto-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/wrong-cronto_quote.png><p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/desp-warder-v-warder.jpg><br>And you fuckers thought bugged warders were only good for rampage</center><p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-buy-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-fore_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-lan_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-monq_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-pork_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-racel_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-spank_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-ssra_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-sy_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-vantic_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-zaxis_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/s-zed_quote.png><p><font size=3>When Stalking Goes Wrong...</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/wrong-jaytee_quote.png><p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-ant_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-azlana_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/berton_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-desp_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-dregor_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-gullem2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-gullem_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-henric_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-jangos-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-jangos_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-kaemon_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-lan-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-lan-3_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-lan-4_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-lan_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-line_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-polo_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-rhap-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-rhap_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/thisle_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september_02/9_07/q-voro_quote.png><p><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body>
