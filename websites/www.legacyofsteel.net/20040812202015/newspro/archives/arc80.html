I'm             starting to get sick so I've been resting, taking it easy. .             .getting a soar throat.&nbsp; Now I know how Despie feels             everday.&nbsp; Yesterday was a good day for the guild.&nbsp; We             added a new member, the lovely Ms. <STRONG>Cyni             Barhopper</STRONG>.&nbsp; Not only does Cyni have mad skeelz, she is             a damage dealing machine AND she makes you all wish you were a rogue             too so you'd get the excellent view I get every night, backstabbing             with her:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_29/cyni.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>jeje</P>            <P align=left>As we wait for the return of many of our friends,             we've been trying to help people finish their Epic Quests.&nbsp;             First stop last night was <STRONG>City of Mist</STRONG>.&nbsp; We             killed <STRONG>Lord Rak'Rastaman</STRONG> or whatever so that the             great Barbarian King (according to some), <STRONG>Valmoon</STRONG>,             could proudly wield his Epic Weap.&nbsp; City of Mist is an odd             zone.&nbsp; I think it is truly one of the best looking dungeons in             Kunark.&nbsp; Just a shame there's no reason to go there.&nbsp; It             suffers from Chardok-itis.</P>            <P align=left>Next stop was everyone's favorite zone, <STRONG>THE             HOLE</STRONG>.&nbsp; Oh how we love the HOLE.&nbsp; If god existed,             then the HOLE would be heaven.&nbsp; Monkeys could fly.&nbsp; Desp             would not suck.&nbsp; Well, actually, for all my bitching and             whining about the Hole, yesterdays' journey there was pretty             harmless.&nbsp; We managed to scrounge up <STRONG>Poly's</STRONG>             mob so he is one step closer to getting his phatty spear.&nbsp;             While down there I sent Ariel a tell, "Hey, you want me to check if             Yael is up?"&nbsp; Ariel replies, "Sure.&nbsp; Just don't die."</P>            <P align=left>Master Yael shouts, "TIGOLE!"</P>            <P align=left>Tigole tells the guild, " Erm Yael up."</P>            <P align=left>Guild replies, "Um, no shit."</P>            <P align=left>If there is any mob more visually stunning then Master             Yael, it would have to be the HUGE Water Elemental in L Guk:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_29/masteryael.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Luckily the big brown mo faka dropped some nice             lewts:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_29/loamrobe.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_29/llodllod.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Llod Llod</STRONG>: Ghetto Pimp of the FBR             Deluxe</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_29/brellsgirdle.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Meggan's</STRONG> new belt. . .</P>            <P align=left>Well, I know I am going to break all your hearts when             I tell you this, but I'm going to be gone tonight.&nbsp; You all             know what that means, probably no update tomorrow unless someone             gets me some infoz for me.&nbsp; I'm feeling sick as hell but a             friend is having a shindig and it will be my last chance to see many             of my homies before they leave town.&nbsp;

We're still entering the Donal's             Breastplate Lotto every chance we get (nerf be damned) but we're             having about as much success as a man trying to get a date with a             professional female golfer.&nbsp; Today's Trak run was not fun and I             blame myself.&nbsp; Last time I was the guy who went and agro'd the             dragon not once, but twice before the charge.&nbsp; If there's             anything the guild loves, it's when I agro the dragon and they all             get to sit an extra 30 minutes, cursing fool-rogue under their             breath.&nbsp; Unfortunately everything went smooth as silk and we             only got to spend minimal time in everyone's favorite dungeon, Guk             Senior.&nbsp; <STRONG>Trakanon</STRONG> dropped two manna robes             which were awarded to <STRONG>Medicd</STRONG> and             <STRONG>Necrath</STRONG>.&nbsp; Another notable thing about this             Trakanon raid was that we figured out, finally, how to kill the             dragon without having a single bard die.</P>            <P align=left>We also found time to whack a fair number of Epic             Quest mobs as well as a host of giants.&nbsp; Random phat lewts of             the day include two 20/30 bows for our rangers, a Fungal Staff for             Mudcrush, a nice new cloak for Brionca, and a Torn Silk Robe for             Llod's SoV armor quest.</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-Be's, and             Unoriginal Bastards of the Day:</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_28/genjiru.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_28/tigollesuxphaty.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the             Day:</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_28/khagan_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P   align=center></font><a name="newsitem977904000,59917,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Do You Mind If We Dance With Your Dates?</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Wednesday, December 27, 2000&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P> <P align=left><STRONG>Question</STRONG>: What do you do if your             Merry Band of Whoopass has a bunch of MIA clerics over the Holiday             season? </P>            <P align=left><STRONG>Answer</STRONG>:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_27/vs_dead_12_27.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Venril, king of the poosae lizards. . .dead             again.</P>            <P align=left>I'm not sure what everyone's up to but I keep             expecting tumble weeds to blow through whatever zone I am in.&nbsp;             Looking forward to everyone returning from their holiday travels so             that some real&nbsp;beat down&nbsp;can take place.&nbsp; We still             owe a few giants&nbsp;a piece of what-for, an LoS style             vendetta.&nbsp; Some Dorfs come to mind to that are just begging to             be spanked (sigh, not Desp. . .Nameless isn't PvP or we'd be all             over that).&nbsp; So to quench some our thirst for keeeling tonight             we threw together a quick Venril raid.&nbsp; Was fun, we dropped him             with 17. . .only 3 wizards. . .no deaths of course.&nbsp; Drops were             extremely good. . .if you're the LoS bank that is.&nbsp; Elder             Spiratualists Greaves and a Necro Staff.&nbsp;

Mine was             excellent although I am excited for the return of my guildmates and             welcome the end of this Fa La La business.&nbsp; I'm guessing we             won't be back to full speed until after the New Year.&nbsp; Speaking             of New Year's. . .I might miss my New Year's Eve party because I             can't find a goddamn kennel for the dog for the night.&nbsp; The             real problem is those assholes -- the Tournament of Roses.&nbsp;             Those rat-bastards throw a big-ass parade three blocks from where I             live every year.&nbsp; Getting in and out of Pasadena on New Years             is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.&nbsp; So if I go to this             party, the dog needs to be looked after. . . SIGH. . .does anyone             actually watch the parade anyway?&nbsp; I mean, it's kind of             disturbing if you think they just load a bunch of dead foliage on a             truck and millions of people line the streets to look at the             garbage.&nbsp; Go Away Parade.&nbsp; Ah there was a point to all             this.&nbsp; If you see me online on New Year's Eve, I am in a shitty             mood -- don't talk to me cause I am stuck sitting behind a computer             while all my friends are celebrating as my dog lies un-kenneled at             my feet because the goddamn Tournament of Roses runs their mo faka             parade three blocks from my front door and every shlepper in America             has to show up to watch the dying flowers inch down Colorado             Boulevard at 5 miles per hour.</P>            <P align=left>Did I mention I cannot wait for this season to be             over?</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Gnome Anecdote of the             Day:</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_27/gnome.jpg"             border=0></FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards of the Day:</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Our first Arlos imposter!</P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_27/arlus.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_27/tigfortrue.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_27/tigolebigbird.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_27/tigolle.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the             Day:</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_27/ozus_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P   align=center></font>
