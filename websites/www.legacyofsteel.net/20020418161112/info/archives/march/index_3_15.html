            <HR>

            <P></P>
            <P align=left>I figured if John Travolta's career could do it, so 
            could I.&nbsp; That's right -- come back.&nbsp; The truth is, I 
            heard melee can now bind in Field of Bone and I almost blinded 
            myself by the massive erection shooting through my trousers at the 
            very thought.&nbsp; How could I resist not coming back?&nbsp; Well, 
            all sarcasm aside, I am playing Everquest again.&nbsp; I appreciated 
            all the kind things people said when I left.&nbsp; I also enjoyed 
            the speculation over why I left (nerfs etc.).&nbsp; Truth is, I was 
            massively burned out.&nbsp; As much as I love this game, leading a 
            guild is a ton of work.&nbsp; Luckily we have a new leader now, 
            Oogtuug. Oogtuug is the famous Draed Vahn, the original GM of LoS, 
            our founder.&nbsp; The best part about Oogtuug taking over is now I 
            can bitch and moan everytime I don't get loot.&nbsp; I also plan on 
            bitching and moaning any time he schedules an event that takes place 
            in a zone where I don't need loot.&nbsp; I think I'll bitch and moan 
            if I have to wait around too long for something too.&nbsp; If we 
            lose to some mob, it will of course be Oogtuug's fault.&nbsp; 
            Mostly, now that I am not GM, I have to dedicate most of my time to 
            figuring out how to best bitch and moan to Oogtuug.</P>
            <P align=left>So I gotta say, leaving Everquest was entirely 
            overrated.&nbsp; It was nice.&nbsp; I *was* spending a bit too much 
            time playing.&nbsp; But I quickly realized how insanely boring my 
            life was.&nbsp; You know, when you're done with your daily 
            responsibilities. . .it's late at night, no one to go out with etc. 
            . .that's the best time for EQ.&nbsp; What did I do instead?&nbsp; 
            Well shit.&nbsp; First there was TV.&nbsp; I swear to god I don't 
            know how people watch television.&nbsp; I read EQ message boards and 
            I hear people flame hardcore gamers for having high /played 
            times.&nbsp; Wonder what people's /watched would look like if TV had 
            that feature.&nbsp; Jesus, television isn't suited for retarded 
            chimps.&nbsp; It's so bad.&nbsp; "Oh my god, Survivor was so good 
            this week, some dumb numbnuts breathed in smoke and passed out in 
            the fire!"&nbsp; Puh-lease.</P>
            <P align=left>After giving up on TV, I tried to fill that nighttime 
            void with another computer game.&nbsp; The one I always liked most, 
            before EQ at least, was Counterstrike.&nbsp; Counterstrike is a 
            great game but I must say, EQ spoiled me a bit.&nbsp; Granted, our 
            guildchat is not exactly what I'd call intelectually elite. . .it 
            does at least go beyond the limits of what Counterstrike can 
            provide, which apparently is, "Fag. Camper. Laaaag. Fuck You."&nbsp; 
            Those four phrases are all you need for a lifetime of happy 
            fragging.</P>
            <P align=left>I missed my friends.&nbsp; I really don't care what 
            we're doing, I just missed the group of people I got to know 
            online.&nbsp; You can criticize computer games for being anti-social 
            all you want, but it beats sitting around watching 10 dirty, greedy, 
            retards eat a chicken in the Australian Outback.</P>
            <P align=left>Enough of my rambling.&nbsp; I am supposed to be 
            sharing with you all Uber l33t l3wtz and stuff, right?&nbsp; Well, 
            sheeit.&nbsp; Problem is our roster has&nbsp;been hurting 
            lately.&nbsp; We lost a lot of good friends the past few 
            weeks.&nbsp; So we've been taking it&nbsp;easy.&nbsp; About 14 of us 
            went to check out the new portion of Hate tonight.&nbsp; Hate was 
            always one of my favorite&nbsp;zones.&nbsp; Apparently, a 
            breastplate drops off of nearly everyone of those lower mobs these 
            days. . .hehe.&nbsp; We spend our time up top though.&nbsp; Killing 
            the new stuff.&nbsp; Drops were fairly scarce up there but there 
            were some neat sites.</P>

            <P align=center>A-very-a-nice-a</P>
            <P align=left>Like I said, we don't really have the numbers to kill 
            much right now.&nbsp; Luckily, lots of people took a break and are 
            now returning, refreshed and ready for uber-leetness once 
            again.&nbsp; I wish I had dead Inny pictures or new Inny loot to 
            post for ya, but well, I don't. . .and I wont. . .at least for a few 
            days :p&nbsp; BTW, should be interesting in the new Planes 
            now.&nbsp; Inny and CT are no more Poosae-Freebie-Mo Faka's. . 
            .Luckily, for the pick-up raid crews, the old god loot drops all 
            over the place, is cake to get and the other armor drops are more 
            frequent than ever.&nbsp; You foolmans have it easy.&nbsp; We camped 
            Hate and Fear for ages, stuck at level 50, for armor that hardly 
            ever dropped.&nbsp; We also walked to school uphill in the 
            snow.&nbsp; Both ways.</P>
            <P align=left>So&nbsp;what do you do when you feel the need for an 
            Epic Battle yet your roster is anything but epic?&nbsp; Take 4 of 
            your good friends and go on a Priest of Discord hunting spree.&nbsp; 
            Worked for&nbsp;us the other night:</P>
