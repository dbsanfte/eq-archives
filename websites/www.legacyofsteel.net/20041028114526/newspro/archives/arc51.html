Who woulda             guessed.&nbsp; Next stop was the Halls of Testing where we laid             Doze-slacker Version 5.0 out like clockwork.&nbsp; Then we popped             back out to get another key from Sontalak.&nbsp; Those Sontalak             fights are epic.&nbsp; Of course we get a crazy lag spike when             Sontalak engrages.&nbsp; Too funny -- watching a dozen people die to             enraged all at once.&nbsp; Yes, Desp did get the killing blow but             fear not, he still sucks.</P>            <P align=left>To finish the night we were going to try out             Lendiniara the Keeper.&nbsp; We had a hell of a good time fighting             her.&nbsp;

We absolutely             ripped through Sleepers.&nbsp; Our goal was to find the elusive mob             called <STRONG>Z-Axis</STRONG>. . .we needed to try Dictate on him,             lifetap for slow.&nbsp; We all had our Res Effects buffs in place             but Z-Axis never spawned.&nbsp; Instead, we decided to destroy the             Warders of Sleepers Tomb.&nbsp; This was our first chance actually             seeing them up.&nbsp; Previously we had a bunch of !placeholders to             contend with.&nbsp; </P>            <P align=left>So we kill the Final Arbitor and we were sitting             around buffing up for our next fight.&nbsp; Leick and I both notice             that flying gargoyle that roams between the Warders so Leick tells             me, "Grab it, Tig."&nbsp; Being the fantastic noobie moron I am (you             really need to get to know me to appreciate just what a n00b I can             be) I shoot my l33t Adarra's Bow at him.&nbsp; Of course, rather             than the Garg turning and coming to attack me, he takes off in the             other direction toward Nanzata the Warder.&nbsp; Cue Dueling Banjos             as the Halfling goes down.&nbsp; So that's how we decided which             Warder to kill first.&nbsp; That prick cacksugging mo faka beeotch             Nanzata had to die.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_7/nanzata_dead.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG><EM>Always fun killing a mob on your first             attempt. . .</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left>The next Warder looked like Silverwing so we just knew             he had to be a big phat poosae.&nbsp;

Hraashna absolutely destroyed us on             our first attempt.&nbsp; We had very little knowledge as to what             sort of strat to use against him.&nbsp; We just kinda saw the dude             and went for it.&nbsp; Needless to say we learned a lot.&nbsp; What             happened next was pure magic.&nbsp; Keep in mind we had 26 people in             Sleepers.&nbsp; We ressed up, came up with a kick-ass strat and beat             Hraashna in what, if I dare say, might have been one of our crowning             moments.&nbsp; With 26 people this was not a matter of "Press A" and             hope for the best.&nbsp; Every single person in there was on the             exact same page.&nbsp; He might not be the toughest mob in EQ but             with the raid force we had it was a fantastic challenge and an even             greater victory.</P>            <P align=left>Ok. . .yea, yea, yea, Tig, shut the fuck up,             right?&nbsp;
