I, as did the thousands of other people             logged onto The Nameless server at the time, read the following             broadcast as it flashed onto my screen:</FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3><STRONG><FONT color=#ffff00>[Tue Sep 11 19:25:26             2001] Kahil BROADCASTS, 'Hello everyone, I have just been informed             that our Enchanter BotB has been moved to Saturday the 15th of             September as of yet we do not have a time but I will let you know as             soon as possable.[sic]'</FONT></STRONG> <br></FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3>Fast forward to Wednesday evening. Upon logging into             The Nameless, I hear rumors that the Enchanter Best of the Best is             going on in the Arena. How is this so? Didn’t they just broadcast –             BROADCAST – that the tournament would be on Saturday? My first             reaction was to contact the GM running the event in the arena. I             asked him how the event could possibly be taking place when the             majority of enchanters on The Nameless were told by Verant employees             that the tournament would not be until Saturday. The GM simply             responded, "Read the MOTD." So following his advice I type, /motd             and see a notice that the Enchanter BotB will take place on             Wednesday at 4pst pm.</FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3>So apparently, even though a Verant Employee             <STRONG>BROADCAST</STRONG> (you know <STRONG>BROADCAST</STRONG>,             that bright yellow text that reaches <STRONG>EVERY</STRONG> person             on the server who is online at the time) that the BotB will be on             Saturday, somehow setting a MOTD sometime late Tuesday night or             early Wednesday morning justifies the last minute change of schedule             thus denying dozens of enchanters their fair shot at participating.             Was the assumption that people continuously log on <STRONG>ALL DAY             LONG</STRONG> checking the MOTD in order to see if an event is             rescheduled? The mere suggestion is ridiculous. Most people log off             at night and aren’t able to log back on until sometime the next             night after school or work.</FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3>What’s worse is, the numerous Guides and GM’s I             spoke with <STRONG>KNEW</STRONG> what they did was wrong. They kept             apologizing for the mistake. YET somehow the event kept going. I             believe there were something like 8 enchanters who knew about it.             The Verant Event Staff was not able to realize that in the two             previous BotB (Cleric and Bard) there were well over 20             participants. Instead they rushed through the tournament with the             "select eight" who were privileged enough to be allowed to             participate.</FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3>The action that Verant decided to take on Wednesday             just reaffirmed my belief that the company’s Customer Service ethic             is simply atrocious. How about, Verant, instead of making excuses             for once, you take some action to do the right thing. How can a             tournament award a title to someone as "The Best of the Best" when             you didn’t give everyone a chance to participate? Why wasn’t the             event rescheduled? At the very least you should be refunding EVERY             54+ enchanter their 10 dollars this month since you promised them a             product and didn’t deliver. If you buy an airline ticket for a             flight that leaves on Saturday, that flight leaves on Saturday (NOT             WEDNESDAY) or else you get your money back. The talk of refunding             money surely will grab your attention, Verant Interactive. And if             you’re not willing to refund the Enchanters who were shafted through             your <STRONG>FALSE ADVERTISING</STRONG> then perhaps you can hold a             valid tournament, where the actual date and time are public             information, given out more than 24 hours in advance.</FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3>The Best of the Best tournaments are extremely             special to some players. It is the <STRONG>ONE AND ONLY</STRONG>             chance players have a chance to compete against each other. Whether             they win or now, most players are simply happy to be given the             chance to participate in a celebration of their class.</FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3>If you play on a different server and think the sham             that occurred on The Nameless doesn’t affect you, you’re wrong. The             entire Enchanter BotB has had it’s integrity compromised. Whoever             wins that final, will you be satisfied wearing a title that claims             you are better than everyone else when in fact dozens of             participants were denied a chance to show their skills? <STRONG>I             HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL BOTB ENCHANTERS</STRONG>, please <STRONG>DO             NOT</STRONG> participate in the Finals. I know you’re thinking, who             are you Tigole, to tell me not to go to the finals. I suggest you             <STRONG>BOYCOTT</STRONG> the finals until Verant decides to be             accountable for their <STRONG>GLARING MISTAKE</STRONG> and             reschedules The Nameless tournament. Imagine if the same situation             happened to you. Imagine if you logged onto your server one day and             saw someone else wearing the title you so obviously earned through             your skills. The enchanters of The Nameless need your support.             </FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3>Verant, you should feel nothing but shame. You             <STRONG>KNOW</STRONG> you were wrong. Yet no real action was taken             to fix the problem. Yes, you are the gods of the world of Everquest,             you make the rules (and seem to change them on us). However, when             it's all said and done, we are paying customers. Your shoddy             customer service and repeated lack of accountability will be your             ultimate failure. How about instead of burying your head in the sand             for once, you grow a spine and do the right thing.</FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3>--Tigole Bitties</FONT></P>            <P><FONT size=3><EM>As a footnote I’d like to add that it was very             hard for me to make this update. Dashi from Shock of Swords was             awarded the title of victor of Wednesday’s event. Dashi is an             extremely talented enchanter, no doubt perfectly capable of winning             a full-fledged "actual" tournament. I have no doubt that Dashi could             win the title if a fair tournament was held. Dashi was one of the             enchanters I had the honor of raiding the Avatar of War with. In no             way do I want to diminish Dashi’s skills as an enchanter. My rant is             directed at Verant and I apologize that in having to point out a             company’s lack of basic business knowledge, it might come off as a             comment about Dashi or Dashi’s skills. Not at all. Dashi is an             excellent enchanter and more than capable of securing the BotB             title.</EM></FONT></P></FONT></FONT></FONT></font><a name="newsitem1000191600,13516,"></a><P
