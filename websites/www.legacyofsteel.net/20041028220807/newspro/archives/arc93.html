Being a regular Walter Friggin             Kronkite I was able to use my sleuth journalistic skills to get my             hands on an early version of the patch message:</P>            <P align=left><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM><FONT size=4>Patch Message, Novermber 9,             2000</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*The lure line of spells was found to be             too effective and has been removed.&nbsp; To compensate we have             given Wizards and upgrade to O'Kiell's Radiation called O'Malley's             Radiation.&nbsp; This new damage shield now does 3 instead of 2             points of damage.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*The cast time on complete heal was upped             to 20 seconds to insure that no rogue or monk ever             lives.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*The spell evacuate now only works             outdoors.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*Druids now have the ability to revive,             feign death, backstab, and mesmerize mobs.&nbsp;

Amulek now has             two wet noodles hanging from his waist instead of just one.&nbsp;             Zordak also dropped some nifty gloves which went to <STRONG>Uggly             Fleshbeater</STRONG> and a breastplate which <STRONG>Signel</STRONG>             now wears.&nbsp;

To my surprise and             delight, Venril was. . .UP!&nbsp; I often wonder what it's like to             have a lifespan of approximately 45 minutes.&nbsp; Well, I don't             wonder too hard.</P>            <P align=center><IMG             alt="Venril, put your hands on the ground, you have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used. . ."             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november/11_9/venril_11_9.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Here's the <STRONG>Venril Sathir Loot</STRONG> which             has not yet been awarded.&nbsp;

Our main objective was a             raid on the <STRONG>Royal Palace</STRONG> burried deep within the             dungeon.&nbsp; First stop was the <STRONG>Prince's</STRONG>             chamber.&nbsp;

Our main             hope was that the Queen would drop the blade required for the             Warrior Epic Quest.&nbsp; Instead she dropped a bunch of junk not             worthy to sell in the <STRONG>East Commons</STRONG> tunnel.&nbsp;
