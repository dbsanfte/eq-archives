            <P></P>
            <P align=left>The plan of the night was to go to 
            <STRONG>Necropolis</STRONG> and keeel 
            <STRONG>Zlandicar</STRONG>.&nbsp; Everythng was going 
            smoothly.&nbsp; We even ran into our old friend, 
            <STRONG>Vaniki</STRONG>.&nbsp; Here's us giving him a big 
            LoS-Hello:</P>

            <P align=center>Congrats to <STRONG>Cowboy</STRONG>!</P>

            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>So getting the Willsapper for Leick was good 
            news.&nbsp; But then I went to check on Zlandicar.&nbsp; I was 
            hoping to need to be CoH'd outta there with a big dragon on my ass, 
            or else end up dead leaving a pain in the ass CR for one of my 
            guildmates. . .then we could regroup and do some 
            dragon-ass-kicking.&nbsp; Instead I found myself in a very 
            empty&nbsp;Zlandicar's Lair.&nbsp; One thing I did find interesting, 
            I set off nine traps scouting the place. . .not a single one did 
            damage or break invis.&nbsp; And yes, I was using Sense Traps but 
            the damned refresh time is too long for me to stand around waiting 
            for it to pop each time.&nbsp; Oh well, I guess I should STFU and 
            not complain.&nbsp; Knowing Verant they will patch in 
            impossible-to-sense, deathtouching traps if they read this.</P>
            <P align=left>As you can guess, we were pretty bummed that there was 
            no fuggin dragon to beat down.&nbsp; But, you might also say, well 
            why didn't that dumbass halfling go check earlier?&nbsp; Actually, 
            don't say that please.&nbsp; Or else blame it on Desp.&nbsp; Desp 
            said Zlandicar was up.&nbsp; WTF Desp. . .wasting all our time 
            there.&nbsp; Fuggin Desp.</P>
            <P align=left>Disappointed yet still eager to keeel, we headed over 
            to Dorf Town to lay our blades to that cacksugger, <STRONG>The 
            Dain</STRONG>.&nbsp; For those of you who follow our exploits, 
            you'll remember that&nbsp;we have never gotten to fight His 
            Shittyiness the Dain.&nbsp; Each time he has poofed on us.&nbsp; 
            Well, I hate to say it but when the&nbsp;Dain declared this last 
            night, he wasn't joking:</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt="" 
            src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/dain_quote.jpg" 
            border=0></P>
            <P align=center>Yup, he was right</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt=""

            <P align=center>4 Dain Attempts, 4 Poofs</P>
            <P align=left>Now for all you critics sitting at home I'd like to 
            point out the following.&nbsp; Each time we have pulled the Dain, we 
            have used a different method.&nbsp; We have attempted him in 
            multiple spots.&nbsp; It's not like we enjoy getting everyone to 
            Dorf Town, killing a bunch of 
            high-hit-point-crap-loot-dropping-dorfs only to Poof the Dain 
            because of our Dain-pulling-gimpyness.&nbsp; I'd like to think we 
            have a very decent record of not doing dumbass-gimp things. . .just 
            look at the mobs we have killed time and time again.&nbsp; I 
            seriously hope VI takes a look into this problem or else issues some 
            kind of statement that the Dain is poofing as intended. . .in which 
            case. . .why the fug would you make a mob that poofs for 7 
            days?&nbsp; Please Verant -- log in and send me a tell.&nbsp; It's 
            obvious your Quality Assurance guys are far too busy making sure the 
            fire beetle pathing in West Commons is working right to spend any 
            time on one of the main mobs of your new expansion.&nbsp; LoS will 
            gladly give you some QA time if you'd like to witness your 
            programming at it's worst.</P>
            <P align=left>Well, aren't I just a big cacksugger?&nbsp; Don't 
            answer that please.</P>
            <P align=left>So no update for tomorrow because&nbsp;I won't be 
            playing EQ at all today. . .this gives you more time to stare at 
            Cowboy and wish you were half as cool as he is.</P>
