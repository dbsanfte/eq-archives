Dozekar the Gimped.&nbsp; Perhaps if we still had the "old Doze" to             contend with I wouldn't be so anxious to post this rant.&nbsp; By             Old Doze, some of you actually know what I am talking about.&nbsp;             For those of you who have no clue what I am saying, please go back             to Karnors and continue to bask in your clueslessness.&nbsp;             Basically, Dozekar is or will be the Venril Sathir of late Kunark --             a.k.a Clusterfuck Mob of the Expansion.&nbsp; The symbols from the             named drakes are an equal dick in the ass.&nbsp; Let's not even look             at this from a loot perspective for a minute.&nbsp; From an             excitement-thrill-of-the-kill perpective we get the shaft.&nbsp;             Pro-Giant people have Telk, Goz, Lenidara, Lord Vyemm, Vulak, etc             etc etc etc to&nbsp;kill.&nbsp; More boss mobs then there is time in             the day.&nbsp; Now, don't be a cacksugger and say to me, "Well, you             have Statue, Vind, Tormax."&nbsp; How bout fucking Yelinak and all             of Skyshrine?&nbsp; How bout a 3 month head start on Sleepers?</P>            <P align=left>Anyway, Pro-Dragon people want THINGS TO KEEEL.&nbsp;             I don't care about the goddamned loot.&nbsp; The ToV quest loot is             going to be so rare, it doesn't matter anyway.&nbsp; We're lucky to             complete 3 quests out of 4 Dozekar kills right now (4 doze spawns =             1 month).&nbsp; What happens a few months from now when other guilds             are Doze-capable?&nbsp; It's a fucking joke -- and even Pro-Giant             people know it is.</P>            <P align=left>Here are the solutions I feel would best address this             gross imbalance:</P>            <P align=left>A)&nbsp; Dozekar drops LOOT in addition to             tears.&nbsp; And please, give us old Doze back.&nbsp; Likewise, the             named drakes drop 4-8 symbols each time.&nbsp; These should spawn             every 3 days AT LEAST, including Doze.</P>            <P align=left>B)&nbsp; Add some loot to the named drakes -- buff             them up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make them hard mo fakas. . .make them so hard             it makes farming armor virtually impossible with them up.&nbsp; Give             them random drops like those that exist in North ToV.</P>            <P align=left>C)&nbsp; Remove the faction from North ToV.&nbsp; Give             Telk, Lendinara and Gozz in the West Wing Dozekar-equivalent loot             (so the Pro-Giant people don't bust a nut whining).&nbsp; Pro-Giant             gets 3 dragons, Pro-CoV gets 1, everyone has a shot at the North             Wing mobs.&nbsp; This is the best option in my opinion.</P>            <P align=left>D) If you're going to be a bunch of cacksuggers and             not let us hunt in North ToV, put Doze and the HoT mobs on             +Guardians of Veeshan and +Claws of Veeshan faction.&nbsp; This is             the worst option but at least you'd be throwing us the small bone of             being able to get a shot at PoM.&nbsp; Sure there's nothing more             than a minor fascination with PoM, but we can pass our time there             while waiting 7 days for Dozekar to spawn and drop his 2 tears.</P>            <P align=left>E) You're not going to give us anything more to kill             in ToV? Fine. . .give us Undead Kael or some shit.&nbsp; Or add 10             BOSS level mobs to Kael with HUGE faction hits so Pro-Giant people             stay the fuck away.&nbsp; Make sure to load them with 12/16 daggers             and 14/18 whips. . .ac 90 breastplates while you're at it.&nbsp;             Sounds fair now, right?</P>            <P align=left>Make me God of Everquest and I choose OPTION C             (although E sounds pretty fun too).</P>            <P align=left>Right now, VI has created two choices:&nbsp; 1) Go             Pro-Giant, get fat loots, face many challenges. or 2) Go Pro-Dragon,             farm fat loots. . .zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</P>            <P align=left>Ok I am done ranting.&nbsp; I don't want you Pro-Giant             bitches coming and whining to me on our messageboards.&nbsp; I never             called for any nerf.&nbsp; What I am asking for is for CoV to be             MORE DIFFICULT as a matter of fact.&nbsp; There is more to balance             then just placing *nice items* in different locations.</P>            <P align=left>There's my rant.&nbsp; Of course, this is MY opinion             not necessarily that of anyone in my guild.&nbsp; And like I said,             before accusing me of merely whining, look at things from my             perspective first.</P>            <P align=left>Tigole Bitches</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/arlosea.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/dupbudo.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/parva.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/tenajsmouth.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/tigolesguzzler.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/tigolespooper.jpg"             border=0></P></font><a name="newsitem993711600,61623,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, June 28, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>  <P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>The New Dozekar</FONT></STRONG>             </P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_28/doze.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Um. . .ok</STRONG></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_28/doze_dead_6_27.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>And here he is dead. . .</STRONG></P>            <P align=left>So looks like the Druushk-zekar was replaced with             Mini-Sontalak.&nbsp;

They don't mind some of             these stalker names but others have crossed the line and are *too             offensive*.&nbsp; She then warned that they are going to be cracking             down on the Stalkers and that you losers are responsible for             whatever action they take against you.&nbsp;

First things first.&nbsp; Thatia finished her             epic last week.&nbsp; Man, this was the first epic that actually             felt EPIC getting.&nbsp; Basically, Thatia was going off of old             information.&nbsp; We spawned that mo faka in CoM with basically no             preparation.&nbsp; "Oh, he's poosae -- you can kill him with one             group."&nbsp; Well, try taking one group to kill Lhranc.&nbsp;             Anyway, getting everyone there in time for a second try was quite an             experience.&nbsp; Needless to say, there's the picture of Thatia             with her epic.&nbsp; Oh, and don't come bitching to me about why             didn't I research the quest better -- not my damned epic, you             foolmans.</P>            <P align=left>Let's see.&nbsp; What else died since the last update.             . .oh.&nbsp; Doze-slacker bit the dust and dropped some more             tears.&nbsp; The spawn times on the drakes is currently killing             us.&nbsp; Also the fact that 9 out of 10 times they seem to drop the             damned Glowing Orb is also fairly fucked.&nbsp; I'm calling it right             now folks, Dozekar and those ToV quests are the biggest clusterfuck             spawn waiting to happen. . .</P>            <P align=left>But here's a pic of the big guy dead:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_26/dozedead.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Killed the Dain last night too.&nbsp; I don't take             pictures of that slack-daddy any more.&nbsp; He was the super Dain             but we took him down so quick and easy calling him super is a bit of             a joke.&nbsp; After the Dain we decided to try to get a white scale             for a bard epic.&nbsp; We headed over to DL and right when we get to             the buff spot some fool trains Gore on us.&nbsp; Even unbuffed and             ungrouped we got him to Gore.&nbsp; We were kind of pissed about the             jackass Tom Foolery so we quickly buffed up and pulled Gore for             true.&nbsp; We dropped the bastard in approximately 10 seconds with             zero deaths.&nbsp; I'm not sure anyone even needed a cheal.&nbsp; No             one in my group lost a single hit point.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_26/goredead_6_25.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Anyway, congrats to Dorana on the scale for her Epic             bard thingy.</P>            <P align=left>So it's been a busy week.&nbsp;
