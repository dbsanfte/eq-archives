            <P align=left>A major wrench was thrown in our plans with the 
            movement of today's patch.&nbsp; No big deal.&nbsp; We tried to help 
            <STRONG>Arlos</STRONG> complete his Epic Weapon Quest but 
            unfortunately the quest is bugged and where two mobs are supposed to 
            spawn, only one showed up for the beat-down.&nbsp; Luckily, the GM's 
            reimbursed Arlos with the items he lost by turning them in so we can 
            try again tomorrow and hope for the luck of <STRONG>Verant</STRONG> 
            to be on our side (cough, cough).&nbsp; If nothing else, Arlos and 
            the rest of us our confident that the quest bugs will be squashed in 
            the patch that was conveniently delayed today.</P>

            <P align=left>In other "guild news" it was an exciting day as Alam

            level 28 cleric and Alam McHealer was the prime candidate.&nbsp; 
            After accepting our pleas for him to wear the &lt;Legacy of 
            Steel&gt; badge above his head, we let Alam McHealer have his way 
            with Despie, guild slooot and all-around fun time on two legs.&nbsp;

            <P><STRONG>Trakanon: I Hate He</STRONG>. . . . . October 30, 2000 -- 
            Tigole Bitties</P>
            <P align=left>With all the times we've killed the poison beast of 
            <STRONG>Old Sebilis</STRONG>, he can still manage to whipe out even 
            the seemingly most coordinated effort.&nbsp; 
            <STRONG>Translation</STRONG>: <EM>we got owned when the fugger 
            gated</EM>.&nbsp; </P>
            <P align=left>Never ones to give up, we quickly recovered and set 
            about blasting <STRONG>Trakanon</STRONG> with as much whoopass as we 
            could muster, which I must say, was quite a bit.&nbsp; A hardy 
            thanks goes out to <STRONG>Ronald Johnson</STRONG>, who was 
            responsible for getting the raid back on its feet in record 
            time.&nbsp; Take it from me, corpse recovery and ressurection of 
            30-some people in the dragon's lair is not an easy task.</P>

            <P align=left>We were pleased with the loot.&nbsp; <STRONG>Hammyr

            <STRONG>Tork</STRONG> both recieved one of the mighty beast's teeth 
            so that they can complete their quest to enter <STRONG>Veeshan's 
            Peak</STRONG>.&nbsp; Yes, even in Veeshan's Peak <STRONG>Tork's 
            Mom</STRONG> is heavily camped.&nbsp; The dragon also dropped

            <P align=center><STRONG>The Kick</STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
            <P align=left>Now, I'd like to take an opportunity to relate a 
            <STRONG>Halfling Interest Story</STRONG>. . .Normally, I try to keep 
            these pages focused on the triumphs of a certain guild of 
            War-Mongers, conquering Norrath from Paineel to the Emerald 
            Jungle.&nbsp; But every now and then, the story of one can be used 
            to illustrate the cohesiveness and dominance of friendship through 
            arms.</P>
            <P align=left>When we last left the Halfling Hero of this Story, 
            let's call him. . . oh. . . um. . . <STRONG>Tigole Bitties</STRONG>. 
            . .he was hard at work with the <STRONG>Minstrel Jangos</STRONG> and 
            the <STRONG>Mighty Barbarian Leick</STRONG> in <STRONG>Mistmoore 
            Castle</STRONG>.&nbsp; The unlikely threesome was not after 
            Treasure, they simply wanted to shed the blood of those who the 
            <STRONG>Ring of Scale</STRONG> opposed.&nbsp; You see, this Trio was 
            in the business of Dragon-slaying.&nbsp; Perhaps this picture from 
            yesterday will refresh your memory of what Jangos, Leick and Tig did 
            to right themselves in the eyes of the Ring:</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt="Questing for Faction" 
            src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/faction_1027.jpg" 
            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>When the three went their seperate ways for the night, 
            they went to bed resting easy, knowing&nbsp;that they had fixed 
            their standing with the Fiery Denizens that plagued the Land.</P>
            <P align=left>But then <STRONG>Tig</STRONG> went for a little stroll 
            in the <STRONG>Emerald Jungle</STRONG>.&nbsp; He had heard that 
            there was a Dragon running loose.&nbsp;But Emerald Jungle, while a 
            long and harrowed journey from Rivervale, was a relatively safe 
            place for a Halfling who had spent some hard time righting himself 
            in the eyes of the ring of Scale.&nbsp; Everything was looking his 
            way. . .He picked some wild flowers to give to his love, 
            <STRONG>Umberlee</STRONG>.&nbsp; He laughed as he passed the quiet 
            young couple known as <STRONG>Tenaj</STRONG> and 
            <STRONG>Winkin</STRONG>.&nbsp; No, he told them, I don't know what 
            this <STRONG>HGS</STRONG> is you two seek so openly.</P>
            <P align=left><STRONG>Tigole</STRONG> returned to his journey, 
            sneaking a bit more cautiously after meeting the *<EM>odd</EM>* 
            fellows.&nbsp; And then. . .out of no where. . .he got. . . 
            kicked.</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt=Whoops! 
            src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/kick_10_29.jpg" 
            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>Well, anyone who knows the Halfling, knows that he 
            doesn't take a kick to the rump in stride.&nbsp; If there was one 
            thing Tig could always count on, it was his friends.&nbsp; 
            "Kicked!?" they declared, when brought the odd news.&nbsp;"No, no 
            no."&nbsp; With upmost haste, the guild of friends assembled in the 
            Emerald Jungle.&nbsp; "Try that kick again," they said.&nbsp; Only 
            this time, <STRONG>Severilous</STRONG> found himself on the wrong 
            end of the boot.</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt="Severilous strikes a pose"

            <P align=left>Upon the stinking, dead carcass of the dragon they 
            found some interesting loot.&nbsp; <STRONG>Keke Dabadoo</STRONG>, 
            Troll Warrior, found a <STRONG>Red</STRONG> and a <STRONG>Green 
            Dragon scale</STRONG>. . .two items he had been questing for as they 
            were rumored to be needed for a long and epic sword quest.&nbsp; 
            <STRONG>Demius the Dorf</STRONG> found a <STRONG>Treasure Hunters 
            Satche</STRONG>l which greatly reduced the weight of his 
            possessions.&nbsp; Some other interesting items were found:</P>
            <P align=center><IMG alt=Horn

            <P align=left>This last item the adventurers let 
            <STRONG>Tigole</STRONG> keep as a reminder of his 
            <STRONG>Kick</STRONG>.&nbsp; It was a special item to the Halfling 
            since those of his race could not normally wear items of this 
            sort.&nbsp; I wish I could report a happy ending to this story, but 
            unfortunately <STRONG>Tigole</STRONG> was killed shortly after this 
            event by the infamous <STRONG>Cliff</STRONG> 
            <STRONG>Monster</STRONG> of <STRONG>Emerald Jungle</STRONG>.&nbsp; 
            The <STRONG>Princess Umberlee</STRONG> was left Widowedand 
            Heartbroken.&nbsp; I guess since there needs to be a happy ending to 
            this tale, we'll end this as a "Fairy" tale,&nbsp; with 
            <STRONG>Winkin</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tenaj</STRONG>, who did 
            ultimately find what they were questing for -- <STRONG>HGS</STRONG> 
            -- and trust me, this ending was a "<EM>happy</EM>" one.</P>

            <P>Some might consider up until this point a fairly full day.&nbsp; 
            But not us.&nbsp; <STRONG>Arlos</STRONG> needed to take care of a 
            Quest Mob up in the <STRONG>Plane of Sky</STRONG>.&nbsp; So from 
            <STRONG>Veeshan's Peak</STRONG> to <STRONG>Plane of Air</STRONG> we 
            went.&nbsp; While there, we assisted <STRONG>Arlos</STRONG> in the 
            beat down of <STRONG>Gwan</STRONG>, some fool monk who had it coming 
            to him.&nbsp; Now <STRONG>Arlos</STRONG> is one step closer to 
            completing his Epic quest.</P>

            <P align=left>What better way to end the day. . .or night. . . or 
            morning. . .or whatever the hell it is now. . .then by fixing all 
            that <STRONG>faction</STRONG> we ruined.&nbsp; Don't think faction 
            is a big deal?&nbsp; Kill one to three dragons a day for a few 
            months then try to take a leisurely stroll through 
            <STRONG>Dreadlands</STRONG> past <STRONG>Gorenaire</STRONG>.&nbsp; A 
            little <STRONG>Mistmoore</STRONG> <STRONG>whoopass</STRONG> goes a 
            long way.&nbsp; Just ask <STRONG>Jangos</STRONG> and
