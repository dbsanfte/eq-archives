To compensate we have             given Wizards and upgrade to O'Kiell's Radiation called O'Malley's             Radiation.&nbsp; This new damage shield now does 3 instead of 2             points of damage.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*The cast time on complete heal was upped             to 20 seconds to insure that no rogue or monk ever             lives.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*The spell evacuate now only works             outdoors.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*Druids now have the ability to revive,             feign death, backstab, and mesmerize mobs.&nbsp;

This should             reduce the frequency of *bad* drops signifigantly.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><EM>*We have been hearing complaints of our             customers that drop rates were uneven and unbalanced between various             dungeons such as Old Sebilis and Chardok, for example.&nbsp; Always             in tune with our customers wants, we moved the Sarnak Battle Shield,             Golem Tear Ring, and Incardine armor to the Old Sebilis             crypt.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><EM><STRONG>*Rangers were removed from the game -- we             give up.</STRONG></EM></P>            <P align=left>And now back to the news. . .</P>            <P align=left>Yesterday started in typical fashion -- another day,             another dragon slaying. . .This time it was <STRONG>Zordak             Ragefire</STRONG>, whose death resulted in <STRONG>Amulek</STRONG>             being able to complete his Epic Weapon Quest.&nbsp; Amulek now has             two wet noodles hanging from his waist instead of just one.&nbsp;             Zordak also dropped some nifty gloves which went to <STRONG>Uggly             Fleshbeater</STRONG> and a breastplate which <STRONG>Signel</STRONG>             now wears.&nbsp;

The King was so much fun to kill, we stuck around and did             it again later on.&nbsp; Both <STRONG>Amulek</STRONG> and             <STRONG>Demius</STRONG> were able to loot the note that he drops to             continue their questing.&nbsp;

Our main             hope was that the Queen would drop the blade required for the             Warrior Epic Quest.&nbsp; Instead she dropped a bunch of junk not             worthy to sell in the <STRONG>East Commons</STRONG> tunnel.&nbsp; At             least the fighting was fun.&nbsp; That in itself was a nice             reward.</P>            <P align=center><STRONG><EM>God Save the Queen. . .well, actually,             Let the Bitch Rot</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt="Queen. . .Under Pressure"             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november/11_8/queen.jpg"             border=0></P>
