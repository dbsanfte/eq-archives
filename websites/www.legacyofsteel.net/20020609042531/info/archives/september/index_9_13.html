            <P><FONT size=3>Tuesday night, whether because of the patch or the 
            horrendous tragedies in the U.S., the Enchanter Best of the Best 
            tournament was rescheduled. I, as did the thousands of other people 
            logged onto The Nameless server at the time, read the following 
            broadcast as it flashed onto my screen:</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=3><STRONG><FONT color=#ffff00>[Tue Sep 11 19:25:26 
            2001] Kahil BROADCASTS, 'Hello everyone, I have just been informed 
            that our Enchanter BotB has been moved to Saturday the 15th of 
            September as of yet we do not have a time but I will let you know as 
            soon as possable.[sic]'</FONT></STRONG> <BR></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=3>Fast forward to Wednesday evening. Upon logging into 
            The Nameless, I hear rumors that the Enchanter Best of the Best is 
            going on in the Arena. How is this so? Didn’t they just broadcast – 
            BROADCAST – that the tournament would be on Saturday? My first 
            reaction was to contact the GM running the event in the arena. I 
            asked him how the event could possibly be taking place when the 
            majority of enchanters on The Nameless were told by Verant employees 
            that the tournament would not be until Saturday. The GM simply 
            responded, "Read the MOTD." So following his advice I type, /motd 
            and see a notice that the Enchanter BotB will take place on 
            Wednesday at 4pst pm.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=3>So apparently, even though a Verant Employee 
            <STRONG>BROADCAST</STRONG> (you know <STRONG>BROADCAST</STRONG>, 
            that bright yellow text that reaches <STRONG>EVERY</STRONG> person 
            on the server who is online at the time) that the BotB will be on 
            Saturday, somehow setting a MOTD sometime late Tuesday night or 
            early Wednesday morning justifies the last minute change of schedule 
            thus denying dozens of enchanters their fair shot at participating. 
            Was the assumption that people continuously log on <STRONG>ALL DAY 
            LONG</STRONG> checking the MOTD in order to see if an event is 
            rescheduled? The mere suggestion is ridiculous. Most people log off 
            at night and aren’t able to log back on until sometime the next 
            night after school or work.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=3>What’s worse is, the numerous Guides and GM’s I 
            spoke with <STRONG>KNEW</STRONG> what they did was wrong. They kept 
            apologizing for the mistake. YET somehow the event kept going. I 
            believe there were something like 8 enchanters who knew about it. 
            The Verant Event Staff was not able to realize that in the two 
            previous BotB (Cleric and Bard) there were well over 20 
            participants. Instead they rushed through the tournament with the 
            "select eight" who were privileged enough to be allowed to 
            participate.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=3>The action that Verant decided to take on Wednesday 
            just reaffirmed my belief that the company’s Customer Service ethic 
            is simply atrocious. How about, Verant, instead of making excuses 
            for once, you take some action to do the right thing. How can a 
            tournament award a title to someone as "The Best of the Best" when 
            you didn’t give everyone a chance to participate? Why wasn’t the 
            event rescheduled? At the very least you should be refunding EVERY 
            54+ enchanter their 10 dollars this month since you promised them a 
            product and didn’t deliver. If you buy an airline ticket for a 
            flight that leaves on Saturday, that flight leaves on Saturday (NOT 
            WEDNESDAY) or else you get your money back. The talk of refunding 
            money surely will grab your attention, Verant Interactive. And if 
            you’re not willing to refund the Enchanters who were shafted through 
            your <STRONG>FALSE ADVERTISING</STRONG> then perhaps you can hold a 
            valid tournament, where the actual date and time are public 
            information, given out more than 24 hours in advance.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=3>The Best of the Best tournaments are extremely 
            special to some players. It is the <STRONG>ONE AND ONLY</STRONG> 
            chance players have a chance to compete against each other. Whether 
            they win or now, most players are simply happy to be given the 
            chance to participate in a celebration of their class.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=3>If you play on a different server and think the sham 
            that occurred on The Nameless doesn’t affect you, you’re wrong. The 
            entire Enchanter BotB has had it’s integrity compromised. Whoever 
            wins that final, will you be satisfied wearing a title that claims 
            you are better than everyone else when in fact dozens of 
            participants were denied a chance to show their skills? <STRONG>I 
            HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL BOTB ENCHANTERS</STRONG>, please <STRONG>DO 
            NOT</STRONG> participate in the Finals. I know you’re thinking, who 
            are you Tigole, to tell me not to go to the finals. I suggest you 
            <STRONG>BOYCOTT</STRONG> the finals until Verant decides to be 
            accountable for their <STRONG>GLARING MISTAKE</STRONG> and 
            reschedules The Nameless tournament. Imagine if the same situation 
            happened to you. Imagine if you logged onto your server one day and 
            saw someone else wearing the title you so obviously earned through 
            your skills. The enchanters of The Nameless need your support. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=3>Verant, you should feel nothing but shame. You 
            <STRONG>KNOW</STRONG> you were wrong. Yet no real action was taken 
            to fix the problem. Yes, you are the gods of the world of Everquest, 
            you make the rules (and seem to change them on us). However, when 
            it's all said and done, we are paying customers. Your shoddy 
            customer service and repeated lack of accountability will be your 
            ultimate failure. How about instead of burying your head in the sand 
            for once, you grow a spine and do the right thing.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT size=3><EM>As a footnote I’d like to add that it was very 
            hard for me to make this update. Dashi from Shock of Swords was 
            awarded the title of victor of Wednesday’s event. Dashi is an 
            extremely talented enchanter, no doubt perfectly capable of winning 
            a full-fledged "actual" tournament. I have no doubt that Dashi could 
            win the title if a fair tournament was held. Dashi was one of the 
            enchanters I had the honor of raiding the Avatar of War with. In no 
            way do I want to diminish Dashi’s skills as an enchanter. My rant is 
            directed at Verant and I apologize that in having to point out a 
            company’s lack of basic business knowledge, it might come off as a 
            comment about Dashi or Dashi’s skills. Not at all. Dashi is an 
            excellent enchanter and more than capable of securing the BotB 
            title.</EM></FONT></P></FONT></FONT></FONT></font></span></td>
