A zone I once loathed is now kind of fun again.&nbsp;             Mostly, we just let <STRONG>Nizzarr</STRONG> train us over and over             and the zone gets cleared in record time.&nbsp; Was the first time             we had a chance to see the new Draco.&nbsp; Ok, WTF?&nbsp; The new             Draco seems like MORE of a Poosae than the old one.&nbsp; If you             wanna nerf something VI, nerf fuggin Draco.&nbsp; Make that mo faka             grow some testicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our clerics finished the fight             FM.&nbsp; I took ZERO damage.&nbsp; Our taunting warriors took no             damage.&nbsp; Those Golems are more difficult than that joke of a             "dragon". . .</FONT></P>            <P align=left>So here's the lewtz from ol' poosae dragon bones. .             .</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_28/fearsomeshield.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_28/valia.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Congrats <STRONG>Valia</STRONG> on the new shield</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_28/zombiefleshbracer.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Grats to <STRONG>Medicd</STRONG> on the bracer</P>            <P align=left>So what's the deal with the shield?&nbsp; Wasn't that             the GODLY cloak all the warriors got over the last two weeks?&nbsp;             Did they do a retroactive nerf or are there a bunch of ub3r l33t             warriors running around with Blades of Tactics in one hand and their             Draco Mistoore Deal in the other?&nbsp; Hope they had the common             sense to not tweak the old shields.&nbsp; </P>            <P align=left>So we killed CT again.&nbsp; Was really fun.&nbsp; Not             a single LD so perhaps the server-side filtering does work.&nbsp;             Some reported the same lag but it could have been processor or video             card problems.&nbsp; Either way, we had no LD's.&nbsp; And that's             saying a lot because our CT strategy involves 120 people bind             rushing him over and over until he dies.&nbsp; It's l33t.&nbsp; I             read about it at the Safehouse.&nbsp; CT dropped that godly,             jaw-dropping neck/belt again and it went to             <STRONG>Cyni</STRONG>.&nbsp; He also dropped the cloak which             <STRONG>Galiaan</STRONG> now has.</P>            <P align=left>We finished Fear and some of us were bored.&nbsp; We             ran over to Velk's and killed the Freeti Monk, scoring an Icicle             Tunic for <STRONG>Arlos</STRONG>.</P>            <P align=left>That was that.&nbsp; As usual, was a fun night =)</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_28/cynistalkers.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_28/paynesteward.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_28/tigolestalker.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_28/pigfookintigole.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Quote of the             Day</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_28/saldor_quote.jpg"             border=0></P></font><a name="newsitem985680000,31725,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Back In The Saddle Again</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Tuesday, March 27, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>  <P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>Dragon-Free             Necropolis</FONT></STRONG> </P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Zlandicar Crooning with Frank             Sinatra</STRONG></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_27/zlanddead_3_26.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Since I managed to piss off a fair amount of people             with my "tasteless" and "out of line" reference to <STRONG>Payne             Stewart</STRONG> last week, I decided to make it my personal mission             to attempt to offend everyone.&nbsp;

<STRONG>Zlandicar</STRONG>             died today.&nbsp; Was one of our smoothest raids to date with a few             exceptions.&nbsp; First off, <STRONG>Uggly</STRONG> had LD'd in ToV             last night and couldn't get back on.&nbsp; He knew he would need a             necro to summon him when he logged back in.&nbsp; Apparently, when             <STRONG>Xandralia</STRONG> and <STRONG>Necrath</STRONG> went to get             Uggly, they didn't realize that some druid was attempting to solo             Wyverms from the sacred area out at the four way             interesection.&nbsp; <STRONG>Crogon</STRONG> was that you?&nbsp;             Nah, couldn't have been. . .=P</P>            <P align=left>Once that delay was over, we were all set to             charge.&nbsp; I pull the final rat.&nbsp; Check mana one last             time.&nbsp; Start typing, "/shout Charge. . ." boom. . .computer             freezes. . . Well, anyway, I logged in just in time to spend my             discipline on whooping Zland in the ass a few times.&nbsp; It was a             good victory for us though.&nbsp; Like I have been mentioning, we             lost a lot of people recently.&nbsp; We are in a re-building mode             right now.&nbsp; So to rally together and whoop Zland's ass with no             doubt that we were going to beat him made for a good night.</P>            <P align=left>Loot was the usual Zland Heart, Zland Talisman,             Frakadar Talisman, Gloves of Mortality.&nbsp;

No big corpses for             you to look at today.&nbsp; That doesn't mean we haven't been             busy.&nbsp; Spending more time in the Temple of Veeshan.&nbsp; Went             through the Halls of Testicles a couple times tonight.&nbsp; First             time we have seen the named drakes up in a week.&nbsp; Killed all             those poosae mo fakas again.&nbsp; But those quest items leave us             wondering, is this just Plane of Sky bank crap, Part II?&nbsp; We             really hope not.&nbsp; With the upcoming multi-quest nerf, our Halls             of Testing quest items could become the major, unlubed shaft of             century.&nbsp; Hoping to make that suck-ass, Dozekar, bite the dust             soon.&nbsp; I was really hoping we could try him tonight.&nbsp;             Unfortunately, as it always works, by the time we were ready to go             we had 26 in the zone, 4 of which were going LD on every pull.&nbsp;             We have a couple of strats up our sleeves for ol' Dozekar.&nbsp;             Can't wait to see what actually works.&nbsp; Of course, it's             profoundly disappointing that he does not deathtouch because we'd             love to send Desp in for that. . . </P>            <P align=left>So while we did not get many drops tonight, we did get             good drops.&nbsp;
