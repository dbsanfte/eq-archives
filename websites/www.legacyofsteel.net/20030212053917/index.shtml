12 of us were in PoFire doing a little xp and we noticed Fennin Ro was up
and needed to die (again) - we cleared a few mobs, asked a couple clerics
to come, cleared a few more mobs and it was go time, baby!  Three hours of
kiting later, Fennin Ro died and the obligatory asshole of necrii pets
spawned, who then summarily AE'd, aggro'd a shitload of guards and killed
us before I could get a good screenshot of the carnage and
drama.<p><center><img

in a day's work for the Evil Empire.<p><center><img
src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_03/02_05/pets.jpg><br>PS:
Fuck pets.</center><p>And as some of you heard about, I woke up late here
recently, and instead of using the trusty Mach3 (yes, I have two) to shave
my pubes, I thought, "What the fuck?", grabbed clippers instead and went
to work.<p>In a bit of pube shaving etiquette for you tomentose knuckle
draggers, you shave the pubes before a shower, so you can wash away any
traces left behind, but of course, before my shower I wasn't fully awake.  
This may or may not have contributed to the attendant risks placing the
equivlate to a gasoline powered set of hedge clippers near my pride and
joy were somehow acceptable for the admittedly modest increase in speed,
but that's for historians to decide - I'm a doer, blazing new trails in
the field of personal hygine and grooming.  Regardless, things are going
great and I'm giving serious consideration to the thought of switching to
the clippers full time, not to mention the bonus buzzing/vibrating aspect
and all at 6AM...<p>But I played with fire - on an errant pass to clean
things up, I got too close to the sack, and I found out suddenly that no
matter how well clippers might perform on smooth skin, the wrinkled bean
bag is a different story.  Just as groin transitions to sack, the clippers
gobbled it up like a thousand tiny teeth, rolling the meat up like an
angry peice of salt water taffy - I yelped like some wounded animal and
jerked back the whirling dervish instantly, but the damage had been done:
tiny nick perforations along a 1 inch section of sack welled up and
started to bleed, weeping blood to match my tears as I struggled to
quickly invent some half assed plausible story to tell the 911
operator.<p>I quickly grabbed some toilet paper and a styptic pencil, but
when I applied the chalk-like tip, it was like a white hot poker, and I
doubled over and squatted baseball style, bouncing involuntarily as my
testicles dangled and dribbled - bleeding, burning, above the cold
unyielding tile, as a fuzzy blue rug near the toilet taunting me in
unshorn glory.  That's okay asshole, I'll be pissing on you later.<p>I was
able to recover, and carefully mummified my balls to staunch the bleeding,
and mummified my cack while I was down there - if I had a marker I could
have written&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>U S A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;down the shaft
to have my own pocket rocket complete with armed warhead.  Again, I must
stress in my own defense, <i>I hadn't even had a shower yet - it all
seemed like a good idea.</i><p>After an interminable few minutes the fire
raging downstairs cooled, and I gently unwrapped to perform a damage
assessment - a long row of pin pricks with twin groves formed from the
blades gobbling up the unsuspecting loose skin.  I looked around for a
band-aid or anything to cover my junks up, but of course the only thing I
could find were the butterfly types used for finger joints.  Undeterred, I
slapped a pair on - only then did it hit me I still needed a shower.  To
give credit where credit is due, I must say the Johnson &amp; Johnson
folks really do make a fine waterproof skin adhesive which I have no doubt
has its uses, but this was the last thing I needed on my still-unshaven
sack.<p>Enter wounded animal yelping sound number two, a quick shower and
a Telfa pad with tape to wrap up my morning - literally - but I was
worried about that shit all day long as I got the thinking about it - I
didn't want to accidentally sit down wrong on my sack and eject a ball.  
I could just imagine a sound something akin to ripping a vinyl seat cover
as the little perforations let go and the distictive cartoon *pop* of
major injury and I'd be huddled in a corner trying to tucking things back
in after a blow out -while JB Weld is pretty good stuff, I don't think
it's approved for scrotal repair (yet).<p>Moral of the story: You can't
rush greatness.<p><font size=4><strong>Mezbreaker Parser v0.1
