Manalope ebayed his account.&nbsp; For complete details please check <A href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/16/technology/column_gaming/"><STRONG>this link</STRONG></A>.&nbsp; Of course we were horrified to learn that the Manalope we know and love is no more, that in fact we have been playing EQ with some Daddy Warbucks this whole time.&nbsp; CNN, the news source that of course can never be wrong, also confirmed that Manalope was responsible for the infamous "Cargelia Training Incedent" -- Cargelia, as CNN puts it, is that dragon in Western Wastes that never has SoW and never roams near SG.&nbsp; While CNN was hard at work ensuring their journalistic integrity, they also came across undeniable facts that link Manalope to the Al Queda terrorist network.&nbsp; It seems Manalope (or Osmanalope as his followers call him) came up with an elaborate money laundering program using Everquest and Ebay to fund terrorist operations on a world-wide scale.&nbsp; In a slightly related story CNN also announced that the Beatles in fact had FIVE (not the previously rumored 4) members -- John, Paul, George, Ringo and Manalope.&nbsp; We here at Legacy of Steel would like to thank CNN for proving just how much intergrity&nbsp;exists in the world of journalism these days.&nbsp; Without your hard work, CNN, we actually might have to all start thinking for ourselves someday.</P><P align=left>In other news, our new web site decided that it wanted to be like the old web site and took a nice hefty break from the online world this week.&nbsp; Well, I guess I have alot to update you on although I can't remember what was killed when, I just have some pictures and what not to keep you all happy while you get paid for reading a website at work which would cause your boss to fire your ass in 3 seconds if he knew you were reading it on his dime.</P><P align=left>We decided to kill this dude again, even if the beloved gimp pull to the zone no longer works.&nbsp;

Tha Hands of Mort.</P><P align=left>We also did the AC Ring last night which in case you did not know is officially called, <STRONG>The Ring of Torture</STRONG>.&nbsp; Other acceptable names include The Ring of Boredom or the Ring of Suck-Ass.&nbsp; Things were going peachy until, in the midst of Boss 6, 1 enchanter died due to the lag, another enchanter went LD and 2 clerics LD'd as well.&nbsp; So we cleared the ring and finished boss 6 with no problems.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/youhaveslain_underking.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>It sucks to have to stop the ring not because we can't handle the spawns, but because we can't handle the lag.&nbsp; Oh well, such is life in Everquest.</P><P align=left>Lastly, this week we also waxed Stanos so that <STRONG>Dorana</STRONG> could get her High Elf mask.&nbsp; You know spawn competition is tough when Stanos is dying. . .</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/dorana_hie.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>So hopefully the site manages to stay up for more than 24 hours in a row for once.&nbsp; If it does, I'll try to bring you more frequent updates.&nbsp; And please if the site does go down, feel free to NOT log in or post on our messageboards about it.&nbsp; And if you must send someone the obligatory, *Sup-bro-what's-up-with-the-site?* tells, send them to Crazz.&nbsp;

It seemed appropriate enough to return that fiesty bitch to the earth in the form of a face-down dirt nap.&nbsp; See, Tunare was spending her time charging for SoW's and ports, farming fishbone earrings and training others while Quad Kiting in Growth -- the typical druid bullshit.&nbsp; Rumor has it she was a mangina anyway, using her good looks along with a host of *teehees* and *huggles* to sucker poor saps into giving her phat lewtz.&nbsp; Either way, we took a *Mr. Garrison* approach to her exploits and decided, "The bitch must die."</P><P align=left>Many congrats to all who were present.&nbsp; Everyone showed great perserverence in taking her down.&nbsp; We had two attempts yesterday.&nbsp; After the first attempt we realized that we were doing something incredibly wrong.&nbsp; Being the tactical genius I am I came up with a new strat for try two:&nbsp; Everyone pull your head out of your ass this time.&nbsp; Amazingly, the strat seemed to work.&nbsp; According to my batphone sources VI is already at work nerfing this strat and will be patching all servers soon, returning most heads to the asses from which they came.&nbsp; They have alot of experience in that department.</P><P align=left>So the Scars of Velious have been scarred by LoS, from a_snow_bunny to the Avatar of War.&nbsp; The only safe refuge for mobs these days is in Luclin, behind locked doors with non-existent keys.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Dada's Art</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/dog.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Working As Intended</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/ssrae_bug.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/aowzloottable.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/hinamner.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/lesbianseahorse.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/mannalopeshors.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/rosebowl.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left>Adorean ponders the mystery that is ToV attendance. . . .</P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/adorean_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/crazz_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Desp's post-Tunare request:</P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/despim_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/jangos_Quote.jpg" border=0></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/line_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_14/rhap_quote.jpg" border=0></P><a name="newsitem1010649600,39574,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>If I Get Up Before Daylight I Just Might Get Some Sleep </strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, January 10, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>Back In Business In a Big Way</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG>Site Up -- AoW DOWN</STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_10/berton_aow.jpg" border=0></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_10/aow_Dead_1_9.jpg" border=0></STRONG></P><P align=left>Once again, masters of disasters <STRONG>Legacy of Steel</STRONG> and our good friends <A href="http://www.shockofswords.com"><STRONG>Shock of Swords</STRONG> </A>bring you the <STRONG>Avatar of War</STRONG>, face down and dead as dead gets.&nbsp; This was in essence a "pick-up" AoW raid.&nbsp; On previous attempts, SoS and LoS planned the dates and times carefully for our AoW assassinations.&nbsp; Tonight we finished up our raiding early and caught wind that the Statue (which we were told was killed the night before) was in fact up.&nbsp; So we head to Kael and I send Durck a tell, Come kill AoW.&nbsp; Durck responds, NOW?&nbsp; A short while later we're taking screenshots and enjoying our AoW phat l3wtz.&nbsp; What can I say, this is the fourth AoW we've killed now and it still feels damned good to see him drop each time -- that magic of killing something that can easily wipe you out cannot be beat in EQ.</P><P align=left>Sooooooooo our fucking website. . .don't even ask me what the problem is.&nbsp; All I know is welcome to the new home of Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; So much has happened that this update is going to be a big fucking mess of old and useless information.&nbsp; Before I get too deep into it, I must post the most CLASSIC picture you will see.&nbsp; There is only one title that suits the picture you are about to lay your eyes upon and that title was coined by none other than Homer Simpson himself, "DOH!"</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_10/tormax_serverdown.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><STRONG>DOH!</STRONG></P><P align=left>In case you were wondering, we killed him and were able to loot two Horns and a pair of boots.&nbsp; The boots and one horn made it back after the patch -- one horn and the head were however lost forever in the world of Poof!&nbsp; Poof -- something SoL has acquainted us with rather nicely.</P><P align=left>Speaking of SoL we have been having some entirely shitty luck with random poofs, shitty drops and all sorts of bugs and what not.&nbsp; Still, we're having fun and ripping shit up.&nbsp; Well, actually, this guy destroyed us tonight:</P><P align=center><STRONG><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_10/exiled_sword.jpg" border=0></STRONG></P><P align=left>Dual wielding mo faka is just a prison rapist -- we died and he had NO red left in his hp bar -- gg us fux up.&nbsp;

God knows I can't sleep until I have 234905832405 AC and 2345789235 HP.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_10/merc_vulak.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>So I am supposed to be ranting about some SoL stuff but the truth is I am still pumped from that AoW kill and I am fucking-A tired right now.&nbsp; Well wait, I can rant a little bit.&nbsp; Ok how should we start this one.&nbsp; I know let's talk about Verant and maximizing the time of their expansion.&nbsp; Let's face it, VI needs this expansion to last a good long while.&nbsp; So what do they do?&nbsp; They add keys to get to uber mobs, thus slowing down the *discovery* of Luclin.&nbsp; That I can understand.&nbsp; In fact I like that notion.&nbsp; It seperated the men from the boys in Kunark with VP keys, and likewise proved who had their shit together in SoV with Sleepers.&nbsp; But in Luclin it seems, rather than having keys drop off of HARD mobs (a.k.a. EARNING your key to the next step), keys seem to be RARE drops off of RARE spawns -- thereby rewarding the Lucky and Unemployed.&nbsp; Now to add to this retarded idea of RARE drops (rather than drops off of HARD mobs) you have all you gimps out there who decided to passover the necessary *key* step to get to uber mobs and you fuckers exploited the doors.&nbsp; Well congrats on your awesome EQ FIRST, dumbasses, and as a result of your ub3r l33tn3ss Mages get a big phat dick in the ass nerf of CoH.&nbsp; And when CoH gets nerfed is it just the mages that get punished? Oh no, it's everyone.&nbsp; Stuck in traffic on the way home to a raid?&nbsp; Tough shit -- not there on time, you're fucked.&nbsp; Good fucking going exploiting dumbasses and good fucking going Verant for not having half a clue that if you put locked doors in people are gonna get past them.&nbsp; Here's an idea VI -- rather than nerf mages, how bout you go check on who's killing mobs behind locked doors -- look at their loot -- then see who has key.&nbsp; No key?&nbsp; Conquest their ass.&nbsp; Don't fuck the rest of us over because some lazy gimps can sploit a door.&nbsp; And for crying out loud, put keys on HARD mobs -- not rare drops on rare spawns.&nbsp; Are you looking to reward the skilled players or the lucky and unemployed?</P><P align=left>Speaking of bullshit, no fun keys, we did Griegs the other day.&nbsp; Wow, that zone can suck a phat cack.&nbsp; Rhap sums it up best:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_10/rhap_greigs.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>The novelty of Grieg's wears off in about 2 minutes.&nbsp; Add to that I dragged 30 people there to kill some raid mobs, and we get the big phat shaft on the key there as well. Weeeeeeee so much fun.&nbsp; Maybe I am a tad bitter because the day before we were doing the AC ring and had the 5th and 6th boss both spawn us at once -- that was fun.&nbsp; After wiping out to that, we started the ring again, kill the 4th boss and POOF! Script over!&nbsp; Weeeeeeeeeeeee.&nbsp; SoL beta testing at its best.&nbsp; Oh, I mentioned Grieg -- forgot to tell you we managed to get him to spawn in Ssrae -- I think it's part of some larger SoL Quest:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_10/veneficus_grieg_ssrae.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Later, I saw Grieg in AC so I guilded him:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_10/veneficus_grieg_los.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Other than that we've all been working on AA skills.&nbsp; Metabolism and Charisma are the guild standard priorities.&nbsp; And if you're really bored in your exp group, pull Mr. Rumble:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_10/rumblecrush.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>That was fun for some laughs.&nbsp; No, killing Rumblecrush is not much a feat in the world of EQ but doing it with your exp group is fun and by posting this here I just saved 2000 people from having to read some Numbnut's "RUMBLECRUSH DOWN!" post on the Nameless Tavern.</P><P align=left>Goddamn I am tired.&nbsp;
