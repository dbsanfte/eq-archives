It'd been a war of attrition all night for what was an impromptu raid to begin, but did we give up when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!  We never were never really good with leaving well enough alone anyhow, so even with only 38 people and 4.5 clerics left, there was no question that bastard was going down.<p><center><img

mana, we pulled off an awesome win - I was really proud of the focus we displayed, but more importantly, we were enjoying playing and had fun, a rare experience in VT and indicative of SoL on the whole to be honest, but this was textbook late-night LoS, not some really bad Cinderella story we all turn into giant sucking pussies at the stroke of midnight (that was Monday and Tuesday - don't know what you’ve got 'till it's gone).<p>Saturday was sporadic pick group raiding when quests got finished and half elf masks KS'd err camped, and Sunday was another big follow up round in VT with the ambiguously gay Xankra's getting the last laugh when we foolishly expected real loot not shit on a stick - but no matter, the weekend was a total blast.<p><center><img

dick, hunting it out and finding every conceivable manner to mouth cock - thankfully we've done the opposite, starting with the new UI patch (more later) and have taken advantage of Nameless going up and down like Voronwe on a boyscout:<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/hp.jpg><p><img

finally got back to having fun, and so what if Desp shows up or we have an alarmingly high number of Canadians and even a few fuckin Euros in the guild?  We take the good with the bad and <p>Hot dammit.<p>Fuck<p>FUCK<p>Shit<p>...Sigh<p>Okay.<p>I just thought about that abortion of a zone known as VT and my enthusiasm withered away like an erection when a stray memory of your old 5th grade teacher bending over your desk to yell at you and you inadvertently saw down her blouse, witness, no - victim to gruesome wrinkled flesh, the repugnant odor of sickly sweet hair spray and White Linen perfume flooding your nose, palatable and gagging your senses in some horrific synesthesia of repulsion and prepubescent curiosity flashes through your mind OH WHY GOD WHY IS THIS BURNED INTO MY MIND?!  <p>So like, I hate that fucking place and WE SHALL MAKE NO MENTION OF THE ABOVE EVER AGAIN.  Surprisingly, we've also done very well in VT, too.  I'll admit learning a new zone is probably one of the best things in EQ - sure loot is nice and so are flawless victories, but going in and seeing shit for yourself, earning your wins and getting L59 the hard way are the best rewards - don't get me wrong, the guild flirted a few times with dick and I think snuck in a few quick bj's with your random wipe outs, burning Vox stick charges on Eyes, &c. - but regrouping and wailing the hell out of DXXT then killing TVK on the first try (not to mention in the room we killed him in jejeje) seemed to redeem early faux pas like res'ing a fucking beastmaster before me (assholes).<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/dxxt.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/dxxt-hm.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/tvk-hm.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/ktxad.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/orb_loot.gif> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/mantle_loot.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/gloves_loot.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/pendant_loot.gif> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/bracelet_loot.gif></center><p><p>Finally, I just can't let this go,<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/smed_quote.gif><p>Hey Smed - first off, 30k of the 100k are in the fucking bazaar - how about fixing that shit so the frame rate approaches playable - it's not going to get better with time, k?  The /bazaar window is great - since you've removed some of the former hardcore RP tethers, how about adding a BUY button to the item stats when we right click on it, let us browse the merchant window when we right click the trader's name and then you can hide the player's sprite to alleviate the raft of level 2 naked high elf traders clambering for a spot under the canopy - the bazaar looks like a fucking concentration camp - IS VI ANTI-SEMETIC IN ADDITION TO <a href=http://www.tritonguild.com/archives.php?id=130>BEING</a> <a href=http://www.tritonguild.com/images/news/22July2002/orbofsecrets.GIF>RACIST</a>?<p>But seriously - EQ has a lot of problems right now, and quiet frankly it's insulting for you to blithely go on like you were accepting a fucking Oscar while turning a deaf ear and dumb mouth to legitimate concerns voiced by your knowledgeable player base.  If the master plan is to string this pig together with duct tape and bullshit with the promise of PoP until EQ2 is launched, then say so - but if that "community" spiel you guys give every so few months or so when the natives get restless is real then get off your podium and get to work - this is the promise land calling.<p><font size=4><strong>Mauldlinalope</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/duels.jpg><p>Unban Manalope, please.<p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p>God bless the new UI and xserver tells - except for a few of your cocksuckers who tried to crash me (didn't work - new UI sucks ass for bards so I still use the old one TEE HEE), I've really enjoyed both... if only VI would make reply/afk work with the xserver shit I'd like it ever more.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/xserver-stalkers_quote.gif><p>Of course, dodging GMs and the namefilter is the true measure of stalker success~<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/bis_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/cen_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/despass_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/krion_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/mam_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/stalk_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/rich_quote.gif><p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/gullem_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/roiujil_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/tig_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/vene_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/sav_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/rey_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/jan-merc_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/raz_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/gal_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/berton_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/jangos_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/voro_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/august_02/8_02/teamice_quote.gif><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body><a name="newsitem1027726030,32696,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>They Do It All The Time</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Friday, July 26, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork_dropbox@yahoo.com">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>Yay</strong></font></center><p>So LoS has taken it's first serious foray into VT and what can I say?

Sorry, I really can't write anymore that won't sound suspiciously like whining.<p>LoS has and will have fun in VT, we're always like that, and personally I'm glad we can go in there with a return to our usual 40-50 tight nit crew - but it won't be because of the content.<p>Anyhow, we killed some nondescript mobs and got some nice stuff.

I waited a while to see what the response would be to <strong>the fucking ninja IM nerf on bards you cocksuckers didn't have the sack to mention in the patch message</strong>, and predictably, Alan came trotting out with this horseshit:<p><i><dd>I’m sorry for not catching this in the patch message.  Basically because this <dd>was the way it was always intended to be, we were not aware that we’d fixed a bug.</i><p>Save the fucking excuses I know are coming, the ones where you say code got pushed before it was ready (no shit, we all brought SoL - we KNOW that routine), and please, after *9* months you're "fixing a bug" and don't feel the need to mention it?  You want to fix a bug?  Go fix procs and bard songs, go fix frame rates in the bazaar so it doesn't look like characters pop and lock like a Mitsubishi commercial - oh wait, you never fucking thought 750 people would be in the bazaar at once?<p>*shocked*<p>Hey, why don't you guys down in the Brain Trust just admit you have <strong>no fucking clue</strong> about bards, not in how they work, not in how they are played - and is painfully obvious, certainly not the code - and save me and the rest of the bard community from having a fucking aneurysm every patch day for shit you break, intentionally or simply due to ignorance and incompetence (or more likely, some unholy triumvirate).  <p>But I'm not trying to veer too far off course, we're talking about you guys clearly giving us the fucking shaft.  I'm not trying to get other classes nerfed, hell, I love that manaburn works so well and is 5 pts - it's a great tool, same with escape - at 9 pts we have tremendous recovery from dumbass mistakes (we're pretty good at those - oh, in a totally unrelated issue, if you have a Vox stick to sell, send Abru a tell)... but IM3 at 18 pts didn't by ANY means bring us up to where we should and need to be, but it helped a good deal - even if we're still slaved to our epic.  Then this fucking piece of work patch comes along - Cong bards, another 18 pts later and we can have SM3 but still be in the red.  No offense (I've already called you cocksuckers, but let's let bygones be bygones), but what the fuck were you guys thinking?<p>Never fear, I'm not here to just rant, I'm here to help:<p><ol><li>Remove head from ass</li><li>Go to the boards - read the well documented issues</li><li>Solicit input - note some whining bastards who can't form a sentence without the word fuck still have a point</li><li>Get your design team and your programmers together - help them with number 1</li><li>Go over the fucking problems</li><li>FIX SHIT - if someone says it's too hard to fix or code, start firing people</li><li>Go back to the boards - read the feedback</li><li>Repeat as necessary - by the time you start looking for a number 8, I'll have something witty, insightful and hopefully without the word fuck (no promises).</ol><p>I get all worked up about this shit, but I'm trying to calm down - please, email me at <a href=mailto:tork_dropbox@yahoo.com?Subject=we%20have%20no%20clue%20about%20bards%20-%20help!>tork_dropbox@yahoo.com</a>, check <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall>TCH</a> - I don't care, do something or you risk losing the support of your most cohesive and tolerant player base community.<p><font size=4><strong>Bad Idea Jeans</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/hen1_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/vhar1_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/pow_quote.gif><p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/cho_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/evil_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/mar_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/ple_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/rust_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/tal_quote.gif><p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><br><font size=3><strong><i>Asshole of Guild</i> Edition</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/amu-hen.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/amu_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/jan_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/gul_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/rhap_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/vene_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/ber_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_26/tig-hen_quote.gif><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body>
