We get better at this war each time and last night was a truly amazing effort by all those involved.&nbsp; I want to express a sincere thank you to <A href="http://www.shockofswords.com/">Shock of Swords </A>for bringing a few groups to help out.&nbsp; I also want to thank all the guests in the zone who stayed not just to watch but to put forth their best efforts to help us win as well.&nbsp; Everyone there made a huge difference and all the help was greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Look forward to seeing you all in Great Divide again real soon.&nbsp; That is, if you don't crash trying to zone in. . .</P><P align=left>On another note, we had top secret plans to off Tunare this week.&nbsp; I zone into Plane of Growth with my sloot-twink to check out what spawns were up and was horrified when I saw this:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_1/tunare.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Ok VI foolmans. . . .Tunare had weaps that could be disarmed, right?&nbsp; How about just removing those weaps?&nbsp; Or do you have to /kill the freakin mob?&nbsp; There isn't much left to kill, amigos.&nbsp; Each day that "free day" appears on the schedule we seem to lose 2-3 to DAoC or windows pinball or masturbation or anything more exciting than EQ with no uber mobs.&nbsp; Maybe it's time to think about increasing some spawn times?&nbsp; Or how about just not being retards and making sure mobs like Tunare are ready to kill 1 year after an expansion comes out?&nbsp; Or did you think we were all gonna camp Stormfeather and let Tunare live?&nbsp; The game is called EverQUEST not EverTEST.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_3/aowsmommy.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_3/bitiestigole.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_3/frozennjesu.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_3/stallionnuts.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_3/tigolesenior.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_3/tigzbish.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Misdirected Conversation of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left>To give some background, Makochan is a Wizard from LoS.&nbsp;

We just can't get enough.&nbsp; The day before yesterday we only killed Eashen, Aaryonar, Feshlak, Dagarn, Kriezen, Koi'Doken and Lady Mirenilla.&nbsp; So we were well rested from such an easy, relaxing night before we just HAD to put a whooping on ToV when patch day rolled around.&nbsp; I don't think it's appropriate for me to call the Temple of Veeshan the Home of LoS anymore.&nbsp; I think Summer Cottage is more appropriate. . .we just don't spend enough time there =P</P><P align=left>It's that time of the update where I post some *new* Vulak loot.&nbsp;

Hobart's War HELMET (key word HELMET) has no f'ing graphic!!!

The war is terrific fun.&nbsp; We had a ton of people show up to help us out and to them I am very grateful.&nbsp; Everyone in the zone was working as a team and it was a great feeling seeing things go so smoothly.&nbsp; Unfortunately, even though we *won* the war, Narandi got away.&nbsp; I had the mo faka agro'd, took his Harm Touch, but got just out of his agro range and he ran off to EW.&nbsp; Needless to say it was a VERY lame ending to what was shaping up to be an awesome night.&nbsp; Everyone was very let down.&nbsp; After all, we killed all the giants and Narandi was next on the list.&nbsp; It's not like we didn't engage Narandi either. . .oh well.</P><P align=left>Anyway, the true reason I like the Ring War is it gives me a chance to Roleplay, the true reason I play Everquest:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_1/ringwar_rp.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>In my continuing efforts to keep this webpage cutting edge, I am introducing yet another feature to the site.&nbsp;
