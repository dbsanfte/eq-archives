This may or may not have contributed to the attendant risks placing the equivlate to a gasoline powered set of hedge clippers near my pride and joy were somehow acceptable for the admittedly modest increase in speed, but that's for historians to decide - I'm a doer, blazing new trails in the field of personal hygine and grooming.  Regardless, things are going great and I'm giving serious consideration to the thought of switching to the clippers full time, not to mention the bonus buzzing/vibrating aspect and all at 6AM...<p>But I played with fire - on an errant pass to clean things up, I got too close to the sack, and I found out suddenly that no matter how well clippers might perform on smooth skin, the wrinkled bean bag is a different story.  Just as groin transitions to sack, the clippers gobbled it up like a thousand tiny teeth, rolling the meat up like an angry peice of salt water taffy - I yelped like some wounded animal and jerked back the whirling dervish instantly, but the damage had been done: tiny nick perforations along a 1 inch section of sack welled up and started to bleed, weeping blood to match my tears as I struggled to quickly invent some half assed plausible story to tell the 911 operator.<p>I quickly grabbed some toilet paper and a styptic pencil, but when I applied the chalk-like tip, it was like a white hot poker, and I doubled over and squatted baseball style, bouncing involuntarily as my testicles dangled and dribbled - bleeding, burning, above the cold unyielding tile, as a fuzzy blue rug near the toilet taunting me in unshorn glory.  That's okay asshole, I'll be pissing on you later.<p>I was able to recover, and carefully mummified my balls to staunch the bleeding, and mummified my cack while I was down there - if I had a marker I could have written&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>U S A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;down the shaft to have my own pocket rocket complete with armed warhead.  Again, I must stress in my own defense, <i>I hadn't even had a shower yet - it all seemed like a good idea.</i><p>After an interminable few minutes the fire raging downstairs cooled, and I gently unwrapped to perform a damage assessment - a long row of pin pricks with twin groves formed from the blades gobbling up the unsuspecting loose skin.  I looked around for a band-aid or anything to cover my junks up, but of course the only thing I could find were the butterfly types used for finger joints.  Undeterred, I slapped a pair on - only then did it hit me I still needed a shower.  To give credit where credit is due, I must say the Johnson &amp; Johnson folks really do make a fine waterproof skin adhesive which I have no doubt has its uses, but this was the last thing I needed on my still-unshaven sack.<p>Enter wounded animal yelping sound number two, a quick shower and a Telfa pad with tape to wrap up my morning - literally - but I was worried about that shit all day long as I got the thinking about it - I didn't want to accidentally sit down wrong on my sack and eject a ball.  I could just imagine a sound something akin to ripping a vinyl seat cover as the little perforations let go and the distictive cartoon *pop* of major injury and I'd be huddled in a corner trying to tucking things back in after a blow out -while JB Weld is pretty good stuff, I don't think it's approved for scrotal repair (yet).<p>Moral of the story: You can't rush greatness.<p><font size=4><strong>Mezbreaker Parser v0.1 Alpha!</strong></font><p>Courtesy of Veneficus Noriega, Cartel Master of Neriak,<p>Ever wonder just how many mez breaks we get in one night and don't feel like counting all that "has been awoken by *asshole mez breaker*" messages on your screen?

I'm not hallucinating black helicopters, these assholes freely admitted doing it, and not just in PoTact - they know just as well as we do the GM's won't respond to petitions, /reports, &c.  I guess I'm glad RZ is back up, since some people got fucked out of legit flags and I want to help them get on with PoP, but it still sucks ass this rampant zone crashing continues - TEE HEE!<p>All said, though, I'm impressed LoS was able to turn the corner on a night when we had every reason to just say piss on it and log - I'll admit it's been fucking frustrating to lose in nearly every conceivable suck dick way, but it's also an opportunity to further my research.<p>Let me explain:  Have you ever found an experience that left you physically and mentally drained in a bad way, such as arguing with the return desk at Wal Mart?  Have you listened to a TV infomercial and thought, 'I am getting fucking dumber by the minute' before unconsciously drooling on yourself as you reached for the phone to order?  Well, bad news:  it's not just your imagination, it's a real, and most cases, permanent, loss of intelligence.  I don't mean to alarm anyone, but if some of you lose a few more brain cells to this infectious stupidity, you're at risk of becoming talking chimps.  In fact, this applies to a troublingly large segment of the population, which is why I am trying to quantify the effects of stupidity, known clinically as "fucking retarded" - especially mass stupidity writ large.<p>I feel this is going to be some ground breaking work, and while there is no cure, perhaps this will be the watershed event eventually spawning treatment (such as self-sterilization).  I'll share some of my preliminary findings at this time, and continue to collect data from my band of retards in the mist.<p><ul><li><strong>Retardation seems to require a specific activation energy.</strong><br>Saving a lecture in chemistry, in some cases extremely favorable reagents may be mixed together, but reaction not immediately take place due to a lack of energy to initiate the process - for example gasoline and oxygen will not combust without the spark.  That added heat is known as the activation energy, and a rough analog exists in retardation.  Individually, any one action of retardation can be tolerated by its surrounds reasonably well and without infecting others.  These actions go by many names: a joke, horseplay, slacking, attentionboss, a joke, testing, false claims of literacy, but once those individual occurrences being to stack up, an activated complex stirs, building and growing; a precipitous foreplay for the stupid which cannot be rushed, but yet not fully realizing its own potential until the activation energy, <i><strong>E</strong><sub>aRETARDATION</i></sub>, is achieved.  Once, however, sufficient energy, has been added to reaction, things been to inexorably proceed:<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_19/cp-t.png><br>Figure 1: Clusterfuck Potential Vs Time, <i><strong>E</strong><sub>aRETARDATION</i></sub> noted</center></li><p><li><strong>Retardation varies with distance to next closest retard.</strong><br>Closely related to attraction in electricity and magnetism, retardation grows stronger as subjects draw nearer to one another, often subconsciously seeking one another out in a slow but accelerating dance, perhaps drawn in by mouth breathing signals, circling with a steady spiral of increasing retardation which ultimately leads to the first seed of active stupidity.  As noted in Figure 2, even a relatively small degree of separation can stave off otherwise sufficient <i><strong>E</strong><sub>aRETARDATION</i></sub>, which would explain the natural flocking retards exhibit, and an affinity for unnecessarily hugging nuts.  The most pronounced increase appears to be due to self explanatory Intrazone Tidal Retard Effect (ITRE).<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_19/r-d.png><br>Figure 2: Retardation Vs Distance, ITRE noted</center></li><p><li><strong>Retardation increases with population size.</strong><br>Yes, this sounds intuitive, but there's something deeper, insidious, at work here in a non-obvious manner.  Stupidity can exist individually, but in its purest form - the committee - its power shines with the brilliance of the sun, and that light of warms the faces of the masses, awaking the inner retard.  In a vicious cycle, the collective intelligence of <s>Legac</s> <strong>people</strong> steadily declines with population size once <i><strong>E</strong><sub>aRETARDATION</i></sub> has been achieved and the critical mass formed, quickly sucking in and enveloping the herd, until doing something like Vex Thal seems a good idea.<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_19/r-ps.png><br>Figure 3: Retardation Vs Population Size</center></li><p><li><strong>Retardation often spawns drama.</strong><br>Duh - and by "Duh" I mean there's a really witty paragraph which should go here, but I fucked up and hit Ctrl+C instead of Ctrl+V when editing and don't feel like rewriting it.

I'll be honest, I was struggling with what all to write about, but thankfully VI came through for me with a simply brainless patch a few days ago.  More later, I need to let the hate and vitrol steep.<p>Okay, I waited long enough.<p>First off, let's examine the level 63 bard AA, Boastful Bellow, not be confused with our L12 song of the same name - gogo Creative Design Team.  For the uninitiated, it was designed as a means to tag mobs - it was insta-cast and did 1-50 damage, randomly, and could 0-sec stun (interrupt) creatures L60 and under, which at L63+, amounts to moss snakes in SRO.  The ability had a 18 second recast, and was of moderate MR resist given its two components.  All that was incidental to simply tagging a mob for aggro, something bellow excelled at - what bellow did not do, however, was make a check for distance or line of sight, and to boot, was usable under circumstances not ordinarily possible, most notably invis and DA.  Having said that, please read on, lest you jump to the same rash conclusions VI did with the knee jerk asinine nerf that follows.<p>If you're not familiar with aggro and pulling, for a tagged mob to deviate from its normal behavior, be it wandering or static, the person aggro, must be in the chase radius of a mob - this has been the case since RoK, so any sort of fears, for example, about a bard tagging from across the zone and having the mob come solo aren't valid - oh, how I dreamed of getting Trak to the IZ during prime time... but no one levels there anymore and I digress.<p>I can fully accept unlimited range wasn't intended, and the things I've done tagging through invis or DA have been very ccc, but VI's answer was to nerf the ability down to an 18-second recast spell, with 200 range and to require line of sight, without ever once thinking why it was in its original ability form.  Let it soak in: 8 AA points for 0-50 damage every 18 seconds at 200 range - wtf? I'm not sure what prompted such a severe nerf, but in its current form, that's simply brainless - the retardedery is overwhelming.  <p>And yes, I'm very pissed off.<p>What's really the kicker is how insulting it is VI again doesn't have the sack to mention such a big nerf in the patch message - there were fucking press releases and paid counseling sessions for the bereaved when they nerfed manaburn not nearly so hardcore as bellow, for Christ's sake...  or maybe, just maybe, VI just forgot about bards, <strong>again</strong>, eh, Absor? I dunno what the case it, you tell us.<p>Glad I have throwing max'd, but since I chose wood elf, I can't use those 250 range javelins designed for monks never meant to have long range attacks. That's good though, because I don't want to use javelins, and I don't want a token increase in range to 250 - I don't want to think I spent 2+6=8 AA's to get a few hundred plat worth of free ammo.  I don't want a points refund either - I want VI to fix the ability.  More to the point, for 8 AA points, this tagging/pulling tool only available after L63 ought to be extremely useful; as has been pointed out, as you must be in chase range for the mob to come in RoK/SoV/SoL/PoP, the range issue was not an exploitive pulling mechanism. <p>Anyhow, ideally, I'd ask bellow to be restored to its original form, but I'm trying to give up my crack habit, so instead, I'd grudgingly accept bellow as a 3/3/3 <strong>ability</strong>, scaling with 200/300/400 range - and <strong>not</strong> as a spell.  Bellow should not be usable while DA, and it should break invis - sorry Selo's 51 pullers, get DMF or use your SS boots.  At 2+3+3+3=11 AA points total, if anything, we'd be paying too much for a knee jerk stealth nerf that really shouldn't have happened, but at least we'd have a usable tool back.<p>Since I've whined this much, I might as keep on rolling with it (since we haven't killed anything of note recently due to a wonderfully <strong>buggy RZ script</strong> on Nameless - I guess sometime after the 9th TZ you just have to give it up for the night - I love how the guides won't promote a problem to GM staff after not one, but three guilds petition daily for weeks, too), which brings us to bard Elemental armor.<p>Don't get me wrong, the stats are great, and I'm not even going to bitch about the effects, even if they are gimp in comparison to right click avatar and oh yah, I want my flowing thought back.  No, what I'm concerned about is the apparent path VI's taking as a way to uncouple bards from their epic, which has been surgically attached to the off hand since RoK.  The epic, with its 16/26 ratio, was nice then, but 3 expansions later, it's showing its age.  The only reason bards continue to use the item is the instrument (all) and singing modifier bonus conferred to songs - to lose that would be a tremendous blow in terms of song efficacy, not to mention the automatic check for instrument-required songs.  The upgrade path VI has finally chosen is to place an identical instrument type (percussion, string, &c.) or singing mod on individual pieces of armor.  This looks good on paper given how nice the armor's stats are, but taking the long view, instead of being slaved to one piece of gear in the offhand, bards become tied to many pieces of gear in at least 5 armor slots.  With the rumored expansion(s) still to come, and no one having fully exploring the drop tables for the elemental planes, let alone entered Time, how much worse off will things be?<p>Answer: lots.<p>What shows another glaring unfamiliarity and/or discontinuity between the EQ teams is the bard PoP AA Ayonae's Tutelage, which allows the max song mod softcap to be increased - yet with identical song mods on new equipment as the epic, hitting the RoK song cap remains impossible except under 2 narrow circumstances - one of which involves the use of a 2 minute duration, 72 minute recycle disciple.  So uhm... yeah.  Don't even get me started on Extended Notes.<p>So what would I do?  I'm so glad you asked.<p>I personally reject the most common suggestion I see floating around, that of allowing the epic to go in the range slot - you're still binding bards to a piece/set of equipment to be balanced, breaking one of the core rules of gaming in my book.  What I'd perfer seeing is a well thought out quest to unlock a hidden set of Masteries, call it Mastery of Voice, Percussion, Wind, String, Brass at 3 AA's each for an epic level mod, and once completed, something like Puretone to allow the bard to use songs normally requiring an instrument without such - for those keeping score at home, that's 18 AA points total.  Each expansion, starting with PoP, would then use Ayonae's (Advanced, and so forth) Tutelage to increase both the mod and softcap across the board on par for that expansion.  By freeing up the devs and the players from the onus and imposition of *required* bard specific items, it's a win-win situation all concerned. <p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-ana_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-big_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-conten_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-droo_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-hog_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-lil_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-orules_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-purple_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-rz_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-scra_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-tea_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-tigp_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-tiggol_quote.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-ulta_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-wet_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-wou_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/s-wuwu_quote.png><p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/q-gul_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/q-jan_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/q-kae_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/q-kore_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/q-parv_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_03/01_11/q-rey_quote.png><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body>
