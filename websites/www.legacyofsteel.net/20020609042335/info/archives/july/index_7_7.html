            <P align=left>Last night was fan-fucking-tastic. We absolutely 
            ripped through Sleepers.&nbsp; Our goal was to find the elusive mob 
            called <STRONG>Z-Axis</STRONG>. . .we needed to try Dictate on him, 
            lifetap for slow.&nbsp; We all had our Res Effects buffs in place 
            but Z-Axis never spawned.&nbsp; Instead, we decided to destroy the 
            Warders of Sleepers Tomb.&nbsp; This was our first chance actually 
            seeing them up.&nbsp; Previously we had a bunch of !placeholders to 
            contend with.&nbsp; </P>
            <P align=left>So we kill the Final Arbitor and we were sitting 
            around buffing up for our next fight.&nbsp; Leick and I both notice 
            that flying gargoyle that roams between the Warders so Leick tells 
            me, "Grab it, Tig."&nbsp; Being the fantastic noobie moron I am (you 
            really need to get to know me to appreciate just what a n00b I can 
            be) I shoot my l33t Adarra's Bow at him.&nbsp; Of course, rather 
            than the Garg turning and coming to attack me, he takes off in the 
            other direction toward Nanzata the Warder.&nbsp; Cue Dueling Banjos 
            as the Halfling goes down.&nbsp; So that's how we decided which 
            Warder to kill first.&nbsp; That prick cacksugging mo faka beeotch 
            Nanzata had to die.</P>

            <P align=center><STRONG><EM>Always fun killing a mob on your first 
            attempt. . .</EM></STRONG></P>
            <P align=left>The next Warder looked like Silverwing so we just knew 
            he had to be a big phat poosae.&nbsp; His name was Tukaarak or 
            something like that.&nbsp; Ol' Tupac died on the first try as 
            well:</P>

            deathtouches, so little time. . .</EM></STRONG></P>
            <P align=left>The last warder we took down was 
            <STRONG>Hraashna</STRONG>.&nbsp; Hraashna absolutely destroyed us on 
            our first attempt.&nbsp; We had very little knowledge as to what 
            sort of strat to use against him.&nbsp; We just kinda saw the dude 
            and went for it.&nbsp; Needless to say we learned a lot.&nbsp; What 
            happened next was pure magic.&nbsp; Keep in mind we had 26 people in 
            Sleepers.&nbsp; We ressed up, came up with a kick-ass strat and beat 
            Hraashna in what, if I dare say, might have been one of our crowning 
            moments.&nbsp; With 26 people this was not a matter of "Press A" and 
            hope for the best.&nbsp; Every single person in there was on the 
            exact same page.&nbsp; He might not be the toughest mob in EQ but 
            with the raid force we had it was a fantastic challenge and an even 
            greater victory.</P>
            <P align=left>Ok. . .yea, yea, yea, Tig, shut the fuck up, 
            right?&nbsp; This is Everquest. . .we only care about loot.</P>
            <P align=left>Here's some of the stuff we picked up:</P>

            <P align=left>The main score was picking up 3 Primal Warswords and a 
            Priceless Bow.&nbsp; By the way, if someome from VI ever wants to 
            log onto The Nameless and discuss what TO DO and what NOT TO DO as 
            far as caster loot goes, I'll be happy to show you those piece of 
            shit staves in my inventory as examples.&nbsp; The mask up there 
            isn't so bad.&nbsp; In fact it's nicer than anything I wear.&nbsp; 
            But c'mon foolmans. . .what's with the Schwag Staves?&nbsp; Didn't 
            you learn your lesson with Venril Sathir?</P>
            <P align=left>Here's <STRONG>Parv</STRONG> with his badass new 
            sword:</P>

            <P align=left>Oh yea, we also picked up two of these gems:</P>

            <P align=left>Cast that on your Halflings and you get yourself 3 
            feet of pure whoopass:</P>

            <P align=left>So, after all that ST I was gonna have the most ub9r 
            version of Mort &amp; Gage, Uber Bankers ever.&nbsp; But I was bound 
            in Freeport.&nbsp; That cacksugger banker in Freeport said the usual 
            like of "Um, I am a dumb fucking fee-ack and don't know what to do 
            with this other than sit and spin" instead of naming the item.&nbsp; 
            So you'll all have to cheel out till I get my lazy ass back to Thurg 
            for some banking fun.</P>
            <P align=left>Oh after ST 33 of us went and lost to Cazic.&nbsp; I 
            was too tired to deal.&nbsp; We got him to C.&nbsp; Then I bitched 
            and moaned like a whiney schoolgirl and went to bed, leaving my 
            guild to think of me as the cranky, whiney bitch I truly am.</P>
