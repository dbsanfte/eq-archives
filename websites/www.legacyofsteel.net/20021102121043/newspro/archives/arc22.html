POOF.&nbsp; He vanishes.&nbsp; Then he is back on his spawn point, full hp, and summoning people.&nbsp; So we pull him back to the group and have to kill him&nbsp;again.&nbsp; To tell you the truth killing two Glyphed in a row, with no pause, back-to-back was a really fun fight.&nbsp; I wonder if that is "working as intended" as well.&nbsp; Fucking buggy ass zone.&nbsp; Oh, here's that dagger:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_25/windspeeder.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>At first we're pretty excited.&nbsp; After all, the dagger would be pretty sweet.&nbsp; Then we notice it's OFFHAND only.&nbsp; To add insult to injury the HASTE is a fucking PROC that lasts 18 seconds (18 mo faka seconds?).&nbsp; ROFL.&nbsp; Yay, more useless loot.&nbsp; And p.s. VI I bitched about too much monk loot because I wanted CLERIC and CASTER loot -- not 10 million fucking daggers.&nbsp; What is with the uber goddamn weapons on Rhag 1 -- the biggest poosae in all of Norrath???&nbsp; Jesus Christ you guys give new definition to the phrase "knee-jerk" -- sheesh.&nbsp; Save the uber weapons for the uber mobs (p.s. Rhag one = anti-uber mob) and put CLERIC and CASTER loot on those fool poosae push-overs.&nbsp; I know you guys all have level 17 characters on test that you levelled all by yourself and what not so you know your game really well but try this sometime guys:&nbsp; /buff up some level 60 characters then spawn Tunare and Rhag 1 and try to beat them both -- get back to me on who is harder.&nbsp; Oh wait, I bet you chumps die to both =P</P><P align=left>You know I constantly bust VI's balls.&nbsp; The truth is, I love their game and think it's sheer brilliance.&nbsp; I just want it to reach its full potential.&nbsp; So for all my criticism of VI, I am their biggest fan.&nbsp; But goddamn, why not consult with some players before implementing some of this stuff?&nbsp; We've all come to accept that Everquest is an eternal work in progress.&nbsp; You have all these people who live and breathe the game -- why not use them as a resource?&nbsp; Oh well, what do I know. . .</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Working As Intended</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_25/fithdisciple.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>l33t spelling. . .</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_25/bannanalope.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_25/jangalope_quote.jpg" border=0></P><a name="newsitem1011859200,36913,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Words All Fail The Magic Prize, Nothing I Can Say When I'm In Your </strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, January 24, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>Major Bug Discovered In ToV</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG></P><P align=left>As a service to the Everquest community I am posting this so that others are aware of the major, glaring bug that seems to have slipped into EQ.&nbsp; Apparently, by entering the zone called Temple of Veeshan your guild roster is likely to DOUBLE in size.&nbsp; Be warned, scheduling a raid in this zone can even seem to activate accounts that have sat dormant for weeks.&nbsp; No need to worry, Verant has a team of programmers working on the problem which at this point is only being referred to by the Latin name:&nbsp; Lootius&nbsp;Whoreius.<HR><P></P><P align=left><STRONG>And now on with the news. . .</STRONG>(yes considering what CNN calls news these days, even a slackdaddy like me can post a bunch of bullshit and get away with calling it *news* I guess)</P><P align=left>We cleared ToV last night.&nbsp;

Manalope ebayed his account.&nbsp; For complete details please check <A href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/16/technology/column_gaming/"><STRONG>this link</STRONG></A>.&nbsp; Of course we were horrified to learn that the Manalope we know and love is no more, that in fact we have been playing EQ with some Daddy Warbucks this whole time.&nbsp; CNN, the news source that of course can never be wrong, also confirmed that Manalope was responsible for the infamous "Cargelia Training Incedent" -- Cargelia, as CNN puts it, is that dragon in Western Wastes that never has SoW and never roams near SG.&nbsp; While CNN was hard at work ensuring their journalistic integrity, they also came across undeniable facts that link Manalope to the Al Queda terrorist network.&nbsp; It seems Manalope (or Osmanalope as his followers call him) came up with an elaborate money laundering program using Everquest and Ebay to fund terrorist operations on a world-wide scale.&nbsp; In a slightly related story CNN also announced that the Beatles in fact had FIVE (not the previously rumored 4) members -- John, Paul, George, Ringo and Manalope.&nbsp; We here at Legacy of Steel would like to thank CNN for proving just how much intergrity&nbsp;exists in the world of journalism these days.&nbsp; Without your hard work, CNN, we actually might have to all start thinking for ourselves someday.</P><P align=left>In other news, our new web site decided that it wanted to be like the old web site and took a nice hefty break from the online world this week.&nbsp; Well, I guess I have alot to update you on although I can't remember what was killed when, I just have some pictures and what not to keep you all happy while you get paid for reading a website at work which would cause your boss to fire your ass in 3 seconds if he knew you were reading it on his dime.</P><P align=left>We decided to kill this dude again, even if the beloved gimp pull to the zone no longer works.&nbsp; Where there's a will, there's a way:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/iv_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><STRONG><EM>A Troll, Two Swarthy Sloots and a dead IV. . . .</EM></STRONG></P><P align=left>Earlier in the week we spent some time killing snakes.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/exiled.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Here's the stats on that sword:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/blasphemousblade.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Currently my the sword resides in my fletching kit along with a Reaver from the Statue of RZ and a Blade of Carnage from the AoW, all eagerly awaiting my next trip to Thurgadin where they will meet their final destination:&nbsp; Tha Hands of Mort.</P><P align=left>We also did the AC Ring last night which in case you did not know is officially called, <STRONG>The Ring of Torture</STRONG>.&nbsp; Other acceptable names include The Ring of Boredom or the Ring of Suck-Ass.&nbsp; Things were going peachy until, in the midst of Boss 6, 1 enchanter died due to the lag, another enchanter went LD and 2 clerics LD'd as well.&nbsp; So we cleared the ring and finished boss 6 with no problems.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/youhaveslain_underking.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>It sucks to have to stop the ring not because we can't handle the spawns, but because we can't handle the lag.&nbsp; Oh well, such is life in Everquest.</P><P align=left>Lastly, this week we also waxed Stanos so that <STRONG>Dorana</STRONG> could get her High Elf mask.&nbsp; You know spawn competition is tough when Stanos is dying. . .</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january_02/1_18/dorana_hie.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>So hopefully the site manages to stay up for more than 24 hours in a row for once.&nbsp; If it does, I'll try to bring you more frequent updates.&nbsp; And please if the site does go down, feel free to NOT log in or post on our messageboards about it.&nbsp; And if you must send someone the obligatory, *Sup-bro-what's-up-with-the-site?* tells, send them to Crazz.&nbsp;
