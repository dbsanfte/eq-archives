<P align=left><HR><STRONG>Lord I Got To Keep On Moving</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Tuesday, April 2, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><html><head>	<title>Untitled</title></head><body><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>And On The Ninth Day God Said, "Let There Be Phat Lewtz"</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_2/aow_dead.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;</FONT><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_2/burrower_dead.jpg" border=0></STRONG></P><P align=left>So in the last update I make that wise-ass crack about guilds raiding with 60-80 people and of course what happens?&nbsp; I schedule the Burrower and AoW and next thing I know we've got 60 people in the raid channel.&nbsp; Granted a few were twinks including my beloved Bitties sitting AFK in Echo Caverns but goddamn, it was NICE having that many people to take on the Burrower and AoW.&nbsp; It was laughable how smooth things went.&nbsp; Feel free to call my a hypocrite, but hot damn, we were a freakin machine tonight.&nbsp; We literally had time to kill between every wave of the burrower circle.&nbsp; For all you chumps that take these big-ass raids to that dong-like nemesis we call the Burrower, I highly recommend you send some of your peeps packing and try it with 40 sometime.&nbsp; 40 people doing the burrower is a damned good time -- pure edge of your seat excitement -- a wipe-out waiting to happen.&nbsp; 60 people? pffffft.&nbsp; Taking candy from a baby.</P><P align=left>AoW was pure magic too.&nbsp; Bzul "Papatank" Target was up for nearly the entire fight.&nbsp; Our clerics simply own.&nbsp; I love talking to people from other guilds because they always bitch about how bad their clerics suck.&nbsp; Yes, modesty be damned, I'll say it right here:&nbsp; LoS has the best goddamned healing in the game.&nbsp; The best part?&nbsp; They refuse to use a cheal rotation =PPPP</P><P align=left>So we killed the Burrower and Mr. Ei Oh Dubya like it was freaking Mooto and Slaythe and then we went off to wax some fool in Seru so we can get a key to&nbsp;a mob that we can kill when the moon aligns with Jupiter and then I decide to log early for once.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that sleep is for the weak.&nbsp; 6 hours is sleeping in for this homey.&nbsp; But for once in my goddamn life I decide that tonight, especially considering what a FINE night it was, I am going to go to bed early so that I can wake up extra early to TCB as the King called it.&nbsp; Takin' Care of Business baby.&nbsp; Well, I log off and am just about to get into bed when I hear a noise from coming from the other room. . .</P><P align=left>This is odd, I think to myself.&nbsp; I walk into my office and what do I see?&nbsp; My goddamned dog is standing ON the fucking desk with his head buried in&nbsp;a bag of Cadbury's Chocolate Eggs.&nbsp; As our Jesus-worshipping readers know, Sunday was Easter.&nbsp; My mom had given me those chocolate eggs and absent mindedly I left the bag on my desk.&nbsp; Leave it to my 18 pound little cacksugging bastard of a dog to find a way to jump onto the goddamned desk and eat the entire bag of chocolate eggs.&nbsp; Somewhere, in a galaxy far far away, I had once heard that chocolate is apparently bad for dogs.&nbsp; My first thought was to shove my finger down the little mo faka's throat and make him yuke it up.&nbsp; But then I considered the mess that would make and also the general violent nature of such an act.&nbsp; He might only weigh 18 pounds but Jack Russells have jaws like a fucking Mako shark.&nbsp; I wasn't about to lose a digit trying to get little Jack to "yell Europe".</P><P align=left>My second thought was, "Well, fuck the little bastard -- he made his bed, let him lie in it."&nbsp; And I was just going to go to bed.&nbsp; I mean he looked fine.&nbsp; Sure an 18 pound dog on a few pounds of chocolate is as strung out and hyper as Pookie from New Jack City in a Cocoa field, but hey, he gets what he deserves.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; But then I started feeling a tinge of guilt.&nbsp; Or something.&nbsp; I mean what if chocolate is really bad for the dude and sometime in the middle of the night he croaks.&nbsp; Mondays and Thursdays are trash nights after all so I wouldn't be able to chuck the corpse for 3 more days.&nbsp; Or what if he shit or puked all over the place?</P><P align=left>So being the animal rights activist I am, I call this emergency animal hotline.&nbsp; This girl answers the phone and I tell her my dog just ate a shit-ton of chocolate.&nbsp; At this point I am just praying she says, "Chill baby lover, he'll be a-ok."&nbsp; Instead she starts asking all the details then tells me I better bring him in.&nbsp; Well, fucking great.&nbsp; So I gotta schlep my little cacksugging dog halfway to Sierra Madre in the middle of the night.&nbsp; On the upside I am thinking, "Hey, that girl sounded kinda cute. . .this might not be so bad. . ."&nbsp; But I get there and instead of some cute vet assistant I gotta deal with some tired old guy who makes me hold my cacksugging animal while he shoves a thermometer up his ass long enough to take his temperature.&nbsp; And what difference does that even make?&nbsp; He ate goddamn chocolate.&nbsp; Make him puke and get it over with.</P><P align=left>Once the assistant is done with the dog, he calls in the Vet who I swear to god was that Nazi war criminal doctor.&nbsp; So Doctor Mengela tells me he's got to give Jack (my little motherfucker) some medicine or IV or god knows what to *purge his system* and then once that's done he's got to give him something to make the *purging of the system* come to an end.&nbsp; Segue to two hours later. . .the dog is fine.&nbsp; Two hours and two-hundred dollars later and my chocolate eating bitch of an animal gets to live.</P><P align=left>I swear to god, the next time Jack decides to eat chocolate the problem is going to cost me the price of one Hefty bag to fix.&nbsp; Somewhere out there my ex-girlfriend, the thankless bitch who begged me for that dog in the first place, is out there laughing.&nbsp; And goddamn she was useless.&nbsp; Who cares if she could suck a golfball through a garden hose?&nbsp; The aggravation that the little bastard dog she left me with sure wasn't worth that minor, fleeting gratification.&nbsp; Jack better think twice about eating chocolate again.&nbsp; On the upside, the Emergency Animal Clinic is across the street from the In-N-Out, so at least I got a good burger out of the whole fiasco.</P><P align=left>Oops, I think I got off subject.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/september/jack.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_2/prophylactik_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_2/rhapscomingout_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_2/saatann_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_2/uncletom_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_2/webpageupdates_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_2/crazz_quote.gif" border=0></P></body></html>
