Well, let me save everyone some trouble.&nbsp; I could care less about GM events.&nbsp; If a GM wants me to kill him so bad he can come track me down and challenge me to a duel.&nbsp; Those events are lag-ridden jackassfests.&nbsp;

Farming Vulak was as boring as can be but at least if you're gonna farm something, let it be a fun fight.&nbsp; My favorite part of the AoW fight is when he enrages.&nbsp; All you warriors on other servers try this (note: if&nbsp;LoS warriors do this you'll get a swift kick to the nuts) stop attacking and turn the AoW on enrage!!&nbsp; With any luck you'll kill all of your monks, rangers&nbsp;and rogues within 2 seconds.&nbsp; It's quite funny although it ruins any hope of a flawless victory.&nbsp; And no, LoS hasn't had a flawless AoW kill yet.&nbsp; Our best kill to date&nbsp;cost us&nbsp;2 deaths.</P><P align=left>Patch day was pretty fun for us.&nbsp; We basically killed everything that was spawned and then went looking for more.&nbsp; We've been camping the hell out of our coveted bane weapons and have had pure-shit luck.&nbsp; Man, it reminds me of all the time and effort it took for us to get our HP/Creator and AL keys.&nbsp; I'd say we killed 30-40 commanders before getting those keys.&nbsp; But of course some random jackass can get the key on the first try.&nbsp; I guess it's the same way with all of SoL:&nbsp; Get lucky on key camps, get lucky on *stumbling upon recipes*, get lucky on rare components, get lucky on combines.&nbsp; It's absolutely no fun.&nbsp; And now we're at the point where people are farming Seru, so you can forget about any hope of a change to the process required for weapons.&nbsp; They'll cry foul if the weapon quest is adjusted or retuned (and I guess rightfully so).&nbsp; It's a big mess.&nbsp; I really can't believe the key and weapon bullshit we as players&nbsp;are putting up with in SoL.&nbsp; Yet like lemmings to the cliff we persist. . .</P><P align=left>So rather than sit in a boring, long, poor experience camp with the hope of getting one single rare quest component which would go for one single combine which might fail, we decided to head to VP so we could actually kill something somewhat fun and do what we like to do as a guild -- RAID NOT CAMP.&nbsp; So here is this week's money shot:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_20/vp_4_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>I guess the next goal is to get 5 or 6 dragons in that picture.&nbsp; Yeah, almost all of the loot rots when we do VP (and no you can't have any so don't ask).&nbsp; But the game is beyond loot now.&nbsp; And let's face it, loot is so incredibly fucked up in Luclin you can't play for loot anymore.&nbsp; That Seru BP that Afterlife got is the best exanple that there is no hope for loot anymore.&nbsp; I am beginning to think that loot is just made and placed in the game by some random number generator.&nbsp; And does it really matter?&nbsp; Anyone&nbsp;melee that plays at the high level of the game only cares about one stat.&nbsp; It's funny and sad that you can play the game for 3 years, earn 60 levels, earn countless AA points and yet only one of the little numbers under the statistics tab has any relevance to the actual game.&nbsp; We're supposed to get excited because a BP has&nbsp;75 AC??&nbsp;Wonder if&nbsp;it would be so incredibly taxing for the dude who capped AC to walk over to the dude who makes loot and say, "Hey jackass, I capped AC -- try again on that Seru loot because right now 75 AC means jack and shit, chippy."&nbsp; Oh well, I could sit and bitch more but I think I'll go spend 8 hours camping a rare component so I can discover new encounters to beta best. . .err I mean bitch about. . .oops I meant have fun enjoying!!!

Specifically, I will be designing quests for <A href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/">World of Warcraft</A>, Blizzard's MMORPG based on the popular <A href="http://www.blizzard.com/worlds-warcraft.shtml">Warcraft </A>series.&nbsp; In addition to my duties as Quest Designer, I will also be expected to contribute to helping design the end game content for <A href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/">World of Warcraft</A>.&nbsp; The reason I am sharing this information (besides the fact that I have a masochistic love of reading rants and flames about myself) is because I know that the fans of this site are hardcore MMORPG players.&nbsp; The readers of this site have also come to know my personal opinions on what constitutes a fun gaming experience versus what feels like a complete waste of time or poorly designed encounter.</P><P align=left>You've all read my opinions on such things as tedious key camps, obvious time sinks devoid of any story or linear narrative, quests which reward the lucky over the skilled and quest rewards which are out of synch with the amount of time and effort required to complete them.&nbsp; I hope that my association with <A href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/">World of Warcraft</A> will serve to comfort MMORPG fans that "one of us" is on the other side of the fence, looking out for the interests of the player.</P><P align=left>The collective vision behind <A href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/">World of Warcraft</A> is what really won me over.&nbsp; The folks working on the game are focused on making the world of Azeroth fun for all kinds of players, ranging from the casual gamer to hardcore people like you and me.&nbsp; To put it bluntly, they don't want you reading a book or watching TV while playing their game at the same time.&nbsp; The game is captivating enough where other distractions aren't necessary.</P><P align=left>Blizzard's desire to provide well designed high-end content will prove to be a breath of fresh air for the readers of this site.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I cannot go into much detail at this time but I can say that there are ideas being discussed for the hardcore, end-game player which are nothing short of groundbreaking.&nbsp; You guys, the fans of this site, know how discerning I am when it comes to "uber" content in a game.&nbsp; Trust me, you have much to look forward to.</P><P align=left>And to top it all off, the game simply looks amazing.&nbsp; I was blown away by what I saw.&nbsp; MMORPG fans have some very exciting things dawning on the horizon.</P><P align=left>So with all that is going on with me, you'll have to excuse any lapses in updates to the site here.&nbsp; I will try my hardest to give you slackers something to read while you should be working.&nbsp; But in the meantime, there's a whole world of NPC's that need to learn the words "cacksugger" and "mo faka" and the like. . .although something tells me I'm already in trouble with the boss.</P><P align=left>--Tig</P><P align=left>&nbsp;</P><P align=center><A href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif" border=0></A></P></body></html>
