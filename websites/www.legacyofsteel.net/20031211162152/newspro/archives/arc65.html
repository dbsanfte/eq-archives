We moved             through the Halls of Testicles with ease.&nbsp; We did not attempt             Dozekar, so I guess saying the Halls were cleared is a bit of bad             information.&nbsp; Drops were so-so.&nbsp; Of course all the named             drakes dropped quest shit that will only become relavent once             Dozekar the Cacksugger dies.&nbsp; Other drops included some plate             helms, gloves, chain gloves, silk gloves, leather boots, leather             gloves.&nbsp; Really not a lot of armor drops considering the number             of mobs that were killed, but o-fuggin-well.&nbsp; They're gonna be             raiding ToV again tomorrow night so perhaps they'll have better luck             with Legs and BP's.&nbsp; Unfortunately, yours truly won't be there.             . .but I should be back Saturday or Sunday with an Update.</P>            <P align=left>So anyway, we kill the first two Wurms in the Testicle             Halls, and we're killing the next mobs down below when my doorbell             rings.&nbsp; I'm thinking to myself, "I didn't order no chinese             food. . .don't answer that. . .nothing but trouble."&nbsp; Sure             enough, it's my next door neighbor standing there.&nbsp; "I need to             ask you a big favor," she pleads.&nbsp; "My rabbit. . .well, see my             husband is out of town and. . .there's blood. . .I need someone to             come look."&nbsp; At this point I'm thinking to myself, what the             fuck is this chick talking about.&nbsp; So I go over to her             apartment and sure enough there's this fucking rabbit hopping             around.&nbsp; "I need you to look at her or hold her while I check             her.&nbsp; I need to see if she's bleeding," she tells me.&nbsp; I             look at Bunny Fucking Foo Foo on the ground and tell her, "She looks             pretty much ok to me. . ." and head for the door.&nbsp; My neighbor             responds, " No Wait!&nbsp; That's not her.&nbsp; That's Floppy. .             .that's the male.&nbsp; Emma is outisde."&nbsp; So she drags me on             to the terrace and there is this black little ball of fur in a crate             and all over the floor is some ORANGE *stuff*.&nbsp; So she makes me             pick up this fucking bunny as she checks it for blood.&nbsp; The             whole time I am thinking, what a useless fucking pet. . .fucking             rabbits.&nbsp; I felt like saying, "Listen sweetheart, here's twenty             bucks. . .throw that fucking&nbsp;furry mess into the trash and go             buy yourself a new one."&nbsp; Well, it comes to down to this.&nbsp;             Apparently the orange *stuff* was not blood.&nbsp; Which is good and             bad news.&nbsp; Because the options you're left with when you got an             orange-stained bunny and it ain't bleeding aren't exactly             rosey.&nbsp; So I'm trying to get the hell out of there.&nbsp; I             mean, I was on a 20 minute AFK at that point. . .I wasn't dealing             with a life or death emergency, but some stupid fucking bunny.&nbsp;             Next thing I know, she hands me the phone.&nbsp; I'm talking to some             Vet.&nbsp; My neighbor wants me to give the exact description of the             scene in case she missed something.&nbsp; The whole scene was just             too weird. . .What does this have to do with EQ?&nbsp; Well             nothing.&nbsp; But next time you're pissed off at that guy in your             group for going AFK for 20 minutes, stop and think, "Maybe his             neighbor's bunny is bleeding to death. . ." or better yet, don't.</P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/badnamingfilter.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/sirran_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/tiggie.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/tigolesmommy.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Quote of the             Day</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/darvulia_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Turned on by my l33t use of Neb's Warbone, Darvulia             could not resist sending me *hot* cyber         tells.</P></font><a name="newsitem984643200,72484,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Well, well. . .Look What The Cat Dragged In</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, March 15, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>   <P align=left>I figured if John Travolta's career could do it, so             could I.&nbsp; That's right -- come back.&nbsp; The truth is, I             heard melee can now bind in Field of Bone and I almost blinded             myself by the massive erection shooting through my trousers at the             very thought.&nbsp; How could I resist not coming back?&nbsp; Well,             all sarcasm aside, I am playing Everquest again.&nbsp; I appreciated             all the kind things people said when I left.&nbsp; I also enjoyed             the speculation over why I left (nerfs etc.).&nbsp; Truth is, I was             massively burned out.&nbsp; As much as I love this game, leading a             guild is a ton of work.&nbsp; Luckily we have a new leader now,             Oogtuug. Oogtuug is the famous Draed Vahn, the original GM of LoS,             our founder.&nbsp; The best part about Oogtuug taking over is now I             can bitch and moan everytime I don't get loot.&nbsp; I also plan on             bitching and moaning any time he schedules an event that takes place             in a zone where I don't need loot.&nbsp; I think I'll bitch and moan             if I have to wait around too long for something too.&nbsp; If we             lose to some mob, it will of course be Oogtuug's fault.&nbsp;             Mostly, now that I am not GM, I have to dedicate most of my time to             figuring out how to best bitch and moan to Oogtuug.</P>            <P align=left>So I gotta say, leaving Everquest was entirely             overrated.&nbsp; It was nice.&nbsp; I *was* spending a bit too much             time playing.&nbsp; But I quickly realized how insanely boring my             life was.&nbsp; You know, when you're done with your daily             responsibilities. . .it's late at night, no one to go out with etc.             . .that's the best time for EQ.&nbsp; What did I do instead?&nbsp;             Well shit.&nbsp; First there was TV.&nbsp; I swear to god I don't             know how people watch television.&nbsp; I read EQ message boards and             I hear people flame hardcore gamers for having high /played             times.&nbsp; Wonder what people's /watched would look like if TV had             that feature.&nbsp; Jesus, television isn't suited for retarded             chimps.&nbsp; It's so bad.&nbsp; "Oh my god, Survivor was so good             this week, some dumb numbnuts breathed in smoke and passed out in             the fire!"&nbsp; Puh-lease.</P>            <P align=left>After giving up on TV, I tried to fill that nighttime             void with another computer game.&nbsp; The one I always liked most,             before EQ at least, was Counterstrike.&nbsp; Counterstrike is a             great game but I must say, EQ spoiled me a bit.&nbsp; Granted, our             guildchat is not exactly what I'd call intelectually elite. . .it             does at least go beyond the limits of what Counterstrike can             provide, which apparently is, "Fag.

Fuck You."&nbsp;             Those four phrases are all you need for a lifetime of happy             fragging.</P>            <P align=left>I missed my friends.&nbsp; I really don't care what             we're doing, I just missed the group of people I got to know             online.&nbsp; You can criticize computer games for being anti-social             all you want, but it beats sitting around watching 10 dirty, greedy,             retards eat a chicken in the Australian Outback.</P>            <P align=left>Enough of my rambling.&nbsp; I am supposed to be             sharing with you all Uber l33t l3wtz and stuff, right?&nbsp; Well,             sheeit.&nbsp; Problem is our roster has&nbsp;been hurting             lately.&nbsp; We lost a lot of good friends the past few             weeks.&nbsp; So we've been taking it&nbsp;easy.&nbsp; About 14 of us             went to check out the new portion of Hate tonight.&nbsp; Hate was             always one of my favorite&nbsp;zones.&nbsp; Apparently, a             breastplate drops off of nearly everyone of those lower mobs these             days. . .hehe.&nbsp; We spend our time up top though.&nbsp; Killing             the new stuff.&nbsp; Drops were fairly scarce up there but there             were some neat sites.</P>            <P align=center>&nbsp; <IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/hate_01.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><EM>This was a neat little room I found. . .must. .             .kill. . .gnome</EM></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/hate_02.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><EM>Inky Cult -- Drink the Kool Aid, Drink the Kool             Aid</EM></P>            <P align=left>And now for some ph4t H4t3 l3wtz:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/rainmentofthechosen.jpg"             border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/vambracesoftheuntamed.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Robe is nice, yes?</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/greavesofharmony.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/nizz_greaves.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>After donning these geaves, Nizzarr had the sudden             urge to redecorate the house and watch Judy Garland movies.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/hatecrystal.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>A-very-a-nice-a</P>            <P align=left>Like I said, we don't really have the numbers to kill             much right now.&nbsp; Luckily, lots of people took a break and are             now returning, refreshed and ready for uber-leetness once             again.&nbsp; I wish I had dead Inny pictures or new Inny loot to             post for ya, but well, I don't. . .and I wont. . .at least for a few             days :p&nbsp; BTW, should be interesting in the new Planes             now.&nbsp; Inny and CT are no more Poosae-Freebie-Mo Faka's. .             .Luckily, for the pick-up raid crews, the old god loot drops all             over the place, is cake to get and the other armor drops are more             frequent than ever.&nbsp; You foolmans have it easy.&nbsp; We camped             Hate and Fear for ages, stuck at level 50, for armor that hardly             ever dropped.&nbsp; We also walked to school uphill in the             snow.&nbsp; Both ways.</P>            <P align=left>So&nbsp;what do you do when you feel the need for an             Epic Battle yet your roster is anything but epic?&nbsp; Take 4 of             your good friends and go on a Priest of Discord hunting spree.&nbsp;             Worked for&nbsp;us the other night:</P>            <P align=center>&nbsp; <IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/leick_pod.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Leick sports his PoD stick</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/podgroup.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Winkin and Adorean in the latest PoD-wear</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_15/tigpod.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>So many PoD's, so little time. . .</P>            <P align=left>Best thing is, that mo faka PoD spawns again in like 6             minutes. . .</P>            <P align=left>What?
