Posting pictures             of dead Dozekars gets old after awhile.&nbsp; Well, I got a lot of             responses to my rant about factions.&nbsp; First off, thanks to the             many who supported me on various forums.&nbsp; To those who said             things like, "Why don't you just switch" I'd like to offer this             class in Reading Comprehension:</P>            <P align=left>I quote myself:&nbsp; <STRONG><EM>All of what I have             to say is null and void if you disregard the notion of             balance.</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left>I love those suggestions, "Just switch."&nbsp; No             fucking shit, sherlock.&nbsp; Like we're not on the verge of doing             just that.&nbsp; What I was attempting to do was have those "in             power" re-evaluate the factions in this game so that perhaps the             game OVERALL would be better for EVERYONE.&nbsp; Tough concept for             some.</P>            <P align=left>Ok, not in the mood to rant tonight.&nbsp; Had a nice             relaxing 4th of July on the beach.&nbsp; Although someone please             explain why the water in California is friggin 40 degrees, not to             mention that disturbing brown hue.&nbsp; I guess none of this             matters here on an Everquest webpage.&nbsp; We only care about ph4t             l3wtz right?&nbsp; Ok here's some ph4t l3wtz for you all to             peruse:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/silvermaskoftheslayer.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Request of the Strong Completed!</P>            <P align=left>Yes, finally the "broken quest" is unbroken.&nbsp;             Thanks to Vald for giving us the head's up that the quest had             finally been fixed.&nbsp; Mask is pretty nice.&nbsp; Not so nice             when you think about the fact that it requires 4 tears and Doze only             drops 2-3 tears now.&nbsp; Nothing like taking 30+ people two weeks             minimum to get one person a mask.</P>            <P align=left>Anyway, I'm proud to say LoS was the first to complete             the majority of Dozekar quests.&nbsp; For a short while we were             actually proud that we stuck to our faction path.&nbsp; Someone had             to discover this shit right?&nbsp; Well, there are only a few more             challenges left for us within our reach on this faction.&nbsp;             Unless something changes drastically soon, it's not hard to figure             out what we'll be gunning for next.&nbsp; Farming l3wtz just doesn't             get my nipples hard.</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Gage, The Uber             Banker</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/gage_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Welcome to the Drunken World of             Rhap</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/rhap_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/rhap_quote2.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/frigole.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/stigolestalker.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/tigolesbalszack.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/twgole.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the             Day</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july/7_5/parv_quote.jpg"             border=0></P></font><a name="newsitem993884400,61358,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Dreadlock Rasta</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Saturday, June 30, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>  <P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>What's Wrong With This             Picture?</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/dozedead_6_29.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG><EM>I shouldn't be able to tower over             anyone, especially a motherfucking dragon. . .</EM></STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Today you'll have to indulge me in a little             rant.&nbsp; I'm sitting here waiting for my ride to show up -- gonna             be gone until Sunday night.&nbsp; But this game just has me thinking             right now. . .more like boggling.&nbsp; Now, we all knew the             upgraded North Wing loots were coming.&nbsp; They *needed* to be             upgraded.&nbsp; Crap was dropping for the effort required to kill             that stuff.&nbsp; But the reason they upgraded was for balance             right?&nbsp; All of what I have to say is null and void if you             disregard the notion of balance.&nbsp; Please work with me here,             Pro-Giant people, I put up with your months of whining -- I even             backed you up.&nbsp; Now look at things from a Pro-CoV             perspective.</P>            <P align=left>We're stuck with one goddamned "boss mob" in ToV.             Dozekar the Gimped.&nbsp; Perhaps if we still had the "old Doze" to             contend with I wouldn't be so anxious to post this rant.&nbsp; By             Old Doze, some of you actually know what I am talking about.&nbsp;             For those of you who have no clue what I am saying, please go back             to Karnors and continue to bask in your clueslessness.&nbsp;             Basically, Dozekar is or will be the Venril Sathir of late Kunark --             a.k.a Clusterfuck Mob of the Expansion.&nbsp; The symbols from the             named drakes are an equal dick in the ass.&nbsp; Let's not even look             at this from a loot perspective for a minute.&nbsp; From an             excitement-thrill-of-the-kill perpective we get the shaft.&nbsp;             Pro-Giant people have Telk, Goz, Lenidara, Lord Vyemm, Vulak, etc             etc etc etc to&nbsp;kill.&nbsp; More boss mobs then there is time in             the day.&nbsp; Now, don't be a cacksugger and say to me, "Well, you             have Statue, Vind, Tormax."&nbsp; How bout fucking Yelinak and all             of Skyshrine?&nbsp; How bout a 3 month head start on Sleepers?</P>            <P align=left>Anyway, Pro-Dragon people want THINGS TO KEEEL.&nbsp;             I don't care about the goddamned loot.&nbsp; The ToV quest loot is             going to be so rare, it doesn't matter anyway.&nbsp; We're lucky to             complete 3 quests out of 4 Dozekar kills right now (4 doze spawns =             1 month).&nbsp; What happens a few months from now when other guilds             are Doze-capable?&nbsp; It's a fucking joke -- and even Pro-Giant             people know it is.</P>            <P align=left>Here are the solutions I feel would best address this             gross imbalance:</P>            <P align=left>A)&nbsp; Dozekar drops LOOT in addition to             tears.&nbsp; And please, give us old Doze back.&nbsp; Likewise, the             named drakes drop 4-8 symbols each time.&nbsp; These should spawn             every 3 days AT LEAST, including Doze.</P>            <P align=left>B)&nbsp; Add some loot to the named drakes -- buff             them up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make them hard mo fakas. . .make them so hard             it makes farming armor virtually impossible with them up.&nbsp; Give             them random drops like those that exist in North ToV.</P>            <P align=left>C)&nbsp; Remove the faction from North ToV.&nbsp; Give             Telk, Lendinara and Gozz in the West Wing Dozekar-equivalent loot             (so the Pro-Giant people don't bust a nut whining).&nbsp; Pro-Giant             gets 3 dragons, Pro-CoV gets 1, everyone has a shot at the North             Wing mobs.&nbsp; This is the best option in my opinion.</P>            <P align=left>D) If you're going to be a bunch of cacksuggers and             not let us hunt in North ToV, put Doze and the HoT mobs on             +Guardians of Veeshan and +Claws of Veeshan faction.&nbsp; This is             the worst option but at least you'd be throwing us the small bone of             being able to get a shot at PoM.&nbsp; Sure there's nothing more             than a minor fascination with PoM, but we can pass our time there             while waiting 7 days for Dozekar to spawn and drop his 2 tears.</P>            <P align=left>E) You're not going to give us anything more to kill             in ToV? Fine. . .give us Undead Kael or some shit.&nbsp; Or add 10             BOSS level mobs to Kael with HUGE faction hits so Pro-Giant people             stay the fuck away.&nbsp; Make sure to load them with 12/16 daggers             and 14/18 whips. . .ac 90 breastplates while you're at it.&nbsp;             Sounds fair now, right?</P>            <P align=left>Make me God of Everquest and I choose OPTION C             (although E sounds pretty fun too).</P>            <P align=left>Right now, VI has created two choices:&nbsp; 1) Go             Pro-Giant, get fat loots, face many challenges. or 2) Go Pro-Dragon,             farm fat loots. . .zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</P>            <P align=left>Ok I am done ranting.&nbsp; I don't want you Pro-Giant             bitches coming and whining to me on our messageboards.&nbsp; I never             called for any nerf.&nbsp; What I am asking for is for CoV to be             MORE DIFFICULT as a matter of fact.&nbsp; There is more to balance             then just placing *nice items* in different locations.</P>            <P align=left>There's my rant.&nbsp; Of course, this is MY opinion             not necessarily that of anyone in my guild.&nbsp; And like I said,             before accusing me of merely whining, look at things from my             perspective first.</P>            <P align=left>Tigole Bitches</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/arlosea.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/dupbudo.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/parva.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/tenajsmouth.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/tigolesguzzler.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june/6_30/tigolespooper.jpg"             border=0></P></font>
