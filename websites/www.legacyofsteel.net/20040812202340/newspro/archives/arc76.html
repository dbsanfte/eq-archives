Everythng was going             smoothly.&nbsp; We even ran into our old friend,             <STRONG>Vaniki</STRONG>.&nbsp; Here's us giving him a big             LoS-Hello:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/Vaniki_fight.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>And here's the proud new owner of Vaniki's             Willsapper:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/leick_willsapper.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Congrats to <STRONG>Cowboy</STRONG>!</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/willsapper.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>So getting the Willsapper for Leick was good             news.&nbsp; But then I went to check on Zlandicar.&nbsp; I was             hoping to need to be CoH'd outta there with a big dragon on my ass,             or else end up dead leaving a pain in the ass CR for one of my             guildmates. . .then we could regroup and do some             dragon-ass-kicking.&nbsp; Instead I found myself in a very             empty&nbsp;Zlandicar's Lair.&nbsp; One thing I did find interesting,             I set off nine traps scouting the place. . .not a single one did             damage or break invis.&nbsp; And yes, I was using Sense Traps but             the damned refresh time is too long for me to stand around waiting             for it to pop each time.&nbsp; Oh well, I guess I should STFU and             not complain.&nbsp; Knowing Verant they will patch in             impossible-to-sense, deathtouching traps if they read this.</P>            <P align=left>As you can guess, we were pretty bummed that there was             no fuggin dragon to beat down.&nbsp; But, you might also say, well             why didn't that dumbass halfling go check earlier?&nbsp; Actually,             don't say that please.&nbsp; Or else blame it on Desp.&nbsp; Desp             said Zlandicar was up.&nbsp; WTF Desp. . .wasting all our time             there.&nbsp; Fuggin Desp.</P>            <P align=left>Disappointed yet still eager to keeel, we headed over             to Dorf Town to lay our blades to that cacksugger, <STRONG>The             Dain</STRONG>.&nbsp; For those of you who follow our exploits,             you'll remember that&nbsp;we have never gotten to fight His             Shittyiness the Dain.&nbsp; Each time he has poofed on us.&nbsp;             Well, I hate to say it but when the&nbsp;Dain declared this last             night, he wasn't joking:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/dain_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Yup, he was right</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/dain_missing_small.jpg"             border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/dain_missing_small.jpg"             border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/dain_missing_small.jpg"             border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/dain_missing_small.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>4 Dain Attempts, 4 Poofs</P>            <P align=left>Now for all you critics sitting at home I'd like to             point out the following.&nbsp; Each time we have pulled the Dain, we             have used a different method.&nbsp; We have attempted him in             multiple spots.&nbsp; It's not like we enjoy getting everyone to             Dorf Town, killing a bunch of             high-hit-point-crap-loot-dropping-dorfs only to Poof the Dain             because of our Dain-pulling-gimpyness.&nbsp; I'd like to think we             have a very decent record of not doing dumbass-gimp things. . .just             look at the mobs we have killed time and time again.&nbsp; I             seriously hope VI takes a look into this problem or else issues some             kind of statement that the Dain is poofing as intended. . .in which             case. . .why the fug would you make a mob that poofs for 7             days?&nbsp; Please Verant -- log in and send me a tell.&nbsp; It's             obvious your Quality Assurance guys are far too busy making sure the             fire beetle pathing in West Commons is working right to spend any             time on one of the main mobs of your new expansion.&nbsp; LoS will             gladly give you some QA time if you'd like to witness your             programming at it's worst.</P>            <P align=left>Well, aren't I just a big cacksugger?&nbsp; Don't             answer that please.</P>            <P align=left>So no update for tomorrow because&nbsp;I won't be             playing EQ at all today. . .this gives you more time to stare at             Cowboy and wish you were half as cool as he is.</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards:</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/luvumstigole.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/tigoleslave.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Quote of the             Day:</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/january/1_20/valia_quote.jpg"             border=0>&nbsp;</P>            <P   align=center></font><a name="newsitem979804800,32513,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>I Wish I Was Like You -- Easily Amused</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, January 18, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>  <P align=left>Another patch, another             <STRONG>Trakanon</STRONG>.&nbsp;

            I need to go get something to eat anyway.&nbsp; I'm freakin starved             after yesterday.&nbsp; Around noon I decide to grab a quick bite to             eat.&nbsp; I drive to Carl's Jr.&nbsp;

So I'm thinking what did those cacksuggers at Carls             do?&nbsp; Bite my hamburger then wrap it up?&nbsp; Or worse, did             someone get the wrong order, take a bite and send it back?&nbsp;
