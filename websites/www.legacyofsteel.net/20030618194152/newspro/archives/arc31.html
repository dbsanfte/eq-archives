That's just how bored we were.&nbsp; The other night, with everything dead on the server, we went looking for any mob we could find.&nbsp; It so happened that Lady Vox was chilling in her Lair.&nbsp; So we quickly scrambled to see how many sub-52 twinks we had.&nbsp; At first we assembled about 15 and took a run at Vox.&nbsp; The first attempt, with so few people, was pure comedy.&nbsp; We had no enchanter to sieve her on the first attempt.&nbsp; People charged early.&nbsp; We had two clerics there.&nbsp; After 3 cheals this is what the scene looked like:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_30/vox_fail.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Never ones to quit, we rebuffed and brought in another cleric twink and then it was pure ownage time.&nbsp; You can laugh all you want but everyone there will tell you this was some of the funnest stuff we've done in EQ in a LONG ASS time.&nbsp; Here's the glory shot of the heroes!!</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_30/twinks.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center>Highest level twink - 52.&nbsp; Lowest level - 23.</P><P align=left>We also paid a visit to Ol' Yelinak this week too.&nbsp; I usually dread doing this dragon because I think it's one of the few mobs in EQ (short of Tunare or AoW) where numbers can be a deciding factor.&nbsp; This Yelinak raid went smooth however and I think everyone there had a fun time.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_30/yelinak_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>We've been working hard trying to get everyone their Ring 10's as well.&nbsp; This week's lucky winner was <STRONG>Abru</STRONG>.&nbsp; Our war this week started out like shit.&nbsp; I swear to god everyone was just running around Great Divide like chickens with their heads cut off.&nbsp; Of course, being an asshole, I made sure to make my displeasure known.&nbsp; Luckily by Wave 2 everyone got their shit together and by Wave 3 we were looking better than ever before.&nbsp; In fact, I'd be willing to say that it was the best Wave 3 we have done yet.&nbsp; As always, thanks to the people in the zone who decided to stick around and join in the fun.&nbsp; Your help DOES make a difference and we appreciate the contribution.&nbsp; Many congrats to Abru on her Ring!</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_30/narandi_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>We also invited a new <STRONG>Rogue</STRONG> this week, <STRONG>Crazz</STRONG>:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_30/crazz_rogue.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_30/crazz.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Look forward to seeing everyone on Rallos this weekend for the Test of Tactics.&nbsp;

Someone misses a snare on a drake and it runs, agroing 9 mobs that all come back to the group.&nbsp; Boom.&nbsp; Instant wipe out.</P><P align=left><STRONG>Starting Off on the Wrong Suck</STRONG></P><P align=left>So we recover and move to the Aaryonar pull spot.&nbsp; The Aaryonar pull consists of the dragon training right on to the casters, hitting them all with the AE.&nbsp; Along with Aaryonar comes a Flurry Drake.&nbsp; We somehow managed to get Aaryonar to half with the Flurry Drake and no mana but it was a losing cause so we experienced our first ever Aaryonar loss.</P><P align=left><STRONG>To Suck or Not to Suck -- it wasn't even in question. . .</STRONG></P><P align=left>Time for the Feshlak pull!&nbsp; Feshlak comes with both of his pets.&nbsp; We then proceed to push Feshlak up and over the stairs (impossible to get to unless Feshlak summons you).&nbsp; Feshlak summons our main tank up onto the stairs, OOR from healing, yet close enough to agro the TWO blue chealing drakes at the bottom of the stairs.&nbsp; Yes, that's right -- for the price of ONE Feshlak pull you too can get TWO pets, TWO chealing drakes and an AE'ing dragon!&nbsp; All you have to do is suck nuts!</P><P align=left>Amazingly, in a fleeting moment of unsuck, we somehow won that fight.</P><P align=left><STRONG>The Sucking Continues</STRONG></P><P align=left>Kriezen gets pulled with a Glimmer Drake, and two pets.&nbsp; The main tank dies instantly.&nbsp; The tank mez died instantly.&nbsp; That's right folks, it doesn't get any more uber than a Kriezen wipe-out.&nbsp; You know you have mastered the Art of Suck when you end up dead to Kriezen.</P><P align=left>So there ended the night of suck.&nbsp; What was truly funny about it all was that we had some crazy number like 50 with us.&nbsp; People started getting pissed and logging off.&nbsp; So I was actually nervous about Vyemm for the first time since our first Vyemm kills.&nbsp; I'm thinking, goddamn we just Fubar'd Kriez, how the fuck are we supposed to kill Vyemm.&nbsp; But alas our Vyemm and Vulak kills were textbook and everyone was back to looking like the guild I know and love.&nbsp; For all you guilds out there who are just SO bored of the normal routine of farming uber mobs, I highly recommend you try out a night of suck for some added entertainment!!</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/avatrowar.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/bearrdo.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/bobdawondergoat.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/emperoroshissar.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/fsoccor.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/garycolemon.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/makisupa.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/phoneofbat.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/tigolebasher.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/tigoleplezureme.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/tigolespoorgoat.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/wannablowme.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/whatwhat.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_28/wangho_quote.jpg" border=0></P><a name="newsitem1006588800,26849,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Don't Quote Me Boy Cause I Ain't Said Shit</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Saturday, November 24, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>Two Vulaks, Two Ring 10's and a ToT Title</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG>Not such a bad week for the Evil Empire</STRONG></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/vulak_1.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/vulak_2.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>With all the patching and crashing this week we were able to get a lot of killing in before Turkey Day.&nbsp; Vulak, as always, was kind to us.&nbsp; He finally dropped another robe which went to Cazan.&nbsp; Many congrats to him and to everyone else who got loot this week.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/cazan_robe.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>We just finished our second Ring War of the week as well.&nbsp; Goddamn this last one was truly classic.&nbsp; I knew today would be slow, the day after Thanksgiving and all, many people travelling etc.&nbsp; We decide to get the Ring War going.&nbsp; Right before Monq hands his stuff in I do /who all Legacy to discover we have 25 people in the zone (2 of which were just 2-boxed port twinks).&nbsp; Luckily there were some folks in the zone who decided they wanted to help out.&nbsp; Well, everything gets going and we cruise through waves one and two with ease.&nbsp; Then wave 3 starts and we just get slammed.&nbsp; We had no where near the amount of clerics or healing power in general needed to win the war.&nbsp; But everyone made the best of it and the healers who were there did an amazing job.&nbsp; So I spot the final unit of Wave Three charging for Thurg and I try to divert some but get instantly killed.&nbsp; I quickly rezoned to Great Divide (my bind point was in Thurg) only to see a handful of people fighting the entire wave at once, ALL at the Thurgadin entrance.&nbsp; At that point I thought we had already lost.&nbsp; Dragging my corpse to a safe place to loot it, I kept watching giant after giant swarm to Thurg.&nbsp; Yet somehow there was always a warrior on one of the giants, or a ranger or a druid. . .anyone.&nbsp; At that point we here Narandi yell that he had underestimated our forces and was gonna get the fuck out of dodge (his standard, "You have beaten the giants" line).&nbsp; Monq hauls ass to agro Narandi before he flees.&nbsp; However the Harm Touch kills him and Narandi starts off toward EW.&nbsp; After looting my jboots I run to the canyon which leads to EW and find Narandi there.&nbsp; After some minor encouragement Narandi decides to follow me.&nbsp; At this point there are 0 clerics alive in GD and a mound of corpses at Thurgadin.&nbsp; Amazingly, after the quickest res and buff session you have ever seen, we got Narandi over to the group, killed him and Monq was able to loot the head.&nbsp; It was by far the sloppiest Ring War we have ever done but the last 20 minutes were pure edge of the seat excitement.&nbsp; And now Monq has a Ring 10 so many congrats to him.&nbsp; I've said it before and I'll say it again, sometimes it's better to be lucky than it is to be good. . .</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Dada's Art</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/krion.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/aowsnatch.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/cynisoseggzy.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/iroaxorurboxorz.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/lemmingfuror.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/stanos.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/tigolelover.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/tigzcolon.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/krion_quotd.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/raz_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/reynaldo_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/rhap_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/vin_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_24/voronwe_quote.jpg" border=0></P>
