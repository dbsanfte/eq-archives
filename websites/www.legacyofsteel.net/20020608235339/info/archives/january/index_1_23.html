            <P></P>
            <P align=left>Yesterday was Quest Mob Day.&nbsp; Or at least it was 
            supposed to be.&nbsp; We got off to a good start.&nbsp; 
            <STRONG>Chon</STRONG> is nearing the end of his Ragebringer quest so 
            we got to wax <STRONG>General Viagra</STRONG> in 
            <STRONG>Kithicor</STRONG> as part of the fun.</P>

            <P align=center>General dropped one of these for Sexy Joboba</P>
            <P align=left>After the General died, the plan was to head to 
            Dreadlands and kill <STRONG>Gorenaire</STRONG>.&nbsp; Tork still 
            needs a white scale to complete his SSS quest.&nbsp; We port right 
            from Kith to DL, head to our buff spot.&nbsp; Everyone is grouped 
            and buffing.&nbsp; Suddenly, <STRONG>YOU HAVE BEEN 
            DISCONNECTED</STRONG>.&nbsp; Apparently the whole zone came 
            down.&nbsp; When I was finally able to log back in, I was back at 
            the wizard port in my regular armor (not the resist gear I had on at 
            the buff spot).&nbsp; We send people out to track Gorenaire right 
            away.&nbsp; Of course he's not up with a zone repop.&nbsp; I am 
            beginning to think we are capable of poofing any mob in the 
            game.&nbsp; I like the idea of these outdoor dragons you can go 
            beatdown on at your leisure.&nbsp; But why in god's name would they 
            put one in Dreadlands?&nbsp; There were 100+ people in the zone last 
            night.&nbsp; It's a major port zone. . .people hunt there for 
            exp.&nbsp; Why not stick the freakin dragon in Swamp of No Hope 
            where virtually no one ever hunts?&nbsp; Well, that ranting aside. . 
            .I petitioned the GM at this point to see if there was any hope to 
            get the dragon spawned.&nbsp; A guide responded that the GM was on 
            his lunch break and would get back to me soon. . .</P>
            <P align=left>Sooooooo with a whole gang of people ready to keeel, 
            we had to come up with something fast.&nbsp; Trak was dead.&nbsp; 
            Venril was dead.&nbsp; The Dain was poofed.&nbsp; Velketor was 
            dead.&nbsp; Yelinak was not up.&nbsp; Zlandicar was not up.&nbsp; 
            Gorenaire was MIA.&nbsp; Chardok. . .well Chardok sucks.&nbsp; So to 
            Emerald Jungle we went. . .off to keeel the leezurd.</P>

            <P align=left>Loot was some crap we don't need.</P>
            <P align=left>. . . still waiting for the GM's response on 
            Gorenaire. . .</P>

            <P align=left><FONT size=+0>Talendor actually dropped some good 
            stuff.&nbsp; A Dragon Hero Bracer went to <STRONG>Cyni</STRONG> and 
            a Torbin's Eyepatch went to the <STRONG>Wizard of 
            Ozus.</STRONG></FONT></P>
            <P align=left>At this point the GM gets back to me, "How can I help 
            you."&nbsp; I explain the situation. . .40 people sitting buffed for 
            a dragon. . .getting ready to pull in the next 5 minutes. . .zone 
            comes down. . .blah blah blah. . .can you please spawn the dragon 
            for us?&nbsp; GM tells Tigole, "No."&nbsp; Now I realize that it 
            might go beyond the GM's abilities to make a mob spawn. . 
            .especially a mob like Gorenaire that's on a spawn timer.&nbsp; But 
            I ask anyway, "Out of curiosity, why can't you?"&nbsp; No response. 
            . .</P>
            <P align=left>So that was yesterday.&nbsp; We also killed that ape 
            in Field of Bone for <STRONG>Phalinn's</STRONG> snake quest.</P>
            <P align=left>By the way, all you random stalker-cacksuggers who 
            bugged me about updating the page the past two days. . .I clearly 
            said in the last update there would be no freakin update.&nbsp; 
            Well, just to fill everyone in on what I might have missed we 
            checked out <STRONG>Veeshan's Temple</STRONG> for the first 
time.</P>

            border=0></P>
            <P align=center>Ozus was later disappointed to learn we were doing 
            the "Testing Area"</P>
            <P align=left>What did we get out of our trip to Veeshan's Temple? 
            13pp and some knowledge of what NOT to do.&nbsp; We also got rather 
            owned by a nasty faction bug.&nbsp; We are all warmly to the CoV 
            mobs in the Temple.&nbsp; But if you get ressed near them, there is 
            a chance your faction doesn't "register" quick enough and you get 
            killed.&nbsp; Luckily, GM Valdelmar showed up to check things 
            out.&nbsp; It was good to know that someone from Verant was there to 
            witness a bug-in-action and hopefully help to get it 
            corrected.&nbsp; I keep telling you all, Legacy of Steel is a 
            walking Quality Assurance department for Verant if they wanted it. . 
            .follow us around for a week. . .we'll show ya what's up. =P</P>
