            <P align=left>It seems that the <STRONG>SCREENSHOT</STRONG> feature 
            is disabled for a few days.&nbsp; That sure makes my job a lot of 
            fun.&nbsp; Before all you l33t hax0rs start posting on our board 
            about some program I could use to take screens, just let me wallow 
            in my bitching.&nbsp; My eyes are burning through my goddamn skull 
            from staring at <STRONG>HARSH</STRONG>, <STRONG>GLARING</STRONG>, 
            <STRONG>WHITE</STRONG> all night.&nbsp; Did I mention I 
            <EM>really</EM> hate the fucking snow?&nbsp; I can't read any of the 
            text on those white backgrounds.&nbsp; Looks like whoever made some 
            of those Velious zones played a little too much Super Mario Brothers 
            back in the day.&nbsp; Nothing funner than slippery floors! 
            Ccc.&nbsp; Dear god.&nbsp; Well, I did see some bad-ass stuff and I 
            managed to get a nice upgrade to my old Diamodine Earring.&nbsp; I 
            also saw some bad-ass Mo Faka's that I look forward to watching our 
            guild beat-down very soon.&nbsp; I'm a little wary of killing stuff 
            in Velious because of all the faction rumors flying around.&nbsp; 
            Not to mention that the faction was Fubar'd today so you could not 
            tell which factions you were wrecking.&nbsp; Boy, nothing funner 
            than Mazes, Quests, Slippery Floors and Faction Concerns!&nbsp; 
            Verant, quit reading my mind!</P>
            <P align=left>Oh.&nbsp; We did keeeeel shiznit today.&nbsp; Since 
            they fux0red my screenshot button you'll just have to look at old 
            pictures.&nbsp; Ya, I know the archived news needs updating. . .I'll 
            get to it.&nbsp; Someday.</P>
            <P align=left><STRONG>Venril Sathir</STRONG> dropped <STRONG>Singing

            <P align=left>Our <STRONG>Members Section</STRONG> went live 
            today.&nbsp; Just click on the members thingy up there on the top 
            frame.&nbsp; Abou's is particularly entertaining reading.&nbsp; 
            Members can update/change their info at anytime so keep checking 
            back.&nbsp; I know nothing interests you more than what Tenaj has in 
            his ammo slot.</P>
            <P align=left>Anyway, <STRONG>OogtuugVahn</STRONG> did one hell of a

            a quote?&nbsp; Here's a stinking quote. . .</P>
            <P align=left><EM>Stop sending me random goddamn tells all 
            night.&nbsp; I don't want to tell you how to farm the spiroc lord, I 
            don't feel like telling you how to beat Venril Sathir, I don't want 
            to tell you the stats of my weapons and armor, I don't want to tell 
            you what the current zone I am in looks like, I'm not going to ask 
            my guild for pricechecks on your shitty farmed items, I don't have 
            any old rogue stuff for sale, if I've never spoken to you before - I 
            am not impressed that you are 46 now and in Plane of Fear, I don't 
            want to tell you how to beat Hoshkar, I don't want to tell you what 
            mob I am killing, I have no idea what item is worth more when you 
            tell me two - I kill for my loot, I am just trying to relax and play 
            a game.&nbsp; Thx la~</EM></P>
