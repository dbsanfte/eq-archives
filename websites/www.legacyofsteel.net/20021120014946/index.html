The problem, ccc, was we got jumped by another guild who rushed past and clicked down - nothing, I can assure you, is simple around here~  I rarely want people to fail, unless it's Virginia Tech (Jesus Christ - fucking castrated turkey is their mascot), but I unabashedly was thrilled to fine out the wanna be ninjas had wiped out.  Thanks to Jangos eloquent and stirring words, the Evil Empire swooped down for the win, finally unsealing the Halls of Honor to the Western World.  I'm not sure what Mauvin did, but killing Mith Marr, god of missed LoH's and "We need defensive!!" whiners, is gonna make my day...<p><center>[insert picture of dead dragon that like 50 aholes promised to send me, but didn't]</center><p>And speaking of killing Gods, I've been remiss to mention 7th Hammer going down like Desp on a boy scout a week ago.  It was actually one of more enjoyable aspects of EQ - the late night crew, and with drive, determination and 9 people, we figured wtf how can we lose.  Turns out there were many ways for us to lose, but two evolutions and mild YOU NEVER HELP ME trial drama later, we fielded another group and took him out in back of this courthouse and tried a little bit of his honor on, LoS style:<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/7th.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/l-7th-apron_loot.png> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/l-7th-sword_loot.png></center><p>The trials are a lot of fun, I mean, we pioneered ghetto AE, but I like how the challenges and objectives are laid out such that any particular group composition can win with heads up play.  And like doing trials with 3 or 4, now I'm anxious to get back up there, and see just how few it takes to own that Halas homo.<p>Keeping with killing the cocksuckers, as much as I like CoD, why the fuck does that little pusling give out only 30 keys per kill?  Here I was ready to compliment VI on the planar projections eliminating a lot of my concern with flags (aside from the fact if you miss one flag, you're assfucked for days and possibly longer), and then the little shit poofs on us.  Anyhow, I'd hope with all the competition and cockblocking, intentional or otherwise, VI will reconsider the use of limited flag/key mobs - if you're at the event, you should be put at odds with the rest of your guildmates over who can and cannot progress.<p>All that aside, and me still being in shock over getting PoV dragon, we found Bertox ring not blown!  How fortuitous~  This is another event I really enjoyed, it was a run and gun, hack and slash, frantic race that reminded me a lot of the constant small trains err pulls in PoH (with golem pets).  The multiple fight management and resource coordination was a blast, and after 1h 20m, I hit track and saw...<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/bertox_quote.png><p>Somehow after 80 mins of chaos, the confusion of the pull owned us, but I can't wait for the ring to respawn, this rough mofaka is ours:<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/bertox.jpg><br>So close it hurts~<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/l-bertox-torch_loot.png><br>Random ring loot~</center><p>So, on to other things,<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/bot.jpg><br>Karana, you pussy, I owe you big time for that shit back in SK many levels ago...</center><p>with <strong>Bzul</strong> at the helm~<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/bzul-wai.jpg></center><p>In closing, not that anyone asked me - hey, you're reading the page - but amid the usual retardry on the message boards, <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessage?topicID=3642.topic>someone noted,</a> "Everything has the *feel* that the people that are left, are just kinda playing to pass the time until something new comes out, and everyone can get away from VI/Sony."  And, again, not that he'd have been the first person to say such, but at the time I think it merits some comment.  Right now there are decidedly two camps in EQ, those are caught up in the new expansion and working very hard to explore/exploit it, and yes, those who are passing time - with very few left in between.  The greatest common tie in both, however, remains the people and friendships we've made over the 3+ years of devoting more time to this game than many people do to their jobs - check our your /played sometime and compare it to the average working time per year, about 87 days.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-mud_quote.png><p>What's next, who can say for certain, but if anything MMORPG's, for all their problems, addiction, and Crying Game surprises, have brought together a tremendous number of people and legitimized the nature of net friendships.  The recent fan faires and informal guild RL gatherings are a good indicator this is much more than just a game, and so while people are busy right now, God knows I am, I don't think the community, on the whole, is on the decline.  <p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/s-carb_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/s-chic_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/s-haka_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/s-ir_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/s-lil_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/s-two_quote.png><p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-bender_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-berton_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-desp_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-jangos_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-jmann_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-kat_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-klez-1_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-klez_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-parv_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-polo-1_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-polo_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-powah_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/quavvy.jpg><br>Welcome to Quavvy - who starts thing out right:<br> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-quav_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-raz_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-rey_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-stikk-1_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-tig_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-voro-1_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-stikk_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_17/q-voro_quote.png><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body><a name="newsitem1036975224,3601,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>But When You Were Available, I Was Drinking Colt 45's With Lando</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Sunday, November 10, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork@legacyofsteel.net">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>Cockblocked!</strong></font></center><p>I guess I should be happy I don't know how exactly how many spawns are being blown, like that bad ass Paffa dude on the first wave, but it still bugs the shit outta me VI hasn't yet learned, contrary to their belief the Euro/Asian timezone guilds are upset about patching during primetime,  they could not be happier to have full reign over the server when it comes up.  This problem has been around for a long time, and it's almost passe to bitch and moan about it except the fix is easy...<p>The 3.5 day respawn?  Please.  Unless we pull some gimp shit like PnP a standing raid force, that half day is meaningless - it's just enough extra time to piss people off.  So until we start making the unreasonable request for guildmates to to take days off from work or gank spawns at 6:30 AM PT to compete, we sit here, ass fucked and locked out HoH and Tactics, losing Bertox to griefers who send taunting tells right after the deed.  Good thing BoT is comparable for spec parchments, and PoS is so well laid out, jeje. =P<p>Which brings up an honest question: did anyone even run through PoS and test playability on a required min spec system?  Or more to the point, did anyone even run through with a P4-2.8, 1 GB RAM, GeForce4 Ti-4400 at 640x480, 16 bit color, no models?  There are places in PoS where frame rates drop to 1-7 fps on the above - I can't image what a min spec system would do as the vid card bursts into flames.  A /viewport of 200x200 made it roughly playable again, but I can't fathom that was intended.  Please fix the clip plane when occluded or remove some of the fucking trees.<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/tree.jpg><br>HIGHER!!<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/pos-1.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/pos-2.jpg></center><p>Oh yah, and to add insult to injury, while L61+ rogues now get an innate no-cost  run speed increase faster than SoW while hiding/sneaking, bard fleet of foot is either broken or totally gimped - I don't whine much (jeje), but the description alludes to a significant increase in speed.  What's the deal?<p>So, despite all that shit, the Evil Empire steamrolls on, and I love going into encounters without a clue, flying blind and yelling what lands, what's resisted and suddenly find yourself winning.  Even losing, the thrill of trying it first, of not having it all laid out in Safehouse spoiler threads, of learning from your losses - how, and more importantly why, you, collectively, regroup from such is far more the mark and measure of a guild than hollow wins on someone else's coat tails - I suppose LoS could go it the easy path, but that wouldn't be half the fun or near the drama.  LoS would like to thank <strong>Daelomin</strong> for stepping up and PoP'ing this expansions cherry and we all look forward to seeing the fruits of his labor soon - <strong>Bzul</strong> brings LoS full circle, back to a pulling warrior GM, and as always... all Jangos complains should go to him, not us - we have nothing to do with Jangos, honest.<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/bzul.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-voro_quote.png></center><p>Anyhow, everyone keeps bugging me to post loot - I have to be honest, however, and say that loot is nothing spectacular, I would post it otherwise.  Better stuff drops in CT, but truth be told, I'm fine with this on the lower tier planes.  I've had as much fun as I can recall aside from 1-50, in PoP and the sheer size and need for exploration leaves me hungry for more.  As long as loot scales with that challenge and time commitment, then PoP is going to shape up nicely.  C'mon - have I ever held back from you guys before - am I trying to hide uber leet stuff to prevent it from getting nerfed?  When something kick ass drops for us, you'll be the first to know about it.<p><font size=4><strong>Working As Intended</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/wai-1.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/wai-2.png><p><font size=4><strong>Bad Idea Jeans</strong></font><p>Speaking as a bard in the rogue group, my fellow patriot Zykium &lt;Chaos and Order&gt; on Tarew Marr throws down the gauntlet,<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/raid-xp.gif><p>We didn't fight and win the Cold War for nothing - don't give into those pinko commie monks who whine about pulling and dying!<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/s-kob_quote.png><br>Heh... and I thought I was shameless.<p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/s-bor_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/s-cub_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/s-jej_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/s-lub_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/s-torknot_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/s-torkz_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/s-who_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/s-yat_quote.png><p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-anda_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-apoc_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-arlos_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-berton_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-merc_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-monq_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-polo-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-polo_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-powah_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-raz-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-raz_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-rey-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-rey_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-stik_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-ti-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-tik_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-umpi_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-voro-1_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-voro-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_02/11_10/q-voro-3_quote.png><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body>
