            <P align=left>Hail Lovers, Freaks, Sl00ts, Wanna-be's, EQ junkies, 
            Foolmans, Friends and Lovers of HLS!</P>
            <P align=left>Well, I am still on vacation but this fuggin web site 
            was in dire need of an update.&nbsp; Unfortunately for all of you, I 
            have no graphics programs on this shit-ass laptop so that picture 
            will probably take you a good ten minutes to download unless you're 
            sitting at NASA or some shit.&nbsp; Frankly, I could give a rat's 
            ass how long it takes you -- just be patient it's worth the 
            wait.&nbsp; Thatia once again proves that not only is she the Queen 
            of HLS, she is also an amazingly talented artist.</P>
            <P align=left>So it's overcast as a mo faka today.&nbsp; I've been 
            baking in the sun for so many days in a row now that it's nice to be 
            chilling inside for once.&nbsp; Hell, it's 11:30 in the morning, I'm 
            drinking Corona's and watching the Lakers own the Spurs 
            (again).&nbsp; How bad can life really be?</P>
            <P align=left>Oh wait, I forgot, no one actually gives a shit what I 
            am doing since I am not out raping and pillaging with the asskicking 
            machine known as Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; I spoke with Rhap on the 
            phone the other night and he filled me in on what the guild has been 
            up to.&nbsp; It seems that since I've been out of town Dozekar, 
            Tormax, Zland, Kland, CT and numerous other deserving-to-die beasts 
            have been catapulted to their deaths.&nbsp; Actually, there is even 
            new loot to report.&nbsp; Tormax dropped some KICK ASS gloves -- 
            28ac +6 dex/str/sta +75 HP. . .Of course, Rhap being a lazy drunken 
            son of a sl00t cacksugger didn't bother posting a screenshot of them 
            or emailing one to me, so you'll just have to take my word for 
            it.</P>
            <P align=left>So I know Doze had died a few times since I've been 
            gone but I have no clue what he dropped or if any new quests have 
            been completed.&nbsp; I do know that he did drop one more of the 
            tears toward the four tear quest Leick is working on.&nbsp; We're 
            all pretty excited to see just what four tears from old Doze-slacker 
            aka Doz-e-queer the Cursed can buy.&nbsp; Oooooh, and speaking of 
            Leick, many congrats to my homeboy on getting his Dain Ring.</P>
            <P align=left>Enough rambling for me.&nbsp; There are beers to be 
            drank.&nbsp; If these clouds clear up I've got to deal with the 
            monumental task of moving my lazy ass 100 yards to the beach.&nbsp; 
            I'll be back in business next weekend at which time you can prepare 
            yourself for the ONSLAUGHT of dead mobs this page will be littered 
            with.&nbsp; In the meantime, the mobs will have to keep on dying 
            with no press coverage.&nbsp; I think you'll survive.</P>
            <P align=left>Signing off from the land of the Chi Chi,</P>
