Ever since unveiling "The Pants", Parv has been overwhelmed with accusations of "insider info" and other shadey behavior.&nbsp; After all, how could Parv have acquired the godly Jesus-like item of the trousers-community such as "The Pants" well before anyone else was even close to having so much of a clue as to their existence.&nbsp; Well, suck it up lovers, we've got Parv and Parv has "The Pants" so you are all forced to live in your second-class existence of pantslessness.&nbsp; The quest for "The Pants" is so painstaking and grueling, so time consuming, so incredibly difficult and requires so much skill, we estimate you wont see another Halfling warlord wearing these pants for at least 9 years.&nbsp; Cry nerf if you will, but until we see that &lt;SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE&gt; you can bet your sweet ass we'll be sploiting the power of "The Pants" as hard as it can be sploited.</P><P align=left>First came the Burrower Cacksugger.&nbsp; Our first tank up on the Burrower was Bzul who seemed to instantly go Linkdead.&nbsp; Normally, as I've instructed my guild, when someone goes Linkdead we all /q, succor, evac, gate, train the zone or Ebay our characters.&nbsp; However, inspired by the shining golden brilliance of "The Pants" Parv jumped in and one-tanked the Burrower to it's death.&nbsp; As the luck of "The Pants" would have it, the loot was pretty fuggin phat:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/burrower_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Now that's what we like to see here on The Nameless.&nbsp; Well, that and boobies.&nbsp; After the Burrower died, we went to Ahkeva to work on our Vex Thal faction because we are so damned close to completing our keys all we need is faction.&nbsp; And for the zone to exist.&nbsp; And for the zone to have mobs.&nbsp; And for the zone to have loot.&nbsp; And for there to be&nbsp;a key.&nbsp; And for there to be a key quest.&nbsp; But besides that and our faction, we're ALMOST ready to zone in.&nbsp; By the way, if any of you hurmorless jackasses goes and posts a moronic VT thread in my forums I'm not only going to ban you.&nbsp; So anyway, as we were hard at work on our VT keys, we decided to kill Shei Mallown.&nbsp; The Shei is what we call, in strictly technical terms, a tremendous pillowbiting poooosae.&nbsp; The fight was all fine and dandy until we hit a small "Dumbass Speedbump" and lost like 3 people to enrage. . .Anyone who knows how the Shei works, knows that when someone dies to him, a mob spawns.&nbsp; So you can imagine what it's like when the Jackass Factor&nbsp;gets the best of us, and people forget&nbsp;to press A when those big red letters E-N-R-A-G-E-D show up on the screen.&nbsp; Our biggest fear was that Abru, our lone LoS druid, would be killed. . .:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/jmann_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>In another news I would like to take a moment to talk about my personal life.&nbsp; Today was a very special day for me.&nbsp; In the mail this afternoon, I recieved notice that I had passed the State Bar of Arizona.&nbsp; Along with a very official letter from the State I was happy to get my State Bar of Arizona Identification card, with my name printed on it and my official Bar number.&nbsp; I would like to thank everyone who supported me all those years, the folks who had faith in me and helped me achieve this moment of greatness.&nbsp; Perhaps the thing that makes this truly special (besides the fact that my life as I know it will from this day forth be changed, forever devoted to the Law of the blessed state of Arizona) is the fact that I never took the bar.&nbsp; Nor have I ever lived in Arizona.&nbsp; But I would like to thank the State Bar of Arizona for this fantastic vote of confidence in my legal skills.&nbsp; I eagerly await my first trial and if any of you, my friends, should ever need legal representation in the courts of Arizona, rest assured that I, Tigole Bitties, have been deemed a worthy advisor for all your legal woes.&nbsp; God bless the court systems and god bless our Government.&nbsp; And no, I shit you not, this is 100 percent true -- somehow the jackasses of the State Bar of Arizona passed me, despite the fact I never took a test, don't live in Arizona, never applied and simply was fortunate enough to have the same name as some dumbass searching the back of his mailbox right now wondering if he passed or not.&nbsp; Life is grand sometimes.&nbsp; Maybe I'll move to Tuscon and try to legalize marijauna.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG>    </P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/hairyteabag_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/sisterofssorn_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/thenamelessfilter_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/tigsazzbuddy_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/tijuanadonkygal_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/unoriginalbastard_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the Day</FONT></STRONG>   </P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_11/gullem_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>&nbsp;</P><P align=center><A href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif" border=0></A></P><DIV align=center></DIV></body></html><a name="newsitem1018426052,15377,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Crazy, But That's How It Goes</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Wednesday, April 10, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><html><head>	<title>Untitled</title></head><body><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>  And On The Tenth Day I Updated the Goddamned Website</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_10/legacysite_quote.gif" border=0></FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_10/updatewebpage_quote.gif" border=0></FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_10/al_parv.jpg" border=0></FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=3><EM>Arch Lich Version 6.792 gets Karl Mallowned</EM></FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left>Hrm, where to start.&nbsp; Let's see. . .just about 1 out of 10 tells I get now says something about updating the site, I get emails telling me to update the site, the guild is busting my balls to update the site, even goddamned Rhap, that little bitch, is on my case:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_02/4_10/rhap_header_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>So here it is!&nbsp; The update!&nbsp; Tonight we went for the newest version of Mr. Arch Lich.&nbsp; In spite of knowing his loot table -- most of which sucks a phat cack with one or two Vulak-esque items thrown in -- we wanted to beat him.&nbsp; We want to beat everything.&nbsp; And if they keep changing things, or making them harder, we must kill them.&nbsp; So this guy is a freakin BEAST now.&nbsp; It's hilarious how up and down this mob has been since the release of SoL (the funniest being that week where slow could not be dispelled -- gg VI).&nbsp; Now I would rate him up as one of the more difficult *straight up* fights there are in EQ.&nbsp; In any event, the guild kicked major ass tonight.&nbsp; We could have farmed a dozen easy Velious mobs but instead we opted to work on Seru keys and kill the latest version of Mr. Snake as seen above.</P><P align=left> Speaking of Seru, I can't believe the freakin insanity caused by FoH's killing of that one mob.&nbsp; People have been acting crazy about EQ, serious pyscho bullshit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Folks keep asking my opinion on the whole thing.&nbsp; Well, here's my opinion:&nbsp; Props to them but I don't have a recipe for a Seru-bane weapon so I could give a fuck beyond that.&nbsp; Do we have Seru keys?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Do we have Earrings?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Do we have Seru weaps?&nbsp; No goddamnit.&nbsp; Leave me alone.&nbsp; Don't come asking me for the recipe.&nbsp; We didn't magically *stumble* upon the recipe, so guess who's SoL in SoL?&nbsp; We would have loved to be among the first to kill Seru -- but we weren't.&nbsp; The truth is, from what Furor posted, it sounds like the whole encounter is amazingly fucked up beyond recognition.&nbsp; Let someone else Beta Test it.&nbsp; What it all comes down to is you just have to be satisfied with what YOUR guild is doing on YOUR server.&nbsp; Be happy for others when they do great things -- like killing Seru.&nbsp; And chill the fuck out and quit acting psychotic over a video game.&nbsp; If you're name isn't Furor and you're not the one on the Bard-speed horse with the phatty earring&nbsp; and the Seru kill shot on your hardrive, I suggest focusing on your own goddamn goals and leaving FoH, Furor, and sure as fuck ME alone about the whole deal.</P><P align=left>Aaaaaah. . .now that I got that off my chest. . .I'll share some of the stuff we did recently between ub9r raids that I like to call Guild Ego Boosters!&nbsp;

I schedule the Burrower and AoW and next thing I know we've got 60 people in the raid channel.&nbsp; Granted a few were twinks including my beloved Bitties sitting AFK in Echo Caverns but goddamn, it was NICE having that many people to take on the Burrower and AoW.&nbsp; It was laughable how smooth things went.&nbsp; Feel free to call my a hypocrite, but hot damn, we were a freakin machine tonight.&nbsp; We literally had time to kill between every wave of the burrower circle.&nbsp; For all you chumps that take these big-ass raids to that dong-like nemesis we call the Burrower, I highly recommend you send some of your peeps packing and try it with 40 sometime.&nbsp; 40 people doing the burrower is a damned good time -- pure edge of your seat excitement -- a wipe-out waiting to happen.&nbsp; 60 people? pffffft.&nbsp; Taking candy from a baby.</P><P align=left>AoW was pure magic too.&nbsp; Bzul "Papatank" Target was up for nearly the entire fight.&nbsp; Our clerics simply own.&nbsp; I love talking to people from other guilds because they always bitch about how bad their clerics suck.&nbsp; Yes, modesty be damned, I'll say it right here:&nbsp; LoS has the best goddamned healing in the game.&nbsp; The best part?&nbsp; They refuse to use a cheal rotation =PPPP</P><P align=left>So we killed the Burrower and Mr. Ei Oh Dubya like it was freaking Mooto and Slaythe and then we went off to wax some fool in Seru so we can get a key to&nbsp;a mob that we can kill when the moon aligns with Jupiter and then I decide to log early for once.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that sleep is for the weak.&nbsp; 6 hours is sleeping in for this homey.&nbsp; But for once in my goddamn life I decide that tonight, especially considering what a FINE night it was, I am going to go to bed early so that I can wake up extra early to TCB as the King called it.&nbsp; Takin' Care of Business baby.&nbsp; Well, I log off and am just about to get into bed when I hear a noise from coming from the other room. . .</P><P align=left>This is odd, I think to myself.&nbsp; I walk into my office and what do I see?&nbsp; My goddamned dog is standing ON the fucking desk with his head buried in&nbsp;a bag of Cadbury's Chocolate Eggs.&nbsp; As our Jesus-worshipping readers know, Sunday was Easter.&nbsp; My mom had given me those chocolate eggs and absent mindedly I left the bag on my desk.&nbsp; Leave it to my 18 pound little cacksugging bastard of a dog to find a way to jump onto the goddamned desk and eat the entire bag of chocolate eggs.&nbsp; Somewhere, in a galaxy far far away, I had once heard that chocolate is apparently bad for dogs.&nbsp; My first thought was to shove my finger down the little mo faka's throat and make him yuke it up.&nbsp; But then I considered the mess that would make and also the general violent nature of such an act.&nbsp; He might only weigh 18 pounds but Jack Russells have jaws like a fucking Mako shark.&nbsp; I wasn't about to lose a digit trying to get little Jack to "yell Europe".</P><P align=left>My second thought was, "Well, fuck the little bastard -- he made his bed, let him lie in it."&nbsp; And I was just going to go to bed.&nbsp; I mean he looked fine.&nbsp; Sure an 18 pound dog on a few pounds of chocolate is as strung out and hyper as Pookie from New Jack City in a Cocoa field, but hey, he gets what he deserves.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; But then I started feeling a tinge of guilt.&nbsp; Or something.&nbsp; I mean what if chocolate is really bad for the dude and sometime in the middle of the night he croaks.&nbsp; Mondays and Thursdays are trash nights after all so I wouldn't be able to chuck the corpse for 3 more days.&nbsp; Or what if he shit or puked all over the place?</P><P align=left>So being the animal rights activist I am, I call this emergency animal hotline.&nbsp; This girl answers the phone and I tell her my dog just ate a shit-ton of chocolate.&nbsp; At this point I am just praying she says, "Chill baby lover, he'll be a-ok."&nbsp; Instead she starts asking all the details then tells me I better bring him in.&nbsp; Well, fucking great.&nbsp; So I gotta schlep my little cacksugging dog halfway to Sierra Madre in the middle of the night.&nbsp; On the upside I am thinking, "Hey, that girl sounded kinda cute. . .this might not be so bad. . ."&nbsp; But I get there and instead of some cute vet assistant I gotta deal with some tired old guy who makes me hold my cacksugging animal while he shoves a thermometer up his ass long enough to take his temperature.&nbsp; And what difference does that even make?&nbsp; He ate goddamn chocolate.&nbsp; Make him puke and get it over with.</P><P align=left>Once the assistant is done with the dog, he calls in the Vet who I swear to god was that Nazi war criminal doctor.&nbsp; So Doctor Mengela tells me he's got to give Jack (my little motherfucker) some medicine or IV or god knows what to *purge his system* and then once that's done he's got to give him something to make the *purging of the system* come to an end.&nbsp; Segue to two hours later. . .the dog is fine.&nbsp; Two hours and two-hundred dollars later and my chocolate eating bitch of an animal gets to live.</P><P align=left>I swear to god, the next time Jack decides to eat chocolate the problem is going to cost me the price of one Hefty bag to fix.&nbsp; Somewhere out there my ex-girlfriend, the thankless bitch who begged me for that dog in the first place, is out there laughing.&nbsp; And goddamn she was useless.&nbsp; Who cares if she could suck a golfball through a garden hose?&nbsp;
