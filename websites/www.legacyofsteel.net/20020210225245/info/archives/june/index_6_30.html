            <P align=left>Today you'll have to indulge me in a little 
            rant.&nbsp; I'm sitting here waiting for my ride to show up -- gonna 
            be gone until Sunday night.&nbsp; But this game just has me thinking 
            right now. . .more like boggling.&nbsp; Now, we all knew the 
            upgraded North Wing loots were coming.&nbsp; They *needed* to be 
            upgraded.&nbsp; Crap was dropping for the effort required to kill 
            that stuff.&nbsp; But the reason they upgraded was for balance 
            right?&nbsp; All of what I have to say is null and void if you 
            disregard the notion of balance.&nbsp; Please work with me here, 
            Pro-Giant people, I put up with your months of whining -- I even 
            backed you up.&nbsp; Now look at things from a Pro-CoV 
            perspective.</P>
            <P align=left>We're stuck with one goddamned "boss mob" in ToV. 
            Dozekar the Gimped.&nbsp; Perhaps if we still had the "old Doze" to 
            contend with I wouldn't be so anxious to post this rant.&nbsp; By 
            Old Doze, some of you actually know what I am talking about.&nbsp; 
            For those of you who have no clue what I am saying, please go back 
            to Karnors and continue to bask in your clueslessness.&nbsp; 
            Basically, Dozekar is or will be the Venril Sathir of late Kunark -- 
            a.k.a Clusterfuck Mob of the Expansion.&nbsp; The symbols from the 
            named drakes are an equal dick in the ass.&nbsp; Let's not even look 
            at this from a loot perspective for a minute.&nbsp; From an 
            excitement-thrill-of-the-kill perpective we get the shaft.&nbsp; 
            Pro-Giant people have Telk, Goz, Lenidara, Lord Vyemm, Vulak, etc 
            etc etc etc to&nbsp;kill.&nbsp; More boss mobs then there is time in 
            the day.&nbsp; Now, don't be a cacksugger and say to me, "Well, you 
            have Statue, Vind, Tormax."&nbsp; How bout fucking Yelinak and all 
            of Skyshrine?&nbsp; How bout a 3 month head start on Sleepers?</P>
            <P align=left>Anyway, Pro-Dragon people want THINGS TO KEEEL.&nbsp; 
            I don't care about the goddamned loot.&nbsp; The ToV quest loot is 
            going to be so rare, it doesn't matter anyway.&nbsp; We're lucky to 
            complete 3 quests out of 4 Dozekar kills right now (4 doze spawns = 
            1 month).&nbsp; What happens a few months from now when other guilds 
            are Doze-capable?&nbsp; It's a fucking joke -- and even Pro-Giant 
            people know it is.</P>
            <P align=left>Here are the solutions I feel would best address this 
            gross imbalance:</P>
            <P align=left>A)&nbsp; Dozekar drops LOOT in addition to 
            tears.&nbsp; And please, give us old Doze back.&nbsp; Likewise, the 
            named drakes drop 4-8 symbols each time.&nbsp; These should spawn 
            every 3 days AT LEAST, including Doze.</P>
            <P align=left>B)&nbsp; Add some loot to the named drakes -- buff 
            them up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make them hard mo fakas. . .make them so hard 
            it makes farming armor virtually impossible with them up.&nbsp; Give 
            them random drops like those that exist in North ToV.</P>
            <P align=left>C)&nbsp; Remove the faction from North ToV.&nbsp; Give 
            Telk, Lendinara and Gozz in the West Wing Dozekar-equivalent loot 
            (so the Pro-Giant people don't bust a nut whining).&nbsp; Pro-Giant 
            gets 3 dragons, Pro-CoV gets 1, everyone has a shot at the North 
            Wing mobs.&nbsp; This is the best option in my opinion.</P>
            <P align=left>D) If you're going to be a bunch of cacksuggers and 
            not let us hunt in North ToV, put Doze and the HoT mobs on 
            +Guardians of Veeshan and +Claws of Veeshan faction.&nbsp; This is 
            the worst option but at least you'd be throwing us the small bone of 
            being able to get a shot at PoM.&nbsp; Sure there's nothing more 
            than a minor fascination with PoM, but we can pass our time there 
            while waiting 7 days for Dozekar to spawn and drop his 2 tears.</P>
            <P align=left>E) You're not going to give us anything more to kill 
            in ToV? Fine. . .give us Undead Kael or some shit.&nbsp; Or add 10 
            BOSS level mobs to Kael with HUGE faction hits so Pro-Giant people 
            stay the fuck away.&nbsp; Make sure to load them with 12/16 daggers 
            and 14/18 whips. . .ac 90 breastplates while you're at it.&nbsp; 
            Sounds fair now, right?</P>
            <P align=left>Make me God of Everquest and I choose OPTION C 
            (although E sounds pretty fun too).</P>
            <P align=left>Right now, VI has created two choices:&nbsp; 1) Go 
            Pro-Giant, get fat loots, face many challenges. or 2) Go Pro-Dragon, 
            farm fat loots. . .zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</P>
            <P align=left>Ok I am done ranting.&nbsp; I don't want you Pro-Giant 
            bitches coming and whining to me on our messageboards.&nbsp; I never 
            called for any nerf.&nbsp; What I am asking for is for CoV to be 
            MORE DIFFICULT as a matter of fact.&nbsp; There is more to balance 
            then just placing *nice items* in different locations.</P>
            <P align=left>There's my rant.&nbsp; Of course, this is MY opinion 
            not necessarily that of anyone in my guild.&nbsp; And like I said, 
            before accusing me of merely whining, look at things from my 
            perspective first.</P>
