Add to that the fact that we've always gotten nice loot out of it and you know why we like it.&nbsp; Apparently, the burrower now drops up to 4 items instead of the usual 1.&nbsp; Normally, I'd think this was a good thing considering that for the encounter you really do need a mid to large sized raid.&nbsp; You wont be hearing about too many 24-30 person burrower kills (at least not for a few weeks).&nbsp; So it makes sense that this cacksugger worm drops more than one thing:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/burrower_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/ringoflivingore_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Now I know some of you are gonna tell me how cool that ring is.&nbsp; But the truth is, if you ask me (and well you didn't but I write the goddamned webpage so deal with it) it sucks.&nbsp; Why does this ring suck?&nbsp; Well, anyone who is capable of doing the burrower spawn has probably killed Vulak numerous times, can kill the AoW or is close, can do the Ring War and is capable of killing the numerous other "uber" mobs.&nbsp; The majority of casters in our guild would prefer a Ring of Destruction, Crystasia's Ring, a Ring of Sky or a Dain Ring to this.&nbsp; Shit, even Ring of Shissar is better.&nbsp; Yeah yeah yeah yeah it has Flowing Thought.&nbsp; But because it lacks HP or Mana, the FT II seems kind of insignifigant.&nbsp; This thing is really second tier loot off a first tier mob right now.&nbsp; I don't know -- seems like all it's lacking to make it really nice are a few hit points, some mana or else an increase in the FT value beyond the mere II it has now.&nbsp; Casters should want a burrower ring more than a ring that drops in Fungus Grove off of exp mobs -- don't ya think?</P><P align=left>Right about now half the people just stopped reading so they can write their l33t Tigole flame in the General Forum telling me how awesome this ring is, how it doesn't suck, how I am the devil and for me to stop whining.&nbsp; Fine, whatever.&nbsp; You gotta trust me on this one though.&nbsp; Once you are actually capable of routinely killing this mob, this loot ain't gonna meant jack or shit to you.&nbsp; And the rogue dagger that dropped is second tier too.&nbsp; Yeah, it's an AWESOME rogue dagger -- please spare me the song and dance.&nbsp; But for anyone killing burrower beast, it ain't a high priest dagger, it ain't a vulak dagger and it ain't a tunare dagger.&nbsp; See where I am going with this?&nbsp; Probably not.</P><P align=left>Like I said, getting suck loot was the first sign of trouble.&nbsp; Next thing you know, the suck simply rubbed off on us.&nbsp; We went from absolutely destroying stuff just last week, to spending half our time at our bind points.&nbsp; First sign of trouble was a High Priest raid gone bad.&nbsp; The encounter is pretty fuggin hard now, for those of you who have not tried it.&nbsp; It wasn't exactly cake before.&nbsp; Well, we get everyone up there and they are doing just fine.&nbsp; We had around 40 people, about 10-20 people shy of what I would ideally like for that raid but oh well, you do the best with what ya got, right?&nbsp; So like a total dumbass, I allow for agro transfer to get to from the High Priest, through the golem room, to my guild.&nbsp; What does this mean? Cliff notes please?&nbsp; This means there are a shitload of mobs on AUTO pull to my guild and it's pretty much my fucking fault for being a dumbass.&nbsp; Nothing like getting 40 of your good friends Karl Mallowned late at night and wasting their evening on a long CR.&nbsp; That was s-u-c-k at it's finest with no one to blame but myself.</P><P align=left>So the next day rolls around and the tells start rolling in that the Idol of Rallos Zek is up.&nbsp; Looks like the ol' Idol is bugged and training on Arena groups so it's our job to come kill it.&nbsp; Well, I wish I could give some excuse but we just flat out sucked on the AoW.&nbsp; I mean he just bent us over -- it wasn't even close.&nbsp; We die, we re-group, we pull again.&nbsp; Actually had a fairly decent second run at him at until about 40 percent and then the shit just hits the fan again.&nbsp; So dying to the AoW really sucked.&nbsp; Dying twice was uber suck.&nbsp; We decide to go to Ssrae and kill the Arch Lich cause after all he is the biggest joke around, right?&nbsp; Next thing you know we train 8 Crypt Guardians on the guild which was pretty much a wipe out.&nbsp; Then we lose to the Arch Lich somehow.&nbsp; Yes that's right.&nbsp; You heard it here first.&nbsp; WE LOST TO THE GODDAMN ARCH LICH.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; I honestly do not know. . .How did Sweden lose to Belarus?&nbsp; Who fucking knows but shit happens right?</P><P align=left>At this point I start getting angry.&nbsp; Not at anyone but myself.&nbsp; So I go AFK and decide to start a load of laundry -- you know, do something productive, get away from the pure suck that is happening in EQ.&nbsp; Well, I break the fucking washing machine instead.&nbsp; Then I go to get my mail (because I have to do laundry and get my mail past midnight since I call my neighbors names like "fat fucking fuck" to their faces making neighborly chit-chat at the mailbox or in the laundry room rather awkward) and there by the mailbox the landlord hangs a sign that reads something like, "Required By Law of the State of California:&nbsp; This area is known to contain chemicals that cause cancer and reproductive harm."&nbsp; Or some such consumer-doomsday nonsense.&nbsp; Good fucking god!!&nbsp; What chemicals are in the goddamn mailbox?&nbsp; Why of all days did the motherfucker have to hang the sign during the week of suck?&nbsp; What is happening?</P><P align=left>I guess I got off the subject.&nbsp; Wait correction, I don't think I was ever on subject.&nbsp; If it makes anyone feel better -- your heroes, Legacy of Steel (yes it's our webpage goddamnit) -- managed to kill the Arch Lich in a Flawless victory. . .well, flawless except for Despim's two suck-ass pets who died.&nbsp; So hopefully the victory at the end of the night was a sign that we are now done with our sucking and can go back to being uber, being porn stars, and getting phat lewtz.&nbsp; That also means that the rest of you who aren't in our guild can go back to being gimps and exploiters.&nbsp; That's how it works right?&nbsp; Please recognize my sarcasm -- I am apparently dying slowly to mysterious mailbox chemicals.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/askiiboobs_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/ghettoaegroop_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/holytigole_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/namlessfilter_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/nicessraloot_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/pnishead_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/raloszek_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/tiggybalboa_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/tigolelikezmenz_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/tigolescackitch_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/tigolzritenad_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>Do other people go AFK and find tells like this when they scroll back. . . .?</P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/tigshairyvagina_quote.gif" border=0></P><P>This dude sounds bitter about something but I like his ideas:</P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/verantceo_quote.gif" border=0></P><P>And finally the obligatory "update the site" stalker. . .</P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/webpage_quote.gif" border=0></P><P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/line_quote.gif" border=0></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/meto_quote.gif" border=0></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/voronwe_quote.gif" border=0></P><P><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_13/wangho_quote.gif" border=0></P></body></html><a name="newsitem1015451343,41510,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>People Don't Ya Understand?</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Wednesday, March 6, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><html><head>	<title>Untitled</title></head><body><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>Welcome To The Ghetto</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/ghetto_ae_main.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>When the Shadows of Luclin expansion went live we saw the return of the much dreaded "exp group".&nbsp; Sure, we remember spending hours on end watching that yellow bar creep at a snail's pace across our screen (yeah, you whippersnappers today are spoiled with this blue line bullshit).&nbsp; We'd sit in dungeons as one lucky puller would bring one or two mobs to the group.&nbsp; Nothing like sitting in one corner for hours at an end.&nbsp; Well, with SoL we started to see the "AE group" in action.&nbsp; Now, on The Nameless, we hate these elitist AE cacksuggers.&nbsp; Fuggin wizards and enchanters who want nothing to do with melee.&nbsp; Suddenly you have monks soloing mushrooms and wizards getting all the groups.&nbsp; Then there were the "rest of us" -- rogues and what not that just sort of tagged along to any group we could get.&nbsp; Personally, I lived in Ssrae for months camping those goddamn keys.&nbsp; But I finally got all my keys, all my rare components, all my "campable" shiznat.&nbsp; And I am straight up bored to tears with exp.&nbsp; I don't care if you give rogues the AA ability to cheal, DA, reserruct, AE sunstrike -- I am goddamn bored of "grinding" exp.&nbsp; I wont do it.&nbsp; End of story.</P><P align=left>Then the beloved Sloot of all Sloots, Jangos, comes to me and tells me about "The Ghetto AE Group".&nbsp; My first reaction was, hey fuck yourself -- those cacksugger wizards and enchanters wont give me the time of day.&nbsp; But the Ghetto AE Group is a totally different story.&nbsp; Anyone is welcome.&nbsp; Just be ready to have your ass handed to you if you don't know what you're doing.&nbsp; So far the Ghetto AE Groups have consisted of 2 Shaman, 2 Bards, 1 Rogue and 1 cleric and another featured 1 warrior, 1 druid, 1 shaman, 1 cleric, 1 bard and a rogue.&nbsp; Dungeon of choice:&nbsp; Howling Stones.&nbsp; OS and KC are very nice as well but the problem is the way Ghetto AE works, we'd end up getting warned or banned when the pooooooosaes in OS or KC (who enjoy calling "non-existent" camps and sitting on their ass for hours at an end) complain that we are "stealing spawns" or "training" when in fact we are just owning shit like it was meant to be owned.</P><P align=left>So it's off to HS!&nbsp; First stop, the zone in of course.&nbsp; This is where we pull all the golems, the two zone in mobs and all the "picture room" mobs from North, West and South wings.&nbsp; The best part of this pull is the fact that at any moment some innocent fool can zone in and be greeted with 20 mobs!</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/ghetto_ae_1.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center>Actually I just wanted to show off my 32k bow shot to make Rangers squirm. . .</P><P align=left>As soon as you clear the enitre front entrance of HS in one pull, it's time to clear North Wing in two pulls!</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/ghetto_ae_2.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/ghetto_ae_corpses.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Next stop, West Wing in two pulls!&nbsp; Then it's down to the pits.&nbsp; The pits, depending on the group, are a one or two pull affair. . .one pull being ideal:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/ghetto_ae_pit.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center>Weeeeeee, look at those yellow exp messages. . .</P><P align=left>The whole theme of the Ghetto AE Group is, "If we don't come close to dying, we're not trying hard enough."&nbsp; Currently, the record number of mobs in one pull stands at 23.&nbsp; Now I know you mo faka elitist caster AE groups will scoff at that with your 40 mob pulls and what not.&nbsp; But we're talkin' G-H-E-T-T-O AE group here folks.&nbsp; Honestly, this is probably the most fun I have had in Everquest ever.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with gaining experience toward AA points -- it's all about being as wreckless as possible, coming close to dying (or dying) and sitting at home simply laughing my ass off.&nbsp; So to those of you on The Nameless if you happen to see the Ghetto AE Group in a dungeon near you, remember, that's not a train -- that's our pull goddamnit.&nbsp; Oh, and please don't whine.</P><P align=left>So what else is new with LoS?&nbsp; Lemme see. . .um, we went to Veeshan's Peak because we were bored.&nbsp; Here's a picture of Phara Dar and Xygoz dead:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/pd_xygoz_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>So I am challenging my guild for the next run:&nbsp; We need a picture of 3 dead dragons together.&nbsp; Or 4.&nbsp; I think it's possible.</P><P align=left>We also killed the Arch Lich and the Creator again.&nbsp; Those mobs are becoming a regular snooze-fest.&nbsp; I really hope they fix the goddamn Arch Lich AE or set it back to the old one sans bugs this time.&nbsp; Either that or load up the Arch Lich to drop 10 helms, 10 sleeves and a Tendonslicer for Rhap (yeah, he wants one for some reason) and we can never go back to AL again.&nbsp; This is the part where one of you whiney bitches flames me on the messageboards for "getting things while their easy then wanting things hard for everyone else."&nbsp; Sorry chump, it don't work that way.&nbsp; I want things hard FOR US but we'll take this easy bullshit as a reward for beta-testing for the farming you will do a few months from now.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/creator_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/thecreator_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>Creator dead, one death, a mage who charged the room first -- hahahahaha.</P><P align=left>We also did ToV for the first time in something like two months.&nbsp; I was ALLY to CoV to put it in perspective.&nbsp; I did 0 faction work, that was just from Statue/Idol/AoW kills.&nbsp; Feeling ashamed of my CoV faction, as if I was somehow a lousy dragon-killer, we went and killed the only two mobs up in ToV at the time -- Aaryonar and Dagarn.&nbsp; I thought Aar was really fun the way he is now.&nbsp; A semi-difficult encounter if you fight it like it was meant to be done.&nbsp; So Aar and Dagarn are dead and we're thinking we cannot come to ToV and not try the famed "Ring of Vulak" before leaving.&nbsp; I decide to be a responsible leader and "scout" the ring before sending the troops in.&nbsp; I run in there, trigger the spawn, get a wurm and some drakes on me and die as expected.&nbsp; We take notes on what spawned where, where the DT drakes spawned etc.&nbsp; So we wait for it to reset and then go to trigger the Ring with the entire guild and this happens:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/RoV_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>And so on and so on. . .whole guild dead in 1 second.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/RoV_adorean_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>I guess I am a dumbass and have no clue what I am doing.&nbsp; Obviously&nbsp;we did something wrong for that DT to happen because as we all know, the Ring of Vulak is for all intents and purposes "working as intended" according to VI.&nbsp; If it is in fact, working as intended, I question the design choice that creates an encounter where one small screw-up by one person leads to 40 people dying instantly requiring a necro CR which as we all know takes hours (only because everyone who plays the warrior class seems to die in WW whenever they enter that zone).&nbsp; If nothing else, the Ring of Vulak was the comedy highlight of the week.</P><P align=left>Ok, time for a new section of the web page.&nbsp; I really don't even know where this came from.&nbsp; Let's just call it, Potty Talk.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Potty Talk</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/tork_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/manalope_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/wangho_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/allenginsberg_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>Well, romantic is the last word I would use to describe Ginsberg's work but I was glad someone recognized the source =P</P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/despp_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/ixnayslawyer_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/lawyerofvi_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/legacyofsorrow_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/loordseru_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/mastercardletme_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/rombiis_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/tigmolestor_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/tigolenuttsack_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/updatecacksite_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/vinsharyr_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left>And here's how the guide staff feels about you guys:</P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/guide_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/berton_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_02/3_6/crazz_quote.gif" border=0></P></body></html>
