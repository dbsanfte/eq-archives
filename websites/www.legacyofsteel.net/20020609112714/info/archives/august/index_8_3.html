            <P align=left><STRONG>An Unrelated Story</STRONG> </P>
            <P align=left>Many years ago when I was in elementary school I 
            remember meeting this kid named VInny on the playground.&nbsp; VInny 
            seemed like a nice guy.&nbsp; He invited me to play a game with 
            him&nbsp; At first,&nbsp;I was unfamiliar with the game.&nbsp; 
            Slowly VInny explained all the rules to me.&nbsp; They were 
            complicated but I learned quickly.&nbsp; After awhile, I got to be 
            so good at the game, that I kept beating VInny.&nbsp; Poor VInny had 
            some ego issues it seemed because each time I would beat him at his 
            own game, he would change the rules on me.&nbsp; Man, VInny was a 
            spoiled brat.&nbsp; I think he grew up and works for 
            some&nbsp;computer company in San Diego now. . .</P>
            <P align=left><STRONG>In other news. . .</STRONG></P>
            <P align=left>As most of you know Kael was brought down last night 
            and patched.&nbsp; The ability to charm the majority of mobs in the 
            zone was removed.&nbsp; You don't need to be a rocket scientist to 
            figure out the reason for this nerf was because of the recent AoW 
            killings by LoS/SoS.&nbsp; While our victories over the AoW were 
            perfectly within the rules of the game, VI decided to alter those 
            rules.&nbsp; I've read that there are over 300,000+ Everquest 
            subscribers.&nbsp; I find it fascinating that a company took the 
            time to alter their game to basically say "screw you" to 80 of those 
            300.000+.&nbsp; What's worse is, this nerf wasn't a "thumbed nose" 
            at LoS/SoS for killing their "unkillable" mob.&nbsp; This nerf 
            affects a vast array of people.</P>
            <P align=left>Enchanters you are now buff whores.&nbsp; Time to 
            start a rogue.</P>
            <P align=left>Druids lost their ability to charm wolves.&nbsp; Back 
            to casting PoG and dying after your first fire debuff.&nbsp; Hey I 
            think the Monk needs SoW -- zone out to WL.</P>
            <P align=left>Exp groups and Armor Farmers now have to deal with 
            uncharmable giants.</P>
            <P align=left>Smaller guilds who used pet tanks on Vind and Statue 
            can no longer use those methods.</P>
            <P align=left>Many claim the AoW is now unkillable.&nbsp; I haven't 
            decided yet.&nbsp; Give me a few tries and I'll get back to you on 
            that one.</P>
            <P align=left>Perhaps instead of bringing down Kael, Verant should 
            have re-patched Everquest and removed all classes but 
            Warriors/Clerics/Rogues/Wizards and while they are at it they can 
            remove CoV faction from the game.&nbsp; Not that anyone had much 
            reason to be on CoV faction in the first place (thanks Dozekar NERF, 
            2 tears per kill), but this is like the last "fuck you" that CoV 
            guilds are going to stand for.&nbsp; With ALL the things wrong with 
            this game -- BROKEN quests, BUGGED pathing, WARPING mobs, endless UI 
            GLITCHES -- Verant takes the time to bring down a zone because 80 
            people out of 300,000+ killed ONE mob?&nbsp; Not only that but their 
            solution is to fuck over enchanters, druids, anyone on CoV 
            faction?&nbsp; Of course no one is surprised.&nbsp; We've seen 
            countless nerfs.&nbsp; But this honetsly has to be one of the most 
            RETARDED, knee-jerk reactions I've ever witnessed.</P>
            <P align=left>We're not your goddamned beta testers.&nbsp; We're not 
            your Quality Assurance department.&nbsp; Either start sending me 
            paychecks or cut out this "live beta test" bullshit.</P>
            <P align=left>You want Dragons dead and not Giants? Fine, here's 
            your fucking dead dragon:</P>

            <P align=center>How bout fixing the fucking wall panel?&nbsp; Bring 
            down Skyshrine and fix THAT you
