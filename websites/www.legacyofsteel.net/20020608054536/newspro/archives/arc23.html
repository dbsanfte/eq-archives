<P align=left><HR><STRONG>For Oft When On My Couch I Lie In Vacant or In Pensive Mood</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, February 21, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>Obligatory Uber d00d Picture</FONT>      </STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/tig_and_emp.jpg" border=0></STRONG></P><P align=left>Well looky here. . .if it's not Mr. Emperor Ssraeshza.&nbsp; I felt as though my precious cack would diminish in size&nbsp;if I could not present to you all a photo of myself and the Big Bossman of the Temple.&nbsp; You have no idea how long it took me to get that picture taken.&nbsp; I had to camp through about 30 walls before I could finally sploit my way up to the big mo faka snake that's waiting patiently to be killed.&nbsp; Unfortunately or maybe fortunately (only time will tell) getting keys is a pain in the ass.&nbsp; So unless this bitch can be dropped by me and 3 others, well, he ain't dying on The Nameless soon.&nbsp; I shouldn't speak to fast.&nbsp; I think I might have found a nice pathing sploit in that lava.&nbsp; A little Muscle Lock IV, some high damage arrows and a whole lot of running and that bitch is mine.</P><P align=left>In other news, our webhost told us that by the end of the week our site was going to be deleted.&nbsp; So if suddenly you click on that bookmark and get ye ol' 404 error, well, you know what happened.&nbsp; Apparently, and I am sure some limpdick is going to correct me on this, our site, since January One legacyofsteel.net has gotten 18 **MILLION** hits.&nbsp; I guess this would all be fine and dandy if we had a web d00d who knew just what the fuck he is doing.&nbsp; But instead you get me.&nbsp; Because I left so many images on the front page, and up to a week of updates using lousy compression, we were moving 6 GIGS per **DAY** of traffic.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; Well, luckily we have some web pimps around here who gave me a swift kick in the nuts and got things straightened out.&nbsp; Barnabuss, infamous Dorf of Britannica, has come up with a new News Archiving system.&nbsp; Eventually all the old updates will be convereted to this.&nbsp; Barn also is responsible for the awesome Gallery section.&nbsp; Anyway, that's your warning for the night -- if suddenly los.net doesn't exist tomorrow -- just sit tight and chill until we find a host who can handle our traffic.</P><P align=left>So getting on to what's been dying. . .well mostly us.&nbsp; We've found some really cool shit and have been having fun coffining the guild all over Norrath.&nbsp; Like I am going to tell you what. . .HAW.&nbsp; I am loving the newfound breathing space that now exists.&nbsp; But yeah, we still kill some&nbsp;*cough*&nbsp;shit here and there so we can feel ub9r l33t and so that everyone in the EC tunnel knows we have 12 inch limp dicks when they inspect us.</P><P align=left>&nbsp;</P><P align=left>For example, we killed that OH SO HARD Thought Overfiend again!&nbsp; Only to keep things interesting (cause goddamn that's a boring fight) we let a naked bard tank.&nbsp; Don't believe me?</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/tho_jangos.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>We got so bored during that fight we stopped slowing him =////&nbsp; (cue gimp at home/office:&nbsp; Note to self, THO can be slowed!).&nbsp; Xalxin actually fell asleep -- I shit you not.</P><P align=left>We also killed the IV again.&nbsp; I believe this was the Serverwide FIRST killing of IV version 3.2456 beta:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/iv_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>He dropped his usual shitty crown along with this thingy:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/ribcracker_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>We also all died a horrible death to the Shei Whateverthefuck.&nbsp; I feel pretty good about it.&nbsp; We had never even seen the guy up before so it was our first time targetting him and pressing A.&nbsp; He got to half-dead before he killed us all in one masive, AE deathtouch.&nbsp; He was fun and we went in with almost no l33t insider info.&nbsp; Fucking Commisioner Gordon was slacking on the other end of the Batphone.&nbsp; Anyway, here's a picture of the dude who killed LoS tonight:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/shei_pic.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Ok, before I STFU, please remember that the site might tank soon.&nbsp; Don't come bugging me about it.&nbsp; I am perfectly aware when my goddamn website doesn't work.&nbsp; I don't need Tigolessmallcackwebsitedown telling me the website doesn't work.&nbsp; Things are a bit hectic right now in real life too so chill the fuck out if you go a few days staring at the same bullshit.&nbsp; Yeah, yeah, I have a real life. . .hard to believe, isn't it?</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Dada's Art</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/quee.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</STRONG></FONT></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/baytter_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/loins_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/mariolemieux_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/parasiteburower_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/partywhor_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/savvyfansclub_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/savvystwin_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/tigoleskitties_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/wronggserver_quote.gif" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left>Parv comments on our latest MNK/BST loot:</P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/parv_quote.gif" border=0></P>
