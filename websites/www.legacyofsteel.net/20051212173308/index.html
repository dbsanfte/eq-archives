You see, we've been hammering away at the Demiplane of Blood all week, working our way through Tier 1.  Through the boredom of some encounters to the poor pathing of others, one could say that at least it is an exact copy of a previous zone, but I'm not going to get into that ball of wax.<br><br>Research and Development hasn't let us down in this zone yet, as we have been able to come up with the required strategies to down two new mobs in this zone.<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/Dec_05/Hatchetdead.jpg" width="989" height="578" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><br><br>Those feet belong to Hatchet the Torturer, who oddly enough closely resembles a few mobs we have seen before in EverQuest.  The feet shot is directly due to the "Push" experiment gone extremely wrong and the tendency for this mob-type to fall forwards when dead.  I'll try to get a full body shot next time, promise.<br><br>But that's not all we've done.  There are three sisters who are all fighting for the attention of "The Master" who we wanted to play with as well.  I'm not sold on this encounter, it's fairly easy once you get the gist of it, the hardest part is keeping the raid focus somewhere other than on their Televisions while this thing is going on.  It is a new type of encounter, and one I'm not terribly excited about, to be honest.<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/Dec_05/Sisterswin.jpg" width="833" height="77" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><br><br>So, those three girls were backstabbing each other trying to win the favor of the Master.  Is it just me, or do you think that some of the developers need to find a date a little more often?<br><br>At any rate, we were able to acquire some new goodies from our past week's endeavors.  <br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/Dec_05/Loot_Azureslippers.jpg" width="425" height="264" alt="" border="0" align=""><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/Dec_05/Loot_Bootsofsaint.jpg" width="421" height="283" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/Dec_05/Loot_Eulogy.jpg" width="458" height="269" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/Dec_05/Loot_Azuregloves.jpg" width="452" height="298" alt="" border="0" align=""><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/Dec_05/Loot_Sistershawl.jpg" width="426" height="207" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/Dec_05/Loot_GoldLyre.jpg" width="424" height="217" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><br><br>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br><font size="5" face="Arial Black"><font color="#FF8000">Tele's Top Five:</font></font><br><br>1.

I'm not sure why these aspects have come to the surface yet again, but I'm almost certain that it wasn't intentional.  I firmly believe that the developers currently working on the game we all enjoy experiencing day after day want to create a challenging yet fun experience for those of us who like to live out on the edge where there are no spoilers, walkthroughs or batphones.  What is it about the latest expansion that harkens back to Veeshan's Peak and Plane of Hate V1.0?  We have trash mobs respawning at an alarming rate and pathing that is remarkable in it's departure from the laws of physics.  I can understand the reasoning for having trash mobs, however I am not a fan of adding additional mobs to clear for the sole purpose of adding time to a raid.  Do these mobs offer anything else?  Perhaps there is something loot-wise that would make the tedium of clearing less painful?  Nope, unless you really are a fan of the new spell research.  How about experience?  Nope, raid experience is still way below what it should be.  These mobs and their accelerated spawn time appear to only serve the purpose of adding time to an already long raid.  <br><br>What can be done to make the Demi-Plane of Blood more entertaining without cheapening the overall encounter?  How about lengthen the respawn rates on mobs, alter the agro radius a slight bit to allow for the Player to use more than one strategy to get from Point A to Point B.  All we are left with is brute force and mass slaying of everything in our path.  There is no trickery, no sleight of hand, no flimflam, hocus-pocus or shenanigans.  You go forward, and kill it all.  If you get bogged down, you just added at least 30 minutes to your raid.  This, my friends, is not fun.<br><br>With all of the above taken into consideration, the Demi-Plane of Blood is not all bad.  The named encounters are fun by themselves, and fully challenging with little quirks that make things more interesting than "Heal Tank, don't sux"<br><br><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/ZTdead.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="" border="0" align=""></center><br><br>This guy is the first encounter in Demi-Plane, and the first time you see him it can be a bit surprising.  But in the end, he isn't as fearsome as one may have you believe.  His loots are very nice, however, as shown below...<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/Loot-armsofvamp.jpg" width="425" height="266" alt="" border="0" align=""><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/Loot-Leeringmask.jpg" width="452" height="308" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/Loot-Runicmaul.jpg" width="425" height="297" alt="" border="0" align=""><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/Loot-VambofFallen.jpg" width="467" height="242" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><br><br>We've also received the Monk and Rogue class items, however the screenshots I have are from before they were revised.  The rogue item is now a range, and the monk item is shoulders or back slot, I forget.  Here are the screenshots anyway...<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/Loot-StatuetteoftheTranquil.jpg" width="475" height="338" alt="" border="0" align=""><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/Loot-WovenShadowShroud.jpg" width="467" height="339" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><br><br>But we haven't been ignoring some of our old pals from the previous expansions.  Oh no, too many people still want to finish off the Vish Eye quest and our good friend Overlord Mata Muram still drops some neato goodies.  As an aside, I really want to know who has been poking Vishimtar the Fallen in one of his eyes to make it unusable in the quest.  Or does he only have one eye to begin with?<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/OMM-Dead2.jpg" width="1181" height="680" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><br><br>Yes, he's dead again, and he gave us some sweet loot too!<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/Loot-earringdragonkin.jpg" width="467" height="310" alt="" border="0" align=""><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/Loot-OMMChains.jpg" width="455" height="274" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><br><br>I should have more stuff to share soon....<br><br><br>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Quotes and Notes.........<br><br>Been a little slack on the screenshot key, so only have one paladin quote for you this time.<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/nov_05/WaeeMT1.jpg" width="657" height="53" alt="" border="0" align=""></div><br><br>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br><font size="5" face="Arial Black"><font color="#FF8000">Tele's Top Five:</font></font><br><br>1.
