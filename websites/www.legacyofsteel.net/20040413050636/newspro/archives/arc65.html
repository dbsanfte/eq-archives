We moved             through the Halls of Testicles with ease.&nbsp; We did not attempt             Dozekar, so I guess saying the Halls were cleared is a bit of bad             information.&nbsp; Drops were so-so.&nbsp; Of course all the named             drakes dropped quest shit that will only become relavent once             Dozekar the Cacksugger dies.&nbsp; Other drops included some plate             helms, gloves, chain gloves, silk gloves, leather boots, leather             gloves.&nbsp; Really not a lot of armor drops considering the number             of mobs that were killed, but o-fuggin-well.&nbsp; They're gonna be             raiding ToV again tomorrow night so perhaps they'll have better luck             with Legs and BP's.&nbsp; Unfortunately, yours truly won't be there.             . .but I should be back Saturday or Sunday with an Update.</P>            <P align=left>So anyway, we kill the first two Wurms in the Testicle             Halls, and we're killing the next mobs down below when my doorbell             rings.&nbsp; I'm thinking to myself, "I didn't order no chinese             food. . .don't answer that. . .nothing but trouble."&nbsp; Sure             enough, it's my next door neighbor standing there.&nbsp; "I need to             ask you a big favor," she pleads.&nbsp; "My rabbit. . .well, see my             husband is out of town and. . .there's blood. . .I need someone to             come look."&nbsp; At this point I'm thinking to myself, what the             fuck is this chick talking about.&nbsp; So I go over to her             apartment and sure enough there's this fucking rabbit hopping             around.&nbsp; "I need you to look at her or hold her while I check             her.&nbsp; I need to see if she's bleeding," she tells me.&nbsp; I             look at Bunny Fucking Foo Foo on the ground and tell her, "She looks             pretty much ok to me. . ." and head for the door.&nbsp; My neighbor             responds, " No Wait!&nbsp; That's not her.&nbsp; That's Floppy. .             .that's the male.&nbsp; Emma is outisde."&nbsp; So she drags me on             to the terrace and there is this black little ball of fur in a crate             and all over the floor is some ORANGE *stuff*.&nbsp; So she makes me             pick up this fucking bunny as she checks it for blood.&nbsp; The             whole time I am thinking, what a useless fucking pet. . .fucking             rabbits.&nbsp; I felt like saying, "Listen sweetheart, here's twenty             bucks. . .throw that fucking&nbsp;furry mess into the trash and go             buy yourself a new one."&nbsp; Well, it comes to down to this.&nbsp;             Apparently the orange *stuff* was not blood.&nbsp; Which is good and             bad news.&nbsp; Because the options you're left with when you got an             orange-stained bunny and it ain't bleeding aren't exactly             rosey.&nbsp; So I'm trying to get the hell out of there.&nbsp; I             mean, I was on a 20 minute AFK at that point. . .I wasn't dealing             with a life or death emergency, but some stupid fucking bunny.&nbsp;             Next thing I know, she hands me the phone.&nbsp; I'm talking to some             Vet.&nbsp; My neighbor wants me to give the exact description of the             scene in case she missed something.&nbsp; The whole scene was just             too weird. . .What does this have to do with EQ?&nbsp; Well             nothing.&nbsp; But next time you're pissed off at that guy in your             group for going AFK for 20 minutes, stop and think, "Maybe his             neighbor's bunny is bleeding to death. . ." or better yet, don't.</P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and             Unoriginal Bastards</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/badnamingfilter.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/sirran_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/tiggie.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/tigolesmommy.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Quote of the             Day</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_16/darvulia_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Turned on by my l33t use of Neb's Warbone, Darvulia             could not resist sending me *hot* cyber         tells.</P></font>
