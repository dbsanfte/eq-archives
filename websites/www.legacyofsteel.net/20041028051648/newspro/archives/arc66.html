Ok, WTF?&nbsp; The new             Draco seems like MORE of a Poosae than the old one.&nbsp; If you             wanna nerf something VI, nerf fuggin Draco.&nbsp; Make that mo faka             grow some testicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our clerics finished the fight             FM.&nbsp;

Wasn't that             the GODLY cloak all the warriors got over the last two weeks?&nbsp;             Did they do a retroactive nerf or are there a bunch of ub3r l33t             warriors running around with Blades of Tactics in one hand and their             Draco Mistoore Deal in the other?&nbsp; Hope they had the common             sense to not tweak the old shields.&nbsp; </P>            <P align=left>So we killed CT again.&nbsp; Was really fun.&nbsp; Not             a single LD so perhaps the server-side filtering does work.&nbsp;             Some reported the same lag but it could have been processor or video             card problems.&nbsp; Either way, we had no LD's.&nbsp; And that's             saying a lot because our CT strategy involves 120 people bind             rushing him over and over until he dies.&nbsp; It's l33t.&nbsp; I             read about it at the Safehouse.&nbsp; CT dropped that godly,             jaw-dropping neck/belt again and it went to             <STRONG>Cyni</STRONG>.&nbsp; He also dropped the cloak which             <STRONG>Galiaan</STRONG> now has.</P>            <P align=left>We finished Fear and some of us were bored.&nbsp;
