Who             ninja'd the goddamn sword?&nbsp; Hrm, oh well.&nbsp; Eventually the             sword will turn into a phat stack of peridots.&nbsp; Yay loot             tables.&nbsp; </P>            <P align=left>Well, I'd update with more info but I am doing my             laundry.&nbsp; Yes, it's 12:30 am at the moment&nbsp;and I'm doing             my laundry.&nbsp; See, I have to do it when I know I wont run into             any neighbors.&nbsp; The last conversation I had with a neighbor             from my building ended by me saying, "Fuck you you fat fucking             fuck."&nbsp; I kid you not.&nbsp; Now I realize, in the grand scheme             of insults, that was pretty damned weak but it's the best I could do             in my unchecked state of rage.&nbsp; Then this morning my water             turned off.&nbsp; My upstairs neighbors are redoing their             bathroom.&nbsp; This is the 4th time in 4 weeks they shut the water             off.&nbsp; So I pounded on the ceiling, "Turn on the water you             motherfuckers!"&nbsp; Did I mention the two neighbors upstairs are             70 years old.&nbsp; The husband had a stroke and can't even talk             anymore.&nbsp; Well, shit, it was early, I was soking wet, shampoo             in my hair, no goddamn water. . .I was pissed.&nbsp; So I             yelled.&nbsp; Anyway, a few hours later I walk into my office and             check the messages.&nbsp; The manager of my building&nbsp;had             left&nbsp;a message that there&nbsp;was some plumbing emergency and             he had to shut the water off.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; Sorry upstairs             neighbors.&nbsp; So now you can maybe understand why the only time I             can do my laundry is the wee hours of the night.&nbsp; Sucks too             because for the first time in the history of this collection of             freaks known as my apartment building a cute girl finally moved             in.&nbsp; Going to be hard to convince her what a sweet and charming             young man I am when I go around calling my other neighbors Fat             fucking fucks and Motherfuckers.&nbsp; What does this have to do             with Everquest or Legacy of Steel?&nbsp; Well. . .nothing             really.&nbsp; 7 minutes though left on the dryer. . .</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's, and             Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february/2_15/tigolejoebob.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quote of the             Day</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Polonious, our expert group-maker at every event. . .             .</P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february/2_15/polo_quote.jpg"             border=0>&nbsp;</P>            <P   align=center></font><a name="newsitem982137600,14391,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>From Oakland to Sac Town, The Bay Area and Back Down, Cali is Where They Get the Mack Down</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Wednesday, February 14, 2001&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>  <P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>Um, Ouch?</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february/2_14/dozekarattacks.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><STRONG>Dozekar the Cursed</STRONG>&nbsp;gets an             early dinner. . .LoS</P>            <P align=left>Hrm, well. . .more <STRONG>Temple of Veeshan</STRONG>             today, the Halls of Testicles.&nbsp; We moved through pretty well             tonight.&nbsp; Our first goal was another attempt at Dozekar (see             above).&nbsp; Unfortunately, the dragon came out alive and we ended             up very dead.&nbsp; Now, you're probably thinking Tig, wtf are you             posting about some dragon that kicked your ass?&nbsp; Truth is you             don't always win on first attempts.&nbsp; Sure we kicked Velketor's             ass on the first try, Zlandicar on the first attempt, Nexona. . .I'm             sure there were others.&nbsp; But folks, sometimes the shit hits the             fan.&nbsp; And in the Temple of Veeshan there's a whole lot of shit             and a whole lot of fans.&nbsp; Speaking of shit, let's talk about             loot.&nbsp; The best loot we got all night was 13pp.&nbsp; Not one             piece of armor dropped this time.&nbsp; First we cleared all the             mobs around Dozekar -- no drops.&nbsp; Then we went exploring. .             .killed all the way to the next named mobs in the testing             area.&nbsp; No drops.&nbsp; Some insanely buggy mob AI in the ToV             too.&nbsp; Mobs "charge" when low which I can best describe as             randomly warping around while summoning folks.&nbsp; Uber             lame.&nbsp; While ToV is refreshing from a challenge-seeker's             standpoint, the risk-vs.-reward aspect of the zone is pathetic.</P>            <P align=left>So the other news. . and I meant to take pics but I             slacked once again.&nbsp; We finished 3 epic quests on Monday             night.&nbsp; <STRONG>Cyni</STRONG> and <STRONG>Angome</STRONG> both             got their Ragebringers and <STRONG>Monq</STRONG> got his Celestial             Fists.&nbsp;
