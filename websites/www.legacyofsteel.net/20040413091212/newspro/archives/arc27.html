I felt as though my precious cack would diminish in size&nbsp;if I could not present to you all a photo of myself and the Big Bossman of the Temple.&nbsp; You have no idea how long it took me to get that picture taken.&nbsp; I had to camp through about 30 walls before I could finally sploit my way up to the big mo faka snake that's waiting patiently to be killed.&nbsp; Unfortunately or maybe fortunately (only time will tell) getting keys is a pain in the ass.&nbsp; So unless this bitch can be dropped by me and 3 others, well, he ain't dying on The Nameless soon.&nbsp; I shouldn't speak to fast.&nbsp; I think I might have found a nice pathing sploit in that lava.&nbsp; A little Muscle Lock IV, some high damage arrows and a whole lot of running and that bitch is mine.</P><P align=left>In other news, our webhost told us that by the end of the week our site was going to be deleted.&nbsp; So if suddenly you click on that bookmark and get ye ol' 404 error, well, you know what happened.&nbsp; Apparently, and I am sure some limpdick is going to correct me on this, our site, since January One legacyofsteel.net has gotten 18 **MILLION** hits.&nbsp; I guess this would all be fine and dandy if we had a web d00d who knew just what the fuck he is doing.&nbsp; But instead you get me.&nbsp; Because I left so many images on the front page, and up to a week of updates using lousy compression, we were moving 6 GIGS per **DAY** of traffic.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; Well, luckily we have some web pimps around here who gave me a swift kick in the nuts and got things straightened out.&nbsp; Barnabuss, infamous Dorf of Britannica, has come up with a new News Archiving system.&nbsp; Eventually all the old updates will be convereted to this.&nbsp; Barn also is responsible for the awesome Gallery section.&nbsp; Anyway, that's your warning for the night -- if suddenly los.net doesn't exist tomorrow -- just sit tight and chill until we find a host who can handle our traffic.</P><P align=left>So getting on to what's been dying. . .well mostly us.&nbsp; We've found some really cool shit and have been having fun coffining the guild all over Norrath.&nbsp; Like I am going to tell you what. . .HAW.&nbsp; I am loving the newfound breathing space that now exists.&nbsp; But yeah, we still kill some&nbsp;*cough*&nbsp;shit here and there so we can feel ub9r l33t and so that everyone in the EC tunnel knows we have 12 inch limp dicks when they inspect us.</P><P align=left>&nbsp;</P><P align=left>For example, we killed that OH SO HARD Thought Overfiend again!&nbsp;

I feel pretty good about it.&nbsp; We had never even seen the guy up before so it was our first time targetting him and pressing A.&nbsp; He got to half-dead before he killed us all in one masive, AE deathtouch.&nbsp; He was fun and we went in with almost no l33t insider info.&nbsp; Fucking Commisioner Gordon was slacking on the other end of the Batphone.&nbsp; Anyway, here's a picture of the dude who killed LoS tonight:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_21/shei_pic.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Ok, before I STFU, please remember that the site might tank soon.&nbsp;

I've been following all the threads with people posting about how *upgraded* the THO was.&nbsp; First of all, I see fools from my own server posting about him when I know for a FACT&nbsp;they haven't even been in the same zone as him since the patch.&nbsp; Yeah, he is soooooooo much harder now.&nbsp; What a massive upgraded he got.&nbsp; It's no wonder he went down harder than Team Finland and we had. . .um. . .0 deaths.&nbsp; But who's counting.&nbsp;

Simply an amazing patch.&nbsp; People try to credit (or blame) me for many of the changes.&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; I'll take credit or blame.&nbsp; But the truth is I think many of the changes that went live today were simply wise design choices.&nbsp; Sure, I am a vocal mo faka&nbsp;and am not afraid to speak my mind.&nbsp; I post my opinions here freely.&nbsp; But my opinions were based upon many hours of gameplay, discussions with my guildmates, and discussions on various messageboards.&nbsp; So while it was fun spending the day recieving tells such as these. . .</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/angry_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/vieopa+_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>. . the fact of the matter is I was not the only one who felt the end game had become a giant clusterfuck with predictable spawn times, wasted trigger mobs and the overall gimpification (I'll coin that phrase) of many mobs.&nbsp; What's funny is, that second quote I posted couldn't be further from the truth.&nbsp; Gone are the days of mass ToV farming by one guild.&nbsp; Gone are the days of time zone domination.&nbsp; If you have skills and determination you will be rewarded.&nbsp; If you worked hard and killed mobs first, you will be rewarded.&nbsp; If you were hoping for the free-loot festival to continue in places like ToV, well tough luck, homies, that's what you get for riding other's coat tails.</P><P align=left>Oh and hot damn -- the new AoW spawn trigger is simply brilliant.&nbsp; Thank god.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know what I am talking about, there is now a trigger mob for the AoW.&nbsp; And the best part is -- HE DROPS NO LOOT.&nbsp; There's no reason to kill him!!!&nbsp; We didn't want to compete with other guilds for the Statue.&nbsp; Now those guilds can go kill Vindi and Statue in peace.&nbsp; And we don't have to wake up and find out that yet another AoW was left sitting lonely in Kael for 45 minutes.&nbsp; Absolutely brilliant.&nbsp; THANK YOU VERANT.</P><P align=left>So speaking of AoW, we didn't know about the whole trigger spawn thing so we headed there as soon as the server was up.&nbsp; We teamed up with our homies, <A href="http://www.shockofswords.com/"><STRONG>Shock of Swords</STRONG></A>, and downed the AoW yet again.&nbsp; The loot was nice -- a ring for Rathji, legs for Siak and Kyntaro and the newly upgraded Blade of Carnage to Bzul and Falis (well one of those was from my bank account).&nbsp; Hahaha by the way, I read that some of you retards on other servers sold your BoC's for Peridot money.&nbsp; Rofl -- GG.</P><P align=left>Sorry if I am giddy as a girlscout.&nbsp; It's just that the future of EQ is looking very damned good right now.&nbsp; Some VERY nice changes that should make life at the higher levels much more pleasant for everyone -- unless of course you depended on your time zone or the ease of mobs to achieve success =P</P><P align=left>Ok, so here are some more NON-blown spawns of the week!!!</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/exiled_corpse.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><STRONG><EM>Exiled died twice -- yay</EM></STRONG></P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/glyph_dead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><STRONG><EM>Glyphed died and the newly named, Glyph died as well</EM></STRONG></P><P align=left>And by gosh by golly -- what dropped -- ENCHANTER ONLY and CLERIC ONLY loot (why does that ring a bell?):</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/hammerofsun_loot.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/memory_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Ok wait a second.&nbsp; The good thing is there is now new ENCHANTER and CLERIC only loot.&nbsp; The bad thing is it sucks -- horribly.&nbsp; Maybe next patch VI will upgrade these to something our enchanters and clerics would actually use.&nbsp; But a step in the right direction!</P><P align=left>We also got this thingy which is not so bad considering the FT fix:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/geomanticfocus_loot.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Anyway, I can't get the smile off my face.&nbsp; Feel free to flame me all you want.&nbsp; I really had nothing to do with this stuff, I just express my opinion.&nbsp; I've probably set the all time record for hate tells in the past 48 hours (yeah, we had some drama pre-patch).&nbsp; Sorry to all the moo moo farmers out there.&nbsp; Try Legends if you're still looking for the easy loots.</P><P align=left>Oh and one last thing, everyone just chill the fuck out over Vulak.&nbsp; I'm sure we'll see him or his too-good-for-the-game loot sometime again soon.</P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>FD of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/dada_fd.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the Day</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/metopious_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/february_02/2_14/reay_quote.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>&nbsp;</P>
