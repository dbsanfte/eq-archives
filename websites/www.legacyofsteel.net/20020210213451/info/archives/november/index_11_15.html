            <P align=left>Egads.&nbsp; I'ma take some heat for that one.&nbsp; 
            Price you pay, I guess, for cutting edge journalism.&nbsp; We all 
            know that you "females" running around calling everyone Hun and 
            Sweetie are a bunch of hairy bastards sitting around waiting for 
            G-String Divas to come on HBO because your too cheap or lazy or 
            embarrassed to buy some real porn anyway.&nbsp; God only knows why 
            you put on the Hun-Sweetie act. . .even more perplexing is why most 
            of us retards buy into it.&nbsp; Well, enough of this pontificating 
            about what is in fact the very seedy underbelly of HGS. . . .Let's 
            get to the update.</P>
            <P align=left><STRONG>Trakanon</STRONG>.&nbsp; Yes, the big green 
            monster is dead.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; The <STRONG>Protector</STRONG> 
            was especially bitchy tonight.&nbsp; Apparently, someone forgot it's 
            anniversary, left the seat up, mentioned the increased size of her 
            thighs. . .I dunno what it was. . .but damn she was stubborn.&nbsp; 
            But, when all was said and done, the lewtz was phat.&nbsp; Case in 
            point, check out the <STRONG>Golden Dorf, Signel 
Osmadi!</STRONG></P>

            <P align=left>As if decking the first Dorf on the&nbsp;Nameless 
            wasn't great enough, we also got to put the first troll in Cobalt,

            <P align=left><STRONG>Jumpalot</STRONG> dropped some different loot 
            for once as well.&nbsp; <STRONG>Monq</STRONG> was awarded the 
            <STRONG>Peacemaker</STRONG>.</P>
            <P align=left>There were some other highlights of the day.&nbsp; 
            <STRONG>Gandalfina</STRONG> put together a crew to take out 
            <STRONG>Vessel Drozlin</STRONG>, bringing her yet another step 
            closer to gaining her Staff of the Serpent.&nbsp; Also the Wizard 
            Best of the Best took place.&nbsp; All of our wizards made us proud, 
            <STRONG>Nyannyan</STRONG> going all the way to the finals,&nbsp;but 
            ultimately <STRONG>Sirc</STRONG> took the title.&nbsp; We wish it 
            would have been one of our own but we wish Sirc a hearty 
            Congratulations and best of luck representing the Nameless in the 
            finals.&nbsp; <STRONG>Tenaj</STRONG>, my main homeslice, would have 
            been a contender as well if he hadn't accidently nuked himself to 
            death.&nbsp; We love you, Naj, and thank you for possibly the best 
            comedic relief of the evening.&nbsp; I had a nice little chat with 
            Guide&nbsp;<STRONG>Velchior</STRONG> in Trak's lair about it. .

            <P align=left>I'm sure you feel a whole lot better now.</P>
            <P align=left>Well, today is supposedly the big patch we keep 
            hearing about.&nbsp; The same patch that's been delayed 3 times 
            already and then some.&nbsp; I probably should update the page once 
            the patch message is out. . .maybe I will.&nbsp; I really have no 
            comment on the patch at this point.&nbsp; It's more like, Batten 
            down the hatches and prepare for the worse!&nbsp; God only knows 
            what Verant's gonna cook up now. . .First thing I do when I log in 
            is check all my weapons and armor and pray.&nbsp; Good hunting 
            everyone!</P>
