No big corpses for             you to look at today.&nbsp; That doesn't mean we haven't been             busy.&nbsp; Spending more time in the Temple of Veeshan.&nbsp; Went             through the Halls of Testicles a couple times tonight.&nbsp; First             time we have seen the named drakes up in a week.&nbsp; Killed all             those poosae mo fakas again.&nbsp; But those quest items leave us             wondering, is this just Plane of Sky bank crap, Part II?&nbsp; We             really hope not.&nbsp; With the upcoming multi-quest nerf, our Halls             of Testing quest items could become the major, unlubed shaft of             century.&nbsp; Hoping to make that suck-ass, Dozekar, bite the dust             soon.&nbsp; I was really hoping we could try him tonight.&nbsp;             Unfortunately, as it always works, by the time we were ready to go             we had 26 in the zone, 4 of which were going LD on every pull.&nbsp;             We have a couple of strats up our sleeves for ol' Dozekar.&nbsp;             Can't wait to see what actually works.&nbsp; Of course, it's             profoundly disappointing that he does not deathtouch because we'd             love to send Desp in for that. . . </P>            <P align=left>So while we did not get many drops tonight, we did get             good drops.&nbsp; Two pairs of chain legs and a pair of plate             legs.&nbsp; Brionca was able to complete the Shadow Greaves             quest.&nbsp; Check 'em out:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_26/shadowgreaves.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>In other news, I am most proud to welcome our newest             member Rhap Shindigger.&nbsp; Hopefully Rhap wont get so drunk that             he forgets to loot his corpse before pulling.&nbsp; That was the             first sign of his l33t skills I ever witnessed, way-back-when in             South Karana.&nbsp;
