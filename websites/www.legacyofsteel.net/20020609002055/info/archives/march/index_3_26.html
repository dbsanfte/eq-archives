            <P></P>
            <P align=left>Today we have the non-update.&nbsp; No big corpses for 
            you to look at today.&nbsp; That doesn't mean we haven't been 
            busy.&nbsp; Spending more time in the Temple of Veeshan.&nbsp; Went 
            through the Halls of Testicles a couple times tonight.&nbsp; First 
            time we have seen the named drakes up in a week.&nbsp; Killed all 
            those poosae mo fakas again.&nbsp; But those quest items leave us 
            wondering, is this just Plane of Sky bank crap, Part II?&nbsp; We 
            really hope not.&nbsp; With the upcoming multi-quest nerf, our Halls 
            of Testing quest items could become the major, unlubed shaft of 
            century.&nbsp; Hoping to make that suck-ass, Dozekar, bite the dust 
            soon.&nbsp; I was really hoping we could try him tonight.&nbsp; 
            Unfortunately, as it always works, by the time we were ready to go 
            we had 26 in the zone, 4 of which were going LD on every pull.&nbsp; 
            We have a couple of strats up our sleeves for ol' Dozekar.&nbsp; 
            Can't wait to see what actually works.&nbsp; Of course, it's 
            profoundly disappointing that he does not deathtouch because we'd 
            love to send Desp in for that. . . </P>
            <P align=left>So while we did not get many drops tonight, we did get 
            good drops.&nbsp; Two pairs of chain legs and a pair of plate 
            legs.&nbsp; Brionca was able to complete the Shadow Greaves 
            quest.&nbsp; Check 'em out:</P>

            src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march/3_26/shadowgreaves.jpg" 
            border=0></P>
            <P align=left>In other news, I am most proud to welcome our newest 
            member Rhap Shindigger.&nbsp; Hopefully Rhap wont get so drunk that 
            he forgets to loot his corpse before pulling.&nbsp; That was the 
            first sign of his l33t skills I ever witnessed, way-back-when in 
            South Karana.&nbsp; I remember the cleric saying to me, "This was a 
            perfectly good group until you two hobbits showed up."</P>
            <P align=left>That's it for the quick non-update.&nbsp; More to come 
            soon.&nbsp; Because I feel bad for not including the usual stalkers, 
            freaks and quotes. . .I figured I'd give you all <A
