I had this update ready to go after a weekend of own, including the rarest of all EQ beasts, a Saturday night raid with mobs actually up at the ass end of an expansion.  But hey, you win some, you lose some, and we lost this one, baby - at least I finally got to experience what a Patch Day and random spawn timers must be like for those on euro/asian time when Ssra went down and came back up during primetime... it's magical... mobs are up, and they spawn at a nice leisurely pace so you don't have to complete with other guilds, when you kill one, decess and another pops - I bring my fellow Americans proof of things thought long extinct in our lands!<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_14/emp.jpg><br>Caption: Exclusive LoS Footage of thought-extinct Emp <i>(courtesy of LoS Gallery &copy; 2002)</i></center><p>Anyhow, let me preface this by saying I'm going to try and be civil about this one, but straight out, it's complete horseshit and VI needs to train its GM-Admin staff to understand the intent of its oh-so-holy content that we get shit on and suspended for by passing - I mean, if it's so fucking good, then why not make sure *everyone* gets to experience it, including the Game Mastahs... I wouldn't want anyone to miss <strong>content</strong> so compelling even zone dev's sploit their way past it, but I ain't one to gossip, so you ain't heard it from me~<p>For those not familiar with that abortion of a zone known as VT, it works on the principle of mindless clearing of 4 armed Akhevans, robes (which for some odd reason aren't undead) and your token black goo - he was bussed in from HS - to reach either a set of twin minibosses, the diabo triplets, boss mobs and then, finally, your money mob, Aten Ha Ra.  Again, a pair of two more black goos were thrown in - quota?  The boss mobs are tied to Akhevan Warders, non-targetable, unkillable mobs which are in place to force guilds to clear content in a specific order lest they be ported near kaas goo's hall of death door - bring your own tiny coffin to the party afterwards.<p>On the face of it, this is pretty gay, but don't worry, we're talking about VI here, and so of course it does get mucho mucho mas gay - the warders and their respective mobs are under no special compunction to spawn at the same time, meaning you could proceed in a perfectly legit fashion, and find yourself fucked at the end by killing a boss mob, only to have its warder pop at some point later - and there's nothing you can do about it, aside from petitioning for GM assistance to despawn that particular warder.  This is what's known as a bugged warder, and generally the GM will purge the late spawning, and hence unkillable, warder.  It can get tricky, however, as VT, layout-wise, is set in mirror, offering separate paths for a guild to <s>race</s> take, and so some warders are tied to two different mobs, killing either will die spawn the shared warder.  Clearly, in some circumstances a warder will pop before its boss mob - which brings us to the present.<p>The obvious solution to this circumstance is to wait for the parent boss mob to spawn - VT isn't very much fun to start out with, and you can imagine how enjoyable it is to stay huddled in an annex to what serves as VT's leveled narthexes, (not so) affectionately known as <strong>cubby</strong>, waiting on whacked random 6.5 day spawns.  But that's VI's idea of fun, that's the *intent*... that's *content*, and it must be done, in that order - or you get suspended.<p>Unless somehow you've found the cure to what ails you - today LoS was staging for a good chess match and race to Aten, with another guild which had by passed content to kill mini-Aten while TVK had yet to spawn.  This presented a problem as TVK's warder spawned ahead of time - this is not, nor has never been (until tonight), considered bugged, however the other guild was able to successfully petition and have a GM-Admin despawn the offending warder, giving them a clean shot at Aten, which they took, killing him... her... it... whatever.<p>On the surface of things, this sort of ignorance and aura of impropriety demonstrated by the Game Master Admin staff, the ones who should be most knowledgeable about the game, the intent, the Vision<sup>&trade;</sup> and to be considered above reproach, was vexing enough, but as LoS was also in the zone and with legitimate interest and stake  impacted by whatever actions the GM's took, or didn't take, it was outright offensive to be given the ultimatum to STFU or face a guild warning, moving us one step closer to being disbanded - even our officers were not allowed to communicate with the GM's in any form.  That, lovers, is unadulterated horseshit, and to be intimidated into silence, browbeaten and then left ignorant but GM's more intent upon on... I have no fucking idea what they were intent upon, because their actions make no fucking sense... than actual customer service was insulting.<p>EQ CSR is wretched - response time is measured in *days* and it's so fucking hard to get a GM now to even log on to the Nameless to answer petitions, I should probably be happy they bothered to even show up so I can see they still exist - how foolish am I to think the non-Legends scabs actually had a clue after a hard night of ignoring days old petitions requiring immediate assistance?<p>In truth, I get so fucking mad when I think about the utter gall it takes to shrug off players asking legit questions and pointing out immediate and direct conflicts between policy and action when the person committing the action is so clearly ignorant - yah, VI's got some good CSR people, but they have this annoy habit of running them off with internal politics so incestuous even the Brits would flinch.  Seriously - when players have to explain to the GM's how an encounter functions or, even better, how to interpret an item stat screen... or what Focus Effects are... or how tracking works... there is a major problem, and one I'm no longer interested in dealing with.  It's probably *too hard* to get the warders and bosses to spawn at once, I understand, but at least it was easy to cancel my PoP pre-order.  I like my guild and there are people I consider awesome friends, but VI - your fucking *game* as entertainment sucks ass.  I look forward to seeing the upcoming 48 Hours "investigation" as addiction is about the only thing you've got left retaining customers - trust me, it ain't content.<p>In closing, since we couldn't say anything in-game, let me say something - just me to you, VI, k?<p>Go fuck yourselves.<p>So from here among the groundlings, my only consolation out of this whole gannfest is that with your explicit promise to provide Premium Customer Service to the rich kids on Legends by fleecing them out of 4x the normal monthly fee is probably gonna land you in front of a rich kid's golf buddy, investigated by the FTC for fraud.<p>Love,<br>-Tork<p>PS: TVK spawned about an hour later - wuwu and ccc, we meet again.<p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p>How fitting, I check my mail after today's festival of gann, and booya - from the guy who brought you the controversial work <i>Gnome Sex Party in Pop</i>, I give you:<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_14/wipeout.jpg><br><i>picture uf ur latest raid</i></center><p><font size=4><strong>Quote of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_14/q-vene_quote.png><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body><a name="newsitem1034304346,96364,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Oh The Reflex, What A Game </strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, October 10, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork@legacyofsteel.net">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>Hard of the Core</strong></font></center><p>4AM is when most people should be sleeping and the unfortunate are waking, but with patch day random timers sequenced for European primetime, the Late Night division of the Evil Empire was in VT, doing some old school ganking to clear the place out - DXXT/TVK/DXVT/VXAHR/AHR all down and at times, it was reminiscence of old school PoF days with bold face, "5 more mins until boss!" and "1-2 more pulls!" lies when GoP threatened.  What amuses me most is that those lines still work. ;)<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/late-nite.jpg><br>TVK's POV</center><p>Late night raiding is actually my favorite time in EQ - the mood changes completely, done are the mundane afk's for dinner and concerns about due assignments or being up for work fade away to a resignation borne in the din of caffeine and addiction err... I mean determination.  The guild gels past that critical 1AM window, and we really start having fun, enjoying the sense of pushing ourselves beyond what's normally considered possible - or normal, healthy, sane, &c., plus the stalkers get all freaky with web cams (I shit thee not~).<p><font size=4><strong>Section Where Tork Bitches</strong></font><p>I assume by now most of you have heard or read <a href=http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=52118>VI's grand plan to fix shit</a> - if you haven't, then I suggest you take the time and do so now, it will affect you.<p>Where to start is difficult, but despite the obvious monk reaction, I understand why VI felt the need to do something - and I don't think the monk thing is going to be *that* bad, but yes, some monks are going to die under previously survivable circumstances. This sucks for pulling, and from a guild standpoint, sucks to lose excellent RT's - but I actually did find it silly a monk was preferable to a shadow knight/paladin (and at times, even warrior) for rampage. The real solution would have been to fix the bugged rampage list such that FD wasn't an issue, fix busted mitigation calculations and to increase sk/pal tanking - but that sounds suspiciously like common sense, and I'll move on.<p>That said, the other changes are completely gay - not a single redeeming quality. Many encounters will <i>(should)</i> need to be examined for possible tuning - and you just know with PoP right around the corner, VI can't give the proper amount of time and testing required... very disappointing, to say the least.<p>The manaburn nerf is not <a href=http://www.geocities.com/mana_burner/>wholly unexpected</a> however I completely disagree with the spirit of the nerf.  For many wizards, getting SCF and manaburn was a redemption from the kludged bane spell bandaids-over-bulletholes of the past, and really, what's so God-awful about 6 MB wizards ganking a few spawns, 3 expansions removed?  No one gets MB without a considerable time investment, and to make it truly effective, those same players all clearly worked hard to obtain excellent gear - please temper your anger with the facts: EQ is never going to have 32k hp uber mobs again.  Much of the public out cry was MB syndicates preventing players from obtaining bottlenecked epic components - that the argument now shifts from "I can't kill Vox at 53rd and Gore is impossible!" to "I have to pay 50k!" - essentially players complaining about going from *zero* chance to just camping OS a bit longer - is a touch ironic.  It is just a bit of sympathetic smokescreen diversion thrown up by VI - rather, I honestly believe VI latched on to the misconception MB was a means "for a group of wizards to destroy powerful creatures with zero risk" vice any concerns for the afflicted players.  Some of the best fights in EQ are the close ones, where having your wizards unload MB as TM mobs get loose, clerics run OOM and people are dying left and right, makes the difference - with an admitted <strong>miniumum</strong> 1 minute per shot cockblock, the stated intention of "a powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive short-term damage" is pretty much negated.<p>VI mentions more dynamic methods of healing with the new 7500 hp CH - that nerf by itself is no big deal, and truth be told, getting your best heal at L39 was kind of ccc and wuwu, but I am still forced to ask, as encounters are currently staged, why is it surprising players take the path of least resistance with MT+CH rotation, and if VI dislikes MT strats so much, why design every encounter for the past 2 expansions around such?  Even before AA's, with proximity aggro from Velk to Vulak and Rhag 1 to Aten, what was the intention if not MT?  Despite the addition of low resist mob AE's/DoT's, it still becomes advantageous to have a single character tank such that secondary healers shine - I can only assume the new CH lite was meant to shore up druids and shaman for just that reason in anticipation of PoP.<p>Even with all the changes coming, for any other approach to be preferable will require *drastically* different encounters and/or aggro model, and I don't mean simply more ring-type or hoards of TM'd mobs; after AC RoF and the burrower parasite, those aren't innovative, they are tedious and, frankly, annoying - sometimes I find myself wanting a Fast Fwd button or hoping the Ring will autoadjust to keep waves challenging.  Maybe the EQLive team is out of juice, so go talk to your network engineers - if they can load balance and packet shape for 40k-400k players each night, 8 dynamic worms for 50 people should be cake, but I digress.  And just like while you can vary the intermediaries in Quake from 1v1 to CTF, your basic MO remains to frag the other guy first, so as long as the measure of success in EQ is "repeating the same motions until the Large Thing you are facing,<i>(sic)</i> eventually falls down" - and I've seen the previews of PoP and heard the whispered leaks, there appear to be a goodly number of Large Things which to beat on, you'll forgive me if I have my doubts.<p>And now, the real homosexuality - the mod rod nerf.  It becomes difficult to wrap my mind around the sort of genius that thought making a single use, one minute recycle, target-to-summon nodrop change would be an improvement.  Just on the face of it, and even with target reply, how suck ass will it be for mages to have 2 banks of /target cleric_dd hotkeys?  Probably another VI misconception regarding manapools, but, again, without massive change, we're headed for either 25 cleric CH rotations or cue the gimp squad - your mobs and encounters have finally arrived.<p>The real insulting, or insidious, depending on how cynical you've become, aspect is that rods for personal use now represent a mana deficit, and given that mage mana regen was balanced with rods in mind, things are pretty grim.  What more can I say on the issue - shitting rods might have been as much bane as boon, but it was extraordinarily useful.  With such sweeping changes, VI <i>must</i> have thought this through - so they are aware we're just going to be shitting the crappy original mod rods because keeping the MT up is more important than a few resisted nukes, right?  GG on being able to use /pet attack again, though.<p>So what's old is new again - back to necro twitching, but that was oh-so-popular before, remember?<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/zed_quote.png><p>  A bit tangential, but it's worth mentioning:  why do necros get MGB if the only use is group DMF?  Kick that off in the bazaar, sure it's funny, but it's not 9 points funny.  If MGB worked with necro group taps then maybe it'd be worth getting, but even that's a stretch.<p>This brings us back, though, to the crux of bitching, in that after 3+ years VI is out of touch with its creation.  Two seconds of analysis on the above changes implies when a caster dies, that caster is *out* - maybe from a true roleplay perspective that'd make sense, but of course, for me to buy off on that, when you can die, camp, log out and come back the next day and still be on rampage... well, that would suggest a different sort of primacy to *fixes* better serves the game... oh wait, I feel the awful weight of common sense smacking me around again.<p><font size=4><strong>Return of Dada Artist!</strong></font><p><br><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/dada_1942.jpg></center><p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/s-bob_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/s-cri_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/s-cub_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/s-flute_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/s-mad_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/s-nay_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/s-rey_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/s-spell_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_10/s-wtf_quote.png><br><dd>WTF?

Today a member got a warning for exploiting a corpse in VT he'd made for a death run, but yet I am at a loss for words when the GM had the balls to issue the warning while standing next to this, corpses from another guild clearly set up for exactly the same sort of thing with which we're continually given grief,<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_07/wuwu.jpg></center><p>LoS is being harassed - with the player warnings, suspensions and ever present and, of course, nebulous threats of guild warnings or worse, it's getting old.  Not only are we in a constant cat and mouse game to keep legit CoH spots with in a rule set that no guide, GM or CSR Admin will explain, but GM's have gone so far as to not only move xp (unres'd) corpses, but delete them with no mention to the guild - imagine how happy we were to have another member's unlooted, fully equipped corpse purged - again, with no mention until after the fact.  I credit Kahil for going to bat for us to get the corpse restored, but purely based on circumstances, it seems even dying while naked is a bannable offense.  I don't want to start calling in the black helicopters, but the timing has also become... coincidental to be polite, with corpses mysteriously vanishing as we set up a CoH that which would put us into competition for spawns, yet... well, see above - events take place such that they have the maximum detrimental effect to the guild and, ultimately, guild morale as things wax petty.<p>If this is how it's going to be, then I want to see a statement from VI so we can rest assured policy is going to be applied across the board and it's not some rogue GM(s) with an axe to grind - because every time I see crap like corpses from another guild, both bugged and legit, scattered throughout VT with seeming impunity while we're getting jerked around, I can't help but get pissed off at this petty shit.<p>Love,<br>-Tork<p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_07/s-zed_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_07/s-kor_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_07/s-zed-1_quote.png><p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_07/q-raz_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_07/q-dos_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_07/q-voro_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_07/q-henric_quote.png><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body>
