            <P>Is it so bad that I have a life?&nbsp; Maybe I was in a lousy 
            mood because <STRONG>Hoshkar</STRONG> ripped through us like a sharp 
            knife through a wet paper bag.&nbsp; We're pretty psyched though, 
            we've been testing some things and we think he'll be ours soon 
            enough.&nbsp; But who's to say?</P>
            <P>So let's see. . .how did we spend our weekend?&nbsp; Friday was 
            spent in <STRONG>Veeshan's Peak</STRONG>, mostly exploring and 
            planning ahead for this week's trip.&nbsp; The zone can be amazingly 
            fun or amazingly tedious.&nbsp; The more knowledge we gain, the more 
            fun we tend to have.</P>
            <P>Did I mention Ninja Strike (tm)?&nbsp; For some reason 
            <STRONG>Venril</STRONG> was up. . . .we thought he was being killed 
            but I went and checked on him and there he was, floating around like 
            the big dumb leeezard he is.</P>

            <P align=left>He dropped a_shitty_staff_098 and 
            a_shitty_staff_099.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Congrats to the wasted 
            inventory space in my bank account since none of our members will 
            even equip their twinks with this garbage.</P>
            <P align=left>But there was some great news this weekend.&nbsp; 
            First off <STRONG>Daelomin</STRONG>, completed his Epic Quest for 
            the Enchanter Snake staff. . .of course it has a name but it's 
            fuggin late here and I don't have it.&nbsp; All you need to know is 
            that sexy pasty high elf, Daelomin, is now sporting two long snakes. 
            . .</P>

            <P align=left><STRONG>Ronald Johnson</STRONG>, inky extraordinaire, 
            also completed his epic quest.&nbsp; He now runs around with a Duck 
            on a Broomstick -- a necromancer's wet dream:</P>

            <P align=left>Many congratulations to both Daelomin and 
            Ronald.&nbsp; We all know how hard you worked your asses off for 
            those weaps and it's a great feeling for all of us to see you with 
            them now.</P>
            <P align=left>Now on to my MAJOR SCOOP.&nbsp; That's right. . . I 
            have a sneak preview for you all.&nbsp; Not many know this but I was 
            given advanced access to the new Everquest expansion, <STRONG>Ices 
            of Velious</STRONG>.&nbsp; Here for you now. . . risking 
            admonishment from<STRONG>Verant</STRONG> for releasing this picture 
            without permission. . . I bring to you an <STRONG>EXLCUSIVE</STRONG> 
            screenshot from Velious:</P>

            happiness.&nbsp; This next screenshot is for everyone who sent me 
            tells bugging me to update the site this weekend as I was <EM>trying
