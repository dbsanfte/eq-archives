The war is terrific fun.&nbsp; We had a ton of people show up to help us out and to them I am very grateful.&nbsp; Everyone in the zone was working as a team and it was a great feeling seeing things go so smoothly.&nbsp; Unfortunately, even though we *won* the war, Narandi got away.&nbsp; I had the mo faka agro'd, took his Harm Touch, but got just out of his agro range and he ran off to EW.&nbsp; Needless to say it was a VERY lame ending to what was shaping up to be an awesome night.&nbsp; Everyone was very let down.&nbsp; After all, we killed all the giants and Narandi was next on the list.&nbsp; It's not like we didn't engage Narandi either. . .oh well.</P><P align=left>Anyway, the true reason I like the Ring War is it gives me a chance to Roleplay, the true reason I play Everquest:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_1/ringwar_rp.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>In my continuing efforts to keep this webpage cutting edge, I am introducing yet another feature to the site.&nbsp;
