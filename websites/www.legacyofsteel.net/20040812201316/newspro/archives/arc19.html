I've been really proud of the way the guild perseveres through what have been some long and at times humbling loses while we're in the midst of transition and the attendant learning curve.  Blame it all on Trak, but despite killing that bitch non-stop for months in RoK, we got the shaft and shitloads of SK BPs that still molder in the bank.  LoS never had a Donal's Army - we had *1* BP in fact - and thus all the successes of the past are all the more impressive when you consider it was due to simply amazing clerics, not counting to 5 and mashing a hotkey.  I suppose we could warm up on CH rotation with AoW, but we're not much on going 11 months in reverse.  While the Emp isn't dead yet, the sorry sumbitch is close.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/emp_quote.gif"></center><p>Most guilds would call it a night at blood/emp/coffins... yah right - no GoP.  On general principles alone (well, okay - and greed), if it spawned in Ssra, we were all over it like a gnat on a dog's dick.  Here's what it looked like when we actually killed the stuff - watching it on SEQ from the zone line must get boring.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/al.jpg"></center><p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/hp.jpg"></center><p>Hahaha, this was where the comedy started - somehow mobs got loose and NO ONE got on the CH adds - HP went from <span style="background-color:darkred"><font color=white>Hi</font></span> to <span style="background-color:darkred"><font color=white>High Prie</font></span> as people just stood around waiting for phat loot to fall from the sky or whatever else they do when severe retardation sets in with all the get up and go of constipation.  With the cries of 'burn him down!' and 'MOTHERFUCKER!', we somehow pulled out a win, and then started to handle the mess - minus the people who stood around clicking on the corpse (on a personal note, IF YOU TYPE SLOW OR READ ON THE THIRD GRADE LEVEL GET OFF THE CORPSE.  K.  THX.) or were confused by the enigmatic 'kill the adds!!!!!'<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/hp2.jpg"></center><p>It all ended well though, and while I'm bitching now, at the time all I could do laugh (and cuss) at the spectacle of it all... cause.... you know, it was a textbook kill - you guys on SEQ, do exactly what we did - please.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/shroud_loot.jpg"></center><p>We got some new loot and followed up with the basement, but I forgot take pictures - here's the result, your usual dead snake with what looks like an extreme close up of a human vagina for the mouth... pussies.<p><center><img src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_24/dead-snake.jpg"></center><p>So much to rant about, and don't worry, you'll hear about it soon, but I'm off - logging in with res effects again, 1 blue left in 60 and rarin' to go.  I don't know where I'm goin' but I sure know where I've been.  Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday, an' I've made up my mind - I ain't wasting no more time.  But, here I go again...

You know, the same ones that said we were finished when Draed retired, or was it when Tenaj left?  Maybe Ariel?  Oh yah, now it's Tig.  Thankfully, that's just not how things work around here: HGS, yes - drama, oh God yes - but GoP, never.  After careful consideration and whatever else those elitist aholes do on the Officers' board, <strong>Henric Maelstrom</strong>, hero of the Halas bath house, has accepted the reigns and is now LoS's new GM, the boss, and the one you should send tells to complain about Jangos (and Korelor, and China, always fucking China, and... well you get the idea, Henric is going to be a busy man - but between you and me, don't fall for his 'fake AFK' trick).<p>Anyhow, days of limbo spent shard camping and killing pissant mobs awaiting the white smoke wax tedious and frustrating, but tonight as the first order of business, Henric set about feeding the Beast with the only thing imaginable: momentum.   After Andalier's stunning halftime speech, the Evil Empire tore out of the locker room and simply destroyed HP, the basement and Blood in the best executed kills to date - I'd say perfect, but Amulek mod rod'd himself to death... so actually, jeje, perfect.~ <p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/henric-hp.jpg"></center><p>Along with the usual stuff, we got some new caster pants out of the basement, but I sort of tuned out the details in my disappointment - let's all hope for yet more mediocre weapons next time and not junk up the loot tables with ancient spells or other useful drops.<p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/pants_loot.jpg"></center><p>No, the Emp isn't down quite yet, but the Evil Empire is back with a burning fire like when I pee and that smell of diesel fuel in the air isn't from one of Crazz's truck stop bathroom encounters, it's a big fucking steamroller - I hope Nameless enjoyed this small respite, but we want our 2 dollars.<p>In closing, we're all grateful for the tremendous amount of work Tigole put in to the guild, and while we can't give him the same farewell he honored Draed with,<p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/for-draed-vahn.jpg"></center><p>he's easy to please:<br><br><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/tig_quote.gif"><p>Some hang on to used to be, live their life looking behind.  All we have is here and now, all our lives out there to find; the road is long and there are mountains in my way, but we climb the stairs everyday.  Love lift us up where we belong - where the eagles fly on a mountain high.  Love lift us up where we belong, far from the world below, where the clear winds blow.  Time goes by, no time to cry, just you and I alone.<p><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/rey_quote.gif"><p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p>Oh, as if I don't get enough as it is?  If the tells I receive each night are any indication, I'm guessing Kinsey's off a good 50%.  Actually, I enjoy talking with you random people - some of the most memorable moments in the game have taken place in those late night sessions of EQ.  If Dave Attel needs a correspondent, let me know - though to be honest, it's closer to Fear and Loathing in Norrath after hours.  It's a tough call to keep this section as I run the risk of qualifying myself, but on the other hand, with the new *floating* GM's, the potential random acts of stupidity are pretty tempting.<p>Comments?<p><FONT size=4><STRONG>Quote of the Day</STRONG></FONT><p><img border=0 src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_20/anda_quote.gif"><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body><a name="newsitem1023667005,17666,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Waiting For Someone or Something To Show You The Way</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Sunday, June 9, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><html><head>	<title>Untitled</title></head><body><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4>                                                                                Our Fearful                                                                                Trip          Is Done</FONT></STRONG></P><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=4><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/momma_quote.gif" border=0></FONT></STRONG></P><P align=left>Yo yo yo freaks and lovers.&nbsp; So gathering from my *colorful* emails I gather some of you have missed reading the site?&nbsp; Shall we review some of the emails that have popped up in my inbox since the last update?&nbsp; Oh lets!</P><P align=left><STRONG>First, we have this gem which was simply titled, "Update Me":</STRONG></P><P align=left><EM>you fucking slut! it's been almost 15days since you last played with me! <br>update you sloot! hell websites don't have a way to talk to you in game so <br>we e-mail you!<br>now fucking update cause people need there fix, many like to jerk of to me <br>and your cramping mystyle!<br>you have 3days from this e-mail to update me or you can find a new website<br>kthnx<br><br>&lt;stalker wannabe but I don't fucking have eq cause luclin sucked and I sold <br>my account the got fucked over by paypal&gt;</EM><br></P><P align=left><STRONG>Next comes, "Tigole bro":</STRONG></P><P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2> <EM>need an update bro, i havent been able to laugh since i saw Triumph dog shit from Conan make fun of those nerds waiting and dressed up for star wars (no offense if ya were one of those ppl lol) .

The truth is you wont be seeing many more, if any, updates from me.&nbsp; I will do my best to sneak one in here or there when time permits but for all intents and purposes this may well be the last update I do here.&nbsp; No need to worry folks, I am currently working on the next update crew which will provide all of you freaks and social mifits plenty of good reading while at work, home or the computer room in Bellevue Hospital.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>For those of you who don't know, I hardly play Everquest anymore.&nbsp; When I switched jobs, my hours also changed, and the way things work now, I am never online during the *normal* raid hours of Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; In fact, I don't even have much time to log in any more regardless.&nbsp; I am lucky if I can log in at all.&nbsp; As a result I have also stepped down as leader of the guild.&nbsp; There are only a few people I'd wager in all of EQ who understand what it takes to run a guild like Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; Sure there is a plethora of guilds out there.&nbsp; But very few function and succeed at the level of Legacy of Steel.&nbsp; A guild like ours cannot succeed with a leader who is not online.&nbsp; I realize this.&nbsp; The last thing I wanted to do was run the guild into the ground by being a non-presence.&nbsp; So I stepped down to make room for new leadership so the guild could move forward without me.&nbsp; There are far too many talented, skilled mo fakas in LoS to force them to wait around till their slacker leader could log in.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>But don't get your hopes up, homies, I'm not quite quitting EQ just yet.&nbsp; I still have far too many friends on The Nameless to stop logging in.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Speaking of logging in, I hadn't been able to get online for a week and when I finally had a minute of free time I decided to play EQ.&nbsp; So I log onto the Nameless and found my character standing at the zone in to Ssra Temple.&nbsp; I say hi to everyone in guildchat. . they were off somewhere raiding.&nbsp; Two seconds later Pain and Suffering strikes me.&nbsp; I die instantly.&nbsp; Wow, cool, I think to myself.&nbsp; That's a neat new "feature". . .instant death to anyone who doesn't log in for over a week.&nbsp; I petition for a GM res since I died to NOTHING standing at the ZONE IN.&nbsp; While I am waiting for a GM to get back to me the guild gets engaged in some big Ragefire drama (you know that *fixed* spawn that no longer has any problems).&nbsp; After waiting for hours for no GM res, not even a response from a guide, I go to ME to camp the VT shard with Rhap.&nbsp; That was my *fun* night of EQ.&nbsp; Somehow it seemed almost poetic to me that the one night I was able to play in weeks was spent a) dying to NOTHING b) not getting any customer service c) Ragefire Drama d) VT shard camp.&nbsp; Fun, fun, fun.&nbsp; When will it ever stop!</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Now, I realize some of you are just bursting with curiosity, wondering how I've been spending my time since I am not putting much of it into EQ.&nbsp; Well, I work.&nbsp; Lots.&nbsp; I come home late at night and watch midnight World War II documentaires and listen to Pink Floyd.&nbsp; Then I sleep.&nbsp; Then I work more.&nbsp; Then I work some more.&nbsp; Then I log into EQ and die to nothing,&nbsp; Then work some more.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>But today I have off!&nbsp; So I decided to spend some quality time with all my friends here at legacyofsteel.net.&nbsp; After this I think I'll&nbsp;sit on the patio and listen to some Bob and drink a beer.&nbsp; That's how retired EQ heroes spend their time, right?&nbsp; Who knows, maybe I'll even log onto The Nameless and kill some shit later. . .</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Before I wrap this up I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who participated on our forums, sent me email and a special thanks to all the Stalkers.&nbsp; The Stalkers ranged from psychotic prison rapists, to closet comedians, to deranged lunatics and I loved every last one of them.&nbsp; I feel truly lucky that I was fortunate enough to get to speak with so many people from so many different servers.&nbsp; After all, what makes EQ great is the people -- the community.&nbsp; And I feel like I got to experience more of the community than anyone else who ever played this game.&nbsp; I hope you guys had as much fun as I did participating in this site.&nbsp; And don't worry, like I said earlier, I promise to deliver a crew who will continute the tradtion of legacyofsteel.net.&nbsp; Goddamn, I read other EQ websites and they are such hack, wanna-be's of this site it's pathetic.&nbsp; From my own server to servers I never knew existed, I see people ripping this site off and doing a lousy job of it.&nbsp; So fear not, faithful LoS readers, we will soon rescue you from the masses of wanna-be's out there.&nbsp; Shit, even my wanna-be's have wanna-be's. . .</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Lastly, I want to say a special thanks to everyone in the guild.&nbsp; I posted a message to everyone in our private forums but I just want to say publicly what a special group of people you are.&nbsp; You guys are truly the only reason I'll ever click that "connect" button again.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>So good luck everyone.&nbsp; Although you won't see much of me around anymore in EQ, you sure as hell&nbsp;haven't seen the last of Tigole Bitties.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT size=4><STRONG>The Wonderful World of Rhap</STRONG></FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/rhap_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/rhap_2_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/rhap_3_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><STRONG><FONT size=4>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</FONT></STRONG></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/britishloser_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/kikuinhead_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/obiwankenobi_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/ownedbyanoob_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/pisporstalker_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/liberace_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/prostitude_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/vladedivac_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>Nice of you to log in from the Golf Course to say hi, Vlade</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/wannajumptigole_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the Day</FONT></STRONG></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/crazz_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/cyni_quote.gif" border=0></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/june_02/6_9/parv_quote.gif" border=0></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align=center><A href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><IMG alt="" src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif" border=0></A></P></body></html>
