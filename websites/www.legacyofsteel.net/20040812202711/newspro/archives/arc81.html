In case you can't tell I've been finishing my Holiday             shopping.&nbsp; Didn't someone say this is supposed to be the season             of joy?&nbsp; Obviously whatever fool came up with that cockeyed             notion never made it to the mall in December.</P>            <P align=left>So Veeshan's Peak was on the schedule.&nbsp; We start             gathering on the roof, getting ready for some dragon             whoop-ass.&nbsp; Slowly it becomes clear that we're not going to             have enough people to make an effective run.&nbsp; Too many people             gone for the holidays.&nbsp; To&nbsp;combat some of the boredom and             dissapointment of a cancelled VP trip, we decided to whack that fool             dragon, Talendor, just because. . .</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/talendor.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>To give you an idea how low our numbers were, we only             had four people survive the fight.&nbsp; And two of them were             bards.&nbsp; (No, of course Tork didn't live -- who are you             kidding?).&nbsp; This is the part of the update where we all ooooooh             and aaaaaah at the loot.&nbsp; Only I sort of fugged up.&nbsp; I             died so I went to get some Chinese food while waiting on my             res.&nbsp; I'm sure we got something.&nbsp; And I'm sure it went to             someone very deserving. . .but that's about the most I can do for             ya.</P>            <P align=left>Well, before Veeshan's Peak I went with some people to             Dragon Necropolis.&nbsp; We were having a good time.&nbsp; Mostly we             were just trying to get some exp and the occasional decent             drop.&nbsp; We weren't after anything in particular, just fun.&nbsp;             Nizzarr picks up a named mob on track.&nbsp; So we head towards             it.&nbsp; Turns out the mob is holding what looks like a             Knuckleduster.&nbsp; Everyone immediately starts thinking             Willsapper.&nbsp; We decide to pull the rat, even though he conned             red to a 60, and see if we could keeeel he.&nbsp; He was a             poosae.&nbsp; Galiaan, a ranger mind you, was tanking.&nbsp; The mob             procs slow -- Willsapper!&nbsp; The mob is piercing --             Willsapper!&nbsp; The mob is at a sliver.&nbsp; Boom, he             gates.&nbsp; Next thing we know we are getting raped prison-style by             every rat in the dungeon.&nbsp; Anyone who has fought and been             whiped out in Necropolis knows what a project CR can be.&nbsp; CR             takes up right until our Veeshan's Peak trip.&nbsp; Big rush to get             there only to have it cancelled.</P>            <P align=left>After Talendor, I asked around to see who wanted to go             back and try to get to the rat-bastard rat.&nbsp; This time we take             two groups.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we had an accidental pull of the             mob with the Willsapper, got him way too early as we were             unprepared.&nbsp; We whoop him but once again get bent over by his             rodent buddies.&nbsp; I get ressed in-fight and hide.&nbsp; Polo             checks the loot and it's a Willsapper.&nbsp; All I can say is my             guildmates kick-ass.&nbsp; They went through hours of CR so I can             now proudly call this bad-boy my new weap:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/willsapper.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/tigwithwill.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left>Two groups took a major sacrifice for me and I wont             forget that.&nbsp; I like to think that's the reason behind our             success as a guild: Loyalty to one another and a spirit that never             quits.&nbsp; Well, that and tons of HGS.</P>            <P align=left>Another highlight of the Necropolis trip was our             encounter with Jaled Dar's Shade:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/jaleddar.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/jaleddar_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>I'll wake the sleeper with a phat knife to the             back.</P>            <P align=left>One last thing. . .got two of these nice cloaks for             all you AC sluts out there:</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/chetaribonecraftedshield.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG>Stalkers, Wanna-Be's and             Unoriginal Bastards of the Day:</STRONG></FONT></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/ogleit.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/ttiiggoollee.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Quotes of the             Day:</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/tork_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/polo_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/sengir1_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=left><IMG alt=""             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december/12_22/sengir2_quote.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P   align=center></font><a name="newsitem977385600,28973,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Been Dazed and Confused For So Long</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, December 21, 2000&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P>      <P align=left>Apologies for lack of an update today.&nbsp; My Vegas             run turned into a hangover which turned into the flu.&nbsp; Yay             me.&nbsp; I logged on for about 20 minutes last night, said hi to             the guild then passed out at 6:45pm.&nbsp; Gotta love getting 12             hours of sleep though.&nbsp; Felt like I was in college again.&nbsp;             From my brief time online I gathered enough to let you know that the             guild was doing <STRONG>Plane of Growth</STRONG> again.&nbsp; Sounds             like they got some nice items.&nbsp; I know Rogue Gloves, Rogue             Hat,&nbsp;Warrior Boots, two pairs of Enchanter Slippers, and a             Shadow Knight Bracer all dropped while I was there.&nbsp; Pretty             sure the guild killed Venril again on patch day.&nbsp; Apparently he             dropped something useless as usual or else I would have heard about             it.&nbsp; Ok, back to drinking juice and being miserable.&nbsp;             Hopefully I'll have a *real* update for my homies late tonight or             tomorrow.&nbsp; --Tig</P>            <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4>Advice of the             Day:</FONT></STRONG></P>            <P align=left>Don't try to drive a truck with 11 foot clearance into             a 7 foot tall parking garage.&nbsp;
