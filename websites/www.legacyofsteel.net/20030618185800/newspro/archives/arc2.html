Next time he's going to take it face down, just like all the other paladins in this game.  Much NOT GAY love and huggles to VI for finally getting random spawn timers to work - now fix Fleet of Foot, hot dammit.<p>As for Trolls - I, like everyone else, was playing around with the glyphs and runes, <a href=http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=5b4756eecdb7506833f1162046d323cf&threadid=9551>which the SK's are now speculating on</a>, and see another expansion is in the works for EQ.  I don't know what to say exactly - I actually really like the backdrop and the additional lore/implications to the original EQ continents owns, but at the same time I'm wary...<p>It's funny, as far as we've all come in EQ, the times I look back on best, admittedly with rose-coloreds in full effect, are when EQ was new - especially when Nameless had just opened up, and doing that low level stuff that everyone sort of scoffs at now, pleveling through to reach the questionable heights of the end game.  Don't get me wrong, doing PoP has been fun  (fuck SoL, I'm still bitter), but it's very different from the thrill of barely killing your first gnoll in the Karanas (God help you an undead one spawned) or one of my favs, those bugged DW gob pets in LR before it was fixed~  So anyhow, I'm wary because I want what's old to be new again, but I don't want them to screw it up - we'll see.<p>In closing, Merry Christman, Happy New Year and Happy Holidays to whatever you're celebrating this season from your friends in the big happy dysfunctional, drama-prone family known as Legacy of Steel.<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december_02/12_24/q-powah_quote.png></center><p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december_02/12_24/s-ari_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december_02/12_24/s-euro_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december_02/12_24/s-haka_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december_02/12_24/s-hot_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december_02/12_24/s-k_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december_02/12_24/s-ly_quote.png><br><dd>I love you, too, honey bunny!!

I looked at the calendar and was shocked to see Christmas is right around the corner, which owns - I love this time of year.  The only thing I can't really understand is why I'm getting cards from my church which read "Happy Holidays!"<P>Err... WTF?  Are we that sensitive?  I know some stores which have termination policies regarding saying Merry Christmas to customers (while, interestingly, it's okay to say something about Hanukah or Kwanza), but has PC gone so far that we're worried about offending people with a Christmas card to those who you *know* celebrate the holiday?  I can imagine some piece of shit telemarketer/mass mailer to pull a stunt like that, but how successful has Room 101 been that not one other person even picked up on the lack of Christmas in a Christmas card?  Double plus good cold day to you, too.<p>What the fuck is wrong with people these days?  You can't even say something nice about a 100 year old dude on his birthday without someone crawling down your ass with a vengeance.  Self censorship is one of the worst things a person can inflict on himself, but how much more awful when we're browbeaten into such a pitiful state under the insidiously creeping guise of protecting others' sensibilities.  I'm not advocating being an overt ass, such scandalous and insensitive words, wishing a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, are anyhow, but if a person bids me well during Ramadon or gives me a dradle, I'm not going to get offended.<p>Anyhow, you didn't check here just to hear me bitch and moan about RL, you came here for me to bitch and moan about EQ, to read about how <a href=http://www.lozit.com/remedy/website/roster.php>some officers in some guilds</a> leave ShowEQ bots FD in some zones, which subsequently log in unguilded twinks to blow spawns the minute they pop.  What owns is when the <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=224323>guilded</a> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=134065>characters</a> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=44088>blow</a> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=297753>spawns</a> an then <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7328>feign</a> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168336>ignorance</a> - which, believe me, I'd normally buy off on their stupidity, except, hot damn, I can go back and pick them out from HoHb that were once on <a href=http://www.remedy.fr.st/>their homepage</a>, but now have oddly replaced with unrepentant expressions of <a href=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december_02/12_14/frogknight.jpg>homosexuality</a> - it looks like a personal problem to me, but none the less, in between those bouts of Greek love, go fuck yourselves with those weak sauce lies that consitute a pattern of really gimp shit.<p>If a guild beats us to a spawn, and please - most have 8-10 hour head starts each day - and wins legit, I may not like it, but I'll respect it.  Killing stuff and keeping it dead is how the game works, and is intended to work, but don't think, however, just because you've repeatedly blown the HOH trials standing between LoS and Sol Ro with a Hail and no intention of actually doing the encounter that you're the better guild.<p>I've heard this and similar problems are increasingly common on other servers, and I sincerely hope VI is working on a fix post haste, and not the random spawn timer which is currently sorry mythical bullshit, because as I alluded to in past updates, this petty cockblocking is going to erupt into some major drama serverwide if it isn't resolved.<p>So, stuff dead and the Evil Empire munches... err marches right along~<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/december_02/12_14/saryrn.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/los-drama2.gif></center><p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p>Like I said, I'm back, but obviously I have no stalker tells - that whole not being able to log in thing has its downside.
