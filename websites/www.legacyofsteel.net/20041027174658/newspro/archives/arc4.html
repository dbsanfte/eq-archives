Actually this was a hell of an epic fight for us - it's exactly what EQ is supposed to be with its challenge, pressure cooker timer and a surprising lack of homosexuality.  Compare and contrast to PoAir, discuss specific instances in the space allotted below.  I really loved the fashion in which we pulled off a textbook LoS kill - undermanned and down to the wire, with <strong>7</strong> left standing as Coirnav finally went down in a beautiful 14 minutes and 56 seconds.  The only thing that sucked, really, was the loot,<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_29/l-mantle_loot.png> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_29/l-coral_loot.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_29/l-sphere_loot.png><br>Third Shield: check.<p></center><p>I can excuse all that shit tho - I got other things to bitch about.  Like Air.  Jesus Christ, it's not bad enough you actually have to do the Islands to spawns the Avatars to get up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower to find true love and true love's first kiss...  or something like that.<p>No, what's truly bad is that there's no way to tell if the God-awful rings are up.  Do you know how fucking debilitating it is to guild moral to do something like Sigi Island and end up getting fucked in the ass by some insulting yellow con ph trash?  Who, exactly, is going to farm those rings that it needs to be even on anything but a token respawn timer?  At least in Earth, for all its many (many, many, many) problems, the cacksucker who finished it was a decent enough human being to make the ring status knowable by something other than a 3rd party cheat program.  Seriously, <strong>fix that shit</strong> - there's simply no reason to waste everyone's time on poorly scripted encounters any more than is necessary to stall us until PoTime is finished.<p>Oh yah, speaking of that... everyone wants me to rant about the PoTime rumors we've been hearing, but the truth is I don't have enough information to go shooting off my mouth.  Instead, I'll just talk about the facts.  After some great discussions, what it boils down to is there's no reason to be first anymore - with each enforced choke point the gap between 1, 2 and everyone else narrows.  By way of history, in the past there have been significant advantages to going first, not only in terms of better gear collectively, but in that you're in competition with only the game itself.  In PoP, we're seeing guilds leapfrog former number leaders despite getting kills 1, 2 and even 3 months removed - repeatedly banging your head against the glass ceiling isn't motivational, believe me, and farming is something you come back to when nothing else is left to do.  Jaded is what the playerbase is like right now, and seemingly endless pieces of leather elemental armor (<strong>hint</strong>: 3 fucking classes use leather but it drops twice as much as plate that 5 classes share) hasn't been a good trade.<p><i>Cue Band</i><p>We're so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight, and we would especially like to welcome all the representatives of Illinois' law enforcement community who have chosen to join us here in the Palace Hotel Ballroom at this time.  We sincerely hope that you all enjoy the show. And please remember people, no matter who you are, and what you do to live, thrive and survive, there are still some things that make us all the same:<p>It hit me rather suddenly you see, we were killing Xegony a few days ago and I got up to get a drink of water, but as I was walking towards the kitchen I noticed my world had an uncertain gravity about it, a fluidity washed over my limbs reducing all sense of granularity in my movements as I blinked my eyes forcefully in an effort to reconstitute my balance from the odd eruption of misinformation my body was being feed from uncertain sources.  I slowly drew my glass of water and tried to drink but the smell of detergent residue gagged my now hyper-activated sense of smell, and a sense of general doom down south gave me pause.  I tried mightily to pull it together but my head felt as if where balanced on the head of a pin, teetering and tottering, precarious in its perch atop my now pallored frame.<p>Huntched over, my hands and arms in a reversed embrace to the wheel to keep me erect, I managed to keep it between the ditches and scurried into the ER dizzy as a coot and with a sudden urge to shit my brains out.  I'd just cleared the front desk triage station when the first wave hit, a powerful gastric revolt which jarred my body and unfortunately my bowels to motion.  I made a valiant leap towards the waiting room bathroom, but in vain as a wave of liquid shit audibly exploded in my pants, a stream of liquid hot magma perforating my pants leaving them spackled with debris.  In this shining moment of my life, I thought it only right to give a speech to all those present, 'FUCK. MOTHERFUUUUUUUUCK-' and then the seemingly innocuous fart given to me as a peace offering by my bowels to relieve my suffering turned Trojan on me, more shit and several Greeks spilling out uncontrollably in a froth of filth.<p>Needless to say, I quickly found myself in a hospital gown, shivering my ass off on one of those supposedly sterile hospital beds after being literally hosed off in the shower, an entirely separate tale for later.  Beyond the thin veil of linens, I could hear the whirl of the floor polisher and smiled a little in fecund pride, which was quickly dashed when I also heard the titter of the female nursing students as they walked by my bed accompanied by the resigned spectre of professionalism, a med student in his first rotation.  To his credit, he managed to break the news to me gently that while he hadn't intended upon checking for gastric bleeding when he reported for work, that was none the less the unenviable position we were now both in.  I say 'we', and I really mean three people - the doctor, me and my ass.  You see, there's really only one good way to check for gastric bleeding, and when the words roll over are accompanied with the snapping of latex examination gloves, quite simply, 'This will be a little uncomfortable.' is a bit lacking.<p>To add insult to injury (the order may be a bit confused, I admit), not only was something attempting to go in through the out door, but my guts had decided exactly now was a great time to deliver yet another strike package.  I was puckered all up, violently contracting to stave off shitting on myself again and here he was poking at the back door.  I was gripping the metal bed rails and my ass cheeks started to tremble, my knees broken into sweat and hearing Dr. Stangelove back there asking his assistant for more lubrication was not boding well in the least.  Amazingly I didn't pop like a pierced balloon as he began his exam, but I was squeezing so hard I think heard his knuckle pop as his defiling finger made it's wearly egress, but I think I could have done without such a chipper, 'Your prostate seems okay, too!'<p>I drifted off for a bit, but again was awoken in the night, this time to shit with a vengeance, but now I was confronted with a different set of problems.  You see, I was forced to use the ER bathroom.  I'm no germ freak, but Jesus Lord, I don't wanna know what was in there before me.  I threw down a quick coating of clearly protective toilet paper and dropped down, careful to swaddle my cack in my gown lest he accidently touch the rim.<p>All this was secondary to that last great insult to be visited upon me that night... have you ever tried to wipe your ass with the off hand?  I had an IV line in for fluids and had to rely on the other hand to clean up what even under the best of circumstances would have been a chore.  It really was the perfect ending to my adventures in food poisoning and yet more proof for "no good deed goes unpunished" as the offending agent turned out to be a cake I received as a thank you for helping someone out.  I'd love say something witty or pithy to sum this who experience up, but I'm just at a loss to explain how my life stays so interesting, it's like trying to explain to your co-worker why you have 4 hospital gowns covering the seats in your truck, somehow the truth, 'so I wouldn't shit on them' is a bit inadequate.<p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p>Sorry, I am so fucking tired, I'll have to update this tomorrow.<p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p>This, too./huggles Berton.<p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body><a name="newsitem1049695960,62391,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Blue Monday</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Sunday, April 6, 2003&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork@legacyofsteel.net">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>Sl00t and Friends Down!</strong></font></center><p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/x2.jpg><br>03/27/03 - yah, I suck<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/l-ring_loot.png> <img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/l-wand_loot.png><p></center><p>Again even!<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/x1.jpg><br>Good head, bad Gimblestan</center><p>I've been <a href=http://www.foxnews.com/>a bit distracted</a>, but thankfully LoS has been focused, mowing through the blessed content - of course, we're keeping up the fine traditions of the Evil Empire in PoAir, much to the chagrin and consternation of more than few GMs~<p>Actually, killing Babs was pretty fun - or I should say learning the encounter was lots of fun and then actually doing it was "eh" - the point of the encounter could have been made in half the duration.  I don't think I'm spoiling it too much when I say killing Xegony is only an after thought with this encounter, but while I applaud VI for trying to give us alternatives to straight up MT/CH rot fights, this one is waxes tedious and wanes fun very quickly.  And I say this as a melee - a bard even, one who is an active participant in the fight.  I sympathize with the rotation clerics, for whom this fight is akin to a VTesque 30-40 minutes worth of counting to 3 and pressing a hotkey.  Keep trying, VI - at least you're headed in the right direction.<p>If you're looking for a fight that's clearly *not* the way to go, it's PoEB Warlord - call it shaky aggro or mem blur, whatever, it's gay.  Memblur fights aren't fun or exciting, nor do they smack of innovation - more like desperation.  They are frustrating in the sense no matter how well you and your guild might play, if the random number generator comes up bad, you've lost.  Where's the incentive to be skillful?  Anyhow, we killed him,<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/warlord.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-war_quote.png><br>yay</center><p>and I am very proud of the perseverance it took to get here, let alone to down him, but I can't help but be disappointed knowing each subsequent fight is a crapshoot.<p>Ah now - Coirnav.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-raz-2_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-raz_quote.png><p>Now this is a honest to goodness fun fight (except it's in water - fucking annoying) which requires superb communication and coordination vice massive numbers and tons of clerics.  I love the short timer, and I'd actually prefer it were always the min duration, as it leaves you scrambling for an exciting 15 mins.  Forcing players to press themselves vice press their luck makes each phase of the script an accomplishment - the pace also fucks buffwhores.  Getting the right buffs quickly is important, but given ample time to obsess, too often players stray to the wrong side of preparedness by fixating on the minutiae, as if ac and hp alone will stand in the stead of skill in the larger sense of winning.  I can't tell you the number of times we've had despawn happen when many were paralyzed to inaction because 50 people required "just one more buff" to go.  Res Effects and Acid Jet - those are a real man's buffs.  Don't wear out ghetto ae or the fast timer, but more encounters that similarly test a guild would be good.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-raz-3_quote.png><p>Anyhow, I'm not a MT hater, I think it's got a place, and I'm not a designer so you won't get words like negative player competition and enforced group dynamics, but since it becomes impractical to do any thing aside from MT/CH rot for the boss type mobs, I'd ask VI to consider some of the other twists to encounters - a Trial of Lashing writ large, withering archer fire or that find the rabbit one who's name escapes me - sending out a team of ninjas to locate and kill a particular mob or accomplish a specific goal while the rest of the guild takes on swarm.  Oh - and no escort-the-gnome shit - I don't know about you, but if I were in a hurry and people were trying to kill me, I wouldn't be <strong>walking</strong> and I doubt it'd be lollygagging every 10 feet.  I might spout nonsensical gibberish with lots of typos, so kudos to VI for getting some of it right.<p><font size=4><strong>Outwar Cocksuckers Please Stop Posting To Our Board</strong></font><p>And that was asking nicely.<p>I think most boards get hit by miserably lackeys from this site every week or so with some deceptive, false or misleading post containing a tagged link to a site which borderlines on half a dozen counts of wirefraud (just my facetious opinion, I'm not a lawyer - tee hee).  What I've heard, 'heard,' mind you, is some admins are adding outwar and similar to their bad word filters, thus rendering any link posted as garbage.  I personally would encourage other admins to take a strict stance against scum like this - the occasional direct link I could care less about, but not epidemic and potentially disruptive spam at expense to my bandwidth and everyone else's time.<p><hr width=70%><p>A good deal of them are EQ players are in the military and I have gotten mail from a number of you who read this page - something I'm honored by - thanking me for the laugh.  To the contrary, I thank you, all of you, those servicemen and women who are in harm's way that I might wake up tomorrow in a world of unbridled possibility, one better than I left it when I went to sleep, safe in my bed.<p>Since the first murmurs of this country were borne in the hearts of Men, those hopelessly idealistic dreams have been cleft from a unyielding world by the terrible and awesome price of men and women who have died for principle; the very willingness of which such sacrifices have been stewarded, through the tumult of those would seek to suppress them, the voices of Man and the chorus of Men.<p>I mourn for those who have fallen, but I celebrate their lives by making mine one worth having died to live.  Take care of yourselves that you, too, will come back home to live yours - God bless.<p><hr width=70%><p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-frog_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-jej_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-sh_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-sme_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-zar_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/s-zau_quote.png><p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-aatrex_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-polo_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-quav_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-train_quote.png><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/april_03/04_07/q-vene_quote.png><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body><a name="newsitem1048029043,50572,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>Rattle Them Pots And Pans</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Tuesday, March 18, 2003&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork@legacyofsteel.net">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>U P D A T E</strong></font></center><p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/xeg.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-raz_quote.png></center><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>.<p>It's the word I hear 1000 times a day, usually appended with the word "asshole" or similar - and that's just from my guild.  A bit of explanation is in order, certainly.  To be clear, LoS isn't in decline, <p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-gmotd_quote.png></center><p>We're not movelogging, and no, the last time I checked, we hadn't been suspended or banned - but I'll check with Blixtev tomorrow and make sure.<p>No, the reason you've been greeted with a startling lack of updates was collateral damage, falling victim to my hubris, now punctured.<p>For those not familiar with running a popular website, it's not cheap - hosting fees, bandwidth, administration and registration all cost money, and that's before the human costs of providing the content.  LoS was very fortunate - Tigole and Draed have been huge sugerdaddies, but the time came for the members to step up and assume responsibility for what is a showcase of our accomplishments (and luckily for you, my penis stories).<p>So, as I tell the teeming stalkers, I was holding my guild hostage to kick in their fair share of the expenses.  It's simply not fair to those that did and do contribute so much to the guild to get further taken advantage of others who are content to ride on storied coat tails.  LoS might only be an EQ guild, but the people behind the characters are real, the time commitment, the trust and camaraderie are real - and so should be the respect.<p>No justice, no peace; no dues, no updates - this was a matter of principle beyond the simple, almost laughable, sum of individual money.  Principle - I am a slave of duty and my duty is only to clear.  I abhor your infamous calling; I shudder at the thought that I have ever been mixed up with it; but duty is before all - at any price I will do my duty.  At some point, however, I must admit even I became embarrassed with no updates, and plus that fucker Bender was getting way too much face time.  <p>So, now, for nothing more than personal enjoyment I will commence with the updates once more - I'm not asking anyone to agree with the choice I made - at best, I would hope you the readers and my guild would respect the motive and morals behind it.  It was never once about the money.  More than anything, thought, I am disappointed - not that this tactic failed to elicit any sense of similar duty amongst the slackers in the face of a waxing din, but of the base lack of respect it of which it speaks.  Your comments, concerns and questions are always welcome - tork@legacyofsteel.net or send me a tell in-game.<p><font size=4><strong>And Now For Something Completely Different</strong></font><p>So anyhow - LoS certainly has been busy as a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest, but I can't tell you the number of times we've all yelled, 'FUCK EARTH' in frustration - you name a way to fuck us in the ass and that zone's done it, without even the courtesy of a decent reach around.  The shit of it all is that the rings aren't difficult, they are simply long, tedious and buggy - I think some of the dev weren't paying attention during Game Design 101: Making The Game Fun.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-powah_quote.png><p>Even when a ring did reset properly, or a griefer wasn't setting off the Dust Devotees, or all the Triumvs actually spawned, the Arbiter was spawning under the world, or getting stuck in a wall or a GM was blowing us off when reporting these things.

I'll be optimistic and say we've only done him triple the number of times your average guild will - once you have your keys, piss on going back for that train wreck of an event if at all possible, and who can blame the guild and its officers - doing such a time intensive event for one piece of only "decent" loot is gay.  I'm not here to bitch about that, that's been stated many times - no... it's time for everyone's favorite section...<p><font size=4><strong>Tork Bitches About Bards (Again)</strong></font><p>Zaar, you knew it was coming, so why fight it, baby?<p>See, Peregrin Rockskull drops Drums of the Rathe - the first real percussion upgrade for bards since SoV, and no I don't want to settle for those BoT ones - it's upside down when an exp group can more easily obtain very high quality items than a raid guild... almost as upside down as killing the big dragon and then having to "get more experienced" from killing the pussy yard trash, but I digress.  Anyhow, as it (of course) turns out, the drums are not just rare, they are homogay rare - check across the servers and I'll be shocked if there are 10.  Total.  If the drums/Peregrin are wretchedly gay, then words are really lacking for the Rune Stamped Blade off Avatar of Dust, an encounter no guild in their right mind is going to be doing much if at all once they are keyed up for Xegony - and again, who can blame them, clearing up to spider island alone is a chore, and then the Sigi event itself is easily one of the most painful in PoP to date.  Oh yah, and <strong>then</strong> you go kill the Avatar of Dust for, you guessed it, another exceptionally rare piece of bard gear in a sea of shit.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-kyn_quote.png><p>Can do - I'm going to be positive and assume the devs just overlooked little things like that, and will work towards correcting them.  Part and parcel with that is the hope VI will remember to add in bard song mods to the high end PoTime gear - I've mentioned it before, but by way of example (again), although the Hydro mask is pure own, it's the Singing Mod that's really attractive for a bard.  What happens when a vastly superior all/all 225 hp/mana FT X mask drops - I'd sure love to upgrade to it, but I'm trapped again by the singing mod on the mask a la epic all over again... except now I'm not slaved to just the off hand, but to multiple inventory slots.  I still think giving us another set of AA's, 3 pts each, for the various song skills to bring the mod in line with the current expansion and then letting gear balance itself out normally for all players would be a much cleaner and clearer alternative solution.  As it is under the current state of affairs, you're always going to have either (1) special case bard gear or (2) instrument mods on all/all gear - both of which have huge potential for omission given past itemization.<p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/chry.jpg><br><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/march_03/03_18/q-chry_quote.png><p><font size=4><strong>Moo</strong></font><p>Jesus - I really have no idea what happened here.
