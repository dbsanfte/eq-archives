Despite downing everything else that was up, you can't spit shine a turd - we had some disastrous Emp attempts over the holiday break.  At first I was perplexed, we had the numbers but something washed over us... it was an oddly familar feeling, like a dream lost to the haze of waking but still yet couldn't be shaken away...<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_10/despair-poster-idiocy_quote.jpg></center><p>Anyhow, tonight was amazingly good and the Evil Empire was literaly 2 seconds from a win with fewer people than on any prior serious attempt - yah yah yah turns out I was full of shit last time I said "next time" but I really believe it now, and not just because <strong>I want our clerics to log in</strong>.  And yes, to all those who emailed me, yes, I did whine hardcore before, but I still maintain the crux of my argument - fuck ssra, I hate that place, win, lose or paw.<p>So here's your shot of a bard and 2 pets owning the Emp before I LD'd under the withering bit rate of broken server filters and AE bard songs plus god knows what else that's fucked up in SoL's data stream.  See, my cable went out (Charter - *shocked*) and I was using the old stand by, dial up, which again, as I get to thinking about it, pisses me the fuck off EQ now pretty much requires broadband for raids - I LIKE the little cheerful chatter of addiction as my modem handshakes and syncs up when I get home, ignoring food and friends to login and feed the beast, but I digress.<p><center><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_10/emp-50.jpg><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_10/emp-50_quote.jpg></center><p><font size=4><strong>Stalkers, Wanna-be's and Unoriginal Bastards</strong></font><p>I'm running late and as much as I want to wade through the screenshots to dig up Jeff K namefilter gems like "Uussuukc" and "Diicklipz", that will have to wait.<p><font size=4><strong>Quotes of the Day</strong></font><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_10/ado_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_10/barn_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_10/sl00t_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_10/parv_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_10/raz_quote.gif><p><img src=http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/july_02/7_10/ccc_quote.gif><p><p><center><a border=0 href="http://www.bizfu.com/eq_hosting.shtml"><img border=0 src="http://legacyofsteel.net/images/bizfuad.gif"></a></center></font></body><a name="newsitem1025802977,85915,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>It Was Intended to Be an Expression of the American Mind</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thursday, July 4, 2002&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tork_dropbox@yahoo.com">tork</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/torkicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><body bgcolor="#000026" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff33" vlink="#aaaa00"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#aaaaaa"><center><font size=4><strong>The Great Declaration</strong></font></center><p><dd>The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epocha in the history of America.  I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival.  It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.  It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward, forevermore.<p><dd>You will think me transported with enthusiasm, but I am not.  I am well aware of the toil, and blood, and treasure, that it will cost us to maintain this declaration, and support and defend these States.  Yet, through all the gloom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory.  I can see that the end is more than worth all the means, and that posterity will triumph in that day's transaction, even although we should rue it, which I trust in God we shall not.<p align=right>John Adams to his wife Abigail, 3 July 1776.</p><p><center><hr width=4%>†<hr width=4%></center><p>He might have been off a few days, but John Adams saw both the horrible cost and the great promise ahead for this, his nascent country.<p>Happy 4<sup>th</sup> of July.<p></font></body>
