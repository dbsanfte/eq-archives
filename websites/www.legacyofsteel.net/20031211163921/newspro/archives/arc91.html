Would LoS come and help?&nbsp; LoS             help to kill gods and dragons?&nbsp; Don't have to ask twice.&nbsp;             We hastily threw together two groups to join forces with the gang             already in Hate.&nbsp;

Our numbers in Hate             were more than sufficient but we lacked certain classes.&nbsp; For             example, there was no one who could land slow.&nbsp; To make a long             story short, he FoWned us.&nbsp; Hard.&nbsp; Twice.&nbsp; Many             wanted to log.&nbsp; Many did.&nbsp; Never ones to quit though, we             managed to rally support to try one final attempt.&nbsp; Finally,             with one last spirited effort we took the Superman Vampire down once             and for all.</P>            <P align=center><IMG alt="Maestro going down"             src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november/11_7/maestro.jpg"             border=0></P>            <P align=center>Many thanks to <STRONG>Globin</STRONG> of             <STRONG>Crimson Tempest</STRONG> for inviting us up to help.</P>            <P align=center>&nbsp;</P>            <P align=center>&nbsp;</P>            <P   align=center></font><a name="newsitem973497600,64998,"></a><P align=left><HR><STRONG>GORENAIRE: We Came, We Saw, We Got Ressed</strong>&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Monday, November 6, 2000&nbsp;-- &nbsp;<a href="mailto:tigole@legacyofsteel.net">tigole</a> <img src = "http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/tigoleicon.jpg" border=0><HR></P><CENTER><STRONG>"Was             it over when the German's Bombed Pearl Harbor?" -- John Belushi,             Animal House</STRONG><CENTER><P><br><FONT color=#aaaaaa>Some guilds             might be super secretive about their Dragon-slaying             strategies.&nbsp;
