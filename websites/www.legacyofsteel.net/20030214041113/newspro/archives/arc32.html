We weren't alone though.&nbsp; Our European friends decided to wax some leezurds as well.&nbsp; At one point we even had a little "race" to see who would get to Koi Poosae first.&nbsp; Personally, I don't enjoy any competition in this game against something I cannot lay my spear and dagger into however if someone issues LoS a challenge, well, let's just say this bull has some very large horns.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_9/zzijah.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Koi dropped a net, a bracer and a dagger.</P><P align=left>Oh speaking of Koi, the night before we had a truly classic Koi encounter.&nbsp;

It's always fun prepping for the Ring War.&nbsp; You get to deal with the 30 or so people who hang out in Great Divide doing experience who hate your guts because you start the Ring War every week.&nbsp; Here's this week's Quote of the Ring War:</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_9/legorian_ringwar.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>In any event, we had far fewer people than for our previous war yet we still prevailed.&nbsp; Many thanks go out to all the people who were in GD and rather than complain, picked up their weapons and joined the battle.&nbsp; I've said it before and I will say it again, the Ring War is one of the funnest encounters in the game.&nbsp; And to top it all off, I got my 10th Ring of Dain Cacksugger!!</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" src="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/november_01/11_9/narandihead.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Once again it's time for a new feature.&nbsp;

Upon trying to log back in I receive the, "This Zone Unavailable" message.&nbsp; Uh oh,&nbsp;I think.&nbsp; This cannot be good.&nbsp; Sure enough, I finally log back in and get raped by Lady Miranella and her two pets.&nbsp; How odd. . .I could remember killing Lady Miranella just a few hours before. . .Of course it's in my log files, we even have the loot fresh off her corpse.&nbsp; As is the Vyemm kill.&nbsp; ALL the other dragons but Vulak were dead.</P><P align=left>Well, sure things seem shitty at that point right?&nbsp; But of course there is a GM staff to handle such problems.&nbsp; Easy enough right?&nbsp; But WAIT!! That would involve a GM actually being present on The Nameless.&nbsp; Well, after about 30 minutes of bitching in chat we finally get a GM to show up.&nbsp; How is Verant's FINE customer service going to fix this problem?&nbsp; They decide we're all entitled to a GM res at the zone in!!!!&nbsp; How fucking SWEET of them.&nbsp; We have 2 hours before another patch (way to fucking go QUALITY ASSURANCE DEPARTMENT on that awesome test of the Patch!!!! Wow lasted a whole, what, 9 hours?).&nbsp; So we're fucked.&nbsp; We're supposed to re-kill the entire North Wing Spawn for the Vulak loot we had just worked all that time to get?&nbsp; Un-fucking-believable.</P><P align=left>Am I pissed that 3 items of Vyemm loot (good fucking loot for once too)&nbsp;poofed with the&nbsp;rest of the zone?&nbsp; Hell yes.&nbsp; Am I pissed that we were 10 minutes from killing Vulak and instead of getting 3 GODLY items we all got GM resses?&nbsp; Fuck yes.&nbsp; Am I pissed that I got kicked out of chat for asking for a GM to show up in the first place?
