Those wishing to join The Dragonslayers must not have characters in any other guild. You must be at least level 15 to apply to our family. We are on The Rathe server. We do not allow dual memberships in other guilds.  We *do* accept members from other guilds as long as that member left on honorable terms, and has dissolved their membership in said guild. 
<p>
We do at this time allow a member to have two ( 2 ) and in special cases up to four (4) characters in the guild simultaneously. The main character will be listed with photo and the alternate characters listed underneath.  Only your main character will have a chance for a Royal House or Royal Court position, but alts can apply to the Elite Guard or for Royal Staff positions. Specific member rules are found on the member pages. You must read and follow those rules.
<p>

Full Members that are absent from the guild for more than one month without notifying the leaders will be listed as inactive. If not heard from by the end of one inactive month, the member will be taken off the guild roster. Probationary members are not to be gone from /guildsay longer than a week without writing their Lord/Lady and this must be for extenuating circumstances. If you just got invited to our guild and then don't come around, you must not want to be here.

Whether it be suggestions or problems, you must follow the Chain of Command for your main character. Members of the Royal Staff contact the Crown Princess first. If she is not avail, they go to the Crown Prince or Princess of Court.  Members of the Elite Guard will go to the Captain of the Guard. If the problem is with the Captain, the EG member will seek out the Queen. Full and Probationary members look first to the Lord or Lady of their racial homeland (see members section for specifics). If the Lord or Lady of the member's homeland is not available, then go to another Lord or Lady. If the problem is with the Lord or Lady then go to the Princess of Court, preferrably through email. If Princess of Court is not available look to the Crown Princess.
<p>
This is a Guild of Honor, Nobility, and Friendship.  We expect all members to act accordingly.  We do not allow kill stealing, or slanderous words and actions on the part of our members.   Any member that brings any shame to our name or our members will have a full hearing of the Royal House and Royal Court and dealt with accordingly. <p>

When a member is accused of a wrong doing, certain actions will take place before a punishment is handed down from the RH/RC (Council).
<p><blockquote>
1.There will be 2 officers assigned to investigate the situation. After the completion of the investigation they will report their findings to the Council. At that time it will be decided when a hearing among the members' peers will take place.
  <p>
           2.  The member will be notified of a time and date that a formal hearing in chat session will take place.  This hearing will be conducted by the Council and witnessed by regular members that wish to attend.  The member may also bring in people for his own defense.  
  <p>
         3.  After the hearing the Council will hand down a verdict and a sentence if necessary.  Sentence will depend on the severity of the crime.</blockquote>
