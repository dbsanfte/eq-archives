<FONT SIZE=+1>

1. Your character must be level 15 or higher to apply.
<p>
2.You must read the webpages, understand them, and follow all rules for The Dragonslayers.  If you cannot go through the pages and know who the officers are, what their duties are; if you cannot read and remember the Elite Guard or Chain of Command, then please do not waste our time and yours. <p>

3. Remember that this is a Matriarchal Monarchy, not a democracy. Our Queen Toythunder is the final and highest member, and answers to none except herself. If you cannot abide by her decisions, this is not the guild for you. Would-be Kings need not apply.<p>

4. You must have had at least one group hunt with at least one member of the Royal House or Royal Court, and met and hunted with 3-4 full members of the guild. This helps us get to know you a little better and you get to know us some too. Email the Lord/Lady of your land once you have completed this step with the names of who you have gotten to know.<p>

5.Once invited into the guild you will be on 30 day probation, at the satisfactory completion of the probationary time if we feel you fit our family you will be formally inducted.  Inductions are held once a month. Not all that ask get an invite, and not all invited become full members. <p>

6. Any member may send in suggestions at any time, but must use the Chain of Command. Email to your Lord or Lady is appreciated, preferred, and always appropriate. If it concerns an immediate online problem (that cannot wait for email) seek out  your homeland Lord or Lady first. If he/she is not available seek out another Lord or Lady.   If the problem is with them, then seek out the Princes and Princesses.<p>
7. Must be at least 16 years of age to join The Dragonslayers Guild.<p>
8. Even though we are a guild of Honor and Helping, we seek to help those most who help themselves. Do not expect hand-outs. Do not beg higher levels to get items or armor for you. Most appreciate and welcome the opportunity to go with you to hunt in an area for an item. You should help other guild members where and when you can, especially corpse retrievals. <p>
9. Rudeness/bad language will not be tolerated on guildsay or to another guild member. If conversation must be persued take it to /tell's..to bring such words before all on channel is not the action of an honorable person.  Be nice and polite. Please try to greet all people on channel. If you can answer a question for someone please do so.<p>
10. We believe strongly that the guild must suit the person and the person suit the guild.  Members who find themselves incurably unhappy or with interests elsewhere are welcome to notify a leader and then type /guildremove [name of member] to leave the Dragonslayers.<p>
These rules are for helping each other to see that we can all have fun.<p>&nbsp;<p>
Fill out an <a href="http://2amstudios.com/ds/dsjoin.html">Application Form</a>. The Lord or Lady of your racial homeland will email you.<p>
