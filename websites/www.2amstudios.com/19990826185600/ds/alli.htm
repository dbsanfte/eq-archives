<font size=4>Friendship/Peaceful Alliance.<p>
All Dragonslayers are to treat members of the Dragon Dynasty like they would their own guildmates. This includes coming to their aid, hunting, and general courtesies. <p>

Dragonslayers and Dragon Dynasty met June 12 in Kithicor to formalize their alliance. Queen Toythunder of the Dragonslayers and Emperor Lashz of Dragon Dynasty as well as members from each guild were in attendance.  Emperor Lashz presented gifts to members of the Dragonslayers that came to the aid of Dragon Dyansty, helping them retrieve member corpses from Befallen. </center>

<font size=4>Friendship Alliance<p></font>
A Friendship Alliance is where both guilds are on friendly terms, and hold guild activities together.<p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>
<font size=4>Peaceful (non-aggressive) Alliance<p></font>
A Peaceful Alliance is where both guilds are on at least neutral terms, and will remain neutral, even when a guild that they are allied with goes to war against a guild that they have a peaceful alliance with.<p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>
<font size=4>Full Alliance<p></font>
A Full Alliance is where both guilds are on friendly terms, and would come to the aid of their ally in times of war. The exception to this is when a guild that we have a Full Alliance with goes to war against a guild that we have a peacefull alliance with.  At that point, we would remain out of the fighting, but would offer any aid that was possible.
