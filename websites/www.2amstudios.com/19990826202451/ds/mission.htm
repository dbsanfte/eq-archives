                           First Age: Darkness and Dragons</center><p>

It is said that thousands of years ago the world known as Norrath was "noticed" by Veeshan, the great Crystalline Dragon who rules the Plane of Sky. Pleased with the conditions on Norrath , Veeshan deposited her brood onto the frozen continent of Velious. Then, with one swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened several great wounds on the surface of Norrath, thus staking her claim to this promising new world. 
<p>
The Duke of Below called a meeting of the Gods.  Each agreed to populate the world with races to keep the Wurmqueen in check. Within each race, champions were chosen to take the battle to the brood of Veeshan. These champions were named "Dragonslayers"; fiercely devoted to their cause and to each other. The battle has been fought for thousands of years now, with each side gaining minor victories over the other, but the war rages on. With every generation a handful of new Dragonslayers are born, individuals who know what destiny has laid out for them to do, and willingly accept the honor of defending Norrath against the Brood of Veeshan.
<p>
The Dragonslayers are a guild of Honor, Friendship, and Family. We strive to help the people of Norrath when ever possible, and to defend it from the Brood of the Veeshan. Our Code of Honor prohibits stealing from players and murder, as these are not the actions of an honorable person, and we will only enter into combat with other adventurers in defense of the Guild or one of it's members, in duels of honor, or in times of war.
<p>
 Our guild resides on the Rathe server
