<br>
I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I had forgotten to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered, saying,&quot; Hello&quot;.<br>
<br>
I politely said, &quot;This is Fred Hanifin. Could I please speak with <br>
Robin Carter?&quot; Suddenly, the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. <br>
<br>
I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. I had <br>
transposed the last two digits of her phone number. After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again.<br>
<br>
When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, &quot;You're an asshole!&quot; and hung up. I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, and put it in my desk drawer.<br>
<br>
Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell, &quot;You're an asshole!&quot; It always cheered me up.<br>
<br>
When Caller ID came to our area, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, &quot;Hi, this is John Smith from the Telephone Company. I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with the Caller ID program?&quot; He yelled, &quot;NO!&quot; and slammed the phone down. I quickly called him back and said, &quot;That's because you're an asshole!&quot;<br>
<br>
One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I had been waiting for the spot. The idiot ignored me. I noticed a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign in his car window - so, I wrote down his number.<br>
<br>
A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole, (I <br>
had his number on speed dial), I thought I had better call the BMW asshole, too. I said, &quot;Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, it is.&quot; &quot;Can you tell me where I can see it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. I live at 1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house, and the car's parked right out in front.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What's your name?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Don Hansen,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;When's a good time to catch you, Don?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm home every evening after five.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen, Don, can I tell you something?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don, you're an asshole.&quot; Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too. Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. But after several months of calling them, it wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be.<br>
<br>
So, I came up with an idea. I called Asshole #1.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're an asshole!&quot; (But I didn't hang up).<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you still there?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop calling me,&quot; he screamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Make me,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Don Hansen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah? Where do you live?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Asshole, I live at 1802 West 34th Street, a yellow house, with my black Beemer parked in front.&quot;<br>
<br>
He said, &quot;I'm coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers.&quot;<br>
<br>
I said, &quot;Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then I called Asshole #2. &quot;Hello?&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello, asshole,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
He yelled, &quot;If I ever find out who you are?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll what?&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll kick your ass,&quot; he exclaimed.<br>
<br>
I answered, &quot;Well, asshole, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I lived at 1802 West 34th Street, and that I was on my way over there to kill my gay lover.<br>
<br>
Then I called Channel 13 News about the gang war going down on West 34th Street.<br>
<br>
I quickly got into my car and headed over to 34th Street. There I saw two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six squad cars, a police helicopter, and news crew.<br>
<br>
NOW I feel better!<br>
