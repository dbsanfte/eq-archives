<br>
Altus Domini (AD) is a raiding guild.  The reason we exist is to raid.   Having said that we actively encourage all members to group with Guild members, Alliance members, and affiliates wherever and whenever possible.  Leadership of Altus Domini<br>
encourages members to group, but we do not and will not FIND you a group.  Our guild and alliance chat /Colorado provides you the means to find groups within our family.<br>
<br>
Altus Domini actively encourages the practice known as &quot;boxing&quot; or running more than one active account at a time.  So much so that each account has one main that you<br>
will need to declare.  Each main has individual loot privileges and is treated as a unique member of our family when loot time comes.<br>
<br>
Altus Domini started as a close-knit group of friends who all knew each other in real life.  That general theme continues to this day.  Our family is simply growing.  When you become a member of Altus Domini you become a member of the AD Family. Within our family you will find folks to talk with, tease, and cherish.  Like any family you will also find that 2nd cousin you can't stand.  But we are family and everyone in AD is precious to us.<br>
<br>
Raids will be posted on our guild message board.  If you are online during raid time and are of appropriate level for that raid we do expect you to be there unless there are circumstances that prevent you arriving or staying for the raid.  Just let us know please.<br>
<br>
Please BE ON TIME for raids whenever possible.  We try to setup CoH lines and alternate pickups whenever we raid for those that cannot arrive in a timely fashion due to RL commitments.  Your assistance in this is invaluable.<br>
<br>
LISTEN AND PAY ATTENTION to Raid leaders.  Leading the raids requires a great deal of effort and concentration.  Particularly when you realize your leaders are running<br>
more than one character.  During raids please do NOT send the raid leaders general chat tells.  Pay attention to instructions, if you need buffs let your group leader<br>
know.  As we progress up this will become more and more important.<br>
<br>
Altus Domini is a family guild but we are not children.  AD does not require you to not curse when you are mad, complain in colorful terms about this or that or restrict your language too much.  What we do require is that cursing may ONLY be<br>
done within guild or alliance chat.  Do NOT flame someone in /OOC or /SHOUT.  There WILL be times you want to, that is the nature of the game.  But your actions outside of our channel reflect only negatively on our organization as a whole.  Within our channel, there are a few limitations.  Speech with derogatory comments about real life Race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or direct personal harassment will not be tolerated at anytime by anyone.  It is perfectly ok to call Amadeuus a stuck up, gay gnome mage with delusions of being tall enough to be a soccer ball.  It is quite a different matter to say similar things to the player himself.  As we come from all races, walks of life, religious and social backgrounds things offensive to one are not to others.  A general guideline, if chat becomes offensive to someone and they ask you to stop..STOP.  It really is that simple.<br>
<br>
The use of /Roleplay is allowed within Altus Domini.  The use of /Anon is not permitted.<br>
<br>
Loots within Altus Domini are decided on a need before greed basis.  In general, AD uses a loot council of 3 members on each raid to assign loots to the appropriate people.  In most cases, when a loot is announced all attending members of that raid that are interested in that loot will send a /tell to the leader of the loot council.  This must be done quickly after announcement as a lot of the loots we are after are no drop and will rot.  The loot council then decides between the members who are interested in it.  The decision on who gets is strictly a value decision based on who needs the most, how often you raid with us, and when you got your last loots.  While there is some consideration on when the person behind the toons looted last, in general each toon present is treated separately.  So you may have really really good days for loot and have some really really bad days as well.  Loots are<br>
distributed to the greatest good of the guild first and foremost.  If you have any questions about how this is done in fact, talk with members.  Most people are very happy with the system both for it's simplicity and the way that items have been awarded.<br>
<br>
Altus Domini adheres to what we call the higher standard.  Members of Altus Domini will not Train, flame in public channels, ninja loot, KS or other inappropriate activities.  AD is frequently in races with other guilds for mobs, and while we will aggressively pursue that race, we will make attempts to work with other guilds in an amiable manner.  This does not always work and conflicts will arise, but we will attempt to be &quot;Above the Rest&quot; in action and deed to the point of letting a mob go rather than sink to the level some folks go to.  <br>
<br>
Guild Leadership and their designated Officers will handle violations of etiquette, personal conflicts and disputes.  We will attempt to resolve disputes in a fair and levelheaded manner.  By wearing our tag you agree to try to resolve disputes the same way.  If you get mad at someone.take a break, let it pass then work it out.  If you have problems working it out get leadership help in resolving the dispute.  <br>
