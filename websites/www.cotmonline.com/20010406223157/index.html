<meta name="description" content="Followers of Tunare believe that we are all Tunare's children. The children of Tunare seek to help Norrath, which they believe to be a living and breathing being, to blossom and grow. Followers believe that the world of Norrath gave birth to Tunare and from her all life has sprung forth. Thus, by worshipping and protecting the land, followers are paying homage and respect to the Mother of their Mother, who in turn protects and provides for them. Followers of Tunare will fight to the death to protect nature in all its forms. Many druids, rangers, and a great many elves follow the ways of Tunare.">
