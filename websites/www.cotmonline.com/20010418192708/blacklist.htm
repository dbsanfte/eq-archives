          <h3>COTM Protected Creatures List </h3>
          <p>Most creatures are pretty obvious; if it is "Good" life, then we 
            don't kill it. If it is evil then we do. However there are a number 
            of creatures that are not so obvious, and some for which you cannot 
            make a blanket statement, like wolves or cats. Some wolves are evil, 
            and cats often aggro on even Rangers. In those cases, protect yourselves. 
          </p>
          <h3>We are the Good Guys though and try to promote goodness. </h3>
          <p>OFF-Limits:<br>
            Any Good Sentient Race </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>Aviaks, Centaurs, Treants, Unicorns, Frogloks are all verified)<br>
              Any Woodland MAMMAL (those beasties that have little beasties, not 
              ones that lay eggs) The Rodent family is excluded. (skunks, rats, 
              are all fair game) <br>
              Fairie Creatures, including Fay Drakes <br>
              <b> Exceptions:</b> Individuals known to be evil (Brownies, Bixies 
              or named individuals who attack good pc's regularly. In the case 
              of Mina Glimmerwing in Lfay, we know that she aggros on our younger 
              members. In that case, she is fair game, even though she looks like 
              a fairy. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><u><b>Question</b></u>: I do have a question though, posed by our 
            good friend Falcone. If Aviaks attack and kill Centaurs, are they 
            still a "Good" race? If two Good races are at war, do we (COTM) simply 
            maintain a neutral stance? <br>
            <b><u>Answer</u></b>: In legends throughout time, Fairie creatures 
            have been at War. They, like animals, are very terrotorial. In Tolkien's 
            novels The Elder races were totally at War; it did not make them evil. 
            So while Centuars and Aviaks fight each other, it is a Race War. We, 
            followers of Tunare, respect the Fairie Races and their views. We 
            do not take sides, we simply serve nature and protect the balance. 
            I am sure that if one or the other was threatened with Extinction, 
            then the Children would be called to aid in protecting the threatened 
            species. Would that then make us evil? Or would it mean we would always 
            count the opponent as an enemy? Nay, I say.it means that Tunare is 
            a greater purpose, and we serve her to promote life and the continuance 
            of each and every creature under Tunare's blessing. </p>
          <p>WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE FOR YOU PEOPLE WHO NEED TO KILL 
            ONE OF THE LISTED CREATURES TO DO SO. IF...IF IF IF IF IF you need 
            to kill one of these creatures you may petition one of the DRUID or 
            CLERIC Officers of the guild and tell him/her WHY you need to, and 
            you may or MAY NOT be granted that privilege. It is assumed that Tunare 
            Herself gives that holy conduit a sign or message whether the need 
            is great enough. You will receive a YES or NO, no arguments please. 
            You may petition another Officer at another time (min one game day) 
            to see if Tunare has changed her mind. </p>
          <p>Breach of these rules is grounds for instant loss of guild status. 
            In Tunare's eyes it is as great a crime to kill a wolf as it is a 
            Cat or Treant (sorry Nino) </p>
          <p><u><b>Question</b></u>: Where do corrupt Guards and Militia fall 
            in this scheme? <br>
            <b><u> Answer</u></b>: As a matter of True Earth History, druids were 
            not the nice helpful beings we in Norrath like to be. They despised 
            civilization, technology and the advancement of all things that promoted 
            it. They viewed "civilized" man as no better than cattle and had no 
            reservations about killing them and certain cults sacrificed infant 
            Man to their animal gods. We however do no such things, and we as 
            players of a game in which civilization is NECESSARY, turn a blind 
            eye to it. So instead we turn our discontent of civilization to the 
            corruption it produces. Hence the corrupt guards of Qeynos, and the 
            vile Milita of Freeport are men who have earned natures wrath. </p>
