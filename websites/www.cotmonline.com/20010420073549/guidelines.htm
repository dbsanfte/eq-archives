          <h1 align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Guild Guidelines</font></h1>
          <p align="left">As one famous poet said, "All you need is Love." 
          <p align="left"><b>RULE #1:</b> First and foremost, we are all visiting 
            Norrath to enjoy ourselves. It is that simple. 
          <p align="left"><b>RULE #2: </b>Whenever two people are in a room together 
            there is likely to be a difference of opinion. As a result, we set 
            a common set of goals and as a group strive for them. 
          <p align="left"><b>RULE #3:</b> A guild, Our Guild, is a group of like-minded 
            individuals struggling to overcome the challenges of Norrath as a 
            team. That does NOT mean that everyone has to think alike or act alike, 
            but it does mean that everyone must respect every other member of 
            the Guild. Mutual respect is our Golden Rule and guiding principle. 
          <p align="left"><b>RULE #4:</b> Intolerance and disrespect will be grounds 
            for a hearing and possible removal from the Guild. We are in this 
            together; see RULE #1. 
          <p align="left">This is a role-playing adventure. That does not mean 
            that we strictly adhere to a stringent set of rules. It does mean 
            that we are creating characters and personalities to inhabit those 
            characters. Let us be ruled by the virtues of Respect, Honor, and 
            Love. 
          <p align="left">It is important to realize that if you don't choose 
            to share these goals, then you should leave the Guild. The purpose 
            of the Guild is to serve its members, and if all are not committed 
            to that, then it will crumble. A few cannot meet the needs of all; 
            everyone must share in the responsibilities. That does not mean that 
            we have to give up advancing characters; it does mean some noble selflessness. 
          <h3 align="left"><b>Behavior</b> </h3>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Guild = Family:</b> This is our family on Norrath, and we are 
              to treat each other as such. Respect one another; that doesn't mean 
              you have to like one another - but you must show respect. </li>
            <li><b>Loyalty:</b> This means giving of yourself to serve a higher 
              purpose. Help build a better Norrath and a better Children of the 
              Mother. </li>
            <li><b>Flirting:</b> We are a role-playing guild. People are created 
              with all sorts of personalities. Please respect each other's differences; 
              please express yourselves with Decency and Good Taste as standards. 
              If there is a breach of that, please direct your observation to 
              an officer.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3> Officers</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Every officer should try to help the guild become a better place. 
            </li>
            <li>Officers should be more than willing to help their Guild Mates. 
            </li>
            <li>Officers should be willing to step up and give a little more than 
              others. </li>
            <li>However, officers are players too. Please show them some extra 
              consideration. </li>
          </ol>
          <h3 align="left">Policies</h3>
          <ol>
            <li> <b>Leadership:</b> There is a Guild hierarchy to ensure order 
              and compliance with certain principles. Non-compliance with those 
              rules will be met with, hopefully, common-sense and judicial discipline. 
              Remember, rules are made for those who cannot think for themselves. 
              The hierarchy is established according to goals that are identified 
              by a consensus of its members. It is not a dictatorship, nor are 
              the rules arbitrary. </li>
            <li><b>Anon:</b> If your second character or your main character is 
              lower than 15, you must go anonymous or role-play until you be come 
              15. This should stop any misrepresentations to non-members, especially 
              those who would like to be in the Guild. As for those who are above 
              15, it is their choice. It is preferential to not be anonymous, 
              but we must allow a choice because this is supposed to be a role-playing 
              adventure. </li>
            <li><b>Guildtag:</b> Some wish to be anonymous, but please if you 
              so choose, then go role-play so your guildtag will show. We should 
              all be proud of the guild.</li>
            <li><b>Guildsay:</b> Guildsay is a method to chat with all of us no 
              matter where we are. People are turning off guildsay due to bickering. 
              If you feel the need to have an argument, then do it in tell or, 
              better yet, seek an officer as a mediator. See Rule #4. </li>
            <li> <b>Complaints:</b> Whenever anyone gets or has a complaint about 
              a guild mate, the officers should know about it, all the way up 
              the chain of command. Drop me an e-mail arillorlei@cotmonline.com 
              and briefly tell me what happened. We do want to establish a positive 
              reputation both within our organization and outside of it. </li>
            <li><b>Chain of command:</b> This is our Guild, so you all stand as 
              an example of who the Children are, but on occasion there are questions 
              or even misunderstandings that arise. Officers are appointed by 
              the Guild Leader or are elected by the membership. They speak with 
              the full authority of the Guild Leader - meaning what he or she 
              says goes - period. If there is still a problem, then take it higher 
              up the chain, see number 6. We all, Human, Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, 
              Barbarian, Troll, are fallible. Please let's all work together. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Roster:</b> Please let us know if you see someone who has left 
              the guild and is still on roster. We would like to clean it up. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Kill Stealing:</b> Kill Stealing is NOT allowed. </li>
          </ol>
