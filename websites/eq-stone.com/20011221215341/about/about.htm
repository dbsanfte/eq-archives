       <dd>Stone is made up of a group of players that play on a regular basis, and would much rather group with other guild members then non-guildies. We would rather group with six Stone members and not have an enchanter then place our lives in the hands of an unknown. Being a member of Stone means you have proven to have a high level of skill and knowledge of your class and the game of Everquest. We assist each other in our search for spells, armor, weapons, and questing. While we do not "tweak" or "power level" our members we do feel that assisting our members makes the guild stronger. The greater good of the guild is an important part of our play style (i.e. By spending 3 days helping our rogues get their epic weapons, we make the guild more powerful and able to assist other members in their goals.) 
       <p>
       <dd>We like to challenge ourselves with new and exciting things. Pushing the limits of our skills and improving them (i.e. clearing fear with 10 people). Our goal is to do more with less. We don’t need a guild full of players when we can have a finely tuned well oiled machine. We always try to maintain as good a relationship as possible with the other players/guilds on the server by showing that we are a friendly, competent, and helpful guild. Of course we need to take care of our own first, but when we are able, we will assist others.
