<p><b> The Fell'd Foe, but of Whom?</b></p>

<p>Gather round my friends, my family.  Hear this tale of long ago; a tale of a great army united in one overwelming manuever, retreat.<br />
<br />
It happened upon a hill, in plane, in feeling.  It was the Plane of Fear that the Army of Stone tread bravy upon.  They had marched through the dark army of Cazic Thule; cast aside all his fallen angels reclaiming the treasures of heroes past.  I was there, I came over that hill...<br />
<br />
<br />
We had just vanquished one of three guardians of Cazic Thule, Fright, and as one of our noble healers, Hyten, cleared the hill to recover a fallen champion's corpse.  Upon reaching the hill top, he stumbled face to face with the Dracolich.  The same Dracolich who had completely wiped our army from the Plane of Fear twice that day; even though undaunted we returned.  <br />
<br />
As his still breathing corpse struck the ground a great cry went out through our ranks.  FLEE!  Flee into the far hills away from the great undead dragon!  But alas it was for folly.  With our cleric's energies depleted and several of our fine warrior's mangled corpses adorning the ground, the Dracolich came for us.<br />
<br />
In a scrambled plea for what was left of our lives, we collectively in that fine moment decided that fight we shall.  Fight we did.  Through the next few moments dispair turned to disbelief as we were still alive.  The dragon was being held at bay, but at any moment our lives could have been forfiet.  Soon though troubled minutes, that disbelief turned into great joy as sword strike, dagger plunge, and magic explosion fell the great beast.  With trembling hands we took stock of what we had done.  The foe who had conquered us in the name of his terrible master had been conquered.  <br />
<br />
As we moved through tending to our wounded, there in the twilight of a place you will never know;  the bones of this great dragon began to move.  A force higher than that of even the lord of that realm had taken notice of our achievement.  Though groteque, two identical girdles, no... trophies of our victory had been forged.   The army cried out in astonishment, but within a moment these gifts were gifted upon again.  Gifted to our leaders, our generals.   The army cried out for Souleach, the Iksar and Teakken, the halfling to strap these upon their hip as an everlasting memory.   <br />
<br />
Souleach held the two girdles high as the false dawn broke across the realm of Fear.  The necromancer handed the second of these girdles to his unlikely friend and equal, but Teakken did not accept.  Teakken had taken stock of what his army had accomplished in the last hour, and could not accept.  This was not to be though, as his selfishlessness would not withstand that of his troops that day.  As one voice, the guild of Stone cried out that if their druidic lord would not wear the girdle then no other would and it would rot in this place never to see the use of any hero with half the stature of the one that stood upon the Dracolich's remains.  What could the druid do, but relent?  As their army cheer, the Iksar and the Halfling strapped on these trophies, and with a tear the Halfling smiled and this troll chose not to feast upon him that day. <br />

<p>It's kind of embarrassing to be dubbed as a fallen champion and that a cleric pulled dracoliche by accident while looking for my body, heh but whatever works I guess. I just wish I could have been alive and joined in the fight. What a weird way for my getting deathtouched to help out stone <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""> It's all good. Grats you two.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting this Scaley Shaman tag along on your raid into Fear.<br />
<br />
And much thanks for letting me loot the Child's tear I needed for my Epic.  Now just 3 mobs remain between me and the Spear of Fate (High Scale Kirn, Queen what's her name and Lord whoever).  <br />
<br />
Hoping to get a couple of groups together soon and hit The Hole and give High Scale Kirn his Icon back.<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>
