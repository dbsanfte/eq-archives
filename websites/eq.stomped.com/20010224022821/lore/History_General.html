<center><b><font face="Old English Text MT"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>The
History of Norrath</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This is from the official Everquest site:</b>
<p><b>It is said that outside of space and time an entity known only as
the Nameless exists, and that this being created all that there is and
was and will be. It is also written in ancient texts that from His mind
sprang not only the universe and its countless suns and worlds, but also
a myriad of sentient, powerful, yet finite creatures whom one such as a
man, or elf, or dwarf, would call a god.</b>
<p><b>In aeons past came one of these gods upon the world Norrath. Veeshan,
Crystalline Dragon and ruler of the Plane of Sky, found this world pleasing
and deposited her brood onto the frozen continent of Velious. With one
swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened several great wounds upon the
surface of Norrath, staking her claim to this promising new world. Dragons
then walked the land and flew the skies, powerful beings of great intellect,
wisdom, and strength. Thus began the Age of Scale. In time the other gods
noticed Veeshan's work, and being often petty and jealous beings, they
too came upon Norrath, intent upon leaving their mark. Brell Serilis was
first, and from his Plane of Underfoot, a dark realm of vast caves and
endless tunnels, he quietly created a magical portal to a cavern deep in
the belly of Norrath. Through this portal the Duke of Underfoot seeded
the depths of Norrath with all manner of creatures. Brell then returned
home, sealing his portal within a labyrinthine chamber of mystical Living
Stone.</b>
<p><b>And when the other gods came to Norrath, Brell Serilis approached
each of them, and after some time convinced them to meet as one to discuss
the fate of the world. The Great Mother Tunare, and Prexus, The Oceanlord
were in attendance, and Rallos Zek, the warlord, was also there, yet in
mistrust kept his distance. Brell, carefully avoiding all queries as to
the origins of his information, told of Veeshan's discovery of the new
and potentially powerful world in which she had deposited her brood. Words
befit of the King of Thieves poured forth from Brell's lips and he proposed
that they accept an alliance of sorts, to which all save Rallos Zek agreed,
ignorant of the fact that Brell had already released some of his creations
into the Underfoot of this new world. The planet that would be called Norrath
was divvied up between these beings of power for&nbsp; the purpose of keeping
the Wurmqueen in check. Each would create a race of beings to watch over
Norrath and keep a vigilant eye on the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed
the bowels of the planet and created the Dwarves, stout and strong, deep
beneath the mountains of Norrath. In the abysmal depths of the oceans Prexus
left his children, the Kedge, hearty aquatic beings of great mental power
and stamina. And on the surface of Norrath did Tunare create the Elves,
creatures of limitless grace and beauty, and Rallos Zek the Giants, fierce
and formidable beings, intent upon the defense of their lands. Thus began
the Elder Age.</b>
<p><b>It was inevitable that such energies involved in seeding planets
with life would attract even more of the gods, and it was the Elves who
drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a decrepit
tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he ruled,
Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno.
He cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed
to make them regret such disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' fair
city, Takish-Hiz, the Prince of Hate snatched away the first Elven King
and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, physically
and mentally, over the course of three hundred years. He then gathered
the quivering remnants of these beings of light and rebuilt them into his
own dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children.
In depositing the Teir'Dal, as Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come
to be called, back into the Underfoot of Norrath, the seeds for The Prince
of Hate's final revenge were sown. Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane and Cazic-Thule
came next to Norrath, and Brell met them, concocting a second pact with
these latter gods, wishing another excuse to create more peoples into the
world. Rallos Zek again watched from afar, determined to add to his creation
as well, and this time Brell convinced the Warlord to join the pact, assuring
him that it was indeed an appropriate time to fulfill his desires. Deep
in the earth did Brell return to create the gnomes, resembling dwarves
to some extent, yet more wiry and gnarled, consumed with tinkering with
devices more so than their cousins. On the surface, away from Elves and
Giants, Bristlebane made the Halflings, short and stubby folk, agile and
with a propensity to meddle and even pilfer at times. Cazic-Thule, Lord
of Fear, was drawn to the swamps and jungles of Norrath and there created
the green skinned Trolls and reptilian Lizard Men. And Rallos Zek returned
to the surface, pleased with his sanction to create even more peoples for
his army. He made then the Ogres, massive, unmovable beings of questionable
intelligence, and the Orcs, bred for battle and singled-minded in their
desire for conquest.</b>
<p><b>By this time, those who are now known as the elder races of Norrath
had begun to expand and mature. Villages became cities, and cities became
kingdoms. Several of the races became bent on expansion and warfare became
part of their developing cultures. And of all the races, it was the Ogres
who quickly proved the most interested in battle and plunder, and their
empire grew outward from their mountain home until it eventually encompassed
a large portion of Tunaria, largest of the known continents. Their knowledge
of magic grew as did their greed, until they became weary of only Norrath,
and when they learned of other planes and dimensions, invaded the Plane
of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched with pride as his creations challenged
the gods of that realm, and when they eventually knew defeat, the Warlord
himself led a second invasion. The war that ensued shook the heavens and
angered the greater gods. Through their combined might, Rallos Zek was
finally thwarted and forced back to his domain, after which a great barrier
to the Planes of Power was erected, denying entry to both the lesser gods
and mortals as well.&nbsp; And then, in what some view as spite and others
justice, the gods cursed the Warlord's creations. Thousands of Ogres were
slain and their empire collapsed around them. The Giants were spread from
one end of the earth to the other, forced to flee their homes as the gods
brought snow and ice to their previously lush lands. And the goblins were
also cursed, but no writings remain of their punishment as they no longer
keep records of their history (which is perhaps some indication as to the
severity of their curse). Thus began the Age of Monuments.</b>
<p><b>As the dust settled, the last of the gods came to Norrath. Mithaniel
Marr, god of Valor, and Erollisi Marr, goddess of Love, created the Barbarians,
a hardy race who settled the cold and rugged northlands, near the ruins
of the Giant empire. Being the youngest race, they were generally unwashed
and rugged, possessing very few social graces. And while they too had a
warlike culture, there were those amongst them who began to believe in
something more. By this time the other civilizations of Norrath had either
long since declined, or were well on their way, and this small minority
of Barbarians saw an opportunity to triumph where the others had failed.
Perhaps this was a seed of wisdom planted by the Marr Twins, or perhaps
it was only by chance, but as the Barbarians spread out across the lands,
warring with both each other and any other race encountered, this tiny
movement continued to grow. And so even amidst desolation and war, there
was hope. Thus began the Age of Blood.</b>
<p><b>The last of the old races to decline was the empire of the Elves.
The Elddar Forest spread across the entire southeastern quarter of Tunaria.
Cities and villages built high into the trees housed thousands of Wood
Elves, and the marble cities of the High Elves were built in the forest's
clearings and meadows, their white towers and spires climbing out of the
forest, higher than the tallest tree. But then came the last curse of the
gods, as Solusek Ro, Lord of Flame, arched the spine of the serpent mountains,
bringing heat from the burning sun to the ancient forest. The rivers ran
dry, it rained less each year, and while the great elven druids fought
long and hard, using their powerful magics to combat the change, they could
only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest gave way to desert, and eventually
even great Takish-Hiz crumbled and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria,
leaving much of their greatness behind. Thus began the Lost Age.</b>
<p><b>This next period of Norrathean history as it relates to many of the
races is the least known. It is surmised by the more knowledgeable historians
that while the elder races regrouped and reestablished themselves, a small
group of Barbarians were suddenly transformed both physically and intellectually.
Most believe this to be the last major and direct act of divine intervention,
and perhaps the reason so little is known about this period is that the
gods wish it to be so, deciding afterwards that they would have less to
do with their creations. In any case, this small and enlightened group
were the fathers of the Human race, and they rapidly gained a foothold
throughout the lands, studying the lost art of geomancy. The Combine Empire,
as this lost race of Humans is called, spread throughout the known world,
but then died even more quickly than it grew, and for reasons still unknown.
And while they are the ancestors of every Human on Norrath and their relics
and ruins still litter the lands from Odus to Faydwer, little history of
this period remains.</b>
<p><b>After the fall of the Combine Empire, the remnants of mankind dwelled
mostly in the center of Tunaria, inhabiting primarily the vast and fertile
plains of Karana. Villages appeared and prospered, several reaching the
size of towns, and two even became cities. To the west a strong and noble
band of Humans, lead by Antonius Bayle the First, founded Qeynos under
the lofty principles of law. Freeport, to the east, became an active and
dangerous port of call for all who dared to venture into the Ocean of Tears.
Humanity, much to the disdain of the elder races who watched from afar,
remained strong, even daring to rename their home after one of their own
instead of one of the gods. The great continent of Tunaria would forever
more be known as Antonica. This is not to imply, however, that humanity
was at peace. Competition was fierce, and when resources grew scarce for
one reason or another many groups abandoned the promises and alliances
of their past and fought. A few leaders spoke out against the violence,
urging the masses to remember why they had fled the cold north. Others
reminded them of their former glory and the might of the Combine Empire.
These leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again to those principals
to which all had agreed. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with
tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions
of ancient abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge
of sorcery and the mystic arts.&nbsp; And when that discontent minority
of leaders heard all of this, they became both jealous and determined.</b>
<p><b>A small, frail man of great intellect called Erud led this group,
and he formed them into a council. They quickly became irritated, even
disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of spies behind,
the remainder of Erud's followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a
small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren
coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite
appealing to the council and their people. They quickly built a city of
their own, dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport,
for it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and
within it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered
and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought
to them by their spies. The first human mages since the Combine Empire
were born – wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls
of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and knowledge. Thus began the
Age of Enlightenment.</b>
<p><b>It came to pass some years later that a small group of Erudites discovered
the lost art of Necromancy. They were branded heretics and great conflict
arose. For the first time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought.
They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they
had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very
significant difference – they did not use swords and bows, but rather magic,
and the result was terrible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lives by the hundreds were lost,
great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were
forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus.
In one final battle, great mystic energies were released and an immense
hole leading to unknown depths beneath the earth was created. Into the
sides of this chasm the heretics built their own city which they called
Paineel. And while both sides still seethed with anger and hatred towards
one another, their fear of what the last battle had wrought has kept any
further conflict at bay. Thus began the Age of Turmoil.</b>
<p><b>It is in this age you find yourself, an age filled with wonder. The
elder races have begun to reclaim their former glory. The younger races
have matured, and an active economy stretches across Odus, Antonica, and
Faydwer. And while conflict and battle is hardly rare, it has also been
centuries since open war has plagued the lands. A myriad of alliances and
factions exist, friend and foe plot and scheme, and the world of Norrath
is ripe for action. Equip yourself for adventure, seek allies and knowledge,
and head out into a rich world of dungeons, towers, crypts, even planes
and realities beyond your imagination. Learn skills, earn experience, acquire
treasure and equipment, meet friends and encounter enemies. And whether
you assume the role of a noble human knight, a vicious dark elf thief,
a greedy dwarven merchant, or whatever suits your desire.</b>
