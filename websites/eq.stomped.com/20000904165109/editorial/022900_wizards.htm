<center><b><font size=+1>BEING A WIZARD IN A TWINKER'S WORLD</font></b></center>

<p><b>Greetings All!</b>
<p><b>After reading Allakhazam's comment on how many complaints he had
heard about the viability of Wizards in groups, I had to respond. I am
not here to tell you that Wizards are the ultimate class. I am not going
to say that Wizards are superior to all other classes. I am going to tell
you that Wizards are a VERY important part of any group, especially at
higher levels.</b>
<p><b>The problem is that we are now living in a twinkers world. Tanks
are reliant on powerful armors and weapons that can be used at very low
levels. Yes, verant has addressed this issue by creating a damage cap for
tanking classes at L20. However, a first level twinker tank in full bronze
with a FS two hander or a Lanseaxe (and yes, I have seen first level tanks
in FULL crafted carrying an Executioners Axe) is far more powerful than
a first level twinker wizard. That having been said, why would any tank
or group want a low level wizard in their group when a tank is just as
good? This concept holds true up to around L24. And in truth, it is not
until L34 that Wizards truly come into their own.</b>
<p><b>To illustrate my above point, a twinked tank at L21 (damage cap is
now removed) is now hitting for upwards of 40 or more damage with an Executioners
Axe, has regular critical hits, and has an ungodly AC around 500+ with
full crafted. Why does he need a wizard in his group who can only cast
Lightning Bolt (125 damage) with any consistency? Force shock may be a
L20 spell that hits for 170 damage, but it is so often resisted that it
is not a viable spell at that level.</b>
<p><b>Quite frankly, if I were that super twinked tank, I would want a
couple clerics at my back, and maybe a few mage/necro's with pets. "After
all", reasons the tank, "A mage can do as much damage as a wizard at that
level AND has a pet."</b>
<p><b>And, to a large degree, the tank is right.</b>
<p><b>But let it be said and let it be known, Wizards do not truly come
into their own until L34. Once a wizard hits level 34, they have no equal
in their own field. Let me repeat that: WIZARD'S ARE UNEQUALED IN POWER
IN THEIR OWN FIELD. This is not an idle boast. Wizards are about one thing
and one thing only: Burning mobs to the ground in as short a time frame
as possible. When you want it dead, and you want it dead NOW, there is
NO substitute for a wizard. None.</b>
<p><b>Wizards are all about Direct Damage. Either as Bolt, Shock, or AE
spells, wizards have the singular ability to inflict more damage faster
than any other class. Wizards have the ability to turn the tide of a battle
in seconds, rivaled only by the chanter's ability for crowd control. At
level 34, that super twinked tank is just about maxed out in ability. Sure,
his attack and defense ratings will continue to go up, but his level of
damage will not increase that significantly. However, from L34 on, our
power grows almost exponentially. I have seen tanks up to L40 hit for 80
damage a swing, crit for 180, and have over 1600 hitpoints. And I at Level
39 have almost 1700 mana, or the ability to chain cast 9 Lightning Strike
Spells of 380 damage each. Do the math. I have the capacity to deliver
3420 direct damage to mobs in under a minute. A mage with pet may do more
damage in a longer period of time, and necro's, shamans, and druids can
do more damage over time than we can. But NOTHING compares to our sheer
knockdown ability.</b>
<p><b>I need to point out too that many people that I have grouped with
fear the wizard class. I am afraid that wizards have gathered a bad name
for themselves. I can't tell you how many times I have seen a caster over-burn
a mob and get it stuck on himself. I know one particular mage who likes
to burn a mob as hard as he can right at the beginning of a battle. Ok,
that particular mage runs around the battle (with a mob attatched firmly
to his tail) screaming "GET IT OFFA ME!!!". Geee, he is running around
, the tanks can't get a lock on the dang mob to pull it off of him, and
the cleric is over worked trying to get a lock on him to cast heals! It's
all I can do sometimes but to try and root every mob in the room, or AE
snare them with Bonds of Force. Sigh. That type of activity will and should
get you kicked from a group.</b>
<p><b>This brings me to my second, and perhaps the most important point
about wizards. We are paid to think. If you can't stand sitting back and
surveying a battle to determine how to best spend your limited mana points,
then change classes. That's right. Much like clerics, we wizards should
be the last classes to engage a mob in battle. Let the tanks run up and
the pets jump in. Let the Necro's, Shaman's, and Druids dot. My job is
to calmly stand up, back away from the battle (if possible), and survey
the situation. I look for many things before I do anything. Questions to
ask include:</b>
<p><b>1. How many mobs are there?</b>
<br><b>2. What type of mobs are out there? Caster/healer mobs or straight
tank mobs?</b>
<br><b>3. What are the abilities of the mobs? Root? Harm Touch?</b>
<br><b>4. Can the tanks comfortably handle the mobs alone?</b>
<br><b>5. Communication to the group</b>
<br><b>6. Who am I assisting?</b>
<br><b>7. Aggro?</b>
<br><b>8. EVAC?</b>
<br><b>9. And my favorite question: DD or AE or Stun?</b>
<p><b>There are many more concerns that I have when in battle. One major
concern is runners. Mobs that run are very bad news. Hehe, a good time
to hit EVAC without even thinking is when a high speed runner takes off
down a dungeon hallway with the Chanters pet attached to it! The train
that will return will annihilate most parties in seconds! I pay VERY close
attention to the party's healers: If they start getting hit by a mob, that
is my cue to stun, root, or just plain burn the mob into cinders.</b>
<p><b>It is also not a bad thing to pull a mob off of another player if
you know what and why you are doing it. If I see one of the tanks getting
hit hard, I will go full burn on a mob and do everything I can to pull
it off the tank. Generally speaking, I tell tanks NOT to Assist me if a
mob pulls to me. Why? If a mob pulls to me, I use a stun/root combo and
leave the mob in a corner of a room, well out of our way. A good example
of this is the Avatar Room in Cazic Thule. This is a wonderful room to
fight in with lots of room to move around in. It is easy for me to nuke
from 75 feet away, intentionally pull the mob to me, and root it off in
a corner. This is in effect the wizard version of "Mezzing" a mob. There
is nothing worse than that little caster running all over a room with a
mob stuck to him.</b>
<p><b>Just a note on unintentional pulling of mobs from a battle: do not
run around like a chicken with your head cut off! If you have to run, there
is only one direction to go. Run back to your tanks, and STOP right in
front of your tanks. At least you brought the mob back to the tanks so
they don't have to chase you around a room.</b>
<p><b>Communication is one of the great challenges that face a wizard.
If you have a chanter in your group, does that rule out the use of AE spells?
If you have a druid/ranger in your group, does that free you from root
duties? Does your cleric have the reagents (CEA's, Bloodstones, Jaspers)
to Symbol your tanks? What can you, with the viewpoint of a wizard, offer
to a party that exceeds the result of your spells? Truly this is what separates
a good wizard from the lesser wizards.</b>
<p><b>Just a few notes on AE spells. I have read that if you target your
tank and cast on him, you can cast AE spells to your hearts content.</b>
<p><b>NOT TRUE!</b>
<p><b>There is a theory that if you cast on the tank, the mobs see the
damage as being done by the tank. This is wholly false. At earlier levels,
up to around level 20, this may be true because in many cases the tank
is dishing out more damage and is constantly taunting the mob (s). However
at higher levels, this concept is totally false.</b>
<p><b>I am L39, and my two favorite spells AE spells are Thunderclap (PB
AE) and Circle of Force. For this discussion, only Circle of Force is applicable
which is a ranged AE spell. CoF hits for 214 damage per mob.</b>
<p><b>There is a GREAT thread in the discussion forum about AE use, and
I HIGHLY recommend that you read it. But in a nutshell, casting AE's is
all about aggro. In short, the primary mob that the tank is attacking must
take MORE aggro from the tank than your spell creates!</b>
<p><b>Example: Your tank does 300 points of damage to the primary mob.
CoF hits for 214. Result? Mobs stay stuck to the tank and do not pull off.
However if the tank did only 100 damage before the CoF hits, YOU WILL PULL
MOBS. Why? Because you, the caster, have created more Aggro to yourself
than the Tanks aggro.</b>
<p><b>Mathematically it looks like this:</b>
<p><b>Wizard total Aggro &lt; Tank total aggro</b>
<p><b>Your Aggro level must remain LESS than the tanks aggro level.</b>
<p><b>This becomes very complicated to judge when you are in a group with
multiple tanks. I regularly group with 2 or 3 tanks, plus a pet or two.
The problem is that since all the tanks are damaging the mob, it is very
difficult to get a good read on who has aggroed the mob the most. Imagine
that 4 tanks (including pets) have done 600 damage to a mob with 1200 hitpoints
(Cazic Thule Lizzies and gators). Further, assume that each tank has done
the same damage, 150 damage each. If my CoF AE spell hits right when the
mob is at 50% health, the 214 damage that CoF does creates MORE aggro than
the tanks have created individually. Result? I pull mobs.</b>
<p><b>Most often I pull only one mob, and its a non-caster mob. My solution
is to Stun/Root the mob and walk away from it, leaving it to be addressed
later.</b>
<p><b>The AWESOME potential destructive power of Wizard AE spells are what
truly define the class. NO OTHER CLASS has the power of a Wiz AE. Druids
would rank a distant second. Mage AE spells are rains (which still suck),
or PB AE, and their power doesn't even come close.</b>
<p><b>Yes, Wizards have the greatest variety and have the most powerful
DD spells in the game, but it is our ability to destroy multiple mobs so
quickly that creates instant respect.</b>
<p><b>In one battle in Cazic Thule for instance, our group camped the lower
Throne Room (Lizzie cloak and mantle spot). We were trained by upper TR
by 6 lizzies. Our group consisted of 3 tanks, Shaman, Bard, and Myself.
CAREFUL timing of my AE spells resulted in several 5 or 6 mob hits with
AE's. Net result: OVER 3200 aggregate damage to 6 mobs, 50% mana remaining,
one pulled mob rooted and left to the side. I had 3 bubs of health when
all was said and done.</b>
<p><b>All I am saying is, know how to use your AE's, know when to use them,
understand mob aggro, and PRACTICE AE's when your group pulls two mobs.</b>
<p><b>I hope I have made my point. Wizards are not the best class in the
game. FAR from it. We have a singular duty in group applications which
is to really give a mob a bad day. And we do it better than any other class
in the game. We are the artillery, fighting with huge damage spells but
lacking any armor. You must think before you cast. But I can tell you this.
We are an awesome class to behold. Try forming a group consisting of a
tank (paladin/ranger/bard preferred), 4 wizards, and a chanter. Four L34
wizards can deliver 1250 damage to a singular mob in about 6 seconds. The
tank pulls and holds mobs for you. The chanter mezzes and keeps the wizard
drugged up on clarity (ooooooh!). I tell you this, Cazic Thule was never
the same when we finished with the sewers that day…</b>
<p><b>Good Luck!</b>
