<center><b><font face="Old English Text MT"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Miragul's
Story</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Taken from the official site:</b>
<p><b>Over three thousand years in the past humanity was in its infancy.
Mankind dwelled in the center of Antonica, spreading out slowly to inhabit
the vast and fertile plains of&nbsp; Karana. Villages appeared and prospered,
several reaching the size of towns, and two even became cities -- Qeynos
to the west, and Freeport to the east. Humanity, much to the disdain of
the elder races who watched from afar, was strong -- it rapidly gained
a solid foothold in the world of Norrath and was there to stay.</b>
<p><b>This is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace. Early
on small groups formed, some linked by similar appearances, others by common
goals. Competition was fierce, and when resources grew scarce for one reason
or another many groups abandoned the promises and alliances of their past
and fought. A few leaders spoke out against the violence, urging the masses
to remember why they had fled the cold north. They had broken away from
the lands of Halas and their barbarian brothers in the name of peace, and
these leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again to those principals
to which all had agreed.</b>
<p><b>Their cry was not totally ignored, and the fighting subsided. Villages
were encouraged&nbsp; to trade with one another and to respond to competition
nonviolently. An economy based largely on agriculture appeared and the
villages and small towns were surrounded by large farms. Most of humanity’s
leaders were pleased with this, wanting nothing more than peace and food
on every man’s table after a hard day of work. A few, however, wanted more.
Even though their people had risen well beyond the standard of living endured
by their barbarian brothers to the north, they were not&nbsp;&nbsp; content.
Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves,
and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient abandoned
cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the
mystic arts.</b>
<p><b>And when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of this, they
became both jealous and determined. A small, fragile man of great intellect
called Erud led this group, and he formed them into a council. They quickly
became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small
network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud’s followers fled the city
of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and
landed upon the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse
and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and their people. They
quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost every way to both
Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin
it was called, and within it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves
High Men, gathered and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and
other artifacts brought to them by their spies. The first human mages were
then born – wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls
of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and knowledge.</b>
<p><b>One of the more adept practitioners of the arts was named Miragul.
Unlike and more extreme than the others, he not only abhorred his human
brothers on the mainland to the east, but he also grew to hate his fellow
Erudites. To him they were both short sighted and narrow. They created
schools of thought, categorizing magic into three groups and designing
themselves to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, and Enchanters. Miragul
found this limiting and thoroughly resented the thought of being restricted
to one school of thought or another.</b>
<p><b>He soon found others who felt similarly. They were a small but growing
group of outcasts who often studied forbidden texts and other knowledge
generally kept secret from the majority of students. The council was morally
and ethically&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opposed to much of the information gathered
afar by their spies. Miragul found that these outcasts not only studied
the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was called Necromancy
and a few lucky spies had returned from a distant underground city (Neriak,
it was called, home of the dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient
texts describing&nbsp; this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful
magic, created for himself four identities, four separate countenances
and names, and joined all four schools without the knowledge of the council,
nor anyone else for that matter.</b>
<p><b>It came to pass some years later that the council, in its ever growing
desire to know all there was to know, both in distant lands and also in
its own city, discovered the group of Necromancers. They were branded heretics
and a great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years,
the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar
to that which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But
there was one very significant difference – they did not use swords and
bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds
were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the
heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern
regions of Odus.</b>
<p><b>Miragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind to the
implications when the conflict began. He left the heretics before they
fled the city, abandoning his fourth identity and siding apparently with
the council. But this was only a ruse in order to buy time. He soon gathered
every artifact and tome he could discreetly steal and then left Odus entirely,
taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of
men, however, were not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite
spies.Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. He headed
far to the north and then to the east, wishing to avoid the barbarians
of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the great lake called
Winter’s Deep and he hid there for some time.</b>
<p><b>While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed
and planned, and looked over every letter of every scroll and tome he had
taken from Erudin. Time passed and his understanding and power grew. But
he was unsatisfied&nbsp; and a deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge
ate away at him. He soon left his hiding place and began to travel long
distances in search of more ancient texts and artifacts. His power had
grown and confidence overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once again he
cloaked himself in false identity and countenance and traveled the lands
of men.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul
soon found another of the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale.
The mage feared these small people and their propensity to sneak and to
steal, and as his treasures grew in both size and value, he eventually
made the decision to move even farther north, and away from all intelligent
life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond the range of both Erudite
spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra. This land
had no name, and was not until centuries later referred to as merely the
Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed to Miragul’s
heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge and the abstract,
and filled with only hatred for others. Creatures with intelligence forced
him to be discreet and slowed his acquisition of&nbsp; knowledge and items.
He had as little to do with them as he could, only hiding amongst them
when absolutely necessary.</b>
<p><b>Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large
network of tunnels and rooms in which to hide and study his collection.
He used no labor, but rather deep magic to remove the earth from his way.
Room after room, passage after passage, he did create to house his store
of artifacts. He split his years, spending one score out in the world,
exploring and amassing knowledge and items, returning them&nbsp; to his
cache, and then the next dabbling with them, experimenting in one of several
laboratories he had created.</b>
<p><b>Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though
he did&nbsp; his best to extend his life using magical means. There was
a limit to his enlightenment when it came to aging, and he soon acknowledged
that one day even he would die. Only one aspect of death did he fear, and
being no longer able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. As his
skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul’s time was spent less
exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the existential. He soon
discovered the various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the Planes
of Power and Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse these
planes, making portals that led between them. But his strength was leaving
him, and his&nbsp; journeys into these realities were short and often unprofitable.
More and more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the
specter of death haunted him daily.</b>
<p><b>The mage’s research into life and death was built upon a foundation
he had learned from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy,
more than any other art, became Miragul’s obsession. Eventually he discovered
a means by which to create portals within his own plane and made them to
travel great distances in mere seconds. He traveled back to Odus, to its
southern regions, in search of the other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused,
they had unearthed by now a way to cheat death.</b>
<p><b>The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city
into a&nbsp; great hole that led to unknown depths beneath the earth. This
chasm was apparently the result of that huge civil war from which Miragul
had fled centuries earlier. The city, called Paineel, though somewhat suspicious,
allowed Miragul to enter and after a time he earned its inhabitant’s trust.
Many humored the old man and his claims, while a select few respected him
and were willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, power for power. They
revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to raise the
dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their master.
Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies of undead,
to wreak revenge upon the council that had exiled and made war upon them
in centuries past.</b>
<p><b>One important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, the
fact that the undead ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless and the
elderly mage knew that he must discover a way to be like them. He feigned
interest in the heretic’s goals, learning spells to raise the dead, helping
them raise their undead army. All the while, however, he was&nbsp; experimenting
himself, hiding much of his research in the small home he was given in
Paineel. After some time he discovered that which he had sought, a way
to transform a living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead. Unfortunately,
time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead himself, his body deteriorating
with age, and the heretics were almost ready to make war once again.</b>
<p><b>Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling
life energies to make a portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to
the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently to his most secret laboratory
and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the while of endless exploration
and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment. The enchantment
laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid&nbsp; his remaining
and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered
from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then
dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage,
what ancient scripts and legends called a lich.</b>
<p><b>In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich,
while retaining all the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit.
Only the mage’s soul, now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the
cache, retained the ambition and desire to amass knowledge and power. The
spiritless lich possessed none of these human traits, and Miragul’s soul
screamed in silence as the undead creature began to aimlessly wander his
menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with artifacts
of power.</b>
