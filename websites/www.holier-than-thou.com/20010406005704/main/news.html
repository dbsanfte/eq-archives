<br>GASP!  Don't be surprised.. yes, an update!  Haven't been playing EQ the past 2 weeks, yet here I am!  Anyway, just proving to everyone that we STILL CAN gain access to edit the farggin website.  If you can't connect through the IP, try connecting directly to the webaddress, that would be www.holier-than-thou.com for the phD students.  Email me - j1chen@umail.ucsb.edu - if you need to confirm/reconfirm login/password.  The members page is in sad shape; email me your updates and I'll put them in.  If you're lucky, I might even decide to put it in a new skippy format.  Have a nice day!  P.S. How is Gems?

<br>I was thinking of having this event on saturday the 24 of june in the Arena.<br> 
Time not known yet. 
<br>
In this event all high and low lvl members of HTT can join. You must create a dark elf shadowknight or high elf paladin and get him / her to lvl  9 ( not higher or lower ). 
I would be real fun if we could have 2 full groups for both sides. High elf group is leaded by Veeberg, Dark elf group is leaded by Saphyr. 
<br>
I would like to ask you to start collecting FS weapons, wooden shields, food, water and beer for the event. Also the people with a very high blacksmithing skill can make sets of Banded armor ( hope money isn't a problem ). 
<br>
The Rules : 
<br><br>
1 - All players will be using FS weapons, wooden shields and full sets of Banded armor. <br>
2 - Spell casting is allowed. <br>
3 - Twinking is not allowed. <br>
4 - Killing group members is not allowed. <br>
5 - High lvl buffs are not allowed. <br>
<br>
FAQ : <br><br>

Where is the Arena ? : <br>
The Arena zone can be found in Lake Rathetear. <br><br>

How do we get there ? : <br>
We will provide Teleports to North Karana and Feerott, from there High lvl players will escort you to the arena. <br><br>

Where do we need to get a bind ? : <br>
We will all bind in the arena. <br>

Can I invite friends ? : <br>
You may invite friends.. but they may not join the slaughter unless they are in fully banded with a fs weapon and using a lvl 9 shadowknight or paladin. <br>

Is there a price for the winning team ? : <br>
No, we have this event for the fun, not for the loot :) <br><br>

That's all, hope to see you all in the Arena.. Greetz, <br>

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">June, 07</font> I couldn't resist a tiny update today.  Raids raids raids!  Looking through our message board I see two raids that are being set up.  On Friday, 8pm Central (6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern), Gabbi and Seein are hosting a raid of Runnyeye for the lower levels.  Then, on Saturday, 3pm Central (1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern) Vee and Saph are piligizing Sol A.  I encourage those interested to make a post showing their interest.  I probably won't participate in any raid, but I'll pop my head in to see if anyone needs any taxing.  If you've died, I mean been, on an HTT guid raid, I encourage you to suffer, er experience, it - they are a lot of fun.  Another suggestion is for the leaders of the raid to have a specific goal in mind.  It's always funny to rally a bunch of people together, enter a dungeon, then scratch your ass while you think of something to do - decide this before hand, hell make a list.<BR>Lerene Ramblin' Llanowar

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">June, 06</font> Updated some levels and posted a bunch of member screenshots and 'other' screenshots - be sure to check them out, they look great!  I'll also take the time to say that there may not be anymore website updates until after June 16th.  I'm sure you guys can live without my pesky for news for 10 days though.  Be safe.  <BR>Lerene Llanowar

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">June, 03</font> Today a group of us, myself, Saphyr, Epyion, Veeberg, Zantoz, and Qanya participated in a raid of Kedge Keep.  At first things didn't look so good.  As most of you know, this raid involved 3 guilds, HTT, The Holy Empire, and The Elven Alliance.  We were ready to go at the drop time but it took the other 2 guilds over and hour to get their groups set.  We start off directionless - basically one guy appointed another guy to be leader, and that guy didn't want to be leader.  Our group, being the frustrated bitches that we are, begin to get uneasy and asked for a list of goals for the raid - no one said anything.  So we decided that we would lead the raid instead.  Zantoz, being the 'leader of men' that he is took that reigns and did a spectacular job.  Our group ended up getting most of the experience on the raid as we did the most work =)  Zan led us to Phin's (leader of Kedge) chamber and through the battle with Phin - we got through it all with no deaths.  Phin ended up dropping a very nice robe (I believe it's called the Kedge Robe) which none of us won =)  <BR>Lerene Llanowar

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">June, 01</font> There are a few notable tidbits to post today.  If I'm not mistaken, tonight we're heading to Kunark to assist Vee in getting his 'jade.'  I'll start a thread on the message and try to get a sound off as to who is going.  Secondly, there are talks of a guild alliance spimming around now.  I have a few comments to make on this.  Before we get involved, ask yourself, what would be the purpose of being in an alliance?  The benefits are clear - but is that what you really want?  Remember, Holier Than Thou is not about the uber guild mentality - we're a group of friends first - period.  We've all spit evils at the power guilds (who shall remain nameless) of Xegony - is this alliance our attempt to be as powerful as them?  Also keep in mind that once we're in an alliance we're not going to have nearly as much control over 'guild' issues as we have before.  We're going to be connected to several other guilds, and what they do is their business, but our name is tied to it.  Doing a Kedge raid with another guild is one thing, but an alliance is another.  Personally, I know painful little abou the Holy Empire and nothing about the Elven Alliance.  Lets communicate before we jump into anything.  If anyone from the Holy Empire or the Elven Alliance is reading this bit of news - I welcome and encourage you to post on our boards.  And to HTT: The scrunity by which we judge prospective members should be equal to or greater than the degree to which we judge alliance status.  We got this far by sticking together.<BR>Lerene "Always Has the Jacked Up Point of View" Llanowar


<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">May, 28</font> Not much happy news today...  Sincerise respectfully took her leave today.  On behalf of the guild Sincerise, you will be missed.  Although your stay here was short - your presence was felt and we all wish you the best of luck in your future excursions - keep in touch.  HTT has lost quite a few members in the past few weeks - Nosfar, Shaedon, Nunsa, and now Sincerise.  Some left for reasons unknown, some left with scorn, and some politely bowed out.  Whatever the case - it's always a rough loss for the guild.  That said, I'd like to send my warmest thanks out to those who have stuck with us through the thick and the thin.  We've had a lot of drama and things haven't always been smooth.  But, I say this as member who has been along for only half the ride.  Those who have been here longer than I, and especially those who have been here since day 1 have truely endured.  Without your devotion to HTT this guild would be no more.  Still, better and brighter days lie ahead for Holier Than Thou.  Oh yea, updated a ton of screenshots too, but they are still not organized nicely - I'll get on that ASAP.<BR>Lerene Llanowar

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">May, 27</font> The Mistmoore raid last night was a great success.  Thanks to all that came!  This will include in no particular order Epyion, Sincerise, Dikmer, Zantoz, Qanya, Bandolmer, Binanar, Allass, Kletus, Kaldek, Saphyr, Khaen, Apok, and myself.  We got the hilt for Epyion (he'll be a flaming paladin soon!), an Icon for Kletus, and many many pieces of mistmoore granite (5 in total I believe).  While the castle group had no casualties the Graveyard and Frontyard group needed a few resses =)  All in all, I'd have to say that the raid went very very well.  The highlight of the event was went Zantoz got stuck in one of the closest of the bugged room =D  "SOMEONE GET ME OUT OF THIS LITTLE ROOM!!!!"  I would like to see more events like this - we pretty much got 100% participation from all online HTT members and we all had a good time kicking ass and taking names.  Special thanks to Saphyr and Khaen for staying up extra late to join us.  If you want your name in the members page to link to graphics page - send in your screenshots!<BR>Lerene Llanowar

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">May, 26</font> Tonight we rape and pillage Mistmoore >=)  I've made some tiny updates to the site which include the members page and I added some screenshots (thanks Saph!)  Now that the members page is updated and in working order I am going to start playing around with the screenshots.  Over the course of the next few weeks I'm going to try to revamp the screenshots page and make it more - well - interesting.  I I apologize that it's nothing more than a bunch of text links right now.  Send me all your cool screenshots so that I have something work with - and post any ideas you may have about <bold>organizing</bold> and making the section more fun.  Anyone who wants to help should feel MORE than welcomed to drop me a line.  I need ideas - lets talk.  There are a lot of things I'd like to do with this page but its going to take a group effort.  If there is enough interest in the guild we will make this work.<BR>Lerene Llanowar

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">May, 24</font> Warning.  Crazy druid now has control.  Thats right, Zantoz has gone out on a limb and given me access to butcher er... 'edit' the site.  Feel free to send me all your character updates.  I'll try my best to update without you having to email me, but I'll probably fall behind in this so don't count on it =)  My email should be linked now in the members page.<BR>Lerene Llanowar

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">May, 9</font> To those who have found their way beyond our fold, I wish you peace.  I have found your company pleasing and I hope you find what you are seeking. "time cures nothing, only the open heart forgiving can touch the flame within, seek to open not cut"<BR>Peace, Zantoz Bombadill

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">April, 8</font> Well, we've moved hosting solutions and URLs.  Please let me know if you see any glaring mistakes.  I have restructured the site so as to be more logical and less crowded in certain directories.  I'll be making updates to levels and characters today.  Let me know.  On to newer and brighter days.<br>Zantoz 'Had to go to work anyway, got stuck there, so I figured what the hell, all my tools are here to make the changes.' Bombadill

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">March 9,</font>  This week on "As the Guild Turns", Dr. Gilmore tells Zantoz he only has 3 months to live, so he takes some time off from Everquest to realize his life long dream of setting the world record for plugging as many chickens as he can in one hour. Lady Kanarra realizes that her current guild can't meet her planar needs and so leaves to join the Scientologists. The Guild, leaderless, flounders until Veeberg consolidates his powerbase and makes a hostile takeover. Dikmer and Zantoz, lacking the funds for the hugely successful negative campaign ads, both drop out of the running early on in the race.  Saphy, having used up his 'weapon' on cheap hookers in Vegas, decides to rob Sir Lucien of his 'manhood' and straps it on for himself. Billy Jean King would be proud.  Tree hugging, bear massaging, Nosfar finds himself in a new limbo land then is struck down by the gods for a seemingly random act of opinion. And finally, Dikmer, realizing that he is missing his favorite boy in blue, pledges an oath to powerlevel Zantoz upon his return. (This fanasty/interpetation_of_the_news should be looked upon humorusly)<br>Zantoz 'Still waiting for that stupid thing to compile' Bombadill

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">February 25,</font>  After that intriguing post from Zantoz I feel it necessary to make a post today (And the server is down).  I updated some levels, I know in 15 minutes they will be outdated again.<br>Id also like to welcome Chlor and Vynd to the madness.<br>Im finding it difficult to keep up with everyones levels so Im going to enlist the help of Binanar.  Please report all level changes to him.  Thats all the news for this month!<br>Kanarra Imanaz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">Feeblewary, 'wonyfith</font> Just have a wonky time in Everquest.  Thought I'd write you all a note saying "Mesa Wuvvie Yous Berry, Berry Mucha!"  Feeling in general silly.  Check out <a href="http://www.tiebreakers.com/~htt/swapper/exp_chart.xls"> this</a>  and don't ask where I got it.<br>Zantoz Bombadill

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">January, 25</font> Once again I would like to welcome new members, Sinderella, Allass and Saphyr, Welcome Aboard, we are glad to have you.<br>I would also like to welcome Nosfar back, he was missed and I am thrilled to have him back. <br> For those that missed it, the gathering at the Arena friday was a blast.  Thanks to Veeberg for taking the time to put the event together. <br> I would also like to take a minute to explain what Holier Than Thou is all about for those that pass by our site and deem it necessary to insult me in my email.  HTT was built by a small group of friends that find amusement in people like you who are so uptight, or dense (im not sure which), that you cant look past the name and see us for what we really are.  It is all of the people that take the time to send me hate mail that keep the spirit of this guild alive.  Despite the grammatical/spellingerrors on this OBVIOUSLY hastily put together site, none of our members lack so much purpose in life that we feel a need to travel through gaming guild sites correcting spelling errors or insultingits members sense of humor.  Perhaps I should change the superior intellect statement to superior common sense.<br>Kanarra Imanaz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">January, 11</font> I would like to be the first to say goodbye to Nosfar.  Sad as it may be, Nos informed me last night that he was leaving the guild.The reasons for leaving are not known to me as he chose not to explain.  I wish Nosfar the best of luck in EQ and I will certainly miss him as Im sure the rest of htt will as well. <br>  Xirus, one of our newest members, has also decided to leave htt in an attempt to find a guild closer to his level.Good luck to you both.<br>Kanarra Imanaz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">January, 7</font> Belated Happy New Year!!  I apologize for my lack of updates on the site, as I find myself approaching level 50 I find it harderto break away from the game to work on the site.  I have updated members levels (I hope they are all right) and am currently working on getting some more member images and screenshots posted as well.  See you guys in game, <br>Kanarra Imanaz<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">December, 22</font> Members Levels have been updated as far as what I knew when I camped last night.  Please let me know if I need to change any.I also have alot of screen shots to post, I will work on those as soon as my work situation settles down a little. Congrats to Epyion on aquiring his GB.<br>Kanarra Imanaz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">December, 6</font> Once again I would like to welcome our two newest members.  Orsk, level 30 warrior and Xirus, level 7 magician.  I would also liketo welcome Veeberg back, he has been away for a few weeks and it wasn't until a couple nights ago that I realized just how  lively guildsay hasn't been in his absence.  <br>Also, I have added a couple more charcter images on the members page. Please keep sending them and I will get them up time permitting.<br>Kanarra Imanaz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">December, 1</font> Speaking of soapboxes: Last night (or rather this morning) was one of the more rewarding times I have had in the guild and I benefited only minorly from that night.  My feeling of reward came out of working with my guild mates, helping them make a long term dream come true, yelling across the world so that we would gather and helping one of our own get set up to gain exp and treasure, for no real benefit to ourselves.  I was very proud of my guildmates last night, and though my time in the game may decrease (work is calling me hard these days) I'd have to say I am happy to have chosen this crew.  More and More, lets try to gather and build these trusted groups for goals that are not solely for own benefit. (*weeps*) <br>Zantoz "girly man" Bombadill

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">November, 28</font> The last two nights have been alot of fun.  Congrats to Zantoz, Qanya, Canar and myself for levelingmultiple times today.  The trip to permafrost was a profitable venture for everyone involved.  We all got something from it but most importantly Zantoz gotthe remaining component for his leggings. <br>While Im here I just want to say that I have learned a valuable lesson in the last couple weeks.  I have spent themajority of my game time primarily concerned with my own levels and getting myself the best equipment out there.  I got so wrapped up in this that I didnt noticethat everyone else is in need of things too.  A couple days ago I traded off an executioners axe and got a pretty good deal.  I got several things only two items that I could use.One of those items was the ivy etched helmet which I am now wearing, the other was a serpentine bracer which I had to give to Endymion in exchange for the one he gave me way back when.The other items were pretty much useless to me and my intention was to sell or trade them so I could get better leggings for myself.  After looking around at other guild membersI realized that I am not the only person in the guild and certainly not the most in need.   So, I gave my staff of writhing and Bi Crown to Zantoz.  I believe at this point in time Vilariis in possesion of my Glowing Wooden Crook, Addy has my Mistmoore shield and Veeberg has my BS tunic.  Some of those items were given as gifts others were requested to be returned upon getting a better replacement.At this point I would like for anyone who has any of my belongings to keep them as gifts from me.  They are yours now to do with what you please.  If needed for trade items that is fine too.  <br>I have had more fun in the last couple weeks hanging out with you guys and working together to get things that we all need.  I hope that this continues, the best fun Ive had in the game since we all firststarted together.  I know a couple of you will laugh at all this, some of you will take offense but what it all boils down to is that we all came together for fun and for support and to be honest whenthat is happening it turns out to be the best time in the game.<br>*Kanarra steps down from the podium*  

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">November, 18</font> Again, Id like to welcome two more members, Karm and Valia.  Welcome to the Loony Bin <br>Kanarra Imanaz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">November, 15</font> Holier Than Thou would like to officialy welcome Nosfar (lvl 29 Druid).  Please be sure to ask him to teleport you as much as possible!<br>Kanarra Imanaz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">November, 5</font> I am happy to announce that I am back.  The time off has proven to be exactly what I needed.  I had a little time to refocus my attention and remind myself of why it is that I play this game in the first place.  To kick off my return, Canar, Myself, Zantoz, Epyion Dikmer and Qanya (not necessarily all in the same place at the same time) Ventured out to have some fun as a guild.  As usual, we ALL died!  I have to say, thanks for living up to the Holier Than Thou expectations..I had a blast.  Thanks For taking over while I was gone Zantoz! <br>Kanarra Imanaz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">October, 28</font> Ah, poor Kanarra.  Feeling as I did recently, but luckily, my guildmates are coming through for me.  In the message area find the wish list for SolA.  We are planning to learn and dominate the zone that is SolA.  Next on the list of areas is Guk and Cazic.  Guk has a horde of 28-32 mobs that we can kill in very rapid succession, provided we have a full group.  And without the dreaded (and loved) Rubicate, Cazic has been light on the moron factor. Also, some minor level changes made on the site. AND if you get bored go <a href="items_hunt.htm"><font color="#DBDB00">here</font></a> and see my proposed Wish List.  Limit 5 items per member. Let me know your thoughts.<br>Zantoz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">October, 27</font> You have become better at aggrivation! Im takin a break for a few days.  Zantoz please keep up with themember levels until I get back.  See you all soon,<br>Kanarra Imtiredofalltheazzez

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">October, 20</font> Being that the game is down for the majority of the day I am taking this time to update the page.  Dont freak outwhen you get to the members page and find the images gone.  I had a better thought for charachter images..they will be back up asap.  Meanwhile I need last names forQanya, Zantoz and Kahnn. Cya in game,<br>Kanarra Imanaz

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">October, 18</font> Members levels again are updated. I, Kanarra, have a mailbox full of screenshot and member images to edit.  I have an extra dayoff this week and will spend some time working on those and get them posted.  I would like to thank Zantoz for taking the time to help with this page and for his interestin the guild.  He has brought to me some great ideas for the guild and has rekindled my interest in guild activities. He is truly an asset to the loony bin.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">October, 15</font> Greetings all! I, Zantoz, formally welcome you to the weekend!  Hopefully, I will be able to help support these pages. I'd like to make two suggestions to start and perhaps we can get a dialogue going on these topic. These suggestions are in the message area. Feel free to send me tidbits of information (via email only, please) and I will post them up here.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">October, 13</font> New members are added to the members page, I had a tough time remembering levels, so please correct me ifthey are wrong.  I have screen shots for Qanya and Zantoz, anyone else wanting thier charachter image on the page please send me a screen shot.  Also, you guys areall leveling so fast I cant keep up with who is what level.  If you will take the time to post your current level on the message board I will update those today.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">October, 3</font> Well, you can thank Verant for the news update today!  =)  Xegony crashes while Im on the flat in Mistmooresurrounded by Ancilles.  Cant wait to log in and die! <br> Belated Congrats to Pancho on level 30. <br> Also, be sure to welcome Homeskilet to the guild.  He was a level 4Rouge last I saw him.  Homeskilet is under an evaluation period at this time, please take the time to get to know him and help him if at all possible.<br> A Big Thanksto Maleficus who took Homeskilet under his wing on his first day as a member.  <br> When you see Belee, be sure to offer congrats to her as well, this is the 4th week that she has been level 21.  I dont know of any other member that can fuck around quite as much as she can.  <br> And the Imanidiot award goes to a druid who's name I cant remember (Millian or somthing of the like).Kanarra was at the fairie camp in a small group and was designated puller, the first pull of the evening, as those who know me can imagine, was a really nice train in the making, until the druid pulled a few fairies out of my ass.  After my group extinguished the fairies that were left over, the druid came back to me, thanked me for the train because one of her group members died.  Now, call me an idiot, but that trainwas on my ass, and headed straight for my group...does her group member dying, because SHE pulled fairies off of my train really have to be my fault?

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">September, 29</font> Another quiet week, not much newsworthy going on.  Seems most of us are leveling up nicely andthe levels as of last night have been updated on the members page.  We will miss Dikmer's big mouth in guildchat and of course zone shouts.  For those ofyou not lucky enough to witness this, you're lucky.  My understanding is that he will be around, just not as much as before, we all know chicken farmingtakes lots of time.  Good Luck to you and your family Dikmer, and eat some chicken for me.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">September, 23</font> After two days of camping in Runneye, Kanarra is now the proud owner of that BI Crown.  I leftVeeberg, Epyion and Barupi to brave the depths of Runny and it's unforgiving trains.  I dont know what the final outcome was, however before saying my finalgoodbyes to Runny, the group left with a few BI medallions, Epy and Kan both got a Grotesque mask and in the middle of it all Kan scored a Thulian Claw.  All inall a profitable camping trip.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">September, 22</font> I would like to take this server down time to welcome Barnes and Maleficus.  Neither have been invited to the guild yet, but this will be rectified as soon as possible.  Maleficus is a lvl 11 Druid and I have no idea what Barnes is.  (sorry kidsmy mind is a bit preoccupied, cant remember it all!)  Please be sure to welcome all of our new members.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">September, 20</font> As it seems, I am having trouble staying connected to the game, as are some of the other memberswho share my same isp. I cant help but wonder if it has to do with the storm in the gulf and the nasty weather its creating.  I was in today for a few minutes and my PL was around 35-65%.  Went LD 3 or 4 times in a matter of minutes so I gave up.So, with this, I may not be in game the next couple days til it clears up.<br>I have again, updated the members page and added a couple more faces.  If you want your face on that page, be sure to send me a nice screen shot.  I wontbe chasing you guys down to get them.  Meanwhile, have fun and prepare yourselves for a guild trip to Cazic Thule. 

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">September, 19</font> Again, we would like to welcome a new member, Pancho, aka Pedro, aka DrSnot, aka Addy.  Panchois a 28 lvl Ranger.  Please be sure to welcome him when you see him.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">September, 16</font> Holier Than Thou would like to Welcome our two newest Members.  Fari (24 Cleric)and Bandolmer (8 Pally, I think).  Welcome aboard, we are glad to have you! <br> Also, I would like to offer special thanks to Akitoson, Welor andEndymion for taking up for the little guys in Unrest last night.  To be as brief as possible, Dikmer had a group in the tower camping the knight.I joined the group after his group lost a member and Epyion joined a little later.  A druid named Kallik, a Shaman named Ledoux and a Cleric namedDalthur showed up intending to KS the Knight.  And, as it turned out that is what they did.  But, that was the last one they would KS as Endymion, Akitoson and Welor offered thier assistance.  After many harsh words and quite a verbal display from Welor, the Ksers left the tower.  Im not sure if it was Welor andhis verbal attack, or if it was the mere fact that they knew we had them outpowered.  Needless to say, Score one for the little guys!  

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">September, 15</font> Not alot of excitement this week, but it seems there isnt much sleeping going on.Its time to plan a trip for that ever so dreaded camping.  I know both of my charachters are in need of better armor and Im assuming weall have a wish list a mile long.  Lets get some suggestions and plan a day to Camp.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">September, 9</font> Congrats to all of those who have been leveling.  I updated the levels that I knew as of last night.  I have also added a few screen shots from last nights adventures. I am in need of charachter information for Grraagh soI can add you to the members page.  I am currently workin on more screen shots to get up.  I have alot to work with now.  Keep em coming.  Ohand Epy, your ASS is too big!

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">September, 2</font> Again, we would like to welcome a new member.  Grraagh will be joining the ranks ofHolier Than Thou upon recomendation from Epyion. Welcome Grraagh!<br>I have updated the members page with levels and Vilari's pic.  I have also added another enemy to the list.  Remeber that all the people on this list get the big SNUB when you run across them.  I have added some of the charter.  I am doubtful that this will remain our permanentcharter as I have asked a friend who's writing abilities far surpass mine to handle the charter.  What is there should get the point acrossto any visitors that might happen upon the site before I get the official charter.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">August 30,</font> Holier Than Thou would like to welcome Epyion.  Epyion was inducted as a temporarymember on August 29.  It appears that the officers have all agreed that Epyion is worthy of wearing the Holier Than Thou title beside hisname.  Final decision for full membership now lies in the hands of Epyion as he decides if we are the "right" guild for his interests.  Again, we welcome our newest recruit!

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">August 25,</font> Last night, Kallie and Canar stopped in at the orc camp in west commons.  At lvl9 most of the the orcs in the camp were either white or yellow.  So, Kallie tested out that harmony spell and Canar demonstrated hisability to blow shit up.  We were doing quite well, the experience was flowing smoothly, UNTIL, yup you guessed it, Canar got jumped by another freakin kodiak while low on mana.  About the time of Canar's death I got a tell from Barebe, so while Canar traveled from freeport back to west commons, I went to retrieve Barebe, who is new to the commons area.  Upon returning to the camp there was a ladyhalf elf ranger there, she was in the middle of the camp and had killed everything in sight.  We stood and watched her for a while thinkingthat she would allow us to kill one or two as they came up, being that she was a lvl 16 Ranger and we were only 9's.  She proceeded to killeverything in sight, leaving us and the halfling that had been there twiddling our thumbs.  Getting a little frustrated as we had been therefor quite some time, I sent her a tell explaining that I had a Ranger, that I know how difficult it can be to get money and experience with a Rangerand asked her if it was completely necessary to clean the whole camp.  She sent me back a tell that said she wasnt leaving until she got so many deathfistbelts.  I told her that I wasnt asking her to leave, just to share.  She stated againt that she would leave as soon as she got so many belts.  I told her thatshe could share or I would go get my ranger and we would see who would get all the orcs.  She stated that her and some barbarian dude that had just arrivedwere together and she would like to see me try to get them all.  So, for those of you who know me, this set me right off.  So, Kallie camped and Kanarra who wasin Freeport at the time started her trek to west commons.  Barupi logged in and started his journey from Highpass, Barebe stayed put and Veeberg and Zutar headed overto the orc camp.  Upon my arrival the Barbarian was fighting an orc, I ran directly into the camp, Barupi came in behind me and we proceeded to kill every orcthat spawned.  The Ranger and the Barbarian immediately left.  Now, because the Barb was someone that Veeberg knew from Blackburrow, and half ass explained to Veethat he didnt know what was going on, I will leave his name out.  But the Ranger's name is Veii.  If you see her, dont help her.  Nothing pisses me off more thanto have higher levels act like they are better because they are higher.  Little did this wench know that she was playing ass hole, with the wrong ass hole.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">August 22,</font> I have added a few screen shots, and also added Daidoji's face to the memberspage.  I have received quite a few screen shots, and will get them up as soon as I can.  Thanks for getting them to me.  Barupi gothis pics up first because he sent me the best quality pics.  So the Polaroid award this week goes to Barupi!  =) <br>Also just as a point ofinterest (not to embarass anyone), Dikmer got sqeulched by the Gm yesterday.  Now, although some of us think this was unfair, we are not the "EQ GODS,"  We dont make the rules.  I know first hand how annoying those shouts can be, that is why I have them turned off.  I have not used shouts in a long time.  OOC, can be just as bad, and some comments are probably just best kept to ourselves, no matter how rightwe think we are.  Just because your using OOC doesnt mean that people shouldnt be offended or that they cant read it.  Understand, I amnot saying that we arent right for feeling the way we do about certain things, I am saying that it's not always right to openly state such.  PleasePlease Please, lets not have any more members being squelched.  Dikmer can fill you in on the details if he feels the need.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">August 13,</font> IT'S OFFICIAL.  Holier Than Thou is now an offical guild on Xegony.  Thanksto GM Daegarmo for taking care of me tonight.  Also, I will share with you, the warning she shared with me.  I realize thatwe have a rather..ummm...well..smart ass bunch here.  Please, keep your comments to others clean and ensure that we are notinvolved in anything that would bring shame upon the guild.  Keep foul language out of your chat.  If any are caught behaving in a questionable manner I will be forced to remove you from the guild.  If I do not handle situations correctly Holier Than Thou will be disbanded by the GM.  Now I know this sounds harsh, but I tend to agree with GM Daegarmo on this one.  So, thats my lecture for youas handed down by the EQ Gods.  This guild was created for fun more than anything. Yes we are smart asses and yes we probably arentthe friendliest bunch to walk the lands of Norrath, however we can hold true to our charter (when I get it completed) with out being crudeand without questioning the integrity of our members.<br>For those of you who have not yet been invited to the guild, I will beon at approximately 9pm cst this evening.  You may also search out Belee or Dikmer.  Both of which can recruit but can not assign officerpositions.  Ninia (aka Kaadyen) is a regular member at this point, Kaadyen will receive an officer position later this week.  Any of you maybe recruited and I can assign your positions at a later date if needs be.  I know we are all excited to get that name over our heads.  Have Fun and remember toplay within the guidelines.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">August 12,</font> I have created a form for new recruits to fill out, If we actually getany.  Please stop in and take a look, If I left any questions out I will add them.  I had Tons of Questions when I firststarted making the form, but between kids and phone calls I forgot half of my ideas.  Thanks a bunch, I its amazing how muchcan get done if I take a little time away from the game.  Thats all for today, its time to play a little EQ.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">August 12,</font> Thanks to GM Daegarmo on Xegony, we unfortunately did not make theranks of an official EQ guild last night.  I waited until exactly 9cst (7pst) to page the GM, Immediately followingmy /tell he broadcast that he was going to chat for an hour, 2 and a half hours later no sign of GM Daegarmo.  So, Imsad to say it looks as if we have to wait til Sunday.  I will try again tonight, but odds are I will have to wait.Also, for those on Vallon Zek, they announced last night that all guilds are going to be wiped because of some problemson that server.  They will be reinstating the guild system next wednesday at which time I will petition for our titles.Guess Im off to work now.  =(

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">August 11,</font> Well, today is the day, We become official in less than an hour.  I have been busy editing some picturesthat some of you were so kind to send to me for you charachter image.  I also added what server each charachter plays on as it was requested that we add the Vallon Zek members to the page as well.  Please use either the message board or the email link to send me your level changes.  I will eventually get a form to submit stories, news and levels to make this process a little bit easier.  I need a few more pics for the members page, then I will move on and work on the recruitingpage.  Please get these to me asap as my vacation ends today and I dont know how long my page building motivation will last.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">August 10,</font> I have updated the members page, however I am still in need of Screenshits...err shots from most of you.  I added everyones levels (if they are wrong I am SURE that you will let me know).  I will update levels regularly if youlet me know when you acheive new ones.  I am also adding an email to this site sothat you can get screen shots too me a little bit easier.  Also, some of us have startedcharachters on one of the teams pvp servers.  If you would like those charachters posted here let me know names, class etc etc..  Lastly and most important.  I gotNotification that Holier Than Thou has been approved and I will meet with the GM Tommorow to get our titles.  Those of you playing on VZ let me know if you want guildtitles on that server as well..preferably by 10pm cst tommorow. And a side note..please feel free to correct any and all mispellings/punctuations on the message board.  I am drunkand dont intend to go back and fix any of it.  I got hold of some imported wine while on Vacation.  

<p> <font color="CCCC66" size="+1">July 27,</font> As you might expect I have done very little on the page.  I  am ready now to put a little more time into it and have enlisted the help of Zutar.I am in need of screen shots of every ones faces for the members page..please get with me in game to get my email address so I can finish work on that page.Also, check the message board there is meeting information.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">July 10,</font> Okay so I lied, While I would love to be working on this page I am finding it<br>difficult to tear myself away from the game long enough.  I promise that afterI get double attack I will calm down and put some time into it.

<p><font color="CCCC66" size="+1">June 21,</font> While I would love to be playing Everquest, we are in dire need of a place to gather and shareour astounding intellect. As the game appears to be a gathering place for those of immense stupidity, it has become my first priority to getthis page together as quickly as possible.  Please bear with me for a few more days.</left>
