<left><p>The members of Holier Than Thou are among the elite.  They are quick witted and intelligent.
<p>The purpose of Holier Than Thou is two fold.<br>  The first purpose being a place for like minded individuals to
gather and share thier thoughts and ideas.<br>  The second purpose of Holier Than Thou is to share with all
of Norrath our superior intellect.  Intellect does not necessarily mean that we know everything there is
to know about EQ, however it does mean that we have the capability to find the answers without shouting
stupid questions across a zone or bringing embarassment upon ourselves or our members.  
<p>Those who take the time to get to know us will find that we are not as arrogant as our name suggests.
However, our tolerence for stupidity is minimal and we are often times quick to tell one just how stupid he/she is.
<p>Daily, we look at people and wonder how they make it through life without thier mothers.  These are the people
we are reaching out to, in hopes of teaching them the importance of self dignity.  We are here to point out said stupidity
and hopefully instill a desire to rid themselves of stupidity forever.
