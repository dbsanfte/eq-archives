After travelling the length and breadth of Norrath for quite some time, I came to the conclusion that there was something that frustrated me about the game.  All too often it was necessary to join a specific guild to see a specific content.  If you wanted to see the high end game, you had to join a guild that only permitted lvl 70 toons with 200 AA's, incredible gear and half the flags and keys existing in the game.<p>
But the question then became, "How does one achieve the gear and flags without already being in a guild that can get you there?"  And if you were in a guild that got you that far it was frustrating to have to leave to join a new guild to see other content.  And heaven forbid if you decided to change mains!!!<p>
Often times it stopped being a game and started feeling like work or an obligation.  And that's not the way EQ is supposed to feel.  At least, I can't see it feeling like that.  I understand that if a guild puts a lot of work and effort into getting everyone to a certain point you want to see them stay on.  But I'd rather have someone's loyalty and dedication because they enjoy where they are and are having fun than to have someone be miserable and only showing up to raids because they feel they "have to."<p>
It is my goal to find a compromise that gives players a chance to see the high end without making it feel like work.  I feel this can be done to a great extent by offering the following:<p>
<ul>
<li type=disc>Listing goals, both long and short term, up front and keeping everyone updated on changes and achievements.<p>
<li type=disc>Ensuring rules and expectations are clear, concise and easily accessible by all.<p>
<li type=disc>Showing everyone the same level of respect no matter what their place within the guild.<p>
<li type=disc>Acknowledging that everyone can contribute to our ongoing success both in abilities and ideas.<p>
<li type=disc>Being unbiased in all decisions and accepting that upholding the rules and views of the guild cannot be based on personal views of an individual.<p>
<li type=disc>Accepting that to achieve the goals of the guild at times means doing things that are less enjoyable to a few or even the majority.<p></ul>
It is my belief that if these few items are adhered to without sway, a guild can reach a level of play and enjoyment that is rare in these days.  It is my hope that everyone that comes to the Order will find that we are constantly holding true to the course.  And it is my belief that this will create such a sense of brotherhood and a desire to see the guild as a whole succeed that loyalty will ring true.<p>
With this being said, I welcome you to the Order of Eternal Flame.  I hope to see you remain with us in the years to come.  And I pray that we all work together to stay true to ourselves and the Order til the day Sony decides to turn off the lights and lock the door behind them.<p>
I salute you and thank you for making this guild your home.  May your days be long with us.<p>
Respectfully Yours,<p>
Ekonnahn Bladeripper</br>
