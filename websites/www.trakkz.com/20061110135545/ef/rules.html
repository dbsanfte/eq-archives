Unless specifically stated, these rules are to be adhered to by everyone.  None are above the rules stated below, regardless of rank, level or class.  Any change to the rules will be immediately updated here with an announcement in the Guild MotD and on the forums.  Questionable matters will be handled on a case by case basis with updates posted immediately after the issue is resolved.
<p>
Warnings will be given for first rule infractions.  After that, it will be at the discretion of the Guild Officers / Leaders as to issue further warnings, punishments or removal from the guild.  The only person authorized to restore someone to the guild after removal is the Guild Leader and will not be done until after a thorough review of the situation that led to removal.
<p>
Punishments can include, but are not limited to, suspension from raids, suspension from bidding on or the receiving of loot or penalties to DKP.  The officers and guild leader will do their best to make the punishment fit the crime.  If you feel you were unjustly punished, you may contact the guild leader once on the matter.  After final determination is made you are expected to adhere to the decision.  No further questioning should ensue and pressing the issue can result in further penalties.

These rules concern the inner workings of the Order.  They only pertain to the membership of the Order and are not able to be upheld outside the guild.<p>
<ul>
<li type=disc>Above all else let respect and common courtesy be your guide.  We are a brotherhood with common goals.  It should be our desire and intent to treat others as we ourselves would wish to be treated.<p>
<li type=disc>Language of a mature sort is to be tolerated.  However, it should not be used in excess.<p>
<li type=disc>There is a difference between disagreements and arguments.  If you have a disagreement in guild chat that starts to escalate towards an argument, take it to tells.  If it concerns more than one person, take it to a private chat channel.<p>
<li type=disc>Begging in guild chat or OOC of any sort will not be tolerated.  It is one thing to ask a favor of someone, such as lending plat to summon your corpse or if anyone can do a combine for you.  Requests for power levelling, plat to buy a bazaar item, etc will be met with severe punishment.  If you want to ask someone in tells, do so only once and accept an answer of "No" the first time it's given.
</ul>

<br><font size=1 face="Arial"><A HREF="#guild">Guild</A> / <A HREF="#raid">Raiding</A> / <A HREF="#dkp">DKP</A> / <A HREF="#server">Server</A> / <A HREF="#app">Applying</A> / <A HREF="#top">Back to the Top</A><font size=3></center><p>
Our goal is to become a raiding guild.  While some factors of the guild will change once we begin raiding, the values and standards we began with in this guild are not to falter just because of a change in content.<p>
<ul>
<li type=disc>If a raid is called to form at a scheduled raid time, you are expected to attend if online.  Off time raids are at player discretion.  The only exceptions for raid attendance are lack of an expansion or RL issues.  If it is determined that you are missing raids deliberately without a valid reason, guild removal is possible.<p>
<li type=disc>Alts are only to participate in raids when requested by an officer to do so.  Boxed Toons (a.k.a. Bots) are permitted if the raid has room and performance of your main will not be severely hindered.<p>
<li type=disc>If you are boxing a toon at a raid and are asked to remove it from the raid, you are to do so without question.  Your boxed toon will receive  DKP for the portion participated in.<p>
<li type=disc>If you are asked to return to your main from an alt, you are to do so without question.  Your alt will receive DKP for the portion participated in.<p>
<li type=disc>Only one Boxed Toon (Bot) will be permitted to raid per main unless extenuating circumstances arise.
</ul>

<center><a name="dkp">DKP / Loot Rules</a>
<br><font size=1 face="Arial"><A HREF="#guild">Guild</A> / <A HREF="#raid">Raiding</A> / <A HREF="#dkp">DKP</A> / <A HREF="#server">Server</A> / <A HREF="#app">Applying</A> / <A HREF="#top">Back to the Top</A><font size=3></center><p>
Dragon Kill Points (DKP) are points awarded for events and successes, both raid related and personal.  These are also refered to Raid Points.  They are then used for acquiring items dropped during raids or certain items stored in the guild bank.<p>
<ul>
<li type=disc>DKP will be awarded for all events held during regularly scheduled raid events.  DKP for off-hour events will be on a case by case basis as determined by an officer.<p>
<li type=disc>The Order will use a bidding system for loot dropped during raids for items that can be used by more than one class.  At no time will members be permitted to spend more DKP than they currently have on account.<p>
<li type=disc>Items that drop at raids that are usable by only one class will be offered for 10 DKP on a seniority basis.  The senior-most member of that class will have first rights to purchase the item for 10 DKP.  If that mbr declines, it will be offered to the next senior-most person and so on.  If none desire to purchase the item for 10 DKP, it will then be offered to Apps.  If no app of that class desires it, or if none are available, the item will either go to guild tribute if possible or will be destroyed.  The item will not go to a "First come First served" status. This is to keep classes from plotting to pass on the item with intent for all to get it for free.<p>
<li type=disc>Open raids and off-schedule raids will use a random roll method to distribute loot.  Only valid classes will be permitted to submit their name for the roll unless no one present of those classes wants the item.<p>
<li type=disc>Spell Runes will always use a random roll method.<p>
<li type=disc>Boxed Toons (Bots) will receive 50% of the DKP that would have been awarded to a main.
</ul>

<center><a name="server">Conduct with others of Bristlebane</a>
<br><font size=1 face="Arial"><A HREF="#guild">Guild</A> / <A HREF="#raid">Raiding</A> / <A HREF="#dkp">DKP</A> / <A HREF="#server">Server</A> / <A HREF="#app">Applying</A> / <A HREF="#top">Back to the Top</A><font size=3></center><p>
While you are expected to uphold the guild above others, we still have standards of conduct when interacting with those not of the guild.  We expect these to be adhered to in all dealings with those outside the guild.<p>
<ul>
<li type=disc>Again, let respect and common courtesy be your motto in all that you do.  Treat others on the server with the respect due every human being.  There is a person behind each toon.<p>
<li type=disc>There is to be no bashing of other guilds.  Even if they do us wrong, jumping our targets or bad-mouthing us, we will stick to the high road.  This holds true for guild chat, ooc, shouts and/or tells.<p>
<li type=disc>The rules set forth by Sony for the playing of EQ will be upheld.  This includes the Play Nice Policies (PNP).  That means deliberate training and/or kill stealing will not be tolerated.
</ul>

<center><a name="app">Applying to Order of Eternal Flame</a>
<br><font size=1 face="Arial"><A HREF="#guild">Guild</A> / <A HREF="#raid">Raiding</A> / <A HREF="#dkp">DKP</A> / <A HREF="#server">Server</A> / <A HREF="#app">Applying</A> / <A HREF="#top">Back to the Top</A><font size=3></center><p>
At this current time, the guild is open to all classes and levels.
<ul>
<li type=disc>It is understood that upon applying to OEF you have read and understand the rules.  You are expected, upon accepting an invite to the guild, to adhere to all rules set forth for the guild.<p>
<li type=disc>There is a two week probation period upon getting your OEF tag.  During this app period, you are expected to attend any scheduled raid event possible.  You will not, however, earn any DKP during the app period.<p>
<li type=disc>You are encouraged to join any guild group possible.  Guild members are encouraged to invite apps to group with them.  This gives everyone a chance to get to know each other and see how well everyone works together.<p>
<li type=disc>Apps must register with the forums.  They will only be able to access the public area during their probation period.  Upon receiving full membership status, they will be able to access the mbr areas of the forums.<p>
<li type=disc>Apps are not able to request items from the guild bank and may only withdraw public items.  Abuse of the guild bank is reason to have your application refused and immediate guild removal.<p>

</ul>

If you have any questions, feel free to contact an officer and they will be glad to assist in clarifying any of the above points.
