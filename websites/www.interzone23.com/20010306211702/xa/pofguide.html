<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I have only one point to make here, and will be brief to stress it:  learn the rules of Fearplane.  
If you break a rule, YOU will cause the death of the entire party.  YOU can potentially turn a 
successful raid into a ten hour corpse retrieval.  YOU are not an asset, but a liability to the 
entire raid if you go into Fear without learning the rules.  Education can make you useful.  Please 
take the time to learn some key points in this guide.  Not only will they save your life, but they 
will drastically increase the chances at having a successful raid.  Having said that, we can proceed 
to the Plane and how to get in successfully.

<p>To begin, you must be level 46 or higher to enter this zone, but you should probably be a couple of 
bubbles into 46 before you come because you're going to lose a lot of that XP, just accept that now.  
All of the MOBs in Fear can hit in the 130+ range and range from levels in the high 40s to low 50s.  
They have an abnormally high aggro radius and sometimes aggro from out of sight.  For the most part 
they drop class specific no drop armor, all of it no drop.

<A NAME="02">

<h3>The MOBs</h3>

<p>First, let's look at the MOBs that drop your armor.

<p><b>Amygdalan Knights</b> - The Amygdalan Knight is a Shadowknight as the name implies.  They come 
complete with useless (although annoying) pets.  They drop Umbral Platemail armor (Shadowknight only).  
Their special skills are Harm Touch and Mana Drain.  These can usually be seen guarding the temples of 
Fright, Dread, and Terror.

<p><b>Fetid Fiends (Male)</b> - Resembles a huge zombie.  They drop Valorium armor (Paladin only).  
Their special skill is Disease.

<p><b>Gorgons</b> - Gorgons resemble Harpies from Steamfont Mountains but with snakes coming out 
of their heads.  Gorgons drop Vermiculated armor (Druid only).  Their special skill is a 15 second 
stun which can get pretty nasty if there's a couple of them on you so having a high magic resistance 
for these things is pretty essential.

<p><b>Tentacle Tormentors</b> - Tormentors resemble their weaker cousins from Unrest and Najena.  
Chain stunning these guys is a good idea - it keeps them from using their special skills.  They drop 
Thorny Vine armor (Ranger only) as well as a druid based belt.  Their special skills are Lifetap, 
Throwback, and an area affect debuf.  Like the Glare Lords (see below), they're going to wipe out a 
lot of your buffs which kind of sucks.  Their knockback is quite nasty as well.  If you're fighting 
them with a camp against a zone wall, fight them with your backs to the zone wall so that if you get 
knocked back, you don't go far and can return to the fight quickly.  

<p><b>Shiverbacks</b> - Looks like a big ape from Cazic Thule but hits hard and fast.  They drop 
Shiverback armor (Monk only).  They have no special skills.

<p><b>Frightfingers</b> - Resembles a very small Reanimated Hand from Lower Guk or Unrest.  They drop 
Carmine armor (Wizard only).  Their special skill is wizard spells, which they cast a lot of.

<p><b>Boogeymen</b> - Resembles a huge Ghoul.  They drop Blighted armor (Necromancer only).  Their 
special skill is Ghoulroot.

<p><b>Spinechiller Spiders</b> - Spiders are always fun.  They drop Cryosilk armor (caster based so it 
can be worn by wizards, enchanters, necromancers, and magicians).  Their special skill is a relatively 
tame cold based DoT spell that hits for 300 in 30 ticks.

<p><b>Phoboplasms</b> - Often called "jello", these resemble gelatinous cubes from Splitpaw of old, 
Runnyeye, or the Qeynos Aqueducts.  They are located in the temple of Cazic Thule.  Jello are loved 
by all because they can randomly drop any piece of planar armor in the game, including armor for 
classes such as rogues, bards, clerics, and warriors which is normally found in the Plane of Hate.  
There are conflicting reports as to whether jello can truly drop ANY piece or just 1 piece from each 
class (i.e. Cleric Boots, Bard Bracer, Paladin Bracer, Warrior Gauntlets, etc.).  Their special skill 
is an area effect debuff, but whereas the Glare Lords and Tentacle Tormentors debuff four buffs at a 
time, these only debuff 1 buff at a time.

<p>The rest of these MOBs drop stuff other than class specific no drop armor.

<p><b>Amygdalan Warriors</b> - The Amygdalan Warrior is just a Knight without the ability to harm touch 
or make a pet.  This means they still mana sink and because they're warriors, they have a much higher 
magic resistance than most things in the zone.  They are extremely common in the zone and you'll be 
fighting an awful lot of these.  They drop a warrior only shield and whip.  A lot of these are either 
found wandering the zone or protecting the main temple of Cazic Thule.

<p><b>Fetid Fiends (Female)</b> - Resembles a huge Tormented Dead (those female zombies from Unrest).  
They drop a girdle that's quite good for Clerics.  They have no special skills.

<p><b>Turmoil Toads</b> - Resemble small Froglock ghouls that can be found in Najena or Lower Guk. 
Toads drop Turmoil Warts and a belt for Shamans.  Their special skill used to be Ghoulroot, but 
recently this has changed to Fear.  This is why you want to have SoW and Run OFF when attacking these 
guys.  If they fear you and you start to run away from them quickly, you could run far enough to start 
aggroing other stuff.

<p><b>Glare Lords</b> - Resembles a small version of an evil eye.  Glare Lords are enchanters, 
although I have never seen one charm anyone.  They come with Enchanter pets and drop wands for Mages 
and Enchanters.  Their special skill is an area effect debuff which is quite nasty.  You could fight 
just one of these things and find ten buffs are gone by the end of the fight.

<p><b>Scarelings</b> - These little critters look like little imps from Solsek B Efreeti area 
or Kindle in Solsek A.  They are rogues and backstab for 400+.  These are VERY deadly and always 
the first target when one is in the camp.  Another deadly tactic of the Scareling is to teleport 
anyone to a random location (not too far away) potentially starting a massive train leading to 
a total wipe out of the raiding party.  This is pretty much why they're given the highest priority.  
They're also very hard to target and see because of their size.  They also run faster than SoW so 
kiting them is pretty hard.  Repeat, Scarelings must die, and die fast.  Scarelings drop a rogue-only 
rapier.  Their special skill is Backstab and Teleport.

<p><b>Phantasms</b> - Phantasms resemble spectres.  The drop nothing of note and have no special skills.

<p><b>Worry Wraiths</b> - Looks like a giant will-o-wisp with a pet.  If these are not dispelled, 
they have a damage shield that can cause many people to go linkdead from the amount of "Billy 
was burned" messaages.  They drop nothing of note and have no special skills.

<p><b>Samhains</b> - Resembles a jack-o-lantern from the yard of Unrest or a scarecrow from the 
farms in West Karana.  These drop a ranger only axe.  They have no special skills.

<p><b>Nightmares</b> - Looks like a big black horse but squeaks like a rusty swingset.  They drop a 
cloak which is pretty much crap on a stick.  Their special skill is Blind and have been known to 
Fear as well.

<p><b>Dracoliche</b> - This looks like a huge Ashenbone Drake from Plane of Hate.  If you have 
never seen one of those, you have never seen anything that looks like a Dracoliche.  All I can 
say is that it looks like Vox or Nagafen died, decomposed, then returned to life with just its 
bones.  This is Cazic Thule’s number one guardian.  This bone dragon is a shadowknight with a pet. 
Attacking the Dracoliche always aggros Cazic himself, and throughout the battle with Draco, 
Cazic will be death-touching constantly, as well as sending in reinforcements.  He has a mean 
disease based DOT and dragon roar (area effect Fear). Leave it to Verant to make a bone dragon, 
call it a liche, and NOT make it undead.  That's right, absolutely no undead attack spells work on 
Draco.  After the Draco fight, everyone will have to log out, wait 3 minutes and log back in unless 
other specified by the raid leader.  Draco spawns once a week (real time).  It's special skills are 
a DoT and dragon roar.

<p><b>Fright, Dread, and Terror</b> - These are Cazic Thule’s little buddies that have temples 
located around the zone.  They are large versions of the three golems from Cazic Thule.  Fighting any 
one of these will also aggro Cazic.  They drop nothing but some spare change.  Their special skill 
is usually Blind.

<p><b>Cazic Thule</b> - Cazic is a God.  Cazic is a vengeful God.  Cazic does not like people.  
Cazic does not like you.  In general, he is a level 55 MOB that has several irritating quirks. 
First, he hits for 400 and double attacks.  Second, he uses gravity flux like it is going out 
of style.  Every time you are fluxed, it removes one buff (put JBoots in top buff slot and reactivate 
after every flux).  Third, Cazic has pets.  Not a typo, plural pets, and they are fairly irritating, 
although nothing to lose sleep over.  His special skills are Gravity Flux, phat melee skillz, and 
debuffing mojo.

<p>Last, but not lEast, the most fearsome of all of the enemies in Fearplane...

<p><b>Someone who does not follow the Fearplane rules</b> - This enemy is in your ranks.  He 
could even be grouped with you.  This enemy is fearsome because of its ability to kill 50+ 
people within 3 minutes.  Their special skills are Train Making.

<A NAME="03">

<h3>Raid Requirements</h3> 

<p>First off, the raid should never exceed 7 full groups.  The lag in a fully populated fearplane 
is incredible, and increases exponentially with over 42 people.  If there are more people that 
want to go, there is ample opportunity for them to support the troops outside the portal. 

<p><b>Tanks (and a lot of them)</b> - Tanks in the raid need to get out their old armor class 
gear and dust it off.  On the initial attempt, armor class is key.  MOBs in there hit for 130+, 
as stated previously, and the more hits you can take, the longer you can stay alive to support 
the casters.

<p><b>Monks (at lEast two)</b> - You need to have monks in at the zone in point or you're never 
going to break this place.  Two monks feigned on either side of the zone in portal will be able to 
relay information back to the raid on when the safest time is to zone in.  If you can't get monks 
to do it, the onus will fall on necros to do the job.

<p><b>Clerics</b> - Each group going in really needs to have at lEast one cleric.  Druids and 
Shamans do not substitute in this instance.  They will be very occupied in other capacities 
inside such as charming and blasting.  You need a devoted healer that has only one objective: 
Keep everyone alive as long as possible.  Finding clerics for fear raids is rough, but you really 
have to make it a major priority.  Raids have survived with one cleric, but not for long.

<p><b>Druids and Shamans</b> - Druids are essential for the raiding party.  They can charm 
animal MOBs that enter the camp without invitation, turning a foe into a nice level 50 pet. 
Shamans can Togor MOBs and drastically reduce the amount of damage dealt by them, as well as 
Malosi them to allow the casters to work more effectively.

<p><b>Necromancers</b> - Necros perform a dual role in a break.  First of all, the break involves 
having some key positions occupied by characters that are feigned; Second, necros can charm the 
undead MOBs that enter the camp without warning, again turning a foe into a very nice pet. 

<p><b>Enchanters</b> - Enchaters are the king of the debuffs, and this just may tip the scales in 
your favor, allowing you to eliminate a few MOBs.  They can also mezmerize MOBs that enter the 
camp that cannot be charmed by either necros or druids (ie. Scarelings and Amys).  Clarity may 
also make the difference by allowing that one extra blast, or that one extra heal.  Some battles 
last upwards of 10 minutes, and clarity is very effective in these circumstances. 

<p><b>Magicians</b> - Every raid needs a magician. After the initial rush, the melee types wont 
have gear any more. They will need many things summoned including food, water and weapons. The 
mage is a key component of the raid. 

<A NAME="04">

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<p>1. All tanks need to be bound in Ogguk at the entrance.  If the raid has rangers, the rangers 
can spirit of wolf the people that arrive in Ogguk after they are killed inside.  If there are no 
rangers on the raid (although highly unlikely), at lEast one druid or shaman needs to bind in 
Ogguk also to SoW the newly dead troops to get past the bouncers outside.  Also, someone that 
can cast ultravision or infravision is needed, as Feerott is a dark place already, and the humans 
and erudites that need to get back to the portal cant see anything at all.

<p>2. All casters that can bind, do so by the rock right outside of the portal.  That area is 
void of wandering skeletons that always seem to show up right when you respawn back outside.

<p>3. Cyndereela:  She is the necro that guards the portal into Fear.  Ideally, a group of people 
may be camping her for experience.  If not, designate a few people to kill her when she spawns. 
She is dangerous only because she can see invisible, and will attack people zoning in, thereby 
rendering them visible.  Being visible when entering the Plane of Fear = BAD.

<p>4. Buffs:  Every party must be composed of tanks and at lEast one cleric, and ideally, 
one druid.  On the initial rush, the buffs are as follows:

<p><li><b>Tanks</b>: Clerical Reso/Shield/Symbol, Shamanic Talismans, Stamina, Levitate (or Dead Man 
Floating), See Invis, and finally Invis.  Some people will tell you Superior Camo is just as effective 
as Invis but many people just don't believe it.  Strength and Agility are also nice, as is Dexterity 
for tanks with weapons that proc.
<li><b>Priests/Casters</b>: All of the above buffs except strength and dexterity. They can get clarity 
instead. 

<p>This is where some of the extra people can come in to the picture.  If there are more than 
42 people, the extra people can stand outside the portal and hold gems for symbols and shield 
skin, food and water, etc. for the troops that will be back shortly naked.  Extra people can 
also be buffers.  All of the buffs take time and mana away from the people going inside.  Extra 
people outside to aid in the buffing can be very helpful. 

<p>5. Feign Death:  At lEast 2 people are going to need to get inside and feign death in 2 key 
locations.  The first person will go inside and feign death right at the portal.  This person is 
responsible for letting the people on the outside know when the portal area is clear of 
wandering MOBs.  When the portal area is clear, and there is a safe route to the West camp, the 
second person will enter and proceed to the West camp and feign there.  This person serves a 
dual purpose.  First, they notify the raiders when the camp is clear.  Second, they serve as a 
beacon to let the raiders know where to go upon entering the Plane.  Therefore the second person 
who feigns must know exactly where the camp needs to be established.

<p>6. The Gathering:  When everyone is buffed and the two inside are in place safely, everyone 
must gather in front of the portal and await the charge command. The raid leader must designate 
the order of the groups to enter, and groups will enter 10 seconds apart. At this point, it is 
very important to be camouflaged at all times as the charge command can come at any time. 

<p>7. The assist hotkey:  The raid leader will announce who the main and secondary tanks are. 
You may have been in situations before when you said to yourself "I don’t need to make an 
assist key, I can see what they are attacking and hit it."  This is not one of those times.  You 
MUST make your assist hotkey for the tanks.  If you don’t know how to make a hotkey, for the 
love of Mithanial Marr, ask someone.

<A NAME="05">

<h3>The First Rush</h3>

<p>1. YOU WILL DIE!! This point cannot be stressed enough. Do not think that by using some 
sneaky tactic or superior knowledge you can survive.  This mentality only hurts the group and 
causes the raid to fail.  Go in there KNOWING that you are about to emerge naked at your bind 
point.  That being said, go in there DETERMINED to live as long as possible and kill as much 
as you can. 

<p>2. When the people inside give the go-ahead, you must act fast.  Group 1 (ideally the strongest 
group) zones into fear, takes a 90 degree turn left, runs down the hill to the wall where the 
person is feigned.  After group 1, group 2 goes in 10 seconds later and heads to the camp, repeat 
the process with all groups.  This is where the raid can succeed or fail.  The first minute can 
determine the success of the raid, as the two most important rules apply here. They are: 

<p>A. If you are attacked outside of camp, STAND AND DIE!!! In case someone missed that, let me 
rephrase it.  STOP MOVING, DO NOT RUN TO CAMP, DO NOT RUN AWAY FROM CAMP, DO NOT RUN ANYWHERE!!! 
If ONE single person disregards this rule, the raid is a failure.  I am not being overly ramatic, 
this is fact. If you run, two things can happen.  If you run TO the camp, you bring a nice train 
of MOBs with you. Because of the increased aggro range, you WILL bring a train.  When this 
happens, everyone will die, including you.  You might even lose your corpse.  For this reason, it 
is in YOUR best interest to stand and die, thereby increasing the chances of the success of the 
raid.  If you run AWAY from camp, a phenomenon called chain-aggro happens and MOBs crawl out 
from under rocks and behind trees and get all stirred up, resulting in a mass of wandering 
MOBs. This will also get everyone killed.  To reiterate, DO NOT RUN ANYWHERE - STAND AND DIE.  
If it makes you feel better, turn away from the computer while you die. 

<p>B. Second cardinal rule - STAY TOGETHER IN CAMP.  Do not wander even 5 steps away from 
everyone else.  You need to get into a tight little ball with your friends.  I don’t care if 
they smell. 

<p>3. At this time, hopefully everyone has followed the above rules, and everyone is huddled 
in the camp, waiting for the onslaught. When the first wanderer comes by, it will aggro, and 
can aggro from near the portal. If you can see it, it could be in camp within 10 seconds. If 
you cant see it, it can be in camp in 10.6 seconds. When the first MOB enters the camp, the 
main tank will acquire the target, attack, and call for assist. Everyone attack the same MOB. 
EVERYONE. Blasters blast, tanks tank, clerics heal, shamans togor and malosi, enchanters 
tashani.
 
<p>4. ADDs: If you are killing a MOB and see another come into the camp, shout ADD to ensure 
that everyone knows there are more MOBs.  If the tank then chooses a new target, he will shout 
and you have to assist again to acquire the new target.  For instance, if you are fighting a 
Shiverback, and a Scareling wanders into camp, the main tank will most likely switch to the 
Scareling, unless the ape is almost dead.  The main tank will decide what the proper target is, 
and you need to follow the lead tank.  Do not attempt to kite adds at this point. 

<p>5. Teleports: As mentioned earlier, Scarelings can teleport you away from the camp.  If this 
happens, regain you bearings, get the camp in sight, and then look around.  Make 110% sure you 
have not aggroed any more MOBs.  If you have been aggroed, STAND AND DIE.  Do not run back to 
camp, as this will result in another train. 

<p>6. Death:  Eventually the clerics will run out of mana.  The blasters will be out also.  The 
tanks will start dropping one by one.  Fight to the death.  Every MOB killed on the initial break 
is a huge accomplishment.  If you can get 4-5 MOBs dead on the first rush, consider yourself in. 
Might take a few more deaths, but you can get in.  Another tactic that is also popular is to make 
sure you have two groups fighting at your first break camp with an evac druid in each group.  You 
fight off as much stuff as you can until you know it can't go much further, then evac.  This way 
you save the groups without having to do CR.  Then you just buff up again outside, re-enter the gate 
(this time with less MOBs at the entrance) and repeat the cycle, evacing again if necessary.

<A NAME="06">

<h3>Subsequent Rushes</h3>

<p>1. So you died.  You land in either Ogguk or right outside the portal.  If you land in Ogguk, 
get a SoW and get back to the portal.  DO NOT ZONE IN.  Before training the spectres to the 
portal, might be a nifty idea to be sure there and people there to derail the train. 

<p>2. Get summoned:  Get the mage to start summoning swords and food and water.  About 5 food and 
water per person is fine, and either sword or modulating rod for a weapon.  Sit down and start 
getting buffs together for the second try.

<p>3. Basically the same as the initial rush, when called in, proceed in an orderly fashion to 
the camp and get in a ball.  Again, if you are attacked on the way, STAND AND DIE. 

<p>4. Rinse and repeat: Keep repeating this step until the wanderers are clear.  Conflicting 
reports, but I think there are 12 wanderers that need to be dispatched. 

<A NAME="07">

<h3>Establishing the West Camp</h3> 

<p>Not really much to be said here, except that you must still follow the main 2 rules.  This 
is not a time for exploration.  You have killed the wanderers in the area, and your camp is 
relatively safe.  If you wander, you WILL train, and trust me, there are still enough MOBs in 
the zone to kill every level 46 - 50 person on the server at once.  Wanders basically consist 
of scarelings, shiverbacks, fetid fiends, spinechiller spiders, worry wraiths, and turmoil toads. 
The scarelings and undead MOBs can see invis and the scarelings have the largest aggro range.

<p>There are some people that will say a better camp area is the North Wall near the North West 
corner of the zone.  It's a great idea in theory and it has its advantages but a lot of down sides 
as well.  On the good side, if you can get people to the North wall, it's a safer spot, with 
no roamers most of the time.  The down side is that you have to run through an entirely spawned 
zone to get there, which kind of sucks.  Keep in mind that some of the stuff you're running through 
can't see through invis (like Tentacle Tormentors) but once something else sees you, you're toast.  
There is a high chance you will run into something else.  There's also a theory that says people 
could camp out there in an empty zone and come back the next day when everything is spawned.  That's 
a nice idea, but if you log on the next day and the clerics die during your raid, who's going to res 
the people? Now you're going to have to get somebody to the North wall from the gate (which is 
probably not clear) and you won't have a choice in the matter.

<p>Yes, the West Wall isn't the easiest, but it's generally considered the best for CR and if you've 
ever sat through a ten hour CR session in fear, you know how important it is to make the corpses 
easily accessible.

<p>Once the initial camp has been set up and you have some breathing space to work with, using 
Snare and Fear on MOBs can save people a lot of strife.

<A NAME="08">

<h3>Cazic Thule Says Your Name</h3>

<p>When you see this, it means that Cazic Thule is kind of annoyed with the entire concept of 
people "raiding" his plane, and he decided to take matters into his own hands.  If the person 
who gets the death touch was in the West camp at that time, Cazic Thule now is aggro on the 
entire camp and will begin to death touch someone every 30 seconds or so.  When this happens, 
you will have to do one of two things: 

<p>If you are fighting something, kill it and kill it fast.  After that, watch for the raid 
leader to call the CAMP command.  When you see this, sit and camp, and pray you save your ass. 
Leave the game for 3 minutes, then return to the game.  This will clear the Cazic aggro on the 
party.  If you are not fighting, just look for the camp command.  Do not camp until requested to 
do so.  The leader makes that decision, and you will look like a cowardly fool if you camp out 
with no command only to find that the person that caught the death touch was not in the camp. 
Save some embarrassment and wait for the signal. 

<A NAME="09">

<h3>Clearing the Zone</h3> 

<p>Basically this just consists of the pull team going out and grabbing MOBs and dragging them 
back to the camp for a slaughter.  Do not go after MOBs, let them come to you.  If you see the 
puller run by with a huge train, do not attack the train.  Let the pull team pick them off of 
the train one-by-one and take them to the camp.  I repeat, do NOT attack the train. 

<A NAME="10">

<h3>General Strategy on Pulling In Fear</h3> 

<p>As a puller, have a lot of magic resistance.  The more the better but you'll have pretty good luck 
pulling with about 75 MR.  If you can get an enchanter in your group to cast Group Resist Magic, 
that would be best.  The main reason why this is important is because of the stuns from Gorgons, harm 
touches from Knights, and fears from Toads while pulling.  All of these things can kill you fast if 
you're not paying attention.

<p>Always prepare to die a lot.  Just expect it to happen.  If you can't take a death with a 
ressurection, just don't volunteer to pull.  Especially if you've not been up there much.  Your XP 
will fall down because most likely your pulling group won't be getting XP, just learn to live with it.

<p>If you think you have SUPER aggro on you and you better quit out while feigned, do it.  Trust me, 
any experienced group of people won't complain about the 3 minutes that they have to wait while you're
gone.  When you feign pull and split off widely wandering MOBs, they might wander back near other MOBs, 
and when you stand up, they will ALL come.  In the worst case, a MOB may be near CT and when you 
stand up you will get death touched.  So reiterating again, if you think you are in big trouble, play 
it safe and /q while feigned.  There's no reason to take such a large risk.

<p>If you have a monk in the group that is 51+ tell him/her to pull instead of anyone lower because
stonestance will save sooooo many deaths that it's not even funny.  A monk that is 50- will die so 
many more times.  The moments that stonestance count the most is when your feign fails and you have 5
boogeys hitting you while you're standing there hoping for another chance to feign.

<p>Glare lords and Worry Wraiths are casters and they can be a complete pain in the butt.  Sometimes 
you don't even know that they're casting so you feign at the wrong time and they will break your feign 
and you will die.  That's a fact of life.  One way to help prevent this from happening is to always 
turn around and look back at the MOBs before you feign to the ground, so that you can sorta get a 
visual on what's going to happen.  If you see a glare lord chasing you and then it suddenly stops, 
that means it's casting something so don't feign until you get hit with a spell.

<p>Although it's nice to turn off spell effects when in the planes to reduce lag, as a puller DON'T 
do that.  You will have problems pulling caster MOBs and you won't be able to have good judgement 
when feigning. Keep it on the "low" setting.

<p>Don't ever let anyone in your group cast a spell on you no matter what unless you specifically 
tell them when and what spell.  If you are feigned and someone casts a beneficial spell on you, it's 
fine.  If you stand up with aggro and someone in the group casts a spell on you (heal, buff, see 
invis), you are all in deep trouble.  IF you see this happen, figure out who casted on you FAST and 
tell them to run AWAY from the group and start camping out. If he is lucky he will camp out in time 
and live.  If that person stays with the group, prepare to fight a train of MOBs.  If he is unlucky 
a horde of MOBs will kill him, but at lEast 30 people don't have to die.

<p>If you ever fight Amy Knights, sometimes you will have to check loot after they are dead and log 
out, because they aggro Cazic himself about half the time.

<p>If Cazic is not up, the zone is much easier to pull.  If you ever aggro Dracoliche when you didn't
want to, quit out.  He's not fun to toy with.

<p>Always kill all the wanderers that you can see before you move the party anywhere.  Sometimes it 
pays a lot to just stand in an open area and wait a couple minutes to see if wanderers come by.  If 
they don't, then you can think about moving the party up a little to make the pulls easier on yourself.

<p>Don't ever get too confident and move the group too quickly.  You will be surprised by how many 
wanderers come by.  If your group is doing so well that it seems they want more MOBs than you can 
pull, try bringing 2 or 3 at a time.  If you have good enchanters it shouldn't be a big problem.

<p>Never ever train your group.  Ressing you is 30 times faster than ressing everyone.  Don't ever 
go near your group standing unless you are absolutely positive that you have no aggro.  For example 
if you just got back from quitting out, it's probably safe to go back, get grouped again and get a 
couple buffs you might be missing.  Otherwise don't do it because it's just risky and there's no 
reason to.  Stay feigned for most of your time, it's just a safer bet.

<p>Always chain pull if possible.  It's safer and faster than trying to split MOBs.  Anyone who has 
pulled the scareling tower will agree with me here.

<p>After you have pulled something, you need to get about halfway to the party and hit the MOB a 
couple times while you test to see what else you have aggroed. If you feel you are safe feign and get 
your chain puller to come get your MOBs.

<p>Use third person views often to check what stuff is aggro on you while you're feigned BEFORE you 
tell your chainer to come get them.

<p>When you are the main puller, group with the event leader, an enchanter and a cleric to heal.  The 
enchanter does not have to be the main enchanter because that would give the cleric too much work to 
do.

<p>Always tell your event leader that you are looking for a pull before you go out for more, and 
don't ever ever pull anything just because someone requests it in a tell.  Don't play favoritism, 
always do what you feel is most comfortable.  In fact, people that keep shouting in /shout and /ooc to 
pull certain MOBs should be told to STFU.

<p>If you are the puller or chain puller, make sure you have something that gives you infra or 
ultra vision, like the ring from the High Priest is Sol A.  Something that does not poof when you 
camp or /q.  The ring (Glowing Stone Band) is not that hard to get, and is campable in one evening.

<h3>MOB Pull Order in Fear</h3>

<p>This assumes you are breaking from the South West corner.

<p>Once everyone is rezzed/buffed/ready, stay there for about 15-30 minutes killing any wanderers 
that come nearby.  Once you feel that most of the wanderers have died, start looking around the 
portal area for any wanderers.  Bring those back to the group and kill them.

<p>Please remember that if at any time you see wanderers on the way to pull, bring those back to 
the group to kill off first before you go out again.

<p>Then pull the fetid fiend house to the North.  After that is cleared, go a little more North to 
find any other wanderers.

<p>Then pull to the East along the South wall.  You will see a couple towers and a house.  In these, 
there are samhains, boogeymen, and scarelings.  These are statics spawns along with a bunch of 
wanderers that will be there.  You should probably chain pull this area, but make sure that when you 
feign you are still kinda far from the group, because otherwise they might see your group and train.

<p>Once this area is done, go past the portal area and pull the tentacle terrors.  After the tentacle 
terrors are dead and everyone is buffed, check for any last wanderers around.  If all wanderers seem 
to be dead, pull Dracoliche and kill him.

<p>Then go all the way up North and pull any last wanderers you see, but of course don't go past the 
fire wall.

<p>Then go East along the South wall again and pull wanderers, until you can see the gorgon statue 
with gorgons flying all around it.  Once you are free from wanderers, pull that gorgon area.  Be 
careful to not run too close to the hills in the middle of the zone that Fright, Dread, and Terror 
are on.  They will aggro if you go too close and they will cause Cazic to begin to death touching.

<p>Once the gorgons are dead, pull the frightfinger house.  Once those are dead, check for any last 
wanderers again.

<p>Move the group East a little bit.  Pull Dread and Terror to the group one hill at a time.  Each of 
these will have 2 Amy knights or warriors with them.

<p>After those are dead, pull Fright and his 2 henchmen.  Be careful about aggroing Cazic on this 
pull.  Try to time the grab when Cazic is farther away.

<p>Once that is done, another tougher part of the game comes into play because it is now time to 
pull the temple.  Move your entire group to the NorthWest corner and situate them there.  Then get 
your best necro and have him go to the portal.  Have him get close to the temple and then cast 
harmshield on himself.  While he is harmshielded, get him to run into the temple and aggro every MOB 
(hopefully at lEast all the knights) and get harmtouched.  His harmshield should eat all the 
harmtouches and then have him (with SOW) run to the South wall with the MOBs on his tail.  Once he's 
there, get him to gate out ASAP.

<p>Hopefully he will live and the MOBs will be scattered.  Once the MOBs start going back, run in 
there and aggro some of the amy's and kite them around the big hill that the portal is sitting on.  
Make wide circles.  While you are kiting in circles, get another melee in your group, hopefully a 
monk, aggro a couple and bring them back to the group in the NW corner.  Kill these while you are 
still kiting the Amy's on you.  When those are dead, get the other monk to come get some more MOBs 
off of you until all the MOBs aggro on you are dead.

<p>Once those that are aggro are dead, run back to the temple and pull some more.  By this time if 
you did it right, none of the knights should have harm touches left and it should be a piece of cake.  
Pull them to the portal hill again and kite them around in circles like you were before.  Once all 
the temple MOBs are dead, you are almost done.

<p>Now you need to ask your friendly ranger what MOBs are still up, and pull them to the group until 
they are all dead.  Watch out for Cazic's aggro and don't get too close to him to get a MOB.

<p>Once you have pulled as many MOBs as you possible can without aggroing Cazic himself, get everyone 
to buff up.  Once everyone is buffed, designate someone as the death touch sacrifice (usually a gnome) 
and rush Cazic.

<p>When your sacrifice gets there, he will be death touched first thing.  If Cazic doesn't seem to be 
awake, have him cast on Cazic.  That'll get his attention fast.  Once the death touch has passed, 
kill Cazic.

<p>When Cazic is aggro, MOBs that are anywhere nearby will come after you.  So if you haven't killed 
some MOBs yet, prepare to mez the train that comes when you are killing Cazic.  Sometimes you'll 
have 1 glare lord that's still alive.  No big deal when this happens, just kill CT and get a 
chanter to mez the glare.

<h3>Fighting Dracoliche</h3>

<p>Big skeletal dragon, enough said.  Before the Draco pull, you need to buff up as usual 
and throw on some sv disease and magic buffs.  Kill the dragon, you probably have done 
something like this before.  After the dragon is dead, wait for the CAMP command.  When you 
see it, camp and return in however many minutes the leader specifies.  Do not check the Draco 
for loot.  Let the leader of the raid take care of this.  The leader is experienced, knows 
what the Draco drops, can tell at a quick glance what is NO DROP and what is not, can loot 
the droppable items, and handle the situation.  When you have safely killed the Draco, please 
do me a favor - Do not shout WHAT WAS THE LOOT?? and WHAT DID HE HAVE??? It really annoys 
everyone and you will find out soon enough.  It is considerate to wait for everyone to be 
back into the Plane before you announce the loot.

<p>Draco's special skills are an area effect Fear which is quite nasty.  He also has an area 
effect DoT called Rotting Flesh that is poison based.  Having a 100% poison resist will pretty 
much help you against this roar.  He can also cast other necro spells like Shock of Poison.
Make sure you CAMP after fighting Draco, he aggros Cazic Thule and Cazic will be death touching 
people throughout the fight as a result.

<p>Any pet class should have a pet summoned and buffed for fighting this dragon.

<A NAME="13">

<h3>Fighting Cazic Thule</h3>

<p>To prepare, cancel all the buffs you have on and, when given the signal, place 4 disposable 
buffs (or "crap buffs") on yourself.  My personal preference is to use J-Boots first, as you can 
quickly reactivate them after they are debuffed.  At the command, begin normal buffs.  Put Dead Man 
Floating or Levitate on as the final buff, as this negates his Gravity Flux damage.  Wait for the 
call, and charge him and kill him.  Not really much to it.  Like dragons, casters want to wait 
until the halfway mark to begin casting on Cazic Thule while the tanks work it down for the first 
half.  Cazic isn't very magic resistant, so casters are going to do really well here.  He hits for 
400 sometimes so he's a pretty rough melee MOB.  He also death touches people every 30 seconds.  If 
you have a lot of magic resistance, they're a slim chance you could survive this, but it's not 
bloody likely.  Tanks are essential.  They MUST interrupt him using bash, stun, etc.  Casters, when 
not casting, have to stay out of melee range.  Healers are an absolute must considering how much 
damage Cazic will do to the tanks and how long they have to fight him.  He has the ability to 
dispell buffs as well, but the worst part of this is the MOBs in the zone running at you.  That's 
right.  The moment he's attacked, he will summon everything left in the zone at you.  This is why 
you want to do Cazic last.  You want to clear all the MOBs in the zone that you can away before 
taking him on.  There's a big trick to doing Cazic though, and that's Fear.  Cazic is extremely 
susceptible to Fear spells.  If you keep him Feared and just plow him with large scale DoTs and 
such, you can't fail.

<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>You have demolished the entire Plane of Fear.  Give yourself a pat on the back.  Please 
congratulate the winners of the prizes.  Even if you really wanted the item, how would 
you like it if someone frowned when you won something? If all went well, you can wait for 
respawns.  The respawn cycle on MOBs in PoF is 13-14 hours with Cazic and Draco set to one 
week.  If you want to farm the zone, head back to the West camp and proceed to pull MOBs as 
they pop for the next week or so until a patch.  Or, for something a little more fun, wait until 
tomorrow and do the entire thing again.  It is much more rewarding to go into a place where 
the odds are against you and overcome the odds, than to sit for hours and hours arguing about 
loot and waiting for one poor MOB to spawn so 40 people can beat the crap out of it.  I hope 
this helps some people that want to go to Fear understand what is going on there.  I hope this 
takes some of the fear out of the Plane of Fear and removes the panic factor which can ruin 
everyone's time, as well as kill everyone.
