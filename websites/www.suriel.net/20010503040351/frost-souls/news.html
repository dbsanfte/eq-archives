<p class="head">The Latest Info &amp; Updates

<p><b>Saturday 14 April 2001</b>

<blockquote><p>More profile updates!
<p>I've got a new job which (a) severely cuts down on my playing time, and (b) limits the time I can spend on weekdays updating the site, so look for big updates each weekend!
<p>Also, check out <a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/bfrostsouls" target="_new">the message board</a> for some new topics!
</blockquote><br><br> 

<p><b>Sunday 08 April 2001</b>

<blockquote><p>Message board update
<p>I just spent about two hours fighting with EZBoard. Whoever wrote their code needs to be shot.
<p>But I digress. I've added a couple new <a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/bfrostsouls" target="_new">topics</a> and I hope you'll all take advantage of the message board to introduce yourselves, make suggestions, ask questions &amp; generally help us become a tighter-knit, friendlier guild!
<p>Go <a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/bfrostsouls" target="_new">have your say</a> now!

</blockquote><br><br> 

<p><b>Thursday 05 April 2001</b>

<blockquote><p>A whole slew of updates today!
<p>We've got many new <a href="members.html">members</a>, and a lot of new profile pages. Check them out!
</blockquote><br><br>

<p><b>Sunday 25 March 2001</b>

<blockquote><p>Sorry for the lack of updates. I've been busy looking for a job!
<p>I've got a few new profiles up: check out <a href="members/toradan.html">Toradan's</a>, <a href="members/alpolin.html">Alpolin's</a> and <a href="members/leanine.html">Leanine's</a> pages.
</blockquote><br><br>

<p><b>Sunday 18 February 2001</b>
<blockquote><p>We have sad news for you today.
<p>Our Fearless Leader, Torena, has stepped down as head of the guild. While remaining an officer, she has appointed Azzrealabyss to lead in her stead. She cites limited playing time as her reason for this changing of the guard. 
<p>She will try to stay as active as possible, but wants the Frost Souls to continue to grow into the wonderful guild she envisioned, and Azz shares that vision.
<p><a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/ffrostsoulsfrm1.showMessage?topicID=19.topic">Join me</a> in wishing her all the best.
</blockquote><br><br>

<p><b>Saturday 20 January 2001</b>
<blockquote><p>You can now <a href="member-info.html">submit your stats</a> for your own custom member page! Check out <a href="members/ynci.html">Ynci's member page</a> to see what these will look like. 
<p>In a future incarnation of this feature, you'll be able to update your own info. How cool is that?
</blockquote><br><br>


<p><b>Tuesday 09 January 2001</b>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/bfrostsouls">message board</a> now has two new sections: one for Officers only, and another for <b>Trade Skills</b>! This is intended to be a central place where you can see who has the skills you need.
</blockquote><br><br>

<p><b>Wednesday 27 December 2000</b>
<blockquote><p>The new website is up. And there was much rejoicing!
