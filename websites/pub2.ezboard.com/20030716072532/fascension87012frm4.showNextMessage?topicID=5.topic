We are looking for people who do not necessarily need a loot policy to do this, but would be willing to offer all significant loot to a fellow member in need and would trust leadership to facilitate this need. <br>
<br>
Need Before Greed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
NEED:<br>
The item will immediately replace an item currently being used by the character in attendance, or will be used in a quest that would result in an item upgrade for that character.<br>
<br>
GREED:<br>
The item is not needed by the character in attendance, but would be sold or used to equip an alternate character.<br>
<br>
The standard loot policy for Ascension Alliance is Need Before Greed (NBG).  The idea behind NBG is that whenever possible, all loot obtained through guild events will be distributed among those members present that can and WILL use an item. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Guild Groups</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
GROUP:<br>
Any scheduled or spontaneous event involving 6 or fewer members of any level.<br>
<br>
Guild groups and pickup groups may decide their own loot policy.<br>
<br>
It is extremely important that any time Ascension Alliance members form a group or join a group in progress, that they discuss the loot rules at the onset.  This ensures that everyone agrees to the arrangement and will help avoid any complications or loot issues within the group.  Whenever someone new joins the group, be sure to restate the loot rules.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Guild Raids</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
RAID:<br>
Any scheduled or spontaneous event involving 7 or more members of any level.<br>
<br>
At the onset of the raid, a member of The Council or the member with the most seniority present at the raid will be designated as the Loot Coordinator.  The Loot Coordinator designates a ML (Master Looter) for each group to be responsible for promptly looting their corpses and announcing all loot in the raid channel.  The Loot Coordinator will record all loot obtained during the raid and distribute the loot among the raid participants.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Distribution</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Distribution of an item will be based on the following 4 factors, in order of importance:<br>
<br>
1) Need - Members with greater need for an item will be considered before those that have less need. Members that already have an item of greater power or value will not be considered.<br>
<br>
2) Attendance - Members that attend raids regularly will be considered before those that attend occasionally.  This will usually be consistent with supplying those in the greatest need, as those who regularly raid have a greater need for powerful items.<br>
<br>
3) Level – Members of higher level will be considered before those of lower level.  This will usually be consistent with supplying those in the greatest need, as higher level characters regularly raid more difficult areas and therefore have a greater need for powerful items.<br>
<br>
4) Seniority - Members who have been in the guild longer will be considered before those that are new.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Tradable Items</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1) All equippable items obtained during a guild raid shall be held until the end of the raid and distributed among the members in attendance at the time the loot was obtained.  The Loot Coordinator will begin the distribution process by quickly ranking all loot that was collected during the raid in order of perceived value, and then announcing the full list to the raid channel.  Then, starting at the top of the list, the Loot Coordinator will announce a particular item and ask that if you NEED and wish to be considered that you /tell them with the link to your current item.  If more than one person is interested in an item and all other factors are approximately equal (need, attendance, level, seniority), the Loot Coordinator may choose to call for a /random to decide who will receive the item.<br>
<br>
2) Once you have received an item on a given raid you will generally not be considered again until everyone eligible has received an item.<br>
<br>
3) Please note the following exceptions:<br>
a) Quest gems, spells, cash, and vendor sellables are always collected for the AA Guild Treasury.<br>
b) Rare gems (Black Sapphires, Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, and Jacinths) will be held for the general random after all other loot is distributed.<br>
c) If no one on the raid needs an item, it will be held for the general random after all other loot is distributed.<br>
d) Any items remaining after distribution and the general random should be donated to the AA Guild Treasury.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         No Drop Items</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1) When a fight has finished, the ML of the group that received experience for the kill should immediately loot the corpse and announce all drops to the raid channel using the item link feature.  In the event of No Drop items, the ML locks the corpse and does not release it to anyone other than the Raid Leader, Loot Coordinator, or the person who has been awarded the item.<br>
<br>
2) If you NEED the item and wish to be considered you should immediately /tell the loot coordinator with a link to your current item.  Loot will be distributed when all eligible attendees are in the zone (in other words, after the dead have been rezzed and the LD have returned from EQ purgatory).  If an eligible attendee is still LD when 2 minutes remain on the corpse, the Loot Coordinator should distribute the item among those present.  While this is unfortunate for the player who went LD and therefore missed a chance at the item, it is far better than allowing an item to rot. <br>
<br>
3) Once you have received a No Drop item on a given raid you will generally not be considered for subsequent drops, with the following exceptions:<br>
a) Everyone eligible has already received an item.<br>
b) You are the only one on the raid who needs the item.<br>
c) The item is going to rot.<br>
d) The item is needed for your epic (see below).<br>
e) The item is a No Drop chest piece (due to their rarity, if one drops all eligible members will be considered).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         “Pass it on”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you obtain an item in any guild raid or group on the basis of NEED, you are strongly encouraged to give that item to another guild character or donate it to the Guild Treasury upon replacement. This is done in the spirit of helping your guild family in the same manner that they helped you obtain the item in the first place.  Please note that this is not an obligation, but merely a recommendation. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Quest Items</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The attendee who is farthest along on the quest will have priority rights to loot an item when it drops.  This includes items used in the completion of epic quests and other quests of epic proportions, such as deity specific weapons, Prayer Shawls, and Coldain Rings. The exception to this will be reserved items (see below).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Reserved Items</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Normally, the only items that may be reserved are pieces for epics. When raiding for epic drops, the person who has gone through the time to research, plan, and organize the raid has all rights to claim the epic piece when it drops.  The initial raid post must include a statement of any and all items that are reserved, and the reserved items must be announced to the raiding party at the onset of the raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Reimbursement of Expenses</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It is our policy to reimburse all members and guests for expenses incurred during an AA raid.  It is your responsibility to keep track of all gems, port stones, or coffins used during a raid, and inform the Raid Leader or Loot Coordinator if you wish to reimbursed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Guest Policy</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1) Members are encouraged to invite guests to raids by first requesting approval from the Raid Leader.<br>
<br>
2) The Raid Leader has the authority to approve as many guests as deemed necessary or desirable.<br>
<br>
3) When space is limited, preference for groups will always be given to guild members first.<br>
<br>
4) For the purposes of loot distribution, guests will be considered as members with zero seniority, following our standard Loot Policy, with the following exceptions:<br>
a) All equippable items are always reserved for AA members and will only be awarded to guests if no guild member present has NEED for the item.  <br>
b) Velious quest armor (Thurgadin, Skyshrine, Kael) is always reserved for AA members and will be looted for MQ if no guild member present can use the item.<br>
c) Epic drops are always reserved for AA members and will be looted for MQ if possible.  Epic drops will only be awarded to guests if no guild member present will use the item and MQ is not possible.<br>
