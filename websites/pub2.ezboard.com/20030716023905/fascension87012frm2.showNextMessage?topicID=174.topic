Just wanted to drop you all a note to say that I'm back home and I have my new computer!! It's very nice (components listed at the bottom) I'm still having some trouble with my whole in-home-network so I might be out of commision a few more days. I've been working all day to try to get my new router to work with my older computer (Compaq) but have been unable to. I had spent about 3 hours on the phone with the router manufacturer and Verizon to try to resolve the problem, but it was still not working. Then I connected my new computer to the router, fiddled with the settings a bit and VIOLA! it works. This is my first post from it.<br>
<br>
Ironically, the cable I bought today was built wrong (DUH) and it won't work, so my Compaq will still be out of commission until at least tomorrow.<br>
<br>
OK, here's the specs as far as I know of my new system. (my friend built it, not me.)<br>
<br>
AMD Athlon 1900+<br>
512 MB DDR (says 2100, does that mean anything)<br>
Maxtor 40GB/7200/133 EIDE Hard drive<br>
16x DVD<br>
Optical mouse<br>
WIN XP<br>
<br>
and here's the kicker (from what I'm told)<br>
<br>
G-force4 Ti 4200 nVidia with 128 DDR<br>
<br>
I also bought a 19&quot; (18.0&quot; viewable) flat screen monitor, a Linksys router, and some cheap speakers. I still intend on buying a new, bigger monitor for my Compaq, but I'm gonna wait until I can find a nice one for cheap. The ones I saw at Circuit City today were on sale (rebates) but weren't very good IMO. <br>
<br>
OH YEAH! I haven't told you all about my trip yet.<br>
<br>
Well, we left on Wednesday night from our apartment intended to stop around 8pm for dinner, and then around 12am at a hotel, trying to get north of D.C. before we stopped. Well, traffic was too backed up so we stopped early. We still made it past D.C. before we stopped at a hotel.<br>
The next day, we must have hit every patch of construction from here to Detroit, because we didn't get to the in-laws house until close to 10pm (we should have made it there by 6pm). But we made it there, safe and sound. <br>
The next morning, we left for Traverse City (our destination for Friday afternoon) We were going to one of my best friend's wedding, and I was the best man! (rehearsal was at 4:30pm, so we left at 9:30am to make sure we had PLENTY of time) Well, it was raining pretty hard, and I guess I was driving to fast, because we hydroplaned and went off the road! Now, we didn't just go off the road; we crossed 3 lanes while spinning 270 degrees around, hit the ditch with the back bumper and then went the rest of the 360 into the dirt wall! Luckily, noone else was involved, and noone was hurt. However, one of the back tires was chewed a little, and the rocker panel on the passenger side of our Grand Caravan was crunched. Did I mention I bought this vehicle on July 5th?!? That's right! My new van, crunched already!! (it's new to me, a '96) So, after being towed out, we went about 30 miles until we found someplace to buy some new tires (fortunately, I needed two new tires anyway), and had some lunch. After that, we proceeded north to Traverse City, and got there at 4:40pm! Just in time for the rehearsal!<br>
The rest of the time in Traverse City went just fine. My friend and his new bride had a beautiful wedding. Now for the trip back.<br>
A friend of ours traveled up north with us, in his Jeep Wrangler. He was right behind me when we went off the road. We called him Sunday morning to drive back, and met us in Graylin. However, we wasn't feeling well. In fact, we was feeling very ill, and I ended up driving his Jeep back to Clarkston instead of my van (he rode while my wife drove the van) Because of his illness, it took us almost 7 hours to drove a 3.5 hour trip! That's what friend's are for though, right?<br>
<br>
So, the rest of our stay was just vacation time, really. No obligations except to see our families and friends. Well, until Thursday, that is. See, my sister drove down from the Midland area (about 2 hours away) to see us, and the plan was to drive with her back up to the Saginaw area (about 1 hour away). Another one of sisters lives in the same area, but could only meet us for dinner because of work. That whole trip up and dinner and everything was great! BUT, about half way back to Clarkston, a deer ran out and I almost front ended it! Instead, I swerved, and the deer hit the side of my van instead! So now, not only is the side rocker panel crunched and the sliding door dented, the hood, fender panel, and front passenger door are all crunched and dented! She (it was a doe) even left some of her fur in the door handle!<br>
<br>
The trip back to Virginia wasn't too awful, except that it's 15 hours of almost straight driving. Even stopping for meals, it's a long trip. I just still can't believe that my new van got so messed up in such a short period of time. The other bad thing is that since both incident's are different in nature, I have to pay both deducibles, so that's another $1000 sunk into my new van (good thing I got it for 3k under blue book)<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's what's been happening to me this past 2 weeks. As soon as I can get my second computer online, I'll be seeing you all again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uselaheq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SelahEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Council Officer</span><br>  Posts: 1008<br> <font color=#333333>(8/4/02 8:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hello again all!!</span><hr size=1> Wow Xsav, sounds like you had a roller coaster ride of a week!  I was sitting on the edge of my seat as I read your story and was so glad to get to the end and find that you all made it home safe and sound.  There must have been some disturbance in the force because so many people I know had a really difficult time this week.<br>
<br>
As a side note, hearing you talk about your new computer inspired me to buy a new computer of my own.  Unfortunately, EQ hated it and refused to run (which of course is the one and only thing I really cared about).  So I am having them rebuild me a new one from scratch and should be getting it about Wednesday this week.  It's a AMD Athlon 1800+ with the same hard drive, OS, and video card you got.  I can't wait to take it for a spin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=82825" target="_blank"><font color="#333399">Selah</A><BR><A HREF="http://ascension_eq.tripod.com" target="_blank"><font color="#333399">Ascension Alliance</A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uwarmasterxsavuungllaahh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Council Officer</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#333333>(8/5/02 9:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hello again all!!</span><hr size=1> Nice! So far, I absolutely LOVE my new system. The graphics are so smooth, and that's with every graphic on. I haven't seen them in so long, it will be hard to get used to! <br>
<br>
I still haven't gotten my old computer to connect to my new router, but I hope to have that corrected today.  I think I might have a connectivity issue with the router, too. I was only on for about 30 minutes or so, and got disconnected twice (that's with DSL). My wife played for a couple hours after I went to bed though, so maybe it was just a gliche. I'll have to look more into that. I was so proud of myself that I actually got it working, considering I was on the phone for 3 hours with a tech that couldn't get my connected.<br>
<br>
Ah well. See you all soon!<br>

About the LD's in 30 minutes or so.... I've heard there's possible problems with Linksys routers... might wanna check that out.  Play with and without the router to check it, but that could be the problem source.<br>
