If you think you are interested in joining AA, it is important you understand that we are not a pure raiding guild, nor do we gather together for pure social aspects. We are a fun and friendly guild that approaches its objectives purposefully and professionally.<br>
<br>
For example, we do not have planned raids every day and attendance is never mandatory, however we enjoy tremendous participation in our raids. We gather to succeed and we learn from our failures, so that when we achieve our goals it is thanks to superior preparation, teamwork, strategy and skill, as opposed to sheer numbers or luck. On the days we don’t raid, we work on experience, quests, exploration, tradeskills, whatever strikes our fancy, always keeping in mind that EQ is a game and it is supposed to be FUN! <br>
<br>
We value quality over quantity, and we are proud that AA is home to so many quality players and quality people. Because we wish to maintain the same close-knit family feeling that we were founded upon and we want every member to feel like a valuable part of the team, we have established the following <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>minimum requirements for new members</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
- Prospective members should have at least one character that is level 58 or above and be committed to leveling and advancing that character. At this time we are accepting applications for members of all classes.<br>
<br>
- Prospective members should plan to play at least 3 times per week with us.<br>
<br>
- Prospective members should be ally to Claws of Veeshan or willing to work on this.<br>
<br>
- Prospective members should have all expansions enabled and a reliable internet connection.<br>
<br>
- Each prospective member MUST complete a separate application with ALL QUESTIONS ANSWERED.<br>
<br>
If you wish to apply to the guild but you do not meet the minimum requirements, please talk to an officer before you submit your application.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Applying for membership:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1) Before applying to Ascension Alliance, please be sure you have read all of our rules carefully and that you agree to abide by our <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm4.showMessage?topicID=5.topic" target="top">Code of Honor</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm4.showMessage?topicID=6.topic" target="top">Code of Conduct</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. <br>
<br>
2) Please introduce yourself in our <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm6" target="top">Recruitment Forum</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> by creating a &quot;New Topic&quot;. Copy and paste the following questions into your post and be sure to answer each question completely:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>
* Character(s) Name/Class/Race/Level/AA Points/Major AA Skills</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We expect that you will guild all your characters 29th level and higher should your application be accepted. Sorry, but we do not permit alternates in other guilds. You may wish to include your Magelo Profile and Guild Magic Profile in your application.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>* What days and times do you typically play (time zone)?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We have players from around the world and we usually group and raid together whenever we are online! In addition, our scheduled activities typically begin at 7:30PM EST Monday-Friday and anytime Saturday- Sunday, so we are primarily looking for people who can consistently attend raids during those times. Most major raids are scheduled about two weeks in advance to allow advance planning on your part.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>* What is your previous guild experience?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What guilds have you been in and what were the circumstances surrounding your departure? Are you currently a member of a guild, and if so, why are you seeking to leave them for Ascension Alliance? Are you applying to any other guilds?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>* Why do you wish to join Ascension Alliance?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Who do you know in the guild? Have you grouped or raided with us? What do you expect to contribute to the guild? What do you expect to get in return?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>* Is there anything else you'd like us to know?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Use this space to share any other information you feel would be helpful for your application - epic status, tradeskills, keys/flags you have obtained, special experience with zones/mobs, multiple accounts, etc.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>* After you have posted your application in the Recruitment Forum, please email a copy to selaheq@netscape.net</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Please copy your entire application and paste it into an email with your character name in the subject line. The email copy is required so that we will be able to contact you if necessary so please use an email account you check regularly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Please be sure to answer all of the questions! The more detailed your responses, the better - we want to get to know you as best as we can. Applications that are missing any of the requested information will be delayed.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
3) Submitting an application does not guarantee you a promise of membership, however if you meet our minimum requirements you will be welcome to raid with us so we can get to know you better. Once your application has been approved by three or more members, you will be invited to the guild for a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>two-week Trial membership</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. If your application is opposed by three or more members, you will not be eligible for trial membership at this time and we will inform you of this in game.<br>
<br>
As a Trial Member, you will be expected to perform your duties and contribute to the guild just as you would if you were a Full Member. You will have the same rights and privileges as a Full member except that you will not have access to the private Guild Forums, you will receive lower priority when loot is distributed, and you will not be entitled to any guild assistance for epic quests. Trial members may have a maximum of 2 characters invited to the guild provided that each character meets the minimum requirements.<br>
<br>
During your Trial membership, you will be evaluated in each of the following categories:<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><br>
Class Skill</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> – You must know your class, LOVE it, and play it well. You should definitely know your role in a group or raid situation and be flexible enough to adapt your play style to make the most valuable contribution at any given time. This includes working well with the members of your class to delegate responsibilities and fulfill your role to perfection! Of course, we will be watching to make sure you know how to manage your aggro, follow directions, pay attention, etc. While some of these skills are learnable, by level 58 it is expected that you have learned basic raid conduct and behavior.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Attendance and Participation</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> - Over the course of the Trial membership period, we will be able to get a good overall impression of your future attendance and guild participation. This includes raids, groups, events, chat, forums, etc. As a Trial member, you are welcome to come to any event, and the more you can attend, the better. Group with AA members as much as possible and set yourself to autojoin the aafriends channel every time you log on. Visit the forums regularly, daily if possible. You wouldn’t believe how many AA folks actually have jobs and when you post something for them to read it really makes their day!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Motivation, Attitude and Character</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> - During your Trial membership period, you will be getting to know the other members and learning how we all work together. To ensure your success, you must make the effort to get to know us, stay on top of guild events, help out whenever possible, hang out in the aafriends channel during non-raid times, and continue to do so while awaiting your response. Persistency and Consistency are the keys to your success! It is also expected that you will accept constructive criticism gracefully, look upon failures as good learning experiences, and handle deaths cheerfully. During raids, your first and foremost thought should be how you can contribute and prove your worth, not what loot might drop or whether you are facing a CR.<br>
<br>
While you are a Trial Member, the members will continue to comment on your application and the officers will vote whether to extend your invitation to Full membership based upon the member response. Once the officers have approved your application, you be given <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Full membership</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> status and immediately receive the full rights and privileges of membership, including automatic membership for all characters level 29+, inclusion on the Guild Magic roster, access to private Guild Forums, ability to schedule events on the Guild Calendar, loot consideration, eligibility for leadership positions within the guild, etc.<br>
<br>
The Trial membership period will last approximately 2 weeks but may be terminated early by either party for any reason and without penalty. A Trial member who was not offered full membership may reapply at any time they believe their situation to have changed.<br>
<br>
