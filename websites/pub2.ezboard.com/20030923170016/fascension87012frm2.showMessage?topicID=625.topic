I had asked everyone in the group if they had heard the story, and while most did one or two hadn't so I figured I'd post it here to make sure everyone gets the chance to see it.  So here it is, both parts.<br>
<br>
__________________________<br>
<br>
So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of a sudden I see <br>
the message: &quot;d00d sow plz&quot;. <br>
<br>
Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the clueless newb <br>
(hereafter referred to politely as &quot;the petitioner&quot;) must have been poorly informed at <br>
best. <br>
<br>
Boy was I ever wrong. <br>
<br>
I switch out of 1st person into an external camera, and what did my wandering eyes <br>
behold? Only myself and the petitioner. <br>
<br>
So I says to myself....&quot;Self? You need to edumacate this fella!&quot; <br>
<br>
(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton form, <br>
carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE <br>
dark-brown skeleton named &quot;Gibober&quot; standing behind me. Ummm....No, skippy, <br>
I'm not a druid or a shaman.) <br>
<br>
I say &quot;Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Petitioner says, &quot;$#*&amp;@#$ dick, sow me already! it's for a cr&quot; <br>
<br>
Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a &quot;/who all dumbass&quot; (um..pardon..I <br>
meant &quot;/who all petitioner&quot;) <br>
<br>
This is where I discovered the &quot;/who all&quot; bug. Certainly it must have been a bug, right? <br>
There's NO WAY IN CREATION the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level <br>
31 Dark Elf Wizard, right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a little girl. <br>
<br>
Well, needless to say, I couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet began <br>
dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while <br>
deciding how best to deal with this tricky situation. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Necromancer's can't cast SoW&quot;. <br>
<br>
Petitioner says, &quot;Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you sped up! i <br>
couldn't catch you until you sat down! if you're not going to sow me just say so you <br>
dont have to be a dick about it a$$hole&quot; <br>
<br>
Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I have JBoots.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;what are they&quot; <br>
<br>
Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor.... <br>
<br>
Petitioner asks, &quot;can you buff my hps my hp sux&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I can't buff you, dude. I'm a necromancer. I only have one buff that you would <br>
probably want.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;yeah the one you won't give me dick&quot; <br>
<br>
Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Why do you need a sow?&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for my level&quot; <br>
<br>
Yep. That's what he said......&quot;burned woods&quot;. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;man are you ever in the wrong place.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br>
<br>
Apparently he found the &quot;question mark&quot; key conveniently located nearby other various <br>
and sundry communication facilitators. <br>
<br>
I didn't answer him. <br>
<br>
He repeats, &quot;??&quot; <br>
<br>
Found it twice...good for him. <br>
<br>
He repeats, &quot;???&quot; <br>
<br>
Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You are NO WHERE near Burned Woods.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;my friend told me it was in kunark&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a couple of <br>
months ago after a bunch of complaints were filed about 'static content'.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;!&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;,&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;***&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;no, already have some.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;????&quot; <br>
<br>
I don't respond. <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;so where the @#$% is burned woods&quot; <br>
<br>
He lost the question mark button again. Probably popped off when he was sniffing his <br>
feet. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch, since they <br>
began randomizing zone locations.&quot; <br>
<br>
My guild is hysterical at this point. And I haven't even told them the ENTIRE story yet. <br>
Just snippets. <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;@#$% i just got off the boat&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You don't need the boat.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says &quot;why&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You're a wizard!&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;how you know that&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have teleportation spells.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;oh yeah the green ones&quot; <br>
<br>
I nod. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by color.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;thx&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;How'd you think about doing it that way?&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;they were all @#$%## up when i got this char&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;why&quot; <br>
<br>
Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair, guy. Mixed in with your <br>
collection of boogers. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;how do you know&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;All patch messages come with a zone connection map.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;oh&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Ok. You have it memmed now?&quot; <br>
<br>
He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell book. <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;yeah&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell. <br>
<br>
A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes <br>
I still haven't heard from him. <br>
<br>
Getting curious: <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;Are you there yet?&quot; <br>
<br>
No reply. No reply at all. [Yes, I'm a Genesis fan... ] <br>
<br>
Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through. <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;Hit the 'r' key to reply to me.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i'm here now where do i go.&quot; <br>
<br>
Right idea....wrong punctuation mark. Oh well. &quot;C&quot; for effort. <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense Heading'?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;no&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one.&quot; <br>
<br>
It was a guess, but an educated one. <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;found it&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Click on it.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;north&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path turns north. <br>
When it forks to the right, take the right fork.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;ok&quot; <br>
<br>
Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked his Felwithe faction up. <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;sumbody told me i shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;They were roleplaying.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P&quot; <br>
<br>
Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you. <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Where are you?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i see something now. looks like a castle&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you some trouble, <br>
just keep running.&quot; <br>
<br>
Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in. <br>
<br>
A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was expecting. <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;What happened?&quot; <br>
<br>
As if I didn't know.... <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;my spells are gone!&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;What happened?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i died why&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;east ***???&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Yikes. My bad. You should have run west.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;?&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;So where are you now?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;how can i tell&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Look right after you see 'Loading please wait'. It should tell you 'You have <br>
entered [zone]'.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies &quot;it doesnt say [zone] there.&quot; <br>
<br>
After smacking my head against my monitor.... <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;What does it say in place of [zone]?&quot;. <br>
<br>
Get this.... <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;Burning Woods&quot; <br>
<br>
I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way! <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;is that the same as burned woods&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your corpse back.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i have to get my corpse back?????&quot; <br>
<br>
/ignore petitioner <br>
<br>
Moral of the story: EBay...Just Say No! <br>
<br>
Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what happened. <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;How's it going?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;***? where you been&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;been afk, sorry.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me.&quot; <br>
<br>
My conscience somewhat eased... <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Really? Cool! Where are you now?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;iceclad ocean&quot; <br>
<br>
I scratch my head a few times. <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Why Velious?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western wastes this <br>
week&quot; <br>
<br>
I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped breathing shortly <br>
before my dog dialed 911. <br>
<br>
He replied, &quot;@#$%&amp;* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?&quot; <br>
<br>
That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;This is the follow up story from the cleric who rezzed him near Felwithe.<br>
Friend of mine digged it up, probably on the same necro side. &quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Here comes some idiot Dark Elf running past me, running straight down the road<br>
that is going to lead him to Felwithe. I scratch my head, and being the nosey<br>
sort of Dwarf that I am...I send him a tell. <br>
<br>
I tell the DE, &quot;Wait&quot; <br>
<br>
DE tells me, &quot;?&quot; <br>
<br>
I sigh into my ale as I take another longt draught off of it before running up<br>
to him and saying, &quot;Ye really don't wanna go messin around over there with them<br>
High Elves' They look like pansies, but they aint.&quot; <br>
<br>
The DE stands there with a vacant look on his face for a few minutes before just<br>
running away. Do a /who on the DE and find out he's 31st level. Ok, so maybe he <br>
knows what he's doing. I've seen Ogres in North Freeport, after all. I go back <br>
to drinking my ale. <br>
<br>
Out of curiosity, I send him another tell a few minutes later. <br>
<br>
I tell the DE, &quot;Not gettin' into any trouble over there are ye?&quot; <br>
<br>
DE tells me, &quot;**** !@#$% roleplayer&quot; <br>
<br>
I sigh into my ale again, finishing it off. Ah, tis the season of the twit. I <br>
stand up and head towards Felwithe to resupply my ale. <br>
<br>
Just as I get to the gates of the ugliest city on Norrath, what do I find but a <br>
dead dark elf and a pair of guards snickering and cleaning their weapons. Now <br>
this is priceless. <br>
<br>
I do a /who on the poor soul and see he is in Burning Woods. Being the sucker <br>
that I am, I feel compelled to rez the twit...after all, I am a !@#$% roleplayer <br>
and I roleplay a !@#$% cleric...albeit a !@#$% grumpy one. <br>
<br>
I sit down to mem Reviviscene and while I am waiting for it to refresh I send <br>
the DE a tell. <br>
<br>
I tell the DE, &quot;Would ye like a rez?&quot; <br>
<br>
DE tells me, &quot;no i want a !@#$% sow dumbas i have to run south to get my corpse <br>
back so dont be a dick and just sow me plz&quot; <br>
<br>
I look around for an ale but unfortunatly Brell hates me at this moment in time, <br>
so I simply reply. &quot;If I rez ya, ye wont need to run south to yer body. You will <br>
appear at yer body. I am not standing near you, I am standing near yer corpse.&quot; <br>
<br>
DE tells me, &quot;d00d rez plz&quot; <br>
<br>
As I sigh I look at my Holy Symbol of Brell and sigh &quot;I'm gonna get a stout <br>
named after me right?&quot; and I tell the DE &quot;Consent me so I can rez ya&quot; but I get <br>
no reply. No reply at all. So I say it again &quot;Consent me so I can rez ya&quot; <br>
<br>
DE tells me, &quot;ok you can rez me&quot; <br>
<br>
I sit down again at this point. I have no ale and this is gonna take awhile. I <br>
tell the DE, &quot;Type /consent and my name&quot; Being a smart dwarf I tell the DE, <br>
&quot;/consent Cleric_01&quot; and say again &quot;Just like that&quot; before he can make my head <br>
hurt more. <br>
<br>
Sure enough, I recieve consent to drag his corpse. So I stand up and get ready <br>
to drag the corpse when suddenly I am denied permission to drag his corpse. I <br>
begin to think like him and I think &quot;***?&quot; So I tell the DE, &quot;No...just type it <br>
once. One more time. That's it. Dont type it again&quot; thinking that as soon as I <br>
get this over with, I can go buy more ale and my head will stop hurting. <br>
<br>
I recieve consent and I quickly drag it towards the zone since this is the <br>
direction the guy was going anyway. I get the body by the zone and cast Rez on <br>
it, comforted by the fact that I am one heal away from being done with this guy. <br>
<br>
The naked DE appears in front of me and I stand up to cast my final spell of <br>
this exchange when he says to me &quot;your that !@#%% roleplayer&quot; and then a moment <br>
later, almost as an afterthought &quot;thx&quot; <br>
<br>
Compelled at this point, I ask &quot;Why were you running into Felwithe when you are <br>
KoS?&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;I was going to burned woods&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Burning Woods?&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;no dumbass i go there when i die i want to hunt burned woods&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Who told you to go hunting in Burned Woods, inside Felwithe?&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;some dick who wouldnt sow me&quot; and then &quot;will you sow me plz, its for a <br>
CR&quot; <br>
<br>
I stand there drooling on myself for a moment, trying to catch up. I havent had <br>
an ale in a good 20 minutes at this point, so I am starting to see spots. <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;dont be a dick just sow me before they move the zone again&quot; <br>
<br>
I stare at the lad and ask &quot;Move Burned Woods? Again?&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;yea&quot; <br>
<br>
I finally snap and say, &quot;They aren't going to move it again. Once they moved it <br>
to Western Wastes, with all the snow, it stopped burning.&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;i saw a burning tree&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Exactly my point. Now if they would only move Burning Woods there it <br>
would stop too and people wouldn't go there when they die.&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;can you sow me, its for CR&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;sow doesnt work in IC until you get past EW and then it will work for <br>
CR's only until you get to WW, then ask the first person you see for sow there.&quot; <br>
I add as an afterthought &quot;Sometimes they look like flying blue things but they <br>
can sow&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;***???&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Allow me to use smaller words. You do not need a sow yet. Do what I say <br>
and you'll get there right away.&quot; and then &quot;Sit down and mem the spell Bind <br>
Affinity&quot; <br>
<br>
DE is silent for a bit and finally says &quot;its red&quot; as he is standing up <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I am glad they covered Colors this week. Now target yourself and cast <br>
this spell. &quot; He just stands there for a minute, so I add &quot;it will r0ck&quot; and he <br>
begins to cast the spell, binding himself behind the guards at Felwithe. I feel <br>
somewhat better already, maybe I dont need ale. <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;it said bound&quot; and begins to giggle <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Now sit down and mem the spell Iceclad Gate. This will r0ck even more.&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;this one is green&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You're damn good at those colors man&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;thx&quot; <br>
<br>
When the DE stands up I say &quot;This is going to take you to Iceclad Ocean. It's an <br>
ocean so that's why they moved Burned Woods there....to put it out.&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;what about sow&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Remember that sow wont work until you are on a CR in WW. In fact you <br>
actually run faster in snow if you set the RUN button to WALK. Do that now.&quot; <br>
<br>
DE says, &quot;ok&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Now cast Iceclad Gate....the Green one. Remember to run straight out of <br>
where you appear and dont stop swimming until you hit Burned Woods.&quot;<br>
<br>
DE begins to cast a spell and I zone in to get my ale....remembering that the <br>
Ignore list cures most headaches that ale cant and feeling somewhat better about <br>
going back to Sebilis. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/bascension87012.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ishiipower>Ishiipower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Member</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#333333>(8/12/03 8:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=625.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A must read</span><hr size=1> <br>
