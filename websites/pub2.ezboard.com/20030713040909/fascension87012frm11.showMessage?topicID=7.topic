The wind blew so hard that the falling snow appeared to be flying sideways rather than gently gliding to the frozen ground. Nothing, it seemed, could survive the elements on this fierce night. <br>
~A weary orc steps forth into the freezing wastelands. His goal, to retrieve firewood to keep the flames in the center of the orcish fort burning brightly through this devilish night. The wind whistles by his tiney ears so visciously it is like the screaming of a scorn banshee, he thinks. Fighting against the screaming wind and the snow hitting him so hard it feels as if his flesh may actually be torn, he toils in his task.<br>
~In the corner of his eye he catches the glimpse of a figure moving through the cursed weather. Quickly he turns and draws his sword! Is this a foe, or is it the messenger with word of dwarven activity? Taking no chances he peers through untrusting eyes. The figure is no longer there! Hmmmph, thinks the orc, I must have imagined it. The now very cold and slightly shaken orc turns back to his task.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Pardon me&quot;, says a strangely familiar voice, &quot;We must speak old friend&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
~The orc reels, trying to turn and draw his weapon once again! Firewood spills into the powdery snow at his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who's there!&quot;, scowls the orc, &quot;Orcs bash, orcs kill, your blood will spill!&quot;<br>
<br>
~Franticly he searches the wastelands with his squinting eyes, seeing nothing but the terrible snow. It is then when he feels a tap at his shoulder. Again he spins around, lashing out with his blade. Much to his surprise, the attack passes directly through it's target, leaving it undamaged! Again, and again he unleashes his flurry of attacks to no avail.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Fool!, booms the voice of a ghostly figure, &quot;You cannot harm me for I fell many a year ago, and to more powerfull foes than you!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
~The orc gasps and recoils in terror, then stumbles and falls over the wood beneath his feet. The ghostly figure looms over him, nearly transparent, but clearly horribly disfigured and decayed!<br>
<br>
&quot;This cannot be!&quot;, the orc shudders while raising an arm to cover his face, &quot;Scarley? I saw you die. You can't be here. This isn't real! You are a figment of my imagination, a fragment of undigested rabbit, or a lump of underdone gnome!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Silence!&quot;, says Scarley visibly irritated, &quot;I am real! As real as the sun or the moon or that blade on the ground beside you. I have come this evening to save you from the same fate that has befallen me, my dear old friend Groolge. I am cursed to walk Norrath for eternity, unable to change the wrong-doing that has doomed me. Don't make the same mistakes I did&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cursed?..Doomed?..Mistakes?&quot;, stammers Groolge.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;You will be visited by three ghosts this Christmas Eve&quot;, states Scarley, &quot;The first shall arrive at midnight, the second at one, and the third whenever he means to.&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ghosts?....Christmas? Bah, humbug!&quot; announces Groolge defiantly.<br>
<br>
~No sooner does Groolge let those words pass his gnarled lips than Scarley vanishes! A foul voice lingers on the frozen air.......<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Three ghosts Groolge, three ghosts&quot;&gt; The voice fades.<br>
<br>
~Clearly disturbed, Groolge tries to dismiss the incident as he braces against the wind and regains his footing. &quot;This did not happen&quot;, he thinks to himself, &quot;I am obviously over-tired.&quot; He returns to his task of gathering wood, grumbling to himself.......<br>
<br>
&quot;Christmas.......Ghosts.......Curses..........Bah, humbug!&quot;<br>
<br>
~His arms now full of firewood, Groolge turns to return to the warmth of the fortress dens. Bent nearly over in two, he trudges toward the now closed gates. Suddenly he hears the tower guard growl.......<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;It is twelve o'clock and the gates still hold!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Twelve o'clock!&quot;, gasps Groolge!<br>
<br>
~He begins to hurry himself, fighting the wind, the snow, and the darkness. His eyes fixed on his goal, the fortress gates! A howl in the wind forms a word...........<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Grrrrrrrroooooooooooooooooooooooolge&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
~Nearly to a panic, Groolge begins to run. He can barely see the light of the fortress bouncing ever closer. He slips on a patch of ice, hidden by the falling snow. Firewood flies into the night storm.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Grrrrrrrroooooooooooooooooooooooolge&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
~He hears it again! This time louder and more clearly. Franticly he scrambles to get to his feet. No longer is the firewood a priority in his mind, which is now wracked with terror. Carelessly he runs now, unable to see and unwilling to look behind him. Again he stumbles. This time as he lifts his scarred face from the snow, he finds himself staring at two hairy feet in front of him. Slowly his gaze lifts upward to find a halfling warmly smiling at him.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;My name is Turro&quot;, says the halfling with a smile, &quot;I am the ghost of Christmas past!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;But, but, but....you are not dead Mr. Turro!&quot;, blubbers Groolge, &quot; I've seen you running through these parts recently.&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Shut up, you stupid orc!&quot;, commands Turro, &quot;You'll ruin my cameo! Now come along my filthy friend, I have much to show you.&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
~The world blurs and fades away! Something new begins to come into focus. Suddenly Groolge finds himself standing before a fairly large oval shaped basin. Confused, he asks......<br>
<br>
&quot;What is this before me m'lord?&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;It is what my people call a bath tub&quot;, says Turro, &quot;and you should try one sometime, you stinking wretch! But there is more you must see!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
~Again the world blurs and fades away! As the lights and colors before him start to come to focus, Groolge hears dwarven children laughing and sounds of music fill the air. Before him, dwarves exchange gifts and play music and prepare a glorious feast! Children run throughout the camp slinging decorations of ornately designed strings covered with candy and trinkets over doorways and around poles. The overwhelming joy begins to bring a tear to Groolge's battle-hardened eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are we? Why have you brought me here master Turro?&quot; Groolge inquires.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Just keep watching you pile of refuse&quot;, demands Turro.&gt;<br>
<br>
~Suddenly, battle drums sound in the distance! The drums are so loud the whole bustling dwarven outpost seems silent. A horn sounds, and a volley of orcish arrows decend on the camp. Dwarven men, women, and children alike are impaled with the deadly projectiles! The dwarven men scramble to take up arms as the women scramble to stash the children to safety. Alas, it is too late! A horde of orcs pile into the outpost as the sound of clashing metal and screams pierce the night air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey! Hey! What is going on?&quot;, shreeks Groolge!<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Don't you remember?&quot;, asks Turro, &quot;This is one of many raids you lead on dwarven outposts. This one on Christmas eve five years ago!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Christmas eve? Bah, humbug!&quot;, growls Groolge, &quot;Christmas is a miserable season full of cursed snow and this confounded dwarven singing! They got what they deserved for having there guard down!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Is that so?, questions Turro, &quot;So be it then!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
~Turro winds up and delivers a viscious blow to the back of Groolge's head with his staff! The world goes black and silent..............................................<br>
<br>
~As Groolge struggles to regain consciousness, he feels the bitter cold of the snow almost fully covering him as he lay amidst  his scattered firewood. With the familiar sound of the howling wind he realizes he is back in front of his sanctuary, the fort! &quot;I must have hit my head when I fell carrying all this wood and dreamed that madness&quot;, he thinks to himself. Relieved, he begins to recollect his scattered firewood and resume his mission.<br>
~As he finally arrives at his destination, the fortress gates, he lets loose a great sigh of relief. This has been a strange night out in the storm full of unnatural devilry and he is looking forward to the warm glow of the fire. Groolge looks up searching the top of the wall for the tower guard so he can request entry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello!&quot;, shouts Groolge, &quot;Is anyone there? I need the gate opened! I have the wood!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;You shall not enter yet, orc!&quot;,  came a reply from above, &quot;You are not nearly finished with this night!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha.....What are you talking about?&quot;, shouts Groolge in return.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Do you have the time?, asks the raspy voice.&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;N...N...No&quot; answers Groolge, beginning to feel unnerved.<br>
<br>
~A figure appears on the wall. Squinting, Groolge cannot make him out. Without warning the figure jumps off the wall. The powdery snow before him explodes upward into his face with the impact of this stranger's feet striking the ground! No being can survive that jump, thought Groolge, as he whiped snow from his face and took a few steps back. As the cloud of disturbed snow was blown quickly away, the now visibly human figure stood directly in front of him.........unharmed!<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;I will tell you what time it is!&quot;, the human said threateningly, &quot;It is one AM&quot;&lt;*Groolges eyes widen*&gt;&quot;and you may call me Deador, the ghost of Christmas present!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
~Upon completing the introduction, Deador immediately leaps forward, kicking Groolge in the face and rendering him unconscious!<br>
<br>
~Some time later, Groolge begins to stir, his head now pounding. As he looks around he begins to realize he is once again in a dwarven outpost. It is dilapitated and war scarred. The dwarves living there are dirty and tired looking. He notices there are no children, and no singing, and no music.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are we here, Deador?&quot;, asks Groolge<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;We are here to show you what you and your filthy orcs have done to these once proud people&quot;, answers Deador, &quot;Thanks to your kind, even on Christmas there is little celebration or joy here. Just many painful memories. This is how the dwarves are spending this Christmas eve! I bring you here to search for a thread of remorse or reason to stay the blade of retribution hanging above your fortress as we speak! You are here to be JUDGED!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
~Groolge is silent for a moment..........but then begins to laugh uncontrollably. The idea of an orc feeling bad about what he has done to the dwarves is absurd in his mind. In secret he is actually planning to send out a patrol to finish the dwarves off when he returns home. But his scheming is cut short by a flying kick from Deador. Once again the world goes black and silent.............................<br>
<br>
~A while later, Groolge awakes to find himself laying amidst his firewood again. This time he does not wish to chance if it was real or not. He does not any longer care about the firewood strewn about his feet. Only one thought haunts Groolge now...........to get inside the fort and band his brethren together to finish off the dwarves he now knows are at this moment broken and defenseless! <br>
~As he gets to his feet, he hears what sounds like thunder. Groolge turns to see what is approaching behind him. He fights to get a glimpse through the foul weather as he squints to protect his eyes from the pelting snow. He can barely make out what looks like a hooded figure running toward him. Frightened beyond belief, he drops to his knees, praying outloud for forgiveness and to please spare him from this newest ghost! Just as the figure gets close enough to see his red eyes glowing from inside his hood, Groolge is blinded by a flash of light from something the figure pulled from beneath his cloak. He fights to regain his vision just as he hears a terrible slashing sound and feels a sharp pain. The running has stopped now, the figure stands behind him. As groolge turns to look back at this newest ghost he feels as if he's losing his balance and falls. Momentarily he is blinded again, this time by the snow. As his vision clears, Groolge discovers in horror, that he is indeed staring up at his own headless body that is still kneeling before him. The world begins to spin and his vision to blur, he can feel himself slipping off into shadow!<br>
~The hooded figure, now joined by the halfling and the human, slowly removes his hood revealing his long gray hair, blue skin, and white facial hair speckled with blood. His sword dripping foul smelling orc blood into the snow, Malevolentt leans over Groolge's severed head to see the life drain from his eyes and asks...................<br>
<br>
&quot;How many more you think are in there?&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Not sure&quot;, says Deador laughing, &quot;but this is the most fun Christmas eve I've ever had!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;This is a trip&quot;, adds Turro chuckling to himself, &quot;I got 12 more on track and the chief.&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;You ready for some more, Val?&quot;, inquires Malevolentt.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;You better believe it, Let the bodies hit the floor!&quot;, replies Valaura as she mems illusion Scarley.&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;My turn, my turn, Mal&quot;, says Cannista as she jumps up and down, &quot;You've already cleaved about 7 heads, give the rest of us a chance!&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;OK, OK, your turn&quot;, answers Malevolentt as he whipes orc blood from his sword, &quot;You do a few, then Larel, then Xsavuung, then Notinth, and who else is in on this? By the way, Amble, could you stop poking the body with a stick please?&quot;<br>
<br>
~The guild errupts with noise as everyone volunteers to take a turn. Tiberiussirk reminds everyone to stay invis while &quot;the ghosts&quot; do their thing! <br>
<br>
&quot;No worries, we'll roll and everyone will get a turn&quot;, says Malevolentt, &quot;hehe stupid orcs&quot;<br>
