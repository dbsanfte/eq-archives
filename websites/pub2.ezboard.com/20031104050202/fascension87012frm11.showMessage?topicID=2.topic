Nasgar, a felwithian born high elf had compassion for the efforts of his first son Lunitar's sorcerey.  But alas as a member of the city council he was bound by law to pass on the same discipline's as generation from generation of councilmen had enstilled.<br>

He much preferred to spend his time in research and raiding with his friends.  What use were politics to a young man?  But Lunitar was a good son, and although it might take some coaxing to pry him from his bed, if his father demanded he accompany him on his rounds, then Lunitar willingly went.<br>
<br>
Besides, there was always the hope that he might see Solana while he was out, and this in itself was motivation enough.  As this thought crossed his unconcious mind, Lunitar awoke. <p><A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=82825"><font color="#333399">Selah</A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uotisknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>OtisKnight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(5/8/02 4:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Continue the story!</span><hr size=1> Lunitar spotted his good dwarven friend Jollyjoe while with his father.

Luntitar decides to use the ATM machine to save time as the line was long and the bank as someone had trained the banker to the zone. &lt;approaches the ATM machine&gt; /Welcome, Insert your card/<br>
&lt;Lunitar inserts his card&gt;<br>
/choose your language/<br>

<br>
/ Which Backpack would you like to open select 1 - 8 , or for just plat enter amount /<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar selects 1000pp&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;ahhhh this should be enough for clubbing, The twins should be there this evening!! &quot;<br>
<br>
/ Take your receipt /<br>
/ Thank you for using First Norathian Bank/<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar pockets the plat&gt;<br>
<br>
*YOU have been ensnared by roots*<br>
<br>
&lt;Luntiar gasps in shock&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;ACK!! its a holdup!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;From the shadows a figure emerges&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk grins evilly at Lunitar&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhhhh, what have we here? seems someone was about to donate to my charity fund!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stand back!! Stand back I tell you!! You shall not have my plat! The twins MUST not be disappointed!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar starts to cast a spell&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar is hit with a bust of flame&gt;<br>
<br>
*Your spell is interrupted*<br>
<br>
&quot;What the?? a first lvl druid spell?&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Tiberiussirk steps from the shadows holding a fire beetle eye&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot; LOL you didn’t think rogues could root did you?!? Of course its me!!! you should never have never ninja looted those bat wings so many years ago!! For now vengeance is MINE!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk looks at Tibs a bit confused&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummmm yeah, so anyway, Hand over your plat and no one gets hurt!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;From the near-by pub, a huge beast stumbles out&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;BAH!! I din't likeish your songs &lt;hick&gt; annywayy!!  &lt;hick&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;a large tiger emerges right behind the beast apologizing profusely&gt;<br>
<br>
/Notinths Warder says/<br>
&quot;I am so sorry ladies and gentlemen, t'would seem that my large companion here doth suffer from too much Nip! Once again, our humblest apologies and may the blessings of your gods guide your travels and future adventures! DRINKS ON ME!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;a loud clamor is heard as the entire bar scrambles to counter to order drinks on Notinth's tab&gt;<br>
<br>
/Notinth Warder says/<br>
<br>
&quot;ahhh, my dear friend, once again your obsession with nip has gotten you in trouble and has required my intervention. Had the barkeep not sent me a tell, you may have been in serious trouble!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;BAH!!! I could take thhhem!! &lt;hic&gt; there wwass onlyy one hundereed of them! &lt;hic&gt;<br>
<br>
/Notinth Warder sighs/<br>
<br>
&quot;yes, yes, of course you could have my large friend!! But alas, it is late and you need you rest! For  our quest for Elder Animist Dunal starts tomorrow and it is of vital importance to Shar Vahl!! If the Dark Animalist Draz Nurakk is not stopped, Shar Vahl will surly fall!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth stands up straighter, pulls his pants up around his waist and says?<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is Draz Nurakk?&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth Warder sighs once again&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never mind, just follow me tomorrow&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth glances over toward the bank and sees Lunitar, Pykk, and Tibs&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;LOOK Notinths Warder!!! A citizen in distress!!! Come my faithful companion!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth springs into action, his huge body moving with a feline grace belying his enormous form&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Leaping across the street, weapons spring into his hands, as if from nowhere, and with lighting fast speed he leap straight for Pykk and Tibs&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk, Tibs and Lunitar watch the spectacle unfold in a shocked daze&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth's huge form flew across the street, snarling............. right into the wall next to Pykk&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The three men stood speechless as Notinth's huge armored form laid motionless on the ground beside them&gt;<br>
<br>
/Notinths Warder says/<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello fair adventures, please pardon my large friend here, He seems to have had an absorbident amount to drink this evening. So terribly sorry about all this&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The three men watch in shock as the largest tiger they have ever seen, helps the intoxicated Notinth up and helps him off into the night&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk turns and says&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;okay this has been the weirdest night I have ever had!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;He pulls at Tibs arm&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;common, lets go&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But what about the money??!!? And my revenge??&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk looks at Tibs with a blank expression on his face&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk kicks Tibs in the shin&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;come on weirdo&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk and Tibs walk off into the alley, Lunitar hears them talking&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;What in the heck are you talking about?? Revenge?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I think it adds something to our hold-ups, I mean it cant just be about the money!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummmmm, yes it can&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs fumbles in his tunic&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pykk!! can I have my wallet back?&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk hands Tibs's wallet back&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just practicing&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks, hey, have you noticed the mobs we have been killing have not had any money on them of late??&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk glances quickly at Tibs&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I have!! tis possible the recent decline in the economy is responsible my young friend!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;yes I suppose so, so when are you g...........&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;their voices trail off into the night&gt;<br>

<br>
“Man, I cant believe that the twins blew me off like that!! Sheeezzz, I guess I have to do some faction work!! God I hate that!! Hmmmm I wonder what faction they are on ?? They did seem to mention Narius the weak, maybe he knows them better. I think I will send him a tell.”<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk and Tibs look on as Lunitar stops in the street&gt;<br>
&lt;Tibs is the first to speak, softly&gt;<br>
“What is he doing?”<br>
“Bah!! I don’t know, looks like he might be afk?”<br>
“Should we take him now??”<br>
“No, just wait and see what happens”<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar stand motionless in the street&gt;<br>
<br>
you tell narius “Hello!! Do you happen to know the Twins?”<br>
<br>
Narius tells you “Hold one sec, getting ass kicked”<br>
<br>
&lt;two minutes pass&gt;<br>
<br>
you tell Narius “You all right?”<br>
<br>
&lt;another minute passes&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Suddenly a very naked Narius appears next to the bar&gt;<br>
<br>
“&amp;$%@$@#&amp;&amp;#@&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar approaches Narius&gt;<br>
<br>
Hail, Narius!!<br>
<br>
&lt;Narius looks to be in a very foul mood&gt;<br>
/Narius summons an undead companion/<br>
<br>
“GOBEKER!!! WHAT IN THE %$&amp;@ WERE YOU DOING!!”<br>
&lt;GOBEKER looks around confused&gt;<br>
{all I did was follow you down a hall!!}<br>
“You call THAT following me down a hall!! You ran around the whole outside of the zone and then right back to me with 13 mobs on your tail!!”<br>
{Its not my fault that pathing stinks!! Maybe you should walk different!!}<br>
“BAH!! Okay, we will talk about this later!!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Narius notices Lunitar standing in the lamplight&gt;<br>
&lt;Narius clears throat&gt;<br>
<br>
“Hail, Lunitar! Ummmm.. I heard your tell and thought I would just hop on by and see what you needed in person!!!<br>
&lt;GOBEKER glances at Narius&gt;<br>
{But I thought that 13 mobs just beat the living cra…..&gt;<br>
&lt;Narius kicks GOBEKER in the shin&gt;<br>
“YES!!! YES indeed good sir!! Just thought I would stop by!! What can I do for you?”<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar smiles evilly at Narius&gt;<br>
“ahhh, Narius, I need some information about the twins!!”<br>
&lt;Narius frowns&gt;<br>
“And why should I help you??”<br>
<br>
Taking a Screenshot…<br>
<br>
“ACK !! What are you doing!!!!”<br>
<br>
“Just some insurance that you will help me!! You would not want the twins getting a hold of this!! Let us just say that they might adopt a new nickname for you if they get a look at this!!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Narius’s shoulders slump&gt;<br>
<br>
“what information do you want?”<br>
<br>
“Ahh that is the easy part my friend!! I just need to know what faction the twins are on?”<br>
<br>
&lt;Narius ponder the question&gt;<br>
<br>
“Ahhh yes, I recall now!! They are on Woman faction.”<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar expression looks puzzled&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Narius looks sympathetic&gt;<br>
<br>
“Ahhh yes Lunitar, tis a difficult task I see before you for this faction is not easy to obtain!! It is actually a blending of factions that must all be increased in order to be able to group with them. The first one I would work on is the Merchants_of_Norath faction. This requires that you purchase several things from around Norath and turn them in to the twins. Keep in mind that the more plat that they cost, the higher the faction adjustment! Oh, and a word of warning, multi-questing these pieces will NOT work.”<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar continues taking notes in his spell book&gt;<br>
<br>
“The next faction I would work on is the  Cult_of_Conversation faction. This faction involves the actual correspondence between you and the twins, in other words,  you have to send them tells with key phrases in them to activate the next line of the script. These phrases include things such as, [don’t worry, I’m sure its your jeans that shrunk], [no, I don’t mind if we go see The Divine Secrets of the YA-YA Sisterhood, in fact, I have been looking forward to it], and [of course you look better than her, she does not hold a candle to you baby] these key phrases will advance you down the path you are interested in going.”<br>
<br>
&lt;From the alley Pykk and Tibs listen to the strange meeting taking place&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs looks at Pykk confused&gt;<br>
<br>
“What in the hell is the YA-YA Sisterhood?”<br>
<br>
“I think they are a group in Mistmoore, but i'm not sure’<br>
&lt;Pykk motions for Tibs to be quiet&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;an hour passes&gt;<br>
<br>
“And finally there is the faction with The_Inlaws, you are on your own with this faction as I have no clue how to increase that. No matter what I do they just Scowl at me Ready to Attack. I think I ruined my faction with that “big juggs” comment during a dinner at their house, I had to feign death just to make it out alive. So there you go my friend, good luck on your quest!!”<br>
<br>
&lt;With that Narius disappears into the shadows and is gone&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar looks about ready to cry&gt;<br>
<br>
“Good god!! This will be harder than keeping a Ranger alive in a guild raid!!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Lunitar sighs and walks slowly back toward home&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk and Tibs look on from the shadows&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs looks at Pykk&gt;<br>
<br>
“Aren’t we going to get his plat??”<br>
<br>
“Nah, that poor bastard is trying to raise his faction with the Twins!! He will need it all and more just for the Merchants_of_Norath faction. I feel sorry for the guy.”<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs just shakes is head&gt;<br>
<br>
“Then I will never get my revenge……”<br>
<br>
&lt;Pykk looks at Tibs&gt;<br>
<br>
“I think you should lay off the cough syrup man……… Seriously….. “<br>

&quot;Did you see our grand battle??&quot; asked the Captain of the Guard. &quot;He killed 2 of our brethren (he lied, it was really 5), and it took 3 more of us to do it. But we laid WASTE to him!&quot;<br>

Valaura and Selah look at each other, and then disbelievingly at the length and power of the iksar's blade. It was like nothing they had ever seen.<br>

<br>
&lt;A year goes by&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs sits alone in the ally thinking to himself&gt;<br>
<br>
“I’m getting no where fast, what I need is a REAL rogue! That way revenge will be mine finally!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Out in the street, a lone horse passes by, a young rider sits in the saddle, her hair eyes barley a glint beneath the cowl of her hood&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs watches on in fascination when suddenly, 5 men move out from the bushes and block the horses path, 3 more take up station behind the horse preventing escape&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Thug_01 casts a quick glance at his mate&gt;<br>
<br>
{Thank goodness for this new raid feature! Now we can have more than 6 people in our party! Makes it much easier!}<br>
<br>
&lt;Thug_04 kicks Thug_01 in the shin&gt;<br>
<br>
{Shut-up! We are supposed to be performing a robbery here!}<br>
<br>
&lt;Bandit_leader_01 looks the rider up and down, smirking&gt;<br>
<br>
{What have we here? Tis a bit dark out to be doing laundry honey!}<br>
<br>
&lt;The group of thugs snickers&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs moves to the end of the ally to get a better view&gt;<br>
<br>
“What a witty remark! Your casual banter and delightful sense of humor must surly mean that you are the leader of this fine group of men!”<br>
<br>
&lt;The group of men look around slightly confused, caught off guard by the fearless tone and self confidence in the woman’s voice&gt;<br>
<br>
{I am the leader of the crimson claw! We own this road and demand tribute for its use!!}<br>
&lt;The men shout out their agreement with their leader, voices piercing the night&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The young woman leans back in her saddle comfortably, hands resting on the pummel of the saddle&gt;<br>
<br>
“hmmmm, That’s funny, I thought the city owned the roads and paid for their maintenance out of taxes from the local population in an effort to maintain open trade routes with neibohring cities. To allow individuals to own separate sections of the road and tax them anyway the saw fit would seem out of character with the local statutes. But of course I have not spoken with the local authorities in quite some time”<br>
<br>
&lt;The young female giggles to herself&gt;<br>
<br>
“Yes, it has been quite some time since they have even seen me! Hehe”<br>
<br>
&lt;The group of men look around at each other confused and then look to their leader&gt;<br>
<br>
“Surely you would not be suggesting that I pay you for the use of roads that are free for all to travel would you?”<br>
<br>
&lt;The young female removes her hood, the moon shines off her hair, her eyes bore into the Bandit leaders surly form&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Bandit_leader_01 takes a faltering step back and glances at his men&gt;<br>
<br>
{Bah!! Rules be damned! Its not really your plat we are after! We have been sent for you! We will have you the easy way or the hard way! It is your choice!!}<br>
<br>
&lt;The group of men tense visibly, In the corner of the ally, Tibs gets out his fire beetle eye and readies his sword&gt;<br>
<br>
“Well….. If I get to choose….. I pick…..”<br>
<br>
&lt;The young riders eyes sparkle with  mischief&gt;<br>
<br>
“The hard way!!”<br>
<br>
&lt;The Bandit leader takes a step forward and looks very surprised as a dagger sprouts from his chest, Bandit_leader_01 stumbles forward, shocked, and slumps to the ground in front of the horse&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The thugs look around at each other shocked and then rush in to attack&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs had not even see the woman throw the dagger! He shook himself and rushes from the ally&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The young rider vaults straight up from her horse doing a somersault to land with cat like grace in front of it, crouching low with two silvery blades in her hand&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The thugs reach the horse only to find its rider was no longer there and their number decreased by two more as the riders daggers found their mark in mid somersault&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The thugs slowly move in and circle the woman&gt;<br>
<br>
{You have some moves little girl! But now let me show you mine!!}<br>
<br>
&lt;Letting out a battle cry, the thug rushes in toward the young woman&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Smiling and humming to herself, the young rider, parries mighty blow, sweeping around the thug in a flourish, her blade tracing an arc behind her around the thugs neck&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The four thugs look shocked as the strange ballet ends in the demise of another one of their companions, shouting they rush in&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;crouching low the young rider smiles and tumbles to the left, dodging the 4 men with ease&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The four men skid to a stop and whirl around&gt; <br>
<br>
&lt;Suddenly one of them shrieks&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Vines snake up like living creatures entangling themselves around the thugs legs, rooting him in place&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The other 3 thugs look around in fear when suddenly one of them busts into flames!&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Panic strikes the thugs, and they break for the woods, the young riders blade finding its way home as one thug runs past&gt;<br>
<br>
“Hehe, didn’t your mom ever tell you? Never turn your back on a rogue! Haha”<br>
<br>
&lt;The last thug runs off into the night screaming as a stinging swarm of deadly insects follows him into the night&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs stepped out of the shadows and walked carefully over to the young rider&gt;<br>
<br>
“I was wondering when you would lend a hand!” <br>
<br>
&lt;the female rogue beams a smile at Tibs, and wipes the blood from her blades&gt;<br>
<br>
“Well, ummm, truthfully, it did not seem like you needed one…”<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs smiles at the young woman&gt;<br>
<br>
“My name is Tiberiussirk, but my friends call me Tibs, what is your name fair one?”<br>
<br>
“My name is Noot, it is a pleasure to meet you Tibs! Thank you for helping, I know I could have taken them, but grouping is MUCH more fun!!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs glances over at the sniveling thug, covered in vines&gt;<br>
<br>
“what about this one?”<br>
<br>
&lt;Noot glances at the thug and grins evily&gt;<br>
<br>
“Well, I do need to practice my poison skill, lets have some fun and find out who sent them”<br>
<br>
&lt;grinning at each other, the two move in on the trapped thug&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Meanwhile on the outskirts of the City, in a small apartment, a loud crash is heard&gt;<br>
&lt;Notinth’s warder lifts his head off his paws and glances toward the bathroom&gt;<br>
<br>
/Notinth’s warder says/<br>
<br>
”Good evening my large companion! How was your rest this day?”<br>
<br>
&lt;A low moan can be heard coming from beyond the door&gt;<br>
<br>
/Notinth’s warder says/ <br>
<br>
“Tis unfortunate that you are not feeling well, perhaps it was the rather large quantity of Nip that was consumed yesterday evening? Might I make a small suggestion? Perhaps restricting your evenings consumption to 7 or 8 glasses may, perhaps, avoid this unfortunate side effect which plagues you at this time.”<br>
<br>
&lt;A low moan comes from the bathroom again….&gt;<br>
<br>
/Notinth’s warder sighs/ <br>
<br>
“Ahh well, I have dinner prepared for you none the less, come out and get some food in your stomach, that will surly help!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth stumbles out of the bathroom, his huge form looking very intimidating had it not been for the bunny slippers&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth slumps down into his chair and stares at his plate of food for a short time&gt;<br>
<br>
“Bah! Nothing ever happens in this town! I need adventure!! Excitement! We have not had anything exciting since the fall of Draz Nurakk where I got my claws!” <br>
<br>
/Notinth’s warder comforts Notinth/<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry my friend, your valiant deeds have traveled far and wide and Shar Vahl still speaks of your name in honor for all you have done, all accept for the bar keep there where you ran up the tab and trashed the place that is.”<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth perks up&gt;<br>
<br>
“That was not my fault!! They started it! I was defending my honor!!”<br>
<br>
/Notinth’s warder says/ <br>
<br>
“Well, I suppose you are correct, I am sure that that man totally overreacted when you threw the dart and missed and plugged him in the posterior”<br>
<br>
“Yes!! Yes he did! Like I said before, I stumbled and my aim was off!!!”<br>
<br>
/Notinth’s warder says/ <br>
<br>
“Yes, Yes, my large friend, I’m sure accidents do happen and …..&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth’s warder suddenly tenses, his ears twitch. He sniffs the air, hair standing up on his back&gt;<br>
<br>
“Yes! Yes accidents DO happen, that is what I was trying to explaining to him when he insulted my mother! So you see of course what I had too..”<br>
/Notinth’s warder growls/<br>
<br>
“My large friend I believe we are about to have company”<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth looks up from his plate of food just in time to see the door to the apartment come crashing down&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth’s warder lets out a growl and meets the intruder in mid air, tackling him to the floor and parrying the short sword aside&gt;<br>
<br>
“Eeegad! We are under attack!!  I must get to my gear!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth’s warder rolls to the right, raking another with is huge claws as they try to gain access to the apartment threw the door, leather armor and blood spray across the room&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth leaps to his feet just as another figure swings into the window shattering the glass, the figure draws two blades that glow faintly&gt;<br>
<br>
“Ack! What is this! How dare you interrupt my meal!”<br>
<br>
&lt;screams continue behind him, as Notinth’s warder continues to wreck havoc at the door to the apartment&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The intruder at the window crouches and is about to spring, but is caught by surprise and knocked back out the window as a bunny slipper is launched at him&gt;<br>
<br>
“Damn! That was a good set of slippers!”<br>
<br>
&lt;The sounds of glass shattering are heard from behind the bedroom door, Notinth glances over at his warder&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;the bodies are stacked on either side of the door, Notinth’s warder is holding his own against 3 dark figures, signs of the struggle are starting to show on his friend&gt;<br>
<br>
“you okay?”<br>
<br>
/Notinth’s warder says/ <br>
<br>
“Do not worry about me, my large friend! Grab your gear and let us make haste!”<br>
<br>
&lt;One of the dark figures lounges forward slashing a dark red groove into Notinth’s warder’s shoulder&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth’s warder roars with anger and catches the withdrawing figures arm between his teeth, snapping it like a twig&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth Barrels into the bedroom, letting out a huge roar&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;A large figure stands behind 4 men, from beneath his cloak, dark glittering metal, is visible&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;the four men moved forward while the dark figure watched on&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth glances his weapons in the corner of the room, a feint glow surrounding the razor sharp blades, gifts of Elder Animist Dunal for defeating the Dark animist Draz Nurakk&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth crouches low, sounds of battle still coming from the front room&gt;<br>
<br>
“So, I don’t suppose one of you would like to toss me my weapons would ya?”<br>
<br>
&lt;the 4 men spring into action, blades whistling&gt;<br>
<br>
“Nope, I didn’t think so”<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinths razor sharp claws catch the first intruder across the chest in a mighty swipe, sending the figure crashing to the ground. Letting his momentum carry him around, Notinth brings his leg up swiftly catching the next thug in the face with his clawed foot&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The thug falls to the floor, screaming and clutching his face, the remaining two move in, blades weaving&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth, dodges the blade of the first figure and parries the second. As he straightens back out, Notinth brings his elbow around sharply into the skull of the second figure causing him to slump to the floor&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;the remaining thug, looks at Notinth nervously, and then toward the figure in black, in the back of the room&gt;<br>
<br>
“What, you need his permission to die?? Hehehe”<br>
<br>
&lt;The thug drops his weapons and starts running toward the window&gt;<br>
<br>
“Bah! Party pooper!”<br>
<br>
&lt;The fleeing Thug suddenly stops running, as shadows coalesce into a solid substance, binding his movement to but a crawl&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The dark strangers gauntleted hands glow as he mutters strange incantations under his breath. Suddenly the shadows begin to drip like blood from the walls and rush toward the clung figure. The darkness engulfs the man, seeping into his skin, the figure screams and writhes on the floor, falling silent in but a moment&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The dark stranger laughs and says in a deep voice&gt;<br>
<br>
“Ahhh, that is one of my favorites, although, wasted on one so young. Normally they scream for quite some time.”<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth lunges toward the figure uttering a low growl&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;The stranger’s sword flies into life, a large dark blade, glowing purple, small skulls flow out from the hilt from the souls of the fallen&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth parries the sword aside, raking his claws across the break in the armor between the chestplate and the helm, the dark stranger staggers back, bringing up his knee and knocks Notinth back across the room, dark whispers can be heard, and Notinth is enveloped in a sickly green aura&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth roars in pain and feels his life force drain away as the wound on the dark strangers neck heals&gt;<br>
<br>
“Not bad, Not bad at all!”<br>
<br>
&lt;the dark stranger says&gt; <br>
<br>
“My master may be correct after all!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Suddenly a great roar is heard from the front room&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Notinth whirls around and dashes for the bedroom door. The shadows move in from the walls, slowing Notinth, he spins around just as the strangers sword crashes into his head. Darkness decends………..&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;back in the countryside, Noot and Tibs sit around a fire, cooking dinner&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Noot smiles at Tibs&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs stirs the rabbit stew and places some more vegetables in it&gt;<br>
<br>
“Where did you get the vegetables?”<br>
<br>
“Ummm I found them”<br>
<br>
&lt;Noot licks her lips&gt;<br>
<br>
“well, okay, it smells good at least” <br>
<br>
“I wonder what they were talking about, being after me and all.”<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs slowly stirs his creation&gt;<br>
<br>
“Im not sure, but I would love to help you find out, I wonder who the cat and the twins were that he was talking about and why they want all of you?”<br>
<br>
&lt;Noot looks off into the distance&gt;<br>
<br>
“Im not sure Tibs, but rest assured they will make another attempt on me, so I must find out what is going on. We have to try and find the others to warn them about this plot! We can set off at first light!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Tibs fumbles in his tunic&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Noot!! can I have my wallet back?&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Noot hands Tibs's wallet back&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just practicing&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Back in town, on the opposite side, light pours out of an apartment window&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Valaura stretches and snuggles up next to the fire with her book while Selah works on her tailoring under the lamplight&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Valaura looks up from her book&gt;<br>
<br>
“Well, I must say its great to get a night off!”<br>
<br>
&lt;Selah looks up from her tailoring&gt;<br>
<br>
“Bah! I have to get my skill up with this! Its driving me crazy! I just wish that I…….wait…. did you hear that?”<br>
<br>
&lt;The twins listen closely when suddenly the door bursts open and dark figures rush into the room&gt;<br>

&lt;Selah begins to cast a spell&gt;<br>
you have entered your apartment<br>
The twins sighed in unison. They are clearly disappointed. &quot;we really should stop binding here on our nights off&quot; said Selah<br>
The dark figures rushed swiftly into the room to surround the twins. In a moment they were gone, and the twins were taken. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=2.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm11.showNextMessage?topicID=2.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm11.emailToFriend?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm11.threadControl?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub2.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension87012frm21">Board FAQ's<option value="ascension87012frm2">News and Views<option value="ascension87012frm4">Rules<option value="ascension87012frm5">Raids<option value="ascension87012frm6">Recruitment<option value="ascension87012frm10">Roster<option value="ascension87012frm11">Roleplay<option value="ascension87012frm19">Marketplace<option value="ascension87012frm14">Guild Discussion<option value="ascension87012frm7">Guild Events<option value="ascension87012frm9">Guild Raids<option value="ascension87012frm8">Guild Groups<option value="ascension87012frm12">Guild Treasury<option value="ascension87012frm20">Quest Information<option value="ascension87012frm13">Confidential Matters<option value="ascension87012frm15">Officer Discussion<option value="ascension87012frm16">General Archives<option value="ascension87012frm18">Guild Archives<option value="ascension87012frm17">Council Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/bascension87012>Ascension Alliance Forums</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fascension87012frm11>Roleplay</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://ascension_eq.tripod.com/">Ascension Alliance Home</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
