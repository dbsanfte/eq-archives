<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0"><strong>Original Charter</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">This charter was originally written buy the first 10 founding members of this
guild.&nbsp; the charter was written for Everquest's world. but with a&nbsp;
small amount of modification can be any world. as the guild grows out of the
single game single server realm we will move to a single code of conduct that
will be universal. All wolves will be of one mind and spirit when it comes to
their conduct with others and each other. anyway here is the original charter.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">It is rumored that long ago there was a clan. They were a clan that stood for
honor and justice. They defended the weak and hunted the wicked. They were known
as the Wolves of Norrath. Since those days the Wolves have been forgotten, yet
their names are still whispered throughout the most remote regions of Norrath.
Unfortunately, their once proud name was now only used when describing a threat
to small children to get them to finish their meals or to get to their beds at
night. &quot;Mind me, or the Wolves will get you!&quot; Well the world of
Norrath has changed much. Racism and persecution could be seen like a virus
engulfing all of Norrath. There seemed to be no one who remembered the ideals
and beliefs of the original Wolves. This was seen by several young and
idealistic adventurers, and they decided that the revival of the Wolves of yore
would be the best way to help rid the land of this vile threat. They decided
that instead of just standing by and watching it further engulf Norrath, that
they would do something about it. This was the day the Aegis Wolves were born.
These brash youngsters decided to live by the old ways. They founded the Aegis
Wolves with the same tenants and ideals the original Wolves.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">Like Wolves, they have few rules, but the rules that they have are to be
taken seriously and upheld by the guild members to their best ability.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">1. Religious beliefs can and will be kept to personal choice. However members
with opposing beliefs will keep them secondary to their membership in the Aegis
Wolves, in order to keep inside conflict to a minimum.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">2. Members are to protect each other from danger. If a member is seen to be
in danger, do not hesitate to offer assistance to the member. The exception to
this is if the person tells you otherwise. &quot;Kill stealing&quot; is looked
down upon, especially with other member’s kills.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">3. All members must do their best to represent the guild in good light. This
requires that they try, to the best of their ability, to follow the guild’s
charter. This rule is especially true when traveling with people out side the
guild. If they see the behavior of the member, they may want to join the
member's guild.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">4. Never do anything to bring dishonor to the guild. This will include, but
is not limited to, &quot;Kill Stealing&quot;, Stealing from members, bug
abusing, and irritating/inappropriate behavior to others. These actions could
result in in disciplinary action up to and including removal from the guild.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">5. All members of the guild will be considered trustworthy. This is what the
Aegis Wolves were founded on. If they are a member of the Aegis Wolves they are
your brothers/sisters in arms. Trust them as you would trust yourself. If a
member is found to be untrustworthy then it will be handled at that time. And in
a manner appropriate to the breach of trust.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">6. The Aegis Wolves will not discriminate against any race or class. In this
guild, it is a common sight to see a High Elf Paladin fighting alongside a Dark
Elf Necromancer. As long as the person proves to be a loyal and valued member
they are welcome to join the Aegis Wolves.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">7. The Aegis Wolves are a role-playing guild. As such all members of the
Aegis Wolves will develop a character and must try to stay in character while
playing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 17; margin-right: 34; margin-top: 0">8. Guild Wars. Guild Wars can only be initiated by a 50% vote of the of the
Elder Wolves Council. Once the Elder Wolves vote to begin such a war notice must
be sent immediately to all members. All members must be notified at least 24
hours in advance.</p>
