Don't miss this chance <BR>to see the latest and greatest upcoming features in the world of <BR>Norrath!<BR><BR>Registration for the event closes on June 4! Hurry and reserve your spot! <BR>Visit http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/ to register or for <BR>more information!<BR><BR><BR>*** Message about our Guide Program ***<BR><BR><BR>Hail citizens of Norrath!<BR><BR>Hear my words, for I bring news of great importance.<BR><BR>Today I present to you an adventure, perhaps the greatest the Lands <BR>of Norrath have ever offered. It is a quest of great proportions, and <BR>a journey fraught with danger. Fear not though my friends, for the <BR>spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.<BR><BR>As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect <BR>and serve the lands of Norrath. Scribes are lining up even now so that <BR>they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.<BR><BR>We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with <BR>compassion, and filled with joy.<BR><BR>If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, <BR>or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly <BR>the adventure for you. Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could <BR>bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens. Maybe your renowned <BR>acting skills might be of help. If you are kind, compassionate, and <BR>helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<BR><BR>If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be <BR>difficult at times. You can be assured that you will be tried... <BR>and hopefully you will be found true. In the end though, the citizens <BR>of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the <BR>lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.<BR><BR>If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite <BR>you to point your browser to: http://guideapp.everquest.com<BR><BR>We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to <BR>Norrath are grand.<BR><BR>A few things to remember:<BR>1) You must have an active EverQuest account in good standing.<BR>2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<BR>3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<BR>4) You will need good communication skills.<BR>5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<BR>6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.<BR><BR><BR>Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better <BR>than they already are... come be a part of the EverQuest Guide <BR>Program!<BR><BR>- The EverQuest Guide Program<BR><BR><BR>*** Important Reminder ***<BR><BR>Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small <BR>chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch. GMs will <BR>have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost. That means that <BR>they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one. It is also <BR>important to understand that attempting to scam a GM about a lost <BR>corpse could mean banning from EverQuest.<BR><BR>** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM <BR>ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **<BR><BR>We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time. <BR>In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a <BR>problem. Don't wait. If you are worried about a corpse that you were <BR>unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in and check on it <BR>right away after the patch.<BR><BR>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned <BR>up as possible before the next patch. We're not expecting a lot of <BR>corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of <BR>them disappearing.<BR><BR>Thanks.<BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team<BR><BR><BR>*** Patch Message ***<BR><BR><BR>** Zone Changes **<BR><BR>- Runnyeye has been changed. Something is up in Goblin land...<BR><BR><BR>** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<BR><BR>- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code. For the most <BR>part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to <BR>stack that were never intended to stack.<BR><BR>- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<BR><BR>- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of <BR>Cazic Thule can scribe it.<BR><BR>- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been <BR>changed to be more appropriate.<BR><BR><BR>** Features and Interface Changes **<BR><BR>- The variable %t will now work with /assist. So you can use /assist %t <BR>if you wish. Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist <BR>without the %t.<BR><BR>- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.<BR><BR>- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to <BR>user color 15 (same as other skill messages). The success message <BR>was already set to user color 15.<BR><BR>- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does. <BR>It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server. The new <BR>ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list <BR>(_<#>.ini). The first time a character is created or <BR>loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old <BR>ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.<BR><BR>- The Alt key now works in several new situations. It will now show <BR>item names when in the trade window. Because the trade items of the <BR>local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item <BR>names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player <BR>positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade <BR>window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade <BR>item names.<BR><BR>- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.<BR><BR>- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse <BR>items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.<BR><BR>- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when <BR>held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they <BR>don't show up otherwise).<BR><BR>- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any <BR>player that is on your /ignore list. Some players were using this <BR>to annoy players that had ignored them.<BR><BR>- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are <BR>on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to <BR>annoy people that had ignored them).<BR><BR>- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the <BR>members of your guild in your zone. You can also specify a guild name, <BR>such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".<BR><BR>- /safelock command added. /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface <BR>(mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash <BR>commands) with the password that you supply to the command. You must use <BR>this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the <BR>interface. Passwords are NOT case-sensitive. So to lock your interface, <BR>you would type /safelock password. You would do the same to unlock it. <BR>REMEMBER: If you forget what password you typed, you will need to <BR>reboot your machine.<BR><BR><BR>** Item Changes **<BR><BR>- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now <BR>also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<BR><BR>- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.<BR><BR>- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of <BR>your waist.<BR><BR>- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop. <BR>They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <BR><BR>- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable. <BR>There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so <BR>we had to disable that for these items.<BR><BR>- Sewing Kits: No existing sewing kits are being changed with this <BR>patch. But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different. <BR>Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots. Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 <BR>slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.<BR><BR>- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty <BR>blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.<BR><BR><BR>** Other Stuff **<BR><BR>- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level <BR>bard title. :)<BR><BR>- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with <BR>that of his counterparts in Velious. This is not the sort of thing <BR>that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that <BR>nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest. We're <BR>announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.<BR><BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team<BR><BR><br></p></td><tr><tr><td background="img/purpback.gif"><img src="img/purpback.gif" width=1 height=10></td>
