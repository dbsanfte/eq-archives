Eh, I agree. Verant should fix it if they don't want us to use it. However, I was just stating what a GM will tell you and what they normally go by. Do I think it's right? no. But that's how it goes.

Necros use pathing to their advantage no matter where they fear kite. I know I personally prefer to know where that mob is going to path when I fear it. Just because a certain place gives pathing that is greatly to our advantage compared to others shouldn't mean it's an exploit, but verant thinks so. (would that make south karana, iceclad, eastern wastes, etc... quad kiting exploit areas since it is so much easier there as oposed..say..skyfire?../shrug)</P><P>Was just giving the guy a warning to watch out for things like that. I did the pathing thing in the BW giant fort when they gave me good exp. If I had been "caught" I may have gotten a warning, but I would have bitched to every verant e-mail, snailmail, and telephone number I could find about it. If you don't care either, then go ahead and do it. However, if you do care and don't feel like the confrontation, then it may be best to avoid those places.</P><P>EDIT: yea..I knew one guy who got suspended there (he already had one other warning on his account for the same exact thing. Heh, his other warning was for a massive train they deemed intentional. Amazingly enough it wasn't)</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=264137" target="_blank" target="_blank">Charbonez Soulmark</a><BR>Clan Doomit<BR>Duzzil Ro</P><P></P><P>Edited by - charbonez on 09/30/2002  07:48:29</font></td>

Don't accept the warning, you need to challenge it, you can't just take that, because next time anything questionable comes up about you, if they check that warning, you automatically lose the benefit of the doubt.  You'll need to talk to an actual GM in order to get the warning removed.  Also report the guide to <a href="mailto:eqcs@soe.sony.com,">eqcs@soe.sony.com,</a> and just let them know that he gave you a warning for something legitimate, and explain the circumstances.

Think about that.  If you know where you can fear a mob safely so that it doesn't aggro others, that's no more an exploit than running back and forth where it doesn't aggro others.  If you use that information to your advantage (since you're exploiting the fact that every mob will run the same way, and not toward help), you *must* be exploiting, as a *real* creature would run *toward* its friends.  Therefore, any use of fear that doesn't result in adds when there are adds around, is an exploit.</P><P> </font></td>

It started when me and my friends wiped out in hands in KC from a bad pull and within 10 minutes of being rezzed, another group took it upon theirself to claim our camp saying we had never called the camp despite having been in hands for 2 hours prior to the wipe.  Well regardless, our groups shared some words and we moved back into the camp and watched them wipeout in T2 while trying to break back into the camp we were already sitting in again.  They gave us a few more choice words and then set up camp in LCY hoping to pull the mobs while weren't looking.  I was the puller for our group and had been pulling any and all un-claimed camps/mobs since we had started that camp, but because of their "cock-block" I now was limited to what I could pull.  I decided I wasn't going to sit here and have my group's exp hindered, sitting around for 30 minutes waiting for respawns, when the zone only had 15 people (our group of 4 in hands, their group of 6 in LCY, and a few random LFG's/solo'ers) in it at the time.  So I started trying to pull through their camp.  Believe me, I know how to pull through a group, I can get a mob where I want it 99% of the time...even if people are in my way.  So anyway, they start mezzing/charming my pulls as I go through.  I'm not sure which, but the effect remained the same.

I never felt that showing others's faults is excusing ours."</P><P>2) Note that I didn't mention anyone, I didn't quote anyone, I just said what I was feeling. Don't tell me nobody is pointing at Druids each time something is unfair with our class. Anyway, some of us keep on remind others that class envy (classwide in this case) isn't the best way to have our problems looked at.</P><P><BR>I am not willing to mention anyone...</P><P><center><img src="http://www.ifrance.com/Coercitas/Coer_Bob_Nerfed.jpg" border=0></center></font></td>

I say the proper words to get him to give me the portion of the quest I'm working on.  He tells me what I need to give him, so I give him the head and talisman gleaned from the tastmasker earlier.<BR>He EATS my stuff, saying that he won't help me.<BR>Bullshit.  Total and utter bullshit.  If the guy will tell you about the quest, he should give you the reward, right?  That's what I figure, so I petition.<BR>6 hours later, I get a tell from a guide that my petition has *just* been elevated to someone who can actually help me.  Guild decided to rinwar again (I would have just killed the damed taskmaster if he'd been up after the NPC ate my stuff) so after that the zone was repop'd.  Killed the bastard again and logged off.<BR>8.5 hours after I petitioned, I recieved nothing in the way of a helpful response at all.  This is NOT customer service, assholes.</P><P>Jered Caladine<BR>Warlock of Forlorn<BR>E'ci Server<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22847" target="_blank">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22847</a></font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> We take different approaches to things we see that we belive to be wrong and in our dealings with people. I prefer the direct approach and speak directly to the person I feel needs to be corrected. You prefer to make broad generalizations to avoid direct confrontation. Both have their pros and cons. /shrug differences in personalities..go figure.</P><P>I didn't say people don't make cracks at druids on this board. Of course someone will point a finger at druids every so often, but it doesn't happen in every single case, and many times it's just as a reference. Sometimes it's much easier to use other classes as a basis for comparison. In order to teach a dog to sit, you don't give him a treat every time he stands up, you give him a treat when he sits down. When you housebreak a llama, you don't beat it for sitting on the toilet, you beat it for pissing on grandma's rug. When someone makes a statement blaming druids, you tell them it's not the druid's fault. When someone makes a joke about druids being stupid, then you laugh or groan depending on how lame his attempt was (or her, don't want to leave the ladies out)</P><P>If someone decides to make a humorous sarcastic remark, then that is their right as much as it's your right to make broad and sweeping generalizations. Just as it's my right to make direct quotes when I feel something was said that had no bearing on the current conversation. Just as it's my right to now be hypocritical and change the entire context of this whole thread.</P><P>You see?</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=264137" target="_blank" target="_blank">Charbonez Soulmark</a><BR>Clan Doomit<BR>Duzzil Ro</font></td>
