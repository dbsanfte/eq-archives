Everyone raves about how HP is the prime stat for us Necro's. Say why? This topic was inspired by the AA thread, where people seemed to agree that "Natural durability hands down should be your first choice, its raised my hp a ton"...

I challange anyone to give me a good reason to get HP gear over, say, FT gear, or +Mana gear, or Resist gear. What is HP good for? Only a couple things:

#1. Raiding
#2. Tanking
#3. Lifeburn
#4. Oh wait.. that's all there is.

So, unless you're a Necro who does nothing but raid, tank summoning mobs, or if Lifeburn is #1 priority for you, then [b]HP IS NOT IMPORTANT[/b]. Me, I don't raid much right now (fucking aa grind), I don't tank mobs because fear-kiting is the most efficient way to get exp, and I don't Lifeburn because I don't have the ability yet (3 points away!). So unless you can come up with other reasons why I would even need HP gear, let alone waste 12 points on ND3, you heard the truth here first.

Gear goes like this FT > Regen > HP > Mana. Throw in resists, depending on what items you get.

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> I didn't start heavily building my HP gear before 55. Between 49 and 52 I had around 900 hp... below 55 I still had 1200 or so. I used to die. A lot. I'm talking 5-6 times a day. After reading a lot of threads on the subject on this board, I started thinking about reasons I'd get hp gear. this was before lifeburn even came out mind you, and at the time I was not in a raiding guild, and I'd never thought of ever being able to solo summoning mobs. What I came up with as reasons for HP concentartion didn't even come close to what you listed. Things which convinced me to start looking into hp gear:</P><P>1) Health Aggro. In groups, AND in my favourite solo spots at the time I was finding it very hard to keep from getting low health aggro due to lich. I'd either have to constantly tap or use ... *shudder* C2 ... 800 hp doesn't go far when you have lich up. Get down to about 40 percent life, and guess what... mobs start coming after you. Mobs that won't aggro because they're too green WILL aggro you due to low health. All the int in the world can't save you if you can't even take the 1 or 2 hits it'll take to get another root off in an enclosed space. FD? Well yeah, but I prefer not to spend most of my time waiting for mobs to wander away.</P><P>2) Charmies. For a while I was rather enamoured of the thrall of bones spell. I still am. I use it a LOT when grouping, especially if we've a backup healer and/or a general surplus of mana (Kei, whatever). An augmented, even normal charmed pet you toss a proccing weapon on can be a mean addition to an XP group. Generally I use pets that can lay out between 120 and 170 dmg a hit. If I only had 800 or 900 hp (base) I'd go down in the blink of an eye if charm broke at a bad time. An interesting note on this, an int/charisma chanter friend of mine of comparable level at the time saw how much damage my charmed pet was doing, and gave it a shot in the same group. Half an hour and 4 resses later, he decided to leave it to the person with double his HP (me).</P><P>3) Duoing/Healing. I found the later 50s (55-60) stultifyingly boring. Soloing it was beginning to wear on my mind, I was finding myself doing stupider and stupider things to try to break the boredom. So eventually I started mixing it up and duoing with a monk friend. We could easily hold bk/captain/tunnel in chard, a significant number of guards in katta, etc. Mind you, stuff I could probably solo, but w/ a partner it's a) more fun, b) faster, c) safer. Don't have to worry about any repops while medding, etc. My job was basically tap, pet, pact (and slow any undead). I could keep this up nonstop pretty much, no down time. There were times however where I would have to pact 2 or even 3 times without having the mana to tap back (Ex: on nameds, etc). I couldn't do that unless I'd had at least marginal investment in hp gear.</P><P>4) Risky transit. Not really a 'need' per se, but I find that when moving through hostile territory, with the occasional undead and see invis thing (usually when they're surrounded by 3-4 casters), a little extra health where taking a hit is unavoidabable helps.</P><P>5) What else am I gonna get serious use out of. Never out of mana anyway. Well, I take that back. I've been oom in a grinding group twice in the last month. For about 20 seconds each. Usually when the puller brings so many the chanter can't mez them all before I already find myself soloing one or two of 'em. If I'm not gonna spend the gearslots on hp gear, what am I gonna do? Spend it on int and +mana so I can *cough* twitch? OH OH !! *POINT!* <b>I noticed you play on a zek, so yeah resist gear would be a good idea for you.</b> For most bluebie players though it's an almost total waste. I can get my resists up to 120+ each and mobs 30 to 40 levels below me still land for full. Flowing thought and Regen are a no brainer to want as a primary consideration, but seriously, I can name maybe two FT items off the top of my head that I'd ever have a hope in hell of seeing that aren't already an improvement hp/sta wise.</P><P>I've played the no hp gear necro. While my current total isnt' stellar, I'd never go back to the 900 or so I'd have at 60 with just base int and mana items. Been there, done that. Died too many times with a full bar of mana, just 'cause I couldn't live long enough to feign/get a tap off.</P><P>That having been said, to each their own. You do play on a zek, so your resists must be high. I don't, so I prefer my hp high. I know necros on my same server who have 1000 hp tops and are perfectly happy. There is no 'best' equipment, merely 'best equipment for your playstyle'.</P><P></P><P> </font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> I somewhat agree with the original post.  Mana regen determines kill rate, not hp. Arch brings in a fixed amount of mana.  Having more or less hp does not alter that.  So NO, more hps does not mean more mana per unit time.  When I consider more mana, I am thinking rates and not overall.</P><P>If I root/dot multiples, I value FT more than hp.  This is assuming you have some decent skills and hardly get hit.  Anywhere close to 2,000 hp buffed is more than plenty.</P><P>Now if I charm solo, then I prefer more hps because I know that charm will break every now and then and I need to be able to take some hits.  Also when you charm kill, you hardly use mana.</P><P>So it really comes down to how you like to play.  Root/dotting or fear kiting I prefer mana regen over hps.  I rarely get hit and in order to keep up a rate of about a blue in about 10 mins, I am killing more than 1 mob at a time.</P><P>If I charm, I switch to more hps. </P><P>I think he was just pointing out that many people blindly believe that hp is king.

I realize this is probably a common thread, but I'm not really a necromancer.  I'm a cleric with a necromancer twink (Which I play badly, I'll admit).</P><P>My question is... you cite that HP are more important than mana because hit points allow you to create mana, but even the highest level lich spells are below a 1:1 ration, correct?  If this is the case, then you're actually trading more hit points to get less mana, especially if you factor in the cost of lifetapping those hit points back up, and no matter how much you work that math, you end up better off just having a sufficient pool of hit points to work your liche and then focusing on mana entirely.  </P><P>For example, if at level 53 I transfer 720 hit points into 450 mana (Lich, which I have listed at 20 mana for 32 hit points or .625 ratio), then spend 360 mana casting BOD to heal those hit points back with BOD, then my net gain is only 90 hit points over three and a half minutes or so.  My standing regen with KEI should net me more than that, shouldn't it?  I realize that I've dealt some damage to the mob in exchange for those 90 hit points and that specialization will reduce my costs somewhat, but for the additional mana I could probably drop BOD for a more efficient DOT.</P><P>Am I missing something here?  Are your mana conversion spells actually greater than a 1:1 ratio?  When I'm playing my necro I know that it feels like I'm actually gaining more mana than that, but I haven't done any hard testing. I apologize if I've missed an article somewhere that details your actual mana transfer effiviency.

You probably will see no difference, apart from the slight bit you will lose unless you pull with Vexing at 250hp.

Moreso than raw hps.</P><P>Granted, for the sake of efficieny, adding on more hps after about 1800 or so doesn't help much...but only in terms of efficieny.</P><P>However, after a certain point...and it's going to be different for each individual, depending on how they play...the size of your total mana pool is also irrelevant.  All that matters is how fast you regain mana.  Total mana pool is only meaningful for situations where you have to use a lot of mana in a short period of time...like breaking a camp, or dealing with adds.  For almost all other situations xping or raiding, it's more important to be able to regain mana at a rate somewhat near the rate you are using it...that's what keeps you and/or your group going for the long run.

You can survive running out of mana, running out of hps however...</P><P>If you still don't undstand the advantage of having more hps, then I suggest you go (back to?) play a druid, because you clearly don't understand the balancing act that it is to be an efficient, effective necro.</P><P></P><P>--Nergal Teir'Draconis, Knights of Twilight (Tunare)</font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> HP is a very important aspect of developing a Necro, but it's not always the most important aspect.  It does on the other hand dominate a large portion of a necros developing life.  Before Angrier blows a blood vessel let me explain.</P><P>When a necro or any INT caster is young HP is NOT the most important stat.  INT is it's obviously.  Your first goal when it comes to equipment is to break 200 INT.  The problem is with today's equipment selection this is easy to do for most races.  You can do it non twinked (I'm not sure on Iskars, so forgive me if I'm wrong) by early to mid 30's thanks to the bazaar and the selection of money camps available to you at this level and earlier.</P><P>The next phase usually sees Necro's trying to get as much HP as possible to increase that buffer of virtual mana you can convert without dropping lich or tapping.  This peiod in a necros life lasts a long time, simply because the selection of good HP/STA items that you can afford to buy, quest or loot are not overly easy to come by.  This makes HP seem VERY important, but technically it's not as important as it feels.</P><P>Any extra HP over say your highest life tap/leech plus 40%, to prevent low HP agro, is just a buffer.  It allows you to delay the life tapping to get your HP back and gives you options in situations where things go wrong or you get distracted from staring at your HP guage while liching.  Idealy, no more HP is required than that 40% plus life tap, but no one wants to play like that for long periods of time.</P><P>HP is a very nice stat to have lots of, but more for the buffer than the virtual mana it might offer.  If you don't make mistakes ever or never get distracted/tired then your a necro machine and won't need the extra HP.  For everyone else for the most part once you get beyond 1750 - 2000 HP unbuffed your really at the limits of what extra HP can do for you in a day to day basis.  It just takes a very long time to get there.</P><P>If you are lucky enough to get into an uber guild or have lots of time on your hands you can now seriously look at FT and REGEN.   </P><P>FT is in my opinion much more important than HP after you get to 2000 unbuffed HP.  It lets you avoid having to lich and therfore life tap to regain mana.  The added mana regen from these items allows you to work with less HP since you won't have to lich as much to hit FM.<BR>Also, since your not using lich as much you are actually gaining more mana since your not wasting liched mana on life tapping or HP to full.<BR>FT also has an added bonus of working while you stand.</P><P>So if you can get it, FT is better than HP.  Once you get a nice HP pool to give you some options when you are playing then you should look for FT,IF you can get access to it.  I don't see me getting that FT 10 robe any time soon personally, so I will continue to work on HP and HP Regen.</P><P>That leaves REGEN This is kind of a funny beast for us necros.  There is very little in the way of it available and we really are using it just to make liching more mana efficent.  The biggest reason we want regen is not to replenish our large HP pools between battles it's to slow down the bleeding of HP while we are liching.  Regen items kind of act like poor man's FT items for us.  The more regen you have the less mana your wasting Lifetapping to get HP back from liching.  I  don't have a good idea what the ratio would be but, Regen effect could be coverted to a FT value due to the effect it has on our Liching for mana.  I imaging that the ratio is pretty small. Like 1 point of HP regen is like FT 0.33 or something like that.</P><P>Anyways so the gist of what I'm thinking is that depending on how far you are along in your necros development HP IS or IS NOT the most important stat.</P><P>Trolls feel free to flame me, call me a newbie and idiot or what ever else you might need to satisfy your ego's.  Everyone else give it a read and tell me what you think.</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=115390" target="_blank">Dartoth Ickorkin</a><BR>Warlock of Fraternitas per Honorus<BR></font></td>

In case you haven't learned yet, Regen (hp regen) is effectively increasing your hitpoints.  Why? Well, Lich and HP's are connected, quite intimately.  Start lich when your oom and see. Watch the following example.</P><P>Necro A) Zheart 1500 HP<BR>Necro B) 2000 HP no regen</P><P>Necro A will be losing hitpoints at 48/tick (assuming lvl 60), Necro B will be losing it at 53.  Necro B will be at 0 HP's in 37.7 ticks, Necro A (the regen one) will be at 0 HP's in 31.25 ticks.  The point?<BR>Assuming you are using arch lich, a Regen item gives you EFFECTIVELY 156 HP's (Necro A has the same Full health to death time as a 1656 HP necro).  </P><P>Now the arguement i've yet to see regarding mana and hitpoints is simply the fact of this.  Compare the damage/mana ratio on Vexing (By far our most efficient lifetap) to some other dots.</P><P>Vexing 1098 dam/495 mana = 2.218<BR>Pyrocur 1998dam/400 mana = 4.995<BR>Pyre (if your lucky) 2160/450 = 4.8<BR>Splurt 1600dam/237 mana = 6.75</P><P>Disregarding DPS totally (since we are talking about efficiency rather than rate) It looks to me like Vexing is less than half as efficient as pyre/pyro and 1/3 as efficient as splurt.  Now, WHY do you want more Hitpoints?  For soloing AND raiding?  </P><P>Hitpoints allow you the ability to use the other more efficient spells more often.  Thus increasing your ability to solo more mobs w/o stopping to med.  Regen level does help over time, as losing 48/tick over 5 hours is a huge benefit to losing 53/tick.  However, regen without hitpoints means that you will not get the full use of your vexing.  Having to heal yourself at 50% (assuming you play it safe) and the 1100 heal only gives you 800 hitpoints is a ton of wasted mana.  Getting an 800 heal for 495 mana is a huge waste of efficiency.  Granted the spell does the same damage as previously mentioned, but only healing you 800 hitpoints means you will have to use it again in 15 ticks as you are in the same situation as before, where as it takes 20 ticks to lose the HP's if you use the heal to full.  I'd say 30 seconds is a pretty big difference wouldn't you?</P><P>All that said, i don't think ND3 is the BEST aa for necro's.  I do think it is completely awesome and i love the 300ish hitpoints i get from it.  However, if you are talking about efficiency and mana pool, Spell Casting mastery is by FAR better for us.  Decreasing the cost of a 400-495 dot through specialization is absolutely awesome.  Considering all out major spells (Root, Dark, Lifetaps, Pyro/Pyre, Splurt, undead slows, fears) are all on Alteration, SCM is the most effective use of AA points in my opinion.  Anyway, enough logic for now, wonder if anyone agree's!</P><P> </font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Angrier the point they're trying to make about HP being more mana is as follows.</P><P>Case 1:  1000hps.  Lets say for safety reasons of the average non suicidal necro, the necro in this case is willing to lich down to 30% hp maximum.  That's 700 HP missing off the necro.  He casts vexing and heals those 700 hp for 495 mana.  This takes about 5.7 ticks of vexing.  The spell is nine ticks and 122hps per tick (i used Castersrealm info so not sure if its right) so every tick after that the necro is only gaining 53 hps per tick (because arch lich is taking 53 hps down every tick) instead of 122 per tick for 3.3 ticks.  That's a total 227.7 hps.  So although vexing heals for 1098 / 495 mana you only healed for 870.3 for the same ammount of mana.  I'm sure you can see the difference in those numbers.  Basically, the HP healed / Mana used ratio becomes worse, so you lose more mana due to not having enough Hps.  A necro with about 1.6k hp gets rid of this problem.  The argument that lifetaps are not affected by how much HP you have is therefore wrong when you consider lifetap dots.  </P><P>Case 2: This relates to just a lack of better stat.  Once your mana drops bellow full, as long as you have enough mana to cast all the spells that the fight will require, mana regen comes into play rather than raw mana.  Assume you have a manapool of 3000.  If the maximum mana to have been used at any given time in the fight is , say, 30% (im not usually under 70% so that's a good number), that means that only 900 raw mana will be gone at any given time in the fight.  The rest of your mana pool will depend solely on your mana regen.  So a necro with 3000 mana will be able to solo the same stuff as a necro with 900 mana assuming they both use the same spells.  Now assume at the end of the fight the necro with 3000 manapool is left at about 90% mana due to all the regens.  He's only missing 300 mana.  The necro with 900 mana pool is also left with the same raw mana missing, so he's left with 600 mana and at about 66.7% mana.  Here the necro with 3000 mana can keep fighting but the necro with 900 mana has to rest after every fight recovering 300 mana per fight.  If the necro in case A keeps going he will be at 900 mana after 7 fights.  So after the 8th fight the necro with 3000 mana pool and the necro with 900 mana pool will be at the same place.  Sure the necro in the first senario will have gotten 8 more kills but that's it.  Even if the necro with 3000 mana meds to full, it will take him the time that the necro with 900 mana kills 8 mobs, so it will even it out.  I'm not sure if this is confusing but im fairly certain that a) The math works or b) its 2:30 am and im too tired to think logically.  Also consider that the mana of 3000 to 900 is quite absurd, no one at 60 will have 900 mana, so the difference will be a lot less, maybe even less than 1 fight.  So although HP after 1.6k-2000 becomes less useful in soloing situations, it DOES provide survivability whereas mana (a realistic comparison, not the one I presented here) provides very little advantage.  </P><P>Case 3:  Heals.  The more HP you have the more HPs you can heal in a quicker time (though overall it won't be much difference since you have to drain the HPs you give.)  But since time is a factor in healing others HP helps here.  This works both for your pet when soloing and for groups.  I think this is fairly clear but if you don't see it i can give you an example just let me know.  </P><P>With all that said, is HP more important than every other effect / stat?  Probably not, again, as many people have said, its balance.  But most necros who do preach HP > all are necros who are either raid necros or who wish to become raid necros.  And when you consider raids HP usefulness goes up quite a bit.</P><P>Juryiel Shadowangel<BR>56 Defiler</font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> I hate to say it, but some of you folks really missed the boat on this one, and the fact that Angrier didn't call you on this really just proves he's really trying to make a valid argument and not sink to the depths of a flame-fest like some of you.  I love the argument/flame that "well you just don't take as many risks as we do, so that's why we need HP more than you do".  You folks DO realize that Angrier (like yours untruly) plays on a PVP server, right?  He's in more danger going to his hometown to buy a stack of muffins than you "holier-than-thou" folks are in your uber-leet xp spots.  You have to worry about the occasional bad-pull dealing more dmg than you expected.  We have to worry about 2 wizards and an epic mage pet trying to eat us for breakfast at any given moment.  I'm willing to bet that in an average week of playing, red players take considerably more damage than most blue players do.  Plus, we're in danger ALL the time, not just when we choose to be.  See the fundamental flaw of that particular flame (thinly veiled as an argument) yet?</P><P>Some of you made some valid points, and kudos to you for being adults about it.  When someone presents an opposing viewpoint, one does a serious disservice to his or her self when they act like a child and start hurling insults and names instead of simply arguing their point.  I was pretty shocked to see people I highly respect behave in such a manner in this thread.  Sad indeed.</P><P>Now, on to my opinion on HP's.  There needs to be a "balance" IMO, of HPs and initial mana (int/mana gear).  I personally (as well as Angrier) also need to take resist gear into consideration due to our environment (another point a lot of ppl missed before replying).  I personally didn't start working on HP gear until around lvl 50 or so, and I was able to fight/pull nonstop before I had any.  Like Angrier said, when I got low on HP, I cast BoD, or whatever lifetap DOT I had.  Folks can scream till they'r blue in the face about how inefficient lifetap DOTs are, but my rule of thumb has always been that I should end each fight with a single mob at (or damn close to) FM, and ya know what? I always did, even before upping my HP's to the point that I needed BoD less.</P><P>Actually having some added HP's has certainly helped a great deal, both in survivability (especially from unexpected PVP assaults) and <BR>in increasing the amount of time I could lich without needing a heal.  It certainly is one of our most important stats.  HOWEVER, some people take that to the extreme and severely gimp their initial mana pool in favor of hitpoints.  While I can see situations where that would be beneficial (being the main puller on a large-mob raid, for example), as a "permanent stat", it just doesnt work for me.  I had to BALANCE the two.  The KEY point some people are missing is that it all depends upon your INDIVIDUAL playstyle.  I had at one time went "overboard" with hitpoints (due in no small part to recommendations from people here).  The result?  MY PERSONAL playstyle often involves engaging numerous mobs at once.  It's fun.  What happened when I had shit-tons of HP and considerably less mana was that when I had 5 Dar Ghoul Knights on Jabober and myself, I found myself running dangerously low on mana while I worked to keep everything under control and keep the pet and I alive.  It didn't matter that I could lich back a lot of mana.  That takes TIME.  Time is something you don't have in a situation like that.  Did the added HPs allow me to take more hits?  Sure, but the added mana would have negated the NEED to take as many hits, as I could have polished the enemies off sooner.  The answer?  BALANCE the added HP's (which, as stated, DO help) with a large enough initial mana pool.  It's really quite simple.  But again, that's MY playstyle.  As stated in another thread, one of the "cool" things about our class is that no two necros have the same playstyle.  What works for one might not work for another.  To rant and rave that your way is right, and anyone that disagrees is a moron, is at best childish, and honestly rather uninformed.  There is no "right" answer to a question like this.  To get your proverbial panties in a wad because someone doesn't play the same way YOU do is laughable.</P><P></P><P><BR><img src="http://www.onethirtyeight.com/graphics-2/cg.gif"></font></td>

It's a huge error in your thinking Angrier, that is all.</P><P>Regen is, without a doubt, the most important thing to a necro.  Had I learned of this a year ago, I'd have rolled an Iksar.  Following regen closely is HP.  FT really doesn't even come into the picture at ALL.  I have FT 5 and would trade it all for 50hp without a hesitation.  I got these FT items for the HP on them, not the FT - so you could say i got the best of both worlds.  FT 5 is 50 mana per MINUTE.  I get more than that using AL in 2 ticks.  If I traded my FT 5 for 50hp, that is almost the entire 2 ticks (counting in regen) paid for giving me more mana in 1/5th of the time.

Mana pool isn't really even part of the discussion nor should ANY necromancer focus effort on increasing your mana pool with the exception of some lower levels.</P><P>With that said, the one simple problem with this "anti-HP" position is that HP will ultimately prove FAR more important simply because Regen and FT have hard caps at which point you receive no additional benefit.  Not to mention the effective "soft cap" on regen where once you are able to cancel the effects of Lich (or come close) you are seeing massively diminished returns.  HP has no such cap and I guarantee you are going to want every scrap of HP you can dig up come PoP.</P><P>Those are the realities based purely on numbers, but there's also a massive "X-Factor" associated with having more HP.  A few people have touched on this factor and it primarily has to do with greatly enhanced flexibility in all aspects of the game -- raid, group and solo -- not to mention things like exploration, twinking, etc.  There is no question in my mind that I would be able to do all of these things better than a comparably equipped Angrier but who happened to have 1000 or more fewer hp than I did.  I would be able to solo in spots he would not thus earning faster and better experience with better efficiency, group more effectively and do more things in those groups, provide better heal to mana ratios for clerics, shaman and druids thus increasing their efficiency and of course survive the obligatory AOEs and nukes far better in raid situations.</P><P>That's really just the tip of the iceberg though.  There are FAR more subtleties associated with a large HP pool than I've mentioned here.  It's pretty silly to argue otherwise.</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14661" target="_blank">Savan</a><BR><a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/" target="_blank">Afterlife</a></P><P>Edited by - Savan on 09/30/2002  16:29:21</P><P>Edited by - Savan on 09/30/2002  16:40:43</font></td>

We should rarely die, am i the only one that believes this?<BR>2. i never read anywhere here about our awesome lifetaps and hp leech spells...we basically have been given an indefinite amount of hps. Ever since early necrohood i have always used these spells to help me make mana dont you?? if you are full hps, you are full hps... this doesnt make you have more mana.<BR>3. i believe if you are a serious necromancer, ie both raid ready and solo ready at all times...you should seriously invest in a set of HP/MANA jewelry, and a set of BD jewelry...hp/mana solo, resist raid.<BR>4. if you ever have the chance or opportunity to get your hands on some FT gear, or Zandi heart do it. Honestly i cant think of anything that would compliment a necro more than stackable mana regen and unlimited hp regen. <BR>   all said, HPs are valuble but they arent gonna save your ass on most occasions...the same goes with resists, they are not gonna save you...the only thing that is going to save your ass most times is knowing how to play your character, plain and simple.<BR>   Sturfryd Hijinx<BR>   the nameless</P><P> </font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> i understand your point, and really cant formulate any arguements with it. i was just beating around the bush that the fact is different situations require different fighting techniques. trains, yes i want HPs...no way i can win there. the fact is their just isnt any gear out there that can equal our hp DoT leeches...if you are FM, and you Vex mob to me that is like free hps...close to 1100 of them for a little bit of mana. what about this example...if you are fighting a mob and they can hit for 300 plus...one hit and they have successfully negated alot of hp gear, if not all of it...and if they get you with a double or quad it could be all of the hps your gear gives you. Now in a matter of seconds you are back at square one...the aloted hps vi decided to give necros depending on your initial stats anyway. Or you are fighting casters and dont have your resist gear on...last weekend guild went to CD, we got to king room and i had on hp/mana jewelry and gear not resist...i vex him and with 3 nukes i was toast...and they were incredibily fast nukes too...so fast i had to scroll up to even see what had happened...what i wouldnt have given to have more resists on and maybe have had the chance to get a partial or complete resist some of his spells and maybe i couldve recieved a heal or even got deflux off(love the short cast time) I am sure i will have a chance to try it out again very soon. All styles of fighting are personal ) if you can kill for experiance>>>not light blues<<<< and have no trouble and no deaths i say stick with it...what works for you may not work well with me and visa versa ) I have a druid friend who would rather charm kite in ME than quad kite. just personal preferences. like depending on the situation...maybe off subject a lil but...sometimes i pull mob w/ darkness sometimes i prefer to pull with splurt and then darkness depending on mob speed and how long the pull will be. Sometimes i am full hp gear other times i am all resist. I prefer to have both on hand is all, and have always fought under this in mind...HPS=MANA and MANA=HPS...i have a very easy and accessible way of getting both, so i do it, and at times it is better to be lucky than good.

Pulls don't always bring mobs in the second the first one dies, so it's important to be able to keep lich going and still have a good HP buffer.</P><P>When Soloing, before I had a modest ammount of hit points if I got two or three adds and I was fighting, keeping all the mobs snared/feared, dotting the one my pet was on and generaly blasting mana away like it was going out of style. </P><P>This will usually happen right when the named mob I've been camping for 6 hours spawns.. I'll be at 60% mana anyway, I'll snare/fear/dot whatever and send pet, then my HP buffs will fade, SoW wears off and two adds will just HAPPEN to roam over my camp spot for the first time in 6 hours.</P><P>I can A: Gate and lose the named to whatever druid is hanging around in the zone eagerly waiting to be the bane of my existance. Or I can B: Suck it up, dig my heels in and get evil on this stuff.</P><P>So if you remember right, I'm at 60% mana, I lose 2 bubs of health from the mobs beating on me before I get them mezzed/snared/feared/rooted. My Aego fades and I lose an instan 1k hps. My SoW wears off so I HAVE to keep them all snared. I'm still liching, but only at 3 bubs of health, I get down to 1 bub of mana while tossing the spells I need to at the named and the two adds.</P><P>Once things are under control, I can sit and continue dropping health for mana.. I'm down to 2 bubs (But with a LOT of hit points I'm still well over 1k).. one add breaks fear and comes and whacks me.. I spend another 300 hps and the half bub of mana I regenned getting him back under control. I then toss a Vexing at the named to get him hurt faster and get some of my health back.. but now I'm at 1/2 bub of mana but still liching.</P><P>I sit and continue to lose health for mana. In the end.. I'm able to keep regenerating mana even with only 2 bubs of health because I'm not at a criticaly low health level.</P><P>In the end.. I win based soley on my ability to keep the mana machine going. Longer than I would have been able to if I didn't have it.</P><P>I've had this type of thing happen more than once and I sometimes think Verant had a "Bad luck" modifier in the random number generator.</P><P>That's what it means to me.</P><P><BR><img src="http://www.jackntracie.com/images/gojirax.jpg" border=0></font></td>
