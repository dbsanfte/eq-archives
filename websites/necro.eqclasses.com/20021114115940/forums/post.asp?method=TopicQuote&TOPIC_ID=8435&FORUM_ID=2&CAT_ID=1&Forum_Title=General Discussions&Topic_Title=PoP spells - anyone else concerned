Anyone else concerned about the pop spells that were momentarily posted on lucy?  If we were to recieve spells post 60, i would like to at least feel that they were substantial upgrades to our existing spell lines and have either a high level of everyday functional use or be very powerful situational spells.  Quite frankly i didnt see either.

Here are some issues i saw with them:
- From an overall standpoint of mana efficiency, dps and agro, no dot listed was superior to Funeral pyre in dps or splurt in efficiency.  To boot, the disease and poison dots are rather close to Pox and BoN which are both high resist, high agro spells that are available pre-60 to a shaman.  Why couldnt they just keep progressing our fire line, splurt or introduce a cold based dot?  Instead they're toying around with 2 dots (the poison and dis ones) that i'm assuming most of us would rather not have and may not commonly use.

- For pets, if the mage epic pet is the best summonable pet in game, it suggests a cap for our post 60 pets with regards to dps, hps, etc...  Assuming the mage epic pet delivers 30percent more dps on avg than our spec pet, it suggests a benchmark to which our pets will be balanced against. I'm guessing that our PoP pets will only be marginally better than our spec pet and if this is not the case, then of course what does this mean for mages and their balance issues?


I know i dont speak for everyone here, but pets were never really a major component of my game play.  Yes i summon and use when whenever possible, but the fact remains - we are not a class that is reliant upon pets and if that is the case, why introduce 3 pets in our pop list?

- The darkness upgrade.  Why do we need another dark spell? Its uses on high end mobs is pretty much a mute point (most 60+ mobs are unsnarable or are so MR that landing a darkness cast is 1 in a longshot).  We all know how underused devouring darkness is.  Why give us another spell in this spell line that probably wont be used by the majority of us nec's?  Keep in mind the most popular alternatives have been dooming or epic. Is embracing darkness going to be such an upgrade that we'll either pass on a longer lasting dooming, or a mana free epic click?  /shrug

I know nothing is set in stone yet and its probably too early to begin ranting on these issues but i do want VI to see my opinions about the PoP spells listed on lucy and hopefully they're shared by many others out there.  As a suggestion, i'd like to recommend extensions of our fire dot line and splurt in addition to a lich upgrade and a cold based dot. If our PoP spell list does indeed look like the one posted on lucy - i'll be greatly disappointed and probably looking at other MMORPG alternatives on the market.

On top of that, the only good caster spells go for 50k(some as old as Kunark) while meleers are practically giving away DN drops.</P><P>It's fucked up.  Back when soloing was considered a "caster only" privilege and the Nexus, SOW potions, clicky melee armor and thurg potions didn't exist I could somewhat understand the melee coddling.

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Well, the new people at Verant have stated that they are trying to remove many of the old philosophies of the previous developers. On comment was that they prefer to "under-promise, and over-deliver". Frankly I appreciate that and respect it. They were pretty tight lipped about the bazaar and the new UI. They didn't make a lot of promises about them, and didn't even go into detail of what would be offered. They produced well more than I could have hoped for in both. It allowed me to put a small amount of faith back into the dev team. </P><P>I'd prefer to hear nothing and be pleasently suprised, than not get things that they said they <i>might</i> be able to get in.</P><P>For the spells that we've seen:<BR>The dots do look like crap. There doesn't seem to be a progression at all, just a variety. I don't find variety to be an appropriate reward for effort. </P><P>The pets, however, I have hope for. Where 1 or 2 of these pets may be situational, I can see the SK pet being fantastic. Should have reasonable ac/hp, and a harmtouch every so often would be fantastic. If the HT is on a mob timer reset, it's available every 12-15 minutes isn't it? And if they make our pets more powerful, you can bet that they'll make the mage pets more so. </P><P>Getting the spells has me worried. I don't want to find that they're all drops from the gods. There should be reasonable ability for somewhat casual players to get them without forking out 100kpp.</P><P> </font></td>

Warriors don't use their epics, SKs, paladins, Rogues, all have better weapons avail to them then their epics.  Necro, shammy, druid epics aren't even that good.  Enchanter epic has a haste buff that no one even wants, they all ask for VoG anyway.  So why can't the magician epic not be the best?  Yeah, its a tough quest, but I would have my epic if I were a mage, and I don't have my necro or enchanter epic yet.  </P><P>I don't know how verant is gonna balance things with the new expansion, but eq changes with ever expansion.  EQ today is not the same game as it was back in '99.  Its not worse, just different.  There are things I miss, and things that I like WAY more now. The new expansion will change eq once again, but hopefully it will add new excitings to get and do.  Face it, eq isn't gonna be around forever, but expansions breath life into a game that would be dead now if it didn't continue to expand.  </P><P>The new pets will have to be at least as good as the mage epic, otherwise it won't be much of an upgrade to EoT.  Maybe they will have Epic 2 in the game with a new, tougher pet for mages.  A lot of classes epics are in the bank, why are mages immune to it?  I can buy a better weapon in the bazaar that smokes the paladin epic.  Its just the evolution of EQ.</P><P> </font></td>

Mudflation has really taken a toll on EQ this past year, and yet again it would appear to me that casters got the shit end of the stick having to upgrade both items and spells to be effective in Luclin encounters.

But sub-50 levels can be done several times over in a day, and you get a LOT of spells. Now we're looking at 5 uber hell levels for a small handful of spells, which are all upgrades of our existing spells? Ugh. Haven't we done enough leveling and gotten the same spells with more mana cost and damage enough? I'd like something new, or insanely superior to what we have now. Like a 5k dot for 500 mana. Crazy you say? Not at all. It'd put spells in line with weapons as far as mudflation. Melee weapons have more than doubled in efficiency since the beginning of EQ, why haven't spells done the same?</font></td>
