                <td bgcolor="#37437B" valign="top" width="100%"><font color="white" face="verdana" size="2"><small>Posted&nbsp;-&nbsp;01/16/2004&nbsp;: 01:43:06 AM</small><hr size="1"><span class="spnMessageText"> Basically I tried to post why we don't twitch, using the math, here's the post and here's the last reply:<br /><br />MY POST:<br /><br />kk, this is to clarify why I don't twitch during raid mobs, and that i do actually know what i'm talking about and know how to play my class properly.... I dug out some old maths from the necro boards:<br /><br />verser parsed the idol at 835 dps. the fight lasted 4:31. we healed 226,481 hp. my mana pool is 3300, and i regen mana at 35(al)+7(sp)+7(ft)+13(bard)=62/tick standing. the fight lasted 45 ticks, so i would regen 2790 mana during that time, making my available mana pool for the fight 6090. <br /><br />case 1: twitchin:<br />so let's say i spend all my mana twitching cause i wanna be a team player. both twitch spells are roughly a 3:1 ratio, so assuming i get some decent rolls on spec i can transfer ~3000 mana in that time (due to the total cast time, i.e. recast aswell ,of twitch being 11seconds). let's also pretend that i spread it out perfectly across the ch chain. I believe the chain was set to ch every 2 seconds, so assuming that ch actually costs each cleric about 300 (i'll be generous) mana to cast after spec checks, that's 10 more ch's that can land before they run outa mana. the ma will live an additional 20 seconds because i'm a battery. <br /><br />for the sake of argument, let's say that the idol had just enough hp to make those 20 seconds the difference in the fight, and he dies and we all are oom at the exacty time he eats it. so twitching was a good idea right? let's see. <br /><br />verser has the idol taking 200k in melee damage during that 4:31, and for the sake of argument let's not take the nukers into account, since we can't really judge what their output was, and it would only correspondingly raise the idol's hp in our little example here. i'm pretty sure we can get away with it without breaking our example, which leads us to: <br /><br />case 2: snag does damage:<br /><br />6090 mana for a 4:31 fight. <br /><br />4 funeral pyres in 4 minutes: 2160X4 = 8640 for 1800 mana (it's alteration so we'll call it 1500)<br /><br />3 splurts in 4:30: 4800 for 711 mana (also alt, so we'll say 500)<br /><br />2 pyrocurors in 4 minutes: 4k damage for 800 mana (alt, we'll say 600)<br /><br />4 cessation of cor's in 4 min: 4k damage for 1k mana (alt, 800 mana)<br /><br />vexing mordania 2x over that time: 2k damage for 1k mana, (alt, 800 mana)<br /><br />let's see, that brings dot damage up to: <br /><br />23,440 damage for 4200 mana, leaving almost 3k mana for nukes: <br />4x touch of night (average ~800)= 3200 for about 1400 mana, 1600 not counting specs. <br /><br />so let's call that close enough, and see how much shorter the idol's life would have been without that extra 26,640 hp. <br /><br />the fight lasted 271 seconds, and we did 195,161 damage to him in that time. this puts our dps at 720 (assuming dps is damage/seconds)... again it's actually higher than that, but so is the true value of the hp damage we did to it, so they should cancel each other out. <br /><br />assuming my math is right, it would have taken us an extra 37 seconds to make up for the damage i theoretically did. pretty obviously, my dps is worth twice as much as my twitching. I would rather have a fight last 37 seconds shorter than baseline rather than extend a fight for 20 seconds but have to make up for all my lost damage. this goes doubly for any fight where we have to worry about healing rampage tanks, ae damage, or any other kind of non-ma damage. higher dps = shorter fights = better for everyone. <br /><br />so you see, long fights are no different than any other. twitch is massively, horribly, and unspeakably mana-inefficient. i know it sounds good on paper that being able to heal for a tiny bit longer is best for the encounter, but it obviously isn't. <br /><br />and don't forget my original point, that mind wrack creates mana out of nothing, actually gives each necro doing it more mana than it costs, and is easy done. to give a quickie comparison: <br /><br />twitch: ~3k mana delivered with a 8 second dly recast time spell over 4:31. <br /><br />mind wrack: 9 casts of mw, each netting 300 mana for every person in group: 2700 x 6 = 24,300 mana &lt;--- not a typo. and it's *free*. i can do all my dps i want while doing it, and so can all the other necros. <br /><br />it's a fallacy to think that twitching is anything but a bad idea in most situations outside of buff/coh cycles. it's silly to poo-poo a necro's dps because 'cleric mana' has a mystique of being more important. <br /><br />Unless i've made some gross math error, necro dps is much more useful than our pitiful 3:1 ratio twitches.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now this was taken on a lvl 60 necro..... i'm 65 and can produce much more damage than he has produced there, therefore the damage to twitch ratio is even worse....<br /><br />This parse basically shows how much more effective a necro is at shortening a fight compared to extending it... which as he said helps also with non MT damage (i.e. ramp etc). It's comparable to all the melee in a raid bindwounding the MT lol. (Sinthel likes that example so thought i'd stick it in  )<br /><br />Some of you may also say that I can regen enough mana to sustain my DPS aswell as twitching in between DoT casts.... I would agree except for the fact that 'im permanantly casting one spell or another. If I have all my DoTs running i'll FD and nuke a couple then FD nuke a couple more, then a dot will wear so ill reapply, FD etc etc.<br /><br />Obviously twitch is a tool, a situational tool. I will gladly twitch for buffing and coth etc. I will also twitch someone if they have just died and they are a key class in the raid i.e. chanter goes down doing CC, they get rezzed and i'll twitch em up so they got enough mana to get back to doing CC. Or if the mob is resistant to nearly all my spells lol.<br /><br />Theres other situations that come up where i'll think to myself yea I need to twitch here, but I can decide that cos I know when its best to twitch and best not too... I know my class very well. Also I do not tell other people how to play their class, this is one of the things that nagged me a little. I trust everyone in our guild enough to know that they know what they are doing, please give me the same credit, tis all i ask  <br /><br />Hope this clears things up  <br /><br /><br />P.S. And yes Guno  if I die this all goes out the window lol  <br />But if I die its cos im slacking and not watching my aggro... same as if any other DPS class dies hehe.<br /><br /><br /><br />REPLY:<br /><br />Gannun i am sorry but if this what you base your argument on then it's very wrong.<br />First this guy math is 2 years old and like i told you his math is even more wrong becouse he base it on the fact that all clerics mana pools are the same.<br />Here is how the math should be seen<br />we fight Mobs X, the mob can quad up to 1k 4 times per tick for a MAX dps of 2.6k please notice it's the max DPS we need to heal not the REAL DPS <br />Our uber tank have 9k HP.<br />So to counter the mob we we need to land a CH every 2 sec (the math is that a MA should NOT get below 40% life anyware during the fight otherwise every time a cleric lag a little we have a dead MA) so we need to run a chain assumeing MA have 5.4k and that goes to about 1 CH each 2 sec, now at this point i will assume the chain is PERFECT there is no delay between the clerics so wwe only need to use 6 clerics (normaly for such mobs we will use at lease 7 clerics with a backup CCH of druid like MM).<br />Let's assume cleric 1-4 have 5000 mana pool FT15 MC3 have all the buffs total mana regen is (16+15+3+9+ 51<br />We also have two clerics with 4500 mana pool Ft12 MC1 total mana regen is (16+12+1+9+ 46<br />ok now during this fight the clerics cast CH every 12 sec (the fastest we can) i will not enter paragon/rod etc to the calcolation couse they will make it even more complicated and they work on the necro side too.<br />lets assume that CH cost on evrage 350 mana.<br /><br />Ok now look at the raid<br />We have <br />3 war 100 DPS each - 300<br />6 paladin/sk 100 DPS each - 600<br />6 mages 150 DPS - 900<br />4 rogues 200 DPS - 1200 <br />4 shaman 75 DPS - 300<br />6 druids 125 DPS - 750<br />4 monks 150 dps - 600<br />6 clerics <br />4 necro<br />total raid DPS 4650 without necro<br />Now to take a mob with 1.250k HP <br />Lets try two paths<br />Path one necro goes DPS<br />4 necro 250 DPS 1k damage the fight last 221 sec or 3 min 41 sec <br />Clerics will need 18 CH 6300 mana<br />cleric type A have 5000 + 1836 for a total of 6836 mana<br />Cleric type B have 4500 + 1656 for a total 6156 mana.<br />Result of the fight WIPE!!!!!!! since cleric type B run out of mana before mobs hit ground.<br />Path two necro dont DPS AT ALL we will need 268 secs or 4 mins and 28 sec<br />During this fight each cleric will need to cast 22 CH or 7700 mana.<br />cleric type A have 5000 + 2278 for a total of 7278 mana<br />Cleric type B have 4500 + 2054 for a total 6554 mana.<br />During this fight cleric type B will need 1146 more mana twitch is 400 mana and give 150 so he will need 8 twitch (we will do 9 to be sure), at 11 sec per one it will take 1 necro 100 sec and 3600 mana to twitch cleric type B we need to work on two clerics like that resulting in 200 sec and 7200 mana so one necro is OOM from twitching during this fight (or we can say two necro spent 100 sec and less them 1/2 there mana during this 268 sec).<br />clerics type A need 422 mana each we will do 5 twitch to be safe, we have 4 clerics of type A so we will need 20 twitch for a total time of 220 sec and 8000 mana (again 2 necro need to spend 110 sec each and about 1/2 mana pool on this) we WIN /tell officer for loot.<br /><br /><br />Look at the math gannun sure if the necro is about 40% of raid dps like in his story then it's wise to put them in the position of DPS but that's not the case please notice i took low number DPS for all classes and high number for Necro and still without twitch we are DEAD with it we win AND the necro still have time to use there better rate dots and i didnt even counted that damage.<br /><br />If you still think i am wrong show me some real math not this mambo jumbo this guy put up he didn't count Nukes so he raise his own importance in the raid, he only count the HP that they healed not the HP that they should run the CCH in order to keep the MA up, all in all this guy may know a lot about been a necro but he know SHIT about how raids are realy done.<br /><br />So for now during boss fight we will twitch clerics.<br /><br />P.S. unless someone can show me REAL math that take some real raids info and prove that yes necro going total DPS is better<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Anyone able to work the math through the Real Game situatons for me? i'm crap with that stuff.....<br /><br />**********<br />-we don't like twitching and we're tired of talking about it every other week, With love, -Dobi<br />**********</span></font></td>

I could prolly could do it faster if i had better spell haste item too, only using spell haste IV.  I agree with the later part of your statement aneastin, necro does not replace cleric, but then you gotta make use with what you have available each raid.  That being said, your numbers are completely innacurate for computing the dmg efficiency though.  You are assuming that a necro who spends the entire raid twtiching is only extended the average life of the raid by 2 seconds.  I see you are using my numbers somewhat, so let me explain, the necro is extending the average life of the raid by 2 second PER 592 mana sent.  Your numbers are very close, they would lopsided in favor of twitching if you corrected the math mistake.<br /><br />Bruuce,<br /><br />By all means play the game for fun first.  Don't feel you need a logical reason to do anything in game as long as it makes you happy.  I enjoy dpsing as much as anyone (in fact too much), and I know how to do dps as good as anyone.  But the devils argument needs to be made, and I would love for someone to prove flat out twitching is retarded even when your raid is lacking in the healing department.  I have not seen that argument made yet.  If my raid whipes cause healers went oom I do not have fun if I dps'd and think back later that I could have saved the raid if I did differently.  That being said, twitching will always leave you feelign gimp even if you think its optimal, just by its nature of taking you out of any real decision making role after you choose to twitch.  <br /><br />As far as this topic being moved to rant section,<br /><br />Well i didn't author any of the two twitch posts i saw, but damn if nummy aint playing favorites, I mean look at all the rants up there.  I mean debuff slots, how many times has that been raised, but I know thats nummies hot issue being in the l33t necro guild, run by necros with more necros than they know what to do with....  <br /><br /></span></font></td>

I could care less what you do on raids.  I play this game to have fun.  I dont have fun twitching clerics.  Clerics in my guild dont need to be twitched.  Ive prolly used mana pump a grand total of 2 times the last 4-5 months and that was when me and about 15 others went and killed emp.  We didnt have a bard and we had 3 clerics.  That was the only time in the last 2-3 years where I have actually thought that mana pump was necsessary.  If your raids require you to mana pump, recruit more clerics.<br /><br />also I will continue to speak my mind on this board.  If I see 3 twitch threads on the front page and Im not doing anything in eq(this morning my server crashed) Im gonna call you out on it.  Twitch threads pop up at least once a week, i did a search on 'twitch' just now and got 6 pages.  wtf is the point?  Its fucking stupid.  stfu about twitch.  either do it or dont.  no one really gives a shit.  sentence fragments.<br /><br />And as for posting math or logical arguements, i believe i just posted a logical arguement.  fuck math, i dont care that much.<br /><br />sincerely,<br /><br />bruuce</span></font></td>

For every 592 mana you can effectively extend a raids life by 2 seconds, a raid at the very minimum (even the gimp raid in the original post) will have a dps of about 4500.  Show me any other way a necro can spend 592 mana and effectively do 9000 points of damage.  Not only is it impossible but those posts where a necro gets 250-300 dps include pet damage, we don't include pets, becuase in a fight are in no way related to a necros mana bar.  Finally stop being so fucking condescending to Ganun for posting a twitch thread, I follow these boards, and all I here is condescending crap on twtich without any numbers or facts, if you wanna disagree, post some math or logical arguments.  I know you can, I know your capable, I've seen you do it before...so why not try, huh?<br /><br /></span></font></td>

Now lets say that you twitched the weak link in this chain. For every 592 mana you spend, they receive 320 mana which is enough for them to cast another CH.  So every 592 mana you send someone the CH chain continues to function, and the death and carnage of the MT dying is delayed 2 seconds longer....<br /><br />Now, what is a reasonable dps for an entire raid nowadays?  Don't time gods have at least 1million hp? Nummies guild killed them in 3.8 minutes by her parse, making a raid dps of about 4500 (If anyone knows actually how much hp a PoT god has, particularly tallon zek, plz post, and i'll edit this part).  So, by sacrifcing 592 mana, you effectively allow the raid to function 2 seconds longer, creating 9000 additional damage.  <b> 9000/592 = 15 Damage to mana ratio, a better damage to mana ratio than <u> any necro dot.</u> </b><br /><br />For those necros arguing that twitching is inefficient you need to come up with a better argument.  Now granted, if your a necro and dpsing, a shorter fight, less can go wrong, this is a valid point.  It is also a valid point that necros are not the only source of mana.  But if your healers are going OOM to soon to win the fight, using the twtich spell can easily swing the difference.  That being said, its a gimp tactic, as lame as mages pooping mod rods, and I wish the twitch spells didn't exist.  Because twitch = somebody else playing with your mana, and you medding, is not fun.<br /><br /></span></font></td>
