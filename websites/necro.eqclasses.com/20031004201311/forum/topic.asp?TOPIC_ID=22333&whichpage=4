You've probably never met someone that isn't on city water, or that can look out their window and not see asphalt or another building.

I don't even know where the nearest fire hydrant  IS, but I can assure you it's several miles away.<br /><br />That kind of "everywhere must be like here, and if it aint it should be" attitude is exactly what's wrong with this country.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br /> Sorry your fire fighters are just going to have to use their personal vehicles to ferry water back and forth from their homes.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />No different than my tax-paying neighbors.

Hey, no FDA to make sure the eye drops are safe.  They only make about 20% of people go blind, but hey, the hostpital has your money, so screw you.  Oh yeah, if you don't pay the hospital, they <i>will</i> send jackbooted thugs to come get their money from your blind ass.

All of my food and/or drugs have <b>already</b> been tested, and that's why I know they're safe to eat and/or take.  The FDA only regulates controlled substances.  You could box up a pile of dog shit, and put it in your pantry, eat it when you wish.  No jackbooted thugs are going to come stop you.

He certainly has the right to <i>say</i> whatever he wants.  I also have the right to tell him, and everyone else, how stupid he is.<br /><br />The only thing he's talked about that might even be some small sliver of a good idea is privatizing some of the agencies that the government has now (ala Underwriters Laboratory).  What he, in his stupidity, fails to realize is that these privatized organizations are still going to cost money, and they're still going to tell you what to do, <b>whether you ask them to or not!</b><br /><br />Oh yeah, anyone with two brain cells to rub together could do a google search and figure out that following Mr. Schiff's advice to not pay taxes is indeed a bad idea.  In less than 5 minutes I found horror stories of people losing <i>millions</i> of dollars because they listened to that idiot.  If you don't like paying taxes, that's fine, you can complain about it all you want.

I don't agree the lib-dems at all so I initially rejected his thought, but after taking the time to consider the fundimentals he seems to believe, I changed my mind. I think its much more ligitimate to question governments role as a whole reguardless of which side of the line you stand on. <br /><br />I don't agree with alot of the things implied  tho, I'm happy to live in a tried and true form of government that focuses on individual liberty, has a track record of making good value judgements on humanity as a whole and is at least sensitive to the individuals right to dissent and speak as individuals. For every arguement made about how bad the US government is/has been in the past, 10 arguements can be made for the US and its great history on such issues. Contrast that with just about any other county in history and there is some perspective to be gained.<img src="images/bigeyes_125.gif" border="0" alt="" title="" align="middle" /><br /><br /></span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

Sure.  Unfortunately, you're wrong.<br /><br />During the Whiskey Rebellion a bunch of Appalachian Hillbillies (just like Drex) proclaimed their right to refuse to pay taxes that THEY considered unjust and unconstitutional.  George Washington himself called out the army and marched it out to crush the rebellion, shot a bunch of people, then put the surviving ringleaders on trial. And the people who lead the Revolution cheered him on.<br /><br />That's because everyone understood that in a democracy elected officals and the courts are responsible for framing, interpreting, and enforcing the law.  Easily excitable, semi-literates don't get to appoint themselves to the job, and then unilaterally declare the laws don't apply to them.  Thats not 'rugged individualism'.  Its 'criminal behavior' at best and 'attempting to overthrow a democratically elected government' at its worst.<br /><br />Our elected officials and the courts, in their wisdom, have decided we have to pay income taxes.  The constitution was amended to specifically allow it, even though an income tax had been used on and off for decades prior to the amendment.  _LEGAL_ efforts to claim the amendment is invalid, and hence the taxes are invalid, have all failed.  Individuals don't get to 'opt out' because they think they've discovered a legal loophole, any more than they can 'opt out' of the their local criminal code or the Clean Air Act.<br /><br />Sometimes people DO manage to convince judges and juries that they are so stupid and confused they don't actually belong in jail for refusing to pay.  But they still HAVE TO PAY TAXES.  And they have to pay the financial penalties, too, if they pay late.<br /><br />The IRS may not notice you immediately, but they will notice eventually....then your financial life will be mud for the rest of your life....assuming you stay out of jail.<br /><br />/shrug<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Fine.  Set your withholding allowances high, stop filing your returns, then wait ten years and see what happens.  Don't say you weren't warned, though.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

We had a DOCTOR tell us that years ago in elementary school.  Same thing with peroxide, I frequently get wax buildups in my ear and it was a DOCTOR that told me peroxide is good to "bubble it out."  If you'd read my post you would recall that originally I thought the problem was jsut a bad wax buildup.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br /><br />Thats the best you can come up with? The FDA? You know how many products they approve that are harmful, and how many they "disapprove" that are no more harmful than others?  Besides, as I've said in another post, private industry would do just as good, and probably a BETTER job.<br /><br />Think Underwriter's Laboratories, or even Consumer Reports for an excellent example of widely-recognized standardized product safety testing.<br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Well hell, why even bother getting products tested for safety?  Getting a product UL certified isn't free, so why not just skip the whole process?<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Now who's being silly? But you do bring up a good point: UL testing ISNT free; who pays for it?  Manufacturers pay UL to test their products so that they can stick that little "UL approved" logo on their products if they pass.  They do this because they know that many consumers look for that label, and will buy a product that carries it over one that does not; they'll also generally pay extra for a product that's UL approved.  <i>It's a smart business decision for the manufacturers to pay UL to test their products.</i> Given the number of years UL has been around, I'd say plenty of manufacturers realize this.<br /><br />Additionally, due to a fear of lawsuits for selling faulty products, many retailers refuse to carry products that haven't undergone some kind of testing.  Go into Office Depot or Staples n see how many desk lamps they carry that aren't UL approved.<br /><br /><b>Proof-positive that the free-market can provide for product safety testing.</b><br /><br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br />If you think your product is pretty safe, just let it into the market.

Do you do business with just anyone, or do you again ask your friends, neighbors and coworkers for suggestions, perhaps even check the Better Business Bureau if there's been any complaints against your prospective business associate?<br /><br />You dont think that if some Doctor's patients started keeling over dead after being treated for ear infections that sooner or later folks would stop seeing that Doctor and find one that had a good reputation?<br /><br />You don't think that, in an effort to keep their own costs down, that insurance companies would refuse to "allow" (ie pay for) you to see a Doctor thats "lost" several patients who came in for an ear infection?  Again, the free market would quickly weed out the quacks.<br /><br />My Gawd, how EVER did mankind avoid extinction before the benevolent US Federal government was aroudn to take care of us all?<br /><br />Maybe YOU don't have enough common sense to only seek out reputable doctors and businesspeople, but I think most folks do, and those that don't will likely be "nannied" by their insurance companies far better than they're currently "taken care of" by the Nanny-State.  It'd probably be a helluva lot cheaper, too, being that competition would be allowed to drive the market.

As I said, I do not agree with many of his beliefs but I think his voice definitely needs to be heard.  Our country was built on dialog and compromise but, in my opinion, that has started to change in the last few years.  Since the politically correct crowd has gained acceptance it seems that any dissenting opinions are quickly shouted down and we lose the opportunity to have rational discussions where everyone is free to come to their own conclusions.  Keep raging against the system Drex your voice needs to be heard too.<br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Drex is a moron, and a self admitted criminal.  He certainly has the right to <i>say</i> whatever he wants.  I also have the right to tell him, and everyone else, how stupid he is.<br /><br />The only thing he's talked about that might even be some small sliver of a good idea is privatizing some of the agencies that the government has now (ala Underwriters Laboratory).

If you don't like paying taxes, that's fine, you can complain about it all you want.

'Rugged individualism' is not something usually associated with guys who walk away from their business, and abandon their employees, so they can get drunk every night.  Its not a phrase usually used to describe guys who spend most of their time playing EQ, and posting long-winded rants on internet message boards.  Its not an ideal one associates with grown men who refuse to pay income taxes, but go to government & charity backed health care clinics when they are sick, and then get bent out of shape when asked for a picture ID.<br /><br />A few other phrases come to mind.  'Hillbilly' is one of the most mild.<br /><br />Hell yes, Drexyll has a right to his opinions.  So do you.  But saying he tries to live his life by "the idea of rugged individualism that many of our forefathers lived and preached" is kind of gooshie, don't you think?<br /><br />And to be honest, we should all be skeptical about the whole 'rugged individualism" thing anyway.  The first thing most pioneers did once they had cleared a homestead was help build community organizations and buildings: militias, churches, schools and town councils.  The whole idea of the 'rugged individual' seems to have sprang up after the frontier was closed.  It was a product of dime novels about the frontier, not the frontier itself.<br /><br />Hell....most of the pioneers settled plots that had been surveyed off first by the federal government.  And they were given the land, FOR NOTHING, by Uncle Sam.  The settlement of the USA's western frontier was one of the biggest government-run welfare schemes in history.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

We had a DOCTOR tell us that years ago in elementary school.  Same thing with peroxide, I frequently get wax buildups in my ear and it was a DOCTOR that told me peroxide is good to "bubble it out."  If you'd read my post you would recall that originally I thought the problem was jsut a bad wax buildup.<br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />When your ear hurts, you're supposed to go to the doctor, period.

But you do bring up a good point: UL testing ISNT free; who pays for it?  Manufacturers pay UL to test their products so that they can stick that little "UL approved" logo on their products if they pass.  They do this because they know that many consumers look for that label, and will buy a product that carries it over one that does not; they'll also generally pay extra for a product that's UL approved.  <i>It's a smart business decision for the manufacturers to pay UL to test their products.</i> Given the number of years UL has been around, I'd say plenty of manufacturers realize this.<br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />It is once again you who is being silly.  Do you think for one moment that the cost that manufacturer incur getting products tested and approved isn't passed on to you? If you don't, then perhaps it is a bit more clear why you ran your perfectly good business into the ground.<br /><br />Not only that, but I can guarantee you that at least 25% of the population of the US (probably upwards of 50%, maybe even more) don't have a fricking clue what the Underwriters Laboratory is, or what it does.  They don't give a rats ass if the little UL symbol is on their curling iron.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br /><br />Additionally, due to a fear of lawsuits for selling faulty products, many retailers refuse to carry products that haven't undergone some kind of testing.

People would think maybe they just didn't eat enough shit or something, and they CERTAINLY wouldn't tell everyone else, "hey, don't buy that dogshit that guy's sellin as an arthritis cure, it doesnt work!"<br /><br />By golly, maybe you're right.  Thank goodnes we have the federal government to, for a nominal fee, protect us from our own ignorance, right?  Maybe YOU need to pay someone to tell you that eating shit doesn't cure arthritis, but I don't, and I don't think I should have to pay for anyone's ignorance.  Besides, I'd trust a for-profit insurnace company before I'd trust a "public good" beauracracy.  Should my insurance company inform me that they'll not cover any damages I suffer after eating said dogshit, which they have NOT approved, and should I chosoe to eat the dogshit anyway, I don't expect you to do more than my insurance company and pay for my own stupidity.  You should appreciate that rather than criticize it.<br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Well, if you'll fall for Shiff's line of crap, even though there is ample evidence to say that following his "method" isn't a good idea, then I wouldn't be suprised one little bit if someone could manage to convince you that eating dog shit was good for you.  <br /><br />It didn't take me more than 30 seconds to find that Schiff's stupid ideas have managed to make people lose millions of dollars, and in some cases get sent to prison.  Yet here you are trying to get people to adhere to his ideas and follow his examples?  People will buy <b>anything</b> if it is presented to them right.  You are proof positive of this.<br /><br />Do you really think that the insurance companies are going to look out for you for free?  Think again buster.  If the insurance companies had to regulate safety that is currently regulated by the government, you'd pay for it.  I guess I should rephrase that and say that the people who have insurance would pay for it, and the rest of the people in the free market wouldn't have anything to do with you because you don't have insurance.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br /><br />Who said we don't have a filtration system?<br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />I don't care if you do or don't.  The fact of the matter is there is an agency that you can contact that will give the information of how to safely treat your water.  You would pay for this service whether it is private or governmental.  The only difference is since the information is provided by the government and it's already been paid for, it doesn't seem like a big deal to you.<br /><br />If you privatize, then the information becomes valuable.  Not only would you not have any idea on how to treat your water, you'd get charged through the fricking nose in order for someone to set it up for you.  Wanna know why you'd get charged so much?  It's because only the people with wells would have to pay, making the cost much higher to those individuals.  You're going to pay no matter what you do.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br />Oh, you <b>do</b> appriciate our standing military then?  <b>Start paying for it you leech!</b><br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />I didnt say that, either.

As soon as it moves to private hands, who is going to put a check on what the military does?  Remember, private individuals don't get elected.<br /><br />Regardless... you would <b>still have to pay for it!</b><br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br /><br />But thanks to our volunteer fire department, such a need won't arise.  Where's our tax break?  Besides, I think that's a silly argument.  There's an auto mechanic down the road to fix my worthless car, should the need arise.  Should I be paying him a percentage out of all my financial transactions, just because he's there?<br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />If your local government doesn't have to spend as much money on fire trucks, then the local budget won't be as high, thus they won't need to tax you as heavily on every tranaction you make.  You <b>do</b> get a break if they don't need to spend the money.<br /><br />I'm also willing to bet that your volunteer fire department isn't all you've cracked it up to be.  More likely, it is a bunch of people who volunteer to help the "real" fire department if they run into something they need extra man power for.  For <i>real</i> emergencies, I'm sure there is a paid, professional fire department on call 24/7.<br /><br />Your mechanic analogy is quite flawed as well.  First of all, if you take your car to the mechanic, you have to <b>pay</b> him to fix it.  The fire department will not send you a bill when your lean-to burns down and they have to put it out.  If the fire department <i>did</i> send out bills (because they were privatized) you can bet your sweet ass the bills would be a hell of a lot more than you pay in taxes.  Then guess what happens?  You have to pay more on your fire insurance to cover the fire department bill, and the fire department would no longer go to homes that couldn't prove they could pay.<br /><br />Secondly, if your car is broken down at 3AM, you wait til the next morning to get it fixed.  That doesn't work for fire departments, they need to be there 24/7.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if you privatized all of the governmental agencies?  I would just love to dial 911 and the first thing I hear is "credit card number please".<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br /><br />Why are you stuck on this "living off the land" thing?

I don't see you trying to argue for or demonstrate that the bloated State-monopoly on services really makes people better off, I see you hurling insults about hillbillies and vermin-infested shacks.  I don't think that's doing much to prove me wrong.<br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />You aren't offering squat, your ideas won't work because they aren't thought out far enough.  There are reasons things are done they way they are, whether you realize them or not.  To even pretend that you have some small semblance of an idea on how to run a nation of almost 300 million people all by yourself is absurd.  There are so many factors that are involved that you don't even have a clue about it is pitiful.  <br /><br />You haven't proven anything, you haven't shown that privatizing every aspect of the government will help anything.  All you've done is complain that you're getting services you don't want, even though you go back and want to utilize those services once you need them.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if the government didn't <i>require</i> hospitals (more specifically emergency rooms) to take in people regardless of whether they can pay or not, you'd probably be dead.  The free market would have dictated that the chances are you couldn't pay, so you would have been turned away.  Since no reputable doctor would have seen you (because you didn't have insurance), you would have been left with whatever you could find.  You might have been able to find some anibiotics, but who knows?  With no FDA to regulate drugs, you might have been sold sugar pills by a charlatan.  <br /><br />The idea of privatization of <i>some</i> government agencies in of itself isn't really all that bad, but the way you present it is stupid.  Your views are so extreme that they no longer make any sense.  To argue that the privatization of some government agencies might lower the burden on the tax payer is a noble idea if one can find a way to do so without endagering the citizens.  To say the government is robbing the citizens blind for no reason is simply stupidity.  To claim that you don't get anything you want for your tax dollars is dumb.  Yes, you probably pay for some things that you'll never use, but lots of other people have paid for things that you <i>do</i> use.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

Fact is, it isn't privatized, nor would I hand over my personal privacy and protection to some company which wouldnt be responsible to answer to anyone, nor would I think most people.  But most importantly, it is NOT privatized now.  So as I stated, don't ever waste their time again.  If you are in trouble, die.

Even with governments in place, people still got away with murder and even the governments did.  The "rights" you claim to have are given and protected by the people around you and by the government that protects their rights and punishes them should they break them.  I don't think you're so stupid as to think that if the whole government collapsed and people were left to their own devices, that we'd all just decide to be kind and civil to each other...just because.  <br /><br />Let's face it, man.  You're a loser who makes a miniscule income and dug up some radical ideas to try to find loopholes around income taxes because you don't want to give up what little money you have.  YOu've made sure you have nothing of value to take from you.  Don't give me any moralistic babble, I'm not that stupid.  You just want more of your own money, fuck everybody else.  Period.  Like I said, go for it.  But don't you dare use any of the public services that are paid for by taxes to which you do not contribute.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>
