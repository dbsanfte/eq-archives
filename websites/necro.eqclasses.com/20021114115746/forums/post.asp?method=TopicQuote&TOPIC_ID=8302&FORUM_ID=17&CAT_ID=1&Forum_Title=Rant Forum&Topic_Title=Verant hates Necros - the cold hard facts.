Verant or the people at VI / SOE clearly hate the necro class. I have sat back (well in truth I have raised a ruckus over every point to no avail) and watched this happen. Now I feel it is time for an accounting.

If you have any other clear necro class nerfs then please post them here. Perhaps we might get some action when VI realizes that our class has been utterly worked over and left for dead.

1. Necro spell resists. Our spells are much more resistable than any other classes at any level.

2. Necro group buffs. We were given a set of group buffs. Sadly they clash so badly with so many things they are often worthless. Does anyone have any kind of explanation why Zefeers Theft of Vitae would not stick if a player has Grim Aura? Why do our reverse hitpoint heals not stick if the recipient is dotted? Why does our Degeneration spell dramtically lower agility? etc. etc. etc.

3. Necro mana regen. Strange that we are the only class that cannot benefit from enchanter based mana regen buffs.

4. Necro versus Enchanter Dire Charm. We can only DC undead, Ench can DC anything. Ench can DC mobs two levels higher than we can - considering that they have no restriction at all on the class of mob they DC (undead, summoned, plant, animal, npc) surely they should be restricted to mobs two levels lower than Necros and Druids?

5. Necro Lifeburn versus Wizard Manaburn. Why does necro lifeburn not stack yet Manaburn does?

6. Cosmetically. Why was our gradually upgradded badass looking pet series taken away from us and replaced with a single model that looks like it is walking with a cold iron rod shoved up it's rear end?

7. In what way does our epic look like a Scythe? Oh no it looks like a quacking duck - very very dangerous looking - my ass. There are inumerable weapons that look vastly more intimidating than our "quack stick".

8. Why is the necro epic so insanely hard to get? Forget the fact that it "can be bought" - the components are insanely rare drops.

9. Why is our level 59 pet, with no exceptions on any server, the rarest level 59 spell in the game. Substantially more rare than most level 60 spells?

10. Why is the necro focus book so incredibly rare? Over 30 trips to Hate, seen the broodmaster only 4 times and he has not dropped the book once.

11. Why are we prevented from casting our spells multiple times? Yes I do mean stacking our own dots. Last I checked our mana pool was no bigger than anyone of equal level / int / manaitems. Last I checked a Wizard can chain nuke with their biggest nukes doing nearly as much damage as our biggest dots and they don't have a "stacking" issue.

12. Why are there ZERO focus items cast by wizards that will improve DOT's? There are focus items for every other kind of spell.

13. Why do we get our last non-lifetap DD at level 55, which happens to be equivalent damage wise to our level 44 DD?

14. Why is that level 55 DD (Conglaciation of Bone) only dropped off one **LEVEL 70** mob in the entire game? Anyone know any other 55damage DD that is dropped off a level 70 mob?

15. Why is Dead Men Floating, only dropped ***RARELY*** off a single mob in the entire game? It is a group beneficial buff, it does nothing for us individually.......??????

16. Why is our resistance debuff spell line so resistable that it is not even worth scribing into our spellboook let alone trying to cast?

Why do Verant never ever, I mean not once in the entire time I have played this game, checked to see what effect their latest patch is going to have on the necromancer class? Without fail it screws us over in some way.

This latest patch, supposedly aimed at fixing the ongoing problems dot stacking problems has been the absolute worst ever for our class. Sure they are possibly going to fix some of the horrendous problems they have created. But the point has to be that they NEVER BOTHERED TO TEST ANY OF THESE CHANGES ON THE CLASS THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO AID.

I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that ***SOMEONE*** at VI has a serious mental block with the necro class and is trying hard to damage it gradually until no-one wants to play the class any more. All I can say to this dim-witted person or persons is:-

This is a roleplaying game - get over your petty inability to accept that and get rid of your obvious bias against the Necromancer class.

Last I checked a Wizard can chain nuke with their biggest nukes doing nearly as much damage as our biggest dots and they don't have a "stacking" issue."</P><P>All wizards have is damage, we have much much more.  If we could stack dots we'd be forced to use all of our mana for dots, I'd rather be more useful, shrug...solo dot stacking isn't something you'll see verant implementing anytime soon.</P><P>"12. Why are there ZERO focus items cast by wizards that will improve DOT's? There are focus items for every other kind of spell."</P><P>Magicians I believe you mean, I'm not sure about this one either though.  We do however get very nice ones.  I just got one that increases my dots by 20%.</P><P>"13. Why do we get our last non-lifetap DD at level 55, which happens to be equivalent damage wise to our level 44 DD?"</P><P>Ancient: Lifebane.  Check it out.</P><P>"14. Why is that level 55 DD (Conglaciation of Bone) only dropped off one **LEVEL 70** mob in the entire game? Anyone know any other 55damage DD that is dropped off a level 70 mob?"</P><P>Why complain? The spell sucks anyway, heh.  Would you complain if I had a bottle of spoiled milk 50 feet above your head and you had nothing to get it with?  Probably not.</P><P>"15. Why is Dead Men Floating, only dropped ***RARELY*** off a single mob in the entire game? It is a group beneficial buff, it does nothing for us individually.......??????"</P><P>This is like a warrior complaining that primal doesn't drop off orc pawns, his DPS would increase and that benefits the group he's in!  Guess what, some things are just the way they are, you have to deal because they won't be changed.  This spell was implemented on the chardok revamp I believe, they wanted chardok to be more beneficial to group in.  Didn't really work though.</P><P>"16. Why is our resistance debuff spell line so resistable that it is not even worth scribing into our spellboook let alone trying to cast?"</P><P>Again, I've had no problem sticking this on mobs that aren't immune to the spell.  The point of this spell is to lower the resists, obviously the spell will resist if the resists aren't low.</P><P>Your gripes are so lowly that it would be a waste of time for verant to fix 90% of them, there are things that NEED to be fixed, none of those things are here.  Sorry bud, but I don't agree with most of your post.</P><P>Necromancer is a great class in its current state, open your eyes to your surroundings.  Of course there are better classes than us, who cares.</P><P>Edited by - Moonspark on 09/21/2002  03:42:28</font></td>

It was changed to a poison DD, and is in fact the ONLY ancient DD spell that is resistable now, all other classes where changed to unresistable.</P><P>Also, your focus item you have is a random effect between 1-20% of every affliction type spell you cast.</P><P>Our Class AA is a joke, MGB :)? for what spell? dead men floating? no one on my server even has it yet. Fearstorm? the spell that cant fear anything ablove lvl 53 cause they all resist it? Undead mez? I'm still trying to find a place that will be useful. Pet lay on hands? LOL please. Change meat to bones? I don't think Im ever out of bones chips. Call to corpse - this is a good one. Inate ITU? who cares I can cast ITU. Dire Charm I like that one, and Lifeburn, only getting it because I need to be a lich to get PoP AA skills. </P><P>There are many other things VI could fix with necro. Specifically, in PoP spells listed, we have NO updated DD's or Taps. So while nearly every other class gets 1100 DD's we will still be tapping for 710 at lvl 65. Ranger can DD now for like 685 hehehehe. Clerics get a 1200 undead DD in PoP, but not us :) Shaman have a 3400 dot, but our dots are less damage than what our best dots do now.</P><P>The dots they gave us are nearly the same damage as pyro, the darkness upgrade and EB upgrade, and Lich upgrade r nice, but we got so hosed in comparision to other class upgrades. Our DPS and Mana efficiency upgrades are 8-10% range, while others are in 30-50%.</P><P>Why is it we have yet to get a mana transfer spell upgrade? They let magi make items that are nearly a 1-1 mana transfer, but we still have to loose 400 mana to transfer 150. </P><P>Our input on raids was just lowered even more :( Groups don't need us for mana transfer because of magi rods, we will not be able to do decent damage compared to all other classes now, and most of our group spells don't stack with other class buffs. SK now can conjure corpse. So what exactly is our role on raids? Its not DPS, debuff, buff, or healing cause our heals dont stack anymore, so we now take a seat behind pally's in class need on raids. All I can say is I hope our new pets r monsters to help out.</P><P></P><P> </font></td>

Last time I checked my spell book was rather big but the spells I use often are limited to about 12.</P><P>"we get a lot of spells that do not normally get resisted or cannot get resisted" - in what world is this? The only spell we get that cannot be resisted is the Ancient Lifetap (woot a 560 damage dd of which none have dropped on Luclin yet to my knowledge) and lifeburn - which is not a spell but a nerfed ability. /sarcasm on Last time I checked 1 non-dropped spell out of more than 100 does not qualify as "a lot".</P><P>"get rid of our group buffs and give us something useful" - like what? the ability to vanish into oblivion and be forgotten?

Sorry I raised the issue, you are right Moonspark - we should not get the benefits of bard mana regen or that nice beastloard mana regen spell either - Please nerf us some more Verant and take these abilities away becuase I really really don't like being beholden to you.

We get Funeral Pyre which is rarely resisted, pyrocruor is resisted some of the time, but it's a low level spell. Splurt almost always lands, touch of night always lands, vexing always lands (save if the mob is immune to magic), the disease tap lands, these are plenty of spells to keep you busy during a whole raid.  Mind wrack, theft of vitae also rarely get resisted.  Lifeburn is hardly a nerf, I can do 7k+ dmg with it (If I actually took the time to get it) for what? a Cheal to be at fhps again?  Wizards lose their mana which isn't so easily replenished, so don't use that arguement, they are two different AA's.</P><P>"we really don't have much of an edge - but by your way of thinking that is good - we are tough necros we should suffer right?"</P><P>On raids I lich without penalty with regen spells, so throw this point out the window, we get more, therefor we have the edge.

You can't take criticism, yet when I agree with you you also cannot take that? Feel insecure about your points, hmm?  The epic is nice, and I went out of my way to purchase most of the pieces, yet many many many many necros cannot afford it, and if they are not in guilds that frequently go they cannot do their epics because the price is so high on the pieces.  Reading isn't against the law, you don't have to rush through it so noone sees you.</P><P>"..."Just like funeral pyre shouldn't be insanely common".

Because I think it might be nice if other players had a fair shot at it I am a whiner? Doesn't make much sense to me I'm afraid.</P><P>Because I would like necros below 60 to have a shot at landing their spells on mobs about as regulary as other classes of equivalent level I am whining? Hmm another strange conclusion. I am out of the 50's and my resist rate has dropped greatly, now that I want something better for my fellow necros who are still in the 50's I am whining? You claim my statement is false? Ok take a level 50 Necro and a level 50 wizard and get them to cast spells on an appropriate level raid type mob - such as Gorenaire or Woushi. The necro will have a resist rate so high that they really shouldn't bother being there. I know because I did this exact thing multiple times throught my 50's. I don't have penis envy for wizards because if I did I would play a wizard. But now that I am out of that situation and I would like to see things improved for other younger necros I am whining? Give me a break.</P><P>You repeatedly say I am whining? Because I want thing improved for other necros - not myself - I am a whiner? Right.</P><P>Kind of reminds me of a post I saw on Sony's board that was bitching about the fact that you could now meditate with your spellbook closed. He was basically saying "I had to go through it so everyone else should as well".  That pretty much sum's up Moonspires stance and seems to be the way you are heading as well Devoboy - a pity because from your response I can see you should be smarter than that. (good on you for defending your buddie moonspire, even if he is not worth defending doing so is honorable). </P><P></P><P><BR> </font></td>

You obviously can't read/write so well, because if you could you'd realize that we're both high level necromancers that obviously have to solo to get experience and obviously know about resists on mobs that we solo.  The many places that I have solo'd (in luclin, which includes but is not limited to ME, Acrylia, Akheva, FG, Ssra, etc.,) I have yet to see a mob that isn't 100% resistant, but yet resists a shit load of spells.  I have not seen a mob that is not 100% resistant to fire resists funeral pyre or pyrocruor or splurt or dooming darkness or epic or any of the soloing spells that a necromancer uses.  Here is a little statement for you to sit on for a few weeks, most of the people that VI design shit for are high level players, because they design shit for the customers that they can count on paying for a while, which are the customers who have been paying already for a while.  These are people who have many high level characters, people who like high level hard encounters.  Lowering resist checks on mobs just for lower level people would make the game gimpified.  If you're low level you should damn well have trouble landing spells... why you may ask?  Because you are LOW LEVEL and you are UNSKILLED at what you do.  VI isn't here to cater to people who will be playing for 4 months, they are here to cater to the people who stick with them through all of their shit.</P><P>Last statement of this thread incoming:</P><P>I know it won't be, but I wish PoP was level 60+ just to piss you fools off even more and maybe make you quit so we could do away with your idiotic points of view that if VI actually read and agreed with would screw the high end players out of the shit they really want.  Get a clue you fool, stay in school. (hey it rhymed I had to say it).  Learn to read, learn to listen, learn to be told what you've been missing.  You haven't seen what we have, you don't know what we do.  Just sit back and let the real necros do the negotiating with VI.  Thx la~, moo etc.,</P><P>EDIT: Ohh and if you come back with some raid mob resisting your spell, GOOD because you're a newb and you deserve it for casting the wrong spells on a mob.  Ask a wizard how many times GSS hits for less than 300, you'd be amazed.</P><P>Edited by - Moonspark on 09/28/2002  13:32:39</font></td>

I would rather verant said ok if you have an essence emerald you can use this spell to do a life tap once ever 2 hours, and same for the mana regen, rather than use up an emerald for these. The duck stick...I dont care if it looks like a duck. I wanna QUACK! I also want to be able to cast my friggen spells on mobs during raids. I'm a warlock damn it! I should be ohhhh so powerful and feared. I turn myself into a spector and make cool noises when I get hit and FD but what am I? Entertainment on the raid??? Mana ho? Common!

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> The only problems I see at the moment with my class, the necromancer is that verant geared us WAY too much for soloing.  We are like a bard but we lean towards solo much more.</P><P>We are the jack of all trades.  We can FD pull, slow (undead), mez (Kinda :p )  root,  regen mana at extremely fast rates, we can pump mana to other classes in a crisis (Though most of us don't like to because of the ratio), our dots when stacked do some mean damage, we can snare, we have some deadly pets, we have 2 spells for invulnerability, we can self succor, we can heal others and ourselves,<BR>we have a self rune (manaskin etc), we have a really good levitate along with some good resistance buffs to poison, disease, and cold.</P><P>All of this we can do but we are not masters of either of these skills.  We are a patchwork class that is used in groups when the ideal class for the job is unavailable.  </P><P>In raiding situations where efficiency is the key for success (Lag reasons) we are never a first pick over a monk, tank, wizzy, rogue etc.  When we do get into a raid where the mob will be fighting us for 10mins or more we deal godly damage.  Stack a few pyros, splurts etc, even that spell plague that we rarely will ever use hehe.  We can also cast a group bond of death which helps lots when the mobs we fight are AE casters.  Saves mana for the healers.</P><P>We are a good class but we do need fixing.  EQ is a grouping game and the post 50 game "boss" mobs are tough as hell where DPS means everything.  A necromancer isn't going to be the first choice for most any task unless it deals with undead encounters... even then we aren't always the first choice since other class' nukes land on undead just as good if not better than our undead only nukes.</P><P>I have seen our PoP skills and spells and I am not impressed.  I am also not impressed at how the cleric community complained enough to make it so their epic is almost a given epic now and other classes (Mage, Necro, bard etc) have to camp ultra rare mobs for theirs.</P><P>I enjoy my class but I would LOVE to group more than i am now.  Usually when I get a group it is because there is no healer and they need a fear kiter, or I am with my friends and they enjoy my company.</P><P>Spells drops are too rare as well IMO.<BR>Funeral Pyre is a CLASS DEFINING spell in my mind and should drop more frequently.  EoT should drop more as well.  We need that tanking pet after 10 levels without an upgrade.  I mean it takes a peridot to cast already, isn't that a big enough handi-cap?  22pp just to start hunting (Manaskin and pet)  If I go LD or pet dies another peridot goes down the tubes.  </P><P>I am tired of seeing level 60 spells for other classes costing only 2k whereas my spells cost 50k+ because of the rarity.</P><P>Every expansion our class gets left out / nerfed dramatically (All casters really)  PoP better be the caster's expansion.  Melee got it too good in RoK and SoV /nod</P><P>Make us desireable.  Make essense emeralds VENDOR bought too maybe 200pp per emerald maybe?.  Sacrifice, though great for role-playing, is a spell that isn't used at all hardly.  Or if a mob level 46+ is down to the last 10% health let us sac them for 0 xp and make the EE no drop.  Player's being sac'd produce a tradable EE for monk epic.  (Pretty sure they need one)</P><P>So! Love my class but tweak it out please!  </P><P>Just s few thoughts.<BR>Flame them if you want.  I don't care.<BR>Agree with them.  I don't care... as much :)</P><P><BR><img src="http://dabise.tripod.ca/shrieek4.jpg"></P><P><BR>Edited by - Shrieek on 10/03/2002  21:01:00</font></td>

But if you look at the original post time and the edited time you could see that it's edited minutes after the post, BEFORE any other posts.  Good try though, ohh and you really really need to take reading classes.  You called me an elitist which is in my book namecalling.  Also, your posts read as if you thought your opinion was the high and mighty opinion that is non negotiable and right, when in fact your opinion is only possessed by you.  If you haven't noticed, there aren't many real necros that post on these boards because of people like you.  People who can't distinguish their ass from their elbow, I have referred people in game to this thread to see if it was just me, not just friends, but necros serverwide, and not once have I gotten someone telling me that you are correct, not once have I gotten them telling me I went overboard.  You need to be put in your place, and I really don't want to be the person to do it.  Your points are all moot, you got nothing in this thread that I'd agree with save maybe 1 or 2 points out of 15.  I know I said I was done with this thread, but ohh well.  I don't need the respect from the people of this board.</P><P> </font></td>
