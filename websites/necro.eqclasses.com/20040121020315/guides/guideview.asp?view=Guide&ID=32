				So far there aren't a lot of true low-level guides, and definitely not for low-level human Necros. This is a 20 level guide for a Human Necro following Bertoxxulous, written with players new to Necromancy in mind.<br><br>As a member of the Bloodsabers, you start in Qeynos near the Arena. Follow the trail of bones through the arena, underground and through the tunnels to the Qeynos Aqueducts. It's dark, so make sure you have your candle equipped. Follow the tunnel until you see a gate to your right in a dead end. Through that gate is your guild.<br><br>Now that that's out of the way, head outside the gates until level 4. Standard stuff, watch the bugs because they gang up on you. Buy your pet spell, Cavorting Bones, to take mobs down quicker. Concentrate on rats and decaying skeletons, then gnoll pups and bats. Keep killing the skeletons for bone chips though.<br><br>At level 4 get Clinging Darkness, Poison Bolt, Fear, and Leering Corpse. Follow the road straight north from the gate to Qeynos Hills. In Qeynos Hills kill bigger rats, gnoll scouts, and whiskered bats. Clinging Darkness, send pet, Fear, Poison Bolt. Now you're fear kiting! Take on the gnolls around the Blackburrow entrance when you think you're ready. Watch out for adds. If you're brave, you might try a little just inside Blackburrow. You'll need to mix up letting your pet tank with a little melee yourself though, the level 4 pet is a poor tank and fear kiting inside will lead to a lot of trains.<br><br>At level 8 you have two options: go to West Karana and kite Giant Spiders and Giant Fire Beetles (Beetles hit harder, Spiders can poison). This is a good choice if you want to try tailoring, as you'll get spider silks and can kill lions for pelts.<br>Your other choice at 8 is to go inside Blackburrow and find Snake Ledge. Check the maps at EQAtlas. At the north end of the big pool on level 3 (the one marked The Pit on eqatlas) is an underwater tunnel. Swim through and climb the ladder out. You're on snake ledge. There will be 3-5 giant snakes here; they don't assist each other and you can fear kite them, because they won't cause the gnolls to aggro either. Just keep an eye on your pet (/pet report health) in case he gets poisoned. You should have a heal by now, so you can keep your pet alive if he does get poisoned.<br><br>At 12 get Heat Blood, Ward Undead and Spook the Dead if you didn't buy them already. Go to West Karana; turn right at the crossroads. At the end of the road you should be on the edge of a field. This is the Miller farm, or Scarecrow Field. Find an Animated Scarecrow (keep an eye out for Tiny Miller and stay far away from him. The edges of the field should be relatively safe). Kill the scarecrows with Engulfing Darkness, send pet, Heat Blood, Spook the Dead. Even though they con scowling, they do not aggro or assist. Throw Poison Bolt in if you want another DoT on them, and blast them with Ward Undead as long as you have enough mana (this will get your Evocation skill up). You should have Dark Pact by now to keep med time down, just Lifedraw or Leach occasionally to keep your hps up. This is an excellent spot until your next spell level, although the xp does start to slow down at 15.<br><br>Level 16: research. If you have any training points saved up, put them all into research. Also, hopefully you've been saving the Words those scarecrows dropped sometimes. Try to get your pet spell first. Also, you need to take a trip to Echo Caverns to buy Focus Death, your first pet buff. You can stay on Luclin to level in Paludal Caverns if you want now, but this guide is about the old continent so we'll go back.<br><br>Solo at 16, your best bet is aviaks in South Karana. Egrets and darters should be in your range; con everything and try to pull as far away from the trees as you can before you Fear. Now might be a good time to start practicing aggro kiting if you can get SoW or SoW potions. With aggro kiting, instead of using Fear, you try to load up your DOTs and get the mob mad at you, then run away while your pet hits from behind. SoW IS VERY IMPORTANT here, as even snared aviaks move too fast for you to get casting room. Try to run a circle or figure 8, and be sure to stay away from other mobs to avoid adds. The aviak's level progression (egret-darter-rook-harrier) should carry you easily into your mid 20s, when you can head just a short jog over to Split Paw.<br><br>The best thing about the places listed in this guide is that, with the exception of very new servers, they will be lightly camped at the worst. Even then, camps like the scarecrow field and aviak village are big enough and the mobs spawn fast enough to support multiple xp campers.<br><br>Markkos Toxxisius<br>&nbsp;<br>
