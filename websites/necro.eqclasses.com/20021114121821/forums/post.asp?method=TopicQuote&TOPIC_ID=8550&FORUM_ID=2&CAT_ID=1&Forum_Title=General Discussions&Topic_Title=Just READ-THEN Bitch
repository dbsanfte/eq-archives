Intresting.

Some Guides feel like taking Verant to Court. Tweety's BANNING is covered here.

Before I was bogged down with so much real life, it was my life as I'm sure many of you can equate to. It really sucks to see something like this happening to such a wonderful game, but it was expected. To all major companies consumers and their feeling don't mean shit. PR and CS is just a cover to ensure the customers they care about the never ending war making them happy. While you can't please everyone all the time, you should aim to please the majority all the time and I don't think Sony has ever considered this philosophy. You look at the things they have done, and I'm not just talking with this game, and you will get a glimpse of true capitilism. Because thats what this is all about after all isn't it ? Numbers ... we are all just figures on this weeks Excell spreadsheet that will be thrown away next week. As long as profit is steady over the overhead, there will always be these sorts of decisions happening. Where can they cut back to make more money ? </P><P>As much as the new team at Verant has done for us, Necros and the entire world of Norrath, nothing they can say or do will ever change the way large corporations run business. Especially one like Sony. With the exception of but a few major companies, the majority don't really care about if their customers are happy and just watch the flux of income every friday.</P><P>Everquest will not fail ... neither will Everquest 2 or Star Wars Galaxies or anything Sony will ever do ... because even though there is alot of bad, the good outweighs the bad. In my opinion there shouldn't even BE a bad side ... or at least there should be so much more good that the bad doesn't even seem that bad. </P><P>As soon as Squaresofr releases Final Fantasy Online I will put my chips with them. Countless times they have brought to their fans the quality and dependability they are so well known for.

Customer service is a non-revenue generating function.  The Guide Program requires VI to employ people to support it... which costs more money.

Although Severine was probably 100% accurate in her assessment of the problems at SOE/VI customer service, she should have sent her complaint to the top of SOE, not to the MBs.  By going public, now she embarrasses ALL of SOE/VI, and puts them all on the defensive.  Bad move.  Instead of gaining a high-level ally, she alienated everyone.  So in the eyes of the Powers that Be at VI and by her own naive admission on the MB, she became a loose cannon.  </P><P>Loose cannons either get lashed down or thrown overboard.  </P><P>And because her own superiors were so inept at management, they couldn't keep her under control.

Take your concerns and comments to those who are directly in charge of managing your guide program. Posting on message boards to vent frustrations can help you feel better, but if you truly have concerns over the success of the guide program, your efforts would be better spent taking it up with those in charge.</P><P>2-As a quasi-representative of the game and the game cmpany, your public statements directly affect the consumer's view of the company. If you are disgruntled with a volunteer program, making public negative statements is probably the worst thing you could do for yourself. Those responsible for the guide program would not be very impressed (even if your concerns are crucial and need to be addressed!)</P><P>3-If you find no way to resolve the issues you feel affect the quality of the program and are not getting the kind of action you deem necessary to improve the guide program, and still feel that major issues are just flat out wrong, then you should probably leave the program knowing that you tried to make it better and no one would listen (happens often with huge successful style companies) Better to fight to make the program better for all the great players out there internally first however. If you lose the battle and just can't take it, leave rather than making a public "rant" about it.<BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana" size=2 id=quote></P><P>VI/SOE's big, they know it.

Ok first thing to happen is all spending for that deptartment is cut back. People working for that deptartment no longer get raises and your manager treats you like crap cause he knows (you probably don't know that the dept is getting cut)that if you quit it will be easier on him if you leave cause he won't have to put up with you complaining about not getting what you were promised. Now the hardcore dedicated employees will stick it out till the end (call it loyalty) while the smart people see the deptartment starting to take a nose dive and get out quick and find another job that they are happy with.<BR> Do the loyalist get extra benifits for staying with said company? you bet they do, they get to be transfered to another part of the company where sooner or later the same shit will happen.

She obviously has problems with them, and no matter what, we can't do much about it. We could quit sure, but does that really solve the problem? How many people here will really quit? Can I really do much for her besides feel pity? Let me go ahead and answer these ... no, not many, and no.</P><P>2) I was a mud admin back in the day. Those were player run only, for no money or monetary gain, and very little appreciation for what you did. I eventually ran a mud myself which only magnifies those problems. What Sony has here is a case of greed plain and simple. They see things they are doing, decide they can make money for it, and then get rid of the volunteer only people who were doing it in the first place. Cases in point; server moves, name changes, and soon to be ... premium support.</P><P>The only thing that will eventually cause things to come crashing down is when people no longer have a good time playing the game. Revenues will dry up and by then, CS as an issue will be too late. Sad but true, people buy games every day that have shitty support.

The powers that be at micro$oft are actually trying and doing a good job of listening to their testers. There is no comparing EQ and AC2 graphics...AC2 is *breathtaking* and yes, you can quote me on that. Of course, I do play it with all settings at max. That will probably be my next addiction. Never played AC1, but from my understanding their CS was at least decent...better than EQ's has been on it's best of days. So far I have no complaints on the AC2 beta CS.</P><P>Oh well, as long as sony lets verant get away with this bs and continues to back them, many people will be too scared to tackle that beast.</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=264137" target="_blank" target="_blank">Charbonez Soulmark</a><BR>Clan Doomit<BR>Duzzil Ro</font></td>

(Didn't pay for either and one was level 51 at the time.) One was done within a day, the other took two months because our server GM was only on during certain times and my luck in getting past the Guides was based on whether they thought my reasons merited GM involvement. In the end I got what I wanted and didn't suffer a bit for it.</P><P>- I've had half a dozen corpses summoned from messed up places (And a few live bodies summoned from being stuck in walls etc.) usually within 10 minutes of petitioning my dilemma.</P><P>- I've had two Customer Service 100% rezzes when a wipeout or death was caused by the game and nothing I did.</P><P>- I've had gripes or disputes settled fairly (Not always in my favor, but fairly.) every time I've had to petition. (Maybe a half dozen times in 3 years.)</P><P>- I've had GM's reset/fix bugged mobs (Like Vox, Inny) always within 10-15 minutes of a petition.</P><P>- I've never had a petition go ignored.</P><P>Perhaps it's bad luck in general that some folks have, perhaps it's the wording of their petitions. (I know how frustrating things can get and sometimes taking a deep breath before composing a petition is a good idea.) Perhaps it's the customer service frustration levels on various servers, but I've had nothing but top notch customer service in my 3 years in Everquest and can't fault them for much at all personally.

I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure out that their CS absolutly sucks (in game at least), but the mistreatment of guides is something we haven't heard of yet.  I really hope this smartens up VI, but as for me it's too late because there is no way I'm going to support SWG or EQ2 (Shadowbane anyone??).  The other interesting thing is how Blizzard etc will capitalize on something like this.  Only time will tell.</P><P></P><P>Xararsis Shadowbearer</font></td>
