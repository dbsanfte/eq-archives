<br />

<br />
It was still dark, not a spark of light to show her where she was, just shadow all around, like a thick blanket smothering her. But who and where was she? Did it matter? She was here, swimming in the blackness. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">In the time that all was dark, Veeshan, the Winged Mother, came upon this world while hunting. She saw that it was rich and promising, and would nurture her great children, and so here laid her eggs.</span> 
<br />

<br />
A slight buzzing began, slowly swelling to a roar, voices, thousands of them, raised together. A spark flared up in the distance... 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Creeping Coward Brell Serilis discovered her nest, and through treacherous cunning made pacts with the other gods to steal the world from the Winged Mother.</span> 
<br />

<br />
She cringed, shielding her ears from the deafening sound, her eyes squinting, trying to adjust to even the smallest light in her dark prison. The velvet blackness seemed to go on forever, as if she could walk and walk and never find the end. But that small spark slowly grew closer... 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The gods in their council said "Let us not speak of this to Innoruuk, for He is great, but by trickery we may have what is rightfully his, as well. </span>
<br />

<br />
Eyes unused to sight began to water as the light became stronger and larger, moving towards her alarmingly. One part of her wanted to run, but to where? There was no end to her prison.. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Then the gods covered the world with their worms, and these worms crawled to all the corners of the world, and grew into the Others.</span> 
<br />

<br />
And the light became a form, and her heart burned in hatred and fear. His shape was familiar, one that she could never escape. Her god, her jailor, her tormentor... 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">But Our Father could not be deceived, nor can He be thwarted. </span>
<br />

<br />
The voice seemed to surround her, batter her with its resonance... and tear her open from the inside out. "So, Evileene, have you learned that you can naut defy me?" 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">He took for His own the first Queen and King of all the Elves from their thrones at Takish-Hiz. He led them from Tunare, the False Mother. He lifted them from their ignorance and showed them His Will. </span>
<br />

<br />
She nodded wordlessly, the defiance that still sparked in her eyes pushed down. He had already proven He would win, not she. To fight Him was foolish. "Answer me child. Have you learned to Hate? Do you remember who you are?" 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">We are their children. We are the instruments of Our Father's Will. We shall destroy the offspring of the false gods and cleanse the world of their treachery. We will deliver this world to Our Father.</span> 
<br />

<br />
She gasped, drawing great breaths of air through lungs that had not been used in ages. Her eyes blurred and teared painfully as they adjusted to her surroundings, stone walls and candles and wooden benches... tier'dal faces all around. Hands all around lifting her up, sitting her upright on the cold stone, goosebumps raising on her skin as more hands wrapped her in a rough cloth. The sensations of the physical world battered her senses... and her voice, for the first time in forever she heard it.. 
<br />

<br />
"I am born Necromancer. My hand is the Hand of Innoruuk, the Dead shall not rest in His service..." 
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Bodies crowded all around, pushing her towards a spot in the room, almost as if they were herding cattle. Soft fabrics, satins, silks, brushing against her, the sensations overwhelming after the time spent imprisoned in a world without substance. Finally, they were still. She was huddled close to several others. Rough, threadbare wool was what she felt brushing against her now, from both the garment draped around her own form, and the tier'dal she was pressed against. The smell of fear hung heavy around the group, but after so long as a tortured soul in the Father's realm, little could frighten her now. Only going back there had the power to do that... 
<br />

<br />
Her eyes gazed downward, still unfocused, still unused to their corporeal form. How long had it truly been? Sharp pains shot through her head as she fought to clear her vision. It was as if she was an infant again, learning to see. The chanting hurt her ears as well, but it was almost a welcome pain, to actually HEAR again, for the sounds to reverberate through her body and resonate around her. Even as the rough wool scratched and irritated her skin, she welcomed the feel of it, the reminder that she was alive. She took a deep breath relishing the feel of her lungs filling with air, and froze. There was a familiar scent in the air, rising above the fear and incense in this chapel.  Blood.  It soaked the stones, dyed the altar she had just been laying on.  Death.
<br />

<br />
The throng pushed her forward with the others clad in the same rough robes.  She could hear those herded with her mumbling prayers beneath their breath, their terror almost delicious to her after so long with only her own fears to feed on.  What seemed like hundreds of eyes peered at them, the slight red glow of their ultravision almost seeming to add an eerie light to the darkened church. One jaluk in a woolen robe was shoved forward and landed heavily on his knees in front of the Priest. The Priest spoke up, his voice quiet, yet carrying throughout the room. 
<br />

<br />
"Great are the Children of Innoruuk. Great is Our Father. His Will is Our Will, our strength is His Strength. May Our Father look down upon Us as We gather here, for this night He shall reclaim those children that were lost." 
<br />

<br />
The jaluk before him was lifted roughly to his feet. The Priest looked at him dispassionately, then raised his eyes to the image of the Eye of Innoruuk, magically suspended over the altar. 
<br />

<br />
"Hear me, Our Father. Consider this Child that stands before Us. They have defied You and listened to the lies of the Others, but they have returned, properly penitent, for Your Use. Allow them to plead for acceptance, for they are Your Creation, and deserve only to live in Your Servitude." 
<br />

<br />
His attention turned back to the jaluk before him. 
<br />

<br />
"Do you, Uuananyen Z'Rist, wish to submit yourself willingly to the Eye of Our Father, so that you may be found worthy to join His True Service?" 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Eve watched spellbound, finally aware of why they were all there that evening, why Innoruuk had brought her back.  She too would be expected to stand before the Priest and the Church and declare her faith and obedience to the God that had tormented her all these years, the one God she could not escape, even in death... 
<br />

<br />
"Do you admit to the superiority of the Power of Innoruuk, bow to Him as your one True Father, and swear to live and die for His Will?" Z'Rist nodded his head quietly, his eyes fixed on the Priest before him. Eve's eyes were drawn to a commotion she saw in a far corner of the room, where someone was being brought in through a small door... a fier'dal, bound and gagged, dressed in the white robes of a sacrifice. Her stomach tightened at what she guessed was about to happen. Z'Rist was still fixated on the Priest.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"Do you swear to follow and uphold the Commandments of Obedience in every thought, word, and deed?" 
<br />

<br />
Z'Rist nodded again, a slight hesitance in the movement. 
<br />

<br />
"Do you swear to serve Our Queen and King, as embodiments of the Will of Innoruuk?" 
<br />

<br />
Another silent nod. 
<br />

<br />
"Do you swear to reject the lies of love and free will taught by the Lying Gods?" 
<br />

<br />
Still unaware of the fier'dal, Z'Rist slowly nodded his head. A malicious grin spread across the Priest's mouth. He turned to look at the bound elf, dragging Z'Rist's attention to her as well. The jaluk sagged, almost dropping to his knees in horror, as he saw his wife pushed onto the sacrificial altar... 
<br />

<br />
"Bwael, then as a follower of the True God, you will have nau trouble dispatching this female that you have agreed that you do naut love?" Z'Rist was handed a dagger, and a low, evil chuckle rose in the Priest's throat.
<br />

<br />
The shadows in the church seemed more sinister than ever, and even the candlelight had a threatening aura, the cold stone walls almost seeming to breathe, as if the place itself was a living being of evil. The altar the fier'dal lay upon was cold stone, the same bloodstained surface that Eve had been laid out upon seemingly only moments ago. The floor all around it was stained with blood, the life force of countless victims of all races mixed together here. Z'Rist had eyes for nothing but the slender elf, draped in white, like a virgin sacrifice. That robe would soon be crimson with blood, he knew. Her golden eyes met his in fear and a certain kind of resignation... she knew what her fate was to be, whether at her lover's hands, or at the hands of one of these around her. If by his hand, at least he might be spared. She spoke softly, in the language of her own people, a tongue he knew well. "Do it.. now. Do not let my life end by their hands, but yours." 
<br />

<br />
Her request chilled another in the church that day as well, for she well understood that forbidden tongue. What horrors were unfolding before her eyes, here, at her rebirth. But Z'Rist knew nothing of what was in her heart, nor did he care. His only thoughts were for Ayllysa. His wife. His downfall. His end. He knew what he must do, but he could not force his arm to move, to complete the downward stroke, to drain the life from those eyes. 
<br />

<br />
The tier'dal looked at the bound wood elf, panic in his eyes. His nerveless fingers dropped the dagger he had been handed, and it fell, clattering noisily on the stone floor, though he heard not a sound. Calmly, one of those who had brought her in reached for his own dagger, cutting her open from throat to belly in one clean stroke, her keening cry echoing throughout the room. Z'Rist made a move for the guard, insane with fear and grief, and the Priest calmly thrust a dagger he had been concealing in his robes into the jaluk's heart, giving it a sharp twist, then pulling it back, the three ornate and razor sharp prongs taking the still-beating heart with them as they were removed. Z'Rist collapsed silently to the floor, the blood from his corpse mixing with that of his forbidden bride and all the other victims of this evil place. Dropping the now-still heart to the ground next to him, the Priest laughed maliciously. "You are nau follower of Innoruuk. May you serve Him better in death than you did in life." 
<br />

<br />
"Heed my words! The Father does naut lie. He tells Us from the outset what the penalty for betraying the Will is, He does naut preach false forgiveness and empty promises. He does naut lie and tell Us we have free will, and the right to choose Our Path. His Will is Our will, and we ARE His Will. To turn your back on that is a crime against Father and tier'dal. However, Innoruuk is naut without mercy to His Children. Those who are truly willing to come back into the Will shall be forgiven, and their trespasses forgotten. Those who attempt to deceive Him shall suffer the fate of this one."<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by Evileene Diablerie on Wed Feb 02, 2005 2:12 am; edited 1 time in total</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">His piercing red eyes moved over those in the congregation, settling menacingly on Eve.  A short nod of his head motioned her forward and for the first time since being reborn, she felt fear again.  Fear of being returned to the Abyss and to the domain of Hate, fear of being nothing but a soul trapped in Innoruuk's prison for all of eternity.
<br />

<br />
What the others'  tests were to be, Eve did not know. Her eyes were fixed on the priest's glowing red eyes, the malevolence in them warning her that she had an unpleasant surprise in store. She had been separated from the others, with them held securely back, watching, as she had watched Z'Rist.  Eve stared at the man in front of her, his lips twisted into an evil smile, and held back a shudder. It did not do to show fear to one such as this, the scent of blood would only whip him into more of a frenzy. His indigo skin glowed in the flickering candlelight, his face almost handsome but for the utter cruelty in every line and shadow. Although, among most of their people, that would be considered an asset. 
<br />

<br />
"Are you ready, Ilharess?" The title was spoken in a mocking tone, the former power she had wielded at odds with the helpless situation she now found herself in. Her hands curled into fists, the nails biting into her palms, to the point of drawing blood. Forget self-preservation, her pride would not let her show any fear to the arrogant bastard in front of her. 
<br />

<br />
"I am ready." Though inside she was shivering in terror of all that had gone before and what was about to happen, her voice was cold and emotionless. She shook her guards off and stood there, waiting.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">The jalil, only 50 years of age, still barely more than a child by tier'dal standards, raced to the Oasis of Marr with all the speed she could muster. A sister of her qu'ellar was in trouble, a rivvil monk tormenting her and threatening her, and there was nauthing else to be done but rush to her defense. But what could one such as she still young in the craft do? 
<br />

<br />
The rivvil stood over the terrified wizard, young Aeslin did naut have the courage or backbone most tier'dal had, and prized. But then, she was also a member of the Spurned, almost expected to be weaker, to be a burden. Evileene called upon her skeleton companion, but it was easy to see he would be little to nau help against this one. The sun was blinding to the tier'dal girls, alien and uncomfortable, and they were disoriented in the bright light. 
<br />

<br />
A brighter glare caught her eye, and she glanced over, visibly relaxing as she saw one of the elders of the qu'ellar, a warrior named Zaknyfein. His silver armor shone brilliantly in the sun, blinding the monk momentarily. The tone of Zak's voice and his hold on his weapons quickly convinced the bully he meant what he said. "You will leave my sisters alone, rivvil iblith. Or you will feel my blade. Begone, while I still have hold of my temper." 
<br />

<br />
Perhaps that was the moment she was lost, Eve reflected much later. She had always thought that the pale dream of a knight in shining armor to rescue the maiden was foolish, and the maiden was altogether too weak if she could naut save herself. But perhaps there was something to that... </span>
<br />

<br />
The tier'dal that was dragged. hands bound before him, towards the altar bore little resemblance to the brave warrior rescuer of so long ago. He had changed enough that she could have been forgiven for not knowing him, so many years and such a difference from the proud but kind tier'dal he had been. He was stooped, weak. His spirit had been broken long ago it seemed, his ivory hair yellowed and hanging lank against his shoulders. This then was her hell... her sacrifice. The man she had spoken vows to, lived with, laughed with, had a daughter with... the man she had loved, who had turned her on this path in the first place. His eyes met hers, dull and glassy, but she saw a spark of remembrance, of recognition... and then of dissappointment.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Rage built up inside her, almost like a fire, an inferno of hatred. Innoruuk's emotion, Innoruuk's control. "I almost let you destroy me!" she hissed in a rage. "I was weak, pathetic, all in the name of the lie you sold me. Love!" She spit at his feet.
<br />

<br />
His pathetically stooped body straightened momentarily, his bowed head upright again in an almost sad showing of pride. Too little, too late. "I did naut destroy you Eve. They did. They did." His voice shook slightly. "And you did. The woman you were when we met.. so young, so innocent, so full of life. And Innoruuk and His teachings took that away. Slowly, so slowly you did naut even see, you became another woman. Twisted, bitter, angry. So full of Hate. But I saw. All too well I saw, I watched it. And it destroyed me too..." His blue eyes shimmered with tears, with grief over what had been, and what could have. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">The tier'dal woman looked up at her mother, ebony eyes misty with a sheen of tears. "There is nauthing left to you, Ilharess. Naut but hate, and a lust of power. You do naut need me, you need nau one. At least Father needs me. He loves me. All I hear from you is duty, your duty to Innoruuk, your duty to Neriak. What of your duty to me? To Father? You have abandoned us for your god, and to your own fears. I lost my family, but at least I tried to hold them together. At least I tried to love! You just allow Innoruuk and his teachings to twist you further every day." 
<br />

<br />
The Ilharess glanced around, worried that others may have overheard the conversation. "Zarynne! This is naut the time, daughter. We shall talk later--" 
<br />

<br />
"There will be nau later, Ilharess. Aluve." </span>
<br />

<br />
"This is who we are Zak! This is what we were created for. Innoruuk is our Father, we are His tools. It was you who lost that!" The rage was fading slowly, replaced by almost hopelessness. Memories battered her mercilessly, regrets slipped past her careful defenses, weaking her further. Centuries since she had seen him, and this was what he had become. There was no hope for anyone, no hope. She had thought he of all that she knew would break free. Would live away from this Hate. But even he... "And look at you. Just look. Give me one reason why I should naut put you out of your misery." 
<br />

<br />
"Put me out of my misery, Eve? Or out of your life, your mind. Forget again, and forget our daughter, and forget all that happened. Become a puppet again. Rest easily, and breathe so long as He allows you to, so long as you amuse Him. Kill me." 
<br />

<br />
Her whole body slowly began to shake, the memories drowning her deep in their depths. "I have nau choice, I have tried to escape before and failed. I have tried to break the tie and failed." Her hands trembled so violently she almost couldn't grasp the knife the priest handed her, his amusement at the scene palpable.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-style: italic">The little girl patted her cheek. "Ilhar... mommy! Wake up, mommy! Someone is knocking at the door!" Eve stirred slowly, then snapped awake as the sound of mailed fists pounding worked its way into her consciousness. What the vith..? 
<br />

<br />
Picking up the five year old, and holding her on one hip, she moved towards the door, peering out. The Spire guard? What had happened.. She threw the door open, cradling the child. 
<br />

<br />
"What is it? What is wrong?" 
<br />

<br />
The head guard just looked at her, a hard expression in his eyes. "We have been sent for the child. She is to come with us now." 
<br />

<br />
"Wha.. why?" Eve looked at him in confusion. This was a man she saw every day when she brought Kieryn to the Spires. She had baked him food, and shared gossip and jokes. Why was he acting so cold? "Let me get us both dressed, and I will bring her." 
<br />

<br />
Rough hands reached for the child, pulling her out of her mother's grasp. "Nau, we come for her, naut you. She belongs to the Spires now, you have done your duty." Nodding to the other guards, he began to walk off with Kieryn, while the others barred Eve's way. The child started to cry, screaming for her mother. The woman in the doorway fought with all her strength, screaming her daughter's name. One of the guards looked at her, something approaching pity in his eyes, then turned his face away. Once the screams of the little one could no longer be heard, they stepped back and let her go. 
<br />

<br />
When the rough hands holding her released, Eve dropped in a heap to the ground, staring up at them, dazed and shaken. 
<br />

<br />
"Evileene Mahadrel, you will nau longer be allowed into the Spires. Your Hate has been measured, and found lacking. You will naut be allowed to infect the Child with your weakness. Do naut attempt to take her back, it will naut go well." 
<br />

<br />
The tormented woman watched them walk away, the strength finally coming back to her legs. Whimpering like a whipped puppy, she walked slowly to the Third Gate, moving as if she had numbered two thousand years, rather than her two hundred. As she approached the Spires, the screams of her daughter once again became audible, and forgetting everything, including the warning she was given, she ran for the entrance, intent on saving her little girl. A guard stepped in front of her, then another, staves at the ready. There was pain, much pain.. then nothing... </span>
<br />

<br />
"Touching, Ilharess. Very touching, but I grow bored. Finish it." 
<br />

<br />
The shaking stopped, a sudden strength of purpose coming over the woman standing there, torn in half. Over and over she had lost, with Innoruuk at the center of each tragedy, Innoruuk the cause. And now he would make her a murderer? Make her kill one that was helpless, make her break the Commandments she had lived for? But then, what was one more loss? The dagger was raised high, its blade already stained with blood, and slashed quickly and efficiently through its target. The ropes binding Zak's arms landed at his feet, the man moving with lightning quickness, grabbing the weapon of the guard next to him and swinging it with all the grace and skill she remembered. "You will die, Zak, but you will die free... as am I." Chaos erupted around them his blade swinging around, doing the most damage he could inflict, already wounds slashing red all over his body.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

She gated to another area of the Third Gate, near the forge that she had used so often, and then knelt down, pulling a small and ornate coffin from her packs. A few mystic words murmured, and she was holding her husband's bloody and lifeless corpse, her head bowed for a moment in grief, then steely resolution filling her eyes. She kissed his forehead, brushing his hair back from his face one last time. <span style="font-style: italic">Goodbye, Zak... may you find your peace.</span> Letting go of him she stood, ignoring the blood and gore that now covered the ill fitting robe she wore. She took a few steps forward and she was there, in a small, rarely used chapel, one that only those in V'Umbra had ever really used. Back to the beginning.. 
<br />

<br />
"I passed your test, Father! He is dead... and I killed him. Oh, naut with my own hands, but I knew what the result would be, and so did you." Her voice shook with anger and despair. "They brought him to me bound and helpless. I am NAUT a murderer. I do your will but I am naut a monster." Her fingernails dug into her palms as she shouted at the altar, willing Him to answer. "What of your Commandments, Father? What of them? Thou shall naut raise hand, word or sword against another tier'dal! Your priests demand we break those commandments, and for what? To prove our loyalty? I have bled for you, I have fought for you! I have lost everything I care about... FOR YOU! Over and over I have sacrificed. I am only what you made me. That is all I can be! When will it be enough? If I am soft, if I am too gentle, if I care too deeply, then look to Yourself for blame. I am Your Child, Your Creation. I know that You hold the power over my life. I know that Free Will is naut mine. But I can only be who You made me, naut someone else. If that is naut enough, take this life now and be done with it." Her shoulders sagged forward, her bloodstained hands reaching up to wipe tears she had not realized she was crying. "Thy Will be done."<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

There was still pride in her bearing, or perhaps it was that there was AGAIN pride in her bearing, she who had finally given up not long ago. Her spine straightened, showing a sense of purpose again. If she had been the kind that could summon fires and lightning bolts she would have, in her Hate. "Why should I expect YOU to answer, you have never answered. Ever the puppetmaster, and all of us your loyal brainless puppets. Did I fail, just because I did naut perform this task as you wished? The job was still finished, and I knew the outcome! I am guilty too. But because I could naut change my nature, did I fail? You do naut want children, you want dolls. Living, moving, unthinking DOLLS. I am nau doll, I am tier'dal. I breathe. I feel. I HATE. My Hatred is strong now, you should be proud.." For the first time she seemed to notice the gore covering her. She stripped off her robe, ignoring the fact that there was nothing underneath it. She walked, slowly, purposefully, without shame to the river that ran all through Neriak, and waded in, cleansing her body from the filth, though she feared her soul would never be clean. In the corner of her mind, she noticed a young jalil watching her, but could not bring herself to speak, not yet. 
<br />

<br />
A voice came from behind her, soft and low.  An old friend, a lover, an enemy and a confidante, all rolled into one.  Somehow the two of them could never get completely untangled from each other, and she was not surprised he was here.  Looking down at her he spoke slowly, "Eve... what can i do?"
<br />

<br />
She just watched him mutely, her eyes black pools in her face.  "I can help you forget Eve.  You have little respect for my tricks of the mind, I know, but I can ease your pain."<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Rather than cross her arms to hide her nudity, she stands proudly, arms akimbo. "I do naut want to lose my sadness, or my pain. It makes me who I am, and it is a tribute to those who have been lost. If I let it go, I am tarnishing their memory."
<br />

<br />
She looks at him, as if seeing him for the first time. "I belong here, Alger. I belong to Innoruuk, and I accept that. I hate Him with every fiber of my being, and that is how it should be. And I am hurt and I am tested, and that is how things are. You do naut belong here, abbil. You are naut truly one of His Children. You have naut been twisted by this Hate yet. Leave while you still can."
<br />

<br />
She turns around, wading deeper into the water, slowly, gracefully. With water to her shoulders, she pauses and looks back at him, her short white locks slicked back against her head, tears washed clean from her face. "You and Zaknyfein would have been friends, I think. He believed like you did, that there was something else for us. And he never let the Hate touch him. His body lies in the chapel nearby. Please take him, and perhaps have someone say a few words over him before you dispose of his corpse? I will naut raise that one again for Innoruuk's purpose. He deserves to be free of it all now, at least." A small smile curves her lips as she watches him for a moment, then swims deeper, turning over on her back to float, and staring up at the mystic images that glowed throughout the air, effectively dismissing him. Her eyes were dry now, and clear.
<br />

<br />
She noticed movement in the shadowy area of the bank and saw a young jalil there that looked familiar...<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I hope that we did naut discomfit you. I assure you, I am naut the lunatic I might seem today."  The tier'dal girl looked up at her, the familiarity striking her even more.  She knew this child somehow... her name... Jhinrae, xas, that was it.  She stepped closer, a breath away from the jalil now.
<br />

<br />
Her hand threaded through the girl's ebony locks almost unconsciously, a faraway look in her eyes. "So young, so innocent. Do naut stay that way too long, dalharil. All those illusions.. the longer you believe, the more it hurts when they are revealed, and the more He holds you. Tis better.. or at least easier.. to be old, cynical, and heartless."
<br />

<br />
She reached up and ripped a cloth flag off of a sign pole, some sort of advertisement for one of the local shops. Wrapping it around herself, she walks away from the water, her shoulders stiff and proud, her bearing regal. Jhinrae had to strain to hear what she said as she walked towards the Hall of the Dead. "I forget that far too often..." 
<br />

<br />
Jhinrae called after her, stopping her in her tracks.  "Why do you feel such scorn for the Father, and why does he punish you as such, Mistress?"  She flushed slightly.  "I overheard you in the Chapel, and then followed you here.  I am naut sure why, I am naut usually the type to eavesdrop.."
<br />

<br />
Eve stopped where she was standing, and sat down on the stone path, patting the spot next to her. This one was curious, to be sure, and still so naive in the ways of her people. A laugh bubbled out from her throat, low and musical. "Naut in your nature, dalharil? Why of course it is, you're tier'dal. It's in your BLOOD." As the girl approached and sat down, Eve reached out and smoothed a piece of hair back from Jhinrae's face, caressing her cheek in an almost motherly manner.
<br />

<br />
"You do know the story of our creation, dalharil? Of how the original king and queen of the elves were kidnapped by the Father? Of how for hundreds of years He tortured them, mentally and physically, excrutiating pain, until He had twisted them into what we are today. The 'perfect' tier'dal." Her mouth twisted bitterly. "He tortures even His most devout followers. That is His nature. He feeds on Hatred, even ours for Him." Absently, she starts finger combing the girl's hair, taken back to the times of having her own child.
<br />

<br />
"That is naut to say I do naut follow him, dalharil, for I do. He is my Father, and I am His Living Will. But He wants my Hatred and yours as much as He wants the Hatred of the Others. I have lost two... well, three... daughters, and my husband to His Will. I have died for His Will. I have been raised for His Will."<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Jhinrae heard the raw pain in the older woman's voice and knew that this story would be excruciating for her to tell, but for some reason, she needed to hear it, needed her answers.  Almost hesistantly, Jhinrae asked, "Three daughters and your husband all for the sake of His will? I do naut understand what you mean."
<br />

<br />
A frown furrowed her brow as she spoke further, "You asked how familiar I was with our origins, sadly I am naut. I understand Him feeding on our hatred to further his own, but I do naut understand why he would force you to sacrifice your family for His will."
<br />

<br />
She waited for her answers, scarcely daring to breathe.  She did not wait long.
<br />

<br />
"I can see myself in you dalharil. I was as young once, I think. Perhaps even more naive, because I had the delusion that I was a woman of the world and that I knew our Father and what He would want of His Children. I still thought of Him as a Father who protects and cares for His offspring." The laugh she gave sounded almost genuinely amused. "What a little wael I was."
<br />

<br />
She pulled her knees up to her chest and wrapped her arms around them, her short locks tousled and spiky from her swim. Suddenly the woman with the attitude and bearing of a queen looked like a lost child. "I came from humble origins, nau noble qu'ellar or name for me. The first ellar I joined was Undraeth. It was shaky though, and intrigue started to erode its crumbling foundation. But there I met my husband, Zaknyfein. He was someone I would have sworn would never look twice at me, I had naut even risen to the 16th rank in the Dead before he asked for my hand in marriage, he was a seasoned warrior, brave and strong. Gentle. Loving." Her eyes were focused on something only she could see. "He did naut Hate, but then neither did I, naut then. I only thought I did. There is a difference, you know.
<br />

<br />
"And we had a child, a daughter, and named her Zarynne. And as she started growing, wonderful things started to happen to me. I was named an elder in Undraeth. I became someone that people looked up to. I had gained skill and renown in armor crafting as well, and that followed me to my next qu'ellar, Veldrin, after Undraeth finally collapsed. Suddenly it seemed that this small unimportant jalil had Innoruuk's favor, and it was a heady idea to be sure. I was nearly drunk on the power.
<br />

<br />
"And from the fall of Veldrin was born Qu'ellar V'Umbra. I was second in charge there. I negotiated treaties with the other qu'ellaren. I officiated at ceremonies. Eventually I became Ilharess. And through it all, I felt Innoruuk's favor. I didn't realize what I was sacrificing though. First my husband. I never saw him, I was always too busy. And he did naut believe. He was an "embarrassment". He was friends with pales. He spoke openly of love. And so, ever mindful of my "position", I divorced him. That act separated Zarynne and I as well. She never spoke to me again. Soon after, she disappeared."
<br />

<br />
The words were spoken calmly, flatly, without any depth or tone to them at all, but her eyes shone bright with remembered pain. She took a deep breath, nerving herself up to continue. "Well, they say confession is good for the soul, do they naut, dalharil?"<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by Evileene Diablerie on Wed Feb 02, 2005 2:19 am; edited 1 time in total</span></td>

<br />

<br />
Eve smiled tremulously at the jalil, shaking her head gently. "Nau, dalharil. This is something you may as well understand sooner rather than later. Even those who have His favor, He plots against. If we became too happy, too complacent, our Hate lessens, and He feeds on it, He needs it. Do naut confer the qualities of a pale god on the Father. He cares only for our use to Him, naut us as flesh and blood, or souls. And if one lets pride or arrogance grow too strong, the price will be all the more. Sometimes more than can be born."
<br />

<br />
The air around them almost seemed to stop moving, utter silence, as if the walls themselves were listening to her story. She shifted slightly, the rough stone beneath her digging into tender flesh hardly protected by the thin swatch of fabric she had swaddled herself in. Here, in this place, she could almost smell Innoruuk. The hate and malice were thick here, like a fog, they seeped from the walls, and rose like tendrils from the cobblestone streets. She raised an imaginary glass in salute to him, knowing the child before her probably though she was stark raving mad. Of course, that might not be far from the case.
<br />

<br />
"I loved my new title and new station. Tier'dal bowing and kneeling to me. My name known throughout Neriak, and even through parts of the other cities. The adulation, the power.. it even convinced me I did naut miss my family so much. I did naut need them. I was Ilharess. Like I said earlier, dalharil. I was a wael.
<br />

<br />
"And then I started getting vengeful. The power I had? Anyone who had ever wronged me, I could even the score now. I seduced a jaluk. A married jaluk. His wife had tried to steal my husband, so I set out to steal hers. I enjoyed his company in my bed, but I was using him. And breaking a trust, for his wife was a member of my own qu'ellar. And I became pregnant for the second time. So rare for our people. We are naut a fertile lot. In my spite, I told him of the child, and then told him he would never get to see it, hold it, have anything to do with it. I knew that would destroy him, you see, for he doted on his other children.
<br />

<br />
"The birth of my daughter softened me, though. She was so perfect, a gift in every way. Kieryn was a delight to me. And so I relented, and gave Kerath... yes, I know you know the name.. a place in her life. Until the day the soldiers came..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"I know of Kerath, but I only know of one daughter, Lierin..."
<br />

<br />
Eve smiles sadly. "Naut many know of her. Fewer know that Kerath is her father. Lierin only found out after my death, perhaps that is part of what sent her over the edge of sanity..."
<br />

<br />
She looked at the girl, her eyes searching, as if to be sure Jhinrae was prepared to hear the rest of her story. "I didn't raise Kieryn in the tier'dal tradition. She was raised by me. Actually, all of my qu'ellar helped, she was an adorable child and they all watched out for her and watched her grow. When she was perhaps five years old, the guards of the Spires came to my door, and they said they were there for Kieryn. That was normal, there had been a prophesy that she would be able to do something nau other tier'dal had ever done, what that was nau one knew. The Oracle as usual was vague. But the Spires watched her closely because of that."
<br />

<br />
Her eyes dropped to the ground, remembered pain dulling her eyes. Her long, slender indigo-skinned fingers knotted together awkwardly, her hands shifting in distress. Her toes curled, pulling back under the cloth she was draped in, as if she was trying to pull back into herself. "That day was different however. The guards, jaluken I had talked to, joked with, even baked for, they said I was naut welcome to come with her. That I was naut going to see Kieryn again. That my faith had been judged and found lacking. That my Hate was false..." She licked suddenly dry lips. "When I ran after them, I heard my daughter screaming for me, then the guards blocked my path. They.. they beat me into unconsciousness, and left me there. I never saw Kieryn again. I left Neriak soon after." She glanced off in the distance, her eyes closed briefly, then opened again, carefully blank of all emotion. 
<br />

<br />
"I had fought so hard against the Kindred and the vampires. There was a day in Nektulos when Syriux, Hallistra and myself challenged them. Members of all three qu'ellars came to support us. Hallistra fought Aquaenus, the sire. I was particularly furious, for he had turned one of my abbilen, another tier'dal, into an abomination like himself. But that is a story for another day.. I had fought hard against them, yet I let them become a haven to me when I fled Neriak. I knew Aquaenus would take me in, for you see I had had private dealings with him as well, to my shame."
<br />

<br />
One hand raked through her short locks, setting them even more on end, the look wild and spikey. Her eyes too were wild, wide and dilated, her emotions obviously at the breaking point. She almost seemed to forget Jhinrae was there at times, just stumbling through her story, the words coming out in a jumble, a catharsis perhaps.
<br />

<br />
"And so I joined the Kindred, but I was naut turned. I refused to become a vampire. That would have been a betrayal of everything I knew. They let me hide away in a cabin, rather than the Keep, and I rarely saw or spoke to anyone. Lierin and Kerath's wife, Raevynne, came with me, but I shut them out as well."<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
