				ORIGINAL POST BY: Ickhor Von Memnoch from Brell Serilis Server<br><br>With the release of PoP, lots of content in the old world was bound to be trivialized, but did VI know the extent of the trivialization?<br><br>When I first looked over our PoP spells, something instantly popped into my mind as amazingly powerful. That something was not a spell itself, but a loop of spells.<br><br>I turned it over in my mind until I got the needed spells, and once I got them I did a bit of testing. I have come up with a hypothesis: I can kill standard ( that doesnt do anything crazy like banish you to a well, not that I'm saying I could solo dain ) mob, as long as it doesnt do more than 1000 damage in 12 seconds, even if it has 100 million HP. I will have near-FM at the end of the fight.<br><br>I'm sure you all have figured my loop out already. Did Verant actually consider the insane mana regen given by seduction of saryrn in respect to the low mana cost and specialization of touch of death?<br><br>With Seduction of Saryrn and level 65 med alone, I can get 150 mana in two ticks, that is usually more than enough to cast a ToD ( 250 base cost, specialize and SCM 3 lower cost alot ). In fact, I have just enough mana left over to cast Saryrn's Kiss to offset the health loss!<br><br>So how can this work for you? There are many places in pre-PoP ( Doesnt work well in PoP because damage output is insane compared to old stuff ) that this tactic can be employed. Many places that used to take solid groups or even raids can now be soloed by a single necromancer.<br><br>One of my favourite places to do this was in the City of Mist, the Black Reavers. Reaver raids were the bane of casters for the longest time for this reason: Reavers are completely immune to magic. I love the poetic justice that one of the classes that was useless on reaver raids in the past is now the only class that can solo them with any effeciency at all. However, one can argue that it isnt soloing because you have to have a rogue to open the door. The rogue will not have to engage any mob though.<br><br>You need:<br>1) Seduction of Saryrn<br>2) Legacy of Zek ( Not sure if CoB would work as I dont have it yet and am not familiar with its mitigation )<br>3) Touch of Death<br>4) Saryrns Kiss<br>5) A rogue to open the door, can either be 2boxed, a friend, or you can pay someone in the zone off to let you in.<br><br>You are going to have to modify the loop a bit here for one reason, the reavers are completely immune to magic. So you have to have something else to get your health back. I reccomend holgresh elder beads if you have them. If not, you can slow a newbie undead mob, and tank it during the fight while you keep saryrn's on.<br><br>Also of note, black reavers proc a pretty long duration blind. Do not get in melee with them. If your pet should step out of melee and is blinded, he will act like he is feared until he gets back in melee. This should only happen when the reaver dies however, and shouldnt really matter as you can just use Summon Companion when the fear wears off ( Unengaged pets no longer draw aggro anyway so he wont make a train ).<br><br>One last thing that sets them apart from normal mobs, the reavers have a pretty hefty chance to spawn another reaver right where they died, immediately when they die. This is a good thing for us, as we don't have to pull. We lose little to no mana with this loop of ours, and are ready to go again almost immediately. If you arent ready to fight again, just get some distance away from the reaver before it dies, and your pet will not aggro the repop.<br><br>These guys drop Jade Reavers for the druid/ranger epic, that sell for about 20-25k. Enjoy screwing those druids back that screwed you on spells.<br><br>ORIGINAL POST BY:  Ickhor Von Memnoch from Brell Serilis Server<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>
