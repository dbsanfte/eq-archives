Currently the only way we can do this is by getting a Amulet of Necropotence, which can't be worn but can be activated, and would better be served by giving to a caster who get's the 14int benefit.<BR><BR>My suggestion is adding the effect of Illusion : Skeleton (or Dry Bones) to the 55 spell Shroud of Death. Makes sense, skeleton form with lifetap proc.<BR><BR>Thanks<BR>--Vrodizh (52 sk on saryrn)</font><BR><BR><font color="#CCCCFF">Good idea! I've updated Shroud of Death on Test Server to grant the caster skeleton form. It makes sense that if you had a Shroud of Death about you, that you would look dead <BR><BR>- Lawrence Poe</font><BR><BR>They also said. . . <BR><BR><font color="#c0c0c0">Arklier wrote:<BR><BR>     I am excited about being able to assume skellie form when I hit 55 with my iksar SK (I'm 48 now) but I wanted to ask if it would be possible for iksars to assume the form of an iksar skellie instead of a normal human(oid) one? I know this is asking a lot, but it would be really cool if the look of the iksar skellie would depend on the sex of the SK, since the iksar skellie mobs are male or female (you can tell by the look of the head). We don't look like other SKs on the inside, and the models are already present in game. Thanks for considering </font><BR><BR><font color="#CCCCFF">This isn't something we can do right now. That model isn't in the 'global' file, so it can't be seen in every zone. There isn't room for us to add it there either. I've had a lot of requests to have iksar necromancers summon iksar skeletal pets too. It's just not possible right now. Sorry.</font><BR><BR>Yeesh all this and more. . .<BR><BR><font color="#c0c0c0">I love the idea.. wud be cool...<BR><BR>As someone who uses the Amulet of Necropotence sometimes, one little word of caution...<BR><BR>Skel form does not allow SLAM to work,<BR><BR>Troll or Ogre SK will lose their Racial Ability to SLAM in this form...<BR><BR>Okay, so just dont use Shroud of Death...<BR>(and miss out on 50pt taps?)<BR><BR>oh wait....<BR><BR>so what Im saying is:<BR><BR>-Please allow Troll Ogre to Slam in this skeletal form, the graphics will leave us as LARGE skeletons.. we shud be able to slam as well....<BR>(unlike when we use the Amulet of Necropotence)<BR><BR>I love the idea of it, the roleplay of it, and the fun of it, but this is really something that should only affect our APPEARANCE, and not our game balance.<BR><BR>Thanks for your time.<BR><BR>-Brik</font><BR><BR><font color="#CCCCFF">We're looking into that. Right now the solution might have to be that we make a new spell that has the skeleton look and leave the old one alone. This would also solve a few of the other concerns that were brought up about the spell.<BR><BR>Thanks for the comment (and to the others that noticed this).<BR><BR>Alan</font><BR><BR><br></p></td><tr><tr><td background="img/purpback.gif"><img src="img/purpback.gif" width=1 height=10></td>
