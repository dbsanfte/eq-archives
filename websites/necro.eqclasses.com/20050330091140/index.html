The message board was hacked this weekend and they spoofed emails to all the registered users of the boards.  The emails didn't originate from any administrator of the site.  It was some childish attempt at being cute.  Apparently any 12 year with google can hack an opensource message board, but obviously they don't have to have an IQ high enough to know how to spell correctly.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I haven't decided if I am going to bring the boards back or not.  I kept them up as a hobby and now it seems they are being targeted nearly monthly for hack attempts and I am growing tired of fixing the site.  We moved to phpbb for speed and since then we have been hacked 4 times by exploits that have no patch released for it.  I might bring the boards back but as it stands I more than likely will not.<br>&nbsp;<br>
I appreciate everyone's time and energy that they have spent at the site and I hope you all understand my position.  I have actually been considering closing the boards down for a while now and the latest hack attempt pretty much sealed it.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you would like to discuss anything please send an email to <a href="mailto:thevisiontm@eqclasses.com">thevisiontm@eqclasses.com</a><br>&nbsp;<br>
Thanks,<br>
