        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">If we are to understand where we fit in for the high level game and whether we can currently perform our duties, we have to understand what a necromancer is in terms of EverQuest.</P><P><b><u>Pets</u></b><BR>First of all, the necromancer is a pet class.  We get a pet at every spell level from level 1-49, then a pet at level 53, 56 and 59.  A necromancer is traditionally a summoner of the dead to do their bidding.  In relation to power of other pet enabled classes in the game, the list should go like this.</P><P>In order from most powerful pets to the least powerful pets (HP/damage output):</P><P>1. Magician<BR>2. Necromancer<BR>3. Shaman<BR>4. Enchanter<BR>5. Shadowknight (lower level versions of ours)<BR>6. Druid (pretty much novelties)</P><P>*NOTE* I am not including the beastlord in this list at the moment.</P><P>Currently, this order is preserved in the game.  However, the balance of relative power between the magician and necromancer is not consistant with the rest of the game in the high level game.</P><P>What is a pet's purpose in the game?  For the sake of ease, I will include only the magician and necromancer in any comparisons.</P><P>1.  <u>Tanking</u> - For a magician, who cannot fear kite using a pet, the role of a pet solo for a magician is to take the hits for the mob.  If the magician is 'agro kiting' this is not the case but this is not the main method of solo that a magician uses.  For this job, their pets do a more than adequate job, having the hit points and taunt factor necessary to keep the mob on them and to keep them alive.</P><P>For a necromancer, whose primarily method of soloing which involves the use of summoned pets (i.e. not charms) is fear kiting; taking hits is a secondary role to create a buffer when fear needs to be reapplied or is resisted.  At level 49 however, we receive a considerably upgraded version of our pet.  With much more damage output and nearly double the hit points of the level 44 pet, we can actually adopt a new method of soloing which involves using our hp pact line of spells and hp over time dots to keep the pet healed during combat.</P><P>All seems well in the 1-49 game in terms of power balance between the magician and necromancer pet tanking abilities.  However, at level 53 we receive our next upgrade to the 49 pet, which is needed considering we are facing many tougher mobs at this level.  However, it was determined at some point that the 50+ necromancer pets would be made situational instead of general, basically meaning that a pet can have increased damage output or hit points, but not both.   Thus, the level 53 rogue pet was given a boost to its attacking power which was in line with the progression of damage output between spell levels earlier when behind the mob.  This was an excellent pet in regards to fear kiting in theory.  However, with the new mobs we are facing, anything we fear kite will be hitting extremely hard and have the ability to riposte in many occasions.  As such, unless the necromancer manages to keep the pet behind the mob (avoiding ripostes) and feared the entire time / agroed between fears meaning no resists and perfectly timed fears (avoiding the pet taking melee damage), the pet will struggle to keep pace with the sheer damage output of monsters and as such, even in many fear kiting situations, not be able to do its job and survive.  Clearly, this pet is not a tank and any situation where tanking is needed, the necromancer falls back to the level 49 pet.  Its abilities in raids where the monsters have AoE damage attacks falls extremely below par too.</P><P>The next pet upgrade we receive is at level 56.  This pet also has considerable less hp than the level 49 pet received 7 levels earlier.  It does have considerable higher attacking power.  However again, the low hit points of this pet make it extremely "situational" in regards to its use.  The 49 pet is used many times over this one as well.</P><P>The level 59 spectre has virtually the same tanking ability as the level 49 pet.  This pet spell is 10 levels higher than the 49 pet, and those 10 levels are considerably tougher than any levels previous.  Its fear immunity and higher level make it slightly better to use but is no where in line with a level 59 magician in terms of relative balance nor is it any sort of upgrade to anything at all.</P><P>Clearly, the way pets are used in the 50+ game deviates greatly from the way they were up to level 49 and do not perform in tanking abilities.  The 49 pet cannot perform this role any longer at this level either.  We are left with ONLY "situational" pets whereas the magician has 4 different types of pets that range from high tanking ability to high damage output.</P><P>2.  <u>Damage Output</u> - Damage output from level 4-49 for the magician and necromancer pets is very much in line with how it is supposed to be.  At level 53, we receive a rogue pet.  As most know, rogues are notorious for their raw melee damage output, especially when positioned behind the mob.  The same holds true for a monk; the level 56 pet is classified as a monk.  The level 59 pet is again a warrior.</P><P>Lets take a look at the maximum damage output of a necromancer pet from level 39-59.</P><P>Level Pet         Max Hit (w/ focus)     Additional Abilities<BR>39                41                     Bash/Kick 20/18<BR>44                49                     Bash/Kick 19, Damage Proc (?)<BR>49                57                     Bash/Kick 25, Damage Proc (?)53                59                     Backstab 165, Damage Proc (?)<BR>56                61                     Flying Kick 73, Damage Proc (?)<BR>59                59                     Bash/Kick 40, Damage Proc (?)</P><P>As you can see, the damage progression from 39 to 49 is pretty consistant.  Then at 53 we receive a pet with less than half the hits points which can hit for two more points of damage and has the potential to do much more when positioned behind a mob.  At 56 we receive a pet that can do an additional 2 points of damage and receives a special higher damage ability as well as higher atk ratings to be able to perform slightly more damage than the 49 and 53 pets in most circumstances of sustained fighting (where it does not die due to its low hit points and the rogue cannot be constantly positioned correctly.)  Finally, at 59 we receive the much awaited spectre pet. This pet hits for LESS than the level 56 pet and has only bash and kick as special attacks.  It is immune to fear type spells.</P><P>As you can see, the damage progression from 49-59 is very much out of line from the previous pets.  If you take a look at how damage progresses for a magician, you will be even more alarmed. It is pretty common for any of their level 49-54 pets to beat a level 59  necromancer pet.  Can a level 24 magician pet beat a level 39 necromancer's pet that easily?  Add in the fact that the pets have considerable less hp than the magician pets and the 49 necromancer pet and you will surely be as disgusted as the majority of high level necromancers are.</P><P>The Fix:  First of all, I believe that the post 50 pets should follow the same method of linear advancement as we previously had.  HP and attack power should both increase as we increase in level and not be a tradeoff as it is currently for us, and generally NOT for a magician.</P><P>As such, our 50+ pets need an upgrade.  Both because of the reasons above regarding relative balance and consistancy with a magician as well as to stay in line with the constant advancement of melee characters with the infiltration of new equipment.</P><P>Proposed Pets (w/ focus):</P><P>Level 49 pet (unchanged) -- Invoke Death<BR>Hit Points: 2350<BR>Max Hit:  57<BR>Additional Abilities:  Bash/Kick 25, Life Drain (40)</P><P>Level 53 pet  -- Minion of Shadows<BR>Hit Points: 2900<BR>Max Hit: 59<BR>Additional Abilities:  Backstab 165, Life Drain (50)</P><P>Level 56 pet -- Servant of Bones<BR>Hit Points:  3400<BR>Max Hit: 61<BR>Additional Abilities:  Flying Kick 73, Life Drain (60)</P><P>Level 59 pet -- Emissary of Thule (spectre)<BR>Hit Points:  3950<BR>Max Hit: 61 <BR>Additional Abilities:  Bash/Stun: 40, Life Drain (80), Spectre Stun (25), Fear Immunity<BR>Additional Costs: Peridot (1); no bone chips (its a spectre!)</P><P>This would still put the magician's pets at the same level at the same distance from us in terms of damage output and hit points and the magician epic pet, with an amazingly high level of hit points, 70 damage hits, extremely high-damage procs, etc. would still give them the far and ahead distinction of being the best pet class as they should be.</P><P>Basically what is being said is that a necromancer should never have to use a level 49 pet at level 53 or 56 or 58.  Each new pet level should make the previous pet virtually obsolete the same way it has been for the entire career of the necromancer and magician.  Situational pets are NOT what we do.  Although you may note that in certain circumstances, the 49 pet would still be used for its bash ability, the 53 pet for its backstab ability, etc.</P><P>Yes, when you look at that list it seems pretty powerful when compared to what we have.  This is probably what Verant saw too.  However, with the addition of the mage epic and how much sheer damage output melees can now do with Velious gear, pets need a rebalancing, even for magicians, and Verant needs to open up its mind.  EverQuest is an evolving world and pets should not remain the same.  With the balance issues presented here that is even more fitting.</P><P>Additional updates for pets in general in this game are needed, but for the sake of clarity they are detailed below.</P><P><b><u>Damage Dealing</u></b><BR>Additionally, a necromancer is a damage dealing class.  In beta, they were classified as being a sort of dark wizard, being able to do large amounts of damage over time.  Damage over Time spells (DOTs) and pets are both tools in this.</P><P>From levels 1-49 the DOTs we received evidence this.  The other dotting classes, shamans and druids, fall in line with the progression of:</P><P>(in order from most to least damage) <BR>1.  Necromancer<BR>2.  Shaman<BR>3.  Druid<BR>4.  Enchanter; Others</P><P>After that, the necromancer is still the king in overall DOT damage when stacking DOTs.  However a notable distinction occurs when the shaman is given the best single dots in the game.  The addition of new DOTs lately (Funeral Pyre) have closed that gap.  I do believe that this is still relatively balanced however, as a shaman usually has other roles.</P><P>Additionally, after stacking dots, lifetaps and our small library of direct damage spells (Shock of Poison, Torbas Acid Blast, Ignite Bones, Incinerate Bones, Insidious Retrogression, Chill Bones, Conglaciation of Bones) can offer up additional, and often significant amounts of damage if more than a few necros are present at a raid.  DOT stacking might be looked into, but generally we have plenty of dots to go around so that many necros distributing which dots to keep on a mob to manage agro and optimize damage in addition to lifetaps/DDs would keep the damage output relatively on par in long fights to a wizard and other classes.  There was a discussion somewhere that compared a necromancer with demi lich chain casting touch of night versus a wizard chain casting dragon bane with C2, DOTs weren't included, and as the fight progressed the necromancer was getting surprisingly close damage amounts due to the mana regeneration factor.  Add in a decent pet and a few dots and you got a balanced damage dealing situation.</P><P>Previously there were major issues with us getting resisted on every single thing we casted, even the supposedly unresistable lifetaps.  Seemingly this has been greatly fixed although some issues still remain with certain Kunark dragons, etc. :)</P><P>I do believe we need a few more stackable dots and perhaps an upgrade to Splurt and Envenomed Bolt at higher levels.  Also, a signature 7200 damage dot over say 6 minutes to put us at the top of damage over time would be a great idea and very good for longer fights.</P><P>Remember, a wizard should do comparable damage in fights lasting more than a couple minutes, with the difference widening in favor of the necro the longer the fight continues, and much more in the wizard's favor in short fights.  Our class is classified as one who does damage over time, so it should perform as such.</P><P><b><u>Mana Regeneration</u></b><BR>The necromancer has also been classified as a lich.  In tradition, one aspect of a lich is someone who takes their life to regain mana points.  This is the objective of our Dark Pact line of spells:</P><P>Dark Pact (8)<BR>Allure of Death (20)<BR>Call of Bones (34)<BR>Lich (49)<BR>Arch Lich (60)<BR>Demi Lich (60)</P><P>They basically apply a dot to us and increase our mana regeneration.  Other forms of mana regeneration in the game are Bard Songs, Enchanter Clarity line of spells and Shaman Cannibalize.</P><P>Bard songs are stackable with everything so I will not include them in comparisons.  Clarity does not stack with the Lich line.  It does stack with a shaman who is cannibalizing.</P><P>Breeze tops Dark Pact in mana regeneration; clarity tops Allure of Death; clarity II tops call of bones.  Lich is unrivaled by any enchanter line of spells.  Arch Lich is the same spell with a different illusion/effect (no UV).  Demi Lich is basically the best form of mana regeneration around.</P><P>Add in the Subversion line of spells.  These spells were added so that a necromancer could give away their mana to someone else.  However, the ratio is very bad.  For example, 400 mana from the necromancer yields around 150 mana for the person receiving it.  Since a necromancer can regenerate mana so fast and doesn't have too much to do during any sort of buffing phase as a cleric, shaman, enchanter, etc. does, it made sense for them to receive this ability.  However, for a very long time, in many encounters, a necromancer was virtually useless as no spells would stick and pets would die to AoEs because they couldn't have a healer on them and a necromancer couldn't heal if their lifetaps wouldn't land.  As such, they were reduced to simply using this spell to fill up cleric's and wizard's mana.  A well played necro nowadays knows when to use this spell and can explain people's misconceptions away about what else a necromancer can do.  I would still have rathered this spell to never have been introduced but it certainly does help during buffing when all we can do is DMF and during major wipeouts when no click stick is available.  It can even have strategic uses on rare occassions.</P><P>--</P><P>Those are the main roles of a necromancer.  A necromancer is never going to be a needed class.  It should be much as wizards are now, wanted for the effect they have on long fights and appreciated for their participation on short ones.  There are some changes that really need to be made to make sure a necromancer fills those roles sufficiently.  Pet changes seems to be something needing the most work.</P><P>Additionally, there are other balance / gameplay issues that need to be addressed and some more improvements to the class or game in general.  Since melees can be upgraded simply by more loot, but a caster's loot upgrades only provide very superficial upgrades to efficiency but not power, these sort of updates are much more needed for casters in general including Necromancers.  Specialized spells dropping off of uber mobs that make a caster better also are a good thing.</P><P><b><u>Other Improvements</u></b><BR><i>General</i></P><P><u>Agression</u> - As stated above, the way 'agro' works in this game has some flaws.  Sitting down creates such a large amount of agro that all the rogues, monks, rangers, warriors, etc. doing crazy damage per second to the mob are all secondary and you get summoned and beat on.  Intelligence on the mobs part needs to be much improved.</P><P><u>Spell Availability</u> - Recently, Verant seems to have some idea that putting utility spells or even spell fixes as rare drops or on rare mobs or on mobs way beyond the level of the spell is a good thing. Sometimes even all of the above.  *cough* Group DMF *cough*  I believe that these spells should be available the same way other spells of that level are obtained.  A few research, vendors, etc.</P><P>The idea of special high power spells (such as new higher damage / ratio dots) dropping off of high level mobs much as much better weapons drop for melee characters is completely different from this and something I support.</P><P><u>Spells Functioning</u> - Apparently the new group tap spells for necromancers are not doing their job and giving their benefits only to the caster instead of the whole group.  There have been many patches so far and many of them have included much more trivial things to the game.  This should be one of their major priorities.</P><P><u>Quivering Veil of Xarn</u> - Either remove the illusion effect or make it remove the illusion much the same way lich does when casting.  It doesn't seem to be the hardest thing in the world to do.</P><P><i>Utility</i></P><P><u>Spell: Dead Man Walking</u> (44) - Currently we have resist cold and resist disease as well as DMF for increasing poison resist.  Cold, disease and poison are all effects related to necromancy so that makes sense.  However, the only form of poison resist we currently get is Dead Man Floating.  Many zones for certain reasons, some of which make sense (Plane of Air) and some of which don't (Kedge Keep) don't allow this type of spell to be cast.  As such, our only form of poison resist is null and void there as well.  This is not a huge deal, but some sort of Dead Man Walking spell or the endure/resist poison line of spells should be given to necromancers.  Also, Dead Man Walking with enduring breath and see invis which stacks with the new druid SoW / Lev spell would be nice.</P><P><u>Levant</u> - I see levant as merely a more focused version of Shadowstep (level 8).  Due to the high level of this spell, 55, the necromancer has learned to channel his energy and shadowstep to a specific place in the zone rather than a random outburst of energy.  Shadowstep did not have a nighttime only restriction and levant should not as well.  This will definately not make Druids and Wizards less useful simply because this is a self only spell.  Levant needs to be usable all day.</P><P><u>Spell:  Engulfing Shadows</u> (59) - Similar to the druid spell which stops rain in a zone, I believe this should let a high level necromancer make it night time in a zone.  This would basically be a novelty item as our night time only spells which remain aren't really useful (other than levant.)  Something I've heard some people talking about and it would be pretty fun.</P><P>Reagent:  Black Pearl</P><P><u>Arch Lich</u> - This spell is the same mana regeneration as the level 49 spell Lich with a different illusion and the removal of Ultravision.  It is a level 60 spell, the same as the much more useful Demi Lich spell.  It has been said that the only use for this spell is to scare newbies in Oasis and the sad thing is that this is true.  As such, Arch Lich is often a spell that is never casted.  I believe Arch Lich should have Ultravision added as well as making the user immune to fear type spells, in much the same way the spectre pet is.  This balances the use of this spell with Demi Lich for certain encounters and would make it very useful in certain situations (we know how much Verant loves situational stuff!)</P><P><u>Spell:  Personal Summon Corpse</u> (51) - If this spell is not currently in game, it should be added.  A necromancer has by this level perfected the art of summoning a corpse and should at least be able to manipulate his own corpse without using an expensive coffin.</P><P><u>Spell: Death Peace</u> (51) - Necromancers were the original class to receive feign death, even before monks.  They receive the skill at level 16, one level before monks.  It fits in very well with the whole notion of death associated with the necromancer.  I see NO reason how this would unbalance anything.  Monks and Shadowknights would still be kings of pulling due to their much better defensive abilities, disciplines, etc.  If there is some reason this would disrupt game play I would like to hear it.</P><P><u>Spell: Impart Death</u> (60) - We should be able to eventually cause the same effect on others as we can on ourselves.  This would be very useful to save someone getting beat on or a cleric who can't camp out.  It would have a pretty long recast delay (~20 minutes) which would make it useful as a last ditch resort (not as some sort of new pulling technique.)  Perhaps this could be an AA skill, much the same way clerics get to bestow divine aura.</P><P><u>Spell Line:  Resist Fear</u> (16-54) - This should increase someone's natural resistance to fear type spells, ending with a 70% fear resistance at level 54.  The spells would have regeants in line with the Rune type spells (cats eye agates to peridots) and have a high mana cost / recast and low duration so a necromancer couldn't make a whole raid resistant to fear, but it would certainly help tanks maintain agro if they weren't running all over the place.</P><P><i>Pets</i></P><P><u>General Pet Changes</u> - See Above</P><P><u>Pet Summon Level</u> - When you currently summon a pet, you have a random chance of getting a low level one to the highest level one regardless of what level you are.  I propse that the minimum summon level of the pet be in relation to your level.  Example:</P><P>Level 49 necromancer casts level 49 pet.  His minimum pet level will be the lowest possible.<BR>Level 53 necromancer casts level 49 pet.  His minimum pet level will be the highest possible.</P><P><u>Pet Buffs / Disciplines</u> - Other problems with all pets in the game in general are things like resists, taunnting, etc.  I propose a line of pet buffs that increase resists, fear resist, attack power (with subsequent decrease in defense), defense power (with subsequent decrease in attack).  Only one spell in addition to your normal pet buff (Augmentation, etc.) could be on the pet at a time.  This would make the pet viable in certain encounters without overpowering them.  Magicians should recieve the same line of buffs but no other pet classes can.</P><P><u>Pet Hold</u> - This should be a basic pet command, no question about it.  It has a few strategic uses but its main use is to counteract bad pathing and pet agro code.  It should definately be available to all necromancers, not just level 59+ ones who have progressed that far in AA skills.</P><P><i>Damage Output (See Above)</i></P><P><u>Spell Line:  Degenerate</u> - There are many mobs with large regeneration rates which indirectly increase their HPs.  I propse a necro only spell line which reduces the regeneration rate of mobs by a certain percentage all the way up to 70%.  This is akin to a shaman slow, which is one spell which can reduce the damage output of a mob very considerably and indirectly be akin to a heal worth tens of thousands of hitpoints to people hit in the encounter.  This spell line would have the potential to indirectly have a necromancer do large amounts of damage over time without increasing their solo power (since most solo mobs don't have regen rates of any magnitude.)</P><P><u>Spell: Decay</u> (55) - Disease based Deflux similar to the disease based Touch of Night at level 60.  Perhaps implement a quest for this spell.</P><P><i>Epic</i></P><P>There has been lots of talk regarding the epic effect on the scythe of the shadowed soul (as well as the look but I won't get into that yet.)  It is a snare + dot that is virtually the same as the level 49 spell Cascading Darkness.  Without doubt, this effect is definately not comparable to some other epics such as the Cleric or Magician one and really needs some changing.  Remember though, when you compare this to the druid epic, which has a longer snare and slightly more damage, keep one thing in mind.  They are mana free and ours has more damage per second.  As such, you can keep reapplying the epic before it even wears off and do more damage with ours than the leafblower.  Take that! :)</P><P>Barring any major changes in the epic effect, meaning it will stay as a darkness type effect, I think the following changes need to be made:</P><P> - Casting time reduced to 4 seconds.<BR> - Switched to disease resist with a slightly lower resist rate.</P><P>Before you start getting mad, just read over that.  A 4 second cast time disease based low resist snare dot equivalent to cascading darkness.  That seems very nice and would be unique for a necro.  Perhaps not as useful as some of the others, but we have other uses.  I would much rather have that than a component free summon corpse or whatnot.</P><P><i>Graphics</i></P><P>Sorry, had to throw this in here.  We really need our pet returned to its previous tough, big, dark self with the glowing ominous eyes.  The new graphics are a joke.</P><P>Same with the epic, it really needs its graphic changed.  I know some like the current look and I think they should have the option to keep it, but with Luclin out and more complex looking weapons, I definately think that the epic needs to either become more detailed so it doesn't look like a duck or to be completely redesigned (preferred imo.)</P><P><b><u>Conclusion</b></u></P><P>All in all, many recent changes have made the game better for necromancers.  Our solo power is still very good in Norrath (with recent changes they have made to Luclin zones, thats a different story) as is our contribution to a group (ever play with a well played necro if you doubt this?).  Our raiding role needs to be looked at as well as some other minor issues and a major one (pets), but it seems that it is getting done.  Perhaps some of these suggestions will make their way into Verant and into the game.</P><P>DISCLAIMER:  Many things in this are my opinion and some numbers / facts may be wrong.  Feel free to correct me or offer your opinion but please don't turn this into a flame fest or another thread full of bitching.  If you think something is wrong, don't just bitch about it.  Offer a reasonable suggestion.  I don't want to see these boards go from a nice source of information for hunting, character advancement, etc. to a place for necromancers to rant and rant endlessly as seems the current pace.</P><P>I would really also like to see more resposnive customer support.  If there is someone in charge of necromancers specifically, let them come to this board and post.  If it is for casters in general or spells or however they have it set up, give them more freedom and abilities to communicate with us and use the ideas of the people who play the class daily.  No matter what they do, they can't know the ins and outs of the effects of what they do if they don't play with it daily.  This will definately improve their business versus other new MMORPGs and prevent people from leaving in frustration even more, so it would benefit Verant greatly.</P><P>Feel free to add your thoughts.</P><P>Daedrea Darksoul</font></td>

Without doubt, this effect is definately not comparable to some other epics such as the Cleric or Magician one and really needs some changing. Remember though, when you compare this to the druid epic, which has a longer snare and slightly more damage, keep one thing in mind. They are mana free and ours has more damage per second.

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">First off, I'm not gonna send this to Verant or anything.  The effort will result in nothing.  The necromancer class is quite possibly the least played class in the high levels (there are usually more 60s of many classes online on my server than level 50-60 necros.)  Even if this is largely their fault, they need to cater to EVERYONE else before they even consider us which is good business practice, and considering how many balance issues the game has we are gonna have a  long wait.  If someone else wants to take that effort be my guest.</P><P>Secondly, Dulanas.  This post was not meant to be a comprehensive list of what needs to be done to fix the necromancer class.  It was an evaluation of what the necromancer is currently in this game versus what it was envisioned/should be.  You'll notice I did not mention that our DoT damage should increase by any great amount.  I just stated that Pets, Damage over Time and Mana Regeneration was our niche.  If we weren't performing those roles effectively, I gave suggestions on what would fix it. There weren't many problems at all with mana regen or damage so those are just summaries of what we can currently do with some minor suggestions. Also, regarding the Other Suggestions (ie Levant).  Those are just that, other suggestions.  Some of them are much more required (fixing stat taps) and some are just things that would add to the class / fun (making it nighttime.)  I didn't mean for this to be a list of what we should present to Verant to fix, but what I think the necromancer class should be and what changes need to be made to its current form to turn it into that.  The other suggestions just helped iron that out.  If we got none of them we'd still be pretty effective with a better pet if our spells weren't resisted.  I certainly wouldn't want Verant working on Engulfing Shadows when our pets (which I stated as our biggest issue) or taps weren't working.  This also wasn't directed at Verant.  I do not believe they read this board anymore first of all considering their silence in even acknowledging the taps were broken.  Secondly, as stated above, we are a minority of players and if they want to make money they please the majority first (Safehouse.)  Thats unfortunate but just the way it is.</P><P>Daedrea Darksoul<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

I only gave my opinion in that your post is in the right direction, just that it's too much at once in the face of verant.</P><P>Our MAIN issues should be addresses first, meaning just show verant those for right now. THEN we can move onto other less important changes.</P><P>I, and many others would agree that SoL taps and our Pet's taps/HP/dmg output both need a boost in power, and these 2 issuse represent the most heated of necro issues.</P><P>It seems that it would get more attention if we listed 1-2 MAIN problems of us to verant....we'd like changing rather than every single thing (10-20) things wrong us.</P><P>It might be viewed as being too analytical. It's a good post, i meant no harm in disagreeing, i just thought it to be too much at once.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

If you even get one or two resists on a mob, its a dead pet. When you are fighting MOBs that dbl attack for 140+ and/or riposte/flurry the 53/56 pets will get shredded.</P><P>Situational pets are fine, I have no problem with that. But I still rarely use the 53 pet because of the HP issue. Its like rogue attacking a mob solo. Sure hes gonna do a lot of damage but when the mob turns on him he isnt gonna last 5secs. </P><P>Im happy with the level of these pets and the procs (when they get fixed), but the 53/56 pets NEED a HP upgrade.

Why Verant decided that at level 53 the pet would only get one new benefit and not both is beyond me.</P><P>Also, in regards to magicians, I was certain someone would post.  As I have stated, I do not wish necromancer pets to have anything like the power of magician pets.  Magician pets need upgrades too.  What I am saying is that after 50, the magician earth pet doesn't get a downgraded hp because of its upgraded damage output.  We shouldn't receive that either.  Our pets have been a certain distance from the magicians from levels 1-49 in regards to hp and damage output and that was perfectly balanced and it should remain that way. If we have a 4000 hp spectre pet, I don't see anything wrong with them having a 59 pet with much more.  Imagine a world where your pets all had their hps halved to below the level 44 pets HPs and their damage output remained what it is currently (since it progressed correctly.)</P><P>I'd venture to guess that the 50+ Kunark pets where as hastily thought out as the other spells (Skin of Shadow?) and would really like to see the errors corrected.</P><P>Daedrea Darksoul<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

They don't want weakness... you just have to live with it.  Almost every class board for everquest has everyone bitching and complaining about everything, YET people still make it to 60 and still have a fun time.</P><P>BTW Mages get a Rogue pet at level 54 too and it can't tank very well either.  It does a lot of damage but has lower HP.  The earth pet has a lot of hp but hits slower and gets hit for the max more.  The air pet that is supposed to be a monk pet has a lot of hp and agi hits for less than the earth(same as water pet but without the backstab) but can riposte and doesn't get hit as much.  It doesn't have a "kick" like the necro monk pet.  The fire pet is an extreme joke it has low hp and nukes for up to 220 I believe the only problem is almost everything resists the nukes.</P><P>So having utility pets at higher levels and longer lasting fear spells makes a difference.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

But i ALSO said that mage's pets need to be increased as well...upping their HP and damage so THEIR PETS STAY BETTER THAN OURS</P><P>You're not telling us anything we don't know. Of course mage pets are supposed to be better....BOTH CLASSES pets need upgrading due to velious and luclin, and high lvl mobs in general. The slope on the power curve does not continue to climb as you move from 49 pet, 53, 56, 59. It goes from a nice steady increase in power, to pretty much just a flat line in power at lvl 60.  The spectre is marginally tougher than the 49 pet.

The disease based deflux will only make us more useful, not more powerful.  Same with the fear resist line, impart death, etc.  I was being reasonable regarding these.  I realize we won't be a required class but we should at least help out when there.  The few things that will make us more powerful (pets basically) are there for a reason, we need our power upgraded in relation to current melee standards.  If you really think any of these suggestions would make us a super class please elaborate.  If I really wanted to be a super class I'd say we should get the best pets, best DoTs and DD spells equivalent to a mage at least. ;)</P><P>*EDIT* If you don't want them to be able to solo easier, make it so that unbuffed pets can withstand normal solo fighting with a small upgrade and give us pet only hp/level buffs (see: beastlord ;)).  They can be high mana and relatively low duration so they will let the pet have lots more HP for big mobs but keep solo power level.</P><P>Daedrea Darksoul</P><P>Edited by - Daedrea Darksoul on 12/13/2001  13:16:04<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

Necros fear kite with pets.  If the damage output stays about the same on pets, it will be just the same except without the headache of our pet dying on us from ripostes or a resist or two.  If we are lucky enough to be killing undead (use the slow), it isn't the easiest solo method in the world either.  Not to mention the very few areas we can do this in the 50s.</P><P>I don't know about magician upgrades and how that would affect their soloing, but really, it shoudln't be a prob and would definately allow us to use those pets if they don't die in one round of AoE or like one riposte in raids.</P><P>Daedrea Darksoul<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Daedrea this is a wonderful essay on the state of the necromancer. I think you are 100% right in what you have proposed and it's a wonderful compilation of just about all of our issues. If only (1) person at Verant cared 10% as much as you do our class would finally be fixed. The necromancer still needs good people like you who care and are passsionate about our class</P><P>Dulanas I find your negative attitude troubling. No matter what kind of suggestions we make you come online and post things like "Verant is too busy fixing bugs.." "The list is too long, they won't read it.."</P><P>Let me tell you something. It is their *job* to read customer feedback. This is what they get *paid* to do. The employees at Verant are intelligent people with college degrees. I resent that everytime someone presents some suggestions for our class you are there like a dirty shirt as an apologist for Verant--you're always making excuses for the shabby way in which they ignore our class concerns.</P><P>Let me remind you and other newbie necromancers that it was over a year ago that Verant initiated their Official Class Balancing talks. I was there. I spent hours and hours contributing posts. They invited input from all players regarding issues players had with their class. Many positive changes were made to many classes with the exception of the necromancer. Then during the spring of this year they let us have "Summon Companion" and gave this previous mage spell to most pet classes. Then a few months ago when they revamped Chardok the put a few spells on high lvl mobs "Dead Men Floating" "Gangrenous Touch of Zum`ul". These spells are incredibly rare and 99% of necros do not even have them. They also started putting low lvl dd illusions spells again on high lvl mobs to replace "Ignite and Chill Bones". Then they made the spectre pet immune to fear.</P><P>Those few changes were all the necromancer class got out of the class balancing talks. The changes are a farce. They have not impacted our classes usefulness on raids in any way shape or form. Yet they made us wait longer than any class. They said they were too busy. Too busy making another expansion. Too busy making more PVP servers. Too busy making another pet class, leaving 2 existing pet classes broken. Too busy nerfing.</P><P>Thank you for having the enthusiasm to still care about our class Daedrea. I barely have the will to log on my necro any more. I feel like a beaten down dog due to the constant nerfs and abuse our class has taken from Verant and our nemesis Abashi who stated last December:</P><P>"Necros should have to pay..."</P><P>Our problem is that we have an individual who is the head of the EverQuest Live team who is an avowed and admitted necro-hater. Abashi has probably put roadblocks in front of every attempt to get our class concerns addressed. Somehow with the resume of a photo-copy repairman he managed to weasle his way into the upper echelons of Verant. </P><P>Daedrae, thank you for carrying the torch and holding it high for the necromancer class. Don't let the board trolls and Verant fanboys get you down. </P><P>I urge you and all necros to take a few minutes and cut & paste your message and send it along to CEO of Verant John Smedley and spell guru Lawrence Poe. Here are their email addresses:</P><P>  John Smedley<BR>  jsmedley@soe.sony.com</P><P>  Lawrence Poe<BR>  lpoe@soe.sony.com</P><P>Dornette<BR>60 necromancer<BR>The Nameless<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
