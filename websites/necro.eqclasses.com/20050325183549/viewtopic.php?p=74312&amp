				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">In the times that went before, her grandmother had been a slave of Innoruuk. Evileene Diablerie, practitioner of the art of necromancy, Ilharess of Qu'ellar V'Umbra, and pawn of the Father. She had died and been reborn in service to Him, fought against those she once considered friends in His Name, and turned her back on her family for His whim. Her first daughter, He took by trickery. Her second, by force. She spent years... decades... a broken woman. But then, when her belly swelled once again with the promise of new life, her spirit was reborn again. Her third daughter, He could not reach. 
<br />

<br />
She knew it was too late for herself, she had been His pawn for too long, His hold on her too great to break free. But for her child, it could be different. She met in secrecy with some of the Others she had had dealings with in the past, with whom she had shared many battles, both triumphs and losses, and for the first time, humbled herself before them, asking their aid. Her determination unwavering, she saw her plan through, feeling the child grow within her, all the while knowing she would have to give it up.  The infant girl, Sorasha, was smuggled from Neriak while most of the world slept, and brought to Freeport, where she was free of Innoruuk and the Spires. Eve never touched her child again, though with magical aid she often watched the girl as she grew. 
<br />

<br />
Those who had taken over the girl's care raised her to be knowledgeable in all things, things that had long been forbidden to the teir'dal, as well as things her race prized. She learned of love and hate at the knees of the priests of Errolisi Marr and Innoruuk. She felt the burning power of fire from the wizards of Solusek Ro, and saw the fury of war from the warriors of Rallos Zek. From the monks, she gained understanding of both the power of fear and the quiet strength of tranquility. Bertoxxulous' Knights taught her of the devastation of disease, and Tunare's druids preached to her of communion with nature. She felt the exhilaration of the thunder across the plains while roaming Norrath with Karana's rangers, and learned the gift of trickery from Bristlebane's rogues. Even the glory of Veeshan was extolled in verse by the bards. And each of these had a part in making her who she was, but she learned to never trust too much in any single god, for they were all powerful and jealous. She learned other things as well, spells of healing and destruction, the art of combat, both ranged and melee. Sorasha fit into none of the molds to which the citizens of Norrath tried to place her, neither wizard nor warrior, priestess nor rogue, she was instead a bit of them all. 
<br />

<br />
When she finally married and had her own daughter, the gods had already abandoned the world, but while many were deep in despair, Sorasha was brimming with happiness. Her husband Rykel was human, handsome and strong, her daughter Gytha a precious mix of both races. In the midst of the Cataclysms, while others prayed for deliverance, Sorasha's family faced the disasters, if not completely unafraid, then at least with a strength of spirit not dependant upon an unseen being, but on their bond with each other. As Norrath broke apart, the three found themselves on a small mass of land, separated by the churning seas from other survivors. Rykel was the first to succumb, his rivvil body already aged by this time, unable to adapt to their new hardships. Sorasha became their sole provider, heading out in the mornings, and returning with meat or vegetables found somewhere on the small piece of rock they were forced to call home. The grieving woman threw herself into the task of educating her daughter, perhaps aware of the sacrifice she herself would soon be called to make.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

The death of her father had rocked her foundations, but both parents had prepared her for that as much as they were able, counselling her on the short human lifespan compared to the elves. What Gytha didn't realize was that food, never plentiful, was finally growing scarce on the island. There was almost no wildlife left, and fruits and vegetables were getting scarce. With no rescue in sight, by the time Rykel had died, Sorasha had been desperate. She never showed her despair to her daughter, simply went out daily to hunt, somehow always managing to bring back hunks of meat for their meals. Her own agonies, she kept in a small journal. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">If I relied on the gods, I would curse them today, as it is, I shall curse the "good" people of Qeynos instead. I have buried my mate before I should, and now I am faced with an awful choice: preserve his dignity in death, or preserve my child's life. That day, nearly a year ago, when the boat stopped here, Rykel and I were filled with hope, with joy... but the Qeynosians were horrified to see a tier'dal among those they planned to rescue. Rykel and Gytha could come with them, they said, but naut me. I begged him to go, or to at least send Gytha with them, but he refused, saying this family would live or die together. He said that he could never leave me behind, and he could not send Gytha to a city where she would be reviled, or taught to hate part of herself. I held hope for a long time, even in my anger, that those sailors would have pity, would send another ship to rescue us, would tell someone we were here, but that hope is gone now. 
<br />

<br />
I took Rykel's body with me today, told my daughter I wished to be alone to lay her father to rest. I took my mother's journal of necromantic magics, and I took my hunting knife. Rykel's wish was for us to live, and his last gift to us will be the ability to do so, at least for a while longer. Gytha will naut know, I will be sure of that. She is still too young to understand that sometimes sacrifices must be made, sometimes survival is more important than anything else. I will naut let this break me. I will look upon this as a last sharing of our love, taking him into me once again, this time to sustain our lives. May his spirit forgive me for what I must do...</span><br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">As Rykel's "gift" ran out slowly, so did Sorasha's patience and her hope. She frequently slipped her meager portions of food onto Gytha's plate when the girl, now a young teenager, wasn't looking. Gytha had now passed her twelfth and thirteenth summer on this rock. It was all for her, and if she didn't survive, all was for naught, the last remnants of the love between Sorasha and Rykel would be gone. Sorasha became gaunt, skeletal...she drove herself and her daughter at an almost hectic pace, teaching the girl spells and magic, drilling her in the combat arts, swearing in frustration at the girl's lack of skill with bladed weapons. It almost seemed to her as if the island they were on was growing smaller, shrinking as the vast expanse of seemingly uncrossable ocean grew ever larger. The plants and grasses here seemed to Sorasha to be withering as she did, dry and useless husks. Just a little longer, she prayed, and drove herself and Gytha harder. Gytha became frightened, the change in her formerly loving mother like night and day, the stories she had heard whispered of dark elves finally making sense. She pushed herself hard as well, trying to please, trying to find the woman who had raised her and kissed her skinned knees in the crazed drillmaster before her. Her skill with staves and maces became excellent, her grasp on spells strong, and with the new knowledge these spells were imparting, she finally saw the desperation beneath the surface of her mother's anger. Sorasha wasn't cruel... she was sick, dying, and scared. The girl finally collapsed one day, sobbing. "You can't leave me here, mother! Rest please... I can naut be alone here!" 
<br />

<br />
"Yrine'winith! Z'lonzic!" her mother spat. Stop! Enough! "You are my daughter, you are part tier'dal at least. Your father was a rivvil, and the strongest man I knew... he gave his life for us! You are naut weak, naut rath'arg--naut coward!" She finally relented, opening her arms to the girl, who fell into them, sobbing. Her voice grew quiet, soothing, her hands running over Gytha's hair and back, comforting and caressing. "There is much you do naut understand, lotha uss, farjali. There is much I do naut have the time to teach you. But you must live, Gytha, you must live! I will make you as strong as I can, but I am weak. Soon, you must take what strength you can from my body, it will be my final gift to you. You must live Gytha. You must do whatever is necessary to survive. No matter what. Promise me that!" 
<br />

<br />
The girl's sobs slowed to occassional hiccups, her tears fading to a slight trickle of salt on each cheek, cradled once again close in her mother's arms. "I promise, Ilhar. I will live... for you and for Papa. Rest now, please, and I will study. I will work hard, and I will make you proud." She kissed her mother's forehead, watching the woman drift off, a peaceful expression finally relaxing her beautiful face. She looked back at her mother once more, with eyes that suddenly seemed far too old for her child's body. Somewhere deep inside, she knew Sorasha wouldn't be waking up. Her grieving could be done later, for now she had a promise to keep.
<br />

<br />
It didn't take all that long to hike from one end of the rock they were stranded on to the other, Gytha used the time to try to memorize the area, seeing it for the first time from a new perspective: as a matter of survival. Instincts the girl didn't realize she had began to surface, guiding her to plants that could be used, to old animal dens that might still house some edible creatures, to fallen logs that could be harvested for wood and fuel. She took careful note of things that could be made into weapons and used for tools. When she reached a small crag in the rock, too small to be called a cave really, something made her pause and look inside. What she saw sent her reeling back, gasping for air, then falling to her knees as she emptied the contents of her stomach on the ground.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Runes that she didn't recognize were marked on the entrance and the floor in a dark reddish brown substance--blood, she recognized in one corner of her horrified mind. A blood-stained knife lay on the stone near the opening. There was a small stack of books in one corner, bound in a leathery substance she didn't want to try to identify. If looked like what she might imagine a hidden area for ritual sacrifice would look like, with one hideous exception: the corpse lying in the midst of all of this was her father. Only his face was recognizable, the rest of his flesh cut away piece by piece, his corpse somehow perfectly preserved, the serene look on his face, his eyes staring unseeingly out at her only adding to her horror. "Oh, Papa...Papa.." She started sobbing, her hand shaking and reaching out to touch the grotesque remains, her fingers brushing over his cold cheek. 
<br />

<br />
She fell backwards, out of the crevice, not even standing up, just scrambling backwards on all fours, hysterical sobs wracking her body. "How could she? How could she?"
<br />

<br />
As the girl sat sobbing and screaming, from somewhere in side came a voice, delivering a mental smack. Her hysterics ended as quickly as they had begun. <span style="font-style: italic">"What does it matter, wael? He was dead already."</span> 
<br />

<br />
She was shaken enough to not find it odd that she was hearing voices, and so automatically answered it. "He was my Papa.. look at him!"
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">"He was wormfood. Dead. Gone. Would it be better that he had decayed and both you and your mother had died?"</span> She flinched.
<br />

<br />
"My mother is dead, I can feel it. So it meant nothing. I am alone now, and I will starve."
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">"You made a promise, child. Did it mean that little? Your mother found a way to survive when others would have given up. Don't you owe it to her?"</span>
<br />

<br />
"What do I do? His flesh is all but gone, anyway."
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">"Your mother's is not."</span>
<br />

<br />
Hysterics threatened once again, everything inside of her cringing at the thought of her mother like this, cold, cut to pieces, bit by bit, nothing more than a means of sustinance. "I can't do it, I don't know the magicks she used, the corpse will rot in a matter of days."
<br />

<br />
A faint light began to glow from inside the crevice where her father lay. She approached it almost against her will, but unable to stop herself. Several journals lay there, bound in some type of leather she didn't recognize. <span style="font-style: italic">"Read." </span><br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">The first journal she picked up was the smallest, and most innocuous. It was obvious this wasn't bound in the same material that the others were, just an ordinary diary, and when she opened it the writing was all too familar. She traced the letters for a moment, her mind returning to the mother she knew was gone. As she read of her mother's upbringing, of the Cataclysms, and then of Sorasha's agonizing over what had happened on this isle, Gytha felt an unfamiliar emotion take hold in her chest. The more she read, the more it grew, until she finally recognized it for what it was... Hate. Hate of what her mother and father had endured, hate for those who had been willing to leave her mother to die simply because of her race, and hate for the choices her mother had been forced to make. The diary ended far too early, with many pages left blank--a reminder of what the "good" people of Qeynos had cost her, Gytha thought bitterly.
<br />

<br />
She picked up the next journal gingerly, finally recognizing the leather for what it was... some kind of flesh. On one journal, a hint of facial features was still visible. She closed her eyes for a moment, then opened the book, allowing her new-found hate to shield her from the sympathy she might once have felt for whatever poor soul had given his life for this book. The handwriting inside was angular and neat, unfamiliar, and the ink was a deep brownish rust color. Blood, she realized. These books were penned in blood.
<br />

<br />
Once she began reading, she silently thanked Sorasha for insisting she learn both common teir'dal and the dialect of the nobles, for this person had switched freely between the two of them in her writings. Gytha tore one of the blank pages from Sorasha's diary, ripping it into shreds to hold pages as she read, marking spells and rituals that she might have need of. All too soon she was lost in the story before her, time passing without her notice, the strange light in the crevice never dimming or fading.
<br />

<br />
The author wrote of a Neriak she would never get to see, a city of pride and majesty, pomp and circumstance, with bustling streets and crowded markets. She wrote of the Church and of the Faithful, of heretics and the Spurned and the Others. She wrote of the great qu'ellaren and minor ellaren that had composed the population of the city, of the rise and fall of names Gytha had never heard of before, and some few she did recognize. She wrote of being a necromancer in the time before the Shattering, of meeting Innoruuk Himself, of fighting against Him, and of finally returning to the Faith. There were pages and pages about what it had been like to band with others of all races to breech the Plane of Time and to defeat the Gods in their home, and finally, at the end, the awareness of what their victory had truly cost the world.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">My child,
<br />

<br />
Neriak is crumbling now. The walls and stone may still be strong, but what held us together is gone. Those who inhabit this city refuse to see, going about blissfully unaware, caring only for what riches they can acquire; the Will is forgotten, and so is the Father.
<br />

<br />
Prophecies have been made about the Fall, about great cataclysms destroying this shell that remains of our once great city, but they land on deaf ears. But naut mine, ussta belearn, ussta xukuth. I know they are true, and so I am sending you somewhere you will be safe. I can naut leave, I have lived too long of a life and my destiny is tied in with this City and with the Father now, but you have a chance, and I will give it to you by setting you free.
<br />

<br />
There are those I have met in my travels who will see you are safe, and to shield you from the jealous Spires who insist I am naught but a crazy old jalil, I will never contact you, but I will be watching over you, Sorasha, in life and in death. Live well, and may the Gods watch over you...
<br />

<br />
Dossta Ilhar,
<br />

Evileene Diablerie</span>

Gytha stood up slowly on legs that had been curled under her for far too long as she read, picking up the journals and stumbling back to the campsite. She blinked a few times, trying to take everything in, before she set her mind to the tasks she had ahead of her. Understanding could come later, survival was her concern for the time being.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">The spells in the journals seemed cumbersome and unfamiliar, but Gytha had the benefit of desperation. She had pulled Sorasha's corpse to an out of the way alcove not far from where their camp had been, stripping her and cleaning the corpse, her hands moving gently over her mother's skin. She bent to kiss her one last time, tears on her cheeks, a farewell both to her mother and to the child she had been.
<br />

<br />
The voice hadn't returned, but somehow she still felt its presence. Male or female, she couldn't tell, but it was there and it was giving her strength silently. She began to chant the first spell softly at first, then with growing volume as she felt a spark of power at her fingertips. Sorasha's corpse began to glow and Gytha switched to the next spell that she had marked, nearly shouting as the unfamiliar magic coursed through her. By the time the corpse was prepared the girl was hoarse, her body trembling in exhaustion.
<br />

<br />
She leaned forward, smoothing her mother's hair back from her face, and whispered softly. "Ilhar, bel'la dos for your gift. You sustained me with your body and held me in your flesh until I was born, and now you shall sustain your daughter again." She slowly sunk the dagger into her mother's flesh, cutting out a small piece. Cradling it in her arms, she walked to the cooking fire, the voice whispering how well she had done and what a brave jalil she was... 
<br />

<br />
The voice was her constant companion, supporting her when she excelled, prodding her when she faltered. Her distaste for how she had to survive soon faded, and she began to see her meals as almost a communion with her mother.. she had been created by Rykal and Sorasha, and now, in their deaths, she had taken them back into herself. In this way she could almost pretend to have not lost them.
<br />

<br />
She pored over the journals daily, learning them, memorizing them, her Hate growing quickly, but she somehow was able to keep some of the childish wonder her parents had fought to preserve in her, even in the midst of her solitude. As the seasons changed, though little in the temperature of the rock seemed to change, various plants and flowers began to grow, and Gytha decorated the campsite with them, even placing a crown of wildflowers on her mother's still perfectly preserved face. To anyone else the sight of the beautiful face with its floral crown contrasted with the body below it would have been a nightmare... to Gytha, it was a thing of beauty. Her mother's flesh was nearly gone now, and she had learned to eat very sparingly, praying to Innoruuk for rescue. By now, she realized she had only a few weeks left.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Pricking her finger with her dagger and catching the blood, she began to write in her mother's journal using a quill and her own blood, saving her story in case the worst happened. She had promised Sorasha she would live, as a legacy of Rykel and Sorasha's love. If she could not, at least their legacy might be discovered one day in her words.
<br />

<br />
She had been writing daily for almost two weeks when the voice spoke to her sharply for the first time in so long. <span style="font-style: italic">"Put up that quill and keep watch!"</span>
<br />

<br />
Gytha sighed softly, her young eyes suddenly looking far too old. "What is the use? Nau one will come."
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">"Enough! Put up your quill and keep watch!"</span>
<br />

<br />
She got up, grumbling, but listened to the voice, walking towards a vantage point near the camp. She scanned the horizon and was about to turn back when she saw a speck in the distant water. A ship? Could it finally be? She spun around, running to light a torch from her campfire. Perhaps, after all this time, Innoruuk had answered her.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">The ship luckily picked her and her few belongings up without question, and without exploring the island. As the place she had lived for almost four years vanished in the distance, the depth of her loss and what she had done to survive hit her, the girl crumpling at the rail of the ship, silent sobs shaking her whole body. The voice was gone as well, and she was alone.
<br />

<br />
She arrived at their destination shell-shocked and numb. What little time she had had to try to sleep had been rocked by nightmares...
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Her parents asking her what she had done, their perfect faces a livid contrast to the gory skeletons below. Blood-stained skeletal fingers reaching out to touch her, tears of blood running down her mother's face as they whispered, "How could you do this to us? We loved you.."</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">The Voice returning, laughing at her. "Look at how weak and pathetic you are. Your parents would be ashamed to see how little their sacrifice paid off... they should have let you die on the island.."</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">A crowd jeering at her, taunting her with what she had done, words like "cannibal" and "murderer" tossed at her, everyone surrounding her with a fork and a knife in hand, poking and cutting at her flesh...</span>
<br />

<br />
She stopped sleeping, afraid of dreaming... waiting until exhaustion claimed her and she drifted off to dreamless sleep. 
<br />

<br />
When she had turned off her dreams, the Voice had left as well, but Gytha could not let herself regret it. Silence was a small price to pay for her sanity, part of her starting to wish she had simply died on the rock with her parents, but a core of strength she hadn't known she possessed forced her to keep on, going through the motions day by day.
<br />

<br />
She relearned how to deal with people on the Isle they brought her to, honing some of her skills, learning new ones, finding that it indeed was the healing arts she was strongest in. She made herself useful, doing any task she could for her rescuers, they in turn rewarding her with armor and a weapon that were far more effective than what she had arrived in. Her choice of a city was not in question. She would be heading to Freeport, the city of her parents, not to the city that preached of love but had let her family die because of the color of her mother's skin. Perhaps in Freeport she could find those who would understand all of what was in her grandmother's journals, perhaps there she would find the remnants of Innoruuk's Faithful. Her life began to center around that, around the chance of reconnecting with the faith and the God that had saved her life on the island. For whether the Voice had been Innoruuk or a spirit or her own imagination, what had been in those journals had been His Will. He had saved her, so she must live and find the Purpose for which she had been spared.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Wandering deeper into Longshadow Alley, Gytha flinched inwardly at the jeers and gestures of the teir'dal she passed.  They apparently hated half-breeds even more than they hated most of the Others, perhaps because they were living proof that the blood of the "perfect" race had been tainted.  She had aged years in the few months she had been in Freeport.  What little of her childhood had remained after the nightmare on the small isle she had been marooned on had been stamped out of her here, in her new "home."  Hatred at every turn.  Hate had been an abstract notion to her, she had certainly not imagined being on the receiving end of it from the very people she had hoped to help and serve.  The same will that had allowed her to survive on the isle served her well here, however.  She had advanced in her training quickly, earning the title of Inquisitor, which of necessity demanded some respect in this place.  She now worked closely with the Temple of War, prized for her determination and her zeal.  Even the trials she had been forced to endure to become first a cleric, then an Inquisitor hadn't dampened her fervor.
<br />

<br />
She heard a raised voice up ahead, and murmuring of a crowd, and headed that way out of curiousity.  A teir'dal woman stood there, her armor battle-scarred, those around her hardly daring to speak above a whisper when they spoke at all.  As she concentrated on the woman's speech, Gytha froze in shock.  The Epistles, the Firstborn!  This woman was a True Believer.  She was one of the Faithful.  Worried at the reception a half breed might get at this sermon, she kept to the back of the crowd, against one of the Alley's dingy walls.
<br />

<br />
The priestess was stunning, as teir'dal often were, but her face held the mark of anger, of bitterness, in a perpetual scowl.  Her eyes were amazing, they almost glowed with holy zeal.  When her voice lowered, the area became totally silent, so as not to miss a word; when it raised, you could almost feel the energy singing through the air.  She preached of Innoruuk, of His return.  She preached of the Old Ways, the traditions and the Commandments.  The Will.  Purpose.  Truth.  Gytha was transfixed, unable to move.  Her deepest desires unfolding before her, spoken aloud by this Priestess.
<br />

<br />
This then, was who she must talk to.  Innoruruk willing, perhaps this time she would find someone willing to listen.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=738273" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v701/evileene/evilsig2.jpg" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
