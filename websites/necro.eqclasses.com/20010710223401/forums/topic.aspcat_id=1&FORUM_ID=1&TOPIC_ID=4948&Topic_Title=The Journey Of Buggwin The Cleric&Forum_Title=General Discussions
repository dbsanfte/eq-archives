(roughly)</P><P>/played is roughly 9 hours 45 minutes</P><P>Day 3</P><P>Nro (again)</P><P>Get into a few groups quite easily, and kill dervs to 12. (Getting tired of frantically<BR>chaincasting light heal and getting really tired of looking at spellbook while medding)</P><P>I muse to my wife that I can probably sit in an easy chair and jump up when somebody needs healing if i watch the bars while watching tv.</P><P>She looks up from her book and gives me a look like I'm an idiot.</P><P>So reluctantly, I go on over and top everyones health. We have a bard in the group constantly playing Hymn of Restoration, so my life is easy for the moment until the damn monk gets in tight fighting. I am always healing the monk it seems. </P><P>Oh and when i heal sometimes all the mobs drop what they are doing and run straight for me, even coming out a mez, they just ignore the fact they are supposed to be mad at the enchanter and come beat on me.</P><P>Of course this being Nro and everyone being somebody else's twink or an utter newbie adds for confusion.</P><P>We're beating on ghouls and I say OOM and the bard in the group says "I could use a heal" as his life bar drops dangerously low.</P><P>So i say OOM again, and then he dies.</P><P>Now I feel guilty, but hey I'm oom.</P><P>So the bard comes back and says "Why didn't you throw me a heal??"</P><P>And I say I was OOM!</P><P>So then he asks what is OOM?</P><P>So, we explain to him the meaning of OOM.</P><P>No the bard decides to pull ghouls. He gets ghoul rooted and everyone is attacking a different ghoul and the enchanter is chain mezzing them because mez keeps getting broken.</P><P>So now, the enchanter and I (he's a necro reborn too it turns out) educate the group on what /assist is.</P><P>So now I'm getting tired and really, I just want things to go smoothly so I don't get interrupted from my staring at the yellow exp bar creeping.</P><P>So now we have it down pat, the enchanter is calling his mezzes with force over the group line and I'm healing and a topping up, i'm hitting divine aura when mobs get too ticked at me. </P><P>(A guildmate told me I was healing too soon, so that helped)</P><P>Anyways, this is fairly painful to me and I  decide to camp as it's just been so much fun being a cleric looking at a spellbook for 4 hours.</P><P>Of course now the group I am leaving is screwed until they get another healer.</P><P>But, it felt good in a way, logging out knowing that yes, they definately are gonna feel the pain when they have no healer.</P><P>My cleric is 2 bubbles into 12</P><P>/played time is 18 hours.</P><P>I find myself looking for more quests for exp when I'm not logged in and I'm half tempted to go investigate that shark meat quest that everyone is raving about.</P><P>(I heard they despawned the NPC that gives out the quest so I just may group instead.)</P><P>But, overall a cleric is a far cry from a necro so far. It's hard to fanthom that such a fun class at post 50 levels becomes so damn<BR>unwelcome in groups at higher levels.</P><P>It just doesn't make sense, and it annoys and frustrates me that I've resorted to playing this cleric so that "I have a place in EQ."</P><P>The cleric is needed and god love anyone who can make it to 50 as one, but it's a chore, it really is.</P><P>------------------------------------------</P><P>I may add more to this, but I think I'll wait until I see some of your responses.</P><P></P><P><BR> </font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Yeah, I've never played a newb cleric before, but I got the chance to be a 54 cleric in the main group on a sky raid my guild did. (of course I was playing the cleric because my necro wasn't considered useful)</P><P>To say the least it was an interesting experience. The first mob we fought against when I logged the cleric on was on Spiroc Isle. We were just clearing it and the first thing I did after buffing my whole party up (my party consisted of 2 lvl 60 war with epics, a lvl 60 rogue with epic, lvl 57 pally with epic, a 56 war, and me...) was try to heal my party members... due to not understanding the aggro of the cleric I got summoned and killed right away hehe.</P><P>Either way after a little practicing, and having divine aura and divine barrier memmed I quickly started to pick it up.<BR>I managed to never lose a party member after that (except to Spiroc Lord death touches) and I rarely got aggro I wasn't ready to handle.</P><P>What I found though is the high lvl cleric game... despite definitely not being for me and kind of boring, isn't actually too far of a cry from the high lvl game of a necro. In fact I would have to say a high lvl cleric in the main pull/assist group has more fun on raids then we do as necros.</P><P>The reason I say that playing the two classes isn't too different at the high lvls is because we both become support classes.</P><P>No longer are necros offensive (imo) but are there to feed clerics, and if you're anything like me, even use our heals (pact series) on tanks just so we can have a bit of fun and risk with balancing our heals and our taps, to stay alive (has anybody else done this, or just me?)</P><P>So to me the biggest difference is the fact that, clerics start the game and play the game knowing they are a support class. During the fight other then to quickly check the mobs life, they have spells flying at various tanks, while trying to control aggro etc etc but are never offensive and are used to it. They don't <i>expect</i> anything different.</P><P>Necros on the other hand were originally built to be an amazingly offensive class! In fact we are so offensive, and so self reliant, we have the ability to walk through the first 50 lvls of the game by ourselves if we want while <i>laughing</i> all the way!</P><P>After playing the cleric, I returned to my necro, with a different point of view. I agree that it is sad that necros are resorting to playing cleric/chanter/warrior to feel like they have a place in the high lvl game we've become accustomed too.</P><P>And I know it is not just an affliction of the Necro class, I know mages at least have alot of the same issues. Sure a mage with their Epic pet is uber, but for a large part mages are stuck in the gimp group, and aren't really the most sought after class in groups. People use them mostly for their CoH abilities (which I equate to our summon corpse abilities). All I can say is at least they weren't given a spell in which they spend their time targeted on a cleric waiting for that nightmare inducing --Cleric tells you "Pump plz!--</P><P>Anyways I ramble (it's late) but in conclusion after learning how to be an offensive class, learning how to deal with tough situations (soloing high cons, or exp in dungeons by yourself), to do nothing on a raid but be a Twitchbitch is kinda sad.</P><P>But to be honest I have hope for our class, I honestly believe that Necros will be changed before SoL and who knows it might even make us wanted once again...</P><P>And I definitely think you should post some more of your experiences with a newb cleric as opposted to a necro, it's an interesting contrast =)</P><P>On a quick side note, my guild did PoG today and I have to admit the 2 other necros in my guild and myself had a blast against Treah and Rumbleroot. We tapped, we dotted, we had our pets flying. It is nice to see some mobs like this in the game, where despite not being "needed" we can at least have a bit of fun being the offensive class we like being.</P><P>Gylgesh Gloomtouch,<BR>54th Necro of the Heroic Few<BR>Morell-Thule</P><P>Edited by - Gylgesh on 05/21/2001  03:16:52<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

I get the odd powerlevel from friends feeling sorry for me but still it's just not speeding up this process.</P><P>I know some of you may frown on powerlevelling, but I look at it as my way of getting where I want to be in the game.<BR>I made a mistake with Buggwin and I'm not paying for it in vast amounts of time levelling up a class that Verant has made more useful than my necro.</P><P>Anyways, yes the cleric is still boring and it's only worsened by the fact that I am used to going Afk with Buggwin.</P><P>Because I'm the cleric I can't leave the keys for fear somebody croaks.</P><P>It's a pain in the ass having to restart all over again and now I have this part of me saying : "Let it go"</P><P>And I can see why. Why should I be forced<BR>to replay 49 levels because I picked Necro as my class?  It's not fair and it's not right. </P><P>To be further denied class upgrades as a necro because of some "bug" in lich is idiotic. They designed the class not me and they brought the bug onto live servers.</P><P>This is not a mud that's free to play. I pay ten dollars a month not to land anything on boss mobs and have my lifetaps resisted.</P><P>I also have a few words for you people who come on here and tell necros who are down on the class to lighten up, or suck it down.</P><P>I poured my heart out into my necro, I was proud of him. He was FUN.</P><P>Now I get close to the real cool stuff like raids on Kael and Dragons Neckropolis, helping my guildmates obtain epics and I get the new role of Mana Bitch.</P><P>So to you, I have but one thing to say, if you honestly think that this is RIGHT or is deemed as OUR ROLE as a Necro, I would like<BR>to say YOU ARE DELUDED.</P><P>NEVER have I heard "we don't have enough necros we can't do this raid."</P><P><BR>You are brought on raids because it's nice to have a mana pump. That's it.</P><P>If they want pet damage a magician will do.<BR>None of your dots will "usually" land.</P><P>A melee will 99.9 percent of the time outdamage you, and I challenge any of you who disagree to go get yourself a log parser and parse out a rogue or warrior's damage.<BR>(And I don't mean the mobs in lake of ill omen either.)</P><P>I mean a bona fide tough mob like the dragon in Timourous Deep or any other tough mob in the same category.</P><P>I apologize that this has turned into a rant, but really, I shouldn't have to be making a cleric so I can experience the game at high ends as a useful and viable class.</P><P>This "you are negative" nonsense I see from the random dupe is not representative of what I have experienced as a necro vs high level mobs.  </P><P>I don't like being told how to play any class and I particularly don't like being told my role in this raid is to pump the clerics.  Even if they DID fix necros, we would have to fight to not pump mana anymore.</P><P>I also don't like that we as a group cannot go to Vetrant on their boards as a majority<BR>to express our displeasure.</P><P>I find their one way message board system a joke and to their advantage. They no longer have to answer ANY issue which they can't or won't address. </P><P>I have mailed these clowns, I have posted to their message board about coffin availability in necromancer starting cities <BR>and yet this issue is NOT addressed. But goddamn if somebody gets exp from a lousy sharkmeat quest, they get right on it and fix it.</P><P>More and more as I watch that idiotic exp bar<BR>creep along the more I realize that I've been duped. This is guaranteed to suck another 4 months getting my cleric to<BR>where my friends are.</P><P>I will get this POS cleric to 50+, and I will do it in the least amount of /played time humanly possible.</P><P>That is my pledge. And you goddamn better not piss me off or you make my "Do not rez list"</P><P>I also further pledge to ruin the economy by flooding cheap good gear into the market with Necro farmed items so that anybody pissed off with Verant's system can get retooled with Yaks for 100 plat each or Charred Guardian Shields for 200 Plat.</P><P>/Rant Off</P><P><BR>Sorry if this post seemed harsh, and really none of you are to blame, but I just can't get over that I have to level another character to be of contribution to groups and friends. </P><P>Let's face it, the minute my cleric hits 49, do you really think they are gonna let me play my necro? And that's the question you as a necro have to answer. Until you say can with certainty say "Yes, my necro is more valuable than the holy trinity." you are wasting your time.</P><P><BR> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">I didn't have you guys confused, I just should have addressed Kaasher in the second paragraph.  I am to understand that you deleted your Necro?  Another thing is that Necros are not useless in MOST settings of the game.  Outdoor small group we are the Enchanter, Cleric, and Tank.  I got a tell today from my Mage friend who said "No we haven't been getting good exp in skyfire today because we couldn't find a necro to join the group".  We also do as well as all the other classes on plane raids (except for clerics).  Exp groups we more than pull our weight.  And dragon raids will always have at least 1 necro there for corpse retrieval and DMF.</P><P>If you are saying that VI made you restart and sacrafice your time then you made a foolish decision, because I remember rogues being that laughed at piece of shit class only what 7 months ago?  If they changed Necros next pathc you would feel awful if you deleted.  Also nice to have your necro to farm/multi quest.</P><P>In conclusion, necros arnt as bad as you feel they are, and if you arn't having fun take a break or quit.  I do not mean stop bringing up the issues, I mean just don't actually log in and play all day if it isn't brining you enjoyment.</P><P>Continue to post the life of your cleric, I find those stories enjoyable :-).</P><P></P><P><BR>[56 Defiler] Zenias (Dark Elf) <Paradigm Nocturne> ZONE: Tholuxe Paells<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
