Hi, I am new to EQ. I will be making my first character when my game arrives in the mail in a day or two. I have been researching everything I can about creating a necro. I was leaning towards a gnome but I keep reading gnomes are not too good as Necro's. I know the best one is the one you have fun playing but since I have not played I am trying to avoid regretting choosing a less desirable race and other stats at the creation. Any help anyone wants to give me is gratly appreciated. Thanks Ophidian

Being KoS is NOT for newbs.  If you are an experienced gamer, you might want to try a necro.  We are one of the most interesting classes in EQ.  </P><P>As to race: Iksar are ok for starting out, but unless you want to level up in Kunark the whole time, the KoS factor is HUGE for a newb in the old world.  Gnome would actually be a good choice.  They have some night vision, tolerated in their home city (and most other cities), Ak'anon takes a small while to get used to, but its not as bad as the other Necro locations (except maybe Freeport and Paineel).  </P><P>The nightvision thing should not be overlooked by a true newb.

I have read and reread all your replies. Thank you.<BR> <BR>A little more info.......first I just read somewhere that..."If you are going for pure gameplay advantage, Iksar is probably the way to go".....  Truly, gameplay is what I am interested in. I don't care about looks or fashion. Just want to have an excellent solid character after I put in all the time. So now am trying to decide between the Gnome and the Iksar. I played Asherons Call for 2 years, extremely easy to gimp a character badley at creation in AC if ya don't know what yer doing or don't have any help. All this worry must stem from there LOL.</P><P>Also I think it is a great idea to play a Warrior for a while to learn a little of the game before I tackle a Necromancer. But I know I will make the Necro character soon as the game is loaded (heh heh) then let it sit while I play Warrior to learn. After reading/researching for almost a week now I KNOW that Necromancer is for me. </P><P>Still have lots of questions like.....What religion should I choose? Not sure what religion in EQ even is? And would the religion choice be the same for both Iksar and Gnome?</P><P>Thanks again guys yer great!</P><P> </font></td>

The reasons I went with a gnome are many...and a few people might not agree with some of them, but here goes.</P><P>Gnomes hide well.  This may not be important on a blue (non-pvp) server, but it is nice.  Faction...I do not have problems in most places.  As a necro, you are going to be KOS in some places...that is part of being a necro.  Gnomes have nice dex and agi, thus my melee skills went up nicely.  If you think that is not important...wait until you are 45th lvl and see how hard a mob hits you when your defense is not maxed out (they still hit hard, but I can tank for short durations.)</P><P>Iksars do have regen...but being the most hated race/class combo in the entire game can be quite annoying at times.  I feel it is much more enjoyable to have a race/class combo that can visit other cities, use other merchants, etc.  As a lizzy necro, everyone will want to pound your head in that is not a lizzy too...there are some exceptions.  I would not go with a lizzy as a newb...or ever, but that is just my opinion.</P><P>Only Erudites have enough of an intelligence boost to mention.  The int difference between Dark Elves and Gnomes is 1 point (134 vs 133.)  So, I do not see how people can claim that dark elves have better starting stats.</P><P>Both dark elves and gnomes can see in the dark; dark elves get hide which is nice...but they need it since they are so hated.  I have never regretted not having hide, and there are some nice items in game that give insta-invis anyway which is much more reliable than hide.</P><P>Dark Elves are liked in their home cities, but Gnomes are not.  That does not matter much since the people you need to like you are your guild leaders and spell vendors...who really cares if you are loved by the rest of your city.</P><P>And last, but not least...dark elf necromancers are a dime a dozen.  There are a decent amount of gnome necros, but not nearly as many as as there are dark elves.  If you see a dark elf, half the time you are looking at a necro.</P><P>One more thing...the int difference between erudites (high is 142) and gnomes (high is 133) is not so much that a few pieces of gear can not make up the difference later in the game when more int acutally influences your amount of mana.</P><P>The int/mana thing works like this:</P><P>@lvl50 1int = 10mana<BR>@lvl45 1int = 9mana<BR>@lvl40 1int = 8mana<BR>35 = 7mana<BR>30 = 6mana<BR>25 = 5mana<BR>20 = 4mana<BR>15 = 3mana<BR>10 = 2mana<BR>5 = 1mana</P><P>So, int does equal more mana...later.  Early on you wont see much of a difference between an int of 142 and 133.  At lvl 40 9int is a 72 mana difference.  That can be a lot or a little depending on how well you plan your encounters.  My gnome has always had enough mana since I plan carefully.</P><P>At level 60, the regen of an iksar might be very nice...but with the exp penalty (I hate exping, I like to play) leveling will be a bit slower...but you are still hated by the entire world.</P><P>Gnomes will rule the world.</P><P>The best thing to do when trying to trouble shoot pc issues is to try and remember the last thing you did before it started acting strangely, then empty a clip from a .45 cal pistol into the case...followed by tequilla shots.</font></td>

There's an awful lot of learning curve to overcome and I figured an "easy" character would get me up to speed in the least amount of time. This worked out really well for me, but some people will have no problem starting with harder classes, so do what's best for you.</P><P>I picked Gnome to be different - there aren't very many gnome necros on Vazaelle. I figured stats differences could be fixed with gear - at level 31 I've got 173 INT so I think I'm doing pretty well. The Iksar regen factor was appealing but, in the end, I decided it wasn't worth the 20% exp penalty and extra KOS hassles. (This was back when pets would take exp.)

And I must say that I started her for the same reason that Smyrt did.  There aren't many gnomes that wander the lands of Norath, let alone gnomish necromancers.</P><P>As for my reasoning in not chosing the other classes...  Well, everyone and their mom has a DE necro.  And I really hate having severe KOS issues.  (I deal with that enough for my poor Iksar monk)  I had actually debated on weither or not to choose Erudite or Gnome.  Erudite appealed to me for the high starting INT, but then I remembered how great the areas in Erud are for socializing.  And everyone can tell you that NOBODY goes to Erud to hang out and have a good time.  It's kinda like my home town, nice place to live.  But it SUCKS if you wanna do anything.  Gotta jump the boat for anything worthwhile.</P><P>So that's why I chose to be Gnome.  True we have a slightly lower starting INT, but equip, experiense, and common sense can more than make up for it.  But that's all just my opinion.  I'm sure there's a reason that everyone plays DE necro's.</P><P>But yah, Human's SUCK.  Unless you're just learning the game in which case yah go human.

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> I know this will be beating a dead horse, but here goes anyways.  Since the changes to exp loss have been made, and you cannot lose exp until 12, who cares?  Make your necro and have fun.  That's what this game is about.  Make a necro, ask others in game for tips, be polite and have fun with it.  I would say 90% of the time people will respond to questions about how to do something.  Just be polite.  As far as starting int, who cares who gets more because + int items are incredably easy to get.  Personally I chose an Iksar and I noticed something.  I have 2 friends in an old guild I used to group with all the time.  Their played time is about 4 times what mine is, and there is a 2 level difference between us.  These two are a barbarian warrior and a barbie shammy.  You can argue the time it takes to go from 49 to 51 as much as you want, but simple truth is I will be 51 with less time than they did it.  Take this Iksar Necros word for it, the exp penalty is not really worth mentioning.  That being said, there is another reason for chosing Iksar.  We are the only race truely home on Kunark.  Think to the "noraml" levelling progression for Old world and Kunark.  Old World is race noob area, East Commons, North Ro, Oasis, Lake Of Ill Omen, Frontieer Mountains, Overthere, then Dreadlands or Velious, etc.  Kunark is typically Field of Bone, Kurns Tower, Lake Of Ill Omen, Frontieer Mountains, Overthere.  Your going to be on Kunark most likely from 15 till 35 or so, you might as well be home there.  KoS will only come in to play when you are in the Overthere as Iksar because of the Dragoons (guards) who roam the zone at night.  Really, the KoS bit takes effect after we have Harmshield (10 sec invinciability), Fiegn Death (self explanitory), invis (self Explanatory).  Faction has no real effect until we can do something about it.  However Sgt Slate in East Commons with Dark Elves is another story.  Using that as a starting off point is really pointless.  Lower starting int ok, it may hurt a tiny bit with reguards to raising skills in the beginning, but by level 25 or so you should be fine there.  Dark Elf &gt; Iksar in night vision, but Iksar is not night blind and the night has never been a problem for me.  I forget where the base resists are, but suffice it to say Dark Elf and Iksar are relatively balanced there (I know Iksar have a 35 fire resist but only a 15 cold resist, all others at 25).  When you are tanking, you have better AC than other classes (lower levels "&lt;15" only).  Regen does help a bit, and it really depends on what you have.  Post 50, it makes a huge difference in my opinion, then again, I have items to make me regain mana faster, so I need to be in Lich (hit points to mana) for less time to get to full mana.</P><P>I would personally leave the Erudite Necros out of it.  Just because they are really isolated in where they can hunt until level 8 (iksar can go to swamp of no hope, noob area in Lake of ill omen, noob area in warsliks woods, or field of bone).  In my opinion killing the same things over and over again just isn't worth the extra int they start with especially when int is so easily raised.  But the validity of that argument depends on what you think you will enjoy doing in game.</P><P>Gnomes, I know little about, and haven't played them.  I can't say much about them here.</P><P>Humans, well as to humans I can say only one thing.  They are middle of the road.  Not good not bad.  There is always a better choise for a certain class than the humans.</P><P>Dark Elves.  Here's where I will make some enemies.  I personally feel the city is too complicated for a low level.  3 zones for the city plus it is only easy to navigate to those who have been there before.  I found myself (before I knew about eqatlas.com) accidently zoning alot because I got turned around.  I am using the same int argument as I did about the erudites, and adding in that the young kodiaks will jump you in the noob area there.  Not a problem as you can easily kill them at level 12 when you will take an exp loss from death, but an annoyance anyways.  The quests are ok, and they do suffer faction problems I would consider much worse than the Iksar.  Try hunting Karnors or Howling Stones when on Kunark.  You will be KoS very quick to your outpost on Kunark.  Same will happen if you hunt the much less populated Kaesora.  3 zones with nice loot you cannot really hunt if you want to have a place you can easily and safely sell to on Kunark.  Otherwise, I have to disagree with an earlier comment about half the time your looking at a necro when looking at a dark elf.  Usually it is a chanter, at least for me, but that has no real point here.</P><P>Iksar.  Higher AC (that really only makes a difference when needed at lower levels), regeneration, and *most* players are going to be by you for grouping if you choose to do so post level 15 with no real need to even worry about KoS until the 30's or so, in my opinion make the Iksar an excellent choise for a necro.  However, you will hear people harp on the exp penalty Iksar have, but ask any Iksar Necro if they really noticed it and they will most likely say no.  While the Iksar Necro quests do, well, lets just say verant left the stick up there when  we were bent over getting it like all the other necros, there are at least original and seem to have a common theme.  There are only 2 things I would change about my race as a necro.  First, I would make me look like an Iksar Skele when I take on skele form, and 2nd, I would have a sign painted on me saying I am not an Enchanter, but an Iksar Necro.  Then again, I usually hunt with my afk message saying Iksar necro, not a chanter.  What chanter in their right mind would solo here?  So I guess it's not a big deal.</P><P>I tried to be as direct with why I made my choise as possible.  Hope this helps you and you enjoy your necro whatever race you choose.</P><P><BR>Lizalfos Deathscale</P><P>Edited by - Lizalfos on 07/19/2002  14:53:25</font></td>
