														September 9, 2003 <br />------------------------------ <br /><br />*** Lost Dungeons of Norrath Launches! *** <br /><br />Make sure to check out this groundbreaking new expansion! EVERY new zone has something fun and rewarding just waiting for everyone levels 20-65, and there's always something available for you! <br /><br />For the first time in EverQuest you have the ability to interact with your environment in new and exciting ways! Find that chest at the end of the dungeon, but approach it carefully - It may be trapped. <br /><br />In addition, there have been rumors of a new type of treasure that allow you to improve your existing equipment, augmenting what you've already earned with new power... <br /><br />Succeed and be rewarded as YOU choose! Those who best the Lost Dungeons will find that the Adventurers have quite the cache of treasure that they've discovered on their own. It seems that, the more you help them in their cause, the more they're willing to share... <br /><br />If you have purchased Lost Dungeons, thank you and welcome! <br /><br />If you haven't -- What are you waiting for? Order now and join the grand Adventure! <br /><br /><br />*** Game Updates *** <br /><br />** Items ** <br /><br />- Warrior and Magician epic changes –– A new version of these two epic items is available to accommodate the new item augmentations. Both of these epics are basically summoned items, and therefore they would lose any augmentations when used or unsummoned. Players wishing to change these items into "permanent" versions in order to augment them should do the following: <br /><br />Warrior Epic - Talk to Gartrog Smitehammer in East Freeport. He will replace your Red Scabbard and Jagged Blade of War with augmentable versions of the Jagged Blade of War, the Blade of Strategy, and the Blade of Tactics. You will not receive the Red Scabbard back, as it will no longer be useful to you. <br /><br />Magician Epic - Talk to Ilisiv Gantrau in the Tox Forest. She will take a summoned Orb of Mastery and replace it with a permanent augmentable orb. The epic pet is still summoned in exactly the same way, with no changes to the spell or use. <br /><br /><br />** Zones and Quests ** <br /><br />- Plane of Mischief - We have updated the factions for a few NPCs for this zone on Stormhammer only. All of the NPCs there are meant to be aggressive. Some of them were on the wrong faction, and were not aggressive. They are now. <br /><br />- The Deep - There were some NPCs in this zone that could see invisible but were bugged to be non-aggressive. They will again be aggressive, so be more cautious when using invisibility in The Deep. <br /><br />- Plane of Valor - The Aerin'Dar projection was despawning after only a few minutes. It will now remain as long as other projections. <br /><br />- City of Mist - Black Reavers are immune to magic once again. <br /><br />- Oxidized Steel Plate will now drop. This should allow the completion of the Rallican’s Bracer quest <br /><br />- The Ghost of Kindle has returned. <br /><br />- Manastone is no longer usable in The Hole. <br /><br />- The trader limit increase mentioned in the last update should be working properly now. <br /><br /><br />** Spells ** <br /><br />- We have reduced the cost of the Summon Wooden, Stone and Iron Bracelet spells. <br /><br />- We have added new Skeleton models for pets, illusions, and transformation spells. <br /><br />- We have changed the underlying way that pet focus items work to allow for future upgrades and items. All existing foci should work as they always have. If you notice anything unusual when using a pet focus, please /bug report the issue. <br /><br /><br />** Interface ** <br /><br />- Context Tips - We have added a question mark symbol to windows that have help information available. Just click on the question mark in the upper right of the window to see the tips. <br /><br /><br />** Miscellaneous ** <br /><br />- Fixed a bug that was causing NPCs to appear to have a larger melee range than they should have in some cases. <br /><br />- Sullon Zek - There was a bug that allowed players to create characters on opposing alliances. That is no longer possible. If you see this message: <br /><br />"You currently have characters created on opposing deity alliances. You can only have characters that are on the same alliance. Please correct this by deleting the character that was recently created and has an opposing alliance with the first character you created." <br /><br />You will not be able to log in until you delete any characters that are not on the same alliance. <br /><br /><br />** UI Files ** <br /><br />* Changed * <br /><br />SIDL.xml <br />EQUI_Templates.xml <br />EQUI_Animations.xml <br />EQUI.xml <br />dragitem27.tga <br />window_pieces01.tga <br /><br />* New * <br /><br />EQUI_AdventureRequestWnd.xml <br />EQUI_AdventureMerchantWnd.xml <br />EQUI_AdventureLeaderboardWnd.xml <br />EQUI_AdventureStatsWnd.xml <br /><br /><br />** Known Issues ** <br />  <br />This is the list of cosmetic issues that we're aware aren't perfect, but determined as acceptable to launch with, as none should affect peoples' ability to enjoy the game.  <br />  <br />Rather than attempt last-minute changes that often break more than they fix, these will be addressed in an update after Lost Dungeons' launch. <br />  <br />- Paladins and Shadowknights:  The new INSPECT and OPEN ability buttons will *appear* disabled for the duration of your Harm Touch or Lay Hands timers when you use those abilities.  You may still use INSPECT and OPEN, however.  It just won't look like you can. <br />  <br />- When receiving an adventure from one of the Wayfarers' Camps, for now, the Adventure Window does not automatically close when you walk away from the Adventure Recruiter as it should.  <br />  <br />- Pet Users:  If you tell your pet to attack an interactive object (chest, vase, coffin, etc) inside of a dungeon, your pet will tell you that it is attacking, but it will not actually attack.  This is a problem with the message, not the behavior.  The pet should be telling you that it cannot attack such a thing. <br /><br /><br /><br />** Use Augmentations Wisely ** <br /><br />If you have an item with more than one slot available and you intend to apply an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot (i.e. Type 1), be sure to apply it last. <br /><br />For example, you have an item with three slots available and you have filled Slot 1 with an Augmentation Item. In your bag you have an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot on the item (i.e. Type 1) and one that fits into Slot 2. If you use the Type 1 Augmentation Item first, it will fill the first open slot on your item, which would be Slot 2 in this case. This means you will not be able to use the Slot 2-specific Augmentation Item you had available. <br /><br />So, remember, the rule is that if you have an Augmentation Item that can be used it any slot, be sure to apply it last! <br />

														August 26, 2003<br />------------------------------<br /><br />** Zone Revamps **<br /><br />- The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and The Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule have been partially revamped. Gameplay in these zones has been improved, based on feedback from players and careful review of the content. The changes are not dramatic, but make these zones more entertaining to play in.<br /><br />- The Plane of Mischief, home of the trickster Bristlebane, has undergone an extensive revamp. As one of the most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone is a very interesting challenge, if you have a sturdy funny bone. The improved zone is now available on Stormhammer.<br /><br />- The Greig's End revamp is now available on the Live servers. The redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group.<br /><br /><br />** Interface **<br /><br />- /memspellset # - Using this command memorizes one of your saved spell sets. # is the number or name (or shortened name) of the spell set you wish to memorize. Note that if you use a shortened version of the spell set name, it will match the first spell set that has those characters, so /memspellset Dots will find your "Dots and Charms", or "Dots", or "Dotsandstuff" - whichever shows up first on your list.<br /><br />- A Platinum slot has been added to the shared bank to make transactions between characters on the same account more convenient.<br /><br />- Clip Plane - The clip plane slider should work more reliably now. Where before it may not have done anything until lowered to a very low percentage, now the slider should have an effect at any setting.<br /><br />- Filters for your own pet's messages have been added. Your own pet's attacks are no longer subject to the Other Attacks/Misses filters. On the options screen there is now a separate button for filtering YOUR Pet attack messages. Also, the ability to redirect your pet attack messages to any chat window has been added to the chat window context menus.<br /><br />- /random messages can now be sent to any chat window you'd like. There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, people can't claim that they didn't see the /random that they lost just to force a re-roll).<br /><br />- The Journal Window has been changed to make it easier to use and understand. We've merged the the two information windows into a single window.<br /><br />- Fixed a bug in the Looking for Group window. The Get Matches button should no longer grey out at inappropriate times.<br /><br />- The Bad Word Filter now filters chat channel text as well as other game text.<br /><br />- To make things a little more logical, the /inspect command will allow characters to inspect interactive objects for LDoN, and /toggleinspect allows you to toggle on or off the ability to inspect other player characters using the mouse.<br /><br /><br />** Alternate Advancement **<br /><br />- Purify Soul reuse time reduced from 72 minutes to 30 minutes.<br /><br />- Divine Resurrection reuse time reduced from 36 hours to 18 hours.<br /><br />- Celestial Regeneration reuse timer reduced from 72 minutes to 15 minutes. We have increased the duration from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, adjusted the amount healed, and made this a group effect.<br /><br />- Celestial Renewal duration increased from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, adjusted the amount healed, and this has become a group effect.<br /><br />- Harmtouch has been fixed. There was a problem with the timer for Harmtouch that would make it appear to reset when the character was logged out, even though it does not reset until the appropriate amount of time has passed.<br /><br />- Summon Death Charger and Summon Holy Steed have been fixed. We fixed a bug that caused these abilities to fail until the character zoned or logged out.<br /><br />- Endless Quiver no longer grants an endless supply of thrown weapons, only arrows.<br /><br /><br />** Spells **<br /><br />- Unswerving Hammer of Faith has had its mana cost reduced from 250 to 175.<br /><br />- Divine Barrier no longer has a damage shield component and has gained three times the healing effect.<br /><br />- Celestial Remedy has had its mana cost lowered from 190 to 150.<br /><br />- A targeting issue with pets is now fixed. There was a bug that caused pets to be untargetable with the F1 key and with pet spells that target the pet automatically. This was happening only if a pet was summoned and then a mount was summoned.<br /><br />- AE Rain Spells were resisted 100% of the time when an NPC was above level 20 and had less than 10% of its hit points left. This will no longer happen.<br /><br />- Eye of Zomm would cause a player's pet to kill itself if that pet was commanded to kill the owner's Eye. This has been corrected. Also, the Eye no longer moves at incredible speed under water, but they can now swim up and down in water.<br /><br />- PBAoE Songs no longer prevent a bard from singing if used while the bard has himself targeted.<br /><br />- Illusions can once again be cast on others while the caster is on a mount.<br /><br />- When Invisibility drops due to looting a corpse, the player will be informed that their invisibility has dropped.<br /><br />- Pets no longer break enthrall. <br /><br />- Armor of the Zealot will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Soul and Focus of the Seventh. Blessed Armor of the Risen and Ancient: High Priest's Bulwark will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Spirit or Khura's Focusing. Also, Pact of Hate and Call of Darkness should stack properly (meaning that they won't stack).<br /><br />- Illusion: Guktan was fixed on all servers a little while ago. We just wanted you to be aware that the spell will make the target look like a Guktan, not a male human.<br /><br /><br />** Zones and Quests **<br /><br />- Bazaar - We have increased the limit on the number of traders in the bazaar. We fixed an issue that would cause the "Begin Trader" button to be disabled if a player tried to use it when the maximum number of traders was reached. And the "Held" slot option was removed from the search, since it is not a valid option.<br /><br />- The Coirnav Encounter has been modified to respawn faster when the encounter is failed badly (if the attempt fails to reach a certain depth in the encounter).<br /><br />- The Illusion: Guktan quest had some issues. We have addressed them.<br /><br /><br /><br />** New Player Improvements **<br /><br />- After creating a new character, that character is the default selection on the character select screen.<br /><br />- At character creation, left-clicking on an attribute displays text that explains what that attribute is important for. Right-clicking allocates the maximum possible points to that attribute.<br /><br />- To help reduce clutter for the new player, the Story window no longer pops up when a player first logs in.<br /><br />- When a context Tip window pops up, if the Tip of the Day is still open, the Tip of the Day window will close. Again, this is to help reduce the clutter.<br /><br />- We've change the name of the "Camp" button in the Actions window to "Camp (Exit)" for clarity.<br /><br />- The Inventory Tip window now explains how to read books and notes, how to give/trade items with NPC's, and how to scribe spells.<br /><br />- We've added a text message on the screen to inform players when they are loading a zone, and what zone they are about to enter.<br /><br />- Added numeric background to buttons in the Hot Button window to make it easier to tell which button corresponds to which number key.<br /><br />- The Mousewheel zoom is now enabled by default.<br /><br />- New installations of EverQuest will default to 1024x768 resolution.<br /><br /><br />** Misc **<br /><br />- Fixed a bug that caused some equipment to be invisible on characters created recently (since our update on August 6th).<br /><br />- Luclin elemental models will now display if selected, regardless of other settings for Luclin models. You can turn these models on with no other Luclin models active, and you will see the Luclin elemental.<br /><br />- Hitting cancel on a trade window or using the /consent or /deny commands will now only send you one message, not two.<br /><br /><br />** UI Files **<br /><br />* Changed *<br /><br />EQUI_BankWnd.xml<br />EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml<br />EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml<br />EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml<br />EQUI_JournalNPCWnd.xml<br />SIDL.xml<br />EQUI_Animations.xml<br />EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml<br />EQUI.xml<br /><br />dragitem26.tga<br /><br />* New *<br /><br />dragitem27.tga<br />window_pieces06.tga<br />window_pieces07.tga<br /><br />* Removed *<br /><br />EQUI_JournalTextWnd.xml
