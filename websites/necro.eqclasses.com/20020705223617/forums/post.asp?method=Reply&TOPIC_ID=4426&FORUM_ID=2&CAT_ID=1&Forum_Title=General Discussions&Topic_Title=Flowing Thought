        <td bgcolor='black' valign='top' width='100%'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Just something I would like to bring up regarding flowing thought items and the necro class.</P><P>First, let's look at the benefits of a flowing thought item to the following classes:</P><P>#1 Cleric:  Since healing is one of the most important components to any successful raid, it is very likely that any cleric-wearable flowing thought item will be considered for clerics first.  Taking into account that with clarity 3 the clerics gain 17 mana per tick, a ft3 item will give nearly 18% increase in mana regeneration.</P><P>#2 Wizard:  Wizards get very little innate mana regen, so again, every bit helps.  18% increase over ft3.</P><P>#3 Magician:  Ditto.</P><P>So far, all the previous classes have gained a substantial benefit.</P><P>Let's skip down to the bottom of the list:</P><P>#86,364 Necro:  Since our mana regen with Arch Lich is 35/tick, giving us the highest rate of regeneration in the game (approximately twice that of c3), Verant has had the foresight to make out most useful spells have double the mana requirement of most other similar damage spells.  For example, the wizard spell ice spear does 1200 dmg with 300 mana (instantaneously mind you) giving a damage to mana ratio of 4:1.  The mage spell shock of fiery blades is 1005 dmg for 334 mana, with a 3:1 ratio.  Now necro:  our best dd spell of 720 for 405 gives a ratio of only 1.7:1.  But you say "yes, but the spell does 2 things at once, both damaging the mob and healing you."  Absolutely true, but the healing part is to make up for the health loss we incur during mana generation.  So in the end, with Verant's careful thought, they DID balance the necro class.  Let me restate that, THE NECRO CLASS is BALANCED in regard to mana regeneration + damage + healing.</P><P>However... due to the nature of the huge mana regeneration we get, which is in the end eventually paid for by the loss of hitpoints which we must recover in lifetaps, a flowing thought item has just been reduced to 1/2 effectiveness for the necro class.</P><P>In other words, a flowing thought 4 item is as beneficial for us as a ft2 item is for nearly every other class due to the necro's mana regeneration.</P><P>So what am I saying with all this?  You decide.</P><P> </font></td>

Under your logic that melees would be balanced with each other.  However it is not, because the difference in rogue DPS vs warrior DPS would narrow as a percentage.  Warriors would go from doing 75% rogue damage, to more like 90%.</P><P>In the same way, if your whole raid had acess to FT 15 items this would be almost a 50% increase in mana for clerics, but only 10-15% for necroes and shaman.</P><P>However, almost all FT is not all that great.

Support to this claim:</P><P>1) The lich series converts at a equal exchange rate. Notice *RATE*. No matter if you had hp regen of 10 a tick or one million a tick, your damage output would still be dictated by the amount of mana that flows through lich.</P><P>2) You fail to realize that lifetaps ARE efficient. Deflux costs about 200 mana (189?) and deals 330 damage. Damage/mana ratio is very bad BUT damage is not the only this that is accomplished. You are also healed 330 points. That 330 more hp to feed to lich, and (thanks to the 1:1 ratio of lich) eventually it turns into 330 mana. So the NET TOTAL of deflux is 330 points of damage and a gain of 141 mana. You actually GAIN mana for dealling damage. Nice deal, huh? Dont believe this? Get low on HP and oom and go to a mob that wont hurt you (soulbinder maybe) and start periodically casting deflux with lich on while standing(never med). You will be FM and full health long before you would if you were to regen HP and mana will standing without lich. Casting VM will only amplify this incredible mana efficiency. By using deflux AND splurt, I am able to deal 660 more damage to a mob for less mana than I would if I were only using splurt.

Well, you get X% more mana withOUT staying in AL X% longer when you use FT over regen. It would be a similar case to compare scourge and ebolt. They both deal the same damage, but ebolt deals the damage NOW as opposed to later.</P><P>As stated in reason #1, we are limited by the convertion of lich, not by HP regen. As stated in #2, it is actually benificial to tap because the hp/mana ratio is better than that of lich(pvp factor and all). As stated in #3, FT and regen are very similar in actual increased production, but FT increases our power per tick beyond that of AL, while regen only extends the length of time we can abstain from tapping(which should not be abstained from as proved in #2). All of these factors combined give more than enough reason to say that FT is superior to regen. But this is only based on numbers. Other factors can affect the worth of these two effects. Rarity of one effect(regen) over the other can change their respective values. Inability to find enough mobs to spend your "increased power per second" can make FT worthless. Trends in item stats with these effects can also change their desirability. FT over regen mentallities require you to cast in order to regain HP, sometimes you don't have this luxury(FD). Also, when FT reaches rediculously high lvls, you cannot spend it all. I would take 1000 hp per tick over 1000FT because you can do much more with the HP than the mana, but this is VERY unlikely to ever happen.</P><P>In my current gear, guild, hunting ground situation, I would take X amount of FT over X amount of regen any day.</P><P>Rahant<BR>55th Boner<BR>Rallos Zek Server</font></td>

Any regeneration rate is not relevant.  Taps are part of our damage source.  If there were better fast nukes or another line of say, cold based dots then maybe tapping would be less inefficient.
