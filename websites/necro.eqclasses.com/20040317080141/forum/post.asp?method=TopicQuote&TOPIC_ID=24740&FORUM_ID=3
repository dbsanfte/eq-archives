[br]I posted this in General discussion and someone suggested that I post it here where it belongs [}:)].  It's important to note to right of zone in there are 6 wrulons you can solo but you must root/rot due to roamers.  The 3 spawns by the SE basement have a cycle so if you keep all 3 Wrulon Guards killed then Protectors, Sentries, etc spawn in their place and they are far more likely to drop stuff.  This is a much better camp not just because you can aggro kite with pet but also because drops are far more common.



Its easier than you think and it can be done. The only place I've done it well is by the SE basement. Head towards SE basement and go past the 3 wrulons but stop before you go down the stairs heading to the basement, turn around. You will notice 2 sides. On each side there are 2 Valorous Guards, a small set of steps, and another Guard. Right out front there are the 3 wrulons. You can aggro kite them all and I ussually keep around six at once killed but if you have BOT you can keep 7 at once killed. 

Buffs


Shield of Maelin
Sow(have potions)
Seduction of Saryn-must have
Force Shield-strongly recommended
Virtue-must have this or at least POT9,temp, Brell's some good HP buffs unless you have 3k or so HP's unbuffed then you should be good

Spell Lineup
Vexing Mordina or Saryn's Kiss
embracing darkness-must have 
BOT(if you have if not use Funeral Pyre)
Pyrocrour
Dark Plague
Shackle of Spirit(for the Valourous Guards if you want)
Comatose(Death Peace works well too)

Highly Recommended
Ceramic Skull of Decay-if you don't have one grab a Naki's ring in bazaar it's summoned and ussually costs about 15 plat.. YOU MUST HAVE SPELL HASTE




PICK A SIDE!! stick to one side. All you have to do is pull the Valorous Guard closest to the wall(should be a single). I stand as far away as I can so I can get an FD off if it resists. If you have pet hold AA that is useful as well. Stay as close you can to the wall and on the darker part of the marble floor. Run it from the wall around the column there and then back around to the column by the stairs leading to the basement and around that. As long as you don't step out past the first set of tiles the other Valorous Guards should not argo you. When you first start out doing this it can be a bit tricky so I recommend slowing after you snare just until you become a pro at it. Also, if darkness wears off you can FD and pet can handle tanking it for awhile then you can pop up and snare again.

Kite the one Valouros. After that you pull the other by the median(on your side). You will have to split this time so FD-send pet or snare and then FD split.. up to you. Kill the 2nd valorous and then the 3rd one on your side right up the steps. You don't have to worry about the other one argo'ing because of the median between them. Once you're done killing all 3 valorous then go and FD split the 3 wrulons. On your way back just make sure you pull the Wrulons to the side you've already wiped so they don't argo anything else and don't get too close to any of the 3 Valorous's left.

If you have the timing of the camp down you should have a nice big space to aggro kite the Wrulons in. Run them from the wall to the steps and back again. I DON'T run around the columns when kiting the Wrulons because they will get caught up and a pathing bug causes them to fall in odd places. You have plenty of room so with a spell haste just use it. The cool thing is they run at 12 percent so you're good after that. It's important to have the 3 Valorous on that side killed so they don't pop when you are killing the Wrulon. If they do just FD and take pet loss. If you see them pop just root/rot the Wrulon and finish it off. If you can keep a room of 6 Valorian Guards killed in the basement you should have no trouble doing this with a little practice. If you can't do that then just kill the 3 Valorous Guards and then 1 or 2 Wrulons by kiting. Actually, doing that is a good idea at first until you get used to it.

I have got longblades of Vitality here, etheral and specs, Wrulon eye, Band of the risen, cape of the proud, defender's lightblade, and another really sweet range item. This stuff sells really great

I am on Prexus server so if this confused you and you'd like me to show you send me a tell. Also, as far as I know it can only be done by the SE basement where the Valorous Guards can all be snared and don't summon. The Wrulon protectors,guards, and sentries all do not summon and can be snared. Do NOT FUCK with the rabid Wrulon I cannot stress this enough. 


IMPORTANT 
Out front you will see a roamer named LT just look for him when you pull the wrulons. This is why you have to pull the wrulons down the small set of steps and aggro kite in that area and why the Valorous guards must be killed to get the Wrulons.

With DC pet, you can keep whole camp clear all the time.<br />Once you have your DC pet, you can't go FD nor suspend your pet.

In this case I would go FD, lose DC pet, and wait another 1 hr 12 min and try again. You should be getting 2 Spirits on the first pull, then 1, then another 2, and finally 1. You can clear all 6 in 12 to 14 min. Now inside of SE building being all cleared, pull Wrulons. ED 1, and run around circle untill you have enough distance to snare second, and same for third. If you have AE4 focus and decent FT gears mana won't run out in 20 min(repop time) with keeping all 9 mobs killed. AH4(ceramic skull) is a must.<br />I'm not sure if the Eye still drops, but I have looted 2 Longblades in 11 kills(counting only Wrulon Guards) so far. And those Spirits drop Lightblades too.

The Longblade of Vitality rate has been greatly lowered, drape of the proud is more common for drops, the Wrulon Eye use to not drop or was very super rare, over 120 AAs with no drops, 50 AAs with 3 dropping.  Havent seen a valorian insignia since my perception of the initial nerf, it was rare anyway, so hard to say on it.  Some ring of the risen, only had it drop once, and this was before what I saw as a nerf to the drop.<br /><br /><br />     I personally feel they screwed the drops up on the Eye, and they went in a fixed it some, and adjusted the rest of the loot table.  They might have bigger fish to fry, but while your in there messing with one thing, it doesnt take too much to adjust others I am sure.  Could of been random luck on what I saw was another nerf, and the effects of the original one, but I will stand by the original one I percieved.<br /><br /><br />     I use to get 2-3 Vitality swords a week to sell, now its super rare, and from looking in the /bazaar , I can see its not just me.  A lot got put into circulation before the nerf, but dont see many new ones going in now.  The drop rate on the drape and the sword were about equal, I have gotten 6 drapes in the last week of not playing a ton, and no swords in the last sampling.<br /></span></font></td>

I thought I might give it a try tonight. The plan is to agro a DC'able, invis up and run like buggery to the SE camp. Snare the soon-to-be-DC pet when he arrives, invis up and run inside. Then do the usual 'snare pull through mobs' FD flop routine.<br /><br />Of course getting indirect agro and not having to snare would help but either way it should work.<br /><br />Famous last words - smile.<br /><br />Rhys</span></font></td>

The camp is less forgiving but if you have some skills you shouldn't have any problem with it.

I was there today and yesterday.  I used to get the occassional sword and a few drapes.  You could pretty much count on a drape every 3-4 hours(I sold several for 10k).  I camped it yesterday for 5 hours and a friend camped it after I left for about 6 hours.  The next day I camped it again for about 6 hours and he did it again for a couple of hours.  We noticed absolutely no drops but the tail and the paws are now pretty common.  You can count on these if you're doing those quests(that are virtually worthless).  specs and etherals are still rare.  I noticed nothing else worthwhile dropping.. not off several sentries, many guards, and protectors(that commonly drop a drape or sword).  <br /><br />Anyways, looks they've pretty much ruined what was a good money camp. On the brightside, if I bring a DC pet there I can keep 4 spirits and 3 wrulons killed so it's decent exp and rarely ever camped.  If anyone gets anymore drops there let me know.  I don't know if they just stopped all drops or made them extremely rare.</span></font></td>

Also, i don't understand how you can pull the wrulons which are out of sight from the side you clear as you can't see them when u try and cast from the side (can target from a long way away on lower level, on opposite side to the one i cleared) and you can only see them from the other side (which you haven't cleared of mobs). Am I doing something wrong? pulling from the wrong place? The only way i could see being able to pull all the wrulons is if I team up with someone else to enable clearing of all the spirits first (was duoing with my brother who's a 65 mage and we could just about keep all the spirits clear, but didn't have enough time to pull all wrulons so would have to have a 3rd person).
