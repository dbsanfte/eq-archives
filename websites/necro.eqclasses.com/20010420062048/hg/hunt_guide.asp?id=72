This ring is located in the NW corner of the zone. The spawn is VERY fast, around 3 minutes or so.  3 spawns of 3 minutes each means this is very fast XP for all levels from 24 to 34.  Loot is quite good.  Druids drop up to 3pp and often FS blunt weapons. They drop quite a few gems including emeralds, opals, and peridots, and occasionally black pearls.  Treants drop tons of coins and sometimes a Great Staff.<br><br>

A group of 2 mages and 2 necros is the best set up I have found in 10 levels of hunting here.  The mages can supply your pets with weapons and their air pets are extremely important assets because of their stunning spells.  Druids rarely do any real melee damage but their DoTs hurt...a LOT and mages' air pets keep them from buffing themselves or hurting you.<br><br>

While hunting them, do not bother to buff yourself or your pet. Your mana will barely be able to keep up with the spawn rate.  It is a rare occurrence to ever have more than 50 percent mana while hunting these. It is simply constant killing, looting, and meding...but very fast so never gets boring.  Another reason not to buff is that if you get hit by a DoT, you can cancel it without any buffs getting in the way.<br><br>

Easiest way to break the spawn initially is to just fear away 2 druids and kill the third. Then kill the 2 feared ones as they come back.  Once the spawn is broken, hang on to the pace of the spawns for dear life.  However, once you get in a rhythm, things will go smoothly.  Danger is almost non-existent once you get some experience hunting there.  Broon, Droon, and Proon spawn near there but will never come up near the druid ring unless disturbed by other players.  Even if they do come up, pets make good sacrificial lambs and the bridge to North Karana or the zone to Beholder are not too far away. <br><br>

This sounds like the perfect place to hunt, and it is.  There are problems however with trying to find a group.  You can't solo it because the spawn is much much too fast to keep up with alone.  And while druids fall like leaves when in a group, they can do some serious damage when they're on equal footing.  This is not a very widely known hunting spot, unlike the 2 Treant spawn in South Karana.  Many people seem reluctant to leave the crowded South Karana for some reason only the gods would not.  However, you would still have the best chance raising a group in South Karana as where the vast majority of level 24's to 34's hang out.  Once you do have a good group, the XP and pp will start flowing in like water.</td></tr><tr><td width='98' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma' size='2'>Author</td><td width='499' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma'size='2'><a href ='mailto:'>Lissena Bladestorm</td></tr><tr></table><br><br><table border='0' width=611><tr><td width='100%' colspan='2' bgcolor='#21456B'><p align='left' style='word-spacing: 0; margin: 0'><b><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Additional Comments</font></b></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Sayleth</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>First of all, once you have experienced this place, the first thing you will want to do is to run back to SK and laugh like a madman at people waiting HOURS on lists for 2 Treants every 6 minutes. You have here the exact same level range (23-27) mobs, but 3 of them that spawn TWICE as fast. Like the author says, the best set up is 2 necros and 2 magicians. Pets are a big plus here, and the magicians can nuke better that you, but you have better mana management. Tank classes are useless here, and they will just end up getting killed, or sitting out a few fights. Don't waste time/mana on self or pet buffs.<br><br>

To break the spawn, the only tactics you need is to make sure everyone targets the same druid at nice. Something like "halfling male first, then Treant, then wood elf male". For best results, send in pets, then alternate SoP and your best lifetap, until the druid is dead. You will get swarmed, but who cares, that is what lifetap is for. They will also careless lighting you and whatever fire DD they have. With 4 pets and 4 necros/mages nuking, the druids lifespan is measured in mere seconds, like 6-10. Keep Allure of Death up as much as possible.<br><br>

Four in the group is ideal for maximum XP/efficiency, but you may want 5 to deal with AFKs and LDs. Six is still worlds better  than those SK Treant campers are ever going to get.  Once the spawn is broken up you can hold it with 3 casters, but it is tough to do.<br><br>

XP: with 4 guys in the group, you will make over a bubble an hour all the way thru 29. If you have four 24s there, you will clear close to 2 bubs an hour while you are in 24.<br><br>

Loot: Awesome. In terms of pp per hour, this rivals Giant killing. In the 13 or so hours I have spent there, I saw 8 black pearls drop, countless other gems, FS every 3rd kill, and coin up to 5pp. They also drop level 20-24 research components. The biggest problem is dealing with all of the coin/FS you will be collecting. If you are a DE, there is no where to sell in the zone. But, other races can sell to a merchant in one of the huts, you will have to dodge guards, but it can be done quite easily. I don't know the name of the merchant, as I cant sell to him/her. Ask around.<br><br>

Safety: If it weren't for your fellow EQ idiots, you would have literally nothing to fear here. But, occasionally, you will have some Druid kite Droon (not so bad, as your group can probably kill him) or worse, Proon through your hunting ground. Still, as a necro, you should easily be able to avoid death as you can afford to have Harmshield, FD and Gate memmed since you really only need AoD, SoP, and a Lifetap for the camp.</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Oniuan Minuo</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>First of all, let me confirm any rumor about how good this camp is.  It’s the best camp around for any Necromancer from the low twenties on up to the low 30s.  Things will slow down about 32 or so, but by then you can move on to the Rangers in East and West commons for the same action.<br><br>

What I wanted to add to the fine commentary above is that this camp can definitely be broken by a Duo of level 29 Necromancers.  It can easily be held with that same duo and one more caster.  Let me outline the strategy.<br><br>

The spells to use are simply Fear, Shock of Poison, and Spirit Tap.  One Necromancer has Fear duty and will start the action.  Send pet to one druid, then immediately fear another.  Don’t bother with darkness, you want that treehugger to RUN RUN RUN and get as far away as possible from the camp.  Don’t worry about it breaking, unless it breaks immediately.  Fear is resisted a few times here, but don’t worry recast it.<br><br>

Meanwhile, your partners are doing maximum DD against the druid that is NOT engaged by a pet.  This might be hard to recognize, and if you can’t tell, don’t sweat it.  But it is CRITICAL that everyone team up against a singe druid.  Therefore I recommend that party members choose a pet and /assist that pet once the action starts.  The first druid should fall in no time, followed by the second druid.  By this time the feared druid is returning, but he’s out by Sir Morgan by now and he won’t be back until you’ve mopped up the second druid.  Might even be able to get off a few seconds of meditation before the first spell hits your crew.<br><br>

Once the spawn is broken you will want to simply med up all the time and take them at a good pace.  It’s been my experience that it takes 4 DD spells to take a druid down, so be sure not to overnuke.  Let the pets work their magic, and cast Renew Bones on them once in a while.  With 2 Necromancers and another caster you can hold this camp indefinitely.  I saw 2 bubbles of XP in about 3 hours at level 30, and I got 2 black pearls and over 75pp of various loot.  That’s the best loot. I’ve seen in 10 levels here, but that shows you what you can do.<br><br>

A few variables to consider:<br><br>

If one of the two remaining druids goes immediately agro against one of your crew you will want to be sure to target THAT druid as your first victim.  Their damage isn’t anything to really cringe about, but you don’t want to let one of your buddies be a victim while you are nuking a druid that’s already occupied by pets.  This can easily happen if Fear is resisted more than twice, so watch out for it.<br><br>

You MUST be ABSOLUTELY clear, when breaking this camp, which druid will be feared, which druid will be taken by pets, and which druid to nuke.  When the gauntlet is thrown and chaos ensues you will NOT have time to communicate, so make sure that everyone is aware which one you are fearing, and which one is engaged.  "Fearing the Wood Elf, pets against the Female Halfling, nuke the Human".  If you are partying with members you don’t know, be careful here.<br><br>

A good trio of casters will have a marvelous time, making good money and awesome experience.</font></td></tr></table></td></table></div>
