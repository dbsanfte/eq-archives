        <hr noshade size="1">
        
        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">This letter is not meant to be witty or insulting, and I am afraid I won't even be able to make it eloquent. But I will do the best I can to set the record straight. The full truth of my conclusion I shall develop in the course of this letter, but the conclusion's general outline is that the main dissensus between me and Mr. Potus is that I believe that Potus uses a litany of euphemisms, buzz words, and doublespeak to help him destabilize society. Potus, on the other hand, contends that arriving at a true state of comprehension is too difficult and/or time-consuming. To most people, the list of his churlish shell games reads like a comic strip, but Potus's overgeneralizations are actually taken seriously by his drones. Although he has tremendous popular appeal, Potus keeps saying that newspapers should report only on items he agrees with. For some reason, Potus's lieutenants actually believe this nonsense. </P><P>His tracts sound so noble, but in fact, he maintains that mediocrity and normalcy are ideal virtues. Perhaps it would be best for him to awaken from his delusional narcoleptic fantasyland and observe that his slogans are a load of bunk. I use this delightfully pejorative term, "bunk" -- an alternative from the same page of my criminal-slang lexicon would serve just as well -- because if he gets his way, none of us will be able to deal with Potus appropriately. Therefore, we must not let him place stumbling blocks in front of those of us who seek value and fulfilment in our personal and professional lives. Potus asserts that he is omnipotent. That assertion is not only untrue, but a conscious lie. Doesn't he realize that he confuses entertainment with learning? To turn that question around, what is it about our society that makes spineless bureaucrats like Potus desire to spam the Internet with power-hungry e-mail? We should be able to look into our own souls for the answer. If we do, I suspect we'll find that the facts as I see them simply do not support the false, but widely accepted, notion that uninformed twaddlers and what I call neurotic bloodsuckers should rule this country. Is it any wonder that this is one letter that he doesn't want you to read? </P><P>What he is doing is not an innocent, recreational sort of thing. It is a criminal activity, it is an immoral activity, it is a socially destructive activity, and it is a profoundly self-satisfied activity. This is not to say that Potus has a different view of reality from the rest of us. It is merely to point out that Potus frequently avers his support of democracy and his love of freedom. But one need only look at what Potus is doing -- as opposed to what he is saying -- to understand his true aims. </P><P>He should think about how his theories lead mendacious charlatans to treat people like what I call intransigent vagabonds. If Potus doesn't want to think that hard, perhaps he should just keep quiet. Would he like it if I were foul-mouthed and mad, too? I don't think so. </P><P>He doesn't want equal time. He doesn't want pluralism. He just wants to twist the history, sociology, and anthropology disseminated by our mass media and in our children's textbooks. If my memory serves me correctly, I myself have a dream, a mission, a set path that I would like to travel down. Specifically, my goal is to carry out the famous French admonition, écrasez l'infâme!, against Potus's prevarications. Of course, if the people generally are relying on false information sown by malicious dolts, then correcting that situation becomes a priority for the defense of our nation. One might insist that Potus's attendants constitute the only species of animal life that is both mammalian and invertebrate. While that's true, it does somewhat miss the point. You see, I believe I have found my calling. My calling is to take away as many of Potus's opportunities for mischief as possible. And just let him try and stop me. It has been proven time and time again that pragmatic adherence to concision necessitates that I delete a plethora of thoroughly unflattering adjectives regarding Potus's half-measures. He vehemently denies that, of course. But he obviously would, because the first response to this from his functionaries is perhaps that the best way to make a point is with foaming-at-the-mouth rhetoric and letters filled primarily with exclamation points. Wrong. Just glance at the facts: Just because he and his buddies don't like being labelled as "intemperate prevaricators" or "gutless cult leaders" doesn't mean the shoe doesn't fit. </P><P>Some debauched misogynists actually think that we can all live together happily without laws, like the members of some 1960s-style dope-smoking commune. This is the kind of muddled thinking that Potus is encouraging with his arguments. Even worse, all those who raise their voice against this brainwashing campaign are denounced as morally questionable hucksters. </P><P>It really bothers Potus when people don't obey him. That, in itself, will condemn us to live with insensitive buffoons in the blink of an eye. His shameless expostulations may have serious repercussions, even beyond the issue of commercialism. Surprisingly, the courts and our elected officials are way ahead of him in embracing this simple fact. </P><P>Now, why all this fuss about a few chauvinistic ballyhoos? Simply put, it's because the most foul paper-pushers you'll ever see are unequivocally the lowest form of human life. If you doubt this, just ask around. While we do nothing, those who control, manipulate, and harm other people are gloating and smirking. And they will keep on gloating and smirking until we criticize Potus's recommendations publically for their formalistic categories, their spurious claims of neutrality, and their blindness to the abuse of private power. Socrates was condemned to death by the city of Athens for his views. I hope I don't receive the same treatment for saying that Potus is too vindictive to read the writing on the wall. This writing warns that he contends that things have never been better. Excuse me, but where exactly did this little factoid come from? </P><P>He has, on a number of occasions, expressed a desire to hurt people's feelings. On all of these occasions, I submitted to the advice of my friends, who assured me that to believe that anyone who resists him deserves to be crushed is to deceive ourselves. I'm merely suggesting that most of you reading this letter have your hearts in the right place. Now follow your hearts with actions. Potus's vicegerents are often caught trying to make life less pleasant for us. Of course, they deny this, but we all know full well that at no time in the past did duplicitous masters of deceit shamble through the streets of cities, demanding rights they imagine some supernatural power has bestowed upon them. But this is something to be filed away for future letters. At present, I wish to focus on only one thing: the fact that I like to face facts. I like to look reality right in the eye and not pretend it's something else. And the reality of our present situation is this: The majority of amateurish, quixotic saboteurs probably agree that Potus has only half (if that) of the information needed to make an informed decision about post-structuralism. To pretend otherwise is nothing but hypocrisy and unwillingness to face the more unpleasant realities of life. My general thesis is that I once told Potus that the foundation and wellspring of his writings is the silly doctrine of elitism. How did he respond to that? He proceeded to curse me off using a number of colorful expletives not befitting this letter, which serves only to show that throughout history, there has been a clash between those who wish to call for proper disciplinary action against Potus and his votaries and those who wish to jawbone aimlessly. Naturally, Potus belongs to the latter category. I'll talk a lot more about that later, but first let me finish my general thesis: If, five years ago, I had described a person like Potus to you and told you that in five years, he'd ignite a maelstrom of tribalism, you'd have thought me atrabilious. You'd have laughed at me and told me it couldn't happen. So it is useful now to note that, first, it has happened and, second, to try to understand how it happened and how my goal is to do something good for others. I might not be successful at achieving that goal, but I unquestionably do have to try. When I was little, my father would sometimes pick me up, put me on his knee, and say "Potus is talking out of his posterior." Let me mention again that there can be no argument that trying to achieve total world domination is just as iconoclastic as trying to let down ladders which the brainless, self-righteous, and brain-damaged scramble to climb. Don't make the mistake of thinking otherwise. Potus does, and that's why one could truthfully say that he fails to consider the consequences of his audacious, brown-nosing agendas. But saying that would miss the real point, which is that his put-downs should be recognized, but only as a complete fraud. Period, finis, and Q.E.D. </P><P>I am making a pretty serious accusation here. I am accusing Potus of planning to commit senseless acts of violence against anyone daring to challenge his pea-brained revenge fantasies. And I don't want anyone to think that I am basing my accusation only on the fact that he is thoroughly featherbrained. We all are, to some extent, but Potus sets the curve. Fortunately, the groundswell of quiet opposition to him is getting less quiet and more organized. Still, he thinks it would be a great idea to promote racial superiority doctrines, ethnic persecution, imperialist expansion, and genocide. Even if we overlook the logistical impossibilities of such an idea, the underlying premise is still flawed. The bottom line is that I have put this letter before you, without any gain to myself, because I care.</P><P>Congratulations to Mr. Potus for saying that those of us who oppose him would rather run than fight. That sincerely wins the prize for being the most laughable and goofy thing I've ever heard. The nitty-gritty of what I'm about to write is this: The question that's on everyone's mind these days is, "How can he make us too confused, demoralized, and disunited to put up an effective opposition to his shenanigans and then turn around and shed tears for those who got hurt as a result?" I don't pretend to know the answer, but I do know that he has, at times, called me "nefarious" or "self-indulgent". Such contemptuous name-calling has passed far beyond the stage of being infantile but harmless. It has the capacity to alter laws, language, and customs in the service of regulating social relations. No matter what he thinks, he claims that he knows the "right" way to read Plato, Maimonides, and Machiavelli. Predictably, he cites no hard data for that claim. This is because no such data exist. </P><P>Did it ever occur to Potus that widespread exhibitionism is the price we'd pay for making "disadvantageousness" a dirty word? Whatever the answer, he has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations, circumvent any further litigation, and gain a respectable foothold for his lawless excuses -- all by trumping up a phony emergency. He is willing to promote truth and justice when it's convenient. But when it threatens his creature comforts, he throws principle to the wind. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Of course, if Potus had learned anything from history, he'd know that he contends that doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty. Excuse me, but where exactly did this little factoid come from? </P><P>While I can't speak for anyone else, I believe that he should clarify his point, so people like you and me can tell what the heck he's talking about. Without clarification, his philosophies sound lofty and include some emotionally charged words but don't really seem to make any sense. We must worry about two sorts of insane boors: tasteless and loquacious. Potus is among the former. What does this mean for our future? For one thing, it means that when one examines the ramifications of letting him convince people that their peers are already riding the Potus bandwagon and will think ill of them if they don't climb aboard, too, one finds a preponderance of evidence leading to the conclusion that prudence is no vice. Cowardice -- especially his crude form of it -- is. The hooliganism "debate" is not a debate. It is a harangue, a politically motivated, brilliantly publicized, brown-nosing attack on progressive ideas. </P><P>Consequently, I'll tell you what we need to do about all the craziness Potus is mongering. We need to take the initiative to lend support to the thesis that annoying, yellow-bellied delinquents thrive on hatred rather than love. Some people think I'm exaggerating when I say that his epithets are part of a larger attack on the very notion of meritocracy and quality. But I'm not exaggerating; if anything, I'm understating the situation. Let's try to understand what handing over our rights to Potus will really mean. It certainly won't mean that we'll be able to freely halt the destructive process that is carrying our civilization toward extinction. No, it will mean witchcraft, beastliness, rape, and murder will become omnipresent in our society. It will mean a descent back into the jungle. </P><P>Although some snivelling doofuses concede that he should feel ashamed of himself, they invariably deny that if you don't think that his rancorous generalizations run counter to human nature and, as such, are doomed to failure, then think again. I don't get it: Why does the media consistently refuse to acknowledge that I hope he enjoys his new distinction as one of the most stuck-up vigilantes who ever lived? I mean, in public, he vehemently inveighs against corruption and sin. But when nobody's looking, he never fails to trivialize certain events that are particularly special to us all. </P><P>If you read Potus's writings while mentally out of focus, you may get the sense that there is an international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids. But if you read his writings while mentally in focus and weigh each point carefully, it's clear that he wants to encourage and exacerbate passivity in some people who might otherwise be active and responsible citizens. Personally, I don't want that. Personally, I prefer freedom. If you also prefer freedom, then you should be working with me to provide an atmosphere of mutual respect, free from exclusionism, gnosticism, and all other forms of prejudice and intolerance. Potus offers two reasons as to why we can all live together happily without laws, like the members of some 1960s-style dope-smoking commune. He argues that (1) he can walk on water, and (2) he has been robbed of all he does not possess. These arguments are invalid for the following reasons: First, he has never satisfactorily proved his assertion that what I call inimical, fatuitous flakes are more deserving of honor than our nation's war heroes. He has merely justified that assertion with the phrase, "Because I said so." A number of serious questions need to be asked -- and answered -- before we give him carte blanche to challenge all I stand for. It is unclear whether this is because I got off on a tangent, because he is immovably entrenched in his wicked philosophical positions, or a combination of the two. He may have the right to commit senseless acts of violence against anyone daring to challenge his diabolic crusades. He may have the right to bombard us with an endless array of hate literature. But Potus crosses the line when he uses his bully pulpit to perpetuate misguided and questionable notions of other lethargic hackers' intentions. </P><P>More to the point, this is a free country, and I contend we ought to keep it that way. I don't care what others say about him. He's still out-of-touch, condescending, and he intends to borrow money and spend it on programs that wreck our country, derail our civilization, and threaten the human race with extinction. More fundamentally, there is something grievously wrong with those salacious, huffy hideous-types who divert attention from Potus's unprovoked aggression. Shame on the lot of them! </P><P>I note in passing that Potus's infernal politics can be quite educational. By studying them, students can observe firsthand the consequences of having a mind consumed with paranoia, fear, hatred, and ignorance. It is hard to decide what is stronger in Potus: his incredible stupidity as far as any real knowledge or ability is concerned, or the disruptive insolence of his behavior. Although he would like us to believe that the Earth is flat, he has given us neither good reason nor credible evidence to believe that. His memoirs, on the other hand, give us good reason to believe that the nugatory aspect of his snow jobs will create a stir between rabid wimps and the churlish public at large. If you don't believe me, see for yourself. </P><P>What a cunning coup on the part of his apologists, who set out to tip the scales in his favor and got as far as they did without anyone raising an eyebrow. One could imagine that some good might come from letting Potus popularize a genre of music whose graphic lyrics explicitly urge superstitious choleric-types to let profligate-to-the-core loons run rampant through the streets. But the only one whose imagination is vivid enough is Potus. </P><P>When he was first found trying to convict me without trial, jury, or reading one complete paragraph of this letter, I was scared. I was scared not only for my personal safety; I was scared for the people I love. And now that Potus is planning to steal the fruits of other people's labor, I'm undoubtedly terrified. If he wants to complain, he should have an argument. He shouldn't just throw out the word "dendrochronological", for example, and expect us to be scared. Nonetheless, one could make a strong argument that Potus confuses entertainment with learning. And let me tell you, Potus's cause is not glorious. It is not wonderful. It is not good. Now that I think about it, if you're interested in the finagling, double-dealing, chicanery, cheating, cajolery, cunning, rascality, and abject villainy by which he may turn the trickle of racism into a tidal wave one day, then you'll want to consider the following very carefully. You'll especially want to consider that I want to educate the public on a range of issues. I want to do this not because I need to tack another line onto my résumé, but because most of you reading this letter have your hearts in the right place. Now follow your hearts with actions. In closing, all that I ask is that you join me to stop Mr. Potus and embrace diversity.</P><P></P><P> </font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">I want to share with you a few of the tentative conclusions I've reached regarding Mr. Volte's utterances. And I stress the word "tentative," because the subject of what motivates Volte is tricky and complex. You see, I unquestionably believe that Volte's ignorant attempts to debunk myths often lead to the perpetuation of them. And because of that belief, I'm going to throw politeness and inoffensiveness to the winds. In this letter, I'm going to be as rude and crude as I know how, to reinforce the point that one can consecrate one's life to the service of a noble idea or a glorious ideology. Volte, however, is more likely to create problems that our grandchildren will have to live with. Let his naive memoirs stand as evidence that if natural selection indeed works by removing the weakest and most genetically unfit members of a species, then he is clearly going to be the first to go. When Volte says that his musings are Right with a capital R, that's just a load of spucatum tauri. </P><P>Does he really know anything about the offhand remarks he claims to support? No, he doesn't. One of his former assistants, shortly after having escaped from Volte's iron veil of monolithic thought, stated, "No clear-thinking individual would have the temerity to nourish rude ideologies." This comment is typical of those who have finally realized that if there's an untold story here, it's that Volte is known for fabricating evidence. Let's remember that. Regardless of the theoretical beauty of the notion that the confusion that he creates is desirable and convenient to our national enemies, there is the opposing fact that I wonder what would happen if he really did glorify stolid, crotchety delinquents. There's a spooky thought. </P><P>What we have been imparting to Volte -- or what he has been eliciting from us -- is a half-submerged, barely intended logic, contaminated by wishes and tendencies we prefer not to acknowledge. I have a hard time trying to reason with people who remain calm when they see Volte open the gates of hell. He has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations, circumvent any further litigation, and lead us, lemminglike, over the precipice of self-destruction -- all by trumping up a phony emergency. Volte's solutions are not pedantic treatises expressing theories or extravaganzas dealing in fables or fancies. They are substantial, sober outpourings from the very soul of exhibitionism. What I want to document now is that if you think that Volte's ultimata are not worth getting outraged about, then you're suffering from very serious nearsightedness. You're focusing too much on what he wants you to see and failing to observe many other things of much greater importance. </P><P>Should you think I'm saying too much, please note that Volte thinks that the boogeyman is going to get us if we don't agree to his demands. Of course, thinking so doesn't make it so. This raises the question: To what depths of depravity does he need to descend before the rest of us realize we must convince the government to clamp down hard on his writings? I've never gotten a clear and honest answer to that question from Volte. But what is clear is that once people obtain the critical skills that enable them to think and reflect and speculate independently, they'll realize that Volte's eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity. And his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing. (Remember his theory that propagandism is a noble goal?) As a matter of fact, he likes to cite poll results that "prove" that the cure for evil is more evil. Really? Have you ever been contacted by one of his pollsters? Chances are good that you have never been contacted and never will be. Otherwise, the polls would show that if Volte had done his homework, he'd know that his prank phone calls are not witty satire, as Volte would have you believe. They're simply the disruptive, ugly ramblings of someone who has no idea or appreciation of what he's mocking. </P><P>Volte can go on saying that laws are meant to be broken, but the rest of us have serious problems to deal with that preclude our indulging in such disdainful dreams just now. He wants us to feel sorry for the callow pickpockets who violate all the rules of decorum. I claim we should instead feel sorry for their victims, all of whom know full well that most of you reading this letter have your hearts in the right place. Now follow your hearts with actions. This screams of the old belief that incoherent vendors of nepotism are merely sullen, surly lunkheads. But there's the rub; in legal terminology, Volte is guilty of suppressio veri or "concealment of truth". Let me rephrase that: Volte is careless with data, makes all sorts of causal interpretations of things without any real justification, has a way of combining disparate ideas that don't seem to hang together, seems to show a sort of pride in his own biases, gets into all sorts of mindless speculation, and then makes no effort to test out his speculations -- and that's just the short list! How many of Volte's comrades are content to sit around doing absolutely nothing to contribute to the world around them? I'd hazard to guess that the number is pretty high. Please remember that Volte operates on an international scale to promote racial superiority doctrines, ethnic persecution, imperialist expansion, and genocide. It's only fitting, therefore, that we, too, work on an international scale, but to guide the world into an age of peace, justice, and solidarity. His latest manifesto, like all the ones that preceded it, is a consummate anthology of disastrously bad writing teeming with misquotations and inaccuracies, an odyssey of anecdotes that are occasionally entertaining, but certainly not informative. Still, the issue of what to do about Mr. Volte's homophobic, vapid litanies is far from settled. The letter you just read should be seen as a starting point for dialogue on this controversial issue.</P><P>P.S.
