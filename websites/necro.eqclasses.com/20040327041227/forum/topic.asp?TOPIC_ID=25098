I'll be posting other chapters soon.<br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br /><b><u>A Life of Death</b></u><br /><br /><b>~I~</b><br /><br />Every night I am haunted by a dream. The irony almost makes me smile. In the past I have been the source of many a person’s nightmares yet now I am the victim. It is a strange and new feeling to me. It brings a partial understanding of the horrors that my targets must have dealt with in the last moments of their pitiful lives. I do not fear death as others do. I’ll know when my time on Ondrikoth has come to an end. I’ll probably know well in advance. Many others shall fall before me however. Of that I am certain.<br /><br />It’s always the same. In my dream he is there. We stand in an open field. The air feels electrified. The energy courses through my body, threatening to tear me apart. I look at him and see his mouth moving, however I hear no sounds other than the deafening hum of the energy. It is Recyn, my brother. He has been missing for years. The joy of seeing him again doesn’t last. He looks distressed. I don’t understand what he is trying to communicate to me. His mouth forms words but I hear no sounds. I believe it to be some kind of warning but for what I know not. Suddenly a sharp crack as lightening hits the ground between us. I am knocked down and dazed. <br /><br />When I finally manage to get up I notice that Recyn is gone. Frantically, I look around the field. There is nothing but ice and snow for miles. Then I see it, a Soul Spike. I have never laid eyes upon one, but then few have. This one resides in the cold barren land called Fore, very dangerous even for the most powerful of people. The Spike extends out of a dead forest and stretches into the clouds. It is a grey, gloomy area that never sees the light of the sun. The Spike is believed to gather the souls of the dead and direct them to their final destination. <br /><br />As I stare at it in awe, the electricity begins to build in the air once again. This time, however, I’m struck with a different kind of shock. Amazement, as a blade enters my back. I always wake when my body hits the frozen ground. <br /><br />Interpreting omens from dreams and conversing with the spirits of the dead make up but one part of my life as a Necromancer. Divination is a powerful thing. This dream began when Recyn went missing. Many believe him dead. I know better. When the incident occurred Recyn and I were nearing the end of our training. As I have aged day after day so has he in my vision. Though a fair deal of time has passed I would recognize him today if he stood before me. Dreams never tell you all you want to know nor do they make things clear and straightforward. From this dream I have deduced a few things. That Recyn is still alive; that he is in some sort of trouble; that my path in life will lead me to this Soul Spike; and that I will be deceived somewhere, somehow, the cost being my very life.<br /><br />This night my dream is interrupted. A light stinging sensation in my temples wakes me from my restless sleep. I look up at the moon and realize morning is a still a few hours away. The moon and stars are such an amazing sight. Having grown up in the Southern Wastes where, day and night, there is a constant and complete cloud cover leaving nothing of interest to be seen. A clear sky is a sight seen rarely, when traveling outside the Wastes.<br /><br />From behind me in the darkness I hear a low snarl. I slowly turn not interested in the snarl itself but what it means. My Guardian has sensed an intruder, no doubt the cause of my premature waking. Without speaking I call it to my side and calm it. <br /><br />I use the term it because it is undead and therefore isn’t. Guardians come in many forms. They take on the characteristics of what they once were. I would not go so far as to call them mindless but they carry out, sometimes unwillingly, the wishes of their master. The more recent they are to the world of the dead the stronger their will is.<br /><br />Wolves make great ‘watchdogs’, undead ones I mean of course. The problem with living wolves is they aren’t loyal to anyone but themselves and their pack. You also need to be able to control that nasty howling habit they are so fond of. Otherwise they become a beacon for whomever or whatever may be on your trail. That’s the basis behind all Conjuration aspects of Necromancy, control.<br />Gently I probe the area with my mind in an attempt to identify my unexpected visitor. I sense nothing. This arouses certain suspicions but it is best never to assume anything.<br /><br />Assuming and underestimating are aids to an early death. That was one of the first lessons learned from my father. Cobryn had always been more of a strong instructional figure in our lives than anything else. He had to be hard, almost unloving, having grown up in a world torn by war. Even so he became an emotional mess after mother’s death. When Recyn disappeared he just went numb. He shut himself inside his mind, a seemingly empty shell. I hold out hope he will return to us.<br /><br />A twig snaps reminding me that I’m not alone. “Don’t tell me you’ve lost your touch, sister.” I venture in the general direction of the sound. After a few moments a darkly robed figure walks into the clearing. She grins at me from behind the hood, holding a broken branch in her hands.<br /><br />“Nonsense my dear Drei, I may have stirred you from your sleep but you got caught in your thoughts.” She settled herself down on a log near the remains of a small fire I had earlier in the night. Pulling off her gloves she looked up to me questioningly. “Well won’t you make me comfortable brother?”<br /><br />With a gentle pat, I reassured my Guardian that this was not a threat and sent him back to keeping watch. Without hesitation, he plodded off into the darkness to scout around. I knew he would. This one’s corpse was not so fresh. Watching me from her place near a still unlit fire sat my younger sister Jynoic. She was staring after my Guardian in disgust.<br /><br />“How can you touch that thing?” She shuddered. “It’s all bones and dead skin. There isn’t any fur on it at all.”<br /><br />“I don’t know what you are talking about Jyn.” I smiled. “There’s a clump, or two, of fur left on it somewhere I’m sure.” She shuddered again. “Why does it bother you so? I know you’ve seen your fair share of death.”<br /><br />“I make the dead, not play with them afterwards. Seriously Drei I could never have lived my life as a Necromancer. I don’t know how you do it. I’ll have nightmares of that thing as it is.” she said pointing off towards the wolf.<br /><br />I looked back up at the stars lost in thought. Some would argue that a life of death is a waking nightmare. Whoever they are they are probably right. But this is who I am, who we Unali are. I would choose no other path in life had I the choice to make. <br />Jynoic looked up to the night sky. Softly she said, “Sometimes you think too much, brother, if nothing else that alone could be your downfall.”<br /><br />“You speak more truth than you realize.” I reply grimly. I sigh softly as the last remnants of my dream drift away to a dark corner of my mind. There it patiently awaits my next sleep.<br /></span id="msg"></font></td>
