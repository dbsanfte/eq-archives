         Mags... first off... calm down a bit.</P><P>Secondly... this is only a game hun.  Many more important things in life :)</P><P>Thrirdly... no necro's ever deny the the "Great Nerfage" or whatever you want to call it.  But that happened a while ago under what was BASICALLY (notice I said basically) a different company.  The past is the past... 20/20 hindsight and all that.  Doesn't do any good to look back and freak out over it.</P><P>Of course it does always help to look back and LEARN from experiences.  Which, as a class, I think we did.  We adpated.  We might not have been the monsters we once were.  But we managed :)</P><P>As for twitching or soloing or grouping or raiding or WHATEVER YOU DO IN GAME... it's up to the person.  They pay to play let them do what they want.  No one has to think or play a certain way if they don't want to.</P><P>As for the wizzy thread... interesting, every class has it's rough levels :)  Comparing apples to oranges though only makes a fruit salad (mmmm fruit).</P><P>I understand the desire to want to make a class you have put so much time and effort into better.  Believe me I want it too :)  But we aren't the only ones out there.  </P><P>Soo... here's my take:</P><P>1. Dots won't stack.  It will never happen because the code is so fubar'd that there is no way it can happen.  (No don't argue with me, this is an opinion)</P><P>2. FD mask was fine since there is no cotiere city in which to bank at anyway... and you all wanted to fubar your faction with Katta anyway for the good hunting so no biggie.</P><P>3. CoS - it is THE most overpowered item in the game for us.  Thank god we have it.  Casting time on post-nerfed ones is fine because you can STILL GET AHOLD OF A PRE-NERF one.  Limiting the number of super powered items in the game isn't a bad thing... believe it or not :)</P><P>4. Twitching - do what you have to do.  Refuse or not... whatever, it's your choice.</P><P>5. I hate lists</P><P>Mags... if you really love the game so much and the class so much, play it, don't sit on the MB and write diatribes and rants to get folks riled up.  Especially in such a taunting manner.  It's annoying and pointless.  Just clearly state what you want us to discuss and we will :)</P><P>Nummularia Psychaster<BR>Triton<BR>~I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them.~<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         Mags, I'm just a person like you.  All I post here are my opinions and experiences...  but for shits and giggles I'll answer your questions.</P><P>If you went away today would anything change?  Probably not.  This is the internet, we're not neighbors or high school buddies.  We just post our game play here.  Sometimes we even make friends :)  But mostly it's just a MB... it has no power other than what we put into it.</P><P>If ever I am asked again (& I did not prompt the Wizard, WORD) do I lie? - I don't know if you um ... lied.  You told YOUR version of how you believe the game to be played.  And how you thought wizards have game life compared to necros... telling your opinion isn't wrong... but it's just that.  An opinion.  Even IF you say "this is a fact" and "This happened because I was there!" it is still colored by opinion.</P><P>The key is for that... be true to yourself.  Say it like you think it should be said even if every last necro here screams at you :)</P><P>I don't know about "Truth" as you put it... everyone knows necro's were nerfed in Kunark... but everyone doesn't care.  You see?  They are aware changes were made to our class retroly (is that a word?) that caused the class to quickly be less than what it was before.  But you see... and this is the tough part...</P><P>They Don't Care.</P><P>THEY do not play a necro, and if they do, they may not feel as strongly as you.  Like I said before, what is past is past, learn from it, but don't revel in it to the ignorance of the here and now.  (My I sound like my mother :/)</P><P>Your ethics are your own.  If you want to scream and shout and demand people play games... they will treat you like a 2 year old.  If you calmly state your opinion and the arguments as to WHY you believe it, then that's all good.  It's OK for people to disagree and to refute you :)  It's what freedom of speech is all about.</P><P>It's why the Vision TM doesn't ban ya :)  Because you have a right to your own say no matter what "drama" you cause on the MBs.  After all... they are only MBs :)</P><P>Nummularia Psychaster<BR>Triton<BR>~I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them.~<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         Yes Mam,</P><P>I don't LIKE being the Last Angry Necromancer. It's just I still remember when a young Planes Age Necromancer came here.</P><P>He was asking for help. I think Abu & Zrattz spoke to him. He was trying to get full status in a Guild that had him as a Provisional for something like 3 months. They listen to him. He had been Twitching his heart out for them but the Elders told him to look again. He was never going to get full status. They had been useing him.</P><P>or</P><P>When another Necro came here and told us that to get in a certain Guild that the Guild Master had told him that if he wanted in he would "TWITCH & SHUT UP".</P><P>It gets so hard some times.</P><P>Mags</P><P>Magisterdark Shadowquester,<BR>37 Teir'Dal Necromancer,<BR>Solusek Ro Server</P><P>&lt;img src="http://www.gbsu-usa.net/boss/respect.gif" border=0&gt;</P><P>BURN THEM ALIVE!

         Reasoning behind Mags' annoying style:</P><P>I think Mags is adopting a cryptic and obscure style unique to everyone else's style of writing in order to avoid dealing with us on the same level of discussion. It also allows him to feel and be looked upon as different and unique and likely, on a level above that which we supposedly are on. This leads me to think that his style has evolved from past message board experiences in which he was met with the same hostility in reply to his militant stance. His style of being obscure serves to try and offset any sort of crafted, reasoned reply most people are accustomed to as well as make himself feel superior in being able to confuse others with what he thinks are intelligent replies. If he truly believes in what he is writing, I would say he is seriously delusional. If he is writing this all as a joke, it would be damn well crafted. I'm leaning towards delusional. <BR>Seems that the point of his posts are simply to bitch and whine about twitching but as it is such a minor thing in the game (at least it is for me when I play) I don't see the reason behind getting so angry over it. The only reason I can figure out is that this has become a neutral concept that he can use to gain notoriety from. And doing a good job of it as well I might add. No different it seems than what other people do. People like to become and be seen as experts in some highly specialized area of knowledge. But aggravating the people who play the same class in the process for what seems to be the sake of your own notoriety? What the hell?</P><P>If there is some other reason for him to involve himself in such a minor concept other than for the sake of notoriety, enlighten me. I don't see why else a person would go through this kind of trouble for something I do rarely in downtime situations. I don't see any other point to his posts other than veiled trolling. Although they aggravate me, I generally ignore them if I see them simply because this is what I think he intends these posts to be. </P><P>So what to do? Vision(tm) won't ban him and I believe in Free Speech. <BR>Perhaps this approach is best as others will see the full unmoderated history of his posts and our responses. If he does it on other boards, we can post corrections there when we see them (if we care) and/or give reference to past (unmoderated) threads here. We can adapt to the situation given what we have. Isn't that what we do best<BR>and love about our class?</P><P>And now for something completely different... Nuum's latest approach to dealing with Mags reminded me of a fable in which the North Wind challenges the Sun to see who can remove the coat from a man they saw on the earth the fastest. The North Wind tried to blow the coat from the man but the man held on to his coat tighter as the NW blew harder. The NW gave up and the Sun gave it a go. The Sun just shone on the man. Gradually, the Sun shone brighter and brighter to the point where the man simply took off his coat from the warmth.</P><P>Vathex Inthuul'Chath<BR>59 Defiler / Morell-Thule</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         Sure was a long grind to get to the end of this thread.  My take, for what it's worth... Mags is a classic board troll.  Nothing makes him happier than having his opinion anger someone enough to attack him, so he can return fire.  His opinions seem deeply held, and I can respect his commitment to his ideals.  I disagree with him, and that's MY right.  Not that I expect any respect from him.</P><P>Let's see, I expect to hear about my low post number, so lets take care of that first.  I'm running a currently 34th necro on Luclin, but I have multiple characters over 40 on 3 servers and my main is a 56 wizard.  Mostly I lurk here, gathering information, and I simply don't post to speak of.  I've seen a quite a few raids in my time, and know a bit about the high end game &lt;not endgame, but on up there&gt;. If you're on a big raid and you don't do ANYTHING thats needed and within your power to do when its needful, you're a fool.  Do I want to endure a wipeout on a chardok royals raid because the necro would not twitch a cleric?  Hell no!  You use your spells and skills the best you can.  I suspect that clerics don't get a real big charge out of casting CH over and over on the main tank, but thay damn well do it.</P><P>I'm not defending the whole twitchwhore thing.  Any guildleader who had the gall to tell me that all I was good for was to twitch whoever I was told would be told (damn quickly) to go piss up a rope, followed by /guildremove - not that I would join a guild with such a moron running it.   </P><P>I enjoy my necro a lot.  I don't need to fool with finding a group but I can group if I want. I'm still learning my capabilities.  Maybe I wasn't here for the Great Necro Nerf... but if you think that I have not played classes that were gutted, or owned gear that was nerfed or removed from the game, you're wrong.  Basically any class board you cruise will have threads wailing about how something or other was nerfed and oh the unfairness of it all.  S hit happens, get over it.  Sometimes VI even does something right and helps out a bit.  Either way Mags, shuddup and play.  You take this stuff Waaaaay too seriously.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
