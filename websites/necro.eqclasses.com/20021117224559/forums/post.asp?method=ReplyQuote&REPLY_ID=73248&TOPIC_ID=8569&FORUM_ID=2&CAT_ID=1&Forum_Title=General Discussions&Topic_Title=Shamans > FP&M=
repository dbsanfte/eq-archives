Hmmm being wanted on a raid were all you do is buff and slow... exciting.  Not to mention I know a lot of high end guilds that have as many necros as they do Shaman on a raids.  Infact most guilds are this way.  I don't believe you saw a 2khp heal in that list, just the same old 1200hp heal over time without the bad effects.

The issue is that necro spells SUCK in PoP while shaman's don't.  But do keep in mind these changes are probably beta and in testing  If they aren't changed later, then by all means, commence on the attacks.</P><P>As for the class banter it really comes down to this: what do you want to do.  If you want to sit there doing damage, then yeah, a necro would serve you well (though a wizard, I'd say, would serve you even better).  If you want to buff, heal, and every once in a while land a slow that'll make a raid, then go for the shaman.  There's no ordained rule that says: buffing is bad, damage is good, and I don't see the point of an argument made around that.  Indirect damage is just as important as direct damage, and in many ways just as enjoyable unless you're the damage-freak who'll be better off rolling a wizard anyways.</P><P><BR>Etadanik the Redeemed</font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Why is Pyre so good?  Pyro has a better dmg/mana ratio and does nearly as much damage.</P><P>It's good because it's FAST.  The fundamental (and I do mean that) problem with dots is that most of them take about 2 minutes to run their course.  It's possible to easily land enough dots to drop a critter with over 10k hps, as a necro.  (Try the drachnid widow sometime, she's got a ton.)</P><P>But waiting that long just isn't worthwhile if you are in a group.  Mobs don't live that long.  In Ssra fighting the 1st and 2nd floor snakes, I notice when the group is low on dps because the mob actually LIVES for 54 seconds and dies about the time Pyre runs out.</P><P>You can watch the HP updates on your target every tick, and easily count the kind of damage you are doing.  I have seen Pyre last for about 4 ticks in a typical group situation.  That's right, about as long as Celestial Elixir takes to run is how long the mob takes to die.</P><P>What's the point in this situation of ANY dot that runs in 1.5 or 2 minutes?</P><P>It's a problem that is at the core of dot spells.  I'm getting 960 dmg for 450 mana in a pyre that runs for 4 ticks, and it's the most efficient dot I can cast in that time, although EBolt is not that far behind.  I'm barely outdamaging Touch of Night.</P><P>My contribution in a group in Ssra is mostly healing / mind wrack / crowd control.  I don't mind the role personally, but I realize that for a lot of other necromancers, this isn't what they signed on to do.</P><P>This is something that really can't be fixed.  It's an inherent flaw with dots.  When hunting xp, mobs die way too fast for dots to be useful.  And they need to, because getting 6 people xp requires a lot more dead mobs than getting 1 person xp.  And before you start up about the xp change, consider that this only applies to mobs 55+.  You know, the ones you can't mez as a necro because they are too high level.  Been getting xp off those recently?  Ever?  The only thing the xp change did was make a few selected spots better xp (Juggs, Shik'nar Royals in FG, ... what else?  Castle in Velks? nothing much worth mentioning.) and they never were really that great of xp spots to begin with.</P><P>Sure, dots are nice on boss mobs, where they take awhile to die.  But you aren't going to see super high DPS unless you risk getting summoned and killed.  Being summoned by ordinary mobs I can deal with, but getting summoned by a raid boss that flurries or hits for 600+ is something that you will need luck on your side to get through.</P><P>-Arbaon, Warlock, Luclin Server</font></td>
