        <font color="white" face="Verdana" size="2"> I would like to see our community sustain this thread until VI makes some changes for our class.</P><P>I think it's pretty clear AA skills were primarily developed for Enchanters and Wizards, while Necros and Magi got some half-assed fill-in skills added to our class.</P><P>Many of the Archetype Skills and Class Skills really had no effort given to our class I think. </P><P>The only Arch skills that I think are usefull to us are Mana Regen, SCF, SCM, and Channeling.  Spell casting deftness and reinforcement don't even apply to our class, spell casting expertise is useless to everyone at 60, I don't cast any spell under lvl 52 unless im gating or rooting something. Spell casting subtlety not much use for us when we can just FD anyway and reduce hate completely.</P><P>The Class Skills are even worse in my mind. Massive group Buff :) yeah buddy I'm gonna spend 9AA just to be able to cast group dmf! I didn't ever buy the junk group dmf spell and never will.</P><P>I have yet to think of ANY time I would ever use AE undead fear or the AE undead mezz spell.</P><P>Mend companion is rather pointless, EoT pets have like 1800hps tops. If shadowbond can't keep it alive then mend companion is pretty much useless. Unless of course the reuse timer is moved to 3 min instead of 72 min :)</P><P>Flesh to bone kind fun just to have I guess. Although in all the years I have been playing I can't remember any time I was out of bones chips when I needed them.</P><P>Pet hold not really as useful as it would have been, had VI not made the changes to make pets not attack mezzed mobs.(Cheers to VI for doing that upgrade)</P><P>So we really left with call to corpse (very useful in some small cases, none of which I have run across yet, but I can see a need at some point)</P><P>Dire Charm - Woot! working on this one now :) Just wish there were more places we could use it and get exp. But I LOVE this one :)</P><P>Inate ITU - insta cast ITU can be a lifesaver when logging back in to undead mobs after quitting from FD Im guessing.</P><P>Life Burn - I don't see the value of this one yet. No way I want to be at 1 HP right after I just nuked a mob for 4k. Even if there is no aggro from the spell, you can bet it will aggro because of low life. That and the fact we can't have focus items increase damage, and we can't cit on this, why risk it for 4k when I can do 5k with 2 dots easily.</P><P>I'd like VI to put some more thought into our AA's</P><P>(specifically taking out the friggen junk BS AA's like Massive Group Buff, AE undead fear, AE undead mezz, Mend companion, Spell Casting Deftness, Spell Casting Expertise, and Spell Casting Reinforcement)</P><P>And putting in more useful things like </P><P>a more efficient mana transfer similiar in ratio to Shaman's Can5,<BR> <BR>Criticals for Dots, or Dot Casting Reinforcement simliar to the Spell Casting Reinforcement skill(yes I know there are focus items for this but most focus items are not fixed length most r random effects from 0-20% and they should stack just like increased damage items add to dd crit damage)and before someone says this will unbalance gameplay, remeber dots take a minimum of 42 secs to run thier course before the full hp loss takes effect. While Wiz, Druids, Magi, nuking every 8 secs and can land crits that could easily surpass any damage we could do in 42 secs.</P><P>added HP regen, </P><P>critical group heals or solo heals just like the priest class get (now that they have made us healers :) </P><P>or perhaps massive undead criticals when a crit lands on undead, </P><P>and we of all classes should have a FEARLESS skill.</P><P>I would also like to see them change lifeburn to be more like mana burn. How is it Manaburn can be 1.5-2.0 damage x mana pool, can have damage increased by focus items, and then can crit on top of that making crits of around 18k possible all for 5 AA points, and we can do maybe 4k tops, no focus, no crit, and have 1 HP left to draw aggro when we cast, all for 9 AA points :)</P><P>Lastly, instead of having mend companion how about a new pet buff that increases resistances on pet, I can't stand it when a green mob lands a slow on a EoT pet.</P><P>Cuku - Iksar Warlock<BR>Fire & Fury - FV Server</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=223029" target="_blank">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=223029</a> </P><P></P><P>Edited by - Cuku on 07/15/2002  11:48:52</font></td>

         Well, obviously it was a flame and a nit-picking one too.</P><P>First off, the complete sentence was... Spell casting deftness and reinforcement don't even apply to our class, spell casting expertise is useless to everyone at 60, I don't cast any spell under lvl 52 UNLESS im gating or rooting something.  </P><P>So, it wasn't countering itself 2 lines later as you say. BTW I don't use HS or Quivering, and if on a rare occasion I happen to fizzle on FD or HS/Quivering if I were to ever use them I will recast 1 sec later when it refreshes. You just happen to have run out of AA's to train in and are working on this one. The rest of us in the Necro world are way behind you in AA and can think of better uses of our time.</P><P>Ok I was wrong on the AE fear.. so what.. the concept is the same. When, if ever would you use it? I see you personally choose not to pick that AA.</P><P>By taking the effort to point out 2 minor points, and then say you wouldn't support any of it because I said the Fear AE is undead, instead of just a AE fear is pretty dam lame.</P><P>It's people liek you who degrade posts intended to help, into personal attacks and flames. Which of course distracts people from the real issue. </P><P>It's too bad one of the most senior necros in EQ couldn't get behind the other isssues posted and move them along instead of nit-picking on two minor issues. Instead, right after you said.. i am all for supporting issues to further our cause as necros.. you then pick 2 minor issues nit-pick over, thereby damaging the entire previous post.</P><P>We don't need to take a survey of different segments of the necro community, we are talking only about ARCH and CLASS AA skills. VI reads this board. So take a leadership role and contribute to the thread concept please.</P><P>Obviously, you are a stickler for details, you have a vast amount of exp in game as a necro, as well as good marketing ideas. Why don't you take the lead organizing the community and lets move forward with this concept and make our lives easier. If I can be of any help I would be happy to contribute if requested or needed.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         I only have one complaint about AA to be honest.</P><P>Lifeburn: it does not crit, and there is no modifier.</P><P>When a wizard casts mana burn....he can do 1.5-1.75x(not sure on the second number) his total mana pool.  This leads to DD nukes of 9-10k on a well equipped Wizard.  The best equipped necro in the game can do what...6k, the average necro...about 4k?  THere is not modifier to balance out the ability.</P><P>The fact lifeburn cannot crit is utterly stupid.  Wizards crit for 20k, and post SS's.  There should be some random chance of a crit, imo.  </P><P>As for the rest of the AA abilities, Mastery is amazing for 2 classes imo...wizard and Necro (Clr/shm too but they aren't a comparison really).  We use pure alteration, they use pure evocation.  This ability is much better for us than enchanters.</P><P>The junk class skills are cute, but semi useless.  Look at other classes before you get too mad.  Rogues took it in the ass.  Bards didn't get too much either.  Rangers/Paladins/SK/Wiz really got some bad ass AA, other than that, it's all kinda iffy, but we'll get more time wasting AA once PoP comes out i'm sure.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         Mend Companion is pointless when using a summoned pet.  But, when used in conjunction with a dire pet that has 5k+ hit points, the value of this skill becomes more apparent.</P><P>Pet Hold Skill is VERY useful for pulling mobs, especially caster mobs, from long distances where you have to run back to where your pet is parked.  This skill is pretty much invaluable when soloing indoors with a pet.  Yeah the pet not attacking mezzed mobs change may seem like it devalues this skill, but in reality it does not.  The change made recently to pets regarding mezzed mobs actually makes your pet more valuable, and does not degrade any of our skills.</P><P>Life Burn is a great skill.  Smaller guilds can make tremendous use of 4k unresistable damage to mobs like Kunark dragons and Epic mobs.  Granted, for larger and more powerful guilds, this skill becomes less useful.. mobs with 150k+ hit points don't really drop any faster if a few necros are Life Burning it.  Yes, it should be able to crit.. this is the flaw in the Life Burn skill.  As a side note on Life Burn, by using a self rune and harmshield you can avoid any unwanted attention from a mob after you Burn it.</P><P>And as Sally mentioned, there are a lot of places and situations where either AE undead mez -or- AE fear would be incredibly useful.  However, the actual cast time of these skills makes them not so useful in a situation where you might be using these skills to their full potential.</P><P>As for Arch skills, i would put points into Expertise before Channeling.  Never fizzling FD and Harmshield is UBER and will save your LIFE.  As it is, i channel very well against most anything that i would expect to stand up to for more than several seconds. Sure it would be nice to channel a little more, and maybe its just me, but fizzles really piss me off.</P><P>Oh, and i don't really think Mental Clarity is that useful to us. I do like your idea for added hit point regen though, would be nice to have that as an option instead of MC.</P><P>Other than the above points, i mostly agree with what you are saying.  But, like Sally said: For VI to take it seriously, it has to be PERFECT and make sense to, and be endorsed by, the majority of us Necros.  Don't take our criticism as flaming. </P><P>Vtyn<BR>Warlock<BR>Heaven and Earth</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         Ok imho... im lvl 57 so plz keep flames to a minimum this is just how i see it..... pet control is actually useful if you have ever soloed in lguk or someplace at lvl 53 and tried single pulling a caster only to have your pet go running in aggro 12 mobs and then have FD screw up and you become a corpse ~no this is not a rare instance if you have spent much time soloing indoors anyplace with casters, so dont try and say its a rare thing that only happens to me~ pet control would be very helpful, mend companion... granted it isnt that great... i personally have found a place or 2 where it could be used though even with a summoned pet not charmed pet... one example is when ive been oom and had 6-18 greener mobs beating on my pet in droga or Lguk and pet dies... with mend companion i would be able to keep pet alive long enough to med up and finish the job... though it would be nice if it was a pet resist buff or a better haste or something instead it would be nicer... AE undead mez.... i dunno... maybe in HS... but i havent had a chance to use it test resists or anything so i cant really say much... AE fear has some serious usefulness in arena fights ~ever try taking on 3 lvl 53s at once?~ but yeah some of it is useful... i really think we need Arch fixed though.. that is very bad how that is lol even something like improved durability would be better hehehe....... well cya later im gonna go sit LFG for another 5 hours cause soloing      in a zone nobody uses on my server at 4am when nobody i know is on is really damned boring</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         The main problem with a lot of the AA abilities are that the reuse timer on them is soooo long. I mean, AE fear and AE mez would ONLY be used for extreme emergencies because it takes 72min til you can reuse them. AE fear would be something i would use for fun, because if i were to use it when hunting, it could cause a ton of trouble if i wasnt very careful. AE fear would be good in arena fights? I'm not exactly sure how low of a resistance it has, but anyone over lvl 50 is very damn fear resistant. AE mez would only be used if i was getting beat on by a ton of mobs, and was about to die. otherwise, ther is no use to have it cause it takes too long to reuse.</P><P>Mend companion is nice, but its takes too long to recast it. I personally do not want to spend valuable AAexp points on an ability that takes 2 hours and 24min to recast. Pet hold is a fricken joke. Sure its a nice ability, but why on earth do we have to wait til lvl 59 to get it? I have better things to spend aaexp points on then pet hold, esp stuff like dire charm, lifeburn, Innate Invisibility to Undead and call to corpse. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=2 face="Verdana" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote> pet control is actually useful if you have ever soloed in lguk or someplace at lvl 53 and tried single pulling a caster only to have your pet go running in aggro 12 mobs and then have FD screw up and you become a corpse <hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana" size=2 id=quote><BR>Sure, pet hold would be awesome at LEVEL 53, but what happens when you are lvl 60 and get this ability?

         I took some of the post I made in general and posted it here since I think it applies.  Essentially, I think VI needs to take a second look at our AA abilities.</P><P>For existing abilities:<BR>- Mend companion: this skill needs a faster refresh rate. 2+ hours is just ludicrous for complete heal on a pet. I'd say lower this to 30 minutes, or at least have the option of lowering the recast time by putting multiple levels (3/6/9) on this skill; not unbalancing at all and would make this skill remotely worth having.<BR>- Lifeburn: I really think VI went overboard when they designed the limitations/drawbacks for this ability, especially when compared to manaburn. I don't want to get into a comparison or turn it into a wizards vs. necro bitch, but manaburn has ways in which its limitation (leaving the wizard with no mana) can easily be negated (mod rods for one). The fact that the necro is dropped to 1 health has a twofold effect of leaving the necro vulnerable to easy death to to AE and such along with insta super agro. There really is no way to overcome this either, as even having manaskin doesn't avoid the low health agro problems.  Against any boss mob raid, manaskin or rune won't even come close to saving you; when I've died to this, there isn't even enough time to toss up harmshield.<BR>- Dead Mesmerization: Fix this broken ability already! I recall a raid in Akheva where a bad pull could have been brought under control had this skill actually worked as advertised. I can't believe this has gotten such a low priority that its still broken.<BR>- Mass Group Buff: I think its a bit silly that it costs 9 AA points to MGB the one group spell necros have which also happens to be a nonpurchaseable, rare spell.</P><P>Suggestions/additions:<BR>- As 'masters of the undead', I believe necs got a raw deal in that we have no AA skills to enhance our offensive abilities (nukes, etc) vs. the undead. Paladins have Slay Undead which allows them to do disgusting crits to undead (I frequently see 3k-4k hits on undead mobs by guild paladins with this skill). What about a similar ability for us when we use our undead nukes?</P><P>The entire concept of necros becoming liches was something that could have been tapped into with AA abilities. How about a skill which allows the necro to assume lich form with either limitless or near limitless duration which remains while zoning? This lich form could have the bonus of being stackable with clarity perhaps.</P><P>Some spells we have allow us to control our bodies in certain ways. example; that we don't need to breathe (breath of the dead). I see potential for an AA skill there. </P><P>I think there is enormous roleplaying potential with AA abilities which is completely going to waste for us. When I look at the excitement some other classes have over their AA skills, I get a bit depressed to think that spell casting mastery 3 and innate invis undead is about the best it gets for us.  We need more AA abilities that expand upon spells and skills we already have, not fluf abilities which are conveniences at best.</P><P>=-=-=-=-=-=-=<BR>Aildrik T'Quetzl<BR>"The more fear you make, the more loot you take"<BR>- Lex Luthar, Superman IV<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         Its all very simple.</P><P>Verant hates you.</P><P>I mean Shammys get uber canni as an AAexp ability.<BR>Shadowknights and Pallys get uber horses.<BR>Necromancers get insta-death (Themselves), and make bones from meat.</P><P>Okay let me get vicious on that..<BR>If a zone has things that are still droping 'meat' it has skellys in it.</P><P>Good necromancers never run out of bonechips. Period.<BR>If it means that much to you, get that dagger that procs them.</P><P><BR>I can think of dozens of good (bad lol) aaexp abilitys.</P><P>Lets get those brainstormss going!</P><P>Class ones especially.<BR>Grim Reaper. (9) <BR>See invis, Ultravison, Spectre Form, With speed increase. (with cool particle effects). Meleeing causes random lifetaps. Insta-cast form that stays with zoning. Makes your fear proof. Permanent duration. (you are a grim reaper lol)</P><P>Lord of Suffering 3/6/9/15<BR>Raises the damage on all dots by 2, 3, 5 and 7% respectively. This is permanant not a crit.</P><P>Aura of the Cursed (1/15).<BR>Makes your weapon insta-kill anything Under 5 or 35. (Even 20 this would be a cool abily if it had a neat emote) Anything that TOUCHES you that is under 5 or 35 is killed instantly. (damn greenies) Leaves a corpse because corpses are cool.</P><P>Summon: Scythe of the damned (5)<BR>A neat weapon to give your pet that raises his damage. Works for any pet. and it looks uber. Partice effects with blood and etc. Can be used by the creator too. Has neat stats on it.</P><P>Undead Mastery (9)<BR>Pet Haste and STR (recasting stuff is a pain so its permanant:)</P><P>Last Stand (15) (kind of seems overpowering but its a neat idea)<BR>Does 4x your hitpoints in damage that is unresistable. Leaves a DoT that does 1.5x your manapool in damage. Debuffs STR, DEX, AGI, STA and AC But you die casting it. Used on a 56 and under it kills the target(lifeburn is a death sentence anyway lol)</P><P>Super dooper Lich. (5)<BR>Upgrade to Arch Lich.</P><P>Link of Vitality (9)<BR>Your pet lifetaps and you get the health. Regular attacks tranfer health also. (HA now you have a reason to raise a pet :)</P><P>Refined Lifetap (3/5/7)<BR>Raises the damage of lifetaps by 3,5 and 10% Raises their mana cost by  1.5, 2.5, and 5% respectively.</P><P>Enduring Curse (3/5/7)<BR>Makes Lifetaps over time last longer by 1 ,3 and 6 ticks.</P><P>Torture (20)<BR>Must have full mana to use. Recycle timmer is 288. This brings your mana to 0 and makes you unable to use a lich type spell for the duration of spell. This does 30k in damage over 96 seconds. (basically a wizard casting his 2100 dd every 7 seconds, but its a dot so it should be better :) It stacks with other necromancers. Yes its effected by Lord of Suffering :) <BR>2100/7 = 300 <BR>96 x 300 = 28000</P><P>WTF doesn't my darkness stick first time (1/3/5)<BR>Makes darkness stick on stuff under 30, 50, and 59 (except stuff it should not stick on stuff) Everytime.. damn I hate resists.</P><P>Clarity NOW (1)<BR>Dumps all the mana you have onto someone else at a ratio of 1 to 1.5. (I bet they implement this one) Reuse timmer is 30 seconds :)</P><P>Silent Slumber. (2)<BR>Improved Feign Death. 1 second.</P><P>Cover of Night. (4)<BR>Group Invisibly vs Undead. 30 seconds.</P><P>Eternal Fear (5) <BR>Fear that lasts same duration as Darkness. 30 seconds reuse.</P><P>Spectre Pet Heaven (4)<BR>Makes all pets summoned look like spectres! Can be turned on and off.</P><P>Eternal Laziness (3)<BR>Pet loots for you. Coin only</P><P>Ignore resistance (5/15/20)<BR>Assuming the spell WOULD HAVE BEEN resisted.<BR>5 - Makes lifetaps do half damage.<BR>10 - Makes lifetaps 3/4 damage and DoTs Half.<BR>20 - Makes Lifetap comepletely unresistable, DoTs do 3/4.</P><P>Empathy for the Living. (5)<BR>Makes any lifetap essentially a group tap. So DD taps are instant heals, and taps over times are essentialy Zeefers. &lt;on/off&gt;</P><P>Empathy for the Wise (10)<BR>Gives mana created from lich form to group, like a bard song. stack with everything. &lt;on/off&gt;</P><P>I'll stop there for now, The list is endless. Think up some of your own.</P><P>As always feedback is appreciated. Feel free to submit these to verant if you feel you would like it added to your current ability set.</P><P>Tyler</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         Well, that was a long list there and some of them sounded good. there are two abilities I'd like to see, alot. </P><P>First- Lich upgrade or something. Cool Luclin graphic, preferably with the face reflecting your own. Make it to the max duration, 12 hours or whatevert, with some bonuses and on/off for a kind of small amount but efficient lich. AND, make it stack with with spells that have an illusion, but don't show the illusion (i.e. liching), except for horses, give it a horse model!</P><P>Second- The ability to ride a horse on arch lich! If lich isn't a class defining ability I don't know what is, I'd like to see some focus on it, like maybe being able to use a horse on the ultimate lich! No other class has an ultimate ability ruin something so beneficial.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         woot I gotta comment on this stuff. other than Tyler, some of that was friggin funny if ya think about some of them =)</P><P>but ehre are soem of the abilities I'd like to see / suggestions on them.</P><P>Summon: Scythe of the damned (5)<BR>A neat weapon to give your pet that raises his damage. Works for any pet. and it looks uber. Partice effects with blood and etc. Can be used by the creator too. Has neat stats on it.</P><P>Not sure about having stats on it. But it'd be nice summon a weapon just for looks on our pets, but you could also summon it and give to a lowbie just so he can have an uber lookin pet too and make him feel special =P</P><P>Undead Mastery (9)<BR>Pet Haste and STR (recasting stuff is a pain so its permanant:)</P><P>Now this I would love to see. a high str and haste increase for the pet. TO balance it just slightly you may have a slight decrease in the pets AC. From an RP point of view if you're swinging rally rally fast and hard you're not really paying attention to defending.. plus a pet has no brain in wich to think with =P</P><P>Silent Slumber. (2)<BR>Improved Feign Death. 1 second.</P><P>Another good one. SK's get a spell at lvl 59?60? that is like this. We should too </P><P>Disdain for the Dead (1/3/5)<BR>This raises the damage on all Vs undead spells by 5, 10, 25%. Lowers resists by 10, 25 and 75%.</P><P>Don't know why VI didn't give this to us already, maybe with PoP &lt;hopes&gt;. But I'd still like to see it, mainly cuz I think our undead nukes should be similar to damage to wizzy nukes that they can use on anything.</P><P>Imbue weapon (10)<BR>Makes any spell you have half as effective but capable of procing on someone elses weapon for 15 minutes. Reuse is 45minutes. Spell costs triple mana usage.</P><P>lol now this can be very overpowering, but would be nice to see. maybe make it 15 AA , 4xmana, reuse 2 1/2 hours. mainly situational in boss fights, also limit it to cast on 50+ chars.... otherwise we necros would be the greatest PLers in the game, well better than what we are now if you knwo what you're doing</P><P>Bane of the Dead. (1/3/7)<BR>Imbues party memebers weapons with Dead bane damage. +1 +3 and +5 Respectively. Lasts 72 minutes. Recast is 72 minutes.</P><P>Another good one. make us more loveable in groups in undead areas. Make is duration 36 min keep recast timer.  Though I'd like us to have spells like this for lower levels... like Bane Undead 1 at lvl 12, Bane Undead 3 at lvl 24, Bane Undead 5 lvl 39. though the spells would be single target, not group like the ability would be, also spell and ability could not stack</P><P>Gift of the Mentor. (9)<BR>Can only be cast on player necromancers that are 20th level or under.<BR>Fizzles are lessened by 75% mana cost of spells are Halfed, mana and health regeration are doubled. Skeletal pet raised is 2 levels higher than normal, and can use the lifetap of that of the owner. Duration is 60 Minutes Recast time is 30. (like giving a wizzy KEI) </P><P>This one I also like, cuz I like to go back to newbie areas and help out fellow necromancers. Instead of 2 level higher pets.. make it like if they have that book that increases pet damage, forget what it's called=P. Bring fizzles to 60%. and pet cant use the taps..just for balance issues. Duration maybe upped to 75 minutes &lt;half of KEI&gt; recast down to 25 minutes.... dunno why just felt like bringing that down =P</P><P>THe other skills you listed could be done s well with a bit of work and nerfing / twinking.</P><P>Sicarius Althule<BR>Terris-Thule Server</P><P><BR>Death is but one sweet release....</P><P>Edited by - Merdakai on 07/24/2002  05:50:40<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         (Cuku, please ignore the Triton necros and their brown-nosing followers and continue to post here. They think the necromancer class is UBER and needs no help because that way they can come on these boards and brag about their gear and the latest YXZ mob they just killed. YAWN. They don't live in the same world as most of us and they would certainly hate for the rest of the necromancer class to get the upgrades the we legitimately deserve because then that would make them *less* uber. Notice too that he attacked your efforts to bring this issue to Verant's attention and offered no suggestions of his own. Typical Triton arrogance.)</P><P>As I've mentioned before low level clerics get AE fear spells yet Necromancers have to invest many AA exp points just to get the very same thing. Who would you think the Master of Fear is? A cleric or a necromancer? Verant would have you believe it's a cleric. This is just another example how we got the shaft on AA skills. The argument that most of them were made with the damage dealing caster ie. the wizard in mind is 100% dead on. There are no DOT AA skills and that is a joke for necromancers.</P><P><BR>Necromantic Pact</P><P>-I'd like to see an AA skill that uses our ability to summon the dead to be able to rez a player once "x" amount of game hours. Player who is rezed is in skeleton form until they gate or zone. Necromancer who uses this gets the resurection affects rather than the target player. After all we do "summon the dead" don't we?</P><P><BR>Pet Casting Mastery</P><P>-This AA skill would increase the chance of summoning a top hitter pet by 20%, 40%, 80% with each 2 points expended. Since our spectre pets cost 1 peridot = 11pp this can get rather expensive getting a top hitter pet nevermind a dark blue one.</P><P></P><P>Dornette<BR>60 necromancer<BR>The Nameless<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
