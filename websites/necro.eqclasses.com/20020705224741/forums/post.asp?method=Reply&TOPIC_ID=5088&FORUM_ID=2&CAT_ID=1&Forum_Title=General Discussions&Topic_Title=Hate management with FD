FD if successful removes a set amount of hate points from the hate list. This may or may not lower it enough from one successful FD to let you sit and med, depends on how much you have built vs. others engaging the mob. To try this, land a few dots on AoW, Cursed, etc. then try to sit. Now land a few dots, FD, stand up immediately then sit. The second time you will not get summoned.</P><P>2.) When you FD after aggroing a mob, if it hit you or you have landed spells on it it will usually hang around a sec before returning to what it was doing.</P><P>3.)When you FD after aggroing a mob, if it was a roamer you will always be on it's aggro list until it dies or you leave the zone (or camp or /q out).</P><P>4.) When a wanderer roams far enough that your proximity aggro is wiped you can sometimes get away with standing and running around. Your proximity aggro range with that mob however is now wider range than normal since you are on it's hate list.</P><P>5.) When you FD after aggroing a mob, if it is a static spawn or has "set rest points" on it's roaming path you will almost always be removed (95%) from the hate list and no longer have aggro after it returns and is standing for a few seconds.</P><P>6.) There are a few mobs that will always see through FD if you have done damage to them. The AoW and skelletons in the basement in Snake Temple in in The Grey (screw Verant eternally for timesinks) is a prime example of this. It doesn't matter if you have a pet up or not, they see you.</font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Sometimes mobs are just more likely to see through even a 'successful' FD. Go to the hole. The very entrance. The elementals there often see through a successful FD. They even may con indifferent to you while you're down, but they'll still attack you. I had theorized it had something to do with slow, or them coming off a stun, or any number of other things, so I tried it a few times and it basically comes down to this guess at a theory:</P><P>Mobs over a certain level, possibly of a specific type, in a specific zone, or flagged a certain way, have a (greater?) chance to see through feign. </P><P>Our feign, being a spell, is likely set at a certain number on the roll -- meaning we are arbitrarily assigned a skill value to use when calculating 'success' or 'failure'. A critical failure means we get the 'falls down' message. However, a less critical failure may result in certain mobs being able to see through it. Monks, as they have an actual FD skill and likely do not have an arbitrary value (such as 100, perhaps, or some value based on our skill in that type of magic or our level) at higher levels have a far greater chance of successfully feigning (beyond just 'falls down'). I have noticed that my monk roommate nearly never has a mob see through feign once she's down (such as in the hole, where she commonly fights, sometimes with me), whereas I will have the problem consistantly in certain zones, against certain mobs. The vampire bats in ME tend to see through her feign, as well, leading me to believe that there is more to it than level and skill alone. This isn't due to AoE's hitting, spells landing, etc.</P><P>Added on top of this is how exactly the 'hate list' wiping actually works. I would wager that it reduces hate an amount based on the roll. Alternatively it could simply have a base chance to wipe the hate list, or a base chance to reduces hate a specific amount. Thus, you could have a 50% chance to do say, 500 points of hate reduction. Or you could have a 50% chance to completely wipe yourself from a particular mob's hate list, and so forth. However it works, repeatedly feigning does work, as either you reduce your hate enough, or you simply finally make a 'hate wipe' roll on that mob. Sometimes multiple feigns won't work to clear even a monk from the hate list even when the monk did only a few points of damage. This lends credibility to the theory that the hate list reduction, even on a successful feign is either a) variable, sometimes not being enough to remove even a few points of hate, or b) fixed, but having a chance to be or not be applied, or c) a combination of both or some alternative method.</P><P>I haven't read over monk boards about this topic, but I would wager that they have far more in depth discussions and thoughts on the matter and it would prove useful to possibly inquire as to such there.</P><P>I heartily suggest that any of you willing to take the time to do some testing try this out. Specifically the hole and ME I can vouch for mobs often seeing through my feign, but also umbral plains, and sometimes sirens grotto as well. I don't often have this problem in lower level zones or against lower level mobs (take your pick as to which it would be -- I would guess the mob is what matters, but it could be that a zone has an inherent modifier versus feign, as well).</P><P>It certainly isn't something that's 100%. For instance, the spectres in the hole almost never saw through my feign, the rock golems did periodically and the elementals commonly. This is based on impressions, so is hardly useful statistical data. I may go back and track how many times it works or such in the future for certain mob types. Who knows.</P><P> </font></td>

Hate is a funny thing, and certain mobs hate certain spells more.  To me, playing the Necro is all about rythms.  I don't keep timers, but rarely let a snare wear off.

This also varies from zone to zone with some mobs hating some spells more than other mobs. In my experience Envenomed Bolt is generally one of the most hated spells around but I personally seldom use it as it is not mana efficient and just doesn't generate the kind of damage needed for high end mobs. (2 EB = 1 pyro but costs more than 50% extra mana and generates WAY more hate than Pyro).</P><P> </font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Nope, I'm not being rooted. Most of these mobs don't rampage, or anything like that. I can be in melee range or out. They can be slowed or not slowed. I can have done 4k in damage or just a tap if it's early in the fight. I can have dots running or have none. I'm not standing up and being hit, I'm staying down, and still being hit. There is no failure message, for either me or my group. This isn't a one time occurance that I may have missed in spam, this is a behavior that I have experienced time and time again. Hell, if rooted, they'll beat on a melee, then when root breaks they'll come over and hit me while I'm still feigned (with no falls down message).</P><P>The only reason being in melee range matters for the purposes of this is that they'll be more likely to hit me if I'm close -- and they're hitting me, of course, else I wouldn't notice it. The rock golems I mentioned, for instance are usually ST'd or rooted by me for crowd control. I feign to try to make them go for a tank when they break the root or mez, but even on a success, the mob still comes for me. I'm never within melee range for that. I'm usually about half casting range  or so to give the melee a chance to hold aggro. And no, it doesn't only happen when a mob comes off mez (which was also something I thought about -- ie: the mob holding a target while mezzed where it normally would have had to give it up), so that's out too.</P><P>As I said, go to the hole or the bats in ME, take a few friends. Try it. Try it solo. Try it grouped. Try it with a pet. Try it without. If it never happens to you, then make the best of it: You'll never have a problem surviving anything. But I and the friends I group with daily are well aware that it can, and does, happen. We just call that the mobs (or mob type -- as I said before, not all mobs in a certain zone share the capability) see through feign as soon as it happens and I stay in low aggro mode for the rest of the fighting there or against those mobs.</P><P>Some necros have experienced this, some haven't. It could be that it doesn't happen when solo as often, it could be that it is a bug. It could be completely intentional. It could be many things -- lord knows feign has had problems before (ask any monk, they'll tell you about entire months when things would just see through feign for no reason -- check the patch archives on castersrealm for the resolutions to same). It may be that it is a bug in the hate list or target selection code that allows you to remain a target for the mob when you shouldn't normally be.</P><P>It would be interesting to have a poll to see what percentage of necromancers (or SKs, or even monks) have experienced this. I think I'll go peruse the monk boards.</P><P><BR> </font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> But one of the pages commenting on FD on monkly-business.</P><P><a href="http://monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=164" target="_blank">http://monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=164</a></P><P>To quote a few relevant portions:</P><P>Q: Are there any known bugs in Feign Death?</P><P>A: There are a few known bugs, all of which are notorious for being hard to repeat and hard to fix. Sometimes, when using the first person view, attempting to immediately stand up after feigning will cause you to be unable to move. Sitting, then standing again will clear this, but be very careful because even green mobs will aggro on you if you sit. When pulling higher-level creatures I would recommend using a third-person view anyway, so practice using both the view and the skills early. There is also a very annoying bug which causes FD to fail with no messages sometimes when there are multiple characters on a mob's aggro list(almost all the time during grouping/raiding). This is still being researched by Verant staff, and they seem to have reduced its occurrence (though it's not been totally fixed yet). </P><P>Also of note:</P><P>Q: What breaks a successful Feign?</P><P>A: Two things will break a sucessful feign: (1) getting hit by any spell except a dispell, beneficial or harmful, including AEs, and (2) moving. There are lots of things that could make you move while FD -- steep slopes, accidentally right-clicking on a corpse (and thereby looting it) when you're trying to con a mob, or finishing a bandage all count as movement.</P><P>And yet another (the edit):</P><P>Q: What's the FD bug, and what can I do to fix it?</P><P>A: "The FD bug" that people refer to is the one where you hit the FD key, fall over, don't get any of the various failure messages, but you still get beaten on like a madman. Some things you can do to fix it --</P><P>1. Make sure that autoattack is off when you hit FD. Make sure autoattack has been off long enough to catch up to your lag; that means waiting at least 3 seconds, if you're on a dialup or under raid lag.</P><P>2. Move around a bit before you FD (unless you habitually get the "you have moved and are no longer feigning death" message). Most people jump back.</P><P>3. Make sure that the failure wasn't caused by something more mundane, like a message you missed due to spam or lag.</P><P>Also, guides usually don't give rezzes for deaths due to "The FD Bug", since it's not a recognized one. Also, VI's said that they've tried to fix this one, and its occurrence has been greatly reduced since they've said it.</P><P>Edited by - mordrakken on 06/18/2002  17:22:17</font></td>
