                       *Lifebane wanders the streets of Freeport looking for a particular individual, or type of                       individual that is. He eyes a rather hagard looking human walking down the street                       towards the residential section of town. Lifebane follows the rivvil male to a small home,                       then watches as the man begins to unlock the door.. Lifebane quickly gathers shadows                       about him and quietly follows the rivvil into his home without notice. Lifebane watches
      as                       the rivvil man greets his breeder and the 2 vile offspring which must be his own. Lifebane                       notes the weakness of affection which the rivvil has for his kin then nods approvingly as                       a cruel smile crosses his lips and he whispers quietly to himself: "this one will do..."                       Lifebane stands vigil near the door and waits for the next dawn, the rivvil begin to stir a                       bit... and the man rivvil gathers his belongings to leave his home... Lifebane grins evilly                       and prepares to leave as well. As the man rivvil leaves his home, Lifebane still hidden                       within shadows stalks out after him. The man rivvil wanders off towards his place of                       employment, turning down alleys and streets as he would any other day.. But this time,                       the fates have a surprise in store for the unsuspecting rivvil. As the rivvil turns down an                       alley, he fails to note it being a bit darker then normal, perhaps a bit more shadowy then                       expected for this time of the morn. The man rivvil gets halfway down the alley before his                       feet are suddenly rooted to the ground, he gasps in shock then coughs a bit as he is                       engulfed in a disease cloud of great intensity, boils and black splotches appearing almost                       instantly upon the man rivvil's flesh. Pain forcing the man to his knees as he feels his                       innards rotting away at an incredibly fast rate. The man rivvil gasps weakly once more as                       he feels his life force waning, but is shocked to feel the pain cease to grow... a moments                       reprieve to his torment... he weakly looks around to try to understand what has just
      happened... his eyes widen as he notes a dark skinned figure stepping out of the                       shadows, eyes glowing red like hot coals and a cruel smirk stretched across the evil face.                       A dark elf approaches the man rivvil and kneels down next to him, all the while                       maintaining eye contact.. seemingly feeding off of the pain and fear seen within the                       man's eyes. The dark one then speaks....*<br>
      <br>
                       Vendui rivvil. Dos will nau perish for now... though usstan quite certain that dos wounds                       are quite painful. Death must certainly be welcome at this time, nau? But that is nau dos                       fate rivvil vermin. Dos must perform a service for usstann. Xas, a service. Dos will
      go to a                       group of rivvil and their weak allies and present a message. Nau look defiant little rivvil,                       dos has a nice little home.. 2 little ones and a breeder as well.. Would be a shame to see                       them suffer the same plagued fate as dos... dos nau would like that usstann thinks. So                       here is what dos must do little rivvil....<br>
      <br>
                       *Lifebane leans a bit closer and quietly explains what the rivvil must do and the look on                       the rivvil's face showing more and more despair with each passing moment. After a few                       moments Lifebane steps away from the rivvil and chuckles evilly.*<br>
      <br>
                       Dos now know what dos must do little rivvil. Go now, but first... hmmm...&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                       *Lifebane casts a spell and draws the disease from the rivvil into himself, curing the rivvil                       of his ailments and wounds while inflicting them upon himself... a cackle of pleasure and                       pain is heard from the dark ones throat. Lifebane then casts another enchantment and                       cures his illness... never once removing his gaze from the rivvil and enjoying the look of                       amazement within the eyes of the rivvil servant. Lifebane looks quickly around the alley                       and sees what he seeks. Lifebane casts once again and drains the lifeforce from a                       passed out drunkark sleeping in the garbage.... the dirty man's flesh shrivels up and                       cracks as the dark elf's wounds disappear completely and a renewed look of vigor and                       power surrounds the dark elf. Lifebane smiles evilly at the unbelieving rivvil man*<br>
      <br>
                       Go now... do what dos has been told. Usstann will watch over dos family little rivvil. Nau                       plague shall touch their flesh so long as dos serves usstann in this manner.<br>
      <br>
                       *Lifebane watches as the rivvil wanders off to do his task. A cruel chuckle escapes his lips                       as he thinks to himself: "There are worse things then Disease little rivvil.. dos shall see*<br>
      <br>
                       ---- another place, some time later that day.........&nbsp;<br>
                       *The Guildmates that serve the banner of Stormwatch converse over things to do in the                       future, plan for conquering of the great beasts of the lands, and they boast of their great                       prowess. They barely notice a poorly dressed individual walking through their ranks and                       heading towards their gathering's center. The stranger finally reaches the center of the                       gathered mass and then begins to speak loudly:*<br>
      <br>
                       Great and powerful masters of the Clan known as Stormwatch, I have come hither this                       day to address thee all. Tis a sad thing which I have come hither to speak of. The good                       and just followers of stormwatch, those which worship the powerful Brel, the mighty                       Karanas, even the one called Marr... all of thee have the watchful eyes of the gods above                       upon thee. Yet lo there be found a stain in the ranks of purity, a smudge on the fabric of                       goodness. The gods have spoken to this poor soul, lo they have opened these eyes to                       the dangers of mingling with the evil races of the land, those that linger in shadow, the                       beasts which inhabit the swamps and worship the heathen gods. Brel has spoken to this                       one, has shown that the pureness of the power that thee doth hold within your grasp, it                       is tainted by the presence of evil!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                       *The man pauses to see the startled looks upon the gathered faces. Then continues to                       speak*<br>
      <br>
                       Within your ranks can be found evil scaled man-lizards, dark skinned heathen elven                       worshippers of foul Innoruuk, and a monstrous beast troll or ogre as well. Ye all must                       know of their foul deeds, and of their unfaultering oaths of evil. The beasts will ravage                       this gathering of good from within! Brel has shown this one the way, the evil must be                       expelled from your ranks, exorcise the blasphemers so that the "Watch" will be once                       again Pure. For it has been said, to partner with evil is to be evil. Judge one by their                       company, and when company is most foul, then one must be seen as such also. I ask all                       of thee, cast off these chains of deceit which the evil ones have cast upon thee. Rise up                       and spit in the face of the evil doers hidden within the ranks of the chosen. Do this, or                       suffer the daggers of traitorous hands later. Brel has spoken to this one, this is what this                       mind has understood. I have warned thee all of the vision, be mindful.<br>
      <br>
                       *with that closing statement, the man runs off with tears streaking down his face. He                       quickly disappears running down the roads leading off to freeport, leaving behind the                       Minions of Stromwatch with confused looks upon their faces.*<br>
      <br>
                       --- Some time later, back in the alleys of Freeport.<br>
                       *The man rivvil returns to the dark alley just after Dusk.... The darkness not frightening                       the man any longer, he now knows that there are worse things then being scared of the                       dark. Things much worse. As if on que, the man notices a pair of red glowing eyes                       watching him from the darkness. The man gasps for breathe after his panic filled return                       home. He gathers his strength and then speaks to the dark one*<br>
      <br>
                       I have done as ye asked evil one, the message is given, yer trickery and deceit have                       been planted as requested. Now my family, if ye be a beast of your word then they were                       spared the plague, I did as requested by thee evil one. Are they safe!?!!<br>
      <br>
                       *Lifebane slowly steps out of the shadows and into the dimly lit portion of the alley. The                       same cruel smile upon his face as when the man rivvil had left him earlier*<br>
      <br>
                       Vendui again little rivvil. Dos did well, usstan's Spies tell usstann that dos performed                       admirably for a rivvil. Let udos see what shall come of this deception. Oh xas, the love of                       ones kin, a terrible weakness little rivvil one dos must learn to overcome in this life, or                       perhaps the next one.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                       *Lifebane chuckles as if to a joke only he understood had just been made*<br>
      <br>
                       Come litle rivvil, lets be off to see dos kin.. usstann did nau lie rivvil.. they were spared                       the plague. Dos kept dos bargain, usstan kept his.<br>
      <br>
                       *With that said, Lifebane turns and begins to walk off towards the man rivvil's home, the                       rivvil sprinting off ahead of him as best he can in his weakened state. The man rivvil                       arrives at the door to his home a short moment before Lifebane does. He fumbles with                       the lock on the door and then shoves the door open desperately trying to get inside. He                       is immediately assaulted by the smell of excrement and death, he tries in vain to                       suppress his urges, but succumbs to a fit of vomiting. He drops to his knees and vomits                       uncontrollably for a moment. He begins to regain his composure and look around
      his                       home. He still reels from his sickened state but manages to hear the approaching                       bootseps of Lifebane behind him and the sound of skittering and scratching from                       nearby.*<br>
      <br>
                       Dos nau care for the aroma? Usstann finds it quite refreshing... the smell of flowers and                       perfume before was quite sickening. Oh, dos feel better now rivvil? GO on... dos family                       awaits dos. Usstann has them locked up in the bedroom chamber.<br>
      <br>
                       *The man rivvil stands again, knees a bit wobbly under him, he then goes to the                       bedroom door and tries to open it... he feels the door locked or perhaps blocked. He                       shoves harder and feels the door give a bit... he gathers his strength for one last shove                       and shoves hard... the doors blockage giving way so the door swings open. The man                       rivvil loses his balance from the exertion and falls inside onto the floor Lifebane begins to                       cast a spell and the rivvil turns quickly to see what is happening. He turns in time to see                       a green nimbus of eldrith fire leap from Lifebane's hands and surround his own body....                       the envenomed bolt beginning to burn at every nerve in his body immediately.... The
      pain                       is almost unbearable and the man rivvil begins to lose consciousness as his life dwindles                       away with the powerful poison in his system. Lifebane kneels down and grabs the man's                       face with a black gloved hand, he turns the man rivvil's face slowly around to view the                       room. The man rivvil gasps and chokes with pain as he feels his impending death                       approach. His eyes widen in terror as he takes in what he sees.*<br>
      <br>
                       There is dos breeder rivvil, and there dos two children, though usstann must say dos was                       a bit rough with the one behind the door... dos may have broken a bone or three with                       that shove. Oh, the rats were nau usstanns idea, dos shoudl build a better home
      next                       time... perhaps the vermin will nau gain so easy access again. Aluve rivvvil, dos has                       served dos purpose. Give usstann's regards to Innoruuk.<br>
      <br>
                       *Lifebane then let's go of the Man's terror filled face and the man's head drops loudly                       onto the wooden plank below. The man's face grimaces as the he sees the images within                       this room spiralling around within his mind, his family all dead. His wife strewn upon the                       bed, back arched as if in great pain, the sheets soiled by her lack of bodily control, her                       face bloated and tinged a shade of green. His son and his daughter, both strewn upon                       the floorboards, soiled, bloated, green as well. Both frozen in death with pained looks                       upon their faces. Rats scurry over all the corpses picking at them as if a grand feast. The                       man rivvil Sobs weakly as more tears cross his face, and he feels his remaining strength                       fading, his last thought being: "evil demon kept it's word, all were spared the plague...                       but not the poison" The man sobs a few times loudly as his body convulses into an
      almost inhuman position then with a final shudder, the man lets out one long last                       breathe of air... then the room is silent except for the feasting rats and the chuckling
      dark                       elf nearby*<br>
      <br>
                       It is always such a pleasure to destroy a rivvil utterly, both mind and soul, before one                       elggs them dead. Innoruuk does so like the suffering. Aluve to dos all vermin rivvil, and                       good eating little rodents.<br>
      <br>
                       *With that said, Lifebane gathers his magical powers around him once more to take him                       someplace far from there, someplace where he will wait for news of any fruits of this little                       venture.*
