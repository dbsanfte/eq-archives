        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">May 30th, 1:00 am<BR>------------------------------</P><P>*** Fan Faire ***</P><P><BR>The new EverQuest expansion, Shadows of Luclin, will be displayed <BR>and demonstrated at the Minneapolis Fan Faire! Don't miss this chance <BR>to see the latest and greatest upcoming features in the world of <BR>Norrath!</P><P>Registration for the event closes on June 4! Hurry and reserve your spot! <BR>Visit <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/" target="_blank">http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/</a> to register or for <BR>more information!</P><P></P><P>*** Message about our Guide Program ***</P><P><BR>Hail citizens of Norrath!</P><P>Hear my words, for I bring news of great importance.</P><P>Today I present to you an adventure, perhaps the greatest the Lands <BR>of Norrath have ever offered.  It is a quest of great proportions, and <BR>a journey fraught with danger.  Fear not though my friends, for the <BR>spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.</P><P>As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect <BR>and serve the lands of Norrath.  Scribes are lining up even now so that <BR>they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.</P><P>We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with <BR>compassion, and filled with joy.</P><P>If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, <BR>or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly <BR>the adventure for you.  Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could <BR>bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens.  Maybe your renowned <BR>acting skills might be of help.  If you are kind, compassionate, and <BR>helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.</P><P>If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be <BR>difficult at times.  You can be assured that you will be tried...  <BR>and hopefully you will be found true.  In the end though, the citizens <BR>of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the <BR>lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.</P><P>If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite <BR>you to point your browser to: <a href="http://guideapp.everquest.com" target="_blank">http://guideapp.everquest.com</a></P><P>We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to <BR>Norrath are grand.</P><P>A few things to remember:<BR>1) You must have an active EverQuest account in good standing.<BR>2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<BR>3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<BR>4) You will need good communication skills.<BR>5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<BR>6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.</P><P><BR>Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better <BR>than they already are... come be a part of the EverQuest Guide <BR>Program!</P><P> - The EverQuest Guide Program</P><P></P><P>*** Important Reminder ***</P><P>Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small <BR>chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will <BR>have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that <BR>they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one.  It is also <BR>important to understand that attempting to scam a GM about a lost <BR>corpse could mean banning from EverQuest.</P><P>** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM <BR>ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **</P><P>We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time.  <BR>In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a <BR>problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were <BR>unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in and check on it <BR>right away after the patch.</P><P>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned <BR>up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of <BR>corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of <BR>them disappearing.</P><P>Thanks.</P><P>- The EverQuest Team</P><P></P><P>*** Patch Message ***</P><P><BR>** Zone Changes **</P><P>- Runnyeye has been changed.  Something is up in Goblin land...</P><P><BR>** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **</P><P>- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code.  For the most <BR>part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to <BR>stack that were never intended to stack.</P><P>- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.</P><P>- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of <BR>Cazic Thule can scribe it.</P><P>- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been <BR>changed to be more appropriate.</P><P></P><P>** Features and Interface Changes **</P><P>- The variable %t will now work with /assist.  So you can use /assist %t <BR>if you wish.  Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist <BR>without the %t.</P><P>- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.</P><P>- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to <BR>user color 15 (same as other skill messages).  The success message <BR>was already set to user color 15.</P><P>- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does.  <BR>It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server.  The new <BR>ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list <BR>(<character name>_<#>.ini).  The first time a character is created or <BR>loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old <BR>ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.</P><P>- The Alt key now works in several new situations.  It will now show <BR>item names when in the trade window.  Because the trade items of the <BR>local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item <BR>names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player <BR>positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade <BR>window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade <BR>item names.</P><P>- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.</P><P>- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse <BR>items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.</P><P>- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when <BR>held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they <BR>don't show up otherwise).</P><P>- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any <BR>player that is on your /ignore list.  Some players were using this <BR>to annoy players that had ignored them.</P><P>- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are <BR>on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to <BR>annoy people that had ignored them).</P><P>- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the <BR>members of your guild in your zone.  You can also specify a guild name, <BR>such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".</P><P>- /safelock command added.  /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface <BR>(mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash <BR>commands) with the password that you supply to the command.  You must use <BR>this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the <BR>interface.  Passwords are NOT case-sensitive.  So to lock your interface, <BR>you would type /safelock password.  You would do the same to unlock it.  <BR>REMEMBER:  If you forget what password you typed, you will need to <BR>reboot your machine.</P><P><BR>** Item Changes **</P><P>- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now <BR>also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.</P><P>- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.</P><P>- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of <BR>your waist.</P><P>- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop.  <BR>They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. </P><P>- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable.  <BR>There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so <BR>we had to disable that for these items.</P><P>- Sewing Kits:  No existing sewing kits are being changed with this <BR>patch.  But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different.  <BR>Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots.  Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 <BR>slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.</P><P>- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty <BR>blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.</P><P><BR>**  Other Stuff **</P><P>- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level <BR>bard title.  :)</P><P>- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with <BR>that of his counterparts in Velious.  This is not the sort of thing <BR>that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that <BR>nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest.  We're <BR>announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.</P><P><BR>- The EverQuest Team</P><P><BR>Almas Bada$$<BR>Defiler of Ayonae Ro</font></td>
