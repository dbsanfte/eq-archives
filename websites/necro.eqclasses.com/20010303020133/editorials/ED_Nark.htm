              <font face="Tahoma" size="2">Okay, Well first of all I started out
              with a <font color="#AEC3DB">gnome Necromancer</font>. I wanted
              the ability to tinker. Second I also Wanted the ability to start
              out in Greater Faydark. It is the BEST hunting grounds for New
              players. A bit dangerous but everyone dies a lot when they are
              young so get over it, then get over to your corpse.</font>

              <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;
              <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">
              <font face="Tahoma" size="2">At level one you
              can get about one half of a bubble a kill with bats. <font color="#AEC3DB">decaying
              skeletons</font>, and <font color="#AEC3DB">giant wasps</font>.
              That will get you to level 2 in just under 30 minutes. (Some
              people say kill decaying skeletons but I would rather buy my bone
              chips. There are better ways to get cash like running the bard
              note from <font color="#AEC3DB">Ak'Anon to Kelethin</font> 5 gold a
              pop and since it is your hometown you will be running there Quite
              a bit until you can gate.) Second level you can either Stay on <font color="#AEC3DB">decaying
              skeletons</font> (for the bone chips) or you may move on to orc
              pawns. Remember! they hit hard so don't let your pet tank for too
              long. Under level 16 think of your pet as another DoT just
              whacking away at the monster's life. also Try to have a mage
              summon you a Dagger They are quite nice for the pets and I seem to
              think That pets hit more often with a weapon.</font>

              Level 2</font>! you are finally ridding the orcs of the world and
              Working on that god awful faction of yours. Go to the pile of
              stones and kill the wandering Orc pawns. They are a bit scarce but
              Worth the wait. in the mean time Cast a DoT on a wasp and let your
              pet kill it off while you stay Full mana.&nbsp; The orc pawns will
              get you to level 3 in no time. Here is where it stops getting
              easy. now you have <font color="#AEC3DB">2 choices</font>. you can
              go somewhere else that is less dangerous or you can follow what I
              say, but remember you die A LOT but you don't loose exp till 4th
              so don't sweat it.</font>

              <font face="Tahoma" size="2"> <font color="#AEC3DB">Level
              3!</font> Now you can go find wandering orc Centurions Their level
              Varies from 3 all the way to 16 or 17 (those are inside CrushBone)
              outside CB they will get all the way up to level 7. So you can go
              kill the wandering orc Centurions or you can prove how absolutely
              insane you are and go on over to the orc hill. (Its great<font color="#AEC3DB">
              Roleplaying </font>too! people Will be level 11 and 12 hunting at
              the hill and you will be a mere 3 necro bent on power.)&nbsp;
              okay, Don't go charging on in just yet friend. the orc hill
              usually has people on it. without it being camped this wont work.
              On the outskirts of the camp there are little orc Centurions that
              will con Yellow and even to you. Pick them off one at a time they
              will give you VERY nice Exp. do this until you have reached level
              5 or 6.</font>

              <font face="Tahoma" size="2"> <font color="#AEC3DB">Level
              6!</font> Well by now you have gate and a new round of DoT's some
              Much more powerful like one of my FAVORITE the darkness series. It
              doesn't do INSANE damage as some of your DoT's will but it slows
              target movement to a walk which is CRUCIAL to get out of those
              Sticky spots until you get to the zone. Now go to Butcher Block
              mountains. this is IDEAL hunting grounds. You will want to be
              killing <font color="#AEC3DB">Giant bats</font>, <font color="#AEC3DB">Giant
              snakes</font>, Etc... If you Really think you have the Feel of a
              necro you can Take on those Red Giant Scarabs. I took them on at 6
              and 7 and only died a few times when my spells were resisted more
              than 3 times. this will get you to level 8 in NO time!</font>

              they will be very very nice. your pet starts to dish out some Nice
              Damage, you get a pet heal which will save your Hide, and DARK
              PACT! my favorite series of spells. Changes Hp: Mana at an unknown

              got to 12. Okay Now it is time to Say goodbye to This New land and
              head over to North Ro! you should try to Solo dervs while people
              are grouping to kill them. This will get you to level 12 (If you
              find<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dervs too hard you </font> can go to easier

              Remember once again your pet cant tank too long. this is how you
              should fight these guys (as you should fight most anything in an
              open arena) darkness, (To slow to a walk) then Heat blood, Then
              you want to Fear right away your pet is almost dead by now.... if
              It resists the first fear get into the Melee and try to cast
              during combat. If you Cant fear Try to throw in a Poison bolt to
              Get your conjure level up. At level 14 or 13 you can Start killing
              Deep water <font color="#AEC3DB">Caimans</font>, if you can find
