				Startin off can be hard in EQ I know, I started with a monk and everyone knows that you can only carry up to 15 pounds.  So Ihad some trouble making the money.  I then later started a necro and that is where everything got better money wise.  I have decided to share my lvl's and what I as doing during these.<br><br>You are going to want to lvl in your newbie area for about the first 5 or 6 lvl's matters how twinked out you are.  After this you are going to want to move to Paludal Caverns.  This is where you first and only big money maker comes for awhile.  In here there are Muck's and Reshi's that you can fight until you are lvl 16 or so.  The Reshi's don't drop anything great unless you are fighting the big ones.  But the Muck's (only the burrowers and the diggers) drop a Pulsating Rock.  This can sell for around 50pp to players considering it is for the No Drop ring that everyone is dying to have.  I guess on a Blue server you guys probably won't get as much for it.  After you are done with all of those, you will kill fiends for a little while.  Until 18, they don't drop much but you have cure disease so the DoT that they throw on you won't last too long.  After all the lvling is done here comes you really nice lvling/farming spot especially for such a low level.  Now the bandit camps are always overcamped atleast on Rallos, and I know the same for Xegony.  But there is a spot in PC where rimy Owlbears are, in the back toward the newbie area.  It is a room of 4 of them and they are on about an 11 minute spawn time.  I am not exactly sure when you should leave this area but I think you can do them until lvl 22.  Now the owlbears drop a perfect owlbear hide which can sell for anywhere between 300 and 400pp if you play your cards right, this is because it is used to mkae rallic packs.  When I was doing this a Perfect pelt drop anywhere between 4 and 6 cycles of bears so if yo lvl there for abou 4 lvl's you should get about 6 pelts.  Which would get you some fine gear.  After you are done here you will need to do the bandits for a bit, up to lvl 26.  Try to get the loots off them with all the gear that they drop, sells for between  1-4pp.  But the main thing you are looking for is words.  At lvl 22 I headed back to my guild with all my unspent lvl points and got what I needed to get that I hadn't had before and then through all the rest into my research(Remember you do need to have money to make the points go apast 21).  Until lvl 26 I was just making money off of the spells I could make research,  The best ones for me were HarmShield and Haunting Corpse.  They can both sell for around 150pp on a blue server HarmShield will go a little higher on a red server though.  Now at lvl 26 you are going to move out to Marus Seru where you are going to fight greyhoppers until you get the hang of it and then stonegrabbers.  Stonegrabbers are a bit tougher and they can kill your pet VERY fast, so you are going to want to take taunt off your pet and make shure you can outrun them while having alll you DoT's on them.  After that you pretty much kite them aroudn while your pet beats on them.  The stonegrabbers drop Iron Oxide and Ruset Oxide, both are used for Blacksmithing Iron will sell for about 100 - 150pp and Russet sells for about 5pp both are very uncommon drops got an Iron about every 20 kills and a Russet about the same.  Also watch for words here.  You can lvl here until you are about 31.  From here move to DawnShroud peaks. And go over to the Grieg's End portion of the zone, here you will find Tribal Gatherer's this is what you will be lvling of of until you reach lvl 39.  This is also where you start making a good amount of money.  You pull these uys up on the wall and use the same concept you did with the grabbers. Watch out though they have Stinging Swarm, Entangling Root, and Burst of Flame.  No big problem.  But if you do get rooted and they catch you get ready to Leech the hell outta them they hit for high 60's.  Now they have no pp loot, but they drop things such as Polished Steel Ulak's and Acrylia Brick's The Ulaks can sell for 45pp and you get about 2 an hour.  And the bricks can sell for about 50pp and you get a random amount.  Also the weapons that a lot of the Tribal men have sell for a decent amount 2 - 7pp so you can sell those to venders.  After you are done here you are going to want to head to The Mines of Nurga.  This place takes about a 15 min run but is well worth it.  You are going to want to find the safe room in this zone and set up camp there. You are going to be pulling from any of 4 camps and you can stay here until you are lvl 45.  Also this helps with your Chardok faction.  You seperate the group of  with screaming terror, and then make shure you pet has taunt on cause you want him to take most to all the hits.  You want to make shure you spell line up is something close to this. ) Dooming Darkness 2)Boil Blood 3) Venom of the Snake(this is because Chilling Embrace last WAY to long) 4) Liftap 5) Screaming Terror 6) Fiegn Death 7) Harmshield 8) Gate.  Seeing this you can kinda tell what DoT's you are throwing at him.  If you get a double pull make sure to FD and wait till they get back and try again, I have only had them resist about 4 times now.  Harmshield is always a must on my server, but it always helps to have it up.  And then Gate is a last use thing.  Now the Gobbies that you are fighting all have class specifics.  <br>Easy - Backbiter (rogue) ,Slavedriver (Warrior) ,Warder (Don't Know)\<br>All of these are melee classes, unless the warder cast which he has never done on me.  The warriors are easy but you might want to replace screaming with you pet heal.  They can deal a lost of dmg when they have the whips but seem to do a lot less when they have nothing.  The rogue will own you if you let him get behind you so try not to run away and if you do stay facing him they BS for around 200 (personal experience got hit for 211).  The warder goes down really easy, doens't have HP like war and doesn't have anything special.  The warders drop Shroud of Nature as well which sells for around 150pp.<br><br>Medium - Dirttracer (Enchanter) ,Stalagknight (Sk) ,Blightcaller (Shaman)<br>These guys are a little tougher but most of the time they come running at you.  The chanter nukes for about 190 so be ready to leech, but if you have your pet on him spells usually always get interrupted.  The SK is easy as long as you watch out for his 290 - 310 HT, make sure to have a pet heal up for this one.  The shaman is just like the chanter excpet nukes for less and has a heal.<br><br>Hard - Flashdrowser (Wizard) ,Boneseer (Necro) , Overseer Dlubish (Don't know) , Stonechanter (Cleric)<br>These ones I tried to avoid or pull last as much as possible.  Mr. Wizard likes to use his fast cast 215 knockback nuke and doesn't like to chase you.  If you can get your pet on him and have him concenrate on your pet rather than you your okay, but he nukes for a hell of a lot.  The necro is the hardest one to fight, I have only had him chase me once in the twenty some times I have fought him.  They have Boil Blood, Dooming Darkness(They use there Clining More), and Screaming Terror(which they like to throw at you when you are taping them), and they also tap for 137 so watch out for that too.  The overseer is hard but the easiest one out of them group.  He hits harder then all of them and he has a nuke for about 150 and a he also heals, good thing about this is pet interrupts him a lot.  The cleric is a bitch to drop he nukes for about 150dmg and heals for about 40% of his life, he does not get interrupted easily so he gets a lot of heals of.  At 20% of his life yo should cast your lifetap to try and drop him before his heals go off.  <br>Okay no to talk about the pp loot here, the gobbies drop between 1 - 5pp, and drop fine steel weapons which sell for a nice amount as well.  They drop gobbie skin and salt's that are used for Chardok faction.  Also they drop Whips which is very nice for your dual wielding pet.  The drop Jems, and Jewelry the known one's I have had are Opals, Peridots, Flawless Auamarines and Jade Ring.  All which sell for more than 6pp and highest 18pp.  In a 3 hour time period I get 3 opals, 1 peridot, and a jade ring.  Added on to the 40 or 50pp that the gobbies drop.  <br>I hope this has helped everyone, I can't go any further than this considering this is where I am at but with all of this I have made atleast 30k now goin through these steps.  A lot of that wasted on c3 =)  I hope you all enjoyed it and if you have any question's or comments please send me a Private Tell on here I would be happy to answer any of your quesitons.<br>&nbsp;<br>
