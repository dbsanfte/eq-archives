In the above example, the dot crit did about 9% more damage than the nuke crit.<br /><br />The above example I used 20%.. which wouldn't be right with ID4/BA4, since it's actually closer to around 10% on average give or take a little. (which would result in about 4.5% increase instead of 9)<br /><br />The 'damage bonus' that dot crits receive over nuke crits is dependant on the focus effect you have.<br /><br />So while dot crits aren't even near the same rate as nuke crits, this extra damage you receive with them makes up for it somewhat.</span></font></td>

I see I wasn't exactly clear on my numbers.  Wizards have fewer kiting options when they decide to quad kite.  Wizards quad kiting caster mobs is a very bad idea.  So while they're waiting for repops and mana, we can continue to pull almost anything we want, since we don't burn all our mana as easy while kiting.  You also have to understand that we don't have to take time out to hunt down KEI or VoQ, as gather mana only goes so far.  We also get a gather mana type spell that costs an EE to cast.  The real issue is that necros get reamed on spells that take components to cast.  <br /><br />As far as losing hps with mana regen, I do believe you can wear up to 42 points worth of regen items.  Add that to your innate regen, and hp loss shouldn't be as bad as everyone makes it out to be.<br /><br />Yes, I agree, this is all about class balancing.  The wizard has always been able to beat us when it comes to quick kills.  However, we got them beat when it comes to long fights.  <br /><br />As far as wizards getting a higher chance to do more dps than us for less, I'd say it might be a problem with balancing the wizard class for groups.  I know quite a few people who take necros over wizards for dps in exp groups.  This may just be a case of making it easier for wizards to get groups.</span></font></td>

The argument that if they increase the % we would out-crit wizards is BS. Wizards get yet another DD crit upgrade with GoD also, we just get the slim possibility of crits on our dots. Mind you, I am not saying that our % chance to crit should be as high as a wizards. I don't know what the exact crit percentage chance is for a wizard with max crit aas, but since someone mentioned 40% I will use that as an example. I think that if wizards are getting crits on their DDs 40% of the time that for the 30 aas we should get a progression of 5/10/20, and no GoD DD crit upgrade at all.(If I wanted to chain nuke all day I would play a wizard) We would still be outcritted by wizards by a pretty large margin, but at the same time it would actually be a significant upgrade to our DoTs. As far as per tick vs per spell crit chances I would prefer that it be per spell and that it apply to lifeburn. If it will not dd crit cause of dot component, then they should make it crit from our DoT crit aa.<br /><br />I recently bought GoD thinking that DoT crits, and secondary forte would make it a worthwile expansion. So far I am wishing I had not bought it. The other aas that this expansion brought seem pretty boring to me. I would much rather increase my DoT damage output than be driven further into a role of being a second rate wizard by being given better DD crit chances.<br /><br /></span></font></td>

We were already behind, thats cool, but we gained 9% on dots, pet amount hasnt been determined, but lets say its 9% more.  Then when we do do DD, say for shits and giggles its 9% more.  That means we have to buy EVERY DoT,pet and DD AA to have a across the board 9% gain.  They have to buy one thing.  Then we STILL lose around 5% for our troubles.

Now I see comparisons of mana useage.  Necros have the best mana regen in game!  We can heal ourselves without using bandages.  We can kite several mobs one at a time in the same time it takes a wizard or a druid to do a single quad, let alone medding up for the next one.  Of course, we can also FD if things go bad, and/or rezz ourselves quickly instead of trying to find a cleric and/or wait for one to show up and rezz us.  The other kiting classes have to gate or get a cleric to rezz them.<br /><br />I see critical affliction being used for solo experience grinds.  So it only gives a small chance to do more damage with no change in aggro.  Controlling aggro shouldn't really be a problem for us.  However, more damage means mobs go down quicker.  That can mean fewer spell casts in the long run.  That means less mana useage and less med time, which in turns means more mobs we can kite for more experience.  I see critical affliction as a way we can possibly further improve our mana efficiency in solo situations, while giving us a very mild dps boost in some groups.<br /><br />So stop complaining, when it's clear none of you have thought this through entirely.  If you still have a problem with how necros do their dps, stfu and roll a wizard or whatever then.  It's a game.  Although, I hope you had the foresight to pick the class that best suits your style of play.</span></font></td>

Necros get massive DoTs and pets/utility. <br /><br />The evolution of EQ has made DoTs and pets of marginal importance to high level group play. The evolution of EQ has changed dots from the most mana effiencient damage (in exchange for duration and stacking limits) to the most mana inefficient form of damage. Pets have not kept pace with mobs they are intended to fight. <br /><br />So, if its balanced for a wizard to do 9K of instant damage for around 450-550 mana, or for a mage or druid to do 6K damage for around the same mana, why the heck is it unbalanced for a necro to do a simliar amount of critical dot damage for 500ish mana?<br /><br />After all, necros are going to have a much lower chance of a critical cast compared to wizards anyway. With full GoD AA, a wizard will have over a 40% chance to crit on any given cast. <br /><br /></span></font></td>

The dev team MUST balance our DPS including all the other DPS abilities we already have.  In other words, wizzys don't have a pet. We have a pet that can backstab, can be focussed, can be given mage pet toys, can (with new AA's) flurry and crit. We also can crit on our DD's -- giving us the SAME crit chance as fully AA'd wizzes with our crit affliction line would be overbalanced - We need a middle of the road solution - we may want to have the same chances as wizzes, but in the BIG picture it probably isn't reasonable.<br /><br />Counter-arguments welcome.<br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></font id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"><br /><br /><br />Fine, but it still costs too much</span></font></td>

Anyways, your magelo says you have 94 aa.  You have more important shit to get than GoD aas so I don't see why you even have an opinion.  Go exp grind in LDoN or something.<br /><br />Well, from the sounds of your posts, you consider yourself a DPS class.  I consider myself a pure DPS class.  I also consider wizards a pure dps class.  Sure, we both have some other minor situational raid use... but we're both primarily DPS.  So you're saying if you want to be a pure DPS class that people care about, play a wizard.  If you want to be an inferior pure DPS class, play a necro.<br /><br />Why don't you stop pretending you know about elemental+ wizards when you're obviously clueless.  We are good damage, true.  But, we are NOT outdamaging every class in the game.  High end wizards surpass high end necros pretty handily.  Maybe we're outdamaging every class pre-elemental and even low end elemental but get high elemental or time and you got a different picture.<br /><br />Lastly, read some fucking posts.  Tick based crits &gt; spell based crits.  Not extremely but enough to make me preffer it.  And why would Horror do 860 damage a tick?

Making crit dots roll for each tick is a waste. <br /><br />I'm seriously considering rolling a wizzie. First, they are in demand as a raiding class due to their damage. Second, with teleports and PoK, they are never far from MGB. Third, it is not hard to get a wizard acceptable mana regen. Fourth, jboots are insanely easy to get. and finally, it takes 1 day to go from 1-25, and once you start quadding, maybe 100 hours to get to 50ish or even higher. <br /><br />Throwing mandatory wizzie quests such as staff of temperate flux or jboots in the equation will lengthen this out.
