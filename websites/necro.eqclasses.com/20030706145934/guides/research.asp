			At this point, a necromancer's life becomes a bit more intruguing. You're 
finally level sixteen, and you have to research to get that starving creature 
that hangs around you bigger. Along with nearly ever pet spell from this point 
forward, you also have to research some very vital spells that will decide your 
fate in Norrath.<br>&nbsp;<br>We here at Eqclasses feel for you, so 
we've decided to give you this table outlining what components you need to 
research with, as well as how important it is to have these spells, based on our 
infinate wisdom about necromancy. <br>&nbsp;<br>The first thing that needs to be 
done is going to your guild, wether it be in A'kanon, Cabilis, Freeport, Neriak, 
or Paineel. Now you need to purchase what is called The Book of Dark Bindings. 
This is a vital part of your research, as you cannot research without it. The 
next part of research involves getting Words. Words can be found on nearly every 
creature in norrath that is above level sixteen. The tricky part is finding out 
which creatures actually drop the specific words that you need for that awesome 
spell you need. <br>&nbsp;<br>Research is often times not needed for acquiring a 
spell, because some of them can be purchased from vendors across Norrath. These 
spells that can be purchased, will be noted as such. You do, however need to 
research, because there are a good many spells that cannot be found anywhere but 
on the sets of words needed to create the spell. <br>&nbsp;<br>The only drawback 
to research is that when you have the words that you need, you place them in the 
Book of Dark Bindings, and hit the combine, only to discover that unfortunately 
you lacked the skills to make the spell and the words vaporize. Now not only do 
you not have the spell you were trying for, you're out words that took you hours 
to acquire. Fear not, there is a way to improve your research skills and not use 
those invaluable words. <br>&nbsp;<br>There's 2 ways to go about this now. First 
if you're of good alignment, meaning that people other than your townsfolk 
tolerate you. If so, then you may be able to acquire what is called a 
Concordance of Research from North Karana. For those of you who are of Evil 
alignment, there is a place you can go as well. <br>&nbsp;<br>The Concordance of 
research is acquired at the gypsy camp in North Karana. You must speak to 
Mrysila, about the concordance. She tells you that if you bring her lightstones 
and greater lightstones, she will give you one of the volumes that you seek. It 
is a good idea to keep giving her the stones until you recieve all of the 
volumes that she has. There is also a book that she gives you that lists all of 
the components to make the runes which are made in the Concordance. This allows 
you to increase your research skill, but not lose the words that are used to 
make your spells. <br>&nbsp;<br>For those of you with Evil alignment, you must 
go to the Southern Desert of Ro, and seek out a Dark Elf Sorceress, if you talk 
to her, then she will assist you in learning the skill of research, and will 
give you the tools that are required for increasing your skills. You basically 
have to do the exact same things that the good alignment people have to do. Give 
her a greater lightstone for the Concordance of Research, and give her 
lightstones for a random text, telling you the combinations of components that 
you have to have to make the runes you need to practice with. <br>&nbsp;<br>Keep 
in mind, with both of these methods, the runes that you produce must be combined 
in your Book of Dark Bindings for you to actually increase your skill. Combining 
the runes in the Concordance does nothing, and you have wasted your time. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>You can create the spells above your 
current level, this is often recommended if you are hunting creatures that are 
dropping words that are above your level. Keep in mind that the higher the level 
of the spell, the higher your research skill needs to be. So often times if you 
find words lying on the ground or at a merchant, check to see if they are within 
your range of research. We recommend that you do not research any spells that 
are two spell levels or more above you. Meaning that if you're level twenty, we 
recommend that you only research the level twenty, twenty-four, and twenty-nine. 
Going above this level, will result in failures more times than not. Your 
research skill can go to two-hundred, so we recommend that you do the 
Concordance quests to get you started. <br>&nbsp;<br>With the addition of LoY, many of our higher level
spells can now be researched.  Getting your research skill to 200 will not only ensure a successful combine, but 
also
give you a nice way to make some extra plat.  All wisdom based casters will use intelligence based casters to 
research
their spells.  If you have a remarkable research skill, you will be able to make some of the most powerful spells 
in the game
and sell them for a nice profit.<br>&nbsp;<br>
