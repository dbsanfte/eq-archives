Mekrath is at level 55, and I am getting a little bit bored of the constant exp grind.  I decided to play an alt a little bit for some variety.  I have tried a bunch of classes in the past and I seem to be drawn to the int casters the most.  Right now I have a 19 Magician, 11 Wizard, and 6 Enchanter.  I'm trying to decide which one to continute to level, as I only have time to play one of them along with my Necromancer.  I would like some words of wisdom from those of you who have tried some of these as alts. Keeping in mind the levels  I have played these 3 to, here is what I have found.

Magician - at level 19 I feel like a nerfed Necromancer.  I can't fear kite, I can't snare.  I like the pet as I am used to it with my main, but he doesn't seem tough enough to take a beating.  Medding is excruciatingly slow.

Enchanter - At level 6 I am dying constantly.  It is because I am racing to 8 and taking on stuff I probably shouldn't.  The reason I created the Enchanter is becasue it seems to me that it would be a challenge to play and require thought and strategy.  This character is too young to have seen anything of the class though.  I do NOT intend to jewelcraft, BTW.

Wizard - At level 11, so far I am having a good time.  Blasting stuff is fun, but I don't know if it will be tedious after a bunch more levels.  I have been able to solo pretty well to this point due to the Lost Staff of the Scorned that my main found in CoM and gave to this character.  It is a 11/24 2HB that is a mana free right click Nek Gate at level 47.  With the damage it does, I can still melee well, though Im sure by 16 that will be over.  I like the fact that I will be able to port, as I hate travel with my necro.  My only concern would be later on nuking and medding might get boring.

If anyone could relate some experiences that would help me out, I would greatly appreciate it.  Am I missing something about the magician?  Does a Wizard get boring?  Is an Enchanter a great, fun challenge or a PITA?  Thanks!

Also, I bet at some point you will tash/mez, get aggro, and try and cast FD or HS and realize, you are not on your necro and go, oh &*^% I am about to die. And then you do.</P><P>Wizard range rocks. And playing a char with decent nukes is really fun. Watch things die real quickly! Seeing how common as dirt (at least on my server) KEIs is, and chanters in general, you too will not be terribly worrying about mana. I would say also, tho, get some HP rings to start, if anything, Wizards get pounded on the most, and I would try and get some AC up also. Chanters get aggro easy, but so do wizards. Also, don't nuke too early, otherwise it will be "Hail, a_nuking_wizard's corpse." And also, remember that you can't use necro tricks to get outta aggro.</P><P>And for the end game, expect not to be grouped unless you a chanter. And on a raid, well, wizards will have more fun, while mages will be making mod rods all day and chanters will dread the /tell Speed plz.</P><P>I personally would stick to your wizard for a sake of variety. As far as INT casters go, it's totally different than a necromancer. No pet, no mezzing or DoTs, just really cool nukes + porting and TLing later.</P><P>Saminga Amaranth, 59th (STILL, yeah, I know :P) Bad Girl of Avatars of Discord, Rodcet Nife.</P><P>Good girls go to Heaven, bad girls FD and /q out.</font></td>

Magicians are such a crap class compared to necros hehe.  And that's not an exaggeration.  When you look at it seriously they only get pets, nukes, invis and gate.  I don't even count their crappy summons.  For necros the pet is just another tool with which to get the job done.  There's just no comparison between the two classes.</P><P>Wizards eh well been there done that.  You're in worse shape than a magician from 1-20.  After 29 things get better and if you have alot of money in the bank you'll have no problem leveling.  Just remember that any class can level fast if you have the cash to dole out for buffs.  Plus since now you can bind in Timor I would say their gating ability is vastly overrated unless you regularly hunt deep into Luclin.  I wouldn't bother with the wizard unless you think the game starts at 60 and are in a hardcore raiding guild.</P><P>I keep meaning to get going on an enchanter but I've played one to 13 and it was a bitch.  Sure 1-10 is real fast and I have a 10/22 1hb in the bank but 12-16 would still be rough for grouping.  Also most people hunt in boring outdoor zones which means all they really want is speed and crack for 49 levels.  Still it's gotta be fun.  I guess my only real problem would be the high level of concentration it takes to play an enchanter well in dungones.</P><P> </font></td>

Very limited spells selection.  You got DD, AE, PBAE, Rain, and Ports. These come in several flavors, and they can at least cast invis on others, but that's about it.  No Pet, Snare isn't till level 29-short lived and AE to boot- No Mez, charm, fear......</P><P>AH, but the power.  The Nukes are awesome, and more so with the Foci.  Mana Management is HARD without good buffs, but a Wizard on Full Burn can usually get the job done if he's over half mana. </P><P><BR>Then, the other 2 choices are more what your used too.</P><P>Chanters have the Mana Regen, and much improved CC ability. They Nuke well enough, have a few Dots, and many buffs that everyone likes.  They are like everything nice about Necromancers ,only better, except the pet, and all the spells are usable on anyone. No Snare is the only problem here.  Boon of the Garou especially burns my butt, since it is haste and allows a LIFETAP PROC, which even we cannot do.  If anyone should be turning people into lifetapping werewolves, it's us.</P><P>Mages are like the flipside. They have stronger pets than us, but more limited in options than the wizards without the pet.  The DS is REALLY nice, and you will never want for a backpack. Some of the Summonses are Ok, but most need to be re-evaluated in the light of 3 expansions.</P><P>So, IMO, Go Wizard if your looking for true Variety, or go one of the other 2 if you want to see our abilities done better, but with important gaps in our skillset.</P><P>"Know Fear through me, Not of me."</font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> I'm currently lvling a chanter as my alt (lvl 46).  Quite frankly, its really not what i envisioned.  Dont get me wrong, there are moments where this class totally owns, but those moments seem too few and far in between.  There are very few things that are more exciting and thrilling than locking down a train of 7 mobs, but honestly, its rare that you'll see a pull of over 3 mobs at any point in time.</P><P>Whether we like it or not, the primary structure of an xp group is to have mobs single chain pulled.  Groups tend to congregate in safe xp zones (aka velks, dl, ot, etc...), and heavily shy away from anything that might represent a challenge.  In the absence of a challenging camp (constant multi pulls, roamers, adds, trains), a chanter is pretty much left with 2 functions, buffing (clarity, haste) and debuffing (slowing and tash).  This i have found to be very boring.</P><P>With my chanter, i've boycotted DL, and have avoided the kunark express as much as possible.  The only problem is that the zone's that are ideal for my level (the hole, l guk, etc...), are overcamped by lvl 55+ loot farmers, and are completely void of anyone hunting for xp.  </P><P>A big plus for the class is that its a great group class and finding groups will rarely be an issue.  Its like nite and day in comparison to the necro class, as you'll generally find yourself getting tells when zoning into xp zones appropriate for your lvl.</P><P>So, my advice to you is the following:<BR>- If you lvl your enchanter, have some friends that will level with you.  This is so u can quickly build a group for some of the funner chanter zones and dungeons, and avoid the kunark express like the plague.</P><P>- Be prepared to buff, buff, buff and buff.  Requests for haste and clarity will cycle as the buffs fade.  It sometimes get to the point where terms like crack plz or need speed will make u cringe, because you'll have heard them 100+ in a nite.</P><P>- Be prepared for frustration.  People break mezzes over and over and over again.  Some people cant comprehend the concept of a mez and why its beneficial fora  group to assist the assigned MT.</P><P>- Be prepared to miss your necro.  Chanters cant solo nearly as well as a necro.  Chanters are a relatively impotent offensive class (with the exception of charm). Chanters cant lifetap.  Chanters cant lich. Etc...</P><P>Lastly, no class is as complex or as challenging as a necro.  There are just so many things we can do.  As a chanter, my biggest decisions are whether to AoE mez, or PBAoE stun + single mez a big train.  Everything else is pretty much clockwork.  I miss the complexity of our class and the constant role changes we have as we insert or delete different people from our groups.</P><P>Anyhow, thats my long winded 2cp for u regarding the chanter class. Hope this helps and best of luck finding a good alt.</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=55675" target="_blank">Tencor Laureate - 60th Warlock</a><br><BR><a href="http://www.veilofsilence.org" target="_blank">Veil of Silence</a><br> <BR>Innoruuk Server</font></td>
