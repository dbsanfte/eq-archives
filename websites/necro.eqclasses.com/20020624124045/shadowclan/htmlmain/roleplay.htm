                              they are encouraged to have one character. If a 
                              person has two attending a raid they decided which

                              people do a raid they are encouraged to have one 
                              character. If a person has two or more attending 
                              a raid, using two or more computers, they decided 
                              which one would be their main for looting purposes. 
                              Obviously it is poor form to have a second logged

                              especially when the alt’s main is playing at the

                              to rot then logging in another to loot or deferring 
                              to an alt also makes sense. Basically rolling for 
                              loot is one player per raid and not per character 
                              on a raid when a person is playing more then one
