They are close but still not as good. Argue if you want but I tried them both and if you do the same you will agree with me. Also this spot is about the easiest hunting you will probably have done up till now once you get the hang of it. Also keep in mind that these Goblins drop a Harpoon of the Depths on a rare drop. I managed to snag me 7 of these and they sell for around 2k pp on my server. These Harpoons are lore so be sure and have either a druid friend who can port these for you or get a mule close by that can take them in case one drops while you still have one. I had 3 drop in one 6 hour camp. That is rare but could happen so be prepared for it.<br><br>

I want to give credit to all the guys on EQNecro message board that gave me some of these tips. I made a request there on some guidance and got several good replies that lead me to learning this camp for myself. Thanks guys!<br><br>

If you have Jboots this will make things ALLOT easier. I never tried it without jboots so I am not 100% sure if it can be done. But I would guess it can be. This may change the safety rating . At any rate I'm gonna tell you how I did it and maybe someone who has done them without Jboots can answer that question on the additional comments section at the bottom?<br><br>

Ok to get started you will need to make a pet and park him at or around -380 -1180. I didn't use Intensify death here and I will explain later why not. Med back to full. Make sure you have at least these spells mem'd, Dead Man Floating, Screaming Terror, Dooming Darkness, Invoke Fear, VOS (or your choice of DOT), Level 1 Lifetap, Drain Soul and Call of Bones. Once you get the spawns broke you can replace Screaming Terror with Feign Death if you feel the need. Ok there are 4 main spawns you can pull from. There are 2 porch looking things and 2 big white towers. The 2 porch's are located at -125 -516 and -721 -511 the 2 towers are at +37 -134 and -764 -120. Whenever it was possible I pulled from the 2 porch's but you can do any combo of the 2. Just wanna let you know though, that if you park your pet at the camp loc I gave above and you pull from the towers, be sure and stop about half way back to your camp when pulling or the mob will return back to his spawn point. It only takes a few seconds and then you can move on to the camp. Once you have decided where you are gonna pull from buff yourself with DMF and run to the spot above the water. I say above the water because there are Barracuda's in static spawn places and unless you know where they are its safest to run out to the porch or tower then dive in. Ok dive down and you will see the 2 spawns of goblins. Pick one out and hit it with Screaming Terror. If it sticks the other goblin will agro on you. As soon as the spell goes off point straight up to the top of the water and swim up. Once at the top point to your camp and levi back to your waiting boner. Be sure and un-target the ST'd mob and be ready for the new one once at the camp. Target it when it hits the shore and send in your pet. You may have to back off a bit to get enough room for you to stick Dooming Darkness on it. Once its darked hit it with fear and your DOT of choice. Now this can be argued but here is what I did. After I hit it with my DOT I always backed off my pet. I did this to ensure that my DOT did its max damage and with the DOT effect of Darkness I wanted to make sure I did over half of the Damage to these Gobs. It ensures that I get max XP credit for the kill. These Gobs only have 1300 HP so it doesn't take much for them to die. This is also the reason I didn't Augment my pet because once you get the 49 pet he is gonna kick some major butt and I want to make sure I do the most damage. Now cast Call of Bones and run back out to the spawn and be ready, as soon as you hit the water the Gob that you hit with ST is gonna come at you. I usually waited till he hit me then ran back to my camp. Sometimes, after you ST one he may not agro on you when you get back, so what you need to do then is swim down and hit it with your level 1 lifetap. The purpose of using the level one lifetap is because it does such smaller damage, that way when you get back to your pet it will immediately do more damage and change the agro to him allowing you time to get your Dark and fear on it. Once this Gob dies you may have to Med a bit. Once your med up run out to your next spawn point and repeat the above. Now if ST is resisted and it will be some, Don't panic. Now is your chance to be what we necro's are and that is AWESOME solo artist's. Run back to your pet and send him in on one. Don't worry about it for now cause your pet will agro one on him. Run back away form the other a bit and hit it with dark and fear. Once the second one is feared run back to the first one hit it with dark and fear and DOT it. Keep fear on as it breaks on both mobs. I usually hit the second one with my DOT also. Once your Pet and DOT kills the first one send him to the second one and everything is A'OK. Another option is to use ST again once on shore. Either way is fine. I like to fear kite them both for the excitement it brings and it will impress any newbie's that are close to watch you do your magic. 
Once you get all your level 49 spells. The new pet and your Bond of Death and Lich combo will change things for you to the point where you can pull more than just the 2 spawn points. I also want to mention that there are 4 more Bloodgills at the entrance into the temple there. But be warned, there is a marauder that is just inside the gate that will agro with any of the 4 outside. You can single pull the Bloodgills at the gate sometimes without the marauder but he will come most all the time. This guy hits much harder than the Bloodgills and has more HP but at level 49 he is not a problem. He can be done with the 44 spells but it is much more difficult so be warned.<br><br>

You could ride this spot out till level 52 but almost everything starts greening out at 50. I have seen level 51 people there till 52. I recommend that you start this camp at level 44 because thats when you get DMF and without the under water breathing ability and the levitation combo it would just be to hard. Could be done earlier of course in a group with a class that can cast levitation. But not solo till 44.<br><br>

Quick side note, I bought me a kitchen timer with 2 timers on it. Once I killed the first Gob in a camp I would hit the timer. The Gobs are on a 13 minute spawn time so set the timer at 12 minutes. The reason I did this was because since I didn't sit on the bottom to guard the camp from thieves, I knew when the spawn was about to pop and was there in time to make sure I got it.<br><br>

I hope this helps and good luck on some of the easiest XP your gonna ever make!</td></tr><tr><td width='98' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma' size='2'>Author</td><td width='499' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma'size='2'><a href ='mailto:lastout@fireman.net'>Fallonn</td></tr><tr></table><br><br></table></div>
