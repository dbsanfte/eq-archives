				1-7 Bone chips.  These drop off skelletons in all newbie zones.  Either save them (you WILL need them later) or sell them to players for 15-20pp per stack.  This is a good way to buy items off merchants then sell them to players.<br><br>8-15 I know this sounds like a big span, but bear with me.  In WK just north of the Qhills zone is a small village.  Before you go here, load up with as many bags as you can carry.  You will need them.  Your target is  Misty Storyswapper.  She is a bard, and will kill your bard faction, but this is THE best camp.  Storyswapper will con red for a while, but goes down fast and does not that hit hard. Setup at the trees just south of the village.  Summon a pet with taunt off and have him guard at the 3rd tree south.  Be sure to keep an eye out for the currupt guard that comes to shake the bard down every so often....he makes things fun.  Stand at the first tree(should be almost at max spell range)with your back to the village and cast darkness on her.  Right as darkness is done casting run at your pet.  You should get to him just as the casting bar returns.  Send pet as you DOT with your choice of dots.  If pet out damages you, apply one lifetap which should get you the agro.  Then once you have agro, run in a triangle (make your own up).  This will keep her in a well contained area to make her death simple.  Be sure to stop at the corners to make sure she is close, but not in melee range.  If darkness drops, fear and nuke.  As with every level from here out, keep your mana regen up unless you drop below 1 bubble of health, or have access to a C3.  She drops a madolin (0.0 weight) that sells for 1-2pp each to a merchant.  I would advise using some of this money to buy some cha gear.  The target charisma is 118~120.  Two 25cha stiens normally does the job.  The amount of pp you will make by this increase will pay for the gear in just a few levels.<br><br>16-19  Head to OOT.  The first stop from Freeport is called sister island.  Get famliar with this island, because it is make for necros.  Your first target is on the west side of the island.  There are 4-6 spawns of Sisters of Erollisi.  They are an easy take down.  Pull with darkness to pet along the shoreline.  Sick pet and dot, letting pet tank.  Heal pet as needed, rinse repeat.  Sisters drop a belt(uncommon) that sells for ~2pp to a merchant of for 5-10pp in bazaar.<br><br>20-23  Stay at sister island.  On the north side of the island are three dwarfs.  One is on a hill on the northeast corner, another is at the same corner, but down at the water, and the third is on the north west corner just outside of a hut.  Don't worry about the dwarf in the hut; he is a merchant which you can sell to for a bit untill you become KoS.  Killing here is about the same as the bard from before, just simple agro kiting.  Be sure to stay close to the shoreline both while kiting and medding, otherwise you have the posability of getting 2 diffrent pirates as adds.  The dwarfs don't drop much to sell, but drop up to 5pp in coins and the ocational words.<br><br>23-32  Congratulations.  You are on your way to being a real necro.  Time for another seemingly long camp at sister island.  This time your target are the named sisters near the docks.  Setup camp on the hill to the west over looking the dock.  Summon pet with taunt off and have him gaurd at your camp..this makes for a quick and easy reset without lossing him.  First pull is going to be the named by the tree.  If you can get lucky, wait for the pirate to come up and start beating on her.  He has a 12 min spawn time, and she has a 6 min spawn time, so he will only be around every other spawn, if even then.  While the are fighting, darkness and dot her.  The pirate will go down fairly quick, and she will be at 80 pct without any dots, so anything beyond that is gravy.  wait untill she is almost right on you, if not untill she tries to hit you, and run down the shoreline with old bones hitting her in the back.  Run to the top of the second hill and cast one lifetap.  By the time she gets to you she will almost be running.  If she is not running, just run her in a circle for a bit.  Rinse and repeate on the sister on the dock.  You should have enouph down time between spawns to med to full.  Once you hit 29 (or sooner if you are good) just the two spawns seem a bit little, so time to add in the two in the west hut.  If you try to kill both at the same time, both you and your pet will die.  To split these up, you will have to learn FD pulling.  This is really easy.  Through the window, target the closest sister, and get at max spell range.  Then cast darkness on her and run away from the hut untill your spell bar comes back, then cast FD.  If Fd is successful, you will watch one sister walk back into the hut while the other just stands there.  If FD fails, just let pet tank while you FD and watch hit die.  Remember, it is quicker to cast a new pet than it is to make a CR, so don't try to be a hero.  This camp can be bone with another necro as a partner.  Just add the two sisters inside the inn and the sister by the water.  Almost no down time.  *WARNING* Stay far away from the east hut.  There is a warrior trainer that will own you and your pet before you even know what happened.<br><br>32-40  Head to WC and the druid rings.  Your target is the nasty druids.  FYI there are 3 people that spawn at 2 locations, both just south and west of the druid ring.  2 are druids and the third is a female ranger.  They are all easy.  Setup on the hill just south of the rigns.  Giants used to path here, but they now go directly to the ring and gets killed by the merchant.  summon and buff pet.  It is a good idea to give your pet weapons to activate dual wield.  I find mages in the bazaar selling summoned pet only weapons and other gear for about 2-5pp each.  Don't worry, you will make your money back after a kill or two.  Now target one druid then the other.  Be sure to assign the toggle target button to an easy to use key (I use \ just above the enter key).  Now, send pet after one then toggle to the other and fear it.  Pet may get hurt a bit and rooted, but there is no problem.  Now toggle to the first and drkness and fear it.  By this time the first is just about to have fear wear off, so re fear(unless you have envoke fear, if so just skip this).  Then dot the second with your first really good dot, VoS.  Do not dot the first.  You want their deaths to be spread out enouph to have one dead before the other spawns.  After one is killed, do the same to the last one.  Remember to keep feared.  These guys have annoying dots and can heal themselfs.  I like to set a 6 minute timer after the first one is killed, so I know when he is about the spawn.  After the camp is broken, med right where they will respawn.  That way, when they pop, they will attack you rather than buffing themselfs.  When they attack you, the pet will agro and quickly taunt it off.  Loot is comonly a fine steel sword and some pp.  I have gotten 2 FS waepons, a bow and a piece of armor off one kill.  Loot is easy to get rid of.  There is a merchant that is on beta nutrual faction at the ring, so just dawn your charisma gear and sell to her.  If you get loaded down with coins, just /ooc and find a newbie that will happly relieve you of your cp and sp and change some of your gp into pp.  I generaly do a 80pct trade, just to save time.  If exp gets too slow, add the guards at the toll booth.  This is decent exp, and great loot till 44.<br><br>44-48  Time to rub elbows with 50+ people.  Get a port to DL.  At the combine ruines in the valley, there is a temple filled with the dead.  Ah, for the first time, a good place with dead monsters.  The temple is on the north side, with only a small pyramid north of that.  I like to setup on the pyramid.  Summon pet and have him guard at the temple enterance.  Use sence the dead to get a target, and pull with spirit shackle.  once he is at the temple enterance, sicks pet and dot with asystole.  No need to fear.  You can use a low lvl undead DD to increase your evocation, which is used by your most efficant DD spell.  The skeletons go down fairly quick and drop words and pp.  the is an iksar merchant in the center of the ruines if you get full.  I don't know what faction he is on, but was indiff to me.  Heal pet as needed, and try to keep out of the fights.  There are skellies that path to the corner otside the temple, so watchout.  You can stay here to 50~51, but there are more challenging places awaiting you.<br><br>49-60  Time to watch the noobs get awed.  Head to Felwithe.  time for guard killing at its finest.  Head to the back of the city, at the bait and tackle shop.  Setup is going to be inside the back room of this shop.  Be warry of the new rodents that open the door, which can give you a guard to kill before you are ready.  Once you are buffed and have a pet out, exit the shop and stick to the right.  If you go too far left you will agro a caster that nukes for 400-500 and quads for 200.  Your first guard is guard Hutian.  He spawns just outside the cleric guild and walks all the way to the south Felwithe zone, then back again.  Find him first, otherwise you will have trouble. Pull with nullify magic, sick pet, dot, BoD and pact pet.  These guys hit fairly hard, but slowly.  They have one big heal then a bunch of smaller heals.  Just keep your pat alive and all is well.  Once the first guard is dead, move to the archs near the water.  You will be pulling the wandering guards as they come to the center of their platform infront of the cleric guild.  You can pull when they are to the right of the guild, but do not pull when they are to the left.  If you do, you will get two guards from inside the bank.  There are 3 wanderers.  Once all are dead, FD split the guards inside the bank.  This is a good camp till 51 when you get splirt.  Once 51, go to the Gfay zone line and setup camp here.  First target is Guard Legver.  He paths through your camp and past the zoneline.  If you don't see him first, wait untill he comes back from either direction.  Killing is just about the same as in the back, but now you have splirt which makes the kills faster and more efficent.  Once Legver is dead, if there are only two guards on your end of the bridge, pull the guard on the right of the bridge with splirt.  He will do a crazy little dance, but will not agro the other guard.  IF ther are three guards, pull the one in the middle first, then the one on the right.  After those are dead, pull the onse on the other side of the bridge by standing as far to the side of the bridge as posable and let the guard on the oposite side agro.  Don't move untill he hits you.  This will keep the other guard from agroing.  If you get both, just run back to the ent and FD while telling your peck to back off.  If you get all those guards and have time to spare, pick up the wandering guards, Guard Hutian, and the two from inside the bank.  This should keep you busy for a long while.  About 53 or so you can try adding in the guards in the skyway.  Just DMF yourself and by climbing up a tree and acrost some rooftops, you can get into the walkways.  Once there, call your pet to you with summon compainion and takout the guards up there.  This should take you to 60.  Every guard drops a sword that sells for 20pp and the ocational FS weapon, and almost always 4-5pp.<br><br>Post 60 is yet to be known by me since I am yet to get there.  When I get that info from experience, I will add it.  This is what I did/would have done if I knew then what I know now.  I have gotten to lvl 52 in just 3 months of casual play, all soloing.<br>&nbsp;<br>
