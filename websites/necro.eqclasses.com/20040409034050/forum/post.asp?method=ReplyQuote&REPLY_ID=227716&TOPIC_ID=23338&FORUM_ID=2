[br]hes not trying to say all should do exactly what he says. hes just trying to make you guys think about the NBG system more.  and the name need before greed implies that its a fair system when its not at all.  I keep trying to convince my guild that this system isn't fair at all.  that platinum has as good a chance of being used as an upgrade as a droppable.  for isntance whose to say that droppable item isn't gonna be sold by the person whoc an use it, or who can say what a person is gonna be using his plat on.  most people make a huge and mistaken assumption that droppable gear is always going to be used when they think about the NBG system.  after trying to explain this to them I was called greedy...yea like I got a better chance of getting those FT3 boots now that the entire guild is bidding on them with their dkp points.  I keep telling them that I keep trying to make my point because I know I am rite.  their ignorance makes me want to cry.  anyways yea thats my thought on it.

It's a system thats easy to explain.<br /><br />If you would equip an item, then you can roll on it.<br /><br />You cant get any easier than that to explain. It sounds like a very fair system and thats one of the reasons it's so popular. The idea is that sometimes wiz casters will be the ones rolling.. Sometimes int casters.. sometimes tanks.. sometimes pure melee.. sometimes just one class would roll on an item. But over time you would roll it would balance out.<br /><br />This system sounds very fair.<br /><br />Thats the great myth.<br /><br />NBG is actually an unfair system. It's also a system thats easy to abuse. NBG looks fair at first glance, but on a closer look you will (hopefully) see it for what it is. To attempt to explain i'm going to make up an imaginary group and place them in a few situations.<br /><br />Imagine this group:<br /><br />1) Warrior (uber gear)<br />2) Pally (average gear)<br />3) Rogue (average gear)<br />4) Necro (average gear - the one that formed the group)<br />5) Beastlord (good gear)<br />6) Cleric (Great gear - Farms all the time, in VERY good droppable gear)<br /><br />Lets Imagine 2 diffrent situations.<br /><br />a) FT3 boots camp in CT.<br />b) BoT towers hopeing for ornate.<br /><br />In situation (a), When the boots drop only one person would be rolling on them. The necro. Thats the only person in the group that would actualy use the boots, so they get defaulted to him under NBG.<br /><br />In situation (b)..<br />Leather drops: Monk and Beastlord roll.<br />Silk drops: Necro rolls.<br />Plate drops: Pally rolls<br />Chain: Rogue rolls.<br /><br />Now at first glance this looks fair, but when you loot closer you will see that it isnt fair at all. <br /><br />For one thing, The necro that formed the group abused the system by makeing sure that no one in the group could use the items he wanted so he made sure the group didnt get another silk wearer.. Thats one problem with the NBG system... It's easy to abuse.. just make sure you form the group and that you form it with people that will not be rolling on the same stuff you are. (note: this assumes that the necro formed the group that way delibertatly)<br /><br />The cleric didnt get the FT3 boots because she farmed an insane amount of cash for the Ornate Plate Boots.. She cant now recover some of the cash she sunk into thoes boots by selling the FT3 boots because of NBG. <br /><br />The first camp droped something that could have sold for 80k, but only the necro had a chance to get it, everyone else walked away with nothing. They deserve the same chance of getting an upgrade!<br /><br />The second camp dropped something for everyone but the cleric and warrior. Both of them put in the same work and time.. They deserve the same chance of getting an upgrade!<br /><br />===================================================<br /><br />NBG is the welfare system of EQ.<br /><br />Thoes who have done more work/time/whatever supporting thoes who have not.<br /><br />Now before you think i'm being mean with that statement, really think about it and tell me it's not true.<br /><br />Many people only play a couple hours a week, many had RL stuff come up and had to take a break from EQ for a while.. They deserve the same chance that everyone else has... not a better chance than anyone else.<br /><br />It's not that thoes that play more and have better gear are "better" or "deserve" it more... it's that they deserve the SAME chance.<br /><br />I dont think that I should get more than you because i'm poorer than you, and I also dont think that I should get more because i'm richer than you.<br /><br />I support equil rights.<br /><br />I dont support the unfairness that is NBG.. <br /><br />Not when I'm the only int caster and everything would default to me and when it doesnt.<br /><br />I just want to use a fair system.<br /><br />go go gravy!<br /><br /></span></font></td>

DKP best form of loot distribution because it based on only fair principle (btw it IS socialistic lol) you get from guild as much as you contribute to guild. <br />Last time about NBG - look every dropable loot have PP value - EVERYONE in group contributed to earn those PP then why some of you think that it is fair to exlude part of group from distribution of those PP?

Maybe 99% of guild groups or something, but I've never been in a BoT group where silk legs dropped and they say GO AHEAD AND LOOT THEM NECRO, YOU NEED EM.  There's a good reason for this, everyone can sell any ornate that drops and buy their own ornate/whatever they wanna buy.  Luckily I got a great guild that gets me phat ele gear and I don't have to bother with any ornate other than legs, which I'd rather buy then spend time camping west wing in BoT.  But thanks for the idea...maybe I'll try to start a NBG group in BoT and not invite any silk users and just hope Hreindar Leinlanngafssa or whatever spawns.  Personally I'd rather see someone that could use something get it b/c I'm finally getting where I don't need $ for much other than EE's and stuff along those lines.

Unless you have specifically factored out ALL the variables in the equation, it's a crapshoot of what classes will be in your group, what camp you will get, who is going to use it and who is going to sell it, who actually needs it since they are a poor ass player that is a nice person, for example. If you take out these variables, and go "Hey, we are going to camp the Copper Hammer of Striking for Arione coz he needs one" then, go to it.<br /><br />In a pick up group, there are so many variables you don't know, that coming in with a preconceived idea like NBG when you don't have all the factors at your command, you cannot, not even the geniuses of the world, make a proper judgement without that information. It's not like we can tell how much cash people have in the bank, whether this is their main or a twink, how many accounts they have and stuff. We simply don't know, so no matter how objective we can be, we cannot truly be a proper arbiter for a "fair" system, NBG or otherwise.<br /><br />In DKP, there is a strict account of how much you have put into the guild, and how much you can get from it, by comparison. This doesn't take into anyone's details on how good their character is equipped, but considering it really only applies to no drop gear for the most part, people aren't going to waste their DKP on something they can't use.<br /><br />When we roll on something, we leave Chance as the final arbiter. Chance is a bitch, but ultimately fair, coz unless someone can load the dice in EQ, it's really not up to anyone who gets the item, ergo it's a level playing field.<br /><br />As someone else suggested, if you win something, you can be an arbiter of justice and give it away, as your choice. However, this choice is *not* forced upon you, it is completely up to the individual whether they wish to make these choices. And the associated karma. Forced virtue has no virtue.<br /><br />For the record ... I transferred Saminga and lost all her gear. I don't expect NBG, even though I am sorely lacking in equipment, and I lost all my hard earned DKP loot in the transfer. And I still oppose NBG. I don't expect a handout simply because I am a transfer, what I at least want is an opportunity to roll on an item I can use. I can live with that.<br /><br />Saminga Amaranth, 65th Deathbitch Spankmistress.</span></font></td>

What's more, many people did not have the time or interest to go /auction in East Commons for hours on ends in order to sell loot they cannot use. Thus, people eventually got tired of having /random decide their fate. They implemented the NGB system to make sure that people of a certain class would get the loot they needed the fastest and to prevent people of another class to price-gouge in Ecommons. This is especially appealing when considered alongside camps such as the frenzied camp in Lower Guk - no one liked seeing a caster walk off with a FBSS while the monk who needed the item had to wait another 10+ hours for it to drop.

Obviously, this twink is far more "fortunate" than anyone of the same level.  Now consider someone who just started EQ and has exactly jack.  His character is obviously far "poorer" than the twink.<br /><br />Now you could, of course, argue that because you put in more time on your level 65 necro your twink is better, but how is that different than someone claiming that their parents put more time into their businesses and thus that's why they have more money? It's the same principle - people, like characters, are not born equal.  Our relations are not the same - the person who just started EQ has no guild and no friends to twink him, but you and I do.<br /><br />As mentioned, NBG is not a *WAY* to be "nice" to people - it's a SYSTEM.  Of course it would be "nice" of a person to win a roll and still let his loot be given to the person who need it the most, but that assumes a certain degree of faith in human nature that does not typically exist.  NGB, like randoming, is a way of balancing equality of opportunity with overall (economic) equality.  Friends and generous people don't *NEED* such a system to distribute loot.  It's the people who are NOT friends and who are NOT generous that require such a system to govern them.<br /><br />With that overall stance stated, let me respond to a few of your points:<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">In EQ you dont have money only if you chose not to make it a priority... A level 65 with poor gear, chose to be in that situation.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />So? It's the same as in RL - people who are on welfare can be "argued" to have CHOSEN to be in that situation by not going to school, not working hard, etc.  Of course, there's also the other side of it: not being able to go to school, not being able to work hard, etc.  But the same applies to EQ - what if the player CAN'T play much.  What if he CAN'T join a guild? What if he IS anti-social and don't have many friends? Are you going to hold that against him as you would hold the supposed "disabilities" of a poor person in RL against him? For each argument there is a counter-argument.  The player who couldn't play that much could've played more.  The person who didn't have enough money for a college education could've self-taught himself.  Either way, however, we're talking excuses, not actualities.  We can only deal in the present, not the past.  We can't change the fact that so_and_so did not play that much in the past and is now suffering for it, just as we can't change the fact that so_and_so in RL didn't get a college education and now can't find a job.  But are you really going to go ahead and tell them that they screwed themselves and it's their fault?<br /><br />That's not how welfare in RL works.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">They could have the money, but instead chose not to... there is nothing wrong with that choice, except when everyone else is expected to hand that gear to them.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Again, same issue in RL.  What *do* you say to people on welfare who *could've* been college-educated hard-working citizens? Do you tell them to screw off or do you help them? This is the difference between being compassionate and being fair.  A "fair" system would say to those people - you screwed yourselves, too bad.

See, in the old days of EQ, the bazaar did not exist and each class had certain pieces of gear that would SIGNIFICANTLY improve them and which they worked for.  Back in those days, it was not uncommon for someone to spend 20+ hours at a camp and not walk out with anything because someone who did not need the loot won the random rolls.  What's more, many people did not have the time or interest to go /auction in East Commons for hours on ends in order to sell loot they cannot use.  Thus, people eventually got tired of having /random decide their fate.  They implemented the NGB system to make sure that people of a certain class would get the loot they needed the fastest and to prevent people of another class to price-gouge in Ecommons.  This is especially appealing when considered alongside camps such as the frenzied camp in Lower Guk - no one liked seeing a caster walk off with a FBSS while the monk who needed the item had to wait another 10+ hours for it to drop.  People like that *were* considered greedy bastards because they would turn around and sell the loot for a much higher rate to people who had the willingness and time to go auction in Ecommons and then come back and try to get another FBSS.  The key thing here is that NGB is assumed to be the fastest way through which people may attain the loot they needed - back then, selling/trading was DIFFICULT and often not possible for many people, so the fastest and most reliable way to obtain loot is to get into a NGB group and have a priority list - e.g. the person who was here the longest gets the first FBSS, person who came after him gets the second, and so on. (this had problems, obviously, with people not wanting to be sixth on a list but with perma-camped camps such as frenzied in lguk it was the only way)<br /><br />BTW, just out of curiousity, if raid items were NOT nodrop, would you support a DKP system for a raiding guild wherein any class could bid on anything, Laeelin, even if they couldn't use the item?<br /><br /><br /></span></font></td>

BUT it was won by some guy who started bragging how he was going to sell it for 5K to get his third mega-twink a horse. <br /><br />But Hey... you say this was the ultimate in fairness... who am I to argue with you.</span></font></td>

DKP is the only loot system I've seen that rewards players based on time played..... "I've played more than you... I have more DKP.. .so all the good items are MINE" Well some folks have jobs and RL commitments, meaning we can't play 24/7 like some others. "You only play 2 hours a day?? No problem you don't NEED stuff anyway. I play 18 hours a day so I need it ALL". Yep thats the DKP system for you.<br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Without going into decideing if DPK is fair .. That isnt the same as what i'm talking about.. You dont need to spend 50 hours playing in the group before you have a chance on a item, you just need to be in the group when the item drops.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br />It's a nicer way to play but it's NOT fair.<br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"> <br /><br />I dont beleve it is the nicer way either.<br /><br />with NBG you might have one person that gets an upgrade instead of everyone rolling on it... but if you say to use NBG, then you are saying to 4 other people that they dont have a chance get the item... thats not nice.<br /><br />You kown what is nice?<br /><br />person 1) Random for 15<br />person 2) Random for 73<br />person 3) Random for 54<br />person 4) Random for 36<br />person 5) Random for  22<br />you 6) Random for 91<br /><br />/tell person 5 "hey, i see you would equip this, here take it with my compliments."<br /><br />Thats being nice.<br /><br />Not saying:<br /><br />Hey players 1-4, to bad, you dont get this, it's going to person 5 because he would equip it.<br /><br />Granted that it's not normally going to actually be said like that, but if players 1-4 would think to suggest that everyone should have a fair chance for it they will be thought of as loot hungry jerks.</span></font></td>
