         There is a quest associated with him, but I dont think he actually gives any quests himself.  I found this at eqspoilers.com, anyone know where Zevfeer is?  It would be cool if he gave some coterie of night quest.</P><P>This quest is currently unsolved. Quest logs for what is known so far by AgMyles DaGiant:</P><P>Phenic is in the big building with garden out front in Katta Castellum, he in in the upper right side.</P><P><BR>You say, 'Hail, Phenic Dionicas'</P><P>Phenic Dionicas says 'Greetings adventurer. I am Phenic Dionicas, Magistrate of the Loyalist Combine Empire. I hope the [vampyres] did not cause you troubles on your journey here.</P><P>You say, 'what vampyres?'</P><P>Phenic Dionicas says 'Aye, the vampyres of the Coterie of the Eternal Night. I was among the first to ever [discover] the vampyre threat when I was just a young boy freshly initiated into the [Validus Custodus].</P><P>You say, 'what is validus custodus?'</P><P>Phenic Dionicas says 'The Validus Custodus is the army of the Loyalist Empire. It was formerly known as the Tsaph Katta Militia when the city of Katta Castellum was still being erected upon the cliffs that it now stands. As the city grew and the duties of the militia expanded the governors and magistrates of the time met in council and the Validus Custodus was formed. My father Galin Dionicas was elected the first Commander and Chief of the Validus Custodus. Commander Galin was slain in his sleep the very same night that Heratius body was stolen from the graveyard by the vile Coterie of the Eternal Night. Their deeds shall not go unpunished.</P><P>You say, 'what discover?'</P><P>Phenic Dionicas says 'I was on a routine trade route patrol through the tenebrous mountains and the grimling forest when we were attacked by a pack of the vile undead. The creatures that attacked us wore the garments of Shadow Haven merchants and nearly my entire patrol was slain by their claws and fangs. Only [Heratius Grolden] and myself made it back to the safety of Katta Castellum alive and shortly after I was the only survivor of the attack.</P><P>You say, 'who is heratius grolden?'</P><P>Phenic Dionicas says 'Heratius Grolden was a boyhood friend of mine and a brave legionnaire in the Validus Custodus. He was buried with honor in the graveyard of Katta Castellum. Several nights after his burial Heratius' grave had been dug up and his body was missing. I suspect and fear that the Coterie of the Eternal Night returned for him to make him one of their own. I pray to whatever gods are listening that some day we are able to [track down the defilers]!</P><P>You say, 'i will track down the defilers'</P><P>Phenic Dionicas says 'It has been several decades since the first group of vampyres that are responsible for the death of Heratius Grolden were encountered. I have been watching for signs of their origins since that time to little avail. What we do know is that they wore the apparel of merchants from Shadow Haven. How and why they were turned into the bloodsucking creatures they became is still a mystery and shrouded in many rumors. Take this official request form to the merchant records keeper in Shadow Haven and he may be able to provide you with records of any merchant caravans that departed for Katta Castellum within a reasonable time before the attacks and never returned.</P><P>Head to Shadow Haven to the Records Keeper. He is in a building near the bank that is near the cleric guild and hand him the request form and get records and bring them back to Phenic.</P><P>Record Keeper Ajar says 'So you were sent by the Magistrates of Katta Castellum I see. It isn't very often we get requests for records as old as these.' Ajar shuffles through several books on a cluttered shelf and a few minutes later procures the records and begins writing down the requested information. 'Here are the names that have been requested by Magistrate Dionicas. You can assure him when you deliver this record that it is quite accurate.<BR>You gain experience!!</P><P>Give Phenic the records and get Badge.</P><P>Phenic Dionicas says 'Most interesting. One of the names on this list I recognize. The alchemist [Valdanov Zevfeer]. Nathyn Illuminious would know more of Valdanov. Present this badge to Nathyn so that he knows you have been sent by the Magistrates to inquire about this issue and question him about the alchemist.<BR>Your faction standing with Concilium Universus got better.<BR>Your faction standing with Seru got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Heart of Seru got worse.<BR>You gain party experience!!</P><P>You say, 'who is valdanov zevfeer?'</P><P>Phenic Dionicas says 'Valdanov Zevfeer was a traveling alchemist and magical reagent peddler that used to occasionally visit Katta Castellum. At one point before the initial vampyre attacks he decided to remain in Katta Castellum for a while with the wealthy Katta citizen Nathyn Illuminious. Apparently that decision saved his life as according to the records you have provided the caravan he arrived with never completed the return trip to Shadow Haven. That is as much as I know about the individual as he primarily kept to himself during his stay here.</P><P>Nathyn is upstairs in his house. Sometimes rare, sometimes not. But he is buggy none the less. Hand him your badge then talk to him. Sometimes you have to say it a few times, but at any rate be quick.</P><P>You say, 'Hail, Nathyn Illuminious'</P><P>Nathyn Illuminious says 'I do not believe that I invited you to enter my home. If this is not a visit concerning a pressing issue that may peak my concern then please remove yourself from these premises. I am a very busy man and have no time to waste on the concerns of commoners. </P><P>Nathyn Illuminious says 'Phenic has given you permission to investigate a matter on his behalf? Hmph! Well, I suppose I will respect the powers of his station and answer your inquiries to the best of my knowledge. <BR>You gain experience!!</P><P>You say, 'who is Valdanov Zevfeer?'</P><P>Nathyn Illuminious says 'Valdanov Zevfeer was a talented alchemist from Shadow Haven with whom I had many dealings. He would bring me components for my enchantment research from all the various environments here on Luclin. Since Valdanov had been such a valuable aid to me in the past I decided to return the favor and allowed him residence within my abode and helped to further fund his research as long as he assisted me in my own enchantment studies. He has since left to continue to pursue his own interests and I have not heard from him in [quite some time]. </P><P>You say, 'why not quite some time?'</P><P>Nathyn Illuminious says 'Valdanov departed many years ago. He had become dangerously obsessive with his research of vampyre physiology and the effects of various alchemical formulae on the undead creatures. His obsession began when a traveler arrived in Katta Castellum speaking of a Vah Shir vampyre. Valdanov began leaving the safety of the city frequently in search of this undead Vah Shir and for questionable alchemical reagents with which he insisted on testing on [captured vampyres] being studied by the Magus Conlegium. </P><P>You say, 'what captured vampyres?'</P><P>Nathyn IIIuminious says 'After an unfortunate mishap with an escaped vampyre in the city the Magus Conlegium and the Validus Custodus declared that no vampyres shall ever again enter the city of Katta Castellum and only their ashes or blood may be studied under the careful observation of the Magus Conlegium. I am very sorry but I have some pressing business I must attend to and I'm afraid I have nothing more to offer. You may take this information back to Magistrate Phenic as he has requested.</P><P>Get the information and return in Phenic, get order for Legionaire Falion. He will be outside in the Tenebrous mnts at the gate. May have to wait for his shift.</P><P>You say, 'Hail, Phenic Dionicas'</P><P>Phenic Dionicas says 'So Valdanov had an interest in a Vah Shir vampyre?!! Perhaps we should seek out this Vah Shir and find more clues. Take these orders to Legionnaire Falion during his next shift at the Tenebrous Mountains Gate, he will question any travelers that pass by about this mysterious Vah Shir. Should you locate the Vah Shir Vampyre attempt to present him with your Badge of Service for questioning, he just may agree to cooperate rather than anger the Validus Custodus.<BR>Your faction standing with Concilium Universus got better.<BR>Your faction standing with Seru got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Heart of Seru got worse.<BR>You gain experience!!</P><P><BR>You say, 'Hail, Legionnaire Falion</P><P>Legionnaire Falion says 'A Vah Shir vampyre!! Isn't that disturbing! How are you supposed to spot its pale skin under all that fur! Come to think of it I've heard that a strange Vah Shir has occasionally been spotted heading towards the villages of the Coterie of the Eternal Night here in the Tenebrous Mountains. This may be the Vah Shir you are seeking. I will be sure to question any arriving travelers if they have spotted him.<BR>Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got better.<BR>Your faction standing with Katta Castellum Citizens got better.<BR>Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got better.<BR>Your faction standing with Nathyn Illuminious got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Coterie of the Eternal Night got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Seru got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Hand of Seru got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Hand Legionnaries got worse.<BR>You gain party experience!!</P><P>Kerzar is a 30 min spawn I THINK. He is usually found near the big Corterie fort but roams between them. After you hand him your badge he attacks. Beat him down till he talks. After he talks you will be ambushed. You should have they quest key at this point and no need to kill the Generals that ambush you. Just run West back to town.</P><P>You say, 'Hail, Kerzar Clawtore'</P><P>Kerzar Clawtore glares with eyes that seem to pierce through you like fiery daggers. 'Run while you can weakling! My appetite grows stronger with the presence of your mortal scent!'</P><P>Kerzar Clawtore says 'You've been sent by the Validus Custodus to question me!! You mortals are more foolish than I had presumed! The only information I have for you is the fact that you are about to face your death!!<BR>You gain party experience!!<BR>Kerzar Clawtore roars flashing glistening fangs that are sharper and longer than the average Vah Shirs!<BR>Kerzar Clawtore hits YOU for 79 points of damage.<BR>Kerzar Clawtore hits YOU for 121 points of damage.</P><P>You say, 'Hail, Kerzar Clawtore'</P><P>Kerzar Clawtore says 'What knowledge do I have that the Validus Custodus is so eager to obtain? If you spare me I assure you I will answer truthfully.</P><P>You say, 'who is Valdanov Zevfeer?'</P><P>Kerzar Clawtore says 'I have not seen Valdanov Zevfeer in many years. He came to me once when I was still newly reborn wanting to extract a vial of my blood. When I refused he attacked me and extracted it against my will. I was still new and unfamiliar with my vampyric powers, Valdanovs [abilities] were far more developed than my own.</P><P>You say, 'what abilities?'</P><P>Kerzar Clawtore says 'His vampyric abilities of course. Valdanov had either been reborn in undeath far before myself or had a powerful mentor and the time and facilities in which to train. I did my best to resist his attack but I was still subdued by his superior skills and strength. He dropped this key in the struggle. I have no use for it, consider it yours. I must be going before I'm seen by the others. Oh no! It's too late! We've been spotted! May you continue your investigations in the afterlife!</P><P>Kerzar Clawtore rapidly transforms into swirling mist indistinguishable from the wind swept mountain fog as other forms begin to solidify from the fog nearby.<BR>a coterie general hisses revealing menacing fangs and lunges ferociously at its prey!</P><P>Go to Nathyn's house downstairs right hand side. There is a hidden wall with a chest in it. Place your key in the chest and a Shade will spawn. Kill it and get book and belt.</P><P>You gain party experience!!<BR>Private Sentinel Frieza says 'Fool!! You know not what you have released upon us!! Nathyn will have your heads for this!!<BR>Private Sentinel Tozza says 'Fool!! You know not what you have released upon us!!

'This investigation is getting more and more baffling the further we delve. Among other things, I am wondering if the shade that was imprisoned in the chest is the same that was providing Valdanov with the blood for his research. Take the belt that the shade was wearing with these instructions to Governor Lathin at the Magus Conlegium. In the meantime I will pay a visit to Nathyn Illuminious.<BR>Your faction standing with Concilium Universus got better.<BR>Your faction standing with Seru got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Heart of Seru got worse.<BR>You gain party experience!!</P><P>Take the Orders and the Belt to Lathin. He is in the Magus house 3rd floor.</P><P>You say, 'Hail, Lathin Firetree'</P><P>Lathin Firetree says 'Well met brave Wood Elf. I am Lathin Firetree, Governor of Wizardry here at the Magus Conlegium. I have an abundance of research and experimentation to attend to so unless you have an issue of importance to present or are going to assist me with the research I must get back to my studies.</P><P>Lathin Firetree says 'I require the instructions from Phenic and the Autarkic Shade Lord Belt.</P><P>Lathin Firetree says 'Phenic wishes me to summon the Shade that is the owner of this belt for questioning. That is quite a dangerous request but it is not uncommon of Phenic to be a risk taker when it comes to his plots against the Coterie of the Eternal Night. Take this sketch and find a skilled potter to craft you a likeness of a shade from a large block of clay as a focus item for the ritual. When you have the unfired figurine fire it in a kiln with this special glaze on a High Quality Firing Sheet and return to me.<BR>Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got better.<BR>Your faction standing with Katta Castellum Citizens got better.<BR>Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got better.<BR>Your faction standing with Seru got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Hand of Seru got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with Hand Legionnaries got worse.<BR>You gain party experience!!</P><P>You will need a potter to make the unfired figurine. A potter with 165 skill failed a few times but you don't loose the sketch on failure and skill can go up. YOU must fastion the fired figurine in the kiln, for the result is no drop. You will not fail.</P><P>Agmyles has fashioned a Unfired Shade Summoning Figurine.<BR>You have fashioned the items together to create something new!</P><P>Give the Fired figurine to Lathin and let the show begin.</P><P>Lathin Firetree says 'Excellent, this figurine will work wonderfully. A group of my best summoners is gathering on the first floor at the largest of the summoning circles to call forth the shade.

If you have the Shade Summmoning Figurine we can begin.</P><P>Incantator Jak Masric begins to cast a spell.</P><P>Theurgus Ajeea Polaja begins to radiate.</P><P>Theurgus Ajeea Polaja says 'Perfect.

Why have you pulled back to this forsaken castellum? Do you fear that I will seek vengeance on Nathyn Illuminious and the city that shelters him for my years of captivity here? Or do you seek something more dangerous, knowledge of the dark path of shadows?</P><P>Incantator Jak Masric says 'We neither fear you nor seek to be drawn into your dark ways, Lord Sfarosh. You will provide us some information as demanded by the Magistrates of the Loyalist Empire. The questions are simple, answer quickly and the sooner you shall be freed from this summoning. What is your history with the alchemist Valdanov Zevfeer?</P><P>Autarkic Lord Sfarosh says 'A simple question indeed. I simply supplied him with Akhevan blood for his experimentation, that is all. The Order of Autarkic Umbrage is no friend of the Akheva and it was possible that his research could uncover some useful information for my order. Valdanovs own motivation for his experimentation was none of my concern, but the outcome is quite fascinating I must admit.</P><P>Praecantor Selis Dawneyes says 'So it seems you are aware of the outcome of his hidden experimentation. Care to enlighten us as to what that outcome was?</P><P>Autarkic Lord Sfarosh says 'I am amazed at how little you fleshlings know of what occurs within the very walls of your own castellum. It is known by my Order that Akhevan blood has strange mutagenic effects on the bodies of non-akheves if introduced to their circulatory systems. The process by which the Shadow Tegi are infused with the blood is quite complicated and painful but I would deduce that a vampyre like Valdanov merely had to ingest the blood for the mutagenic agents to effect his physiology, causing the permenent change into what I believe you call a Vampyre Volatilis. I have no dealings with Valdanov since his mutation as I was imprisoned in Nathyns mansion until freed by these foolish fleshings.</P><P>Theurgus Ajeea Polaja says 'How was it that you came to be imprisoned in the mansion of Nathyn Illuminious?</P><P>Autarkic Lord Sfarosh says 'I was paying a visit to Valdanov with more Akhevan blood, not knowing he had already been banished by Nathyn from Katta Castellum for becoming the monster that he became. I must admit, Nathyn is a powerful and cunning creature. He was prepared for my arrival, captured me with his sorceries, and imprisoned me in that enchanted chest. I was not offered an explanation, nor do I know how he discovered my dealings with Valdanov, I assume he obtained that knowledge from questioning Valdanov about his mutation.</P><P>Autarkic Lord Sfarosh says 'It seems some allies are arriving! Foolish fleshlings, run while you have the chance!</P><P>Praecantor Selis Dawneyes says 'Ajeea! What's happened?! I sense there are dark powers at work here!</P><P>Incantator Jak Masric says 'The circle of containment is breaking down without Ajeea! Prepare yourselves!</P><P>Autarkic Lord Sfarosh says 'Your feeble fleshling magic has failed you! Your souls shall be slaves of the Order of Autarkic Umbrage!</P><P>Praecantor Selis Dawneyes rushes to Ajeea, lifts her comotose body with a magical force and they both vanish is a flash of light.</P><P>Incantator Jak Masric says 'Eliminate the shades! Selis and I will get Ajeea to safety and concentrate on a ward to prevent any further intrusion and stifle the shades power! Seek me out and bring me the robes of these shades when they have been slain so that we may research placing a more permanent ward against such creatures on the Conlegium.</P><P>Autarkic Lord Sfarosh begins to cast a spell.<BR>You feel your skin burn as poison seeps through your skin. You have taken 160 points of damage.</P><P>Autarkic Lord Sfarosh says 'Attempt to slay me if you so desire, and if you succeed it matters not. I will return as I am a creature of shadows and shadows never die, merely slumber!</P><P>Kill the shades and you MUST loot all 4 the robes for your Magus Token. A decent group can kill these.
