        <hr noshade size="1">
        
        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">I'm sure you've heard this a million times, but I figured I would put my two cents in.  I've played this game for over two years and am currently burned out.  The final straw was the epic weapon.  You see my primary is a necro and my love for him has diminished.  Mainly because I've had my play style radically changed.  Lately I've seen several changes being put into the game that we were told were "as designed" and wouldn't be fixed.  Yet now they are.  Making invulnerability truly so being one of them.  This gives me a small hope and so I write my frustrations in that things may change and I may enjoy the game again. </P><P>First off, VI truly needs to put out what each class is.  What is the "vision" of each class?  If we knew that, we could then accept what we are.  As it stands, Necros know what they were and what they were changed to.</P><P>You see, there was a time I was respected, highly desired, and felt that I was the evil, horrid, bringer of death.  My class was hated because it choose to bring things back from the dead to fight for me and I choose evil dark power over being loved.  The dark magic appealled to me.  Granted I was limited in giving buffs, or much help to others other than being a killing machine.  But that was then.</P><P>It was my understanding that pure casters sacrifice defensive for massive offensive and that melees the opposite.  However, this no longer holds true 50+ and very true 55+.  Key word on massive.</P><P>But I'm digressing.  Let's first discuss the epic weapons and issues with necros.  Everyone likes to bring up necros being punished for their solo power.</P><P>Shaman - have an unlimited destructive power with splurt-like dot + root + 55 pet + slow + stacks with all their dots.  I have witnessed a 60 shaman solo a 20K hp mob in siren's grotto that which a necro could never solo.  Worse their pet lived the entire time.  Also, will overwrite splurt so necro is reduced with this item present.<BR>    - Overall, makes sense in a way as Shaman are a DOT class.  Would make more sense were effect to be their highest slow spell.  I.E. weapon frees up a spell slot.  As it stands, adds a spell they never had.  So, good</P><P>Enchanter - a huge mana saver.  Now can freely speed buff and conserve mana for other duties.  No negative effect to necro<BR>    - Overall, makes sense as enchanters are buffer and frees a spell slot.</P><P>Magician - an insane pet.  Also, only class that always has their epic up as it's a spell.  Negative effect to necro is showing him what a pathetic pet class he is.<BR>    - Overall, awesome.  Literally doubles classes power.</P><P>Cleric - a huge mana\time saver.  Everyone in game bends over backwards to help every cleric get this.  Literally this one item changes the possible strategies for raids.  Negative effect to necro is knowing necro could rez but comes with a cost NO other class pays to use.<BR>     - Overall, no other item changes gameplay to the extent this does.  Raid failed?  click click click click.  Try again in less than 15 minutes.  Makes clerics much less bothered helping fellow players.</P><P>Druid - a new dot that stacks with all their others.  Negative is that it will overwrite necro's darkness and lasts twice as long.<BR>     Overall, helpful.  7 sec cast time still requires ensnare to be loaded, but 3 minute duration ensures it won't wear off</P><P>Wizard - sad sad effect.  Does nothing to help class by a margin all other epics do to their respective classes.<BR>     Overall, the shield is nice, the mana regen a perk, but really does nothing truly spectacular.  Truly tied for worse effect epic wise.</P><P>Necro - effect is level 49 spell with longer cast time. <BR>     Overall, not a new spell.  All other effects listed are new spells other than cleric but which help.  Yes this is mana free, but a 7 second cast time is laughable.  Then there is the damage of our 49 darkness and not our 59.</P><P>Sigh.  All the depression comes back.</P><P>The necro pants which have the 49 pet buff and not the 55.</P><P>The sk upgrades which makes the sk a better necro than a necro.  I'm all for all class improvements, but a hybrid can have special abilities to make them unique, but they shouldn't be better than their parent.<BR>    - can cast lifetap faster<BR>    - has upgraded feign<BR>    - can take a hit</P><P>The 53, 55, 59 incorrect level pet summon problem<BR>    - all pets prior to 53 have summoning level of lowest pet possible is the highest pet possible of the previous pet spell</P><P>The lifespan issue of 53, 55, and 59 pets: all pets prior could be kept alive by necro.  Now have too few hps that pet doesn't live longer than 15 seconds compared to 45 seconds previously</P><P>The lack of locations selling coffins</P><P>The sheer cost of 59 pet vs it not owning all previous pets.  Our best pet should be just that.  Best.  Should spank all prior to it.  It doesn't.</P><P>The entire undead issue.  Undead only fear/charm spells exist and yet normal fear/charm work just as well.  No real reason to load those spells.  If this one change were made, necro pets would suddenly become more useful on raids as unfearable except to undead fear.</P><P>The whole lich issue.  Lich was changed to give more mana.  PVP coding resulted in lich, lifetaps, and healing dots only healing 60%.  A 320 DD lifetap only heals 260.  So, yes, necros aren't "paying" the full price for lich, but we sure aren't able to heal for full either.</P><P>Magicians having the best DOT in the game - i.e. shortest DOT (30 sec) with low aggro doing 1K damage</P><P>The issue of Sacrifice- does anyone else have to pay the huge cost necros do?  Even the highest wizard spell only costs 25pp a pop.  Yet necros must pay huge plat & inventory slots to summon corpse until 57.  Necros are only class where one spell drops off of only one mob.  Necros are only class told your mana is better served given to someone else, but the best you ever get is a 1/3 ratio?  I'm worth 625 mana to a cleric.  And then there is the whole rez issue.  I could understand if sacrifice was needed once to make a no drop stone which is needed to cast rez spell, but not used up.  Do Paladins or Clerics require someone else to die?  No.  They just have to med for 5 minutes to get the mana to do it.  Yet necros are required to take away a minimum of 4 hours of someone elses playtime just to give it back to another?  Or, worse, 4 hours of playtime = 1000 mana?  Or a nuke we can only use once every 15 minutes at level 60???</P><P>The whole 50+ spell lineup.  Of the 40 spells to choose from only 9 are worthwhile.  Also, spell costs go UP, and yet unlike all previous levels, the amount of mana pool does not.</P><P>50 - self only invis undead:  super..great.  Yet those who can see through it still can.  So the point is....</P><P>51 - <BR>dread of night - yippee.  Higher mana cost for undead only fear.  Fear still works just as well.<BR>E-bolt - yeah.  another shaman pass-me-down with the highest taunt of all.  usefull soloing non summoning mobs<BR>sacrifice - see above<BR>Splurt - truly loved because low mana cost, low taunt although a waste unless mob lives for over a minute</P><P>52<BR>Defoliation - awesome DD on those it works on<BR>Manaskin - helpful but expensive manawise to cast<BR>Plague - another handmedown.  Slow, taunting, useful<BR>Scent of Terris - absolutely a waste.  Never sticks to that which needs it</P><P>53<BR>Annul magic - nice<BR>Convergence - see above<BR>Enstill - shrug, root is cheaper and faster<BR>Minion of Shadows - other than lack of hps and wrong summoning levels..nice</P><P>54<BR>Deflux - wow.  An upgrade to a spell that's faster casting.  just WOW.<BR>Shadowbond - helpful other than won't work on those under 45.<BR>Shield of magi - nice<BR>thrall of bones - not sure what I couldn't charm with 49 beguile that I can with this.  Does potentially last longer.  Would be nice to know if necros should have high or low charisma.</P><P>55<BR>Augmentation of death - pet buff..good<BR>Chill bones - uhm.  11 levels later and we get a cold DD that does the same damage.  You do know that necros are the worst at DD?<BR>Infusion - see above<BR>Levant - pathetic.  Only works at night.  No one else has time of day based spells.  Yes, charge up time, zone restrictions, recast restrictions, but NO ONE else has time of day.  USELESS and 500 mana too.  sheesh<BR>Skin of the shadow - LOL.  Even more pathetic.  Another time of day issue.  Uhm...are necro's vampires?  </P><P>56<BR>Cessation of Cor - finally an upgraded DOT which cost only 40 more mana, is fairly short and does helpful debuffs.  But for 12 levels of waiting it is only 31% better and 1 second faster casting.<BR>Sedulous Subversion - wow. 400 of mine = 150 another.  Pathetic.<BR>Servant of Bones - nice pet other than issues mentioned<BR>Trepidation - uhm 200 mana for fear?  Bleh.  Only lasts 36 seconds.  Why bother</P><P>57<BR>Conjure Corpse - ahhhh. stackable components.  75pp a pop. sigh<BR>Exile undead - ahhh.  awesome specific nuke.  took forever to obtain though.<BR>Vexing Mordania - ahhh.  healing dot. And the only dot that is cheaper to cast than it's predecessor.  Only 34% better than previous though for 8 levels of waiting.</P><P>58<BR>Pyrocuror - sigh. 400 mana. 150 more mana after 9 levels of work.  At least it's 41% better than it's predecessor but a second longer to cast.  Takes a long time too.<BR>Quivering veil of Xarn - LOL.  Oh yeah.  another vampire spell.  I'm invunerable...who hoo..oh wait..the sun...ahhhh<BR>Immobilize - wow 60 sec root.  Uhm.  I'll stick to root.  it's cheaper and faster</P><P>59<BR>Devouring darkness - sigh.  Look 10 incredibly long levels to gain a spell that is ONE second faster casting at 6 seconds and is only 28% better for 100 more mana.  Oh, but it lasts 20 seconds less.  A spell used mainly for it's snare effect.  Dooming is the spell of choic as it only takes 2.5 secs to cast and lasts only 6 seconds shorter than the 49 and is 12 seconds longer than the 59.  Sigh<BR>Emissary of Thule - you would think this would kick ass.  650 mana..ouch<BR>Touch of Night - wow.  back to the 6 second lifetap.  MMM.  Look double the mana and double the cast time for near the same heal/damage/time as casting 2 defluxes.  Thanks..I'll stick with deflux.  I'm casting to heal, not do damage.  Interruptions suck and 6 seconds is an eternity</P><P>60 - wow...here we are.  The end of the road and<BR>Arch lich - used to have faction adjustment but same ratio as lich..so assumed that was the perk.  Guess we were wrong.  Sticking with demi lich as it at least has a better ratio<BR>Banishment of shadows - oh goodie...get to poof an undead mob.  what fun.  for 750 mana too.  yippie.<BR>Demi Lich - wow...2 liches in one spell area<BR>Enslave death -   WOW.  500 mana for 30 seconds.  Suxor<BR>Trucidation - gotta love a nuke with a 15 minute recast time.  Anyone else have this?  Anyone?  anyone?</P><P>That's the run down of what necros think.  Then to point out more, here's a summary of a few issues.</P><P>Necro's DD - not lifetap or restricted<BR>lvl/dmg/mana<BR>24/160/100<BR>34/220/130<BR>44/500/210 - 6 sec cast/ 12 sec recast<BR>55/500/210 - 6 sec cast/ 12 sec recast<BR>Really goes to pot 50+ doesn't it?</P><P>Only 2 Dot upgrades are truly worth the wait</P><P>Deflux is the only lifetap longed for because of it's cast time.</P><P>When comparing a necro going full tilt with 7 DOTs at 60 is only 45% better than a 50 necro with the previous versions of those dots, one thinks all is well.  But, when the necro only goes with necro only DOTs it drops to 29%.  The best upgrades are shaman DOTS.  The worst part is the 50 necro could cast all of them twice and the 60 necro would be nearly out of mana just once.  Then, of course, is the fact that mobs 50+ can summon, so no necro can truly do this.  </P><P>Removing level restrictions in a duel, the tools a 60 necro is given would not enable him to STOMP the 50.  Other than wasting a gem on trucidation that is.</P><P>Then there is the fact that the Shaman has the most damaging DOT of all and the Magician has only one DOT and it is the best of all.</P><P>So, that leaves me sitting here saddened.  What is the necro?  What does he do 50+?  Why does he become utility 50+?  </P><P>I loved this game.  I loved killing things and using skills to accomplish feats of impressiveness.</P><P>I hate giving away my mana.  I hate being uniquely punished.  I hate necro-envy due to misconceptions.  I hate not being supported by VI.</P><P>Is this not a class that says HIGH DIFFICULTY when you start it?<BR>Doesn't risk = reward?  <BR>Why should I be sooo far behind Magicians?<BR>What makes my pet unique?<BR>Why am I so hated if I'm not sooo powerful? I chose evil because the end justifies the means.  I was once, but this was removed.<BR>Why so few 55+ necros actively playing?<BR>Why is it suggested I'm a vampire due to time of day spell restrictions?</P><P>All I'm saying is that other serious competition for my time and money are approaching.  Class balance discussion were started MONTHS ago and nothing has been done in regards to necro.</P><P>Okay, other than upping the drop in Sky for epic.<BR>And voice graft.</P><P>Sigh.  I just want to be the evil walking plague of death.</P><P>Some answers.</P><P>Some feedback.</P><P>Some hope.</P><P>Here's hoping</P><P><BR> </font></td>

First, if they decide to change nothing, or give us more half assed "group friendly" spells and change nothing else, then my necro is retired permanently. <BR>Second if they actually do something to give us back the power we once had (Id be happy if they upped the pets hp and made it even slightly comparable to Mage pets) then I will start to play my necro again.</P><P>Until one of those things happen my necro is now simply an agent to twink my Warrior.

Set the 53 pet up for backstabs in a group, it's fun :).  The 56 monk is pretty impressive with the 61 damage melees even if it only has 1k of hp :).  It also won't kill ya to ask for people to buff your pet.  The 59 pet has skill level issues, although you do really have to consider how much it tears things apart with Mardu and AoD... Our undead only fears tend to be faster casts than our normal day-time ones an have a slightly better resist modifier I believe.  We also don't get any normal charms so undead charms are pretty useful (I know I've used Enslave Death a few times because people aren't paying attention).</P><P>Druids were actually the first class to get night-only spells as a sidenote.  As it does fit for us.  Levant is a highly useful ability (can ferry yourself across sg and a few other places).  No other class gets fixed duration invisibilities for undead and living.</P><P>Trucidation isn't meant to be a standard nuke at all (why I feel it really should be no resist graded considering it's cost).  It has potential to be very useful on high hp mobs.</P><P>Trepidation lasts one tick less than Invoke Fear at maximum duration, but has a 15 resist bonus, which is very significant, and means it will tend to actually last longer than invoke or at least land at all.</P><P>The Lich issue is odd definantively, I use Arch when I really don't need to be converting all that hp into mana, but it's still just a novelty.</P><P>The Blight be upon ye.<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Wow.  Thanks for all the praise.  If anyone is going to the fan festival, feel free to print this out and confront them.  </P><P>I wasn't aware Druids had a night time only spell.  What would that be?</P><P>Our 53 & 56 pets have fewer hps than shaman pets.  We don't get upgrade pet only heals and the necro loses the ability to keep his pet alive.  Yes /pet no taunt is mandatory.  But we were a pet tanking class and we lose that ability.  We had a disposable tank that could buy a few seconds of time if things went bad.  Now 53 + 56 pets buy us 10 secs max IF the cleric buffed him.  The 59 has very few more hps than the 49.  It bothers me to see a shaman pet live longer than my pet, specialty or not.</P><P>My greavances with undead fear/charm is the fact that fear/charm work also.  What is the point of specialty spells?  They are undead and should require the specialty spells.  Here is an oppurtunity to give power to the undead hunters in some areas.  Undead aren't everywhere, but this would make our pets unfearable/uncharmable.</P><P>And you are mistaken.  Several classes get fixed duration invis, undead or not.  Druid, cleric, and wizards come to mind.</P><P>Trucidation is the only nuke anywhere with a 15 minute recast.  No one has this limitation.  I looked.  No one else has a nuke which requires 4 hours of someone else's gametime.  And this is our final reward at 60.  Feels like more of a slap in the face.</P><P>Sorry, but I just got sick of exploiting the game so I could use my spells.  In other words, once someone maxxed xp in level 60 would attack guards and die and die till 59.  Then I would sacrifice them 7 times and the rest of their corpses would be rezzed with the rez stick.  Ding 60 again with xp to earn again.</P><P>Nobody else has to do this.  It doesn't make sense and just feels like class dislike.</P><P>I would love if our duck stick summoned ghoul of death.  Or a summon corpse/rez spell with no component needed.  Or a pet buff from hell.  Anything which actually added value to our class.</P><P>As it stands.  I'm still watching from the sidelines waiting to see a point to play again.  Because it sure isn't going on raids to nuke big once every 15 minutes.  To be the worst pure nuking caster.  To be the class who's undead pet goes running in fear and get's munched.  To be standing on top of days and days played for the reward of the title</P><P>Exxon mana pump - full service.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

It's a little long, I really hope someone at Verant actually takes the time to read it completely, and most important, you left out any ideas as to how these should be fixed, alot of what you have in there shows some obvious areas to help fix these problems, but remember, this is Verant, sometimes you have to lead the bull by the nose and give them the answers they haven't been able to come up with themselves :)</P><P><BR>Kiluudar Ravenwind  60 Warlock,  Fennin Ro,   T'kagi Ro</P><P>Edited by - Kiluudar on 05/22/2001  21:58:02<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
