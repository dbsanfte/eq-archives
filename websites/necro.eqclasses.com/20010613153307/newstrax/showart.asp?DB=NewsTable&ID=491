I've popped by with a bit o news for you all.<BR><BR>In Development:<BR><BR>We're finally starting to get back on a regular biweekly patch schedule. Here are the things we are currently working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:<BR><BR>Loot rules in the Warrens: We plan to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be eliminating several ways around the current "Trivial Combat Code" as well as looking at the problem of "spell twinking" in regards to the loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.<BR><BR><BR>Stonebrunt Mountains: The next "free" zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.<BR><BR><BR>Dungeon Touchups/Revamps: We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.<BR><BR><BR>Big Changes Planned for PvP: We've had a number of meetings lately to plan changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually be going up are still to be announced.<BR><BR><BR>Continued UI Enhancements: A number of things are planned, from allowing people the ability to buy stacks of items at one time, to improving the way things look on the screen.<BR><BR><BR>3D Engine Enhancements: One of the first things up is the enhancement of the engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the "moving stair step" visual artifact that you see in distant places where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance will be greatly improved. Update: This is actually now implemented however is not yet bug- free. You can take a look at the new capabilities by setting VideoModeBitsPerPixel=32 in your EQClient.ini. Note: If your card doesn't support 32 bits per pixel, you will probably crash. Also, your Deity Specific Quests: We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works.<BR><BR><BR>The History Unfolds: Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history and the future of the world will be made known.<BR><BR><BR>Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants: We're going to continue adding more quests and flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races' territories.<BR><BR><BR>New NPC Return Policy: Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the "Thank You!" message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<BR><BR><BR>Class Balance Discussions: Some recent changes have been introduced as a result of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback as we see fit.<BR><BR><BR>Velious Magic Resistance: In an effort to further balance the SoV expansion, we're taking another look at the unnaturally high magic resistance of Velious mobs. We'll evaluate this on a zone by zone basis and make changes to better balance out the risk vs. reward in the zones for both melee and caster player characters. <BR>We'll fire off more updates as we have information available for release. Until then, enjoy EQ!<BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team<BR><br></p></td><tr><tr><td background="img/purpback.gif"><img src="img/purpback.gif" width=1 height=10></td>
