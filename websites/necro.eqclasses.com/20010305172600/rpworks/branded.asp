      <p style="word-spacing: 0px; margin: 0px" align="left">I
      wish to tell you this tale of my hardships. Not of life, not of death, but
      the painful threshold between that of life and death stand. Clinging to
      life but pulled away by death. A pain that breaks the spirit, a pain that
      takes the will to live away. Wanting to die, but wanting to live, not
      knowing which would be less painful. I have suffered through pain of this
      magnitude. Yet, somehow, refusing to give in. Innoruuk would not take such
      weaklings.<br>
      <br>
      I had been exploring one fine eve, testing out my newfound spells
      andpowers. I hadn't tried them out and wished to find a somewhat decent
      place to test them. For some unforeseen reason I chose the borderline
      between the West Commonlands and Kithicor Woods. Little did I know that
      this decision was the worst I could have made. Though I was not in
      Kithicor, I was still caught.<br>
      <br>
      I was resting when I got hit. I can't quite remember the whole thing. I
      can remember a raw pain that I felt in the back of my head. At that point,
      all I could see was red. After I had regained my senses, I was hit again,
      and was knocked unconscious.<br>
      <br>
      I awoke on a pile of hay in a dark, dank, windowless dungeon cell. Then, I
      realized what had happened. I was in Rivervale. I was frightened for the
      first few moments, unsure of what to do. But, I snapped back into my
      senses and tried to think of a way out.<br>
      <br>
      I sat down and memorized Gate. I stood up and began to chant the words,
      but it was useless. After the shimmering lights had subsided I realized I
      was only a few feet farther than my previous position. I was bound in this
      cell, it must have happened while I was unconscious.<br>
      <br>
      A guard, after seeing my attempt of escape, came into the cell and threw
      me across the room. I was thrown with such a force that I could have sworn
      I heard my back shatter. In reality it didn't, but it felt as though it
      was in pieces on the floor.<br>
      <br>
      I was alone again, I thought. I scolded myself for getting thrown, but it
      was the least of my worries. From what I saw, there was no escape, as well
      as any food or water. I was beginning to panic, I wanted out, and I wanted
      out now. I had never been caught for anything, and this would be the last.
      I paced and thought until I nearly went mad. During the nights, I'd lay
      down and stare at the ceiling, wishing I were there instead of here,
      anywhere else but here. After three days, I ran out of stocked food and
      water. The first day of this starvation was fine. The second day, I felt
      my body weaken. The third, I felt my stomach eating itself. I shook and
      couldn't stand without the walls. No matter which shields I cast on
      myself, or how often I cast them, I still grew weakand lost stamina. Then
      my vision blurred, and it became hard to think clearly.<br>
      <br>
      I heard a giant rat scurry across the room and nibble at the moldy hay in
      the corner. I lunged to it, not sure of what had come over me. Holding it
      in my hands I chanted the words to Siphon Life and killed the rodent. I
      ate the meat and drank the blood. That would keep me at ease for a while,
      I thought. As I turned and looked at the sorry remains of what I had done,
      I grew sick. I didn't see another scurry into the cell after that. The
      next day, the pain grew and I became more famished and dehydrated than
      before.<br>
      <br>
      It hurt so much. With the strength of which I had, I screamed. A scream
      that shattered the ears with a high pitched squeal. I couldn't stop. My
      pain was too extreme. Then, when my throat became parched and I couldn't
      scream anymore, I shrank into the corner and cried. I cried until I
      couldn't cry those long sobs anymore. Then, I whimpered. I was shaky and
      couldn't think. Soon after I screamed again, they weren't as before
      though, they weren't high pitched, they were loud and crackling.<br>
      <br>
      Then my vision left me, and I was blind to the world of this cell,
      believing to this being my fate I fell to my knees and was silent.<br>
      <br>
      The next thing I remembered was when I came around or rather woke. My arms
      and legs were tied to one of the cold, stone dungeon walls. I used all of
      my remaining strength to lift my head and look around, but it was of no
      use, my vision was too blurred.<br>
      <br>
      I felt a sudden slice of pain ripping through my cheek and I cried out in
      pain. Then I felt something oozing out of the wound, it was bleeding bad
      and I couldn't do anything to stop it. I heard the sound of a whip
      cracking. It sliced through my robe and cut deep into my skin. This
      continued I knew, until I finally cried. This became my first<br>
      realization of how weak I truly was.<br>
      <br>
      Then, they fed me. I don't know why, but they fed me well. They took me
      back to my cell to get sleep, and I slept well, despite my bleeding
      wounds. But, it was a dreamless sleep. I was too tired to dream. But I
      failed to hear the little monsters chanting their spells, and to hear the
      portal of my transport opening, for when I woke I was no longer where I
      was before. When I woke I didn't know whether it was night or day, nor did
      it matter, I knew that my torture would end soon at my death.<br>
      <br>
      I had found a bowl of cold water with a white cloth floating in it, I
      decided to wash my wounds. I gently blotted the blood away and looked at
      the bowl. The water had been completely masked red from my blood.
      Astonished, I looked up. That's when I realized I was no longer in the
      surrounding of Rivervale, but Qeynos. I looked at ever corner and saw,
      crouched against the wall, a fellow Teir'Dal.<br>
      <br>
      When he looked at me, I could see in his eyes that he too had been
      starved, beaten and was going mad. He looked at me, but couldn't see me. I
      knew what pain he was suffering. I looked through my bag and found no sign
      of food or water. He started to cry. I felt for him. I was there and would
      soon be there. I looked at his armor and weapon andguessed he, at one time
      or another had been a great warrior. Yet, he<br>
      hadn't the strength to raise his sword and kill the small scrawny rodents.<br>
      <br>
      I saw a rat and chanted Siphon Life once more. I killed it and fed the
      ripped off meat to the warrior. He began to regain strength with ever bit
      I gave him. I killed ever rat I could and split the pieces between the
      both of us and soon after he fell asleep.<br>
      <br>
      I studied the dungeon walls, looking for one way to get out. I felt the
      walls for weak spots and sure enough, I found a corner of the room where
      loose bricks would slide. I gasped and put the brick back in. A few
      moments later I was tied again and beaten, in the cell, this time by a
      human.<br>
      <br>
      My cries of pain woke the warrior, and I was released. I immediately fell
      to the floor and collapsed. Suddenly, I regained my sense and felt the
      cold wetness of a washcloth on my bleeding back. It was a somewhat gentle
      touch. &quot;Just rest&quot;, said the warrior, in a surprisingly kind
      voice. I rested my head back down on the hay, and groaned.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;They shall pay for their foolishness, I shall kill them all&quot; I
      whimpered<br>
      <br>
      &quot; Yes&quot; replied the warrior, &quot;but for now, rest, to save
      your strength for when the time to kill them is right.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;HEY&quot; said a low, threatening voice, &quot;What in the name of
      Tunare do you think you're doing?&quot;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0px; margin: 0px" align="left"><br>
      The warrior gasped. He dropped the rag and backed away towards the back
      wall of the cell&nbsp; &quot;I said, What do you think you are
      doing?&quot; the human insisted<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Nothing&quot; said the warrior in a voice that revealed his fear.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Planning a revolt are we?&quot; inquired the human with a hint of
      sarcasm.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Oh, God, no&quot; replied the warrior, this time, clearly
      frightened. The human snickered.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It was me,&quot; I said without thinking, &quot;I was planning a
      revolt, he was trying to stop me.&quot; The human grinned at me with
      yellow, rotting teeth.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;No,&quot; the warrior quickly objected, &quot;she's trying to cover
      for me.&quot; He said protectively.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Enough&quot; said the human; &quot; I will 'discipline' you
      both.&quot; He snickered<br>
      <br>
      He picked up a whip and began to beat the warrior. Without thinking, I
      casted Siphon Life on the human. He stumbled back and thrashed at me with
      his sword. It slit my left cheek. I cried out in pain and felt the red
      liquid begin to ooze from that cheek again. Then, the warrior decapitated
      the human.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Wow, Cool&quot;, was all I could say.<br>
      <br>
      We searched the lighty's corpse and found nothing, not even keys. All we
      got was a fine steel broad sword in which I let the warrior keep for
      finishing the guard.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Damn&quot; muttered the warrior, &quot; now we have hide the body,
      or get rid of it somehow, but the problem is where.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Let's hide him in the false wall,&quot; I suggested.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What false wall,&quot; he asked. He looked up at me with dull,
      tired, yet curious eyes.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This one.&quot; I said as I showed him the wall. After some thought
      i told him &quot;But, we mustn't try to escape until the time is right,
      timing is everything.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      I had just begun to notice the blood seeping out of my once again open
      wound when I looked out of the cell. I saw a female lighty, supplying us
      with water and cloths.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Why do they neglect us, beat us, then feed us, and allow us to wash
      up?&quot; I asked.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This is a guess, but what I'm thinking is that they want to use us
      for some sort of a show.&quot; The warrior answered calmly.<br>
      <br>
      I gasped and almost began to cry I just wanted to go home. I never once
      did anything wrong.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Wait, don't use that water to clean up with, use mine, we'll save
      that bowl for an emergency drink, if need be.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Good idea,&quot; he replied.<br>
      <br>
      The next day came and I was getting hungry again. I would occasionally
      groan from the pain, but would try to keep it to myself; I didn't want the
      warrior to feel sorry for me. Though, somehow I know he wouldn't, but if
      he did, it wasn't what I wanted.<br>
      <br>
      That night, before we went to sleep, I bent over him and whispered quietly
      in his ear, &quot;Tomorrow, freedom shall be ours once again.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      When we woke up, still unaware of the hour, whether it be morning or
      evening, I quietly slid the bricks out of place, once by one while the
      warrior kept watch. &quot;You know, I should be doing that right
      now,&quot; he said, &quot;after all, I AM the man of this cell.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      I stuck my tongue out at him. &quot;I can handle it, besides you make too
      much noise.<br>
      <br>
      The work lasted quite a while though, so we ended up taking shifts. But at
      last we made a big hole, enough room for him and his full body of armor to
      fit through.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Wait for the next time the guard passes by, then, we shall make our
      move,&quot; I said<br>
      <br>
      The guard was an unsanitary, beastly, unintelligent human. He had nice
      armor and a fantastic weapon but not the brains to operate them.<br>
      <br>
      As soon as he passed we began crawling through the small passage, and my
      hunger really got to me. The warrior was leading the way, and I couldn't
      take it anymore. I collapsed and didn't have the strength to lift myself
      up again, or I didn't think I did. During this time of unconsciousness, I
      dreamed one of the most significant dreams that I ever did, or hopefully,
      ever will. I heard a voice, soft and meaningful that implored me, and
      plead for me to listen<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Get up. You are a Teir'Dal, don't give into death so quickly, so
      willingly. Never give up, I know it's agonizing, but you can't give in. If
      you do, decide to, Innoruuk won't accept you. Get up.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      The voice wasn't what tortured me though, it was the visions.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I was home, in Neriak and talking and joking with old friends. We
      used to hunt together all the time. Oh, how I missed them. In a cloud of
      mist, the scene changed. I was suddenly in a dark forest, but it was
      unfamiliar, not Nektulos or any place I had ever been. I saw one of my
      good friends. I tried to call to her, but she didn't hear me. Then, I
      heard a low, threatening growl, and saw two glowing, yellow, eyes with red
      pupils. My friend noticed it, but it was too late. She was thrown to the
      ground with a loud thud. She cried out as the monster's claws ripped
      through her armor and deep into her flesh. The beast left her corpse. It
      was almost unrecognizable. Her face was ripped off and her hair tinted
      red, from her blood. I turned to look away and appeared in an oasis, the
      Oasis of Marr.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I saw two of my other friends. They were hunting and laughing,
      joking, having a good time. This vision put my heart at ease, for a time.
      Then, my heart nearly broke when I felt the ground shake and rumble from
      the footsteps of a sand giant. I tried to call out to them, to warn them,
      but they couldn't hear me. They looked up to see a grinning giant looming
      over them. They yelled for help and tried to run, but they never made it.
      They were torn to shreds, and their remains, thrown to the oasis water to
      be eaten by deep-water crocodiles.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      I couldn't stand this, this feeling of helplessness. I couldn't help at
      all. I couldn't warn them. I couldn't save them. I could only watch and
      cry. I suddenly got the huge will to live again. To avenge my friend's
      deaths, to not let myself sink into the shadows as in this vision I did.<br>
      <br>
      With a gasp I jerked up, and opened my eyes. The warrior was looking at
      me, hoping that he wouldn't have to endure this alone. His eyes were
      tinted a red, he had been crying. When he saw me get up, he smiled. I felt
      somehow, regenerated. I felt great and the bad dream had had this effect
      on me.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Let's get the hell out of here.&quot; I said.<br>
      <br>
      He agreed and continued to lead on.<br>
      <br>
      Somewhere around an hour later, we came across the aqueduct sewer system
      of Qeynos. Now, we had to find our way out from here. We spent hours
      looking for a way out. He collapsed from hunger, I guessed, but I casted
      Spirit Armor and he was up again. We continued our search. After many
      false walls we passed through, he yelled to me:<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Come here! I found a way out!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      With the sound of those words, I came running, despite my weakness. The
      deep, hunger that had constantly been eating away at me for quite sometime
      now subsided for a few moments. I wanted out and we had found a way. I was
      so happy, I could scarcely contain myself. I would have gated a while ago,
      but who knew where I was bound, and I didn't want to leave the warrior.<br>
      <br>
      Freedom was ours again. The warrior took me in his arms, and held me for
      the longest time. I rested my head on his shoulder. Then, like a dream, he
      was gone.<br>
