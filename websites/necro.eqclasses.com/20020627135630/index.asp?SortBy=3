If you choose to run the new interface, please edit your EQCLIENT.INI file and, under the defaults section, add the line: <br><br>NewUI=TRUE <br><br>...and feel free to have a look around! <br><br>As always, your feedback is welcomed through the Developer's Corner. <br><br>Random new toys worth checking out in the new interface: <br><br>Item Inspection: Alt-Leftclick now pops up the inspect box and keeps it there. <br>  <br>Quantity Selection: You can now type numbers when referring to stackable items and coins. <br>  <br>Key Mapper: Every top level window still has a hotkey you can use to open and close it, and all of the keys can still be remapped through the Options screeen. (The hex nut icon in the window selector, or Alt-O by default). To turn the window selector itself on and off, the default key is Alt-W. <br>  <br>Mousewheel: ...should automatically work in every UI screen that has a scroll bar. (including Chat, Merchants, Looting, etc.) <br>For those interested in developing custom skins for the interface: <br><br>You'll notice that there is now a directory called UIFiles beneath your EverQuest install directory. <br><br>The default skin (aka "The New UI") is stored in the directory called, predictably "default," and we've included a document called "AboutSIDL.doc" in the UIFiles directory. <br><br>If you make yourself a new skin, please create a separate directory for it in the UIFiles directory. Once the skin is in there, you can switch to it by typing "/loadskin " <br><br>Working with the skins at this point is not an activity for the faint of heart, but if you're inclined to hack around in those files, AboutSIDL will hopefully help out a bit. <br><br>This one we definitely can't just sign "- The EverQuest Development Team." <br><br>Many, many people have contributed to this effort, be it artwork, technology, or suggestions. <br><br>So, for now, we'll sign it this way: <br><br>- The EverQuest Team <br>- The Sovereign Team <br>- The SOE Platform Art Team <br>- The SOE Testing Department <br>- The SOE Game Operations Team <br>- The SOE Customer Service Department <br>- The SOE Platform Coding Team <br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font face="verdana" size="1" color="white"></blockquote>Return to top</a><br>&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="black" width="1"></td></tr>

(An NPC must be able to "see" you to hit you with a spell.)<br><br>Scott Hartsman seemed like he had the proper perspective for the players' concerns. He summed it up well with his comments about "cheating" NPCs. The patch on the 12th addressed many of the ways that NPCs "cheat" or were given unfair advantages. However, there was no mention of LoS fixes in the patch message. I know from experience that the casters in Sol B are still rooting, nuking, and slowing me from behind walls and around corners. Would you please update the players on the status of the LoS updates?<br><br><br>Absor writes: We decided not to move that particular part of the changes Live.
