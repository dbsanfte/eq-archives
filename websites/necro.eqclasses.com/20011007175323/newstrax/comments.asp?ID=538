As I’d mentioned in an earlier post, we do hesitate to call it an ‘RP’ server for two reasons:<BR><BR>1. We feel all of our servers are Role Playing Servers and that EverQuest is indeed a Role Playing Game.<BR><BR>2. We feel it’s pretty much impossible to define what Role Playing is verbally, much less via a rule set.<BR><BR>The idea then came up to call it the ‘Alignment’ server, since a character’s alignment is pretty key to many of the features we’re implementing. But, to me, that still doesn’t speak to what the server is really all about. From my perspective it’s an RP server, an Alignment server, a hard-core ‘Seige Perilous’ style server, and, quite simply, an experiment server, where we’re implementing some potential ideas for the long-term future, as well as some features we’d probably have put in the game originally, given 20/20 hindsight.<BR><BR>So, from here forward, I’m just going to call it by its server name, Firiona Vie (in fact, while we’re waiting on the Nameless to create more gods, we plan on naming future servers after Heroes and other prominent mortals in Norrath’s illustrious history). We don’t mind if you still call it the RP Server, or whatever else you’re so inclined, but we’re going to stick to using its ‘proper’ name.<BR><BR>Lastly, before I list the features, I do want to say the following again: This feature set will undoubtedly be controversial. It will also undoubtedly NOT be consistent with many players’ views as to what an RP server or any other server should be. In fact, this is (combined with having less servers overall in the past) why we’ve been hesitant to launch such a server. But we’re going forward with this anyway, and we hope it will make an interesting and even possibly better EverQuest. And we hope that some if not many players will enjoy it. <BR><BR>At the very least, it sure will be a different server <BR><BR>-Brad<BR><BR>--------<BR><BR>Firiona Vie Server Feature List:<BR><BR>· This is a new server, not a split server. Nor will there be any transfers to this server.<BR><BR>· This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player) server. In other words, it’s a standard ‘blue’ server with the same rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. It is not one of the ‘Zeks’.<BR><BR>· Auction restricted to city zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade, Highkeep, Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas, Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Greater Faydark, Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel, Cabilis, Kael and Thurgadin.<BR><BR>· Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than the caster.<BR><BR>· Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as newbie notes and epic weapons.<BR><BR>· Each character will be assigned an "alignment" upon creation. This alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen (in the same location the their Deity is described).<BR><BR>· Each character will be able to change their alignment once any time after they reach 10th level. The player will be able to chose from a list of alignments based on their race, class and deity.<BR><BR>· A character's alignment will determine whether or not they can group or guild with other characters.<BR><BR>· A character's alignment will determine an experience bonus or penalty when grouping with other characters.<BR><BR>· A character's alignment will determine if they can cast beneficial spells on other characters (including resurrections).<BR><BR>· Language skills will improve only through group chat in the same zone and from /say.<BR><BR>· Languages will only improve 1 point each hour and will be capped at level*5+5 skill points.<BR><BR>· Common will not exist. A Human language will be added and only made easily available to certain races.<BR><BR>· One character per account per server.<BR><BR>· The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones.<BR><BR>· Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where melee characters can bind on other servers.<BR><BR>· /emote will be language specific<BR><BR>· All characters will be /roleplay.<BR><BR>· /alignment will display the alignment of your character and probably a more detailed description of that alignment. <BR><BR><br></p></td><tr><tr><td background="img/white.jpg"><img src="img/white.jpg" width=1 height=10></td>
