You can solo them from 27 upwards if you play it safe, and I have seen a group of three level 23s killing them before with little difficulty.<br><br>

The guards are located at the first two Inns, Reskin at the first Tolus at the second.  I personally like killing Tolus myself because it's an easier pull.  Go behind the Inn Tolus is at to the ruins at summon/park your pet there and give him a shot of Intensify Death.  Once your full of mana and ready to go, sneak up on the left or right sides of the Inn and look for Tolus.  Pull him with either Engulfing or Dooming Darkness (depends on your level) and bring him back to the ruins and your pet.  You can stop on the way to ruins and cast another DoT on him and anywhere from 2 to 4 casts of Shock of Poison.  Send your pet after him as soon as you can. He will probably still come after you because of the DoTs, but all you have to do is run out to casting range and give him a SoP or Life Drain spell until he dies.<br><br>

With Reskin you have different options on where to park your pet, it can be in the tunnel, but you'd probably have the guard dead before then.  On a hill around the Inn, which is good.  Or at the zone into Freeport, which will give you time to kill or severely injure the guard before you reach your pet.<br><br>

Both guards have been known to resist darkness, but just train them to your pet and then cast till it sticks.  They also resist SoP maybe one out of every 7 casts.<br><br>

DANGER: You absolutely HAVE to make sure Sergeant Slate is nowhere around the guards when you pull them.  If by some chance you DO get Slate on your tail, run for all your worth to the nearest zone for he will kill you real fast.  Slate is level 41 and can easily take two Griffs at a time, so AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS.</td></tr><tr><td width='98' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma' size='2'>Author</td><td width='499' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma'size='2'><a href ='mailto:sykopath69@yahoo.com'>Mordicai Nar`Zhul</td></tr><tr></table><br><br><table border='0' width=611><tr><td width='100%' colspan='2' bgcolor='#21456B'><p align='left' style='word-spacing: 0; margin: 0'><b><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Additional Comments</font></b></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Odyssey Painful</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>First head to Inn 1 for Guard Reskin and Inn 2 for Guard Tolus.  Once there, take a lookout for Sergeant Slate, don't want to bump into him as he hits pretty hard (100+). After the coast is clear pull him off using Heat Blood to as far away from the Inn as possible then sending your pet to attack him. As you used a DoT to pull the guard should aggro your pet pretty easily, then cast off with clinging darkness ( not engulfing darkness as all you want is a Snare effect ) once clinging darkness kicks in he should still he pumping your pet. You got to act fast now as your pet is low on Hp after the beating cast off fear and then Shock of Poison and nuke nuke nuke. After that if he ain't fried yet he is definitely going to murder you and not care bout pet so run as far away as possible and recast Clinging Darkness, do bother to fear anymore as once darkness kicks in you should be able to increase your distance from the guard and then continue nuking him till he's fried. Takes a little practice but once you get the hang of it the exp is great and further more you can get heals and buff form high level PC at tunnel :D</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Sertaradin Verin`Xukuth</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Well I am a psychotic suicidal, so I tried Tolus at level 26.  I whopped him.  And he had a FS rapier too.  Good stuff.  Personally, the XP isn't THAT good, but it's made up for by a quick spawn time.  The loot is nice too.  He's had anywhere from 9cp to 3pp in change.  The danger though is another thing.  Good ol' Seargant Slate.  Punched me for 119. Thank the gods I was sowed.  Anyway I think you should add that to the guides, because it CAN be done and I liked it :)</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Arisilde Puppy</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>First bind yourself near entrance to north Ro.  Then get a SOW that is easy just go to Ro tunnel and give a shout.  Then Gather shadows go near one of the inns and scope it out. make sure Sergeant Slate is not around ( he will hurt you BAD).  Then once you are sure he is not around cast allure of death.  Get as far away from the guard as you can near the sand.  Then heat blood run away until out of range cast leech (this should put you in the sand almost on the zone wall) then run towards Ro tunnel until he is far enough away cast heart flutter.  Run some more cast siphon life.  If you are fighting Guard Reskin you should be on the dune that is past the Ro tunnel now.  Now go down in the sand away from wall and head back up to zone wall near Ro tunnel recast siphon and repeat until dead. If things get ugly gate.  If things get real ugly, feign death and make sure allure of death does not run out if it does just recast.  This gives about 1/3 a bubble per kill.  They drop a few plat and sometimes FS weapons and some research stuff (words runes and such).</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Sisben Nerfomancer</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>You can do these guards solo from level 24.  Tulos preferably since he is the easier to pull, and at such a low level you don't want the hassle of pulling Reskin.  Sit near the sand, cast pet, med to full (you need it). buff pet, allure of death.  Let the pet stand near the sand, while you go fetch Tulos.  The darkness lines and fear will be resisted frequently but that is why you have you pet (love him).  SoP him if you cant get fear off, so he will agro on you (I sure hope you remembered to have darkness stick) just let him chase you a bit and eventually he will turn back to your pet, and then try fear again. I always did get hit a bit, and my pet was usually around 40% this is mostly due to resists.<br><br>

GREAT XP at this level and relative fast spawn.  When I grow up some more i want to take out big bad slate :)</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Cenanan</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>I have found these to be soloable at levels 21+.  You simply need to make sure your darkness sticks and you have all your DoTs on him (heat blood, Heart flutter, Poison bolt, Leach).  You also want allure of death.  Have your pet following you around and keep him in say range (pet that is, not the guard).  Once you pull him (SoW is a must) with engulfing darkness, just run a little ways away and cast 1-2 dots on him and run again.  With the new system of messaging, when the DoT wears off you can keep them alive.  After your DoTs are all on him, send your pet in.  With any luck, he will remain aggro to you and not your pet.  If he starts to attack your pet just run towards him and he will start after you again.  XP is good.  AVOID SLATE.</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Zeculus Shadowslayer</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Ok first I cannot warn you enough, WATCH OUT FOR SLATE! He can kill me at lvl 22 in about 4 good hits. It is a good idea to always have SOW when fighting here just because of him. Also you should set you pet up fairly far away so you can pull to him, and make sure your pet is buffed, it helps alot. Once you see that the area is clear of Slate, cast endulfing darkness on either Reskin or Tolus. If it sticks, run some and cast heat blood, run some more and cast heart flutter. If it does not stick hope you have SOW and run some and try to get it to stick. Once you get to pet the guard should already be hurt some and very aggo to you. Send the pet in and cast fear until it sticks. They dotn seem to resist too much, even though they are red. If any DoTs run out recast them as the guard is feared, and regularly resact darkenss. You can use clinging if you have problems with mana, but I ended up with full health, and a bubble of mana almost every fight. When hes almost dead, nuke with ur best spell and finish him off. You must fear alot because the lvl 20 pet can’t take a long beating from him at all. Ok peopel will call you crazy for trying to solo guards at lvl 22(the lvl im soloin them at now), bu once you see the exp and loot coming in, and you not dying at all, you can laugh at them.</font></td></tr></table></td></table></div>
