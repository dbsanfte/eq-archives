Lol Serrin, I will have to copy and paste that reply from you and email it to me cleric friend, she is so sick of playing her cleric, most of the time she groups with me, she does nothing at all.  Rofl, ill lose a bub of hp (and we all now that is nothing to a necro) and she will celestial elixir me, just because she has nothing to do.  My pet is always herod, bulthwark of faith'd, symbol'd.  And since I have yet to get my spectre pet, Im still using my monk or rogue pet (depending on if im root dotting or fear kiting), and the damned pet has more than 2500hp, not to mention the heals.

        <td bgcolor='black' valign='top' width='100%'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Ok so this is more of a rant than anything. I've been logging on my cleric to do rezzes and buffing on occasion, but haven't been playing her at all. So today I figured it was about time I upped her levels a bit to get the 90% rez. I log her on and run to GD to kill some giants with a couple guildies. One was a wizzie and one was an SK I've been grouping my necro with. So the SK is pullin and I'm noticing big time how slow my manna is going up and how much manna healing uses and how often we have to stop pulls for me to gain some manna. It's been a long time since I logged the cleric on for more than 20 minutes, so I'm thinking "Ok, no biggie, I'm just a lil spoiled from CoB and Lich". A few pulls later we get a couple wolf adds pulled with a giant. On a cleric, with no chanters around, adds are a serious problem. I'm rooting the wolves as much as I can while trying to keep the SK healed (he's being beat on by a giant and 2 wolves since the roots keep breaking and if he FDs, the wizzie and I are dust). The wizzie is trying to help with the rooting while nuking the giant to kill it fast as my manna is running low quickly. The SK is getting beat on too much to do more than pray I have enough manna for another heal while the wizze mems evac. I hit OOM and the wizzie calls for an evac. We had managed to kill the giant and one of the wolves by then, but still had to evac as the SK was down to a bubble of health, I'm oom and the wizzie has enough manna for the evac only. So luckily we all make it out in time, and I'm making some not so pleasant comments about how useless a cleric is outside of buffs. So we start to head back to our hunting spot. They have Jboots, my cleric doesn't. So the wizze invises me and they leave me in the dust. I end up going the wrong way, invis drops and I'm lost. I always carry invis on my cleric, so I cast one and head out again. Of course, it drops right away so I gotta use another one. By this point I'm feeling utterly useless as they are back at the spot, waiting on me. I get fed up, apologise for leaving so quickly, and camp. <BR>If I had been on my necro, the adds would have been controlled, I could throw up BoD and Lich and still have enough health to heal the SK (he even commented that I can heal better with my necro since compact uses so little manna and BoD more than makes up the HP I used to heal him), done some damage to the mobs, invised myself on the run back (which I most likely wouldn't have needed to do since I could have controlled the adds) AND would have had a pet doing a considerable amount of damage. <BR>I don't think I'll be doing more with my cleric than dusting her off  for buffs and rezzes once in a while. After playing a necro, there is no comparison.</font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Well you don't give levels so I can't pick apart the situation in detail, but it sure seems to me like you guys all need some practice.  A group like the one you describe should have had no trouble dealing with the situation you had, unless you were like level 35 or something.</P><P>First off, I'm assuming your clerics isn't 39 yet.  At 39 any heal over about 1100 HP makes Cheal efficient.  Unless the SK you group with is horribly under-equipped he should easily be well over 1100HP with you buffs.  If you are 39 then you need to practice timing cheals better; when fighting MOST XP mobs, even a moderately equipped cleric can med back the mana from a cheal before they have to cast it again.  Honestly, in that group the cleric really shouldn't be trying to do much other than heal, as the Wizard could have handled anything the cleric could.  The only exception being Fear (which the silly SK could have done as well.)  While a cleric's toolbox may lack in variety, it is mostly oriented toward preventing and healing damage.  Roots are not the only way to CC, they have great stuns and can fear only slightly less effectively than a necro.</P><P>I have to critize all of you realy.  It sounds like if anything you need MORE practice with your cleric rather than less.  Boring as it may be, your job as a cleric is first to heal and everything else comes after.  In a group like that, you should have assigned the Wiz the job of CC.  They have stuns, root and snares.  I have seen wizzies outperform some crappy enchanters even when doing CC in outdoor zones.  The fact that your wizzie was nuking at all in that situation tells me he needs some practice at recognizing how to best spend that precious mana.  I'll just go ahead and assume the SK actually plays a warrior most of the time, because the only way I can understand an SK getting an add in a zone like GD is that he either forgot he had FD or he was smoking crack.  If you got adds because of your location then you all deserve a whack on the ass with a big wooden paddle for being idiots in the first place.  Just how did you end up oom and the wizzie end up lom in that fight anyway? What, were you and the wiz at like 10 mana when he went to pull?  WTF?  How do you go OOM so quickly otherwise?  Even with those adds, I cannot understand how your group could possibly have a problem with that fight.  Throughout your tale, it just seems like you are all less than competant at the classes you were playing.</P><P><BR>Clerics are far from useless for things other than healing and buffing, but it is foolish for them to spend mana in other ways unless the absolutley have to.  It is simply a matter of efficiency, something you should understand well as a necro.  It is poor form for you to bash a class because you don't really understand it - isn't that the kind of crap that necro's deal with all the time?  </P><P>A cleric is a class that it takes a special kind of person to play as a main.  They are somehow both boring and stressful to play at the same time.  A cleric's entire career is based around waiting for something to do, and what they are waiting to do is prevent something bad from happening.  Clerics are a very linear class to play, much like a Wiz.  They both have a little variety thrown in to make them interesting and viable classes, but they excel so well at what they specialize in that it is generally inefficient to have them do anything else unless there is nobody else to do it.  </P><P>I could go on but I'm too annoyed right now to bother.  You all clearly need to learn how to play a little better, or you were trying to take on stuff well beyond your group's ability to handle.  Either way you all fucked up, it has nothing to do with the classes involved.</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22254" target="_blank">Sssyx Syxyx</a><BR><a href="http://eqmoonies.freeservers.com">Spirit of the Moon</a></P><P><a href="mailto:sssyx@mmdog.com">sssyx@mmdog.com</a></P><P></font></td>

They can't kill greens without meditating 90% of the time, so they suck at tradeskills, factions and quests, the only non-raiding thing to do at 60.  Melees of all kind solo in FG now, and get A LOT more xp than in any group with a cleric leeching xp.</P><P>So clerics are really only needed at raids, and the rest of the game is really miserable.  Asking your guildleader if it's ok to change mains if you're a cleric is like asking to rape their grandmother.</P><P>Which is why necs whining about how useless they are at raids bugs me.  Most clerics would gladly love to have the raid burden lifted.  The pressure and obligation to be there the whole raid is just enormous and cruel.</P><P>Really hope EQ2 addresses this.  Clerics should be more like paladins.  Remove CH from the game.  Give them some melee capability.  With the natural evolution of min/maxing clerics would still med and heal in group situations but they could at least be able to kill green mobs at 60 that 34 necs are killing with ease.</P><P> </font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Sssyx, I'm so glad you've been watching me play the entire time I've played EQ so you can know exactly how I play and exactly what I did wrong....what's that? You haven't been watching me? Well then thanks for your info, go play in the street. <BR>I've gotten more than one comment on how well I play my cleric. And if all you ever do on your cleric (assuming you have actually played one) is heal, then I'd hate to have you in my group. I'm well past the point of Chealing, and understanding the basic concept of it. I'd like to see you get a Cheal off (10 second casting time) while your tank is getting beat down fast. My stun was getting resisted constantly, the SK's fear was getting resisted constantly and yeap the wizzie could have kited them, along with the other 5 or 6 mobs not far from us. If the SK had FD, the wizzie and I would have been dead in no time...but considering he's not a total jackass, he didn't. I've grouped in this exact same spot many times with the SK while on my necro and we have had adds, and it's never been a problem. Considering there is only 3 levels difference between my necro and my cleric, the situation should not have been this far different.</P><P>I didn't post this to give you a chance to throw out every insult you could to me and my group members, because you weren't there. I didn't think it would be needed for me to post every detail of the fight since my main goal was to express disappointment in how dependant a cleric is on other people compared to a necro. But that's ok, you go ahead and criticise some more, cuz you know exactly what happened the entire time and exactly how I fucked up. So glad I can have someone as all knowing and perfect as you to show me the errors of my ways.</P><P>I've seen some of the people on this board go off on people for some pretty stupid reasons, but this one tops the cake for me. Go ahead and assume I'm too stupid to do more than get lucky at managing to hit the keys in the order to make words cuz I really don't give a flying fuck. You've shown me what kind of person you are just by 1 post, and I don't care to be associated with people of your type. I'm not going to be wasting my time responding to someone like you anymore.</font></td>
