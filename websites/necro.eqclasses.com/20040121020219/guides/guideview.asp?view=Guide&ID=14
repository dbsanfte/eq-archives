				This guide is intended for anyone between the level range of 49 and 55. <br><br>Spell Setup -<br>1. Insidious Retrogression<br>2. Invoke Fear<br>3. Bond of Death<br>4. Paralyzing Earth<br>5. Invoke Death<br>6. Augment Death<br>7. Feign Death<br>8. Lich<br><br>Now, to get to this spot, its take a little bit of a run. I would suggest either hoping through the Freeport PoK book, or getting a port to WC and running through Kith ( dont forget IVU ! ) Just follow the right wall after zoning into Kith all the way around the zone until you get to a small entrance into some mountains. Zone into Highhold Pass and invis up. Guards dont like your necro butt ! It took me a few times to find the keep ... but after the first few tries, its simple. Walk through HP till you get to the bridge above the water with the single guard. Take a right from here down the ledge, and the first immediate left. Walking through the twisting path a bit, take your next right and pretty soon you should be facing the keep. Zone in and run through the first floor ( Now might be a time to explore a bit, familiarize yourself with the location of the bank and the erudite merchant that you can sell to even at KoS ) and run up to the second floor. There will be a room on your right when your on the second floor, that has 2 bards and Isabella, then a little further down there will be a room in the middle to your left, and if you pass through it, right across from the bards room there will be a room with 2 nobles and some merchants. This middle room is where I usually setup, but you need to be careful, Isabella sometimes walks from the bards room to the nobles room. Summon up a pet, slap on lich, buff your pet ( might also want to use tiny companion, as quarters can get tight here ) and your ready to roll. Now at 49 your going to get a few things jumping on you. Dont worry, they hit for around 100-110 max and if your quik with what your doing, wont get but a few hits in before your pet is tanking them for you. And a good tank he is, this spot will really let you know how well the 49 can fair.<br><br>Now to begin the slaughter. First thing I always did was rooted the female bard, this will make the male bard come running at you, step back a bit and let the pet tank him. Slap Insidious on him ( 500+ nuke plus 60% snare, saves you from having to VoS and DD ) and then fear him. Now the bards have a little more HP than Isabella and the nobles so I always slapped BoD on just for the extra dmg, and to negate any other hits im about to take. With the way the 49 pet tears through these things, by the time fear wear off they will either be dead or 10%, so they dont usually have a chance to hit your pet. Now slap Insidious on the other bard, and fear and either wait for root to break or send in pet to tank for a bit, he can take it. Once the bards are dead, you have 30 minutes till they spawn again. Now, stand in the doorway and start casting Insidious on Isabella, when it lands, take off down the hallway to the middle room, and stand on the other side of the hallway, facing the doorway in wich isabella is going to come around. As soon as you see her, start casting fear and send pet. It is enough time to get maybe even a fizzle before she gets to you, then shes off runnin. Insidious and pet are more than enough for her, go sit in front of the nobles room and wait for an exp msg. As soon as shes dead, simpley root one of the nobles. This will bring the other to you. Wait until its in the hallway out of the room and get pet on it, his it with Insidious, fear and then sit and wait for exp. Then insidious the rooted one, fear and send pet. This is all rather easy and once they are broken it becomes even easier. Simpley pull with insidious, fear and send pet and your good to go. Isabella and nobles are on a 6 minute spawn time, so remember you can get in about 4 rounds before its bard time again.<br><br>Experience here was sickening at 49, I was getting 2% every other kill as an Iksar. At 50 it stays steady pretty much 1% per kill all the way to 53. Wich is what I advise you to do. Grind all the way to 53 and 99% and then dump ALL your exp into AA. You can get 1 AA in about 1.5-2 hrs here not even breaking a sweat. I got my Baron title in 2 days of work on this spot. If you have the patience, stay as loooooong as you can. Work out some AA for SCM3 and maybe SCF1 for fun ( you would deserve it after the boredom ) After your done with AA, just turn reg exp back on, ding 54, and then grind out 55. 54 was kind of a pain here, but compared to other spots, it cant be beat.<br><br>NOTE: 53 is KEY level for AA exp here, at this level only about 1 in 10 nobles were light blue, and most all was dblue.<br><br>Loot here is right on par with the exp as well. All guards are green to you and take the 49 pet a few seconds to kill, and all drop FS sword plus random change. there are 4 floors of guards and plenty of time in between waiting on Isabella and the nobles to respawn to gank a few guards here and there. I would easily make 300-500 pp an hr here just crap killing the guards between spawns. <br><br>Pro: Insane exp from 49-55 and awesome AA exp at 53, quik money for those higher end spells, very easy and teaches you how to manage fear and adds in a small area.<br><br>Cons: This spot is heavily camped. While I dont think anyone can kill here as fast as a necro, everyone sure does love to try. I have waited on this camp sometimes for 4 hrs, but during this time I killed the guards for the FS and made a good 600-700pp an HR.<br><br>All in all, this spot will spoil you and get you to Baron and Defiler faster than any other spot I know of ... when you can get it !<br>&nbsp;<br>
