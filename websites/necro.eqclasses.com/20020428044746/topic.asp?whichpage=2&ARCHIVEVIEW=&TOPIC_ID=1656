This is all the more surreal, when it was a druid that was disagreeing.  <i>(You could make a strong argument that if it were, say a necromancer, making remarks like, "I hate Druids. Over powered as it is and yet they still ask to be even more group friendly," that this was just a cross class issue.)</i><BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>The scariest thing is that you’re not understand what it is Druids are asking for.  I wasn’t exaggerating what they are asking for. I explained it in fair easy to understand terms.</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote><BR>I don't play a druid and I don't group enough to go criticising which classes are, or aren't balanced, really.  <i>(I do carry the standard annoyance at trying to hunt something, only to find that a druid is hogging all the spawns, but what can ya do?  (I'm compensated for this by watching quad kiters get ripped to shreds, every so often, when they run outta mana.))</i>  And, I only tend to browse other classes forums, on occaisions such as this, where a link is posted.  However, I have noticed that almost invariably, the link is always accompanied by derision of whatever class it is who feel the need improving.  The general response here seems to be almost that druids deserve to beaten soundly with the nerf bat, rather than improved in any way.<BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>Well, excuse the fuck out-a-me.  You might call my explanation a criticism but I’ll call it an explanation, thank you very much.  </P><P>The Druid petition isn’t just about improving their already immensely sought after class, their petition is about making the Druid class essential as the secondary healer on large raids and their little “improvement” would make the Druid class capable of EXCLUDING Clerics on smaller raids.  </P><P>I certainly wasn’t calling for a nerf or Druids, I was providing support for the “suffering” Druids were complaining about enduring and the reason for the petition.  </P><P><BR><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote></P><P>The curiousity in this, is that I'm fairly sure that if I was to hunt around a bit, I could probably find the occaisional thread on other classes boards, that does the same thing.  <i>(Posts linking to here, so everyone can deride what the 'stupid necros' want.  Posts linking to mage boards, so people can laugh that mages think their pet is underpowered.  You know what I mean.)</i>  This can't possibly help anyone.  All that this leads to is that no-one gets anything.  <i>(Druids get nothing, 'cos we have announce they need whupping with the nerf bat.  Necros get nothing, 'cos druids announced that we need an equally sound whupping with the bat.  Mages get nothing, 'cos everyone has pet envy.  And so on.)</i><BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>All “stupid” necromancers want is a legitimate purpose and role post 53. Find me one of those “let’s laugh at the necromancers” threads on another board.  I’ll enjoy reading it.  </P><P>Why do you think this can’t help anyone?  I’d think that developers not wasting time on flippant whines and focusing on genuine concerns would be a benefit for everyone not a hindrance.  You realize those “Druids” sent that petition to Verant, you realize those Druids are serious?  Those individuals actually believe they have a legitimate concern.  They don’t and some times people need a dose of reality.  Druids’ certainly do.  </P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote><BR>After all, this <b>is</b> how nerfs happen.  You remember Mrylokar's dagger?  It didn't get nerfed 'cos the guy who got it stanted sending tells to GMs explaining it was too powerful.  It was nerfed, because a million and one people, who saw it on sites like Allakhazam's, starting bitching about it.  <i>(I find it extremely hard to believe that Verant's QA group did this off their own back, because if that was the case, it'd have been 'fixed', before it went live!)</i><BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>Verant has always relied on the stupidity of its’ customers when it comes to item nerfs.  Class nerfs come from misconceptions and preconceived notions most of the time.  </P><P>I hate Druids.  I kill ‘em all the time, every chance I get.  Sue me.</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote><BR>I know full well that it's not gonna happen, but I genuinely believe that we'd get a whole lot further, if everyone wasn't busy tryin' to shout everyone else down.  <BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>I'm not posting on the Druid boards, what's your point?</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote><BR>I'm also inclined to believe that no druid really expects to get the whole of their list of requests.  <i>(Well, some of them no doubt do, but there's never a shortage of idiots, playing any class.)</i><BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>You’re foolish as Hell then.  That petition was written as a reasonable request.  The creator of that petition considers the requests a reasonable solution to the problem.  Or didn’t you read the thread?  Are you saying the writer of the petition is an idiot?</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote><BR>  A round of balancing is coming up and it's like a kid's Christmas list.

It really is.  How can anyone who is reasonable even consider giving Druids yet another improvement?  For the love of Inny are you insane?  It would be nice if just once a Necromancer had more value than a Druid in a group, just one time…  </P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote><BR>Curiously, everyone seems to have missed the root of this petition.  At the very base of the issue, is the argument, "Norrath has gotten tougher and we haven't!"  This is the same problem necromancers are bitching about.  <i>(And, though I don't know it for sure, I'd be willing to gamble, the same problem as everyone else who currently feels underpowered.)</i><BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>No you’ve missed the root of the petition, completely.  I suggest you re-read it.  The petition is unreasonable, and written based on the abilities of other classes and uses the abilities of other classes to justify improvement to the Druid class.  </P><P>Necromancers don’t feel under powered.  We feel useless.  There’s a pretty big difference between our concerns and the Druid concerns.</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote><BR><i>"Druids whining for enhancements is a frigging joke on a monumental scale."</i><BR>How many boards do you suppose I could find the same remark on, but directed at necromancers?<BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>None.

I've found my Druid--currently 26 on Brell--somewhat boring to work with. Stand, heal, nuke, sit. /yawn. Playing a Druid can not only be boring as all hell,  but also annoying if you are like my Druid, and refuse to be a buff whore. In fact, the only thing that continues to retain my interest in the roleplay aspect--I play a Half Elf Druid who hates Tunare.</P><P>So, I started a Iksar Necromancer named Arkaron--also on Brell, say hi!--and was thrilled by how fun this class is to play. I actually get to think...</P><P>Druid/Necro issues seem to be very different. Druids want extras, I think.

I'm, a 60 druid and I see many of you made it to the low or mid 50's with your druids so your not fully capable of making that statement. Anyway, why I feel I need to post is the Druid community has always openly supported necro's and any other class that feels they need improvement in certain areas. Never have I read a thread on a druid board bashing any other class. NECROs, we support you and hope you get the improvements you feel are important to you. All classes have issues and one way to get your voice heard is to come together as a community and let Verant know how you feel. Don't take no for an answer and keep bugging them in the most credible way you can. We druids agree your class has issues and we support you! You may not agree with our requests and thats fine, not all druids do either but the majority of druids are in concensus on the letter and that's what we have agreed to send forward. Have you all sent a letter to verant on your issues?</P><P>Minnx Risingmoon<BR>60 Heirophant<BR>Ayonae Ro<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"> Hello.<BR>Druid here.<BR>Just a comment on the druid petition some posters here are obviously not aware of.<BR>Druids are not overpowered. We have our limitations. A lot of them. As we all know we are jack of all trades, we can do a lot (not everything mind you) and the reason for this is not so we can go out and quad, but to help fill in the gaps a group might have while hunting in a dungeon or dangerous zone, or in a big raid, although that is unlikely (yet I have seen it).<BR>To put forth an example, necros are better soloers than druids, wizards are better porters and quadders than druids, Shammans are better buffers and debuffers than druids, Clerics are better healers and HP/AC buffers than druids, and I could go on naming specifics, but that would be too tiresome.<BR>We do have some good tools at our disposal, but, at the end of the day, when that big raid is forming to kill some uber boss mob, it is very unlikely a druid will be missed, not even for porting reasons. We do not have that 'one' essential buff/role/skill necessary to make a raid complete. We can fill gaps, barely, but aren't really a needed class.<BR>That petition, if it is not clear, was thought out by some very good players, who happen to be druids, and is not a petition signed by ALL the druids of Norrath across every server. It has been apparent for some time that until someone points out there is a problem, Verant doesn't listen. So we grabbed the bull by the horns and decided to do something about it. If you feel unhappy you should do the same, not whine at someone else's initiative.<BR>And to dismiss a lot of the myths out there, here is a rundown of where you are all wrong about our skills and spells:</P><P>Heals: Druids have a 10% healing penalty. So, if a heal is supposed to heal for 800, it only does for 720.</P><P>Root: C'mon! It is widespread knowledge our root is the worse one in the game! It can be resisted and has more chances of breaking.</P><P>DoTs: Our dots are NO WAY close toa  Necro's or a Shamman's. My best dot, Winged Death, which I get at 53, does 1287 damage. A Necromancer of the same level can land 2 dots on a mob that do more than 1000 damage, and I'm not even gonna mention Splurt!</P><P>Charm: This is just laughable! Our pet charm is just ridiculous. Not even worth mentioning.</P><P>Epic: LOL! Did you guys realise it gets resisted more than anything in the game? It has a snare and a dot. if one gets resisted both do. Imagine using this on a mob immune to movement... Worthless.</P><P>And to all those losers out there that keep on repeating like a scratched record 'I hate Druids', you should really go visit the brain doctor... again, and get a life too. I was warned against druids when I began playing EQ, and I can agree there are some really lousy druids out there, just like there are Bards, Clerics, Shammans, Rogues, Rangers, Beastlords, Monks, Warriors, oh, and Necros too. Realise one thing, it is not the Druid playing the human, it is the human playing the Druid, and MANY times, a human who plays a Warrior, Cleric, etc. decides to create a druid to 'go farm stuff', THAT is the lousy player. Not the class. You may say they go hand in hand. But that is your worthless opinion. IMO a Necro is far better versed in the art of farming than a Druid is.<BR>Personally I get on great with any number of 'people' in Norrath, be they Clerics, Wizards, Necros, Warriors, etc. I don't make the distinction because of the class, I make the disticntion because of the player. Something A LOT of you could learn to do.</P><P>Ciao for now!</P><P>Araxx Darkroot - 55 Preserver<BR>Clan of the Roc<BR>Bristlebane (funnily enough I know Draknn who began this thread, and have raided with him - small world)<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

I prefer a druid because I also like to buff and heal newbies and other people in need. It fits in perfectly with my personality of helping others. Yes, that includes regening Necros in Lich form...

Yes I say BASH them with the nerf bat. Their "petition" tries to legitimize their pipe dreams. It has nothing to do with balancing at all as they are already way overpowered at ALL levels of the game. It has to do with their being a lazy greedy class and wanting more more more.</P><P>Do the math - count the high level druids then count the high level necros and mages. The simple fact is that "pet" classes are almost wiped out.</P><P>If druids do get balanced then they should be fixed. (Just like a dog is "fixed"). I say take away their ability to teleport completely. I am sick of waiting in some forsaken hole with 6 fucking druids quad kiting and all are "too busy" to offer a port. But this really shows their true nature - totally selfish, hog all the spawns and refuse to do the service they were supposed to provide.</P><P>And now they want a BUNCH of additional things as well? do they really need them the way that Necros and mages need something?

But in case you don't know the sad fact is that there is practically nothing in the high end game that a duo can take on and win.</P><P>The high end game is chronically imbalanced in the favor of the mob's - give me a break at level 57 a mob con's that it would be a fair fight and it can easily and in a few seconds totally destroy a single group and most likely 2 full groups if they aren't good players.</P><P>Perhaps this is where we need to be complaining - VI need to make mob's that have something like the same abilities as a player. Anyone know a level 60 wizard with 200k hitpoints that is totally immune to lifetaps and any spells a level 57 necromancer can cast at him? I sure don't, but I know a couple of mob's that match that description well.

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"> Hehe, so this is the rant forum? Seems more like the 'leave all my manners at the door' forum.</P><P>To Tauruse:<BR>You can tell me 'fuck you' all you like, I am way beyond that. All you do with that is slip further away from the truth. Hell, it wouldn't surprise me to see a post from you which is only Fuck you fuck you....<BR>Try to debunk our petition all you like. You say your class is broken? Wow, and Verant hasn't paid attention to your petition? What? You have no petition? Oh! You wanted us Druids to include a petition for you? Darn! We missed that!<BR>And as for mages, they also made a request to Verant a few months back. I guess you missed that.<BR>What you are is just envious of the people that play druids from taking the initiative, something you obviously didn't think of.</P><P>To Nooloon:</P><P>I do not lie. I see no gain in lying. By doing so I would be diminishing myself, and I do not do that. But that is something which has got nothing to do with the game we play which is EQ.</P><P>A 'skilled player', be him a necro, bard, and yes, *gasp* even a druid, can pull almost anywhere! I know FD is a spell for a necro, funnily enough I also play a necro, not as high level as you, but when I feel like playing a class that only has to fear and dot and sic his pet on the running mob, and doesn't want a ton of tells asking to be buffed, sowed, ported, etc, then I play my necro. I like all classes, hence why I don't class bash like you guys. Vent your frustration? Sure, vent it at the individuals behind them, but to consider the player IS the class?? Even you can see something is VERY wrong with that assertion.<BR>And when you say that you cannot med while engaged with a mob... OMG!!!! What crappy fear raids have YOU been on? Unless three or four are pulled, it is perfectly safe to be medding! The mob is engaged sufficiently far away and taunted well enough for it to not even realise there is anyone else other than the tanks! A druid should be nuking or healing! Snaring even! Not meleeing! A druid can't melee for shit!</P><P>I will admit I was pissed off at the amount of druid bashing going on. Hell, whenever I play my other classes I curse at the kiting druids all the time...<BR>But the petition is sincere. That necros and mages are also broken? I admit that too, but that is something YOU have to deal with, don't expect another class to know yours as good as you, and vice versa. I group regularly with necros and mages in my guild, and we don't have such a bad time.<BR>I am still VERY pissed off at the amount of people who have NO idea at a druid's role in the end game. That is why the Druid petition was created. We don't wanna be uber, shit, I've NEVER even felt uber at being a druid. I feel more uber with my wurmy wielding warrior at level 27 than I feel as my druid at 55. I go invis in newbie zones just to not attract attention, and I ALWAYS help people out. If I can't I apologise 'sorry, real busy atm' and even go WAY out of my way to try and help them later. That is the kind of person I am, and I happen to play a druid...<BR>Last night, in ME, was grouped with some guildies. A 53 enchanter runs past and asks me for SoE. I Give it to her. 3 minutes later I see she has mezzed a mob (those primitive looking Gatherers and Followers...) and is attacking another with it. Mez drops, they both charge her. Her health drops like a bomb, but I manage to cast Chloroblast and save her just as she runs a short distance and mezzes again... That is the kind of character I play. And being a Druid allows me to do it.</P><P>You don't think our petition is fair?<BR>Laugh when Verant rejects it.<BR>Or<BR>Learn when they make changes to adjust the situation.</P><P>If you guys feel broken, make a petition. Caster balancing is just around the corner.</P><P>Ciao for now!</P><P>Araxx Darkroot - 55 Preserver<BR>Clan of the Roc<BR>Bristlebane</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

EVERYONE AND THEIR F-ING MOM KNOW THAT NECROS HAVE BEEN NERFED TO OBLIVION AND ARE BROKEN AT HIGH LEVELS AND YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET ALOT OF SUPPORT, INCLUDING MINE!!!</b>  You guys have gotten so used to whining about other classes abilities that you can't see past your fuggin noses.  Since our petition hit Castersrealm, I have been looking on your main page for a sticky about necro issues and haven't found one.  Contrary to popular belief, alot of druids have necro alts.  I have one myself; while he is only level 25, He is one of my only alts that I have not PLed to a high level because I ACTUALLY WANT TO LEARN TO PLAY A NECRO WELL.</P><P><BR>It's pointless bitching about other classes wants to get fixed when your own class is broken; get off your asses and start a similar discussion.

(get the idea? druids are needed in the game.... necros are not) As it is now I get a request from somone I don't know from a bar of soap perhaps once every two weeks for a corpse summons - and I ALWAYS drop whatever I am doing unless it is a raid to do it for them.</P><P>Regarding the crappy fear raids I've been on... Yes you are completely correct. Fear Raids pretty much are crappy, they are done at levels where people have very little experience working with raid force strengths. I once again however stick to what I said - sit down to med in fear when a mob is engaged or mob's are mezzed and you almost guarantee you get aggro. I know this from my own personal experience as "my role is to make mana and pump" so I get aggro there a lot.</P><P>This brings me to a minor rant. Fear is the perfect zone for pet classes (that know how to control their pets) to contribute. Yet I've only been on a single fear raid (out of about 30) where the raid leader had the balls to tell the numerous idiots to shut the fuck up as pets were fine. Damnit even in closed guild raids I've been denied the use of my pet in fear. The worst thing about this is that this is where ppl "learn" that pets and dots are **BAD IN RAIDS**, sadly most players are so clueless about pet classes that they just accept this nonsense as fact. Why? becuase there are so few high level pet class players in the game that they never get first hand experience with them - WE ARE DIEING OUT. Druids are not dieing out by any stretch of the imagination.</P><P>I'm through bashing you Araxx and I repeat again - I don't bash Druids - but I most certainly stick to my guns on bashing their over the top petition.</P><P>Regarding petitioning VI, I have subitted dozens of requests to them on their censored message boards. All that I have received back from them is their boilerplate responses. I'm done with that :(. Or do you like engaging in long distance conversations with someone who does not talk back at all apart from answering the phone with the message "Thank you for calling about whatever you are calling about"?</P><P>Much better to post on a forum like this where people respond to your ideas and point out what is wrong with them than to submit them to VI's black hole of a message board. If VI don't read this forum, and the other forums for the other classes then they are truly stupid. Heck I've even given them the URL to this forum - never got a reply but I told the VI black hole all about it's great ideas.</P><P>Read thru all the posts I have made on this board and I sincerely doubt you will find me bashing any class. Bashing VI or individuals sure (hehe you come to mind....) but I never tolerate bashing classes and shout out whenever I see it. Some ppl on this board do directly bash druids but their rants are so over the top they need to be taken with a pinch of salt.</P><P>Why am I and so many other necro's frustrated? Becuase to get a necro or any other character to well past level 50 you have to put in a huge investment in time. To finally get near the pinnacle of your class and gradually come to the realization that you have made a huge error in class choice becuase VI have destroyed your class and made you worthless is pretty damn frustrating.</P><P>Druids cannot claim that they are worthless at all they are valued members of raids for the simple fact that they are jack of all trades, sure they can't CHEAL but the number of things they can do is nothing short of amazing.</P><P>I don't play a druid, never have and never will - the class for some reason has absolutely no attraction for me (that is not a bash just a plain fact). However let me run down the list of things that I know from experience druids can contribute to an ongoing raid....</P><P>1/ Buffs, they have a huge range of ESSENTIAL buffs (circles, POTG? regen's, SOW, SOE etc etc etc.)<BR>2/ Lull type spells, they can calm mobs that might add.<BR>3/ Heals, might not be the best but if the MA is doing their job they are more than adequate.<BR>4/ DD, they have a wide range of DD that actually stick to mobs.<BR>5/ Snare, they can no-summons pull or snare mobs already engaged.<BR>6/ Track, they can keep watch and monitor for potential adds.<BR>7/ Debuff, they have quite a wide range of mob debuff abilities.<BR>8/ DoT, might not be the best but they have them.</P><P>These abilities make druids very sought after in the high end game.</P><P>Now the druids can not only do these things but they are actively encouraged to do so during raid level events.</P><P>What are necros relegated to doing at high level raids? I don't have to say it as everyone knows but I will anyway. Pump Mana. Period. Is that an essential ability? NOPE. In fact just adding another cleric eliminates and more than replaces the necro.</P><P>The real problem with druids is that there are simply sooooo many of them that a lot have real trouble getting into high end guilds.</P><P>I sincerely believe that last statement. If I was Verant I would seriously consider reducing their functionality to try and reduce their numbers to manageable levels.</P><P>But what I truly hope for is not that druids get nerfed. No way in hell should they get ANY of the things they are whining about before the BROKEN classes are fixed though!!!! No what I hope is that the broken classes are actually fixed and reintroduced into the high end game.</P><P></P><P></P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
