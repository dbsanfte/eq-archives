<br>
*A green haze drifts near the great maw on a mountainside,

a place known as Neriak the evil home of the Dark elves of Norrath The

green haze drifts near the entrance and slows to a stop near a large fallen

tree. The silence of the night is broken as a low growl is heard from the

green haze, and a being begins to take form.... a dark elf slowly becomes

more and more solid as the green haze disappears, drawn back within the

dark elf's flesh*</font>

</p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Arrrgh... the pains of transitioning back into the living....

perhaps being non-corporeal does have some benefits.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">*The dark elf looks around the nearby mountainside, admiring

the entrance to his native home of Neriak, feeling safe now that he is

once again under the protection of the Neriak Guards, the beasts shall

not bother him here. The Elf sits down and begins to chant. Small flickers

of eldritch energy dance across the dark elf's body as he continues to

meditate. A short while later the Dark elf opens his eyes and stands. He

casts a shielding spell to protect his newly reacquired flesh*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Olot Dos to the pyramid's undead. They were most fortunate

to catch me unprepared for them. Attacking from behind seems too calculated

for mindless dead. Mayhaps they are not as dumb as they would seem. And

their uncanny loyalty and defense to one another seems to indicate intelligence

as well. I shall study these undead further. For now I swear by mighty Innoruuk the prince of hate, I shall own those undead one night.

Then they shall pay for their arrogance! Attacking me, LIFEBANE THE SERVANT

OF INNORUUK! They shall regret this rash action.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">*Lifebane takes a quick look over himself and seems satisfied.....

he begins to RUN off towards the forest*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">I must retrieve the things from my old flesh... must make

haste before some fiend loots my possessions. I am still weak, how to fix

that.. hmmm.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">*Lifebane notes a fire beetle wandering nearby and a wide

smirk crosses his face.... he begins casting*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Ahh... little one, thou shall do!</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">*Through his necromantic incantation, Lifebane increases

his own strength as he saps the strength of the beetle. The beast quickly

falls under Lifebane's magical onslaught*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Ahh... I fell better. Now.. to find my old flesh....</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">*Lifebane sits for moment and casts another necromantic

incantation, he feels for the lingering remains of his essence and instantly

knows where he can LOCATE his corpse. Lifebane runs in that direction and

shortly comes upon the mangled remains of his former self.*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Hmm... a splendid death at least. Nothing like dismemberment

and decapitation.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">*Lifebane retrieves his things and quickly equips them*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Well then, I am better prepared then before... now let

me even the scales some.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">*Lifebane digs through his pouch and finds only 2 bone

chips.*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Hmmm... not a good sign. I shall have to begin to hunt

for more bone chips. Perhaps those blasted Pyramid skeletons would like

to donate some. Hmmm....</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">*Lifebane grabs on of the bone chips and quickly buries

it into the ground with one finger. He then begins to chant and is surrounded

by an eerie glow... the glow fades.... then all is silent... a moment later

a clawed skeletal hand emerges from the ground followed by the rest of

the skeletal body.. the skeleton lets out a raspy whisper "yes master".

Lifebane smiles at this and hands the skeleton an axe to wield*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Now I think I shall pay that skeleton at the pyramid another

now.... Lifebane runs off towards the pyramid with his skeleton slave following

closely behind....</font>

to see a young Dark elf entering into his quarters. Lifebane eyes the young

one and realizes who this must be... the child of Ixzathul, the one that

wishes to study necromancy.*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Ahh... come closer young one. Sit, pay no mind to the

bones scattered about. What is this I hear, you aspire to become a necromancer

when you grow older? Well then, you are wiser then your years little one,

for therein lies the true power. Necromancy alone has control over that

which all others fear.... Death. No other can bring back the dead to serve

the living. No other can steal the vital life forces of another to better

yourself with. Nay young one, Tis a wise decision you make. Relax, let

me tell you of the wonders of necromancy..</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Necromancy 101-------

<br>The necromancer specializes in hurting others to heal

themselves. They also specialize in the summoning of the dead to serve

their purposes. Eventually they develop powers beyond the scope of this,

but that is to be learned much later in life... for now these two concepts

are sufficient to describe the Necromancers life.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">You will be despised by many, merchants will rarely deal

with our kind, and even then they will tend to abuse the Necromancer with

outrageous rates. But better expensive wares then none I suppose. It is

important to note that many will attack our kind on sight. Beware these

fools, for in their ignorance they condemn themselves. As your power grows,

return and teach these fools the error in their ways! And you have chosen

a hard path indeed for Dark elves are not welcome in most civilized areas,

yet alone a dark elf necromancer! Beware!</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Necromancers are dark, scheming beings who spend all their

time practicing their arts. It is said that most aspire to cheat the inevitable

death through their magic. Perhaps this is true. But this road is a long

road that is full of death, decay, disease, and suffering. Revel in this,

fear it not for it will be yours to control. Death is the Necromancers

friend, disease a tool, decay... ahhh.. decay. A beautiful thing. So much

so that the great god Innoruuk, bringer of plagues blesses all who serve

him. Serve the Plague bringer and revel in the death and destruction. Fear

not the worship of other gods since all the evil gods are allied. The plague

bringer is the natural choice for our trade as is believed by many a necromancer.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Enjoy the suffering you inflict on others, gain power,

amass dark magics... summon the dead to pummel your enemies. All the while,

just stand back and enjoy the suffering. Of course you can feel free to

add to their discomfort by draining their life as they fight your undead

minions. Ahhh... such is the life of the necromancer.... Pain, Death, Decay,

Disease, Famine... these are to you what sunlight, wine, laughter, and

love are to the more frail beings in the land. Let them fear you! Ha! It

is good they do, for at the drop of a gold coin, you would suck their soul

away just to hear their scream of agony. Blood as Ice... never forget...

you are hunted and hunter.. remember this and you will do well. *Lifebane

stops and notices the frightened look in the young dark elf's eyes.*</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Hmm.. Perhaps you have changed your mind little one? Do

not be frightened. The choice is yours...become one of the weak hearted

or one of the strong. Tis your choice.. no harm will come to you if you

change your mind... Go now... think on this little one.</font>

cracks an evil smile...*</font>

halfling, that one will return. And one day, he will be a mighty Necromancer.</font>

of their deity but they are the masters of death and decay and use their

powers to forward that cause. With undead creatures being at your mercy,

you can slay them with ease. Priests of Innoruuk help the warriors of our

cause with healing and aid, or causing the destruction to those who stand

in the way of Innoruuk’s will. Innoruuk (The prince of Hate) has given

those of strong belief in him a portion of his mighty powers to use in

battle and to heal those fighting for his ultimate cause. We also have

strength and a fighting ability to match some of the best warriors around.

Our motivations are our dying beliefs in Innoruuk and his powers that some

day he will take us to serve him personally on his plane of existence.

Our drive as Dark Elf Priests is to become the one true power under our

god. To use others in our climb to the top and crush those that stand in

our way.</font>

  <p><b><u><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF0000">How to role play

a Dark Elf Cleric:</font></u></b>

<blockquote>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">The first thing to know, and I say this from experience,

is that your Wisdom must be high. Yes, you can crack that cracked staff

over something’s head with great strength, but people rely on your skills

to keep them alive during combat.&nbsp; So with your intelligence and strength

combined, you will do the job that Innoruuk has sent you to do. Some say

your disadvantage is your evilness, but think of that as being your advantage.

(evil grin)</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">As a priest of Innoruuk, you’re expected to keep those

around you alive, but don’t let this become your sole purpose in life.

You also have personal goals to fulfill, and quests to go on too.&nbsp;

But while you’re with your brethren, do pay close attention to detail.

Learn for yourself what works best, when to heal and when to kill. You’re

not a magician, so get in the battle if you can, but keep track of those

around you, don’t let them die. I, personally, will take a few good whacks

at the enemy, then back out and start healing my warriors if they need

it. Once I find that I can’t heal anymore, I yell my warning to those trusting

their lives to me, as loudly as I can, and with great meaning. I jump into

battle again, hitting the enemy with all my might, letting out great roars

with every blow. I find that I can do as much if not more damage than those

fighting alongside me, so why be afraid to fight just because I can cast

spells? Depending on how the battle is going, I may even find myself sitting

in the midst of it all to say a quick prayer to Innoruuk. Praying that

He might bless me with just one more healing to save a dying comrade of

mine, or that I might have just one more blast at my prey in hopes of slaying

the beast. The priest is usually the one who calls for retreat, then may

or may not stay behind to ensure the safety of others. Earn the trust and

respect of others so that you will be able to make this call effectively.

Calling for retreat is a big decision, and shouldn’t be done with haste.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">After a long hard battle, you’ll most likely feel the

need to find a quiet spot to sit and pray to Innoruuk…to not only thank

Him for allowing you success, but to also ask for more power so that you

may continue to follow his command successfully.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Somewhere in the depths of Neriak is a place where the

wails and shrieks of the tormented echo through the vaulting caverns of

our deep city.&nbsp; Here is a place where all the stone has been stained

in blood, and where the suffering of the pathetic and helpless saturates

the air, intoxicating.&nbsp; This place is the house of the Shadowknights

of Neriak, where they work side by side with Neriak's Necromancers, the

others who share our passion for death and for pain.&nbsp; Why we come

to this place to learn the arts of violence is different for each Tier'dal

who sets foot in the bloodied chambers.&nbsp; Some, to bring suffering

upon the light races who seek to stifle our glory.&nbsp; Others, to follow

the path of their ancestors, and to serve Innoruuk faithfully, bringing

death as their fathers before them once did.&nbsp; And others, like myself,

simply because they delight in the torment of others, and seek to destroy

every living thing upon the face of Norrath. . .life is indeed a sickening

thing.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Shadowknights share the arcane knowledge of our Necromancer

brethren to bring a greater efficiency to their dispensation of death.&nbsp;

We study side by side with them, but preferring the feeling of blood upon

our flesh, we seek first to learn how to bring our victims to their knees

through perfection of the use of implements of pain.&nbsp; We are not content

to kill with spells from afar, we prefer the frenzy and carnage of the

battlefield.&nbsp;&nbsp; We wish to feel the squelch of spilled entrails

beneath our feet, we wish to look into the eyes of our victims as we send

them to oblivion, to savor the fear and rage that lie within at the moment

of death.&nbsp; We use our arcane knowledge to enrage our victims, and

to steal their life forces, so that we may better subdue them by the sword,

or to call up slaves from beyond the graves to fight by our side, and die

at our bidding.</font>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Regardless of the reason why we have chosen our path,

all Shadowknights share a common bond, of violence, and devotion to the

Shadow Gods, to further Innoruuk's glorious plans for Norrath.&nbsp; We

all share in our hate of the pale filth that lives upon the surface, content

in their false gods, and false peace.&nbsp; As Shadowknights, we all seek

the destruction of this pestilence, to cleanse it from the face of Norrath,

even if we are ourselves destroyed in the process.&nbsp; We render all

unto Innoruuk, our swords and our lives, and do his bidding even if it

means certain death.&nbsp; More often, the rivvil do find that Innoruuk's

bidding means their death, and the death of their children, and not our

own.&nbsp; The day shall come when they cower before us, faces in the bloodied

dirt begging for mercy, and mercy they shall not have, only oblivion.

<ul>

<li>

<font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Although each Shadowknight has their own reason for following

their chosen path, they all share a common hatred for the light races of

Norrath, and would do most anything to harm them, especially the followers

of the false Gods of Light.</font></li>



<li>

<font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Shadowknights frequently choose their path due to a fanatic

devotion to the teachings of the Shadow Gods, and are thus vicious and

cruel by nature, and delight in the suffering of others.&nbsp; They need

no reason to kill, rather, they are usually compelled to do so.</font></li>



<li>

<font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Shadowknights are primarily a melee class, their arcane powers

being used for a tool to help support their melee abilities, not as their

main offensive.&nbsp; They can be very helpful if wisely administered,

but the Shadowknight must always remember that their primary strength is

in their swords and in their hate.</font></li>



<li>

<font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Shadowknights have the ability to call upon undead slaves

to aid them in melee, but they must remember to use these slaves wisely.&nbsp;

They will always be much weaker than the Shadowknight, and if sent in alone,

will nearly always be killed.&nbsp; However, they do provide quite the

perfect sacrificial lamb. . .</font></li>



<li>

<font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Shadowknights are granted a power that brings grievous pain

and the most intense suffering to their enemies, but they may only use

this harm touch once per day.&nbsp; They must learn to use it wisely, and

only in cases where death is imminent.&nbsp; It is foolish to rely upon

it for offensive power, for it will frequently be resisted by creatures

with a much greater power than the Shadowknight.</font></li>
