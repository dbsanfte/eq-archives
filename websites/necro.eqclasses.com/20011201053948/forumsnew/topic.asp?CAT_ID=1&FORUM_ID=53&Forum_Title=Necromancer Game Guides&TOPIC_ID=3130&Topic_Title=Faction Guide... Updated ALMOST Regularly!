        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Ok, had a moderately big and fairly comprehensive faction guide for all of Qeynos written up, and was proceeding to my next remembered faction. However, thanks to Netscape, it's now gone. So, I'll start writing up my faction guide sometime tomorrow, and it will be in MS Word instead of being posted bit by bit. Piece of shit web browsers, I've had IE blow up on me just as much. </P><P>Oh, and I really kinda need the Search function on these message boards to be working so I can find my old stuff and repost it in condensed form. Hard to sort through the few thousand posted messages to find mine. </P><P>I suppose I'll be doing straight reposts for a bit, as soon as I find some faction information that's complete enough.</P><P>EDIT: As a note, and to have this guide make more sense, this is from the viewpoint of a Dark Elf Necromancer, except (possibly) the parts I "borrow" from other posters. I have played only Dark Elf Necromancers, and a bit of an Erudite. This is one of the reasons I invite people to correct me about any faction stuff. Now back to updating my faction guides...</P><P>EDIT 2: Changed topic a bit. First try sucked, changed it again.</P><P>Zharshan Shadowelven<BR>36 Dark Elf Necromancer<BR>The Rathe<BR>Player since: March 16th, 1999</P><P>Edited by - Zharshan on 02/26/2001  22:10:21</font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><b><font size=4>Basic Theory and Practice behind Kiola Nuts and Faction:</font id=size4></b></P><P><b>To make Tumpy Tonics:</b><BR>Buy Kiola Nuts from Sister Island in the Ocean of Tears. Proceed to Kaladim. Give one Kiola Nut and one purchased Water Flask to Tumpy Irontoe, in one of the bars. Repeat until all Kiola Nuts are gone.</P><P><b>Details on the Process:</b><BR>On Kiola Nuts:</P><P>Kiola Nuts cost between 1.5 to 2 gold each (Estimate from when I was there) with around 95-100 Charisma. They are purchased from Sister Isle in the Ocean of Tears. This is most easily accessible from the boat leading from Freeport, as it is the first stop. The Sisters are all on one of the Kelethin factions. Needless to say, you're Necromancer cannot buy these. The Kiola Nuts will fit in all small (not tiny) or larger slots, and DO NOT STACK. They have some weight, but it's mostly insignificant.</P><P>On Water: Fairly simple here. Water is sold in many places, but _NOT_ in Kaladim. If you're doing Kaladim (see later for why you might not), then you have to get your water from elsewhere, or store it in your bank.</P><P>On Tumpy: Simple. Give him one nut, one water flask. Get back one Tumpy Tonic, and some minor experience.</P><P>Time-Saving Methods: You'll need a Goodie class for all of these.<BR>First off, get 8 10-slot bags. The cheapest and easiest bags to get are Deluxe Toolboxes from the Gnomish Pirates in Iceclad Ocean. 1.5pp per box, with 10 slots, .1 weight, and a combine button.<BR>Next, get ONE stack of food, and one stack of any drink. This should last you for a long time. Put them both in the last slot of the last pack.<BR>If doing Kaladim, you should probably buy water somewhere and store 8 packs of it in your bank, for it to be easily accessible.<BR>Once you're at Kaladim, with water and nuts, give them to Tumpy. When out of water, go to your bank and put Tonics in the bank, and get enough water to finish your batch plus one stack (or more) for your next start.</P><P>Teleport Instructions:<BR>To make doing any method of Tumpying most efficient, you will need a level 19 Druid or a level 20 Light-Race Wizard. I used a Level 20 High Elf Wizard. I bound on Sister Island, cleared all of my backpacks except for the food and drink, and bought one stack of Water. Filled up with Kiolas, TPed to GFay, ran to Felwithe, and Tumpied up. Brew barrel in the bottom of the pub, water in one of the stores nearby. Once done, gate back to Sister Isle, and repeat.<BR>For a Druid, you'll probably want to use your Butcherblock teleport. This leaves you closer to the Tumpy option than to easy brewing, so you may wish to do that. Again, bind on Sister Island.</P><P>The Brewing Method:<BR>If you are a skilled brewer (It's extremely easy to get to 136 or so) you can brew Tumpy Tonics in a Brew Barrel. Add one Kiola Nut and one Water. Hit combine. I succeeded about 90-95% of the time with Brewing maxxed on Ol' Tujims. The advantages to this method are simple: If you do not have a Teleport-capable class, then get a level 4 Light caster class, max their Brewing, and get them bound in East Freeport, preferably at the Docks. Wait for a boat, buy the nuts, gate back, and brew in the Inn. Water is sold by the main bartender, so that's easy. You will, however, have to wait for the boat a LOT. Still, getting a caster to 4 is easier than getting one to 20. The other benefits of Brewing is that, if you can click rapidly, you can make Tumpies up to 6 times faster than you can get them from Tumpy. </P><P><b>The Factions:</b><BR>Once you have a FULL bag of Tumpy Tonics, you'll need to GET it to the character you want faction with. I did this by drop-trading in a VERY out of the way place, AWAY from merchants. After you get the bag to your char, there are a couple requirements. First, you've got to have Invis or be liked by Bards, Wolves of the North, Qeynos Guards, and others. Not likely, so make surey ou have invis. Second, you must have Apprehensive or greater faction with the Freeport Merchants, aka CoalitionofTradesfolk. If you meet the above criteria, take your bag, invis, and go sit in the cornet near the brew barrel in the bar near the Freeport docks. You will probably see a seat with Sir Edwin Motte, a Barbarian, or a Dark Elf Rogue there. If you see any of the above 3, sit and wait. If you're high enough level, and want major faction trashing, kill the placeholders. If not, just wait and wait and wait. If you got lucky and found a Dwarf up, by the name of Groflah Steadirt, or if you waited until he popped, go over and get closest to the wall and farthest away from the bard, if those hate you. Give him Tumpy Tonics. Put 4 tonics in the trade window. Add 4 tonics to the NEXT slot. Put 4 in each of the 4 slots, not 16 in one. Hit give. You will get massive faction plusses to:<BR>+MerchantsofQeynos<BR>+KnightsofTruth<BR>+CoaltionofTradesfolkIll<BR>+ColationofTradesfolk</P><P>and POSSIBLY some others.</P><P>Now, to test out how well this worked, invis up and head to North Freeport. Find a guard well away from the zone. Target, but DO NOT break invis. Find a spot WELL away from guards. Get there, drop invis, and quickly con the guard. If he's apprehensive or better, you are now free to walk around 90% of North Freeport.</P><P><b>End Result and Time Spent:</b></P><P>Well, after all of this, you should be able to: Buy from most merchants in Freeport. Travel North Freeport. Be warmly to the Rogues Guild. Be able to buy from merchants in Qeynos, as well. </P><P>I was at pretty much rock-bottom with Knights of Truth, and with 160 tonics I am now warmly. I am warly to ALL of the factions that changed.</P><P>After you have done this, you will have spent AROUND 50 plat, possibly a dozen or so plat more if you Brewed, to make 160 tonics. Since I assigned you to make them in 10-slot containers, you'll probably have spent more, but you can almost guarantee your faction will be maxxed. If you had teleports, and only normal backpacks, it should take you around 2 hours to make a full bag of Tonics. If you do not have teleports, but do use the brewing and 10-slot bag method and use a mule caster in Freeport, it may take 3-5 hours, depending on if Brewing needs to be skilled up. Getting the bags themselves may take even longer. </P><P><b><font size=4>NET LOSS/GAIN:</b></font id=size4></P><P>+CoaltionofTradesfolk (To Warmly)<BR>+ColationofTradesfolkIll (To Warmly)<BR>+MerchantsofQeynos (To Warmly)<BR>+KnightsofTruth (To Warmly)<BR>+Some Other faction (Possibly)<BR>+135 Brewing Skill (if Brewing)<BR>+Noticeable Exp @ Level 20 (If Tumpying)<BR>+Assorted Gold, Copper, and Silver</P><P>-2 to 7 hours of time<BR>-50 to 150 plat</P><P><b><font size=3>Ok, that's it for my first faction guide. 99% of this if from memory, but I've explained it often enough I should have it right. </font id=size3></b></P><P>Note: I may edit this without notice, many faction sites were down when I wrote this.</P><P><BR>Zharshan Shadowelven<BR>36 Dark Elf Necromancer<BR>The Rathe<BR>Player since: March 16th, 1999<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

A lot of gnolls. Really, I mean a TON of gnolls. This will net you good Qeynos factions. An alternate, MUCH faster way is to kill Bandits in the Karanas. They are higher level, but at level 24 you can take two camps at once by solo pulling and letting your pet take care of them</P><P>OrderofThree: Next to impossible. If you want to lose your Qeynos Necro guild faction, as well as CorruptQeynosGuards, and possibly yet ANOTHER faction, go kill Bloodsabres. It will raise your faction with OrderofThree. No alternate methods are known as of yet.</P><P>PriestsofLife: Kill BloodSabres. Alternately, there is an experimental method available: Buy lots of silver bars. Go to North Karana. Find the Werewolf hunters. One of them accepts silver bars, in exchange for faction and a useless item. Not sure what faction this guy is on, or whether his companions will kill you.</P><P>ProtectorsofPine: Uknown, may be impossible. Kill Unkept Druids, maybe?</P><P>JaggedPineTreekfolk: Kill Gnolls. Lots of Gnolls.</P><P>CorruptQeynosGuards: Err… kill Good-aligned Qeynos guards? Possibly some quests that will only trash useless factions, this will probably require a bunch of faction balancing.</P><P>BloodSabres: Kill OrderofThree's or PriestsofLife, specifically ONE of the Brothers in WK near the Qeynos Hills zone. Do their little quests, if you can figure them out.</P><P>MerchantsofQeynos: Kill Gnolls. Shouldn't take very many at all to get to Warmly.</P><P>LeagueofAntonicanBards: Do the mail quest in any of the cities you can until you are high apprehensive. Then you can, if you don't mind probably dying repeatedly, do the Reports quest in South Qeynos.</P><P>CircleofUnseenHands: Kill Bandits in the Karanas until Apprehensive, then do the Cards quest, or, if it will work, spam Hanns with a certain phrase, something like "carson has a mole in Highpass". The Cards quest will KILL your RingofScale faction quite quickly, but it's easy and very fast to do.</P><P>SilentFistClan: Kill Gnolls in Blackburrow. Easy to raise. If necessary, do the Headband quests later.</P><P>That ought to cover most of the NPCs in Qeynos. Moodoro Finharn is on Erudite faction, which is a royal pain to fix at all, and may not be possible to do without trashing Paineel. Perhaps a couple other NPCs somehwere in Qeynos, and there MAY be a CitizensofQeynos faction, which affects Beggars and is raised by doing the Rat Fur cloaks quest. Probably impossible to raise.</P><P>Ok, typed all of this up in Word, now to reformat it for the messageboard. The colors WERE going to be Red, Blue, and Green for each faction, depending on con, but Red is unreadable, and the closests is Pink. I need something more light-red . Otherwise, if I've got anything horribly wrong, let me know and I'll update. Oh, and you will probably see about 57 Edits to this post...</P><P></P><P>Zharshan Shadowelven<BR>36 Dark Elf Necromancer<BR>The Rathe<BR>Player since: March 16th, 1999</P><P>Edited by - Zharshan on 02/22/2001  17:37:35<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

It all OUGHT to work perfectly, in theory. However, due to some missing information, and some things I cannot test, it may not work (Specifically, the Invis while handing items in part. Only invis-capable friend is MIA). However, for dissection, analysis, and perhaps trial, I present what I BELIEVE to be a workable Felwithe/Kelethin faction guide.</P><P><center><b><font size=3>WARNING!</font id=size3></b></center><BR><center>Unlike ALL of my other faction guides, this will cause you to lose faction, probably permanently, and possibly important factions, assuming it works at all. You have been warned.</center></P><P><b>Factions we want to raise:</b><BR>Felguard (Felwithe Guard System)<BR>Felwithe Merchants (Gotta be able to buy stuff, this is not stricly necessary)<BR>Kelethin Merchants (See Felwithe Merchants)<BR>Emerald Warriors (Wood Elf Warriors, and guards too, I believe)<BR>Clerics of Tunare (Felwithe Paladins and Clerics. If Felguard isn't, this would be guard faction)<BR>Keepers of the Art (Felwithe Casters Guilds. Or at least SOME of them)<BR>Anti-Mage (Hrmm.. possibly a Felwithe caster guild, possibly nothing)<BR>King Tearis Thex (Again, I have no idea what this affects. Nor does any faction guide)<BR>SoldiersofTunare (Kelethin Druid Guild)<BR>Faydarks Champions (Kelethin Ranger Guild)</P><P>Those are the most important players in Kelethin, as far as I can tell. Now on to factions to RUIN!</P><P><b>Factions We Will Probably Have to Ruin</b><BR>CrushboneOrcs (This is unavoidable, and also inconsequential)<BR>IndigoBrotherhood (Almost certainly unavoidable, only for Felwithe Merchant faction tho.)<BR>TheDead (This is a big one... Required if you want Felwithe casterst to like you)<BR>QueenChristianosThex (Again, required for Casters to like you)</P><P>Ok, now that we've gotten the summary out of the way... In practice, this will probably be long, tedious, and either slightly or horribly incorrect. The following list is assuming you want ALL Felwithe factions, including Caster's Guilds. </P><P>First off, go to Neriak 3rd Gate. Find a nice, friendly Necromancer. You'll probably have to be high level for most of this faction raising, so here goes. Act like you're hunting for EXP (Who knows, you MIGHT be!) and kill one. I am not positive on the faction hits. If it kills your guard factions, fix those regularly via the Red Wine quest. The others you fix if you can with NO negatives to Faydwer, otherwise you take them. Kill a LOT of Necromancers. I mean a whole lot. No idea how many. Just kill enough that you're dubious to Keepers of the Art. That means trips to Felwithe, to con stuff in the Caster's guilds. Assuming you can GET to dubious, buy a lot of Bat Wings. Get an accomplice who is non-kos in the Magician guild in Felwithe, and can cast invis on you. Proceed by giving as many bat wings as she will accept. This may be 16, it may be 4 (one per slot). Do it using the handy Invis trick (Items in the window, friend then casts invis, hit give, repeat). If this doesn't work, well, you can go back to Necromancer killing. This step here will trash just TheDead, but it will do it FAST.</P><P>Next, assuming all goes well, head off to Lady Shae in North Freeport. You'll need the accomplice again here. Turn in 16 wines, 4 to a slot, until she's nice and amiable or above. This will kill your Orc faction. No big loss. After that, buy a lot of muffins. Tons of them. Fortunately, they sell nearby. Get same accomplice as before. You must be fairly high level for THIS trick to work. Basically, Pandos MUST NOT aggro on you, even while he's at his base faction. I think level 50 should work, probably less. Perform the Invis trick, with 4 muffins per slot, until Pandos is completely warmly. Do it some more, to be safe. </P><P>Next, go and con the guards in Felwithe. If they still scowl, the next step will suck. Get a LOT of bone chips. Find Yeolarn Bronzeleaf. Con him. If Indiff or better, go to him un-invis, with FD ready. If you're lucky, the merchants and guards won't aggro. Give him bone chips, 4 per slot, for a total of 16. Due to the Muffins quest, you should need no helper. Well, you'd BETTER not, as the guildmaster would kill you VERY quickly. Turn in as many bone chips as you feel is necessary: This is raising the two factions I don't honestly KNOW about, Anti-Mage and KingTearisThex. </P><P>After all THAT faction raising, we get into the fun stuff. Go con the guards in Kelethin. I don't know what faction they're on, but it'd be interesting to find out. If they like you, great. If not, there's one more step we need to do anyway. The step is:<BR>Go kill Orcs. Lots of orcs. Loads and loads of orcs. This will kill your IndigoBrotherhood faction permanently. Ah well. Go yell at the faction designers. Once you've killed all the orcs you can tolerate, and then about 5000 more, con the guards again if they were KoS. If they haven't changed faction at all, and the Druids and Rangers and Warriors are different cons, sigh and forget it all, accepting that you just wasted your IndigoBrotherhood faction. If they're all OK with you, check the Warriors. If you have Amiable EmeraldWarrios faction, it's time for the most hideously painful step yet:</P><P>Go collect each of the following, making sure you have equal quantities of each:<BR>spiderling eyes, ruined wolf pelts, bone chips and bat fur. Turn in one each of these to Regren in the Emerald Warrior's guildhall. This ought to give you raises with EmeraldWarriors, Kelethin Merchants, and Felwithe Merchants, as well as lowering your IndigoBrotherhood faction. Seems that's unavoidable.</P><P>Now, if all has been done properly, worked properly, and you've wasted a lot of time, you should be liked by everying in Kelethin and Felwithe EXCEPT:<BR>The Rogues Guild in Kelethin will hate you. Don't know if they wander, no fix I can find.<BR>One of the Bankers, possibly both, MAY hate you. I don't know, this is just a rumor.<BR>Any people that are on "odd" factions, aka those that I haven't figured out or are visiting, will probably hate you.</P><P>Ok! Wasn't that fun? I have doubts anyone will ever try this, due to the faction losses and HUGE time-sink nature of it, and I'll probably never be high enough level, but...</P><P>Oh, yeah. As for the Optional faction losses, you can avoid losing TheDead if you don't want to raise the Keepers of the Art faction. You ought to be able to completely skip killing anything in Neriak, too, if you don't mind the spell-casters. </P><P>There may be faction losses associated with this that I'm not aware of, but from the complilations of various faction sites, and my own recollections from when I was a High Elf, it SEEMS like it should all be as said, and should all work. Oh, yeah, to raise EmeraldWarrior faction without taking a hit with IndigoBrotherhood (only useful if you just want to walk in Kelethin, and not buy/sell in Kelethin/Felwithe), kill various types of Aqua Goblins found in OOT, Dagnor's, and maybe Kedge. Probably the Oasis and Lake Rathe ones work, too.</P><P>After ALL this effort, all of the factions we tried to raise <i>SHOULD</i> like you, sell to you, and give you quests. No guarantees that this will work, at all, in any way, but hey, it's great in theory! I've heard that IndigoBrotherhood is easy to avoid when walking through Neriak, and that many people have ruined it, but I've never tried it.</P><P>Zharshan Shadowelven<BR>36 Dark Elf Necromancer<BR>The Rathe<BR>Player since: March 16th, 1999<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Sigh, I'd like to. I can remove it for now if you want, as I've got a local copy, but you have to be at least level 45 before you can do ANY of it, and as I said, I'm also missing my assistant for the many, many Invis things. So, I should probably kill it so no one ruins their faction un-necessarily. Was hoping someone higher level would take an interest, who had already ruined their IndigoBrotherhood faction, but I guess not :( </P><P>Oh well, so, just kill it if that's what you want to do, I've got a local copy stored with all the formatting. I should get around to confirming whether it works or not sometime in the next two years, assuming I can get interested enough in Everquest to actually LEVEL a lot. Testing some faction stuff is good, like the Qeynos and Freeport areas, and the upcoming short Rivervale faction guide (give bandaids... Easy!), as well as the Neriak, Grobb, and Ogguk guides. Of course, the Grobb and Ogguk may be permanently broken due to the CoB changes, which would suck.</P><P>This faction path is very interesting, to me, but I doubt anyone will be willing to try it until my assistant level 60 druid gets back on, and I can get to level 45 or 50. Every single one of these faction raises is confirmed via Allakhazams, but the two parts that OUGHT to work (Invis turn-ins) may make or break the whole thing. I wish Invis potions worked when in a trade window...</P><P>Of course, maybe you just want to consolidate the guides so far, or are interested in this faction path. I still can't test it... well, hmm... I can only test the turn-ins, actually, by using a Mule at indifferent. Too bad my character slots are full, and I don't have anyone to transfer gold. Oh well, I'll try soon anyway.</P><P>Zharshan Shadowelven<BR>36 Dark Elf Necromancer<BR>The Rathe<BR>Player since: March 16th, 1999<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

The only quests I found to increase this faction were the initiate symbol quests, and no mobs on opposing factions. </P><P>Iksar necromancer here - I'm looking to be able to walk the streets of neriak (and buy coffins) safely.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
