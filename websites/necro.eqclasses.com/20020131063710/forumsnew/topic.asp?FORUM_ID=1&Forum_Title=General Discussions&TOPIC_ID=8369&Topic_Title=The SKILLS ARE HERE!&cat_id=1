        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Holy mother of god.</P><P>APPENDIX D - Alternate Advancement for Shadows of Luclin </P><P>Alternate Advancement </P><P>The alternative advancement system allows anyone who has purchased and installed EverQuest(r): Shadows of Luclin to further customize their high level (51+) characters. Customized features include things such as minor permanent statistic and resistance boosts, unique skills based on your class (warrior, magician, etc.) or archetype (fighter, magic user, and priest), and general skills available to everyone. These skills include anything from enhanced metabolism to improvements in skills already available to your class. You can also gain a title for your character based on the choices you make when enhancing your character. These titles will be visible to other players. </P><P>Gaining these alternate skills and powers will require the expenditure of experience points. You will be able to funnel incoming experience either into your alternative advancement pool or into your standard experience pool. You can even choose to have a percentage of your incoming experience go into each pool. Once enough experience has entered the alternative advancement pool, you will receive skill points that may be used to acquiring your enhancements. When you acquire the proper amount of training points, you will have the option of choosing which enhancement you wish to gain. Some enhancements may have prerequisites. A prerequisite is a skill or skills that you will need to obtain before you can get the enhancement. </P><P>Experience loss due to death suffered by the character will be taken from the "Leveling" experience pool, it will not impact your alternative advancement pool. </P><P>You can access the Alternate Advancement menu by clicking on the ADV button in the inventory screen. </P><P>Note: All characters will be able to open the interface screen for Alternate Advancement. But only those that actually purchase the Shadows of Luclin expansion will be able to earn any of these abilities. </P><P>Also Note: EverQuest is an evolving game. We may add new abilities or change existing ones at a future date. We will, of course, attempt to keep changes to a minimum and will update this document to reflect such changes. </P><P>Unlocking Archetypes and Class Abilities: </P><P>There are three types of Alternate Abilities: General, Archetype and Class Abilities. Each is a stepping stone for the next. Attaining a certain number of General abilities is required before you can learn any abilities from your Archetype. Similarly, you will have to attain a prerequisite number of abilities from your Archetype to start gaining abilities from your Class group. There are also level requirements for each of these levels. Keep in mind that you can't gain any of these abilities unless you own Shadows of Luclin. </P><P>These requirements are in addition to any prerequisites needed for some abilities. </P><P>General abilities: A character must be level 51 or higher to open up the General abilities. <BR>Archetype abilities: A character must have spent six skill points on General abilities and be 55th level or higher to open up the Archetype abilities. <BR>Class abilities: A character must have spent twelve skill points on Archetype abilities and be 59th level or higher to open up the Class abilities. </P><P>Skill Levels and skill points: </P><P>Once you have gained enough experience points toward alternate advancement (enough to fill the experience bar) you will earn one skill point. It is these skill points that allow you to purchase alternate advancement abilities. Each ability will require a certain number of skill points to purchase one skill level with that ability. </P><P>Every ability available through the Alternate Advancement system has a skill level associated with it. For many of these abilities there is only one skill level, meaning that once you purchase the ability you have attained all the skill available for that ability. But several abilities have more than one skill level. Gaining a second or third (or more) skill level in an ability will improve that ability. However, it is important to note that a second skill level is usually more costly than the first, and the third more costly than the second. That expense is rewarded, however. If additional skill levels cost more, the skill level also means a greater increase in the power of that ability. </P><P>Let's look at two examples: </P><P>Improved Natural Strength has five skill levels. However, each skill level for this ability costs one skill point. Each time you raise your skill level with this ability you gain two points of strength. </P><P>Healing Adept (from the Priest Archetype) has three skill levels. Each skill level costs progressively more skill points. The first skill level costs two skill points for a 2% improvement in healing spells. The second skill level costs four points, but improves that percentage to 5%. The third skill level costs six skill points, but raises the percentage to 10%. </P><P>Titles: </P><P>Upon attaining enough skill ranks with the Abilities of each type (General, Archetype and Class), characters will be granted a title to show their efforts. The title for anyone meeting the requirements for General Abilities will be given the title Baron or Baroness. Other titles will be given as the character progresses through their alternate advancement, but we don't want to spoil the fun by giving them all away here. </P><P>Ability Types: </P><P>There are two types of abilities, passive and active. </P><P>Passive abilities are always on and always have effect. Most abilities are passive. In fact, all General and all Archetype Abilities are passive. </P><P>Active abilities need to be triggered by the player. Every active ability has a Refresh Timer associated with it. This indicates how long it will be after using the ability before it can be used again. Refresh Timers are given with two times, in game time and real life time. For every minute that passes in the real world, 20 minutes passes in the game world. </P><P><BR>General Abilities </P><P>The General abilities are available to any character level 51 and above that has the Shadows of Luclin expansion. All General Abilities are Passive. </P><P>Every skill level for every General ability costs one skill point. </P><P>Improved Natural Strength: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Strength by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Stamina: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Stamina by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Agility: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Agility by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Dexterity: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Dexterity by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Intelligence: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Intelligence by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Wisdom: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Wisdom by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Charisma: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Charisma by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Fire Resistance: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to fire by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Cold Resistance: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to cold by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Magic Resistance: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to magic by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Poison Resistance: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to poison by two points. </P><P>Improved Natural Disease Resistance: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to disease by two points. </P><P>First Aid: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the maximum percentage of healing that the character can grant using the Bind Wound skill. The first skill level will increase the maximum by 10%, the second by 20% and the third by 30%. </P><P>Improved Natural Run Speed: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level will increase the character's base run speed. This increase only adds to the character's natural running speed, it will not function with any other speed increase such as Spirit of Wolf or riding a horse. </P><P>Improved Natural Lung Capacity: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the time that the character can hold his breath. The first skill level improves lung capacity by 10%, the second by 25% and the third by 50%. </P><P>Improved Natural Metabolism: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the character's need for food and water. The first skill level reduces the consumption of food by 10%, the second by 25% and the third by 50%. </P><P>Improved Natural Regeneration: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the character's ability to heal. Each skill level increases the character's base regeneration by one point every six seconds. </P><P>Archetype Abilities </P><P>The Archetype abilities are available only characters level 55 and above that have spent six skill points on General Abilities. There are three Archetypes - Caster, Melee and Priest. </P><P>Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers and Wizards can choose abilities from the Caster Archetype. <BR>Monks, Rogues and Warriors can choose abilities from the Melee Archetype. <BR>Clerics, Druids and Shaman can choose abilities from the Priest Archetype. </P><P>Hybrids can choose their abilities from the Archetypes of both of their parent classes (with a few abilities excepted). </P><P>Paladins, Rangers and Beastlords receive both Priest and Melee Archetypes <BR>Bards and Shadowknights receive both Melee and Caster Archetypes. </P><P><BR>Important Note: Some Archetype abilities are restricted and can only be acquired by certain classes. For example, Spell Casting Mastery improves the use of specialization skills. Hybrids don't get specialization, therefore they can not gain the Archetype Ability to enhance specialization. Other restrictions will be listed in the skill description. </P><P><BR>Caster Archetype Abilities </P><P>Abilities from this Archetype are available to Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers and Wizards, as well as Bards and Shadowknights. The first skill level of each Archetype ability costs two skill points. The second skill level of each Archetype ability costs four skill points. The third skill level of each Archetype ability costs six skill points. All Archetype abilities are passive. </P><P><BR>Channeling Focus: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the chances of spell interruption due to damage or movement. The first skill level reduces the chance of interruption but 5%, the second skill level increases the reduction to 10% and the third brings the reduction to 15%. </P><P>Mental Clarity: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the character's ability to recover mana. Each skill level increases the character's base mana recovery by one point every six seconds. </P><P>Spell Casting Deftness: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the casting time for beneficial spells with a casting time greater than four seconds. The first skill level reduces the casting time of these beneficial spells by 5%, the second skill level increases the reduction to 15% and the third brings the decrease to 25%. Bards can not gain this Archetype Ability because they do not have 'casting times' over four seconds. </P><P>Spell Casting Expertise: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level negates any chance of spell failure (fizzle) for spells of a certain level. The first skill level prevents failure of spells under 20th level, the second skill level prevents failure of spells under 35th level and the third prevents failure of spells under 52nd level. </P><P>Spell Casting Fury: (3 skill levels) - Gives the caster the ability to do 'critical' damage with direct damage spells. Each skill level increases the chance to do critical damage with a direct damage spell. The first skill level gives a 2% chance for critical damage, the second increases the chance to 4% and the third increases the change to 7%. </P><P>Spell Casting Mastery: (3 skill levels) - Each skill increases the caster's chance of successfully using his specialization skill for the spell he is casting. This works for all spell types. The result is a reduced chance of spell failure (fizzle) and a greater chance of a reduction of the mana cost for the spell. The increase in the caster's chance to successfully use his specialization is 5% for the first skill level, 15% for the second skill level and 30% for the third skill level. Hybrids can not gain this ability because they do not have the specialization skill. </P><P>Spell Casting Reinforcement: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the duration of caster's "buff" spells. The first skill level increases the duration of buffs by 5%, the second raises the increase to 15% and the third raises the increase to 30%. The only Caster that can gain this ability are Enchanters. </P><P>Spell Casting Subtlety: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the amount of attention casting spells generates for the caster. The first skill level reduces the amount of 'hate' generated by spell casting by 5%, the second skill level improves the 'hate' reduction to 10% and the third improves the 'hate' reduction to 20%. </P><P><BR>Melee Archetype Abilities </P><P>Abilities from this Archetype are available to Monks, Rogues and Warriors, as well as Bards, Beastlords, Paladins, Rangers and Shadowknights. The first skill level of each Archetype ability costs two skill points. The second skill level of each Archetype ability costs four skill points. The third skill level of each Archetype ability costs six skill points. All Archetype abilities are passive. </P><P><BR>Combat Agility: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the character an increased chance to avoid being hit in combat (damage avoidance). The first skill level increases the character's ability to avoid being hit by 2%, the second skill level raises the damage avoidance increase to 5% and the third raises the increase to 10%. </P><P>Combat Fury: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the character's chance for a critical hit (or grants a percentage where none exists). With all three skill levels, non-warriors will approach the basic ability to critical that warriors have. But a warrior with three levels of this skill will retain his a significantly greater chance to critical than any other class. </P><P>Combat Stability: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the character an increased ability to reduce the damage he takes in combat (damage mitigation). The first skill level increases the character's damage mitigation by 2%, the second skill level raises the damage mitigation increase to 5% and the third raises the increase to 10%. </P><P>Fear Resistance: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the character's resistance to fear affects. The first skill level increases the character's resistance to fear by 5%, the second skill level raises the character's added resistance to 10% and the third raises the increase to 25%. This ability also increases the character's chance to break out of fear once it has taken hold. </P><P>Finishing Blow: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the character a chance to kill an opponent with a single blow. The opponent must be fleeing and must have less than 10% of their hit points remaining. The first skill level grants a 1% chance for a finishing blow, the second skill level raises the chance for a killing blow to 2% and the third raises the chance to 5%. Note: classes without a natural chance to critical - which is all classes but warriors - will need to gain at least one skill level of Combat Fury for this ability to work. </P><P>Improved Natural Durability: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the character's natural hit points (hit point total without any buffs or magic items). The first skill level increases the character's hit points by 2%, the second skill level raises the hit point increase to 5% and the third raises the increase to 10%. </P><P>Natural Healing: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the character's ability to heal. Each skill level increases the character's base regeneration by one point every six seconds. This healing is in addition to the increase gained from Improved Natural Regeneration and any natural bonuses to regeneration due to race. </P><P><BR>Priest Archetype Abilities </P><P>Abilities from this Archetype are available to Clerics, Druids and Shaman, as well as Beastlords, Paladins and Rangers. The first skill level of each Archetype ability costs two skill points. The second skill level of each Archetype ability costs four skill points. The third skill level of each Archetype ability costs six skill points. All Archetype abilities are passive. </P><P><BR>Channeling Focus: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the chances of spell interruption due to damage or movement. The first skill level reduces the chance of interruption but 5%, the second skill level increases the reduction to 10% and the third brings the reduction to 15%. </P><P>Healing Adept: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the character's effectiveness with instant effect healing spells. The first skill level increases the effectiveness of the character's healing spells by 2%, the second skill level raises the healing increase to 5% and the third raises the increase to 10%. </P><P>Healing Gift: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the character a chance for a 'critical' healing effect when casting instant effect healing spells. A critical effect will double the healing granted by the spell. The first skill level grants a 3% chance for a critical healing spell, the second skill level raises the critical healing chance to 6% and the third raises the chance to 10%. </P><P>Mental Clarity: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the character's ability to recover mana. Each skill level increases the character's base mana recovery by one point every six seconds. </P><P>Spell Casting Fury: (3 skill levels) - Gives the caster the ability to do 'critical' damage with direct damage spells. Each skill level increases the chance to do critical damage with a direct damage spell. The first skill level gives a 2% chance for critical damage, the second increases the chance to 4% and the third increases the change to 7%. </P><P>Spell Casting Mastery: (3 skill levels) - Each skill increases the caster's chance of successfully using his specialization skill for the spell he is casting. This works for all spell types. The result is a reduced chance of spell failure (fizzle) and a greater chance of a reduction of the mana cost for the spell. The increase in the caster's chance to successfully use his specialization is 5% for the first skill level, 15% for the second skill level and 30% for the third skill level. Hybrids can not gain this ability because they do not have the specialization skill. </P><P>Spell Casting Reinforcement: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the duration of caster's "buff" spells. The first skill level increases the duration of buffs by 5%, the second raises the increase to 15% and the third raises the increase to 30%. </P><P><BR>Class Abilities </P><P>The Class abilities are only available to characters level 59 and above that have spent twelve skill points to purchase Archetype Abilities. Obviously a character can only choose Class Abilities belonging to their class. </P><P>There are two types of Class ability. The first type is similar to the Archetype abilities, with three skill levels. The cost for those types of skills are always the same. The first skill level of these Class abilities cost three skill points. The second skill level costs six skill points.

Lifeburn is good, sure, nice to use on something that's feared, or yes, use HS right after you lifeburn something not feared, then after HS, get ready to FD, dunno....BUT....--Dire Charm--  I'm sure they meant it to say permanent undead charm, not just charm anything. But it says "usual charm rescrictions apply"  um.....unless i'm mistaken here.....but in the midst of bitching about how hard this will be to get....not really hard, just take forever ;))  just relish in the fact that you'll be able to permanently have a lvl 55 undead pet. Put 55 pet haste on him, and um.....<BR>OH<BR>MY<BR>GOD</P><P>As i said, if i'm not mistaken, you can charm up to lvl 55 mobs right?

Heh, wtf. Go charm VS, and then form a hands group. Not to mention the field day necro's will have in HS with this. Then you can work on your skills more and get the "pet mend" ;)) complete heal for your permanent charmed boogie-man with 55 pet haste......Jabober who??</P><P>Jesus, chanters will be having a field day able to charm --anything-- up to lvl 55 permanently.....OMG, chanters can charm high lvl PoG mobs......THAT'S why this is so hard to obtain.....because it's so fucking powerful a skill. That's why it's gonna take lvling from 51-52 27-45 times or whatever you guys said.......This is a very very time consuming and mentally tough thing to go through.....like an endurance test....but the ability to permanently charm any undead up to lvl 55 (if that's true) is insanely GODLY......OMFG, just think of this on Sullon Zek ;)</P><P>Just think of the rewards of this skill for putting so much work into it. This is like the shawl quests...only for the hardcore.</P><P>I think the stat bonus skills are too small. For each skill pt....they should go up 5, not 2. Same with resists. So if you put all pts. into SVmagic, you could raise it +25, instead of just +10</P><P>Horses costing 100,000pp that run at bard speed....and alot of these SoL skills are great. Adding 3hp/tic to your regen...adding +3mana/tic is ok too. Overall, it looks good</P><P>Alot of you people on this board, aren't neutral based, like me. If something truely sucks, you say so, but when something is great, you say so too. Alot of you just like to bitch at anything. Cuz it's like a habit for you now.</P><P>Verant gives you permanent invulnerability<BR>But you have to work for it....</P><P>your response: OMFG, suck my cock verant, this sucks.</P><P>Give praise where it's due, and some of these SoL skills, it's due. The overall new pet look of ours is good. So it has a weird chin and no firey eyes.....you all bash it and say it sucks....you're all too bitter. The new pets look good. So they look like jay leno...so what.
