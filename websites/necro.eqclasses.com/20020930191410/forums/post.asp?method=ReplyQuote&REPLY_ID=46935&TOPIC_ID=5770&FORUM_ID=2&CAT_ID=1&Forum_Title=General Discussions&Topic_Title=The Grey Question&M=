This zone takes some getting used to.  I use a combination of fear-kiting, pet-tanking/slow/Vex/Shadowbond, and root-doting (or a combination of the above) depending on the situation.  The difficulty of the mobs will vary depending on what part of the zone you're in (as with many zones across Norath).

As was mentioned earlier, start near the Mons zone.  The area to the left of the zone along the wall is fairly safe and free of trains if no one else is pulling to that space as well.  The area at the base of the wall up to the hills near the corner is also a good spot for fear kiting.

Make sure you have DMF up in this zone.  It helps not only with enabling you to breathe, but helps with maneuvering around the boulders, etc.  I haven't confirmed this, but I suspect it may also help with seeing the white spots in the sand that mark the 'slug' traps.  You can actually see them moving around like little clouds which is kinda cool.  Walking over these will set them off.  If you have invis up, they will not attack, so don't get freaked out when you hear the trap pop.  The little boulder guys that have been alluded to are a pain.  They are traps that are attached to many of the rocks in the zone (they tend to congregate in the plains extending beyond the backside of the temple, but can be tripped elsewhere).  These little guys summon and are tough to take down solo, but can be rooted, feared, etc.  If you're soloing and run across them, FD and/or run to zone unless you have some support and/or a few more levels, experience fighting them, and plenty of health and mana.

Rockfiends are another hazard.  Best policy on these guys is to root them ASAP, get your pet away, then snare, then fear in this order.  They run at about J-Boot speed, so if you don't have snare on them and fear breaks, you're toast.  Other than that, they just have a ton of HP.  Fear kiting them seems to work best along with a healthy application of DOTs (keep that snare up).  To manage them so they don't get range too far, combine the fear kiting with some aggro-kiting to pull them back to a spot where you can re-apply fear.

After you get used to the space in the vicinity of Mons, I recommend moving steadily to the right of the zone along the wall.  You'll come across two small skelly ruins that are good areas to pull (keep an eye for the slug traps around these).

The slugs cannot be snared so the best policy on these is to send in the pet, keep him Shadowbonded and/or Pacted and then Vex/Bond/Deflux away.  It takes some mana, but can be done since they actually don't have a ton of HP.  If/when the pet starts to get low, move in and start tanking for your pet.  You'll be able to channel through the hits with deflux and should easily come out on top.

There are two ways to deal with skellies and/or snakes.  You can either do traditional root-doting and have the pet finish em off, or you can pull with slow, send in pet, fire off a shadowbond/pact, vex/bond, perhaps another DOT or DD and enjoy the show.  Fear as desired or as pet starts to get low.  You'll find that these guys are the standard fare and will get pretty efficient at killing them with some practice.  Golems are pretty easy too - easily snared, rooted, feared, etc. - not too many hp - they're the cattle of the Grey, just waitin fer slaughter :)

As you move around from the ruins, rotating to the right around the zone, you'll find the mobs start getting a little tougher.  The mobs at the Scarlet Desert side are better exp, but there also are more dangerous concentrations of them that can trip you up if you're not careful.

Stay away from the Undying Iksar unless you have a competent plus 55 couple of people with a lvl 60 puller who knows what they're doing (these can be Tag-pulled best)  They don't see invis, but are surrounded by slugs, rockfiends, and boulderings, and are linked very tightly together.  If you see a train of these lovely skellies heading you're way, run unless you have a good group and it's only a few (/chuckle - it's rare for Undying to come in trains of less than 5-10).

The temple can actually be great soloing and group exp.  To get to know it, I'd recommend starting with groups.  The best way to handle it is to keep the pulls fast and furious.  You're best friend here is your Root line of spells.  Dooming - Enstil - Undead Slow - Splurt - Fear are all mainstays.  Keep the pulls coming, focus the tanks on one mob at a time and root/snare/slow/splurt the rest.  This can be some seriously entertaining fun with a good group :) - with the benefit of an occasional named that can drop some goodies.  When fighting at the front, don't sit in the depression area (that's frequented by the slugs roaming back and forth).  The best spot to sit is on the edge of the depression between the snake ruins and the golems.  ALWAYS keep your eyes and ears open for trains here.  It's common for Temple Raids to have uninvissed tanks running to the zone with plenty of Rockfiends and big skellies in tow.  I swear it seems sometimes that they troll around the zone a while making sure they have enough before trucking through your camp (heh).  Even so, this is an excellent spot and you can even control the trains with some experience and people working together.

One last thing, I might add that this is a good zone to learn to use the terrain to your advantage.  When you have aggro, train mobs across all the big features.  Run across deep valleys, etc. and you will gain some valuable distance.


Hope this helps :)

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> I love this zone for soloing and small groups.</P><P>A few ways to go at it that I like are:</P><P>Fear kiting. Area to left wall of Mons Letalis. As stated above, easy day.</P><P>Regular exp groups. Favorite spot is back of temple or NE corner of zone. Easy pulling and nice cash drops from the named revenants.</P><P>My favorite is charm killing near the ML zone line. Will do it solo, but it's even easier with a chanter for a partner. I usually charm a snake and the chanter a Shimmering Rockfiend. Together they tear through anything quick. Make sure you got Run 3, SoW potions, or JBoots. I also usually give myself enough distance from pet to get an ST off in case of break. </P><P>If solo, make sure to keep target mob rooted while pet carves it into small bits. Root and ST are essential in case of charm break. Make sure you got Run 3, SoW potions, or JBoots. </P><P>That's my two bits.</P><P>Malefico Insatialibis<BR>Defiler<BR>Aei'Desis<BR>Xegony</P><P></P><P><BR>Edited by - Malefico on 07/08/2002  13:16:10</font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Update on how to avoid the little Boulderling bastards.  FDing on these guys can be a pain because of their AoE.  Your best shot will be to run a quick distance away and FD as fast as possible before you get summoned.  I was actually thinking that this might be one instance where Shadowstepping might actually be useful - quick cast spell to get the necessary distance before you pop FD to get them off your back.  Also, the pet comes in useful here.  If you have him up, let them focus on him and then get some distance and FD.  Once they back off now you know where they are and can avoid them.  Recast pet and you're off and running again.  Remember not to waste time while they're taking down your pet - he won't last long.</P><P>I'm guessing these little fellows are soloable with the right spell lineup and persistance.  Since you can get them to focus on the pet the Vex/Bond/Shadowbond/Pact method might work.  I'll have to try next time I run into them.  Even though they don't give any/too much exp, they sure are fun to anhililate because of their annoyance factor :).</P><P>The secret is - if you run into them, already have a plan for what you're gonna do in place, or they'll tear you a new one.</P><P></P><P>Takilth Shadowpath<BR>aka Necrotart<BR>Iksar Warlock of the Final Shedding<BR>proud member of Shining Alliance<BR>Prexus</font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Hmmm....no one seems to like soloing at the SD zone. I've always found it preferable to the ML zone myself (I think wanderers come too close for comfort). Brilliant fear kite pathing (they run more or less parallel to the wall) and absolutely no adds (occasional train yes, but no adds at all). Lots of space to maneuver about with root too. Most importantly, no rockfiends path near there on their own.</P><P>Set up to the left of the tunnel, should be a section of the wall that is smooth. There should be no boulders ahead (used to be able to set up right by the tunnel but the boulder in front of it now holds a rock trap). Run up to the ridge and pull mobs from there. They've now put 2 worm traps there too unfortunately. But there are some ways around them:<BR>1) if you have a pre-nerf CoS, use it. None of the triggered worms or rocks see through invis. Won't be able to use a pet though in the case, but makes for far far far safer pulling.<BR>2) if your particle settings (I think) are set to medium or higher, you will be able to see puffs of smoke showing you where they are.</P><P>There is usually a fairly steady stream of wanderers that head up to the ridge, only one or two will occasionally cross it. Failing that, there are usually skeles littered all over the place from failed kitings. I've always found pulling there to be rather easy for some weird reason.</P><P>I used to love hunting at the Temple. Then the key to VT was found and now random people keep running across the zone and training everything in sight, when it's actually fairly easy to get to the Temple without aggroing a single thing.</P><P>The two ruins that Takith mentioned that are to the right of ML: I just went there last week, and they've just put in a TON of traps around the one nearer ML. Not just slugs, but rocktraps too now.</P><P>Boulderlings are stupidly annoying. They're light blue, hit harder and faster than xakra, and all chain cast that ridiculous spell that xakras use too. I don't think it's really worthwhile soloing them.</P><P>This zone used to be fun, even after repeated nerfings. But this latest nerf of putting a trap under almost every rock has really taken away a lot of the fun in the zone.</P><P>Tenaiya Soulscorcher</font></td>
