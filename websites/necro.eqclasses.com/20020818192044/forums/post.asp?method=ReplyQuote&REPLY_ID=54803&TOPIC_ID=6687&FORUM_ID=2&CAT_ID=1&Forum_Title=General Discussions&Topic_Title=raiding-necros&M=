I personally feel there isnt much to do to fix our class, besides DoT stacking, and I wanna know how other necros look at this.</P><P>DoT stacking-  Of course if we got this fixed, we wouldnt be complaining for a long time :)  (well who in the hell am I kidding there will always be some of us who complain..).  The only problem I see with this is that they would have to re-write the whole engine coding, so I'm guessing this will only be possible in PoP?  If thats the case, most likely we will wind up being what rogues were to velious-- everyone will have a twink necro on their account.</P><P>Lifeburn-  As life burn is currently set up, it cant crit.  Maybe VI could change the skill around so instead of doing a 6 tick, 1500pt heal, it just does a 1500pt life tap?  This would give it the ability to crit, make it a little less dangerous to use it (i'm guessing youd still get low hp agro) and would make it so necros have a fun AA to go for :)  I know this wouldnt "fix" us, but it would help a ton.</P><P>No clue what to call this so this is the name!-  A huge part of high end battles is having enough DPS to go through the mobs health-regen, and do enough dmg to actually lower the mobs health.  Maybe its possible for necros to get a line of spells that lowers the mobs health-regen? say at level 54 we get a spell that does a 25% decrease,  and at 60 we get a 50% decrease?  No clue how VI would look at this, but just shooting out ideas really.</P><P><BR>Sorry for beating a dead horse, and I doubt this post actually makes sense at all, just trying to get a few more ideas out there-- if not new ideas I still like to think about how nice it would be to have DoT stacking..</P><P>~Maelie the Warlock<BR>WWW.SILENTRESURGENCE.ORG<BR></font></td>

Once he has taken damage he, like most high end mobs will summon.  Since he is rooted, you have to fight right under him (can't pull him to a safe spot).  If you fail, you would have to wait till he regens ALL of his HP back before you can proceed with the clean up.  Even if you zone out, the moment you get on his aggro list, you are summoned and beat.  Not really sure how large his aggro range is, but this can take upwards of 30 mins for him to regen.

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> An anti-regen spell would be deadly and probably overpowered for raiding and soloing.  Normal, non-uber mobs regen at the speed of a snail during combat - it's barely noticeable, and really means little in the greater scheme of things.  A mob out of combat regens at ridiculous speeds - mobs could regen 10k+ hp in under 2 minutes from what I observed.</P><P>Why this would overpower soloing:</P><P>Anti-regen a mob.  Put as many DoTs as you can on the mob.  FD.  After DoTs fade, repeat.  You can kill almost anything this way.</P><P>Why it would overpower raiding:</P><P>Zerging.  Anti-regen a mob and bind everyone nearby.  Zerg it and die.  Since the mob's regenning at a very low speed, you can then buff up and zerg again, over and over, till the mob is dead.  No skill required, really.</P><P>Now, assuming that both of these could be worked around, the only use I'd see for this spell would then be on ubers who regen really fast during the fight.  That would make this spell handy - except it doesn't make necros stack at all.  You only need ONE necro to anti-regen a mob.  Thus, I don't think it'd make us generally more desirable on raids at all.  It'd just make having one or two necros mandatory, which most guilds already do.</P><P>Just something to think about.  I think the heart of this post is at the right place, but there are difficulties involved with implementing such a spell, and whether it'd truly solve our problems.</P><P>But say this anti-regen was to go in, what if we made it so the spell lasts for 30 seconds, but has a recast time of 5 mins? That'd mean that in order to keep the mob perma-anti-regenned, it'd take 10 necros, which means a raid could arguably have up to 10 necros and still be operating at maximum efficiency (assuming DoT stacking goes in), and would make necros better over all.</P><P>Personally, there is a feature in DAOC that really would do EQ a lot of good - the idea of "focus" spells.  One caster has to relegate his entire mana pool and concentration just to keep a spell in effect.  This feature could be used to implement powerful, otherwise unbalancing spells.  Instead of one shaman slowing a pull of 5-6 or one enchanter mezzing a whole crowd, it'd make multiple shamans and multiple enchanters stack.  What if a shaman can only keep one mob slowed or an enchanter one mob mezzed? What if this feature was implemented on a level spread, so in exp groups enchanters/shamans can still reliably slow/mezz 5-6 mobs, but on raids it'd be impossible?

In the mean time i will take anyones openion about this over mine seince you guys ahve been playing way longer than i have.</P><P>-Avrorr De`Morte<BR>-46th lvl DE Necro<BR>-House of D'Inex<BR>-Ayon Ro Server<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=284110" target="_blank">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=284110</a></font></td>

Well anyways, here it is...</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=2 face="Verdana" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote>Recently on your...umm...favorite classes website (necro boards...i'm sure you guessed that but figured i'd tell you just in case) a spell idea was proposed.  we have kicked around the idea and argued a bit amongst ourselves to try and balance the spell.  Well I feel it is balanced so I've decided to submit it in.</P><P><BR>So without further adue....</P><P>The spell is a regen reducing spell, specifically meant for boss mob type encounters.  Two spells were originally suggested one being at around lvl 54 or 55 and doing about a 5-10% regen reduction; and another at lvl 59 or 60 and doing in the 10 to 20% range (the amount of reduction while keeping the spell balanced has been the main argument really).</P><P>The first one should have a lower mana cost (around 150-200ish), high agro(slow type agro), and short duration (about a minute).  That one would serve better in groups then raids but still be useful on raids (just due to how often it would need to be recasted and high agro, chances of the necro dying are high).  The second should have a high mana cost (around 400-600), high agro, and last for several minutes at least (personally, i think it should last about the same amount of time that slow does).</P><P>Now some issues are how might this effect the end game?  The answer is really not much...if a guild is capable of doing a mob, this will just make it a bit easier/safer, if a guild is almost able to kill a mob (can get it to around 20%) this might be just the edge they need to finally beat it, but if a guild isn't able to get the mob below even 50% this spell will really have no effect.</P><P>I'll use a quick example with Vindi...lets say Guild A is able to take vindi down easy; 30 people and about a 7 or 8 minute fight.  With this spell they should do it now in about 5-6 minutes. </P><P>Now Guild B is close to killing vindi with around 50-60 people, but they always seem to fail around 20-30%.  With this spell they *may* now be able to finally kill vindi, but it isn't a definite still.</P><P>Now Guild C tried vindi a few times with around 50-60 people, but could only get him to around 80%; with this spell, they might be able to get him down to 60%...but the issue is that until they gear up their MT a bit more so he can handle vindi's output, they aren't going to get him very far.<BR>--</P><P>Personally, I think that is a good example about how the spell might effect the higher end gaming.  Another issue that came up on the necro boards is could this spell be used to zerg?  the example someone gave was that you cast this and all charge in and die...then rebuff and keep doing it; but with the insane regen that boss mobs have that isn't even an issue...a 20% reduction in regen rate means they will simply be full HP in 3 minutes rather then 2.</P><P>And the other question is; what can necro's do with this solo?  Someone said that we could regen slow, DoT, FD...wait for DoTs to wear off, get back up and reapply.  The amount of time this would take to kill a regular exp mob would be about twice as long as it would normally take and the necro would only be doing one instead of the 2-4 we normally do, so in that instance it would be slower.  The other issue is what if we try that on a named or some such that normally takes a group?  Well any 55+ mob that we couldn't do before is most likely a summoning mob.  If you try this method then as soon as the DoTs wear off and you get back up to refresh, you are going to get summoned...and seriously, if the necro in question is uber enough to channel their DoTs and FD through a 55+ named melee; well personally i don't think a necro could unless they have about 3k unbuffed HP and full raid buffs and even then i don't think one could (and this makes up about 1% of the necro population).</P><P>---</P><P>Well, I guess that is all.

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Three points abilister:</P><P>1. How fast do high-end mobs regen? Anyone have any HARD numbers on this? It's been my impression that certain mobs regen at amazing speeds even while in battle (Cazel), while others regen for jack even outside of combat (Velketor before he was buffed to prevent zerging, if I recall).  It sounds that this spell would be totally worthless in groups, because mobs you'll be fighting in groups regen at such a slow rate in combat and the fight will be over so soon that a 5-10% reduction every 6 seconds on the mob's regen means nothing.</P><P>Example: Let's assume your average 6k hp mob.  A typical fight with a mob like that lasts 1 minute.  10 ticks to one minute.  In order for this spell to be worth its casting cost (200 mana) it has to do around 500 damage, agreed? 500/10=50 regen stopped per tick.  If 50 regen was 10% of the mob's regen, then the mob would have to be regenning at 500/tick (or 5k per minute, which means Funeral Pyre AND Pyrocuror AND Epic stacked would not even overcome its regen!)  That's absurd.  If it was regenning at that speed our DoTs would do jack against it, and froglok dar knights would own most early 50's groups.</P><P>2. In truth, all the second spell would do is to be an uber DoT that only works on high-end fights.  I'm assuming that was the intended purpose, an uber DoT on high-end fights, in which case why not just make an uber DoT on high-end fights instead of asking for this? It seems to me this would be difficult to implement, seeing how there is no single damage-based spell in the game that works off of percentages.  Slow does, sure, but for all we know slow and haste could be on a totally different scale than most spells.</P><P>3. The only way this could help necros get guilds is if it made a HUGE difference in most fights AND could be maintained, due to its mana cost, by only the full effort of one necro (otherwise you'd just have the local uber necro casting it once and then DoTing as usual).  </P><P>Sure, this *would* be nice to have in theory, but without any hard numbers to back it up there is no telling what imbalance this may bring to the game.  Anyone know how fast the Arch Lich regens during combat, for instance? 1k/tick? 2k/tick? 3k/tick? As far as I know player regen isn't based on percentages (it's a flat number), so is there any reason why a mob's would be other than it seems like it? You need hard numbers to back up this spell, and that's something I haven't seen in this post at all.</P><P></P><P><BR>Etadanik the Redeemed</font></td>

If monster regen is far lesser, or far greater, than we presumed it to be, then yes, this spell could be broken as well.</P><P>Now if VI sees this and believes they could implement it without under or overpowering the spell, I'm all for it.  Given the lack of numbers on monster regen, however, there are simply too many variables at stake for me to believe that this spell is easily feasible.  I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but that for it to be a feasible idea, there must be facts to back it up.  <BR>    <BR>Alot of ideas would be "nice": why not a spell that reduces mob damage? Why not a spell that makes mobs *miss* 50% of the times? Why not a spell that vastly reduces a mob's AC so tanks hit for 30% more damage? All could be potentially useful, but the thing is they are *new* ideas, which means adding a whole new line of spells in the game, and as such they require a HUGE justification on our part.  Modifying existing spells is easy, and doesn't really upset the existing balance of the game.  But adding something new is *always* potentially destructive.  Look at the paladins, for example, and their "silence" line that had to be completely nerfed b/c of its devastating effects.  It's been my experience that EQ has a tendency to sway towards opposite sides - either a spell is too powerful (Slow, CH) or it's worthless (lots of candidates here).  Making a spell "just right" is difficult, and even more so when you don't have any facts to back it up.  That's why I responded skeptically.  If we had some facts to work with, it could prove interesting to try and find a balanced spell line to possibly present to VI, but otherwise, there's really not much we can do except mention it as a possibility, like the hundreds of other ideas we've seen on this board over the past years.</P><P><BR>Etadanik the Redeemed</font></td>

If this is true, the zerg scenario is a possibility if you just keep comming after dieing and someone is fighting at all times.

It wouldn't be better than a chanters top stuff, thus they wouldn't complain,but we would be more useful and even better soloers.</P><P>I would also like to see critical damage for dots but personally would prefer some AA EP that would reduce casting time on life taps and increase life taps with criticals as well as add criticals to our heals as with the shmaman AAEP.

Twitching = out the window with ModRods.<BR>2. Corpse Summoning = Oh hi summoning robe.</P><P>Basically our main duties in raids now are Dot like mad/escape.<BR>Right now when we look at recruitment of new necros which is really rare... We look at 2 things... Do they escape? And do they have a Velious robe.  Which is really shitty.<BR>Our class skills are a joke raid wise.  Life burn? happy 5k nuke max.  </P><P>Now the other thing, Doting.  Ive made a previous post about that.  We can reach dps's of low 100's which in actually really really good.  Right around wizards.  If they fixed dot stacking (I dont think they will) we would become looked at as another source of quick easy massive damage, which is what we would be.  But the problem is theres two type of necro views on this.  1.  The up and comeing Necro who wants to be part of these raids.  2.  The High end necro thats already in these raids.  Hehe beleive me its easy street if you manage to get in.  Not much for defaulted items anymore BUT.  If you look at necros in those guilds than like a wizard.  They are on average better equiped.  Im rambling.  Fix dot stacking that will make us good.</P><P>Also.. The idea of us Killing regen.. yeah that sucks just because ONE NECRO doesnt solve anything.</P><P>Edited by - Lukein on 08/03/2002  07:08:38</font></td>
