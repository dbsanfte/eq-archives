Lvl 8-16
Various mobs in eastern commonlands, western commonlands and northern desert of ro.

Lvl 16-20
Fallen iksars in timorous deep, nice place and the mobs drop money and research material, and no trains like in oasis.

Lvl 20-27
I did spend this time in the overthere killing east of the outpost, fairly okey xp at first but slow in the end, there is a dark elf merchant across from the bank that gives way better cash for your loot so don't sell to clockwork merchants.

Lvl 27-29
Netherbian lair and troglodytes, pull them with darkness up close to exit to dawnshroud peaks and fear kite, i pulled fairly slow here trying to avoid adds, fairly okey xp and nice money.

Lvl 29-34
Great divide hunting tizmaks, they drop velium weapons, tizmak armor and research stuff but no money

Lvl 34-36
Dreadlands yeti caves

Lvl 36-44
Think i was in overthere at the ledge most of the time, also killed some giants in great divide and some fighting in dl.

Lvl 44-49
Dreadlands and plaguebones, plagubone thiefs, also more giants in gd and kael, also some xp in cobalt scar from wyverns.

Lvl 49-51
Cobalt scar hunting wyverns mostly, but done some giant hunting in gd to gain faction with claws of veeshan(dragons), also spent about 2 hours in velketor and maybe 1 hour in sebilis and perhaps 30 mins in kael casting lvl 1 lifetap for faction :) .

This is roughly the path i have taken, now you could probably go to places like paludal caverns around 20 or so for great xp.

THIS IS THE LVL TO 60/GAMING LIST. Not related to RP at all. (never RPed before...)</P><P>Anyways, you will be allowed to bank in Freeport. Just crappy merchant faction (they won't sell to you) is all. Your a human born into Freeport. They will except you no matter what class ya are=). Its just the stupid merchants lol.</P><P>Far as hunting grounds go. Stick with West Freeport newb yard till 5 (or lvl 6 if your in for SLOW xp and the rare wolf). Head out to East Commonlands. Solo random walking shit, firebeetles, wolves, low lvl pumas, black bears ect till you hit lvl 7ish. Group up in an orc camp (orc camp 2 spawns much quicker now from my twink's exp) till about lvl 9-10. It's shitty xp, beware. After hitting about 10 head over to North Ro Desert. Walk around the Desert area till you find a tunnel. If your server's auction zone is EC then you'll see quite a few people around midday America time. LFG for a derv camp, Duo/solo random things like zombies, roaming orcs, cyoties, spiders, beetles. Till you hit about 12-13. Head to Oasis. LFG or Duo Caimans along the shore. Once you hit about 14 look into soloing Orcs on the highway OR join a group. Usually 1 or 2 sharing the main highway and 1 or 2 along the shore near the derv camps. Not much use to a necro till about 20-24 when you have twitch, mez, snare, fear, a pretty nice pet ect. Once about 18 or so head to OT. LFG at the mud pits till lvl 20ish. Head over to Lake of Ill Omen and solo sarnaks, goblins, iksars and other things. Or LFG at the mill till about 24. Then look into a Sarnak fort group=). Thats good till lvl 30... If your bored hit 25 and head to Frontier Mountains. the giant fort is decent for lvl 25-35 but this can get slim. Return to OT and lvl up to 40 or high 30s. Bounce on over to the Dreadlands, LFG at Karnor's Castle walls or solo drolvarg, gorrilas, spiders ect till mid-upper 40s. Head into shitty old KC itself. I have seen lvl 48-60 LFG here. I think the upper guys would look into a basement group. But you should solo the ent dogs about 54. Once you hit about that lvl or 55 I'd head over to Sebilis. To get those keys you have to find a tracker. Kill 2 frogloks then take those peices to the Emperor guy. Then you have a Trakanon Idol. With key on cursor click the red bubble and your into Sebilis. LFG there. You should not look into soloing the enterance frogs unless you are about 57 or lower with epic... Or atleast decent hps or ask for cleric buffs. People usually look for you as a ghetto mezzer, snarer, twitchwhore, undead slower for crypt, group/backup healer, or a puller. Be expected to do more then one at a time. Usually twitchwhore/snare is what you'll mainly do. With lich on make sure that you keep Taping or Defluxing. Vexing Mordinia comes at 57 or 58 don't remember... Also Hate Plane xp farming groups and Fear Plane soloing are great xp. Have a lvl requirement of 46 and I wouldn't want to solo that stuff unless you are about 50 or so. Also High Hold Keep has nobels and a bard or something you can solo. Great xp/loot at lvl 54ish. </P><P>If you need money, farm farm farm. Great places like RM mountains, CC geonids, SF in OOT, Ice Giants in Everfrost, Giants in BW. Depends on the cash flow/farming skills you have=). But remember. These camps are known and favored for alot of druids and necros... the 2 big farming classes. </P><P>I hope you enjoy your necro, whatever the hell the race is. If you need more crap answered just /tell Tsami on Xegony=p.  Never see any low necros on here on the same server. </P><P>BTW the lvl climb I just told ya is a common road=). NOT EVERYONE does it. Plus its mostly Kunark outdoor bullshit. not the road I took but if you are up for gaming and quick lvls I'd go with it. To be apprecaited in Sebilis and Chardok and whatever other dungeons... Have good group skills=). Plus if you fight in Karnor's Castle or Howling Stones WATCH OUT. Big damn faction kill on Overthere (OT). I'll promise you. If you ever get the hammer that gates you to the Outpost for quick banking or ever do the spell turn ins you will thank yourself for that faction. Once you fuck it up its gone=). Runs on Venril Sathir and Overthere faction.</P><P>Good luck.</P><P>Warlock<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=250690" target="_blank">MY SHIT</a><BR><a href="http://www.vicious-arrogance.com/AO/Pics/Band/Dani/danicorpse.jpg" target="_blank">Ack!</a><BR><a href="http://www.vicious-arrogance.com/AO/Pics/PanDaemonAeon/42.jpg" target="_blank">It's me.</a></font></td>

If you want to do business in Neriak, stay out of Crushbone (or only kill slaves) and don't kill blue orcs.

I am a level 5 now there and have twice the loot I had in Nek Forest and can actually see better, even with being a DE it is a pain there as far as I am concerned.<BR>Have learned to LOVE those "Plague Rat Tails" that sell for 1p.6g.7s!!!!!<BR>I now have ALL my spells and ALL the level 8 spells also, just for running around chasing RATS...LOL!!!!<BR>Probably will run my DE Necro to EC after she hits 6 and play around there for awhile. At least with a couple of merchants in tunnel to sell to, I don't have to kill my pet every time. That zoning to EFP and to the tunnels is a BIG PAIN!!!<BR>Have a good one all...Oh BTW I got my lil "Darkmystt's" INT up to 143 now, is that good??

Darkmysst is now a level 6 and since I have pretty much wiped out the newbie yard in WFP am going to wander over to EC and see what can NOW bite me in my cute butt!!! Pretty much everything don't ya think...LOL!!!<BR>Have collected some pretty good rusty weapons, so when I get there my Boney Pal will have a fighting chance along side me also.<BR>I probably can't trade with the merchants in the huts, but EC Tunnel is there, so that will help the weight issue. Since I have slayed a zillion orc pawns in the newbie yard, hopefully they at least won't kill me anyway if I try to do business with them at the huts. One in particular I had better stay away from is: Joseph the Blessed or what-ever his name is in that first hut upon zoning...that merchant would definately make my day probably...:(<BR>Well ya all have a good one and keep on keeping on!!!!!! ;)</P><P>"Mistress of the Dark"</font></td>

Click on the Name change area and it will take you to their rules, regs, what names you can do, what are not considered wonderful by VI, etc, etc, Rinse and Repeat. You then /agree to their terms and it takes you to an area where you put your Original Name...then the next box over is the name you are requesting and then the server you are on.<BR>When I went from Sanadarii to Darkmysst it took about 2hrs for me. I am sure that is unusual, because the email you get usually says alot longer. I was in game with Fayanarose my lil halfling Druid when I get this tell from a GM to please log and let him know how long I will be out. It happened so fast I had to ask what for!!! LOL!!! He said for your name change, Ah I say, I will log out and come back on in 5-10 he said /thank you.<BR>That was it...boom log back on and there she was with her NEW name.</P><P>"FYI"...I saved up all my change over the year and found out I had over $300 to play with /woot, so that's why I don't feel guilty about spending the bucks!!!! Saving change is pretty cool, has also gotten me a new "XBox"!!!!!<BR>Are ya thinking of changing your name?<BR>Have a good one my friend ;-)</P><P>"Mistress of the Dark"</font></td>
