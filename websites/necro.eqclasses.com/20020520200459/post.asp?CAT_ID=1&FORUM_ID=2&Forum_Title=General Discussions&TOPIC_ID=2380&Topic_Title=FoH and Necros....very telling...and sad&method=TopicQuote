I followed the FoH link someone posted about the Seru killing.  Since I was there, I decided to poke around a bit.

I was looking at the roster; aside from Beastlords, guess which class they have the fewest of.

Yep...Necromancers.

Then I looked at their recruitment needs.  With Necromancers being the least prevalent class, they still rated their need for more as ZERO.  Not low...not very low...ZERO.  As an added slap, the requirments for any Necromancer applicants is that they be able to tolerate insults forever.

Now, say what you want about FoH, but they do know how to play EQ and they should for requiring their members to commit 30+ hours a week to the game.

Ask yourself, if aguably the best tactical guild in the game has determined there is zero need for necromancers, isn't there something wrong?

I'm not seeking a flame fest...but it is more that a bit depressing.  Maybe I'm missing something...feel free to show me what.

A necro twitching a cleric is just about 1/3rd of a cleric.  Why in the world would a guild invite 1/3rd of a cleric? The only reason necros get invited at all is because they have a few abilities that makes life a whole lot easier - DMF, Corpse Summon(esp. mana free corpse summon with robes), etc.  You don't need more than one necro for that, so why add more necros? If DoTs stacked, a guild MIGHT consider adding necros as damage dealer, but even then, it's a toss up between whether DoTs do carry enough DPS to warrant accepting a necro instead of, say, a rogue or uber-ranger.</P><P>A few guilds make exceptions, obviously, but they don't necessarily do it because they need necros.  Triton is a great guild, no doubt, and they make use of necros, hooray.  Yet FoH and AL do just fine with one or two active necros.

        <TD bgcolor='dimgray' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'> FoH is a very specific case and you can't really judge everything (or anything for that matter :>) on what they do.  They do what they do by min/maxing basically.  Bringing as few people as needed, yet with the highest damage per second possible.  That means rogues, monks, and rangers (rangers dual wield, plus they have insane ATK buffs) for melees.  Wizards for casters.  Warriors as MTs.  And of course, Clerics.  You don't want anyone there that isn't "optimum" as far as DPS goes.  Otherwise people start going LD.  But, **** FoH for now.  They are unique, they do cool ****, before anyone else, but their "culture" is, it seems, to me, rather un-fun.  So who cares ;p</P><P>Other "uber" guilds do have Necros and do respect them.  Savan from Afterlife posts here.  And Triton's NecroTrio post here too.  They don't seem like they're unrespected in their guilds.  (Of course, Triton is lead by a Necro ;p) No, you don't need 10 active Necros in a guild like you would Rogues.  Necro damage (except for Lifetaps and our crappy ass nukes) isn't additive.  In general, for straight damage, 5 Necros is the same as 1, if you discount Taps.  (Though Touch of Night with Mage dmg focus and Spell Crits isn't all that jokey, if you've tried it).</P><P>As far as twitching, people need to stop bitching about it.  It's something we can do, it's something that has its uses, and it's something that has to/should be done AT TIMES.  The difference between a good necro and a twitchbitch is knowing WHEN.   It depends on the fight, and it depends on your Clerics.  I don't twitch Shamans on raids (they can get mana back faster than me, they can kiss my ass). As far as pre-raid twitching, sure, it's a great buff-time reducer and I do it.  Frankly, with Arch Lich changes, our mana regen @ 60 is so insane that it don't matter how much we twitch.</P><P>The clerics I work with know how much mana exactly they get from a single twitch-round (I double-cast 2 spells, Sedulous and Covetous).  When a fight gets close and a cleric wants to hold their mana at a certain level they can ask me and I'll hit em or not, depending on how the fight is going.  They know they'll only get one double-cast and they're fine with that.  Our guild has no ModRod2 mages (and only 2 mages anyway), and we all know ModRod1 sucks ass, so... Necros are the only mana source other than medding.</P><P>Another nice way to help out w/ mana now is with Mind Wrack.  If you're fighting something that has mana, use it.  It works now and everyone I've used it with loves it =)</P><P>As far as damage, heh.  My usual raid group is me, my wife (60 rogue), a_cleric_from_the_guild01, a warrior, another rogue, and usually a druid, a ranger, or a shaman.  I control the exp in most fights. :>  If I don't chaincast Deflux/ToN, we don't get exp.  If I do, we do.  I usually put in quite a bit of damage.  Sure not as much as a Rogue or Ranger or such, but still quite a bit.  It's enough to tip the exp scales.  I don't get aggro as I have Casting Subtlety 1 and I FD every now and then.  I've never pulled aggro and when I say Chaincast I mean *CHAINCAST*, hehehe.</P><P>There's a lot of other crap we can do that's very useful to a guild, but again it's not *additive* like when you add another Rogue, you up the guild's DPS.  That's ok, we work in different ways :></P><P><BR>/wave Xuraz ...

        <TD bgcolor='dimgray' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'> I started playing a necromancer so I don't have to be in an uber-guild to have fun.  I don't have to get uber-equipment to kill things. I don't have to find a group to kill things.  I don't even need two bone chips anymore.  </P><P>I can log on naked and start killing blue things within 5 minutes or so....which is a nice feeling compared to leveling up a Paladin (my first char).  I can do what I want, hunt solo or grouped, Pharm or XP, twitch newbies, fight with no downtime, or with extensive downtime....adapt my play-style to suit my current mood & schedule.  No other class has the same amount of flexibility on the path from 1-60+AAXP.  Playing a necromancer made EQ sufficiently fun that I didn't cancel my account (which I was about to before I started my Necro).  My necro became my main char, and has remained my main across 5 servers now.</P><P>But the way the necromancer class is currently structured, there is never going to be a demand for more than one or two necros on a highly optimized raid of the sort conducted by FoH.  We will never be a recruitment priority after a guild has several active accounts with that class.  We could be improved on raids, and I would welcome that improvement, but we will never be in the Cleric/Warrior/Rogue/(and sorta Wizard-at least nowadays) class when it comes to uber-guild recruitment priority.</P><P>But we are not alone. Druids and Mages have even more limited roles on raids. Bards are just as 'unnecessary' as necromancers, and to the extent they are useful, one is about all thats needed.  While monks, enchanters and shamans are necessary for most raids, they are in the same boat as necros with regard to 'stacking'-no more than 2 are ever really needed.  The hybrids are less handicapped, but not as useful as warriors.  Paladins and shadowknights have lower DPS and HP than warriors, and rangers have serious survivability issues.  And don't even mention beastlords-the most gimped class when it comes to raids.</P><P>The way the post-leveling-all-raid-all-the-time-game currently works is a _general_ EQ problem, not a necro-specific problem.  Almost everybody has the same 'problem'.  And I'm not sure its much of a problem.</P><P>How much fun is it, really, to assemble the optimal raid force to take out an uber-mob?  Its really just a big time sink:  Level X number of warriors to L60, X number of Rogues, X number of clerics, etc...Then pharm dungeons/lesser-uber-mobs/planes/etc...to outfit them...then raid...etc...</P><P><BR>For me the fun comes from discovering new things--like how to accomplish a task with the resources currently at hand.  And THATs the main reason the necromancer is so much fun.  Despite the class' problems, our spell line is so varied, and our abilities are so extensive, there are apparently an infinite number of viable options, whether solo or grouped.  I've been playing necromancers for three years, and I am still learning new things about how to use our old spell lines in combination.  AAXP and new spell lines are throwing new wrinkles into the mix, too.  </P><P>Whenever I fill out my 8 spell slots, I'm STILL having trouble deciding how to fill them out post-50. Every other class I've played I have always known exactly what to use in every situation. But necromancers just get too many options....most of us find ourselves swapping spells in and out all the time...even in the midst of fights, as we adjust to changing circumstances.</P><P>FoH doesn't want any necromancers...so what?  We don't exactly need them for anything.</P><P></font></td>

Check pre-Kunark...Necros were probably one of, if not THE most powerful class around along with monks. That's why you saw a lot of necro/monk twinks.

Oh, and bards only had one song, and that was mana song :P</P><P>I'm not a portable mana source :P I have more abilities than that, and that's why I'm not going to join a guild like that. With DoT stacking, let's face it, on most raid mobs, you ain't gonna DoT, the only thing that will last optimum time on most raid mobs is Ebolt, and maybe not even then. I generally chain cast Deflux or the undead nuke we get for undead mobs (yeah, it's slow as, but fairly cute). Also supplement the melees in my group with Dgen and CripClaud (one guy was in another group next time, and he asked me to cast it on him, lol :)) and if I have a wizard in my group, if he/she goes low on mana and I've got some spare, I give em some. The group I'm in normally gets a decent amount of KSing until the raid leader realizes it and starts breaking us up :P</P><P>For big mobs, as an earlier reply also noted, necros start applying different DoTs to the mob, depending on level and spells they have. I blush to admit it, but as one of the smallest necros in the guild at the time, I was casting Ebolt and Plague. Means I guess that you could have about 6-7 necros all casting one DoT, and then just chain casting Deflux/ToN.</P><P>I'm not totally anti twitching, Subversion is a spell I always mem. But I'm more than a twitch bitch. And I'm not going to be assumed that's my only function in a group or on a raid.</P><P>I think it's about, as others have also said, how you play your necromancer, and how your guild utilises you. I mean, I was playing mezzer when all the chanters died. Nervewracking, but I did it. I guess, also looking at guild who give you a (very restrictive) job description, and bitch when you go out of it.

Sure, other classes do more damage on most mobs but if the fight is of any length the necro who lands all his dots then chain nukes has a good shot of matching/surpassing the rouges/wizards.  If more then one could provide that damage there would be no reason not to bring more along.  This isn't the golden years of EQ where you have to worry about groups consisting of just necromancers breaking planes or killing raid dragons.  Multiple casters utilizing thier dot DPS isn't going to throw off the high end game because as it stand now instead of stacking dots people are stacking melees.  Maybe raids could actually happen if there were enough 'people' around rather then enough 'melee's' or 'Clerics' or such.  Sure the old tactics would survive but then off groups and guilds that form for better reasons then "MT/CH rotation is most effecient, I'm going to make a guild and recruit people around that concept regardless of thier personality just because of efficency"  Imagine any of the iksar only guilds out there being able to take out tough mobs because they had enough monks/necs/BLs to deal damage and the shaman's could keep everybody alive because nobody needed a CH, using pets to help absorb some of the damage....  Oh wait I just woke up I must still be dreaming sorry.... <img src=icon_smile_sad.gif border=0 align=middle></P><P>Also, Realize that people like FoH are always going to find people "un-neccicary".  There are 15 classes, and at least one of them is going to be the "worst".  Some guilds form because they like the people they are guilding with regardless of class.  Those guilds will accept anybody regardless of your class and will let you hunt with them/raid with them regardless of perceived inabilities.  Thoes are the guilds that matter.  Sure people will remember FoH as the uberest of uber, but its pretty much universal that the rest of the game thinks they are stuck up snobs who don't care about individuals, only about crunching numbers.  Plenty of other guilds out there will be remebered for thier fair attitudes and plesant atmospheres.  Once you realize you will probly never own every piece of gear or kill every mob then you begin to understand how rediculous all this min/maxing is.  Play classes you like for image reasons.  Go play the game and explore.  The more time you spend looking at the numbers the less fun the game gets.

Enchanters, speed, slow, rune if necessary, some stat debuff. Wizards, dmg. and TLs of course. Mages, mod3 and pets. Paladians, melee dmg ds loh. Monks, pulling. Bards, mana song, stat song. Necros, way to many to fuggin list, see ALL above. If your a Necro and you dont wish for 10 more spell slots you need to rethink your choice to be one.

I can CR any zone better than any other person in my guild , i can heal my group on AE raids. Im often in the MT group for the extra group buffs ( atk,ac mostly ). Clerics love me for mind wracks as it helps no end with their mana regen. I can solo **** no other class can even look at seriously. And with funeral pyre i have to watch how many i load because i end up with far more aggro than any melee on the raid if i get careless or bored :)</P><P> Fact is necros own. Period. If you dont wanna play a necro just because all you think your class can offer end gaming is 'twitch' then you should give up now and make a rogue like all other gimps.

        <TD bgcolor='dimgray' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'> That patch was an April Fools joke :P</P><P>But anyways, just because DoT stacking is implemented, doesn't mean guidls are going to start recruiting massive amounts of necros.  It just means that necros will actually be happy to raid with each other and not have to worry about lessening each other's effectiveness in the process.  It means that guilds might actually start recruiting a few more friendly necros, instead of trying to "not spread the loot around" because necros don't contribute too much.  It will certainly make raiding necros' lives much easier, make multiple necros feel less powerless, and bring some balance to the unbalanced state of DD's and DoT's.  Frankly, there is no reason why DoT stacking should NOT be implemented except for the possibility that it might trivialize some fights, in which case, all I can say is buff the fights.  DoTs not being able to stack has been a mistake since the beginning of EQ, and to not remedy such a wrong because it might upset the balance so carefully piled ontop of this fundamental error is, frankly, cowardly.  </P><P><BR>Etadanik the Redeemed</font></td>

He knows the strengths and weaknesses of the players. LOS and FOH know they stuff. They do **** that most of the people on this board never dreamed of.
