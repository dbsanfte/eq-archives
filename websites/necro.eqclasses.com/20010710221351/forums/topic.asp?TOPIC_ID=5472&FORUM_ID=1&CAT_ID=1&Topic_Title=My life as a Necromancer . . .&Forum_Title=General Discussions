        <hr noshade size="1">
        
        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">My first class when I started playing this game was a Paladin and for 40 lvls I enjoyed exploring the world of Norrath. My server was Tunare and not only did I enjoy each lvl but also the idea that I would be taking on bigger things. Dragons, dungeons, planes, all were experiences that I looked forward too. Then Morell-Thule came online and I decided to start out anew (this choice was prompted more by my obtaining an account of my own and thus I was now free to play it at my own accord, rather than sharing it with my father. I do hope that is not an offense in Verant's rulebook.) And so I came to Morell-Thule on the first night it openned. For some reason or another the necromancer class was my choice for my new character. Now I have no idea why I made this choice, it wasn't because of the solo ability nor was it for the farming aspect as such concepts were still hazy and not a part of the game for me. My race was a gnome simply because the concept of a tiny individual capable of bringing down giants appealed to me. The first night on Morell Thule consisted of mailing letters to and from kelethin and Felwithe.  Upon reaching lvl 8 I soloed the favorite dragon ruin in steamfont. It was at this time that I actually fell in love with the necromancer class. For the raw power that a necromancer represents, for the ability to rely on yourself. But these were not the only reasons for such affection to the class. I didn't only solo throughout these early lvls. I grouped as well and found that I was just as powerful in a group as I was by myself and this discovery was simply wonderful. From then on I played my class continously and I liked it. Every single level was fun. Maybe the people on Morell are more agreeable, (Not to say the population on the other fine servers are not =D) but I did not have a difficult time finding individuals to group with nor did I have a problem finding guilds. Perhaps these guilds placed more value in character than class or perhaps they felt necromancers brought an asset to the mix. My progress continued for 50 levels. I visited Kunark, camped trolls, grouped in Guk, and my playing style evolved to a more group oriented tone. I offered to heal, to mez, to root/park, all sorts of ways to aide my group. For the most part these methods worked well and my group members felt that a necro did indeed bring power to the table. Then the post 50 levels came. It was at this time that the game began to turn and by the majority of the posts here most concur that the post 50 levels signify a turning point in the life of a necro. The change was not instant, granted, but rather gradual. The change really creeped up on you. 51 was a nice level due to splurt and how easy it was to obtain. 52 was a little disappointing due to lack of decent spell choice. 53 was somewhat redeeming, I liked the pet since it offered decent damage in a group. 54 was also somewhat good for Deflux. All the while however that spark of power I had felt back all those levels at 8, soon dwindled to an ember. I did not feel powerful per se in a group as I had in my Guk days and pre 50s. I still felt powerful, of course, I could still solo, I could still pull off some great exp with my friend mage in Guk, but that sense of belonging began to fade. GRoups began centering on specialized classes. Warriors, Clerics, Enchanters, Wizards/druids, these were the classes of groups. the friendships and guild connections I had fostered however provided grouping chances and that was all fine and well but no more was I invited to groups. At lvl 55 it really hit me. I felt absolutely worthless. The posts declaring us mana batteries, Verant's rather lethargic responses to claims that necros roles in groups have been completely undermined. All this built up at lvl 55, no real decent spells, the disappointment after a seemingly endless hell lvl of 54, it simply didn't add up. At this point I did what most necros started doing, making twinks of other classes. More or less as an attempt to create a character that retained it's fun after 50. Twink after Twink and still Igravitated back to my necromancer. Somehow I made it 56 and then things got better. Ironically it was for a rather odd reason, the retirement of so many necros. I don't know why but the retirement of so many necros made me feel that my character was unique. This is not to say that I want necromancers to retire, on the contrary I wish they'd stick it out, for we really are a unique class. So now at 56 I wanted to push the class to it's limit. I made my own Seb groups, I made groups of necros, mages, Shadow Knights, shamans. We soloed the Seb entrance ventured deeper, coped with adds with ST and you know what . . . It was a lot of fun and that fun was something that I had lost somewhere between 51 and 55. The funny thing is my guildmates also began to welcome my addition to a group. Shamans in particular greatly enjoyed the company of a necro and for this I really began to love the class again. Furthermore, any gripes I may have of the class were vented through jokes and what not. Call me nieve, but I truely feel that the class will recieve it's upgrade. Presently we are a shadow of our former self, but that's not to say all we do is pump mana and summon corpses. There is a lot of other advantages to a necro in a group. Aux healing, back up Mez, even that hated mana pump is useful in groups. Currently I'm lvl 57 and I honestly enjoy the class once more. I group, I partner with others for the Seb entrance, I raid, I mana pump, I gripe about it, but I don't let it take up the majority of the time I play. I DoT on raids, I make pets on raids, and this is because I've learned the grouping tactics of a necro and my guild knows it. The potential to be a great necro is with every person who will ever play the class, it's just sometimes hard to find and understand. I'm not telling you to stop complaining to Verant, indeed I was at Morell Thule's BotB competing, and believe me I was pleased to see Try (Congrats btw =D) and Niq make their point on how limited necros have become in raids. Voice your objections, let them be heard, it has worked in the past, and it will work in the future. For now though explore your class a little more, you may surprise yourself and remember that this game is as much a social game as a tactical game. Having good friends and guildmates goes a long way in securing your spot for the next raid or exp group. Finally I have made a suggestion of my own that I believe can be backed up that I will briefly go into:</P><P>1) The issue of a Screaming Terror upgrade is a valid point. You can compare this situation to that of Verant's recent upgrade to druids and shamans. Both class has received upgrades regarding their heals in relation to clerics. The reason? I believe Absor said it himself that 2 of one secondary class should be able to fill the role of 1 primary class. In this druids and shamans received their upgrade in healing. Absor has a good point. My proposal is simply to apply this logic to enchanters. Currently 2 classes share mez abilities along with enchanters, Necromancers and Bards. Here we are in the same exact situation as druids and shamans. Necros and Bards are secondary classes of enchanters and thus by applying Absor's reasoning 2 necros, 2 bards, or a combination should be able to fill the role of 1 enchanter. Currently this is either impossible or extremely dangerous, so dangerous that deep camps in Sebilis, for example D2 or the Chef, nullify the idea all together. In the case of Shrooms, Juggs, this is impossible (those claiming to have done the above, congratulations =D). Necromancers have already received a form of a Mez, Screaming Terror, at 24 and yet they have not received an upgrade. Bards have received upgrades in the form of songs and instruments, although it is of my opinion that they are still unable to effectively perform a secondary enchanter function. The solution, according to Absor's reasoning (Note Absor's Reasoning, not Absor himself) is to upgrade necros and bards to the point that 2 necro/bards or a combination would be able to adequately fill the role of one enchanter. In addition the additional spells of an enchanter (haste,clarity) are also filled in a limited way by the bard, in this 1 necro and 1 bard should indeed be able to fill the spot of 1 enchanter. My proposal is to make that so by enhancing the necromancer's mezzing ability to the point that the above is a reality (Upgrades to Bards mezzing ability may also be considered, but for the most part necros would be the target of this proposal.) Those persons feeling that this would offset the desire for enchanters should be reminded that clerics are by far more desired in groups still for their power in healing and additionally that the enchanter has an arsenal of stun spells in case of problems where as necros do not. In this case enchanters would still be desired more, but still this provides our class more grouping chances, more help in the raid scene, and a more sense of belonging in a group. </P><P>There are of course other issues that I'd like to get into regarding our class, but I do not feel that I have the reasoning or precedents to back them up at this time =). Thank you for reading my post and I hope that you continue to play your necro to the best of your ability. Just because others say necros are dead, that necros are worthless, doesn't mean that they're completely correct. There might be some truth to their claims, such as the problems that necros have but that by far does not mean that necros are worthless. Changes should be made I'm merely trying to provide a basic argument with back up =). I'm not a Verant lover, so Potus do be gentle in your response =). And I once again praise my fellow Morell Thule necros for voicing their discontent at the status quo, I hope that your actions will invoke some sort of reaction for the better. I like my class and I hope you'll like yours as well.</P><P>Benradi Shadowbinder<BR>lvl 57 Defiler<BR>Morell-Thule</font></td>
