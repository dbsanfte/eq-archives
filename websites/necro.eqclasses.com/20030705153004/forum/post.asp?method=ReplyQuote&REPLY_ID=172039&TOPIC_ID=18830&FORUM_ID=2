[br]1. still missing DOT crit AAs!
2. where the hell are the revamped zones 60 65?
3. how big is the POP ZEM nerf?
4. and damnit where are the Undeads?
5. will these dot focus (hopefully increasing dps) drop just in elemental planes???

however, good news. temperature in hell will decrease. but its not time to talk about a freeze.
BUT,
- showing dot dmg
- introducing dot dps foci
- announcing partial revamp of zones (60+?)

hey Sony, you are on the right way.

                <td bgcolor="#ECECEC" valign="top" width="100%"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="2"><small>Posted&nbsp;-&nbsp;06/04/2003&nbsp;: 11:18:16 AM</small><hr size="2"><span class="spnMessageText"> Here's today's announcement. It's a long one.<br /><br />Upcoming for June 11th, 2003 <br />It's been a fun month for the EverQuest team. With the recent completion of Veksar and the redesigns of Veeshan's Peak and the Plane of Hate receiving such a nice reaction from the folks that have visited those zones, it's a pleasure for us to be able to work on Droga and Nurga in the same way. <br /><br />Seeing so many new faces on the Test server recently has been a great. There's no doubt that we need as many eyes on the complicated changes we make to the game as we can get. We wanted to thank those of you that have taken the time to help us out by logging into the Test server recently; you've been of great assistance to us. <br /><br />And as players of EverQuest, one of the most enjoyable things about working on the game is the opportunity to add game features that we've always wanted to see. Many of them are listed below. We think you'll like them as much as we do. <br /><br />1) Droga and Nurga revamp coming to Legends. The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by crafty Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and slaving away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign for these zones will be on the Legends server, Stormhammer, with our next update. The mines of Nurga will be a fun zone for characters of levels about 40 to 50. The Temple of Droga will accommodate characters around 50th to 60th level. Both zones will have some new events and quest, while retaining the distinct feel of zones. <br /><br />2) Veksar moving to all Live servers. Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there have been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of those rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the insular Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is about a city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was called Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate. <br /><br />3) Group experience bonus increasing dramatically. We've been testing this on the Test server for a few weeks, and some final tuning may be needed before it is released. The goal is to dramatically improve the experience gained by groups. The old group experience bonus ranged from 2% to 20% for a 6 person group. The new bonus will range from 20% to 80%. In addition, the 6th person added to a group will not count when experience is divided. This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 then distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the total experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member. Due to this large increase in group experience, we will be reducing the experience modifier given in Planes of Power zones. Those zones had a dramatic experience bonus. These zone-specific experience changes are more than offset by the increased group bonus. <br /><br />4) Experience range increase for characters above 60th level. This is another change that we are testing and anticipate moving to the Live servers. It will open up many of the "old world" zones to players previously restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be "blue" to a level 65 character has increased as far as level 50, with the "light blue" range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, however, are still going to be for fighting things around and above your level. This will open up areas for high level characters in groups and solo. <br /><br />5) Shared bank vault will be added. There are times when a player wants to trade items from one character to another. In the past making such a trade may have included dropping items on the ground or asking a friend to hold them for you. To make such trades more convenient, we are adding two shared bank slots to the interface. Any character on the same account and server can access these extra bank slots. No-Drop items can't be placed in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in the shared bank at any time. <br /><br />6) Planes of Power access changes will be implemented. Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play with their friends and guild mates. <br /><br />To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement: <br /><br />Level 55 and over <br />Plane of Storms <br />Plane of Torment <br />Plane of Valor <br />Crypt of Decay <br /><br />Level 62 and over <br />Bastion of Thunder <br />Halls of Honor <br /><br />Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as they always have. <br /><br />This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes. We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is. <br /><br />7) Enhanced Spell Descriptions added. Spell casters spend hours studying their trade. It takes great mental effort to understand and master the complicated arcana needed to cast even the simplest of spells. We have added new information to the spell descriptions displayed in game. An additional line of text explains what the spell does in general and includes information such as damage and duration when appropriate. <br /><br />8) A new method for memorizing spells. There was a day when casters only needed 32 pages in their spell books, with only 5 spells per page. These days spell books have 50 pages and 8 spells per page. Frankly, that's a lot of spells. We've come up with a new method for finding and memorizing spells that will make things easier for the overburdened spell caster. Right-clicking an empty spell gem will open a list of spell categories. Pointing your mouse at a category will display a list of spells. Selecting a spell from that list will make your character sit down, memorize the spell and stand back up. <br /><br />We know that many people are happy with the existing spellbook system. Rest assured that the spellbook isn't going anywhere. This new memorization system is an optional convenience for those who wish to try out a new method of managing their spells. The spellbook remains the only way to scribe new spells. <br /><br />9) Spell Favorites. Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up the spell favorites menu. You will be able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved spell sets. As with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells more convenient. <br /><br />10) Damage Over Time spell messages. Damage over Time (DoT) spells cause a certain amount of damage to the target at intervals. Currently, the caster of the spell is only told about the damage done the first time the spell does damage. All the other intervals were a mystery. What certainly sounds like an easy feature to add required a bit of work, but after the next update DoT spells will report their damage to the caster each time damage is done. <br /><br />If the new messages get to be too much for you, you can disable them in the Options window, much like any other type of damage reporting. <br /><br />11) Improvements to the game for new players. New players can be overwhelmed by all of the items they find in the game (heck, so do those of us who have been playing for a few years). To help reduce that confusion, we are adding a Tradeskill tag to items that are used as components in trade skill recipes. To help guide new characters, Guildmasters will take a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to some starting points for quests. There will be even more quests in the newbie zones, most of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the grandest cities. In addition, NPC merchants as well as other notable folks will have a title that will explain what their jobs are. For example, a baking supply merchant can be recognized as such by the description beneath his name. <br /><br />Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week. <br /><br />EQUI_Optionswnd.xml <br />EQUIhelpwnd.xml <br />Bankwnd.xml <br />BigBankwnd.xml <br />Help.html <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Future Plans<br />Further Down the Line Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game. Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are. Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time. <br /><br />1) Partial Zone Revamps <br /><br />These consist of improvements in the experience gain, monster density and/or item rewards in some of the older zones. The goal is to improve the playability and reward for adventuring in these zones without completely remaking the contents of the zone. We plan to do several of these, and we'll keep you updated as we move through these. We recently finished Veeshan's Peak, the Temple of Droga and the mines of Nurga. Currently we are working on a partial revamps of The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Sirens Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, Cazic-Thule, and Velketor's Labyrinth. <br /><br />2) Updated Character Creation Descriptions <br /><br />EverQuest has evolved and improved a lot over the last four plus years. With four years of updates and enhancements, sometimes your information gets outdated. One of the things we will be doing soon is updating the character creation information both in game and on the web site. <br /><br />3) Damage Over Time Spell Foci <br /><br />We are working on implementing focus items for Damage over Time (DoT) spells. Focus items improve aspects of certain spells when they are cast. Originally, DoT spells were included in a group of other spells that some focus items affected. But the nature of DoT spells is very different than other spells, and the affect of these focus items on DoT spells was not what we wanted it to be. A new class of focus items needs to be created to increase the effect of DoT spells. <br /><br />4) Items in the Planes of Power <br /><br />We will be looking at the quality of Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate. Items for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed: <br /><br />Crypt of Decay <br />Plane of Torment <br />Halls of Honor <br />Plane of Tactics <br />Plane of Innovation <br />Bastion of Thunder <br /><br />5) Class Balance <br /><br />We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time. Some options being considered are:<br /><br />Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br /><br />Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate. The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall. <br /><br />6) Shields and blocking <br /><br />We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <br /><br />7) Tradeskills <br /><br />We will be looking at the chance of failure for tradeskill recipes. We are aware of the concerns of trades folk in EverQuest, and it is on our schedule to review things such as the fact that masters of trade skills can fail the easiest recipes. That doesn't necessarily mean that we plan to change it, but we will most certainly look it over - and probably will change it . <br /></span></font></td>

Kania obviously has no clue how to play a necromancer.  If she can't see the value of Hitpoints, Arch Ability AA's, not to mention the FT comment, it's obviously a cleric who has a 65 Necro they bought on Ebay.  Yes, that is an attack on your credibility and knowledge of this class.  If you seriously can't tell the difference between 4.5k and 6.5k, you are a lost cause, end of story.  I push my DPS to the max, and with Aggro of Thule, FP, and NT, i often get summoned.  I also rarely die, due to the fact that i have 6500 buffed hitpoints, Channeling 3, LR5, and most of Combat stability.  Defensive AA's are a HUGE bonus.  Offensive aa's, all 30 aa's of crits, THeft of life, SCM, you are a fool if you think your toon is riding high at 50 AA.  <br /><br />You said "that is why the ubers don't post here" implying you are one of them.  That's enough for me to see you think you are elite.  No matter what you say, your tone, attitude and comments have been rude and inappropriate.  If you want to treat lower level players like crap go to the druid board.  It would be really nice to see about 500 of them get frustrated and quit because of some loud mouth know-it-all.  For the lower level players she insulted, i'm sorry.  THe general idea is to encourage players to have fun, and accomplish all they can.  I had some great teachers over the past 3 years and have had a fun time putting my toon into good status.  Don't let one discouraging person with some serious insecurity issues make the game suck for you, it isn't the intent of this board at all.  End of rant, please come back after you've gotten a new attitude if you really want to contribute to the board.</span></font></td>

I think the basic idea is NOT to get hit. I am very skilled at that.&gt;&gt;<br /><br />Not only is it 2k but it is always defensive AA abilities, again something you do not appear to have.  And I do not care how carefull you are, if your pushing your class to the limits you are going to run the risk of aggro from time to time.  Not to mention events that deal with multiple spawns at once (RZ encounter, Time Trials) or unavoidable AEs.  The more HPs you have the greater a buffer you have to survive when something goes wrong.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;As for AA's, do tell, what AA's are so class defining over 50 that you spend that will make one necro stand out from others?&gt;&gt;<br /><br />Did I say "class defining"?  No, I even mentioned that we could use some good Necromancer class AAs.  Just looking over your AAs I can make a few suggestions.  ND III (for you it would come out to about 250ish HPs), Planar Power/Innate Enlightnment is nice to increase your Int and Stam limits (making it possible for more HPs and Mana), FoM is a nice bonus to DD, CA and LR are handy to help you survive long enough to FD if you draw aggro (add in Channeling Focus for reduced interuptions).  There are several good AAs out there, sure they may not be stelar but they are usefull.  Even Lifeburn, which so many seem to be down upon, has a use.  Lifeburn is handy for those timed encounters (like Coirnav in PoW), for me it is basically a 6.5k DD (plus the DoT) that costs me nothing to cast.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;As for tossing Neuro's out, esp on long drawn out fights you might be able to stack a full set of DoTs, I just find that inefficient.&gt;&gt;<br /><br />Depends upon your equipment and AAs really (not to mention the current mob you are facing).  With a decent ID foci, elemental gloves, SCM III, SCF III and FoM III Neuro is a pretty hard to pass up.  Neuro being alter based is just an added bonus.  You have to remember that efficient damage is not always that important and sometimes fast damage is vastily more important.<br /><br />Plus with our mana regen rate (espically fully buffed and with mana regen items) you should not have too much of an issue keeping up your DoTs and throwing in some added DD.  The AA subtely skill can also help you avoid additional aggro from using DD.<br /><br />Oh do not worry about the robe.  There are a couple items in Time that have a similar, yet better effect upon them.  Time is another place were being able to do fast damage is a bit more important then efficent damage.  So far everything is a timed event and if you take to long, well...<br /><br /></span></font></td>

While I do agree we could use some better class AAs but there is no way in hell that you with 50 AAs would be as valuable nor as effective as a Necromancer with say 200.  As for you comment about equipment, you have to be joking.  Equipment has a very big impact upon Necromancers, espically raiding Necromancers.  Heck there is a pretty large gap between your equipment and my own and I am still working to improve mine.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;At 2k hp you can get close to 4.5k HP raid buffed. You need more?&gt;&gt;<br /><br />Did you seriously just ask that question?  Hell I believe I break 4.5 self buffed.  In tier III zones, the yard trash leading to the gods can destroy me in seconds with 6.5k raid buffed.  With 4.5k you would not even see the "loading, please wait message".  Not to mention you should already be pretty well aware of the various high damage AE attacks in PoP.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;How is FT15 going to improve that so significantly, especially for a DoT caster who usually has some downtime waiting for DoTs to wear off?&gt;&gt;<br /><br />Why the fuck are you waiting for your DoTs to wear off, do you not have Neurotoxin?  Honestly, what are you doing?  You should be maximizing your damage, not sitting upon your backside.<br /><br /></span></font></td>

That bit of balancing did make us balanced with regards to the other casters in the sense that we could stack necros like wizzies could be stacked. However, the point is: we are still slightly sub-par in certain respects, especially in the mana/damage ratio department. Sure, they had to take into account our mana regen when deciding the mana costs of our spells, but I don't think it really makes sense that a spell that takes longer to do less damage should cost more mana.<br /><br />Focus items really didn't make that much of an impact on the game when they were released, especially for necros. I stand by my opinion that the only focus effect that really did anything for necros balancewise was affliction efficiency. There were no corresponding effects to the DD-improving foci, extended affliction was an almost laughable attempt. I seriously can't believe that they thought that all those foci would affect dots in any meaningful way. In any case, focus effects really only came into the limelight after PoP was released and they flooded the game with focus items. Prior to that, most useful high end focus items were not particularly accessible to the majority of casters on any server. How was that supposed to help make casters more balanced?<br /><br />As for resist changes, as far as I'm aware, there were 2 changes. The first was that pets would use the resists of their owner if it was higher than their natural resists. This was good, if marginally useful. Unfortunately, they then decided to revamp the entire resist scale. Our spells which originally landed on mobs without any problems (Splurt anyone?) suddenly became resisted perhaps 1 in 6 times. Our own resists, on the other hand, became all-or-nothing affairs: if you couldn't get your resists to 300, there was no point in trying to up your resists anyway because even piddly little HoT-type AEs would land on you. That pretty much took care of whatever resist advantages our pets got.<br /><br />Critical nukes were added only to wizards. All other classes had to buy them in the form of AA. Therefore, it was not balancing in and of itself. First of all, it required that a player bought an expansion before they could get the skill. Then the other classes all had to dump valuable experience into buying the skill; balance should be class inherent. Next, given that our crit nukes barely equal uncritted wizzie/mage nukes, how exactly did that help us be more balanced? Finally, our main 'damage theme' is damage-over-time spells. The idea of crit nukes is at odds with with our main theme and therefore doesn't make us more balanced but instead more conflicted. So instead of focusing on our dotting abilities, we end up getting a mish mash of dots and nukes (but nukes that must do less damage than wizzie or mage nukes).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm fairly happy with the state necros are in. Further improvements would just be nice touches to further round us up and to make things make more sense (nukes doing more instant damage while costing less mana is something that gets me pretty annoyed). But I remain unconvinced that caster balancing was even halfway complete. I won't, however, argue that the pure melee classes are in need of more immediate patching up.</span></font></td>

Ones that are noticably an improvement?  List them out.  This of course would be part of a great deal of necro's big arguments.  Class defining AA's are the suck or non-existant.<br /><br />At what level do you sit and let people who are lower than you and have not experienced what you have bash you for somthing they have not experienced?  I never attacked anyone or anyones level who did not attack me first.  As for calling myself uber, I did not do that either.  I was labeled by others that before I ever used that word.  <br /><br />And exactly what gear would make a noticeable difference for a raiding necro so greatly?  HP? Mana? FT?  At 2k hp you can get close to 4.5k HP raid buffed.  You need more?  If you have 2k HP chances are you have 280int in gear(not hard to accomplish) which would give you close to 4.5k mana.  That's quite abit, how much more would mana items improve this over what you have?  FT?  Raid buffed mana regen w/o FT is close to 90-100 mana tick standing.  How is FT15 going to improve that so significantly, especially for a DoT caster who usually has some downtime waiting for DoTs to wear off?   These reasons are the reasons I say necros have a greater flexability in gear than other classes.  I should never be getting hit thanks to DP agro reduction, my mana generally runs 80% in battles thanks in part to 280 int and raid mana regen.  The only exception to gear I would say would make any great improvement would be that of resist gear, but I am just a resist gear freak.<br /><br />What part do you not agree with with my theorizing?</span></font></td>

Your rolling for other perks.  Plate/tanking + average DPS.  If you want DPS and you want to go Melee you go Rogue, Ranger, Monk.  Its like rolling a cleric and saying "we need more DPS in groups/raids." nonsense.  You knew what you were getting into when you rolled your toon.  If not you knew by about lvl 20 or 25.  <br /><br />Rogues are fine IMHO.  Whenever I group with rogues i see great DPS from them.  Rangers with bow AA's are absolutely amazing.  I wish I had that kind of DPS.  Unless I'm chaining Neuro + ToM, theres no way I'm gonna touch half of those guys on exp mobs even with FP+SK+BoT.  Bow Crits for 800+ every fourth or fifth hit, normal hits for 400-600 range.  What more do they honestly need?  AA should give melee more dps, but theres no "huge lacking" for the melee out there.<br /><br />Melee are not bound by their spells and game design. Of all the classes bound horribly by spells Necros are at the top of the list.  No crits for DoTS, lots of damage for ~same or more mana as a high damage nuke.  With no crits!  Hell even a mage casting their bolt and a rain every fight + pet will keep dps with a necro easy.  Add Crit AA's to them and you see some sweet 4200 hits.  Which is cool, grats for mages, but thats 2 of my dots, which take ~ a min to finish that kind of damage.  Which was just done instantly, every other pull or third pull with all crit aa's.<br /><br />So there is a point here about how necros are really lacking.  Don't get me wrong for solo our DoT's are fine.  I think thats the main problem as to why SoE hasn't really fixed it.  If they up our DoT's to be on par with Nukes (which is needed for grouping/raiding), they'll turn us into demi-gods even further for solo. But they really shouldnt worry about solo too much considering what most of us solo for AA is already fairly trivial.  <br /><br />If anyone here thinks a 2500dmg dot in a min is any good, they've obviously never grouped with a max crit wiz or mage.  Sure we are consistant every pull, but so what?  With the type of group mana regen buffs out there now, not even counting mounts, most of those classes have hardly any mana problems unless they are chaining.<br /><br />Either way we do need upgrades, melee's really don't.  Other then a little tweaking here or there, they are fine with the right AA's/Weapons.</span></font></td>

You qualified yourself in my mind by saying you had been raiding end game for 3 years, end of story.  Someone who calls themselves uber, at least in my mind, better spend everyday striving to make their toon the best.  Best to look at those ahead of you, to see what they are doing to make themselves better.  Imitate those ahead of you, not mock those who are behind you.  In the course of your posts, i began to think you were more of an dilusional elitist than an uber.  You could easily resolve that in my mind by showing some respect to those above and below you, but as i don't see you admitting that ripping on 58 necro's isn't cool if they say somethin first, i'm gonna have to leave you at that category in my mind.<br /><br />A necro with 50 AA is not as effective as one with 300+.  That is the first non-logical irrational statement i have heard you say.  Just in Arch skills alone i have over 76 AA and i feel that all 76 are huge improvements to my character.  Add in lifeburn, PLanarpower, LR/ID, FoM, there is a lot of AA you are lacking that leaves me suspicious at what level you do play this game.<br /><br />The statement about necro's don't need gear, well, i kinda think you might be some class besides a necro.  Necro's do need gear.  We gain Immensely from FT/Regen/Mana items.  There may be a "certain point" but it sure isn't 2900, i'd say more like 3800 or more.  I listened to people tell me that "necro's don't need gear as bad as other classes" BS for far too long, it just isn't true.  Ask one of the 4k+ HP, 5500 mana pool, FT 18 necro's if they would ever go back to raiding with 2900/4400/0FT.  Then again, it all depends at what level you are raiding at.  Just don't rip on the casual players, when by my standpoint, you are not very far separated from them.<br /></span></font></td>

A necro with 50aa is about as effective as a necro with 300+ aa.  Most of our AA's are just pure fluff crap, atleast IMO.<br /><br />After realizing this, I only play 3 days a week to raid because of it.  Until they place some reasonable AAs for necro's in the game, I really see no reason to play them.  In the meantime  I use my 58 cleric and am PLing up a monk, bard, ranger, shaman, cleric (2), ench, and rogue.  I have soloed TONS, and needed a break.  Now with 8 chars 50+  I have my choice in what I want to do until such time necros actually get a decent going over.<br /><br />And as for being full of myself, if the first remarks were not made to me, then I never would have never said anything that might give anyone such an impression.  Being full of one's self and qualifing ones self are two different things.  As for my HP/mana, etc.  Being a necro I have a GREAT luxury that many other classes don't.   My ability to perform is not as greatly influenced by my equipment, so I sit out for great periods of time letting my guildies who need equipment more take it.  Having low HP, etc has not affected my ability to play the game.  Anything above a certain point is just gravy.  Would you not agree?<br /></span></font></td>

Less about what she started out to say ... Necromancers have not received much in the way of class balancing.  AA/Focus items were intended to balance the dps of casters w/melee, and improve preist classes.  The majority of items were based around wizards (DD crits/Focus items) and Clerics (improved healing, healing adept etc).  Now all classes with nukes have the ability of benefitting from wizard adjustment, all healing classes can benefit from clerics.  Necromancers are neither.  They gave us a 25% dot efficiency and an Aff Extension.  Did we gain as much as wizards/mage/druids ... when comparing AA (possible) and item gain, the other casting classes have pushed ahead.  As Kania said, caster balancing 1.0 was not a complete success for us, though wizards loved it.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, FINALLY fixing dot stacking was nice.  Being able to solo for AA, that's nice too.  But what super useful AA can i want to get?  Melee are falling behind tho, something needs to be done to keep the game fun for them.<br /><br />I also want to point out, i went back and read all of Kania's posts and i'm sorry, as much as i agree with what you had to say initially, you are kinda full of yourself for a lvl 65 necro, 50 aa and 2866 HP's.  You may be associated with an "uber" guild, but playing 3 days a week for raids, and having only 50 AA, you need to hold back on puffing yourself up.  You only have 1 high Tradeskill (blacksmithing) so my question is ... what have you done in your 300+ days played that qualifies you as an "uber"?  Do you realize that the truly uber necro's have 300 aa and 2k more HP's than you?  I don't go for the "uber by association" idea either, if you are in an uber guild you are piggy backing in the worst way.<br /><br />To bag on the level 58 and 61 necro's who happened to find everquest later than you is not only lame but funny to me.  I'm sure that if they had a tutor they could pass you in a month with your 3 day a week playing style.  Granted it was annoying how they mixed up quotes and put words in your mouth.  I don't like the "attack every uber who posts here mentality" either, but the fact is, it was a discussion till you started with the "thank you drive through and your dismissed."  Then it turned into a feeding frenzy on every detail of your life. You treat people like yard trash/plebians, expect to be hated like an aristocrat.  <br /><br />I don't have my magelo attached to my sig, but just in case you want it, 37962.  I'm not uber, but wise enough to know where i stand on the totem pole.  Enough with this i'm gonna go play some more<br /><br />Leriche</span></font></td>

People can argue that now soloers have more options since they can go back to old world zones, to which I say BS.  I've hunted tremendously in old world zones even after PoP came out, and the exp there, off of dark blues, simply blows chunks, end of story.<br /><br />Unless the borderline level 50 mobs are going to give as good exp as the level 58 dark blues I've been hunting in old world zones (while retaining their 4k hps), there is not going to be a single reason to go back to the old world zones.  <br /></span></font></td>

There is no AE mezz that works on 55+ mobs besides the 6 sec CRAP WoM.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />I said "AE mezzing restored to the way it worked in the old days."  I didn't say "AE mezzing better than it was in the old days."  Anyway, AE mezzing is largely irrelevant in PoP because of the massive upgrades to the lull series.  The combination of the two changes has greatly decreased the need for FD pulling by monks and SKs at all levels of the game.  In fact, I've seen an increasing recognition that monks and SKs are inefficient pullers because an FD pull takes longer than just casting lull and pulling with an arrow.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">Lulls got nerfed BIG time if you don't remember, from 8 min duration to 40 sec duration.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Is that a serious comment?  Before the changes to the lull series (which included the decreased duration), lull didn't even work.  The lull series was considered to be a bunch of suicide spells for clerics and enchanters.  Now they are a highly effective indoor/outdoor version of harmony.  At the high end, Pacification allows some pretty spectacular pulls.  Who needs an 8 minute duration on lull anyway?<br /><br />Skalantra -- You are absolutely correct, but the reduction of the PoP bonus and the increased group bonus may level things out.  That may or may not be a good thing.</span></font></td>

I have been talking about that a lot.  Raising the con of a mob will do NADA to where a level 63+ can exp.  At 65 you need to kill 60+ mobs or you won't get much exp.  No non PoP zone has 60+ exp mobs.  So I am still stuck in PoP for exp.  I hope that SoE realizes that and either ups the non PoP zone zems and/or gets rid of the 5 level con problem.</span></font></td>
