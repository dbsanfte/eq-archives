            <br>
                      Mordann’s first memory of the event was the death of Olath. His parents brought Olath home as a puppy                      soon before Mordann was born, and for these past seven years, Mordann and Olath were inseparable. For                      Mordann, Olath was dearer to him than his older brother, Lothund. He did not understand death as he<br>
                      stood over the black dog’s corpse. His father buried the dark dog, and told him they could get another.&nbsp;
            Little consolation to Mordann, as he cried over the dog’s grave.<br>
            <br>
                      Moonlight barely revealed the roots and snags of the path as Mordann raced after Lothund. The forest                      blurred past him as he strained to keep up with the older boys. Lothund and his friends were going into                      Neriak tonight, and Mordann wanted to join them.<br>
            <br>
                      Lothund glanced back at his younger brother. He was tired of the little pest following him around. Ever                      since his stupid pet died, Mordann has been following him like a dog himself. For the first few months, he                      liked the way Mordann would do anything he wanted him to. At a quick command, Mordann would finish<br>
                      Lothund’s chores. At merely a suggestion, Mordann would sneak into the kitchen and steal some of mom’s                      muffins. Lothund taunted Mordann all the while, dreaming up more dangerous tasks for him to do. But the                      constant attention grated on Lothund’s nerves, and he resolved to stop it once and for all.<br>
            <br>
                      The group of older boys burst through the underbrush and into a clearing, a tall keep looming before them                      in the moonlight. They stopped, hushed, gazing at the house and the ebony tower jutting from the center.                      Dark windows covered with rusty iron grates broke the severe stone surface in several spots.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      Mordann burst through moments later, gasping, sweat glistening on his dark brow. He stopped next to the                      boys, hands on his knees breathing heavily. Looking up, he spied the keep. His jaw dropped open.<br>
            <br>
                      Lothund smiled at his friends, then kneeled and put a friendly arm around his brother’s small shoulders.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      “There is the house, Mordann,” Lothund said quietly. “There, dos must enter and retrieve the velve used                      by the Jabbre. Bring it
            here, then udos may continue to Neriak.”<br>
            <br>
                      Mordann straightened and shivered slightly, still gazing at the imposing structure. “Is that nau the house                      of . . . “?<br>
            <br>
                      Lothund forcibly turned Mordann to face him. “The necromancer? Xas. Are dos scared?” He glared into                      Mordann’s eyes. “Usstan thought dos wished to join udos in Neriak, but usstan was wrong. Run back                      home, Mordann, dos wasted udos time.”<br>
            <br>
                      “No,” Mordann said quickly. “Usstan wants to go! Really! But why must usstan retrieve the velve?”<br>
            <br>
                      “Dos question me?” He gripped Mordann’s shoulder painfully. “Udos jall already went in, moons ago. Do it,                      or run home. Usstan does nau wish to be late arguing with dos.”<br>
            <br>
                      Mordann turned and looked at the dark structure, and took a hesitant step forward. He turned back once.                      “Will dos wait for ussa here?”<br>
            <br>
                      Lothund smiled. “Xas, Dalninuk. But hurry.”<br>
            <br>
                      Mordann ran towards the keep. When he disappeared over a rise, Lothund turned to his friends. “Let’s go.                      Udos can make Neriak in half an hour.”<br>
            <br>
                      One of his friends spoke. “What of dos dalninuk, Loth?”<br>
            <br>
                      Lothund stopped. “What about him? He’ll get scared and run as a wael back home. Usstan does naut wish                      to miss seeing jabbress Kalinala dance. Dos may stay if dos wishes.”<br>
            <br>
                      The boys all agreed, and ran towards Neriak.<br>
            <br>
                      Mordann found the lower back entrance exactly where his brother told him it would be. The rusted iron                      gate bent at an angle leaving an opening just wide enough for Mordann’s thin frame to wriggle through.<br>
            <br>
                      A low wind moaned through the tunnel as Mordann crept forward. A noxious smell wafted with the wind,                      bringing with it warnings to flee. The tunnel wound it’s way through the darkness, meandering in an                      aimless fashion, always sloped downwards. Ever as he crept, the odor grew stronger.<br>
            <br>
                      After some time, the tunnel opened into a small, rough-hewn area. The far wall was made of large cut                      basalt blocks, probably the foundation of the tower. A thick, ironbound door was firmly set in the wall.&nbsp;
            Mordann’s soft booted feet stirred dust with each step as he walked through the thick silence. The                      thudding of his heart was the only sound he heard. His thoughts were mixed as he placed a slim hand on                      the cool iron latch.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      What if it won’t open? Will he be allowed to accompany Lothund to Neriak? What if it opens? What lies                      behind this stout door? Further thoughts crowded in, of the back gate, of the Necromancer, but all were                      overridden by his brother’s voice, “Hurry.”<br>
            <br>
                      He swallowed, wetting his dusty throat, and listened at the door. A humming sound, very faint, resonated                      from beyond. No other sound. He pushed the latch down, but it wouldn’t move. He held his breath and                      applied his weight to the latch, but it still would not release. Relief flooded through him as he sank to his                      knees holding the latch. The door wouldn’t open. His brother would understand, and they would all go to                      Neriak, and he wouldn’t be alone, and—<br>
            <br>
                      --the rusty latch snapped, the door swung out. Mordann gasped, his heart nearly burst. A rank, wet odor                      forced its way past the door and down the tunnel. The foul wind created a moaning sound hollowly calling                      out to him, telling him to run. But he remained, gasping for breath, leaning against the frame of the door,                      staring at the darkness within.<br>
            <br>
                      The humming sound was louder, and echoed throughout a large chamber. The walls glistened with some                      type of glowing aura, green and sickly. A warm, moist breeze brushed past his face, carrying noxious                      fumes. Mordann staggered to his feet, leaning upon the doorframe. He wasn’t sure how long he stood,                      staring within. But he heard his brother’s voice, “Hurry.”<br>
            <br>
                      His mind was a welter of confusion as he took his first step past the doorway. The room was huge,                      constructed of the same basalt stones, in a circular pattern. The humming vibrated in his ears. His gaping                      mouth filled with the taste of the noxious fumes, now nearly overwhelming. He closed his mouth, his                      tongue feeling thick and oily.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      The room had no floor, merely a landing, with steps rising to the left, and falling to the right. There was no                      ceiling, the walls towered into the darkness above.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      He paused, staring into the darkness below. Sweat trickled down his ankle in his boot. Strangely, his eyes                      could not pierce the darkness. The humming emanated from there. His mind was working too fast, a blur of                      images. The gate, his brother and his friends running through the forest, the area by the door. Why this<br>
                      dangerous task. The task seemed pointless. But if his brother
            already snuck in here, certainly it wasn’t too                      dangerous. Was this a test? What if he failed? Where would he go? What if he
            succeeded?<br>
            <br>
                      With sudden inspiration, Mordann pieced together what his mind had been telling him. His brother’s larger                      and more muscular body could not have fit through the gate. And the dust outside the door had been                      undisturbed for years, not moons.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      Mordann was the first living soul in years to pass through that entrance. His brother lied to him. But why?&nbsp;
            For no reason, except to hurt him. Anger and bitterness welled within him, pushing his fear and terror into                      abeyance. Betrayal. Mordann fought down the tears as he realized how he had been deceived. How he                      hated his brother, then. Malice seethed within him, setting him aflame with the desire to hurt Lothund. He                      pictured his small fists pummeling his brother’s face until blood flowed and Lothund cried out with the                      agony he felt within his own heart. He must do something, anything, to show the disdain he felt for                      Lothund.<br>
            <br>
                      And Mordann knew how to make Lothund feel as small as he felt now. Mordann would continue forward,                      and find something to take back with him. He will show it to his brother, and mock him. He would show                      Lothund’s friends how Mordann himself dared to journey into a place where his older brother feared. He                      would find the source of the humming sound, some
            great and powerful magical device, and bring it out.&nbsp;
            <p style="MARGIN: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px" align="left"><br>
                      Firmly resolved to humiliate his brother, and forgetting his recent terror, he boldly placed his foot upon the                      step leading down and slipped down the stairs. He cried out as his arms flailed. Nails scraping across the                      damp walls, he managed to barely catch his balance after tumbling down several steps. He stood with his                      sweaty back pressed against the greasy cool stones. He laughed.
            A fine way to start.<br>
            <br>
                      His laugh cut off abruptly as the humming grew louder. The
            terror, which had faded into the background,                      now gripped him again. He glanced down into the darkness and saw it move. The blanket of darkness                      undulated, and the humming grew to a droning. Icy fear thrilled down his spine as all thoughts of his                      brother fled. The darkness was rising to meet him, a great cloud
            of black, droning, and with it came                      overpowering reek of death. He scramble back up the stairs and his feet slid from under him. He thudded                      to the steps, breath whooshing out. He glanced back, eyes wide with terror. The darkness rose to meet                      him, a rolling cloud of blackness. He got to his feet as he was engulfed by the dark, a swarm of flies and                      gnats, crawling over his sweat-soaked body, biting and stinging. He opened his mouth to scream, and                      breathed in crawling things. Flailing his arms, eyes closed, his
            feet moved unsure of a direction, and he                      stepped off the stairs into nothing.<br>
            <br>
                      The weightlessness of the fall lasted forever, his arms and legs pirouetting. He landed on his back with a                      wet thud, the world spinning, the stench overpowering. His leg landed on something sharp, and it cut                      deeply into his calf. He lay stunned on a spongy bed as the dark cloud droned above him, his gorge rising.&nbsp;
            He lifted his leg off the thing piercing it. It felt deep, and his calf
            burned.<br>
            <br>
                      There was no air; he couldn’t breathe the noxious fumes. He sat up, feeling sharp things poking him all                      over his body. He was covered in slime. His stomach heaved, revolting against the horrid stench. His eyes                      slowly came into focus; he saw objects, blurred and shapeless. He concentrated on something close and                      round. His vision cleared, and he saw a green, moldy skull, hollow eyes staring intently as it grinned evilly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      Slowly, he looked around, seeing the corpses, all in various stages of decomposition and decay. A skeletal                      arm stretched from the morass of bodies in a vain attempt to call attention. Near his feet lay a bloated                      human, back arched in a rictus of pain, mouth open silently yelling at him. Dimly, he stared at the naked
            body, and saw the jaw begin working up and down, as if the swollen corpse was trying to utter a secret.<br>
            <br>
                      A rat emerged from the bloated man’s mouth and ran up Mordann’s leg, then disappeared through the                      ribcage of a maggot-swarmed carcass.<br>
            <br>
                      Mordann screamed. Blindly, he leapt to his feet, screams echoing from the silent walls. The ground was                      spongy, yet partially solid. He frantically sludged his way towards a wall, hoping to find the stairs. His foot                      came down on the bloated human’s belly. The body undulated, then his foot burst through the belly.&nbsp;
            Mordann was showered with a warm, green vomit as the man’s decaying innards sprayed over him.&nbsp;
            Mordann slipped and landed on the man, whose body undulated up, staring at Mordann with white eyes,                      mouth agape in a bloody cavity. Mordann backed away on his hands and knees, still screaming, world                      spinning, fingers crashing through bone and squelching through rotting flesh.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      He began to sink in warm curd. He stood upright, but couldn’t pull one leg from the sludge without the                      other sinking deeper. Warm putrid ooze dripped down his face as he continued to scream, throat parched                      and mouth burning. He looked down, and saw the faces of the dead staring back.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      A powerful hand gripped him by the back of the neck, sharp bony fingers digging into his skin. He looked                      over his shoulder and saw the glowing eyes and grinning skull of a skeleton towering over him. Mordann                      tried to wriggle free of the dead thing’s grasp, but he had already sunk to his hips in the quagmire.<br>
            <br>
                      With a wet sucking sound the skeleton pulled the slight boy from the mass of decomposing bodies.&nbsp;
            Mordann struggled vainly as it carried him up the stairs.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      At the top waited a tall Tier’dal, eyes gleaming red, and his smile was death. The world began to spin, and                      Mordann’s young mind, finally stretched to the limit, snapped.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <br>
                      Dead hand grasps<br>
                      The young elf gasps<br>
                      Voices cry up from below<br>
                      Stay with us, stay with us, do not wish to go<br>
                      Stay with us, stay with us, we’ve so much to show.<br>
            <br>
                      Ear-splitting screams<br>
                      From the boy, they seem<br>
                      Unable to drown out their song<br>
                      Be with us, be with us, for you we do long<br>
                      Be with us, be with us, we’ve known all along.<br>
            <br>
                      Struggling in vain<br>
                      Feeling nothing but pain<br>
                      Confronted by immortal gaze<br>
                      Come to us, come to us, life is a haze<br>
                      Come to us, come to us, with power to amaze.<br>
            <br>
                      Dark eyes stare<br>
                      His soul is laid bare<br>
                      And fear melts to desire<br>
                      Sing with us, sing with us, lift your voice higher<br>
                      Sing with us, sing with us, be one with our choir.<br>
            <br>
                      Silence my son<br>
                      You shall be the one<br>
                      Darkness will follow your deeds.<br>
                      Join with us, join with us, we’ll make rivvels bleed<br>
                      Join with us, join with us, on hate shall we feed.<br>
            <br>
                      Joined in hate<br>
                      Sealed by His fate<br>
                      On soul’s blood we drink our fill<br>
                      One of us, one with us, rising urge to kill<br>
                      Go from us, nau leave us, blessed by His will.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
                      His eyes opened slowly. A low flame burned in the lamp by his bed, throwing a soft light across his room.&nbsp;
            He lay in his bed, mind numbed with sleep. Voices in the next room brought him from his slumber.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      His mind shocked awake. The keep and the ebony tower flooded him. A dream so real? He threw his                      rumpled sheets to the floor and examined his leg. The area on his calf was no longer smooth and black. A                      dimple of a scar now appeared on the side, long healed as if a puncture occurred several moons ago.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      “Nau, not a dream,” he thought. He rose from the bed and padded across the floor on bare feet. He                      glanced around his room. His study table of burnished pine was neat and organized, as always. The shelf                      by the clothes chest had his wooden figures of the Hero and the Paladin, locked in mortal combat. His                      father carved those for him on his last birthday. All was as he
            remembered; yet something was different.&nbsp; Something was changed.<br>
            <br>
                      He listened at the door. He recognized his father’s voice. Yet the other was strange. Deeper. Ethereal. And                      his father, always a commanding presence, seemed oddly deferential to this other voice.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      “Are dos sure that dos wishes nauthing by way of thanks,” his father said.<br>
            <br>
                      “There is naught dos has that usstan wishes,” the voice replied. “Usstan would nau have even bothered                      to save dos dalhar, except for his pitiful screeching.”<br>
            <br>
                      “But dos did save ussa’s dalharuk,” his father said nervously, “and for that usstan is eternally grateful.”<br>
            <br>
                      “Do nau wael dosself,” the voice snapped. “Usstan could nau wait for dos dalhar’s screeching to stop, and                      was merely going to end it personally. But it was the way he looked after he was dragged out, and . . . “,&nbsp;
            he trailed off.<br>
            <br>
                      “And?” his father whispered.<br>
            <br>
                      The voice paused. “He looked rapturous. And once out of the pit, he jumped back in.”<br>
            <br>
                      Mordann moved quietly away from the door and began dressing. He belted on his green pants, and pulled                      on the red tunic his mother made. Everything was so familiar, but so different. He laced his boots that his                      father just bought for him in Neriak, and he left from the back door.<br>
            <br>
                      He knew the area intimately, yet it all looked so peculiar. The things in his room, toys that he once                      cherished, meant little to him now. He ran in the starlight between the small wooden houses of their town,                      and hopped the fence at the end of the road. The clothes he wore, the things he studied, they all seemed<br>
                      distant. They were extraneous, of little consequence. He crossed the meadow, tall grass whipping his                      shins. Mental pictures of his father, stern and commanding. His mother, warm and smiling. His brother. Yes,                      Lothund. These images meant nothing to him now. It was as if his life of yesterday was a dream, and the<br>
                      keep and the ebony tower was reality.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
                      He came to the spot and knelt. Yesterday, he was a child.&nbsp;
            Tonight, he is something more. He was touched,                      by whom or what he didn’t know. But he would follow his destiny, his new life. So he came to the center of                      his old life, his best friend and
            companion, inseparable for these past seven years, who was dearer to him                      than his older brother, Lothund.<br>
            <br>
                      And he started to dig.<br>
