So we are killing, we are maiming, we are livin' it up rolelaying all the while for about an hour.

Heh.</P><P>Oh and by the way, when and if you get the urge to solo King Ak'anon at level 50 or less, don't. That cheating little shit nukes through walls and other obstacles.

I was feeling pretty uber and pretty over confident...BIG mistake.  Well, one popped and I was the only one to notice it right away so I went to go attack it.

I casted and landed lifetap like 3 or 4 times on one of the 2 specs, but no HP regained.  Of course I had died.</P><P>It turned out that the bard friend charmed one of the specs and sent it to attack the other one.  I didn't know this and happened to target the spec that was charmed.

Instead of running back out, I ran deeper into the arena, a gaggle of giants mashed me into the dirt. Got a port back to Neriak, bought a coffin, got a port to Ice Clad (closest I could find). Ran a ways into Kael and tried to summon. Got the you cannot summon message. At that point, I thought you could not summon anywhere in the zone, and proceeded to mount a tricky corpse recovery with the help of a couple friends (had no real idea where my corpse actually was). The cleric that ended up trying to rez me let me know that I could have summoned my corpse from the EW zone line. </P><P>-Was attempting to multi-quest a SS BP for a guildie, and thought that only he needed to have ally faction as the person to get the item, without realizing that I needed to be ally as well. (I still feel like a total ass for that one, sorry again Mord).</P><P>-The shear number of times I died before remapping the auto attack key from "A" to "~". </P><P>-Put my starting points into DEX rather then maxing out my INT all the way. </P><P>-Sold my Holgresh Elder Beads when I heard they were being nerfed to non-agro, thinking they would become useless (don't know what the hell I was thinking that day. Luckily, this one turned out in my favor as I bought them back a couple days after the nerf for a fraction of what I sold them for. </P><P>-In my early 50's, while I was farming Crystal Spider Silk, I was politely asked by a lowbie wizzie to help him get a Blacked Crystaline Robe. I walked in to the terror hallway, thinking I was all that, not bothering to think about what I was doing, after all, I can handle anything right? Wrong. Corpse was stuck in the wall at a weird angle, and I could not target it to drag it free. I tried all angles and clicking, go frustrated and accidentally hit the right mouse button, which of corse worked, and I started to loot my corpse. Invis dropped, and I had no spells up other then DMF and gather shadows. Death number 2.</P><P>-Had a brain fart trying to rez myself after I had died twice. After the smooke had cleared, I was down 3 EE's, and still managed to loot one corpse that was unrezzed.</P><P>-Though this one is not mine, a friend of mine spent like two solid weeks camping Xalgoz for the Staff of the Dreaded Gaze. It ended up being a simply INSANE number of hours he put into finally getting one. A few weeks later, he mistakenly sold it to a vendor in Neriak.

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Dumbest thing I have ever witnessed a GM do:</P><P>I was at the Lake of Ill Omen for an event on Stormhammer.  The point of the event was to fight for either good or evil.  Good and evil both had a guild which you were placed into before the event started.  The leader of the evil guild, which needless to say I joined, was CZ.  The leader of the good guild is Tunair (sp?  who cares).  It was pretty much just a kill fest with GM resurections being handed out left and right.  I died a bunch of times but was really just there for the spectacle.  Eventually good won the day and CZ died.</P><P>I looted my most recent corpse (love those 100% rezes) and decided to hang out at the bottom of the lake for a while to see how my level 49 pet could do against BGs down there.  I had just managed to agro two at once including the named one and was fighting for my life when some one asks "Could you do me a favor?"  I turn to see CZ standing behind me.  At that moment my pet dies and it is time to run for my life to the shore line.  I am surprised that I had not died at the shock of seeing CZ standing behind me.  I run for my life to the shore line and reach it with only about half a bubble.</P><P>A monent later, CZ shows up again and casts CH on me.  The GM in the guise of CZ explains that they are having trouble ending the event and wants my help.  Thats right, a Sormhammer GM nees me, a level 51 peon necro to help HIM.  Of course I accepted.  He makes me leader of the evil guild and asks me to type /guildpeace.  I do this but nothing happens.  I explain this to him and he ponders the situation for a bit.  It seems that because the two guilds are still at war, even though the event is techincly over, PCs are continuing to kill each other in large numbers and the GMs are getting tired of giving out rezies.</P><P>After a bit, the GM tells me that is is going to bring the other guild leader over.  Now, both CZ and Tunair (Tuna, whatever) are standing in front of me.  CZ tells me to target Tunair and try typing /guildpeace again.  At this exact monent, a level 59 ranger, and a member of the good guild, runs up and starts wailing on my necro ass.  With trembling hands I start typing / ... g ... u ... I am down to 50% ... i ... l ... d ... 25% i start typing faster ... p ... e ... a ... c ... e!</P><P>Suddenly everything stops.   I have the bearest sliver of life left and the ranger is completely pissed.  About 20 more PCs show up and everyone wants to know why they can't kill each other any more.  The GMs finish rezzing all the corpses and go away.  I don't think they even healed me.  I explain what had happened to the ranger and we both had a good laugh.</P><P>I later pieced together what the CZ GM had done wrong.  In order to end the event, he had removed himself from the guild.  He had assumed that this would cause the guild to dissolve since he was the leader of the guild.  For some reason this did not work.  Since he was no longer a member of the guild, he could not invite himself back into the guild.  He could not make one of the people fighting and killing each other guild leader because they would last about 30 seconds if he did that.  He went and found a solitary necro at the bottom of the lake with noone else around.  I was still a member of the guild so he could make me guild leader.  He did not know that you must target the other guild leader in order to perform /guildpeace.</P><P>In the end, I lost my original guild tag.  I guess they had some kind of script that automaticly restored guild tags for the other players but it did not work right for me.  They could not even put me back in my guild and no officers were on line at the time to help.  It took me a couple of days until I was able to get back in.  No big deal.</P><P>Well, that's my story and I am sticking to it.</P><P><BR> </font></td>
