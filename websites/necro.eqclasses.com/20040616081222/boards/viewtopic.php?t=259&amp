<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
This is a story of a young iksar. His tale is not one of glory, but of hardship. These trials and tribulations made him into the Lizard he is today... How do I know this? That Lizard is me... 
<br />

<br />
On a cold, dark night near the heart of Cabilis an Iksar was born to Prophet Sseznar and Warlord Sylria. The young Iksar's father, Sseznar, is a mighty shaman, who fought many battles next to Cabilis' greatest warriors, necromancers and shadowknights. He is regarded by all of Cabilis as one of the greatest shamans in it's long history. His mother, Sylria, is a warlord who fought many battles along side her mate. She is much younger and less distinguished than her mate, yet a powerful warrior nonetheless. For many years these two had tried to conceive. This was their final chance to bear an offspring as both were now aging past their fertile years... 
<br />

<br />
Their offspring was male. His name... Atropine. 
<br />

<br />
Sseznar was excstatic! A boy... Finally an heir to his legacy. This notion was instilled in the boy almost immediately after he was born. As he grew, the boy exhibited many of his mothers traits. He had exceptional stamina, and an aptitude for fighting. Even through all his fathers efforts, he wasn't terribly gifted in the magical arts. Burning with a desire to please his father, the young Atropine yearned to master the shamanistic arts. Yet, his mother secretly took pleasure at the speed her son learned the skills she taught to him. 
<br />

<br />
When he thought young Atropine was ready, his father admitted him to the Shaman guild at an age that only highly gifted students were admitted to. His son would learn from the best in Cabilis... 
<br />

<br />
Months passed. 
<br />

<br />
Atropine's peers had exceeded him in skill by many levels. He struggled to learn his most basic spells and chants. The simple cast of light healing drained him. Yet he struggled on, and mastered light healing, flash of light and inner fire. He lived a life of denial. He would go home and appease his aging father with stories of the new spells his peers struggled to learn, and how he was able to master them with ease. Yet he somehow always managed to avoid having to demonstrate his abilities. Atropine longed to make his father proud... 
<br />

<br />
More time passed. 
<br />

<br />
Then the darkest day of his life came. Atropine arrived at the shaman guild as usual to begin his training for the day, only to find his peers standing behind the guild master snickering in his direction. The guild master promptly told Atropine his performance as a shaman was disgraceful. And being the only son of Sseznar, that he should be ashamed. He was to be disbanded from the shaman guild and immediately leave the sacred shaman grounds. Atropine hung his head in shame and left the guild followed by laughter and humiliation. 
<br />

<br />
Now burdened with the thoughts of how he would have to tell his father about this, he wandered outside the walls of Cabilis into the Field of Bone. Depressed, he wandered a bit far outside the outskirts of town. Not paying attention, he inadvertently ran into a small group of 3 skeletons. Immediately they ATTACKED! With his hand to hand abilities taught to him by his mother, he was able to dispatch the first skeleton with ease. The remaining two skeletons wounded him greatly, but a few well placed strikes turned one of the skeletons into a pile of motionless bones. The now wounded Atropine tried to escape to the guards, but couldn't seem to move as fast with his deep wounds. Things looked bleak, and he almost longed for a quick death... 
<br />

<br />
The skeleton cackled as it loomed over him. It raised it's decayed fist to deliver the final strike. Atropine didn't want to die... something inside of him stirred. In his mind, he called out for help! With eyes closed, he anticipated death, but it did not come. He opened his eyes to see a young scaled wolf making short work of the skeleton...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
"Hello little friend, you saved my life." 
<br />

<br />
The scaled wolf looked proud, and came close to Atropine. Their eyes locked, and Atropine could almost feel an instinctual bond with the animal. He could sense it's intentions, and felt that he could almost communicate with it without a word. A second later, Atropine heard the a clatter of armor and knew the guards were headed this way. This meant danger for his new friend. He went to tell the scaled wolf to leave, but it was already gone. It was like the animal sensed his knowledge of the guards and fled. 
<br />

<br />
Atropine returned home from his time outside Cabilis to find his father in the entryway of their home standing with his great Spear of Fate in his hand. His mother, half cloaked in the darkness of a doorway, looked distressed. 
<br />

<br />
His father roared,"SON! YOU HAVE FAILED ME. YOU HAVE BROUGHT SHAME UPON OUR FAMILY!" 
<br />

<br />
Atropine was clearly shocked, and could only mutter,"But father..." 
<br />

<br />
Sseznar was clearly irate. He bellowed,"The Shaman guild master visited me today. You have been disbanded from the order of Cabilis shamans. You have lied to me and disgraced my name. YOU ARE NO LONGER MY SON!" 
<br />

<br />
With that Sseznar struck his son so hard that Atropine landed near the entrance to the house. Stunned he couldn't get off the floor. His father moved with speed toward the door, opened it, and threw the boy out into the streets of Cabilis. 
<br />

<br />
Sseznar's voice boomed,"YOU ARE NOT MY SON... AND YOU ARE NOT WELCOME IN THIS HOUSE. GET OUT OF MY SIGHT! YOU ARE A DISGRACE!!" 
<br />

<br />
And the door slammed shut. 
<br />

<br />
Atropine wandered the streets now completely without family, direction or purpose. It seemed to him the whole city knew what had happend, his disgrace. Even the froglok slaves seemed to snicker at him before the slave drivers quieted them. Slowly he made his way towards the field of bone. There was nothing here for him now. Atropine was all alone...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
"Do not be afraid," the voice said. 
<br />

<br />
Immediately Atropine recognized the voice as his mothers. It sounded different somehow though. His mother had been crying... 
<br />

<br />
"Here son, take these. " 
<br />

<br />
She handed him two polished ulaks that he had trained with years ago. 
<br />

<br />
"These weapons are all I could take without your father noticing." 
<br />

<br />
Then she handed Atropine a backpack full of provisions and water. 
<br />

<br />
"Son, you may never return home, yet you will always be my son. Make a new life for yourself outside these walls. The dangers you face will be great, just know I will always be with you." 
<br />

<br />
She then placed her hand over his heart. 
<br />

<br />
"Right here." 
<br />

<br />
Almost as suddenly as she appeared in the darkness, she disappeared. Atropine was now truly on his own. 
<br />

<br />
Armed with his 2 Ulaks, he strode out with a heavy heart out into the Field of Bone...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
The sky was filled with dark, forbidding clouds. Thunder claps boomed in the distance. A heavy rain drenched the ruins outside the entrance of cabilis in the field of bone. It was late in the day, and Atropine's thoughts were still on his mother. 
<br />

<br />
"...I am really on my own now. I have no knowledge of this world, and nowhere to go. How could I let this happen... What am I going to do now?" 
<br />

<br />
His thoughts dominated his consciousness. He barely noticed where he was walking. Lightning crackled through the sky, lighting up the darkness of the Cabilis ruins. 
<br />

<br />
Atropine walked aimlessly past the ruins when a bolt of lightning lit up the shadows and revealed a crouched form huddled just inside one of the ruins. Atropine snapped out of his introversion and became acutely aware that he was not alone. He felt his grip tighten around the Ulak's his mother had given him. 
<br />

<br />
A voice rang out through the downpour... "Who goes there?" 
<br />

<br />
Atropine responed, "Just an outcast, no one to concern yourself with." 
<br />

<br />
The voice again sounded, muffled by the rain, "Will you help an aged traveler with some food and maybe a drink?" 
<br />

<br />
Wary of this situation, Atropine crept closer to get a look at this traveler. The darkened sky and rain made it almost impossible to discern exactly who this traveler was. Closer and closer he crept... Another bolt of lighting lit up the sky, and Atropine was able to clearly see an aged iksar huddled in the doorway of the ruins.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
"You look like you are lost. What brings such a young lizard to the dangers of the field of bone?" 
<br />

<br />
Atropine almost didn't know what to say, or where to start. He could only mutter, "I'm on my own now. There is nothing left for me in Cabilis." 
<br />

<br />
The old Iksar replied, "HA... you sound like a young Iksar I used to know... Now, about that food, would you mind sharing some with a hungry traveler?" 
<br />

<br />
With that Atropine reached into his bag and procured 2 rations and a flask of water. The two finished off the rations and water in what seemed like an instant. More relaxed, the old Iksar sat back and pulled his cloak tighter around himself. 
<br />

<br />
"You know this world is larger than you could ever have imagined young Iksar. I have been from one end to the other... and beyond. Kunark is but a small continent on the face of Norrath. Travel beyond the field of bone is incredibly dangerous for someone as young as yourself..." 
<br />

<br />
"Why are you here then, huddled in the ruins outside of Cabilis?" asked Atropine. 
<br />

<br />
The old Iksar straightened and looked directly into Atropine's eyes and spoke... 
<br />

<br />
"My name is Ventaz and I am dying. I have come to the end of this life. I never thought I would live to see a death of old age. Many times have I longed to die in the heat of battle, yet my skills as a warrior that were a boon during the height of my life, are a curse now in my twilight years. Almost a year ago I gave up my swords, buried in my only son's grave. He died in battle next to me, and I was unable to save him from death. My only solace was to slay the beast that took the life of my son. Now, I wander from place to place. A drifter, a begger... awaiting my time to join Cazic-Thule and my son." 
<br />

<br />
Atropine looked away as the old Iksar's gaze seemed to penetrate his scales and see his thoughts. 
<br />

<br />
"Now then, what is your name and how is it that such a young Iksar is on his own?" asked the old Lizard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
The old Iksar looked confused and said, "No need to rush off boy. I did not mean to offend you. I just haven't talked to anyone in days, I'm just trying to make conversation. Please relax and keep this old lizard company for a while longer." 
<br />

<br />
Atropine slouched, turned around and dropped to the floor trying to find a comfortable spot on the rock floor. After a long silence, he asked, "So now that I am out here on my own, where do I go? What am I to do with myself?" 
<br />

<br />
The old Iksar seemed pleased with this question. 
<br />

<br />
"You will train your body and mind against creatures great and small. You will gain skill in your chosen path, and become more powerful with every triumph. Seek out others on the same path as you, and learn from them. Find a common guild or association to learn new skills and garner knowledge of the magical arts, if that is your path. Now young lizard, what is your chosen path?" 
<br />

<br />
Atropine fidgeted, noticibly disturbed by the question. After a long pause, he managed to get out that he was trained as a shaman, but wasn't very good at it. He also said that he enjoyed the thrill of battle far more than the sedentary lifestyle of a caster. The old Iksar took this as his queue and said, "You have much to learn about his world young Atropine. Let us get some rest, and tomorrow I will teach you more about this world you are about to enter." 
<br />

<br />
With that the old Iksar laid down and seemed to immediately fall asleep. Atropine did the same and he drifted off to sleep, tormented by dreams of unimaginable horrors and feelings of loneliness... 
<br />

<br />
He awoke to a ray of sunlight beating down on his scaled head, with a slow drip from the nights rain, landing on him from a crack in the ceiling. Looking around, his eyes adjusting to the morning light, he saw the old Iksar standing outside the doorway... 
<br />

<br />
Ventaz said, "Get up, it is time for us to be on our way." 
<br />

<br />
Atropine got up, packed his things and left with the old Iksar, even more unsure now of where he was headed...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
WOOSSSH... Ventaz's fist missed Atropine by less than an inch. Atropine instinctively crouched, then sprung toward Ventaz landing 2 quick blows to the sternum, knocking Ventaz back a step. 
<br />

<br />
Ventaz straightened from the blows, clearly not phased by either of them and looked pleased... 
<br />

<br />
"GOOD! Very good. Your hand to hand skills have improved signifigantly since we started this morning. Take a break, and lets get something to eat." 
<br />

<br />
Ventaz thought to himself, "this boy has potential. His hand to hand skills already exceed mine when I was that age. He does not have the warrior mentality though... I wonder..." 
<br />

<br />
Atropine slowly walked over to the shade of a nearby tree and slumped down while rubbing his shoulders. This was the hardest he had trained in a long time, since before he went to train as a Shaman. His muscles ached from taking so many blows from Ventaz. Slowly he began the incantation that now seemed to come with ease. Soon his body was covered in a light blue glow, the pain was soothed and dissipated into nothingness. 
<br />

<br />
His thoughts drifted off to the events of the day. Ventaz had led him to a somewhat secluded spot in the field of bone. He didn't see many dangerous creatures here. After they had set up a camp, Ventaz had offered to prepare him for some of the dangers that lie ahead. Atropine never thought that such an old reptile could train so hard...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
"Get up boy, we aren't done for the day" said Ventaz. 
<br />

<br />
Tired, but fully healed, Atropine lifted himself off the ground and moved towards Ventaz. 
<br />

<br />
"You are moving to slowly! You open yourself to attack." 
<br />

<br />
A swift kick caught Atropine off guard and struck him hard in the midsection. A large scaled fist followed that and struck him in the square in the jaw, lifting Atropine off of his feet, and sending him a foot or two backwards, leaving him sprawled on the ground stunned. 
<br />

<br />
Out of nowhere sprang the young scaled wolf that had come to Atropine's defense a day before. Knocking Ventaz down, the scaled wolf released a deep growl and beared its fangs... A swift strike knocked the scaled wolf off of Ventaz before the young wolf could sink it's teeth into Ventaz's throat. With surprising agility, Ventaz sprung to his feet after knocking the young scaled wolf away and prepared to deliver the final blow to dispatch of this scaled wolf. 
<br />

<br />
"NOOOOOO!!!" cried Atropine. 
<br />

<br />
Atropine lept forward and tackled Ventaz away from the wolf. The scaled wolf moved forward intent on defending Atropine, even if it meant his death... 
<br />

<br />
Atropine's eyes again locked with the scaled wolf. He projected his thoughts,"this is a friend." Without a word spoken by Atropine, the young scaled wolf calmed down and backed off. 
<br />

<br />
Ventaz and Atropine got up and dusted themselves off. They both walked back to the camp in silence, the young scaled wolf following the two at a short distance. Ventaz seemed deep in thought, and finally he spoke... 
<br />

<br />
"Atropine, it seems you have a mastery of communication with this beast. I have seen this before... and I know where we must go. Will you come with me and learn of the possibilities that lie ahead of you? 
<br />

<br />
A bit startled by this revelation Ventaz had, Atropine stuttered out an reply. 
<br />

<br />
"Possibilities? What possibilities?" 
<br />

<br />
"The path you now walk is one that not many in this world choose. It seems that this path has chosen you. You are one of very few... I know of someone that can help guide you, if you will come with me" said Ventaz. 
<br />

<br />
Atropine, still unsure of what Ventaz meant, wanted to know more about where they were going to travel. 
<br />

<br />
"Where are we going?" 
<br />

<br />
"We will be going to a place of timeless knowledge. Far, far from you home is where we will be going. You will be exposed to almost every race of being that inhabits Norrath... and beyond. It will be quite a shock at first, but I'm sure you will grow accustomed to the place" replied Ventaz. 
<br />

<br />
Atropine's thoughts raced through his mind... "I'm not sure if I want to go so far away from my home. But I cannot go back to Cabilis now... If I were to stay here in the field of bone, I would have to live off the land. I have no direction, and what do I have to lose?" 
<br />

<br />
After what seemed like an eternity to Atropine, he spoke and said,"Alright, I have nothing to lose and nowhere to go. I will go with you."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
Ventaz left the camp to hunt for dinner. Over the next couple hours, Atropine and his young scaled wolf friend played and wrestled. Time passed quickly and it was soon dark. Shortly after sunset, Ventaz returned dragging a gigantic scorpion behind him. Scorpion was one of Atropine's favorite meals. The started a fire and cooked the scorpion in its shell after removing the poisonous tip of it's tail. The 3 companions feasted on the scorpion meat... All 3 soon fell asleep. 
<br />

<br />
As the sun broke over the hillside, casting rays of sunlight through the tree branches, Atropine awoke to the scaled wolf nudging him slightly. The old Iksar had already packed up the camp and was awaiting Atropine some 10 yards away. 
<br />

<br />
"Get up boy, it is time for us to leave" bellowed Ventaz. 
<br />

<br />
Quickly Atropine gathered his things, carefully placing the two Ulaks his mother gave him in his backpack. He got up and chased after Ventaz who had already begun walking. The scaled wolf followed close behind. The journey wasn't a long one. Then Atropine saw something he had never seen before... a large polished stone pillar with a open faced stone book sitting on top of it. The pillar and book seemed to glow with an unknown power. 
<br />

<br />
Ventaz reached the book first and said,"Say goodbye to your friend Atropine. He cannot travel with us through this portal." 
<br />

<br />
Visibly disturbed by this, Atropine knelt down next to the young scaled wolf. Their eyes locked and the scaled wolf seemed to understand. 
<br />

<br />
"Don't worry my friend, I'll be back." 
<br />

<br />
"Atropine, place your hand on the book and you will be transported to a place of wonder. We are going to the Plane of Knowledge." 
<br />

<br />
Almost as soon as he finished, Ventaz placed his hand on the book and disappeared. Atropine apprehensively reached towards the book, and made contact... 
<br />

<br />
Everything turned into a blur of lights and he all of a sudden felt completely weightless, outside the bounds of normal reality...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />

<br />
...A moment later, Atropine snapped back into reality. It was as if he was awoken from a comfortable sleep into a completely different place. His eyes slowly adjusted, and as he looked around his other senses began to pick up oddities that he had never experienced before. 
<br />

<br />
For Atropine the first few minutes in this Plane of Knowledge were a sensory overload. In the background there was a constant buzz of loud voices, small voices, languages he did not understand... clattering of armor, music of the likes that he had never heard before as well as shouts of people buying or selling wares. The ambient noise of this place by itself seemed to overwhelm and consume him. 
<br />

<br />
The initial visual scene he dropped in to reminded him much of a greener Cabilis. The buildings were made completely of aged and weathered stone. Dead, withered trees lined the streets, and dark races of all types seemed to guard this place. There were forbidding looking stones with twisted horns and placards of places he had only heard of... 
<br />

<br />
Atropine was snapped out of his sensory transfiction of this new place with a slap on the back and a familiar voice. 
<br />

<br />
"Snap out of it boy. You will quickly become accustomed to this place. I know it's a lot at first, but we have business to attend to" said Ventaz. 
<br />

<br />
"Follow me." 
<br />

<br />
With that Ventaz strode off towards a large stone arch guarded by an Iksar and a Troll in full armor. Still in a state of bewilderment, Atropine instinctively followed Ventaz with his eyes wide... looking from side to side trying to take everything in. 
<br />

<br />
The two passed through the arch, and it was like Atropine had again stepped into a different world. The buildings on the other side of the arch seemed to be made of polished stone. The streets were immaculate, as were the sprawling lush green lawns that separated the streets and buildings. Massive twisted healthy trees grew from the ground. A large tower with an arching walkway that seemed to disappear over a wall hovered in the distance high above him. This was truly unlike a place he had ever been. 
<br />

<br />
As Atropine took few steps into this new area, following Ventaz, and the main street came into full view. Awestruck, Atropine stood there with his eyes wide as saucers almost forgetting to breath. This place was filled with races of men, women, elves, gnomes, halflings, dwarves and races he had only seen pictures of. Immediately he felt exposed and in danger. Ever since he was a young reptile he was warned of the dangers associated with these creatures. Their hatred of the Iksar race ran deep. Instinctively he got off the street and behind the corner of the closest building. 
<br />

<br />
Ventaz chuckled, and walked camly over to the apprehensive Iksar..."Do not be afraid young Atropine. The creatures who venture to this place come in search of knowledge, through peace and tolerance. You have nothing to fear in terms of bodily harm here from the denziens and travelers in the Plane of Knowledge. Please, we must continue, we are very close now."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">As they turned the corner, Ventaz walked directly towards one of the white stone buildings. A huge stone door with a symbol like Atropine had never seen before stood before them. Ventaz placed his hand on the symbol, and the giant stone door slid open with a slight grating sound of stone rubbing against stone. 
<br />

<br />
"Inside lies a path for you Atropine. Your destiny lies before you. It is up to you to decide whether or not this is the path you will walk. I cannot go with you for this. I have business elsewhere to take care of. When you are done here, make your way to the bank. I will be there waiting for you. Good luck boy." With that, Ventaz clapped Atropine on the shoulder, and left him standing in front of the building alone. 
<br />

<br />
Atropine entered the building. The walls on the inside were made of the same polished white stone he had seen everywhere else. Large bookcases lined the walls with ancient tomes filling them. Walking in to the main room, he saw two elder beings. One was a gnome, the other a high elf. 
<br />

<br />
"Why would Ventaz lead me here?" thought Atropine. 
<br />

<br />
Then he noticed a door to his left. Atropine all of a sudden got a funny feeling in his stomach. As he looked at the door, he felt nervous, and like he was sinking into the floor. He took a few steps toward the door, and place his hand on the handle and prepared to open it. 
<br />

<br />
"Whatever is behind this door, may not have the answers I am looking for... I can't get my hopes up" thought Atropine. 
<br />

<br />
He opened the door and entered a somewhat smaller room. He entered the room and was again struck with awe at what was in front of him. Towering before him was a large Noble looking feline creature. His muscles bulged underneath a soft layer of brightly colored orange, yellow and white fur with black and grey markings. His ears perked up towards Atropine and the felines large yellow eyes set directly on him. The feline spoke... 
<br />

<br />
"Hello young traveler. What is it you seek?" 
<br />

<br />
"I am here to find my path. Who am I and what am I to become?" said Atropine. 
<br />

<br />
"Come here boy. Let me test your worthiness." 
<br />

<br />
Atropine's thoughts raced. He had not been worthy to be a Cabilis Shaman. How could this be any different. Still he stepped forward, and the feline placed his hand on Atropine's head. 
<br />

<br />
With his eyes closed, the noble cat seemed to be deep in meditative thought. Slowly his eyes opened again and settled, looking directly into Atropine's eyes... 
<br />

<br />
"Young Iksar, you have found your path. I sensed that you have already created a bond with a scaled wolf. You have a natural affinity with animals of all kinds. Your spirit is infused with a harmony and balance with nature and it's creatures that few ever know. This bond you have with the scaled wolf is your path. I will train you in the ways of the beastlord." 
<br />

<br />
Atropine's heart skipped a beat. His pulse raced and he felt excitement and pride welling up inside of him. 
<br />

<br />
Atropine was able to stammer,"Tha..Thank you!" 
<br />

<br />
"Good! We will begin now. I have sensed your abilities with magic. You are already well ahead of most young beastlords. Follow me young beastlord." 
<br />

<br />
The noble feline led Atropine out into the main room. Pulling a large, dusty leather tube off the top of one of the bookshelves, he handed it to Atropine and told him to open it. 
<br />

<br />
"This is what sets you apart from all others. Inside are three scrolls which are exclusive to beastlords. With the first, you will be able to summon your warder to your side from anywhere, and at any time. Your warder is the nimal that you have bonded with. They are your lifelong companions, as well as your lifeline. The next scroll will provide you with the power to infuse your warder with a feral power that allows them to strike your enemies with different elemental forces. The final scroll allows you to heal your warder with a far greater aptitude than you can heal yourself or others. Take your time to scribe these three scrolls into your spellbook, and then we will continue your training."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
