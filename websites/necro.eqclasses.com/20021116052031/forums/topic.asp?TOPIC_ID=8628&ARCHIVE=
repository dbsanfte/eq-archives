After my jaunt to the frozen sea of Iceclad, it's good to be back, if not AT home, then somewhat close TO home. </P><P>I had taken a break and decided to head to Timorous Deep to acquire some Ogre Meat(for Ogre meat Jerky treats, naturally) for my Scaled Wolf hound. </P><P>Ye Gods! Look at those marvelous birds! Or are they men! They're Bird Men! The best of both worlds! Ah time to set up camp for a while. </P><P>I summoned an undead minion of the damned and went to work, merrily slaughtering red feathered creatures. <BR>Willy - Nilly, I strode. </P><P>Yowsa! This is TOO easy. </P><P>Then - I see a dog. <BR>A white dog. <BR>Runs right by me. </P><P>"Hey whachas..." Wow he's Fast! </P><P>Hello Mr Doggi..." There he goes again, running in circles.... </P><P>Hey' How's abou... the ...." <BR>Oh well , he looks like he's having fun. </P><P>He just grabbed my bird. <BR>And another. <BR>And another. <BR>And another. <BR>And one more for spite, I suppose. </P><P>Wow! I had heard of quad kiting, but I had never seen it ! Oh joy! To watch a level 49 druid in action! </P><P>WOW! That dudes getting hit! A LOT! <BR>He's at half life! Glad i'm just meddding and watching the show. I'm sure he's got it under control. </P><P>Hmmmmm. He seems to be "quad kiting" in MY direction. I better move over a lit... DEAR GOD HE'S COMING STRAIGHT FOR ME!!! </P><P>Ah. But Boney is sauve. Hello Mr. Sow potion.  </P><P>See, Boney - Boney doesn't make a lot of friends. BUT Boney DOES make a lot of cash - soloing. And he ain't stingy at the local alchemy shop. </P><P><BR>Imagine an iksar Necro, kiting a Druid , kiting 5 mobs. </P><P>Imagine snare breaking. </P><P>Now imagine the feeling that druid had that he just COULDN'T catch up to Ol' Bonesmasher and trade some mob aggro before he died. </P><P><BR>Man those 5 mobs were so low too. </P><P>I near 'bout cried when i polished them off, <BR>one by one. </P><P>And I looked at his corpse and I kicked it and I laughed and laughed and laughed. </P><P><BR>Quad kiting, indeed.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         uhh great story, but I kinda feel like the fat kid in "Stand By Me" at then end of the barfing story, what happened next? I don't get it? That ending sucked... lol tell us more (=<BR>/incoming my story</P><P>I'm not too grammatically literate in writing or what not but I was bored as hell at work today and decided to write a little story... Hope ya enjoy it or at least gives you something to do after you've read castsers realm/ everlore/ etc etc and Servers still aren't up or can't play for whatever reason (= </P><P>Heading to the new found land of Stone Brunt mountains, Dobi, the seasoned Pale skin Enchanter of 55 seasons, bent over for a drink of water before heading east along the rock ledge to enter Paineel. Caught up in the sound of the water lightly falling onto the bank of the river, Dobi cast upon himself a 3rd level rune of magical skin to absorb any attacks from wanderers that may wish him harm and quickly fell into a comfortable spring time nap.<BR>Hours passed when he awoke to feeling the slight tap-tap-tapping from the kicks and punches of a very weak skeleton attacking him, but far from making it through his magical skin. Groggy and a little annoyed at his assailant Dobi flipped through to the third page of his book of magic as to find a not so powerful spell just to ward off this feeble attacker and not to assault it too terribly bad. When to his greater annoyance he noticed this wasn't just a skeleton this was a set of animated bones. Who of such great will and feeble mind would dare attack a High Elf of his stature? A quick cast of Sentient to see who the master of this nuisance is. Lo-and-behold there is the master, a young iksar running away, necro or shadow knight it must be to have animated these bones.</P><P>A quick area effect stun and a root put this iksars pet in check. "Now to deal with this foolish lizard," Dobi thought to himself. Quickly Dobi decided that death was no answer for this lizard, after all, hunting in Sebilis for so long he has an obligation to keep his faction up with the Legion of Cabilis. "You there lizard" Dobi shouted out calmly, "The master of Jebartik here, come to me or be slain." The root broke on the pet and his pathetic fury was once again brought upon Dobi. Starting to get aggravated now Dobi once again rooted the animated bones and considered turning it into a pile of bones once again, but with its kicks and punches being so pathetic, the owner must be weak as well and I'd hate to put him out the components or mana to cast another. </P><P>Dobi sends out a message directly to his younger druid friend, Pindagon, to teleport himself to Toxxulas forest to help track down this little menace. Minutes later Pindagon, in wolf form, is seen running towards Dobi, anxiously anticipating some action. "Calm down there wolfy, this isn't a seek and destroy, only a seek and educate old chum." They form a group and after a few customary mind buffs and spirit buffs they take off in the direction the iksar was running. </P><P>Quickly Pindagons' keen nose picks up the scent of the lizard and the hunt is on. Heading north to the fork in the water suddenly loses the lizards scent. "He must of crossed here" Pindagon growled. Dobi sighs as he senses Pin's frustration (Pin has a fear of water, he must, after over 50 seasons he still barely has the swimming skill of a newborn iksar, silly wolf,) and suggest we run up to the bridge and around to the other side and see if we can pick up his scent again. Making a snide comment that he hopes he hasn't made it across sister isle by now or leveled up high enough to defeat himself (trying to encourage Pin to work on his swimming skill for the umpteenth time.)<BR>Finally after getting to the other side of the fork in the water to try and pick up the lizards scent, there is still a faint moistness and claw prints heading back down the bank. Following the prints we farther north Pin finally picks up the scent again and it heads deeper into the forest. Pin points off northeast and says "I sense him towards the entrance of Erudin, this could turn out to be a search and rescue if the Erudins catch up to him before we do." "Well lead on pooch" Dobi replies to the wolf form. <BR>Lo-and- behold a few paces from a hut outside Erudin there's an Erudite Sentinel carefully eyeing the dead iksar. Dobi sighs, well, 'twas fun while it lasted, I spose I tried. Pin says, "Don't be so sure, I still have him on my track, therefore he must still be alive and feigning death, and doing a fine job I must say." Dobi perks up, indeed he is, he had me fooled as well. Dobi walks up to the feigned iksar, hails the Sentinel, whom is still a little weiry that the iksar died so quickly after one slash. "Silly iksar so far from home, shall I remove this filth before it stinks up your land, I imagine I can get a few copper for it in Katta Isle, the cats will surely enjoy the delicatessen?" Dobi asked the sentinel. "Sure, but do it fast, that way I don't have to fill out a report, no reason <BR>to get the city stirred up over a single occurrence. I'm sure this is nothing that the rest of the city needs to know about, and my shift is over as soon as I get back" the sentinel replied.<BR>Dobi whispered to Pin, have your snare ready in case he decides to kick when we get out of site, also cast a strength spell on me. Having the newly found strength Dobi picked up the feigned iksar and tossed him over his shoulders and could feel the lizard cringe as if dodging one train to step into the path of another. "Will take him to Katta and help him out a little, you have anything better to do?" Dobi whispered to Pin. "Naw, can't do anything without your clarity anyhow Dobi" Replied Pin feeble and weak minded. Dobi sighs.<BR>Now on the shore about to cross over to get to the cat outpost of Katta Isle, Dobi turns to the fifth page in his spell book and quickly mems his latest Charm line of spells and casts it upon the lizard. Soon the lizard mumbles, "Dobi is my master" and they are on there way across the waterway. Once across the water way and outside the entrance to Katta Isle, Dobi breaks his charm spell on the lizard and traps him from going anywhere darting from one corner to another. Realizing he's stuck, the lizard feigns death once again. "Oh get up young'n if I was to harm you I would have given you back to the sentinels. Now stop fighting it and stand up like a man. "I'm no man, I'm a female" the lizard hissed back at Dobi. Dobi blushed. "And leave me be or my undead servants shall send you to Cazic-Thule" she hissed again at Dobi. Dobi chuckled. "You are a feisty one aren't you there lizard woman, or girl I should say, just calm down you will not be harmed I assure you. Matter of factly you have brought some excitement to a rather dull day for an old chanter and his Dog... err hum friend, meet Pindagon, a wood elf druid of 51 seasons and I am Dobi a high elf enchanter of 54 seasons." *Pindagon nods at the iksar* The iksar whips its neck towards Pin and hisses as it slithers its tongue in and out. "Now young friend what is your name? Why are you so scorn at me? I have killed many a frog in Sebillis, my faction with your race could not get any better" Dobi inquired.<BR>The iksar changed its tune slightly and sat down in the corner still a little weary. "I have no name. After doing a few feeble quests in my home city of Cabilis I made my way out to the Lake of Ill Omen and was hunting when I ventured far from home and had no idea where to go. Most of the people I encountered in the lake area were idiots or "too good" to help a feeble lizard like me. Until one day I happened upon a pale and sssoft ssskin creature very similar to you, he said he would take me back to cab for a price of 5 food, so I quickly went to foraging. Minutes later I returned back to him with 5 pieces of foraged fruit and vegetables and he said okay, now I shall take you to your city.<BR>We grouped up and he started to cast a spell, quickly I glanced around to see what he was casting on, when it was too late. I found myself here in this forest in the middle of some tall spires. The pale sssoft ssskin told me to never come back to Kunark or he would be sure to hunt me down and kill me. I don't understand what was wrong with him or what he was so scorn for but I found myself stuck here with no help and no direction."<BR>Dobi feeling his heart sink. "Ahh thats horrible, I hope you don't hold our whole race responsible for what that evil wizard had done to you." Dobi pleaded. "How bout I take you under my wing and I will take responsibility for you?" "I need no one to care for me, I've been here for 9 seasons now, I'm almost 20!!" exclaimed the lizard" Dobi jumps back jokingly, "Look here I am 54 seasons, over 30 above you, your finest pet can't even touch me, now you don't even want a few hand me downs? I'm trying to make amends with you over something I'm not even responsible for. Dobi starts to turn and walk away while listening for argument" Come on Pin, lets go, I've wasted enough time." "WAIT WAIT, okay I will gladly accept your assistance I apologize for being so hateful. please forgive me, I desperately would like to cover up my pink panties. I will gladly accept anything you need and when I'm older I'll kill anything that bothers you, I'm already hated <BR>by everyone so I haven't much to offer but that" the lizard pleaded.<BR>"GREAT!!" Dobi exclaimed, " First we must give you a name, mine is Dobi Wonkenobi, I am fairly well known across this world. We will call you Dobiwon to help others know that you are an apprentice of mine and that should give you safe passage and many friends by association as you travel. Now take these items, equip them, take this money and use it as needed as well, and last but not least here's a few stacks of food and water, I will be back now and then to give you newer and better items as you get older, I may also send you friends of mine to check on your or bring you supplies of all races and genders so please, as you have learned today, don't ever judge a book by its cover. The way you can always tell if it is friend of foe, is if they hail you with a y0! Good luck, safe journeys and may you level quickly and safely.</P><P>Dobiwon became quite fond of Dobi, learning of his abilities to change shape and convince others to do most anything he wanted or needed, juts by the wave of his hand in front of there eyes or the cast of a spell. As Dobi became quite fond of the young Dobiwon as well, lurking in the shadows. Not being liked seemed somewhat appealing to Dobi. It was an opposites attract, while Dobi was liked by everyone and strived to be liked more by others, Dobiwon was hated and thrived on that hate. Dobiwons skills increased so that Katta isle was quite boring and she couldn't wait for Dobi to come take her away from this place. </P><P>Time passed by and by Dobiwon trained in the dark art of necromancy on the cats of Katta isle until she could no longer benefit and slaying them became mundane and tiresome. As time went by Dobiwon learned of many races and classes of the lightskins, both dark skinned and lightskinned. Of these folks there was Shaftin, the erudite Wizard who often brought Dobi over to Toxxulous wizard, or even brought Dobiwon food and water when Dobi couldn't make it (undoubtedly on some mission to improve his faction somewhere or ridding those evil planes of the higher level enemies.) Also there was Siminix the apprentice of Shaftin, a scaled one like myself, but of the monk class. He could easily out damage Dobiwon and her pet with his swift <BR>punches and powerful feet. Pindagons little apprentice Pinnorz also made a few appearences although not as often. He was a Wood Elf of the Rogue Class, he was a very powerful damage dealer but whined too much about a master not being around to protect him. But soon would be the last time Dobiwon would see any of her friends for about 30 seasons, she was bound and determined to catch up to if not equal her master.</P><P>Dobi was becoming tired anyhow, removing the world of the same enemies in order of there appearence was becoming less and less rewarding and the seasons were getting longer and longer. Dobi was more enjoying the gratification of giving Dobiwon the rewards then selling them or keeping them himself. Before the 20th season, Dobiwon was just as well equipped if not better for her class then Dobi was for his own. Then the day came when Dobiwon would venture out of Katta Isle and truly become the evil being she felt toiling inside her. </P><P><BR>Her first venture was to the frozen tundra of Everfrost, with her dark and boiling spells it seemed only appropriate to hunt against those creatures that like the cold and whiteness of the snowy land. There were very large creatures in this zone as well as small, but none any less powerful then the other. There were monstrous Wooly mammoths and there not much less monstrous mammoth calves, Tundra spiders that could cover her and swallow her whole, Orcs of many classes, rogue orcs, shaman orcs, wizard orcs, even warrior orcs, she avoided all of these at most costs. The orcs were very immune to magic and Dobiwon wasn't much of the pick up a weapon and destoy type. Even her harvester which very much resembeled a large and powerful scythe, like the grim reaper,had no meleeing ability, it was strictly to help her magic skills.<BR>Hunting in everfrost helped Dobiwon perfect her fear skill as well, She cast her darken spell which slows them down, then make her animated bone pet attack the enemy then due to her extremely low charisma she would cast a fear spell up on them that would send them running away screaming mercy. While running away scared she would send her pet after her and cast her slow death spells on them. Growing tired and being cold blooded Dobiwon quickly found herself locking up and just being just plain cold. She set off to find a new stomping ground.</P><P><BR>56 Leezard Defiler of Tunare<BR>\/ \/ \/ \/ Mah crappy gear\/ \/ \/ \/<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=208823" target="_blank">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=208823</a> (Hunting)<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=343303" target="_blank">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=343303</a>  (resists)</P><P></P><P>Edited by - Dobi on 09/19/2002  16:47:43<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
