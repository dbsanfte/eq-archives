  <br>

  Ogres are extremely large, strong and simple-minded creatures, 

  who are constantly looking for ways to fill their big hairy bellies. Since they 

  are usually the largest creatures around, they tend to assume that &quot;bigger is 

  better&quot; and tease or bully those smaller than themselves. Their home city of 

  Oggok is a series of caves carved out of the living rock and is full of simple 

  stone structures. Most Ogres are easily amused, easily fooled, easily frustrated 

  and quick-tempered (especially if they are hungry). Ogre society basically revolves 

  around proving who is bigger and/or stronger and Ogres often get into

  fights over the smallest things. Ogres don't like to actually think to solve 

  their problems. It is much simpler (and more fun) to smash whatever (or whoever) 

  is causing the problem. Problem not solved? Add one more Ogre to try to&nbsp; 

  smash the problem (repeat until the problem is solved or you run out of Ogres). 

  This constant fighting and the fact that most Ogre games are amazingly destructive 

  and violent are two causes of the Ogre race's devastating strength and combat 

  skills.

  Once enraged an Ogre can think of NOTHING other than crushing the source of 

  his or her frustration. Do NOT get in the way of an angry Ogre&#133;</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0">Ogres do most of their thinking (when they do think) on the 

  subject of FOOD and DRINK (and in the case of Shadowknights, planning cruel 

  new tortures for their victims). Generally when Ogres run out of things to eat 

  in and around Oggok, they will raid the settlements of the smaller races, destroying 

  the buildings, eating the livestock and quite often

  eating the farmers who raised the livestock. With their bellies full, the Ogres 

  happily travel back to Oggok singing songs and bragging about who did the most 

  damage, who was the most cruel, who ate the most food, and who drank the most! 

  Unfortunately, most other races don't seem to appreciate this type of behavior, 

  so Ogres are quite unpopular with most other races. Also contributing to their 

  lack of popularity is the fact that Ogres don't seem to care too much for personal 

  hygiene. And what do the Ogres think about this? </font>

  <br>
  The Ogre Warrior</font></a></u></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><a href="../ogre.html#top"><br>
  <br>
  </a>Ogre Warriors are the biggest of the big, the baddest

of the bad, and the strongest of the strong. Unfortunately, they're also

the dumbest of the dumb. It is rare to find an Ogre Warrior that doesn't

need help to count higher than the number of fingers on one battle scarred

hand. But, most Ogre Warriors just don't care about all that thinking stuff.

As long as there is food in their stomachs and things to crush beneath

their huge smelly feet they are content. Ogre Warriors live for the opportunity

to prove their physical superiority to all others and will usually charge

into battle without any type of a plan other than to physically overwhelm

their opponent.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0">Because of their size and strength Ogre Warriors generally

feel that they have no need to use magic spells (besides those scrolls

are too tough to read, anyway.. stupid words). However, they don't mind

being healed, and actually like being magically strengthened (even if they

are not really sure what is going on, magic makes pretty lights). Ogre

Warriors will use magic weapons and armor, if they feel it helps them smash

things better.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0">Ogre Warriors crave destruction almost as much as they

crave food. This works itself out nicely because Ogre Warriors generally

try to eat whatever (or whoever) they destroy. Special delicacies for an

Ogre Warrior include: Dwarf heads, mixed with whole Gnome's by the handful

(Mmmmmm). Elves tend to be a bit too spicy (especially dark elves) and

trolls can cause a bad case of indigestion. But, a nice plump halfling

or human bar-b-qued on the grill is a special treat no Ogre would pass

up. Unfortunately, most Ogres don't eat that well all the time, and so

they have to satisfy their insatiable hunger with whatever animals they

can kill (and any other object that looks tasty, for example: colorful

rocks). Additionally, some Ogre Warriors have been known to supplement

their diet with massive amounts of alcohol.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0">During their youth, all Ogres (male and female) are &quot;groomed&quot;

to become warriors. Young Ogres are taught &quot;da hedbut game&quot; as a way to

build community, establish a social structure, and prove their strength

(without killing each other). This practice is rumored by some to be one

of many probable causes of the Ogre race's generally limited intelligence.

Ogre Warriors continue to practice &quot;da hedbut game&quot; through adulthood just

for fun. Young Ogres that are exceptionally smart (poor things) or exceptionally evil (blessed by the Shadow

god) tend not to stay long in the warrior class. These Ogres eventually

become Shamans or Shadow Knights. But, as many a smushed opponent has learned,

having a true Ogre Warrior on your side in a fight can often mean the difference

between being victorious and being dinner!</font>

The Ogre Shaman</font></a></u> </b><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><a href="../ogre.html#top"><br>
<br>
</a>Most Ogre shamans are slightly smaller and slightly smarter

than their warrior and shadow knight brothers. Despite being slightly smaller,

they are still a powerful force to contend with because of their magic

(&quot;mojo&quot;) use. As children Ogres who become shamans are picked on by their

larger brethren for being smaller and smarter than most. So, they tend

to be a bit solitary and bad tempered. However, as they grow older they

often form close bonds with other Ogres and Trolls who appreciate their

mojo abilities. Some have even been known to befriend dark elves, if only

because they don't taste good and are fun to tease.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0">Ogre Shamans are often seen slightly behind the battle

lines muttering mojo words and making sparkly lights to smite their foes

and strengthen their kin and allies. Being Ogres, they still occasionally

go berserk, forget to use their mojo, and run headlong into battle at the

side of the warriors.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0">Because of their faith and the strength of their god the

mighty Cazic-Thule, Ogre Shamans can at times be almost as effective in

melee as their larger kin. But when the berserker rage is over, they have to pray to regain their strength. The strong

religious faith shamans possess also makes these Ogres even more superstitious

than most, and is responsible for the many odd rituals which they tend

to keep secret from the other Ogres.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0">As with the religious types of many races Ogre Shamans

are fond of drinkee and are well known as the best brewers among the dark

races.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0">While they enjoy the hedbutt game, Ogre Shamans prefer

the slightly more cerebral sport of dwarf tossing. It's an exciting sport,

although at times the contestants get a bit too excited and eat the dwarves.

At this point, whoever eats the most dwarves is declared the winner.</font>
