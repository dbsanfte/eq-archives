Rhag2 is not a difficult mob to kill at all but the simple fact of it is that because there is only one mob that drops the spell the mob is constantly camped.</P><P>As Dornette said this is a idiotic design element but VI.</P><P>Why VI does really stupid garbage like that is beyond me. There is already far to much contention for the high end mobs without VI adding to the queue of people trying to get a spell they actually need in order to fulfill their duty.</P><P>I have witnessed races between high end guilds for these special mobs more times than I care to remember. The "races" do not lead to friendly competition they lead to backbiting and complete and utter b/s as the guilds actively do their best to ensure that they get the mob in question.</P><P>Does this make the **GAME** more enjoyable to play? Not for me. I play EQ becuase it is an interactive game. I do not play on a PvP server as PvP has absolutely no attraction for me. I thourougly dislike "design elements" that reduce the enjoyability of the **GAME**. One such design element is creating artificial contention for rare drops by restricting the drop to a single mob with a long repop time.</P><P>As to the group aego and group C3. Verant have stated numerous times that they favor clerics and enchanters. These spells are "necessary for the high end game to reduce downtime". So they are common drops. That is so blatantly unfair it is not even funny.</P><P>Regarding the drop rate of Funeral Pyre. An incredibly talented guild on Luclin has killed Rhag2 15 times, Funeral Pyre has dropped 3 times for them. Do the math and you will see how long it will be before the majority of high end necros ever see this spell.</P><P>Yet people always assume that our DPS includes FP. Face facts:-</P><P>1/ there are very few people with FP.<BR>2/ the resist rates on our spells are way higher than for any other class, I get really pissed off when, as a level 60 necro, I can't land a Pyrocuror on a high end "fire susceptible mob" yet a level 50 magician's fire based nukes all hit. I can't land Splurt on a mob, yet the enchanter equivalent POS dot lands with no trouble at all.</P><P>I guess we as necros should be thankful that at least the totally insane agro our spells cause has been reduced somewhat (Ouch did I just ask VI for a retro nerf by mentioning that?).</P><P>But you know what? I'm not grateful at all. Our class has been treated like crap by VI. They constantly nerf us and almost never give us anything to improve or bring our class back into line with the the other caster classes. VI slaps us in the face by totally ignoring the major issue with our class, dot stacking, and then goes back to "balancing clerics".</P><P>I am a fair person.

How about the fact that these mobs drops spells for several different classes? Perhaps every time they die they should drop three of every spell for every class whose spell they drop??

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> The problem i have with Funeral Pyre only dropping off Rhag2 is this:</P><P>If you are in a guild that is capable of killing High Priest, Arch Lich, Cursed and Emperor, then there is very little priority to go after Rhag2.  Sure, Rhag2 can drop GRC and other useful spells that your guild will want and NEED for fights in Luclin, but none of his other loots are worthy of putting something like Cursed or Creator on the backburner.  And furthermore, GRC drops off of lots of other mobs that DO take a higher priority for guilds like the ones i am describing.</P><P>So, for someone like myself who is in a guild capable of killing all the above mentioned mobs, yet still has not had more than 2 opportunities to even kill Rhag2 since Luclin was released, what am i to do?  Rhag1 and Rhag2 are killed regularly by other guilds on my server as well, its not like they just sit there waiting for my guild to be done killing Cursed and High Priest.</P><P>Basically i have pretty given up hope on getting Funeral Pyre.  The only way i will see it is on the rare time my guild is in Ssra, Rhag2 is up AND NOTHING ELSE AT ALL WORTHY OF KILLING IS UP ANYWHERE IN LUCLIN, AND i can convince everyone that we really do need to try to get yet another copy of GRC or some sh!t.  Because believe me, convincing them we need another copy of Funeral Pyre is not going to fly.</P><P>For Christ's sake, why can't they just make it so there is a teeny tiny bit of randomness to which mobs can drop these spells ( not just FP )???  Is someone gonna give birth because the Emperor drops Funeral Pyre instead of Uberwizziespell?  I think not.</P><P>I would really like to see these spells that are currently only dropping off of one specific boss mob in Luclin to be spread out over a wider range of boss mobs.  I feel this would even up the playing field for people in a large way, not making them any more accessible than they are now, not increasing their rate of entry into the world, just introducing a bit of randomness to their entry that does not exist at the moment.</P><P>Vtyn</P><P> </font></td>

EVERY caster class has to deal with the same thing in Luclin, you seem to be missing this point. Funeral Pyre is actually one of the more easily obtained spells. At least it doesn't drop off of Emperor Ssra like Garrison's Superior Sundering. ;) In any event, this spell drops fairly often; I'm sure you can find someone selling it at the very least. I believe we have several copies for sale on Veeshan.</P><P>Dead Men Floating and Gangrenous Touch of Zum`uul...who knows what the fuck Verant was thinking. I get the feeling there are fewer than 10 copies of each, serverwide. They're just disgustingly rare. IMO these should have been vendor spells. At the least they should be random drops of any mob in Chardok, not the rarest drop off a rare mob. Of course, if it came down to being able to obtain these spells or having dots stacking, class AA's reworked, pets upgraded...I'd be happy never seeing either of these spells. ;)</P><P>yeah</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=183135" target="_blank">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=183135</a></font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> No. Funeral Pyre is not fine. And.. No. I am not missing the point.  I am fully aware of the level of difficulty of the mob in question.  I am also fully aware that every caster class has a spell that drops off of only one Luclin boss type mob.</P><P>My points is:</P><P>Rhag2 is really a middle class type boss mob.  His loots do not lure a guild like mine to come slay him when he pops, in other words his loots suck ass for a guild that can kill the Emperor.  Once everyone in said guild has orbs for their VT key, who gives a care if the second or third necro on your roster is missing some spell that is only gonna help him/her solo better?</P><P>So, you might say, why not just buy the spell from one of the guilds that is attracted to kill Rhag2?  Forget about it, it does not happen on my server anymore. Nobody sells this spell, i have not even heard of one dropping in months, so do not try to tell me it is easy to get just because the mob is not hard to kill.  It is a very very rare spell.</P><P>Basically , i know of 3 necros on my server that have Funeral Pyre.  One has quit playing, so really only 2.  Of those 2, one is in my guild.  Now, since DoTs do not stack there is absolutely no reason on Earth or Norrath for my guild to make it any kind of priority to obtain another copy of Funeral Pyre, by any means.  I can count the number of raids in which myself and the other necro in my guild with FP have not both attended on one hand. He is always there, and so am I.  Nope, not missing Funeral Pyre today, next.</P><P>Every other 60 Necro on my server is running around in auction channel *WTB Funeral Pyre WTB, Paying way too much*.</P><P>My suggestion is to have Funeral Pyre, Marzin's Mark, Garrison's Superiour Sundering, etc. drop RANDOMLY off of the currently designated boss mobs that are dropping these spells.  This would make said spells actually obtainable by the multitudes of guilds.  In other words high end guilds would not have to sweep up the lower end boss mobs (Rhag2 and THO for example) in order to satisfy their caster ranks, and conversely lower and mid range guilds would not have suffer because they are unable to either a) have access to a given boss mob because uberguild_01 is actively trying to sweep up copies of &lt;insert your Luclin uber spell here&gt;.. or b) actually even seriously consider attempting something like Cursed or High Priest, lets face it those mobs ( and others that fit this category ) are just completely out of reach of many guilds, and always will be.</P><P>Now, you may say that perhaps those at VI never intended for any but the most elite of wizards to obtain Garrison's, and therefore nobody but the most elite of guilds should be able to obtain it for them.  For that one spell, perhaps the argument could hold.  It is an incredibly powerful spell, that is not hampered by any stacking restrictions.  But for the others, Funeral Pyre included, it is just rediculous the way they are entering the world at this time.</P><P>Now, as far as gDMF and Gangrenous Touch.. novelty spells. Nothing more than convenience and novelty.  Personally i want them and if i ever feel that i want them badly enough all i have to do is go to Chardok and camp the damn things. Simple as that. Hell, i am pretty sure that with enough practice and patience, i could find a way to solo the Korocust room. If any changes were to be made to these spells, the only ones that make any sense would be to possibly up the drop rate a hair, or make gDMF researchable.</P><P>&lt;Necro_01&gt;Look at me, I am lifetapping a mob that is immune to magic. &lt;Necro_02&gt;Yay for you, quit wasting mana and use your fire dots.</P><P>Vtyn<BR>Warlock<BR>Heaven and Earth</P><P> </font></td>

So saying that having too many copies of Funeral Pyre in game is going to unbalance anything is complete nonsense.  Mobs will die a little bit faster, perhaps.  I do not know of too many guilds that have even 1/4 as many necros as they do wizzies, do you?</P><P>Immudin- instead of just saying "oh my with too many necros casting funeral pyre the end game is going to be unbalanced and too easy", how about supporting your statement with facts?  I will tell you why not: You are wrong.</P><P>Funeral Pyre does a maximum of 2160 hit points over 54 seconds ( 9 ticks ) for a mana cost of 450.  The wizard spell Ice Spear of Solist does a maximum of 1200 hit points for 300 mana, with a 13 second recast delay and 3.5 second casting time.  Now, i am going to use Emperor Ssra as my example target mob ( since brainbite will not land on him, we will forget about that for now and assume the wizzy is NOT chain casting Ice Spear ).  </P><P>  &lt;Necro_01&gt; casts Funeral Pyre on Emperor<BR>at the same time..<BR>  &lt;Wizzy_01&gt; casts Ice Spear on Emperor (hits for full 3.5 sec later)</P><P>30 seconds later..<BR>  &lt;Wizzy_01&gt; ( who by this time has been idle for ~26.5 seconds) casts another Ice Spear on Emperor (again hitting for full)</P><P>Now.. 54 seconds after the Funeral Pyre hit ( and assuming mob was stationary and took full potential damage ) who has done more damage?</P><P>Wizard: 2400 hit points damage, 600 mana spent, total time: 33.5 seconds ( including 26.5 seconds of *idle time* to prevent over aggro ).</P><P>Necro: 2160 hit points of damage, 450 mana spent, total time 59.5 seconds ( including cast time ).</P><P>Then.. assuming the same wizzy takes another 26.5 second break and then recasts Ice Spear again..</P><P>Wizard: 3600 hit points damage, 900 mana spent, total time: 60 seconds</P><P>Necro: Is still probably recasting Funeral Pyre.</P><P>Emperor Ssra is a poor mob to use as an example.. if i choose another mob, one that the wizzy CAN cast Brainbite on, then that wizzy CAN chain cast Ice Spear ( at nearly 2x the rate i described above ).  The damage gets insane FAST.  Necros cannot keep up with that damage output, no matter what they are casting.  Don't get me wrong, this is not about competition between necros and wizzys, i am using this as example as to why the end game will not be unbalanced by multiple necros using Funeral Pyre on the same boss mob.</P><P>Now let us look at where each of these casters can obtain these example spells:</P><P>Wizard: gets his Ice Spear in Velious.. not a rare drop and drops RANDOMLY from numerous mobs of appropriately high level/risk, and is readily available on most open markets for purchase from a player entity.</P><P>Necro: gets his spell from ONE single mob in Luclin only, it is an incredibly rare drop, and is not available for purchase on 90% of servers.</P><P>Nobody is asking for this spell to grow on trees, I honestly do not see where you get that, Immudin.  All we want is a fair shot at getting a spell that is basically needed for our class, just like wizzys need their Ice Spear.  Leaving the spell drop tables in Luclin as they currently are means that 99% of all necros ( and many of those in guilds that are quite capable of taking down Rhag2 ) are never going to see this spell.  This is the fundamental error that i am attempting to address in this thread, and it applies to not only necros, but to every other casting class that has a spell that is currently only dropping off one mob in Luclin.</P><P>EDIT: Oh yeah, i almost forgot about Bane of Nife, the shaman dot from KUNARK. 1498 hit points damage over 42 seconds ( 7 ticks ), 425 mana cost, 5 sec cast time.  Drops off Juggernauts in Sebilis and other appropriately high level/risk mobs in KUNARK randomly.  This spell does amazing damage and is only level 56 /shrug.  Yet another example of the imbalance of the current Luclin spell drop tables.</P><P>Vtyn<BR>Warlock<BR>Heaven and Earth</P><P></P><P>Edited by - VtynofSaryrn on 07/22/2002  18:32:50</font></td>

I dont really see the point here.  Tanks and casters are invariably different and hence cannot be discussed in analagous terms.  Even a well-equipped tank does not have the soloing, and general utility options of a streamlined caster... let alone a jack-of-all-trades caster such as the necromancer.  If we were to make the statement that they dont have the right to get their one cookie when they level, they would be equally justified in saying that we should have to find a group to gain any exp.</P><P>Tanks and clerics dominate the raid game.  Chanters, clerics, and tanks dominate the single group hunting game.  We, and regrettably druids dominate the soloing game.  I cant make a real argument to say that we are balanced with the other class genres for raids..... other than being able to pull and do the FD rez trick I suppose... but that doesnt make up the difference........... yes, I would like to see us become more balanced...</P><P>As a final note... I do have to say that mindwrack, as it gives 300 mana to each party member once per minute (basicaly), does a lot to give us grouping credibility........ the ability to give an entire party flowing thought 30! is amazing..... its just a matter of training the myopicly snobish members of other classes about how effective it is.</P><P><BR>Ashnar Blackbone<BR>Warlock, Duckmaster<BR>Innoruuk</P><P> </font></td>
