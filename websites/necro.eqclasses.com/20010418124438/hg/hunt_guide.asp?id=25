First off...summon a GOOD pet.  I don't care if you have to spend 20 bone chips...you NEED it.  Start a good distance away and cast Engulfing Darkness then send in your pet.  If the darkness doesn't hold, don't recast just cast your heat blood.  After a couple of seconds, fear her.  This works most of the time even on deep reds.  Then to help out your pet, start sucking her dry.  If she comes for you, use what mana you have to heat her blood back up and hope you don't die..=)  This is where you use your knowledge...Don't be stupid and just sit there and take the blows or else you will die quickly.  She hits in the high 30's and at level 12, you can't take many of those...but once you get a pattern down...she is WELL worth the XP.<br><br>

I have been bugged about this spot for awhile now so I'll tell you.  It is NEVER camped and she always drops a Mandolin and upwards of 3 gold.  The mandolin can be sold for about 12 gold (depending on your charisma) and they weigh absolutely NOTHING. (0.0).  So grab some backpacks and bring a sack lunch with you and sit on her for a day.  Once my Necro hits level 12, I go and sit on her from the morning to the afternoon...one day I went from 12 to 16 in 8 hours of gameplay so she is WELL worth it.</td></tr><tr><td width='98' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma' size='2'>Author</td><td width='499' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma'size='2'><a href ='mailto:millena@mailandnews.com'>Millena</td></tr><tr></table><br><br><table border='0' width=611><tr><td width='100%' colspan='2' bgcolor='#21456B'><p align='left' style='word-spacing: 0; margin: 0'><b><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Additional Comments</font></b></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Saduja</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>I found that at level 12, Engulfing Darkness and Fear were not a good idea. They were resisted FAR too much. In fact, 6 out of 7 Fears were resisted. Here is what I did. If she is yellow, go ahead and try to pull with Engulfing and Fear. If this does not affect her, revert to "If she is red". Then Heat Blood and let the pet eat at her from behind. Throw in an occasional Lifetap. If she is red, DO NOT try to Fear or Engulfing Darkness her. Just Leach her to pull, Heat Blood her, and use the level 12 Lifetap on her. Yes, it is mana intensive. Yes, you will probably have to jump in and share damage with your pet. But she is about a 7 minute spawn, more than enough time to fully recover. After switching to this, she was very easy for a deep red.</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Qawee</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>I have been hunting Misty Storyswapper my last two game days.  This is usually once a week (when the ball on the other side of my chain lets me). Well anyway, Fear and Engulfing Darkness I found were vitally useless. More proof that Necros's have been give the keys to the corvette but have yet to drive it because its on cinder blocks.  Continuing on, I pull her buy heating the Sexy broads blood.  I send in my pet to check her out.  To see if she is worth my slaying.  Then I start hitting her with Lifedraw.  Usually she starts heading for me so I back peddle.  As I am running backwards I see her life just slip away. For added measure I keep Lifetap available when my mana is low to help finish her off.  I also keep Shadow Step available in times of desperation.  Sometimes she gets the best of me.  So far thet's only been 1 in 12 kills.  She ranged between yellow and red.  Remember I am only level 12 so I imagine it gets easier as you climb the ladder.  Which Misty greatly accelerates.  Oh by the way, bring lots of backpacks for all the wonderful mandolins you get.  I'm thinking of opening a Mandolin outlet on the Prexus server (MistysMandolins.com). Watch for initial IPO soon.  One last thing, give your pet a good weapon so he can put a beating on her. Farewell my brothers and sister of the Dark Dimension.</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Gnuggalumpus</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>I have hunted Misty now for far longer than I care to admit. When you are a level 12 hunting Misty, don't even think about casting fear or darkness. The thing to remember is that when she cons red, and you are a mighty bright green level 12, a failed darkness spell can basically screw you for the entire battle since heat blood gobbles up so much mana (and is indispensable). Even if darkness fails only 1 out of 3 times, that is one battle you stand a very good chance of losing. Also, fear is just a little too unstable for my taste. First, the spell has to take hold and then it has to take hold long enough to make any kind of difference. The few times fear actually worked on her, she took a few steps in panic before returning to me quickly with renewed fury.<br><br>

When I was 12, I did the following. I walked out far enough so that I could cast spells on her. I then sent my pet even further back. I hit ole Misty with HB and then ran like hell passed my pet. I had the pet suitably distanced so that once she was really closing in on me, he stepped in and interrupted her pursuit. Even though pets may not be able to continually taunt a critter, the first attack always seems to work and further serves to slow critter down for a few more valuable seconds (heat blood!). I then fire off leach, poison, and weaken (!) one right after the other and close in to fight (very important note: I had a runed totem staff but with no armor to speak of).<br><br>

I have no idea how much poison and weaken contributes, but I always use them (as a matter of good taste) and I never died to a red Misty at 12. My pet rarely died. It is certainly possibly I would have defeated her without them, but they are just too much fun to use. Also, weaken is a perfect timer for when she will spawn next. As soon as your stolen strength disappears, she pops up.<br><br>

Once you get past 13 (and especially in the later levels), this bard is extremely easy. When I hit level 14, I used engulfing darkness as a pull, but it was more out of boredom than anything else.<br><br>

One final point: I use strafing a lot in EQ. I have no idea how much difference this makes (if any at all), but I circle strafed Misty quite a bit which, combined with my pets attacks and taunts, seemed to freak her out a bit, making her constantly jump around and change directions. Again, this could have ZERO to do with my success with Misty, but you might want to experiment on your own.</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Fleshpealer</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>After reading your info on this NPC I figured I would give her a whirl.  I am a level 13 necro and was a brand new 13 without any real exp padding when I made my first attempt at her. Well she got the best of me on the first go around.  But still 13 and (getting closer to 12 I decided to push on).<br><br>

I gathered my Wits set up my pet and spells in perfect order then the hunt was on.  First I drew strength off good old Brother Estele, and then killed him off to the side...lol.  With him out of the way I could attack her without anyone else jumping in, though I found out later on he will not jump in (he was as green as an apple to me).  I too found out that engulf darkness only worked on her (for me) about 3 times.  Most of the time a set my pet up on the hill and I drew her (Red, yellow, white or black) with leach.  As she came running I was able to get off a Heat blood before she caught up to me and I sicked the pet on her.  While he distracted her I was able to get off a poison bolt.  Then (this is something I always do), I would heal my pet if he got down to half, this was in between slowly back peddling away from her to draw her away from pounding on him too much and giving him a chance to slash her good.  Sickle was my pet weapon of choice.<br><br>

Well 16 kills later, I was about 1 bubble till 14.  So 16 kills and 3 deaths were not too bad at all.<br><br>

NOTE: The 2nd time I died was at least a learning experience.  Let me explain.  She was red and down to maybe 10% but my mend bones fizzled and he dropped dead, and that was all she wrote I could not get another spell off while she pounded me from full health down to nothing.  But I was bound on the hill, so I figured as soon as I return I will mem (some choice spells and get her while she was still weak).  Not a great plan.  I ran to my body grabbed a few things made a pet and went after her. She was still as weak as a kitten but when I hit her with Heat blood her HP jumped up to more the 3/4 and the fight was on.  Needless to say that was death number 3.  But all in all, great XP getter and I plan to visit her again tonight.</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Grubin Trollfud</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Although not a necro, I use this site a lot to find places to hunt for my mage.  I started killing her at level 12.  Not much of a problem.  A few close calls, but I didn't die at all in level 12.  Now, I am half way through level 13, and have died twice.  It seems to be due to weak pets.  Although some are a level higher or lower than others, they all con blue to me.  I have started paying players to con my pets, because you WILL need your strongest pet to take her on.  She can be very tough.<br><br>

Oh, bind yourself close to the Qeynos Hills zone so you can gate there and create another pet by the time Misty gets to you, or zone if you don't have the mana you need.<br><br>

Anyhow, its just something to think about.  Good luck, my evil counter parts.</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Aegean</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>I started hunting Misty at level 12 thanks to the posts on this board.  The first time it did not go very well, but once I established a pattern it was extremely easy.  I went from level 12 to 15 in one day at this spawn.<br><br>
  
Here is how I did it.  Turn off Pets Taunts.  Pull with Heat Blood and run back to top of hill.  Send Pet in.  Cast Leach.  Back up a couple steps if she getting close and cast Heat Blood again.  Run along hill a few more steps to keep her away from you and cast Leach again.<br><br>
 
Then charge because if you dont your pet is going to die soon.  So take some hits and try to lifedraw.  At level 12 you have no mana left for lifedraw..so just cast poison or something and swing your staff at her.  You will likely win.</font></td></tr></table></td></table></div>
