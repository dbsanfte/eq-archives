They were accrediting more hate to pets than they should have. <BR>We also fixed a bug with factions that was making it impossible to raise some factions. There may still be factions that you can't raise because there are no methods for raising them, not because of a bug. If you get a faction message you will also get a faction gain (or hit). <BR>We also added a message that will let you know when you can no longer gain or lose faction with a certain group. It will say: <BR><i>Your faction standing with could not possibly get any worse. </i><BR>or <BR><i>Your faction standing with could not possibly get any better. </i><BR><BR>That was the essence of the patch last night. Sorry about the problems. <BR>Alan <BR> <BR><b><i>Well.. Hopefully I can finally raise my faction with NFP!  I hope the orcs in WC/EC were on that bug list, because I've been trying FOREVER to raise my NFP faction!</b></i><br></p></td><tr><tr><td background="img/purpback.gif"><img src="img/purpback.gif" width=1 height=10></td>
