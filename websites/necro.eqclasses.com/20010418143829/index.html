This means that some food items will not sustain a character as long as others, and some items will sustain your character longer than they did before. <BR><BR>** Bug Fixes ** <BR><BR>- We THINK we've fixed the problem with the Dusty Werebat. This fellow has been steadfastly refusing to appear where and when we ask him to. We've worked out a deal with his agent, and we think he'll be back to work with this patch. <BR><BR>- Corrected an anomaly with hit point bars that occurred when a character was healed or damaged by spells. This could be seen, for example, when a character was healed and the hit point bar would go up and then quickly go back down a bit right afterwards. There was no error in the assignment of healing or damage previously, just in the way it was being displayed. <BR><BR>- Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different bracer graphic than you would. Now everyone (including the wearer) will always see the same bracer texture. If you have two bracers that have a different look (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make sure that the one you want to show up graphically is on your right wrist inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will choose to show for you (unless you take off the left one and put it back on, which will show the left one, but that is only temporary, and it will go back to showing the right one after you zone or reenter the game). <BR><BR>- Fixed zoning problem in Nurga to Droga that caused characters to be facing the wrong way when they zoned, often causing confusion that lead to accidentally zoning back the way they had come. You should be facing the right way when you make that zone transition now. <BR><BR>** Zone and Quest Changes ** <BR><BR>- The marauding Tar Goos will no longer be assisted by the Geonids. This should make at least one quest more available. <BR><BR>- Grobb should now have a couple of ovens. Hopefully this will allow Troll bakers to keep their fellows full of carbs and ready to fight. <BR><BR>- Fixed a bug that occurred when selling stacks of items. Previously, if you had 4 bat wings and sold them one by one to the merchant, the merchant would have 4 bat wings for you to buy, but if you sold all four at once to the merchant he would only have one for you to buy. Now he will have 4 in either case. <BR><BR>- We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal remains. Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be dropping items for those epic quests. Hopefully these changes will dramatically reduce the competition and resentment over this spawn. <BR><BR>- We have reduced resistances to some spell types on some NPCs in Sky Shrine and the Tower of Frozen Shadow. This is the beginning of our overview of the resistances of NPCs in Velious. <BR><BR>** Improved and New Features ** <BR><BR>- When you /consent someone it will give them the ability to drag all of your corpses. <BR><BR>- You can now buy stacks of combinable items (such as rations, water, etc...) from merchants. It works the same way as sell in that you can hold down shift to buy a full stack and control to buy just one item. <BR><BR>- Added the ability to change the color of all windows at one time with /wincolor (all windows that can be changed, that is). You can now use /wincolor ALL 0 0 100 2, for example, instead of having to set each window separately. <BR><BR>- Right-clicking items while looting will 'auto-equip' them. This will work just as if you had picked the items up and dropped them onto the 'auto-equip' area of your character profile. So if there is already a piece of equipment on your character in the spot where the looted item would normally go, it will drop into your inventory, if you have room for it. <BR><BR>- The tab key will no longer toggle between you and your last target when the chat bar is up. When the chat bar is open the tab key will take you through the list of your most recent /tell names or /reply names. When the chat bar is closed the tab key will switch you between yourself and your last target. <BR><BR>- /assist has an added parameter. /assist on and /assist off will determine whether or not your character auto-attacks when you use /assist. So if you type /assist off, from that time forward using /assist will NOT engage your character's auto-attack. This change will be persistent, so it will remain as you left it when you log out. /assist also now has a range of 200 feet. <BR><BR>- The destroy confirmation requestor now shows the name of the item you are trying to destroy, or it just says money if you are destroying coins. This should greatly reduce the chance of accidentally deleting the wrong item. PLEASE read the text in the destroy confirmation box to be certain that you are destroying the right item before choosing to destroy it. <BR><BR>- Hailing Player Character will now say 'Hail Playername', rather than just 'hail'. <BR><BR>- Added /charinfo command. Currently this command only reports the zone where the current character is bound. We may add further information as things progress. <BR><BR>- You will now see how much damage your character has taken when he is hit by a spell that causes instant damage (DOT damage is not reported). <BR><BR>** Item Changes ** <BR><BR>- We've made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of the problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the two one-handed weapons. What will happen now is rather simple. The very next time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them apart), the old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace it. <BR><BR>THE NEW SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than in your inventory. So once you have combined them, make sure to place them in your inventory. And don't panic, the items didn't disappear. <img border=0 src="/newstrax/img/Happy_Face.gif" alt="Smile Fool!"> But also MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR ALL THREE ITEMS (the two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and needs to be able to fit into your main inventory). If you end up with a No-Drop container on your cursor with no place to put it in your inventory, you will have a problem... <BR><BR>Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged. Right now you won't be able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once after it is created. We're working on fixing that bug. We decided to make this change even with this small bug to help relieve everyone of the problems with the old scabbard. <BR><BR>This new scabbard will have a special ability. It will be able to recreate the epic weapons if you have lost them. Simply place a Sword of Runes (summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and hit the combine button. The scabbard will convert the temporary power of the Sword of Runes into the permanent epic sword. <BR><BR>Customer Service WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new ones. That will be done by the game itself once you have completed the quest and combined the swords for the first time. <BR><BR>- Changed the size of the Weighted Axe from Tiny to Large (after all, it's a big two-handed axe...). If you have one in a bag now, be aware that it probably won't fit back into that bag again once you take it out. <BR><BR>- No Rent Items will no longer be immediately deleted from your character inventory upon disconnection with the server. If you are disconnected from the servers, or even if you log out, your No Rent items (such as summoned food and water) will remain on your character as long as you log back to that character within 30 minutes. After thirty minutes those No Rent items will be deleted. There may be some extreme cases beyond our control (such as hardware failures) where No Rent items will not be on your character even if you log back in within the 30 minute timeframe. No reimbursement will be given for No Rent items lost in this manner. <BR><BR>- Grand Master Wrist Wraps have been fixed and should now create the "Pouch of Quellios" as intended. If you have one of these items and it still does not work, please contact a GM using /petition and ask them to switch yours for a new one. <BR><BR>- Snow Storm Mask should now function properly. <BR><BR>- The Ring of the Frozen Flame should now be working properly. <BR><BR>- The slow effect on the Willsapper proc has been reduced. <BR><BR>- The weight of Skewers has been increase to a weight of 3. <BR><BR>- Velious Monk armor appearances have been changed. If you're wearing these items, you probably already noticed this, but we thought we'd announce it anyway. New textures will be showing on the Plane of Growth dropped armors and on the questable armors. Because the Velious textures can be a strain on some systems, the textures for these new armors will not be loaded by default by the game. If you want to see the new textures you will have to edit your EQClient.ini and change the line LoadArmor23=FALSE (the default) to LoadArmor23=TRUE. <BR><BR>** Trade Skill Changes ** <BR><BR>- Bards that worship Sol Ro will now be able to wear the Imbued jewelry made for their god. For those that not only sing around the campfire, but sing about the campfire! <BR><BR>- 'World' Trade Containers (those that are stationary) have been fixed. Previously when a character tried to combine items in a world container that did not match a recipe, the items would seem to disappear. But if the character closed and reopened the container, the items were still in it. Those items should no longer seem to disappear. <BR><BR>- The speed of Selo's Song of Travel, the effect of the Singing Steel Chestplate has been increased a little. <BR><BR>** Spell Changes ** <BR><BR>- Removed Gem component from the following spells. They will now only require the metal components. These are the Enchant spells for making cultural armor. <BR><BR>Enchant Velium <BR>Enchant Mithril <BR>Enchant Adamantite <BR>Enchant Steel <BR>Enchant Brellium <BR><BR>- Changed the spell component for the following Magician spells from Lapis Lazuli to Malachite. They now use the same reagent as every other Magician pet spell. <BR><BR>Minor Summoning: Earth <BR>Minor Summoning: Water <BR>Minor Summoning: Fire <BR>Minor Summoning: Air <BR>Elemental: Earth <BR>Elemental: Water <BR>Elemental: Fire <BR>Elemental: Air <BR><BR>- Added Casting Text to the Following spells (the messages in brackets will now appear upon a successful use of the spell): <BR><BR>Panic Animal (soandso flees in a state of total panic!) <BR>Terrorize Animal (soandso runs away in terror!) <BR>Repulse Animal (soandso is utterly repulsed!) <BR>Acumen (soandso's eyes tingle) <BR><BR>- Cannibalize IV now exists. This spell is now available in Velious. <BR><BR>- Cannibalize II and III have had their effects improved. They now return more mana to the caster than they did before. <BR><BR>** Class Specific Changes ** <BR><BR>- Monk weight allowance has been increased. Every 15 levels monks will get an extra 1 stone weight allowance. The post 50 weight allowance has also been increased by 2 stone. <BR><BR>Level 15, Limit 15 <BR>Level 30, Limit 16 <BR>Level 45, Limit 17 <BR>Level 51, Limit 18 <BR>Level 55, Limit 20 <BR>Level 60, Limit 24 <BR><BR>- Disarmed traps will remain disarmed for a somewhat longer time than before to allow larger groups to get past the traps before they go off. <BR></b></p><a href="mailto:eqmurr@crosswinds.net?subject=Article#Patching the night away"><font color=#C0c0c0 face=Tahoma size=1><b>- Nark</b></a></td></tr><BR></table>

I've popped by with a bit o news for you all.<BR><BR>In Development:<BR><BR>We're finally starting to get back on a regular biweekly patch schedule. Here are the things we are currently working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:<BR><BR>Loot rules in the Warrens: We plan to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be eliminating several ways around the current "Trivial Combat Code" as well as looking at the problem of "spell twinking" in regards to the loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.<BR><BR><BR>Stonebrunt Mountains: The next "free" zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.<BR><BR><BR>Dungeon Touchups/Revamps: We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.<BR><BR><BR>Big Changes Planned for PvP: We've had a number of meetings lately to plan changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually be going up are still to be announced.<BR><BR><BR>Continued UI Enhancements: A number of things are planned, from allowing people the ability to buy stacks of items at one time, to improving the way things look on the screen.<BR><BR><BR>3D Engine Enhancements: One of the first things up is the enhancement of the engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the "moving stair step" visual artifact that you see in distant places where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance will be greatly improved. Update: This is actually now implemented however is not yet bug- free. You can take a look at the new capabilities by setting VideoModeBitsPerPixel=32 in your EQClient.ini. Note: If your card doesn't support 32 bits per pixel, you will probably crash. Also, your Deity Specific Quests: We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works.<BR><BR><BR>The History Unfolds: Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history and the future of the world will be made known.<BR><BR><BR>Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants: We're going to continue adding more quests and flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races' territories.<BR><BR><BR>New NPC Return Policy: Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the "Thank You!" message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<BR><BR><BR>Class Balance Discussions: Some recent changes have been introduced as a result of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback as we see fit.<BR><BR><BR>Velious Magic Resistance: In an effort to further balance the SoV expansion, we're taking another look at the unnaturally high magic resistance of Velious mobs. We'll evaluate this on a zone by zone basis and make changes to better balance out the risk vs. reward in the zones for both melee and caster player characters. <BR>We'll fire off more updates as we have information available for release. Until then, enjoy EQ!<BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team<BR></b></p><a href="mailto:eqmurr@crosswinds.net?subject=Article#A break from college"><font color=#C0c0c0 face=Tahoma size=1><b>- Nark</b></a></td></tr><BR></table>

After a fair amount of concern from players, we have removed the summon food and water effects from these items.  They have been replaced with modified versions of Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling Screech (greaves). <BR><BR>- The Incandescent Bracer can now be worn on the wrist rather than the waist. <BR><BR>- The Incarnadine Breastplate must now be worn to activate. <BR><BR>- Changed spell effects on Pauldrons of the Fearsome and Fearsome Shield to right click and worn to activate. <BR><BR><BR>*Bug Fixes* <BR><BR>- Fixed a bug that was causing some players to zone into the Warrens at the wrong location. <BR><BR>- Corrected an error with the Bixie Sword Blade, changing its delay from 6 to 16. <BR><BR>- Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were unable to Feign Death after Foraging. <BR><BR>- Kodiaks in the Great Divide are now seen as animals. <BR><BR>- Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison vendor, will now sell to characters even when he is away from his home. <BR><BR><BR>*Enhancements* <BR><BR>- Fixed a problem that occurred when players mistyped /guild.  Typing /guildd in the chat window is the shortcut for typing /guilddelete.  /guildd now has a confirmation box so that such an error should no longer lead to the accidental deletion of a guild. <BR><BR>- Added /showspelleffects.  Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player can turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells.  This will only affect spells, not world effects like waterfalls or weapon particle effects.  This should allow you to turn off many of the effects that hamper rendering performance, inducing effects of spells, while still being able to see some of the awesome effects, like those on certain paladin weapons... <BR><BR>- Added server-side filtering for chat and combat messages.  This will allow you to turn off guild chat, shouts, auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 'others misses', 'others hits', 'attacker misses me', PC spells (all options), NPC spells and Bard songs (all options) at the server instead of at the client.  This can reduce that amount of data sent to you over your connection, and can help those with slower connections with better performance and connectivity. <BR><BR>- Ships will now be announcing their arrival in most zones.  They will also be announcing their progress to any zone they travel through.  Any of those zones that they are not currently making announcements in will be added in the next patch or two. <BR><BR>- Shift - Left and Shift - Right will now repeat in the chat window.  This means that when editing what you've typed, you can just hold down the Shift and Left Arrow keys and the cursor will move left until it reaches the beginning of the line or until you release the keys. <BR><BR>- The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name when you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method. <BR><BR>- View perspective in wolf form has been fixed.  First-person view will now be on level with the wolf, rather than a few feet above it.  At the same time, perceiving other players in wolf form will appear to be standing on the ground instead of floating a few feet above it. <BR><BR>- Trade skill success and failure messages will be sent to the craftsperson's group instead of just the craftsperson, as long as the craftsperson is using the proper ingredients.  Failure of the craftsman to use the proper ingredients will result in no failure message being sent. <BR><BR>- In order to prevent a few trade scams, money can no longer be removed from a trade window.  You will have to cancel the trade and start over to adjust the amount of money involved in the trade. <BR><BR>- We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage spells no matter how far away they are when the spell lands.  This will allow those casters that try to stand as far back as possible to get updates even when their range indicates that the messages should be surpressed. <BR><BR>*Quest* <BR><BR>Several new quests have been added as well, so don't be afraid to talk to the folks of Norrath, they might have new information for you. <BR><BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team </b></p><a href="mailto:Lifebane@telocity.com?subject=Article#Patch Day"><font color=#C0c0c0 face=Tahoma size=1><b>- Lifebane</b></a></td></tr><BR></table>
