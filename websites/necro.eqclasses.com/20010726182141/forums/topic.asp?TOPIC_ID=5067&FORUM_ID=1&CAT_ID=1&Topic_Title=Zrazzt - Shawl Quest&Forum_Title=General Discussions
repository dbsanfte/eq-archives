        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><b>Shawl Quest #1</b></P><P>Go to Loremaster Borannin in Thurgadin and say "I seek to perform duties for the crown." or something like that. The Grand Historian next to him will tell you what to say to him if you hail him. Borannin will ask you to bring back to him four frost giant toes. Frost giant toes seem to drop randomly of all frost giants. Giving him the toes results in faction changes (+Coldain, +DainFrostreaverIV, -Kromzek, -Kromrif) and a Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl. He says to bring the shawl back to him in one months time and he will have more for you to do, so this is probably the start of a quest series.</P><P><b>Shawl Quest #2</b></P><P>This is the second Prayer Shawl Quest. You must first do the Frost Giant Toes Quest. </P><P>If you then ask What Tasks? the following conversation ensues: </P><P>You say, 'What task' </P><P>Loremaster Borannin says 'Every year the Dain replaces the trophies in his trophy room. There is a reward given for the best new trophy obtained. I intend to win this year and I will upgrade your prayer shawl for assisting me. Fill this box with ten Kromrif heads and bring me the combined contents along with the burlap shawl. I will submit the best one for the Dains consideration. </P><P>He then gives you a Preservationists Box. Fill the box with 10 Kromrif Heads and hit combine to make a box of Preserved Kromrif Heads. Then give Borannin Preserved Kromrif Heads box along with Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl. </P><P>Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Devastation. I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Before I forget, here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before long I will have yet another [chore] for you to complete. Be sure to keep checking. </P><P>Your faction standing with Coldain got better <BR>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <BR>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <BR>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <BR>You gain experience!! </P><P>You receive the Cloth Coldain Prayer shawl. </P><P>You can then proceed to the next chore.</P><P><b>Shawl Quest #3</b></P><P>This is the third Prayer Shaw Quest. You must do the first two before doing this. Ask Borannin "What chore?" and he will start you on the third quest. </P><P>Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Dyllwin . I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before I forget, the council has issued yet another [chore] for you to complete. <BR>Your faction standing with Coldain got better <BR>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <BR>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <BR>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <BR>You gain experience!! </P><P>You say, 'What chore?' </P><P>Loremaster Borannin says 'The council agrees that you have demonstrated a disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask that you demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving our people. Give this, my seal, to Mordrin. He will instruct you further. </P><P>Borannin tells you to go to Mordrin, but that is a typo, he really means Mordin, the guy in the butcher shop. </P><P>You say, 'hail Mordin Frostcleaver' </P><P>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Ah, hello there, and welcome to me shop, Halfling. Ye'll have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here lately. . . HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a selection of some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious. In addition to supplyin' the freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to would-be hunters in the wastes. </P><P>I gave Mordin Borannin's seal and he said the following. </P><P>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hullo Dyllwin , I see you've signed on for a bit of food service eh? Well we can always use an extra pair a hands here dat's fer sure. First things first, warsh yer grubby mitts an cook up dinner fer good ol Leif. Shouldn be too tough fer ye, he has simple enough taste. Make him a Tundrabear sandwich an lemme know when he's been fed. Dontcha ferget ta give him this with his meal. <BR>Your faction standing with Coldain got better <BR>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <BR>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <BR>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <BR>You gain experience!! </P><P>He gives you a napkin named "Leif's Napkin" is No Drop. </P><P>You say, 'What is a Tundrabear Sandwich?' </P><P>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Dat's easy, ye just take a slab a dat Tundra Kodiak meat and a jug a sauce, put it in da oven, den combine the product with a loaf a bread in a mixin bowl an there ye be. </P><P>Get a Tundra Kodiak meat, put it in oven with sauce and make "Saucy Kodiak Meat" (name?). Put your creation in a mixing bowl with one loaf of bread, which Mordin sells, and combine. If your skill is high enough you get the sandwich. Turn this in to Guard Leif with the napkin and get a "Used Napkin" back. It is also No Drop. </P><P>Give the used napkin to Mordin and get the next part of the quest. He needs you to make some Snow Bunny Stew for Trita Coldheart (name?). You get "Trita's Napkin" (No Drop). </P><P>You say, 'What is Snow Bunny Stew' </P><P>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa Bunny meat and a jug a sauces. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks a water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty! </P><P>The tough part here is finding a mixing bowl. I searched several cities including Thurgadin for a mixing bowl or even a mixing bowl sketch or mold. I finally found one in a shop in North Freeport near the bank. I don't recall the shop name though :( </P><P>Once you mix the ingredients in the bowl and get your "Saucy Rabbit"(name?) you put that, one spice, 2 flasks of water and a pot into the oven to make the stew. The pot can be made with the smithing skill, and maybe even pottery, although I hadn't worked on that at this point. </P><P>I gave the stew to Trita with the Napkin and received a dirty pot in return. I gave that back to Mordin and was given the next part of the quest. </P><P>Next you need to createan Ulthork Meat Pie for Brita. You receive Brita's napkin, No Drop. </P><P>You say, 'What is Ulthork Meat Pie?' </P><P>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been awhile since I made one. Here we are, two Ulthork meats, a vinegar and a spices in a mixin bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump a dough, an a pie tin in da oven an yer good ta go. </P><P>This requires 2 Ulthork meat, and the problem here is that if you're not careful you will eat the meat. Most of the items you need to collect or make are edible. I know the kodiak meat and bunny meat do not get eaten, but everything else seems to disappear if not below your food in your inventory. I could not find any snake eggs in Thurgadin for the clump of dough, so I ported to Misty Thicket to get them. The pie tin is another stumbling block here unless you are good at smithing and pottery, or you have a friend who is. To smith the Pie Tin you first need to make a ceramic lining, so your pottery has to be trained somewhat. I had relatively good success with a 25 pottery, whereas my smithing is in the low 100's and I don't think the pie tin is trivial to me yet. Luckily the pie tin, and the pot in the previous step, are regular items that anyone can craft and give to you if you lack the proper skills. </P><P>Turn the pie and the napkin in to Loremaster Brita in the back of the Library and receive a dirty pie tin which you take back to Mordin for the final step in this quest. </P><P>The final task is to create a Snow Griffin Souffle. The person you are making this for is none other than the Grand Historian Thoridain himself, so it has to be made well. I have worked my baking up to 115, and I don't remember the souffle being trivial to me. </P><P>You say, 'What is Snow Griffin Souffle?' </P><P>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four snow griffin eggs and a pack of spices in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's all gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it to Thoridain and if ye did it right he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl and he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen. </P><P>So now you need 4 Griffin eggs. I had never seen any drop up to this point, but I haven't killed alot of Griffs either. I set out and with a little help was able to get 4 eggs to drop in about 3 hours. It would have gone faster, but I had trouble finding the Griffins. All in all I'd say we got the 4 eggs in about 12 - 15 Griffins, maybe even less. </P><P>Once you've made the souffle turn it in to Grand Historian Thoridain with the napkin. Here I learned something useful. I forgot to turn in the napkin when I turned in the souffle. In my excitement in creating the souffle I had completely forgotten. I was about to petition that he had eaten my item when I realized the forgotten napkin, so I gave him the napkin and to my suprise it worked. </P><P>Grand Historian Thoridain says 'My compliments, Dyllwin , what a wonderful dish! Please accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May it give you power over your adversaries. <BR>Your faction standing with Coldain got better <BR>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <BR>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <BR>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <BR>You gain experience!! </P><P>He gives you his Seal to give to Borannin with your second Prayer Shawl. Now here is the toughest part of the quest. I looked at the Seal thinking it would be some no stat item, to my suprise I found it is an incredibly nice item, I think better than the Frozen Orb everyone is farming in the Eastern Wastes. Stats are AC 3, Wis +3, Int +3, SvCold +3, Sv Magic +3 and Mana +30. I hesitated for a moment, but finally turned it and my Prayer Shawl in to Borannin thinking I could do the quest again to that point to get the Seal. </P><P>Loremaster Borannin says 'Well done Dyllwin, the council will be impressed with your effort. Here is the woven prayer shawl, wear it with pride. I know there is talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask me what the council has [brewing]. <BR>Your faction standing with Coldain got better <BR>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <BR>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <BR>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <BR>You gain experience!! </P><P>This is the best part of the quest. I looked at my inventory to check out the stats on the shawl. It is as expected, one better on each stat over the second one, just like the ring quests. What shocked me, however, is that along with the third shawl I also received back from Borannin the Seal of Thoridain. So with this third quest we get two items. The shawl, which has not quite reached the level that I would switch it out for what I have on, and the Seal which is an incredible nice item. </P><P>He alludes to the fourth quest in this series, but when questioned about it says there will soon be much to do. </P><P>You say, 'What is brewing?' </P><P>Loremaster Borannin says 'As of now they have nothing for me to tell you. Bear with me Dyllwin , there will soon be much to do! </P><P>Unfortunately I did some of the quest on a different computer, so I did not have all of the log entries to include with the correct names of some items and what some of the NPC's say. All of the steps are here, anything missed is just dialog. </P><P>For those who want it sumed up, here is a shopping list of items you will need to do the whole quest. This assumes no failures, so plan accordingly :) </P><P>1 Tundra Kodiak Meat (Non-stackable) <BR>2 Jug of Sauces (Stackable) <BR>1 Loaf of Bread (Stackable) <BR>1 Mixing Bowl (Container) <BR>4 Snow Griffin Eggs (Stackable, No Drop) <BR>3 Spices (Stackable) <BR>2 Snow Bunny Meat (Non-stackable) <BR>2 Flasks of Water (Stackable) <BR>1 Pot (Non-stackable, Not a container) <BR>2 Ulthork Meat (Stackable, edible) <BR>1 Vinegar (Stackable) <BR>1 Snake Egg (Stackable) <BR>1 Bottle of Milk (Stackable) <BR>1 Cup Flower (Stackable) <BR>1 Pie Tin (Non-stackable, Not a container) </P><P>One last note...I did this whole third quest without an open inventory slot, since I had to carry around a mixing bowl. So you don't have to worry about not getting an item from one of the NPC's if all of your slots are filled, anything they give you, including the shawl and the seal, fit in your backpacks.</P><P><b>Shawl Quest #4</b></P><P>first, talk to loremaster borannin in the thurgadin library. say "what brewing?" (continued from the 3rd shawl).</P><P>You say, "What is brewing?"</P><P>Loremaster Borannin says, "Ahh yes good to see you again Clairan. I wish it were under better circumstances that we meet today. For some time now we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil on one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and had not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?"</P><P>You say "I will accept this mission."</P><P>Loremaster Borannin says "The council will be pleased to hear of your acceptance, Clairan. Scour the region surrounding the city of the Giants. Discover what happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell protect you."</P><P>now head to eastern wastes and the kael ramp. Tanik is a triggered spawn. the way to trigger him is to run up and down the kael ramp. (worked best for me when i ran zig zag). he spawns down towards the bottom of the ramp and is laying on the ground. </P><P>You say, "hail Tanik Greskil"<BR>Tanik Greskil says "Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly hurt and need your help."</P><P>You say, "i will help"<BR>Tanik Greskil says "Quickly, give me a vial of Veluim Vapors so I can return home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics."</P><P>You say, "what velium vapors"<BR>Tanik Greskil says "Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you? Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. I will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep from being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope."</P><P>so now you have to run back to thurgadin. Frundle can be found in one of the three buildings across from the paladin guild (near the library). </P><P>You say, "what velium vapors?"<BR>Frundle Frenkler says "Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret."</P><P>You say, "what velium vial?"<BR>Frundle Frenkler says "I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet."</P><P>she will give you a 4 slot purifier. it is a container, so you will need an open inventory slot.</P><P>now you need to collect your ingedients. go to CC. everything you need is there. hunt the miners up top for the small pieces and small bricks of velium. then drop (make sure you have lev!) down to the bottom, run through the dorf town, and into the hall with the velium crawlers, spiderlings, and webmasters. the spiderlings die in one nuke (688). the crawlers die in one nuke and one ES dot (688+300=around 1k HP). webmasters are tougher and i avoided them. in about an hour, i had a stack of these and gated out.</P><P>head back to thurgadin. go in the bank. the vendor on the very left sells crystal shards and HQ firing sheets. buy 2 crystal shards and 1 HQ firing sheet.</P><P>go click on the pottery wheel in the bank. put the items in like this:</P><P>crystalline silk<BR>crystalline silk<BR>crystalline silk<BR>glass shard<BR>glass shard<BR>small brick of velium</P><P>do not stack the silks. also, even though all other pottery i've done always requires a water flask, do not use one. i tried and it didn't combine. so NO WATER FLASK! i'm around 100 in pottery and it was not trivial.</P><P>you will get an unfired velious vial.</P><P>right next to the pottery wheel is the kiln. combine the vial you just made with a high quality firing sheet. this will produce a velious vial. it was trivial at 100.</P><P>now, open that purifier box that you got and put in the vial, and 2 small pieces of velium. make sure they are not stacked.</P><P>small piece of velium<BR>small piece of velium<BR>velious vial</P><P>hit combine and you will have a vial of velium vapors. this looks like it can be used by characters as well. it has one charge of "thurgadin gate" and apparently will gate you to thurgadin, although i didnt try.</P><P>now run back to eastern wastes and find tanik again. give him the vial of velium vapors and he will thank you and then poof, leaving you a note to deliver to loremaster borannin. go back to thurgadin and turn your woven shawl along with the note to loremaster borannin and you will get faction and your shawl will be updated.</P><P>:) good luck</P><P>P.S. WORDS OF WARNING! when trying to make tanik pop, there is a chance that instead of tanik, you will trigger the kromriff death squad. this is a group of very nasty giants that have high MR (even after my group debuffed him, i couldn't land a snare). they also run at nearly sow speed. if anyone has ever fought warden bruke in EW, it's like having a handful of him all spawning on you at once, except they have more HP and see through invis. our group (ranging from mid 40s to 50s) had trouble killing one. we finally succeeded and got a nice large class only woven vest (18 ac, 10 str and some other attributes). my friend had between 8-10 spawn on her at once. she got a message of "you have been giant ambushed" and they killed her in seconds. i took a screenshot of the dead one we killed if you need proof...but i don't lie. so be careful</P><P><b>Shawl Quest #5</b></P><P>You say,'How may i further advance my reputation?'</P><P>Loremaster Borannin says,'Auuar ! Thank Brell you're here. I was about to send one of my Lorekeepers looking for you. It appears that the information Tanik acquired is most perilous indeed. The Dain has called an emergency session of the council and i must attend. We dont have the luxury of waiting for an appropriate task to arise, you must advance as soon as possible. Unfortunatly, I have neither the time, nor the components to fashion the next few shawls for you.

Take this container and combine a glowing shardworm bile with three of the fibers to form a piece of glowing crystalline silk. Five pieces of glowing crystalline silk sewn to your fur-lined shawl will yield a beautiful silk shawl. Become a master in the art of tailoring before risking all you've worked for and be sure to let me inspect your work when it's complete.</P><P><b>Shawl Quest #6</b></P><P>You say, 'am i worthy?'<BR>Rexx Frostreaver says 'To ensure your worthiness you must continue to refine your prayer shawl.

It is a very demanding product and i can see from the look in your eyes that you desire to burn your sewing kit in our furnace, but if you persevere, your effors will be richly rewarded. When you are ready you must carefully weave a spool of sacred Coldain thread. Take the thread, this pattern, and the silk shawl and carefully embroider the pattern. The result will be most exquisite. Please show me if you manage to create one'</P><P>You say, 'What sacred coldain thread'</P><P>Betti Frostreaver says 'Take a woven frost giant beard, two sire's hairs, two manticore manes and two drakel dire wolf whiskers, and combine them in a sewing kit.
