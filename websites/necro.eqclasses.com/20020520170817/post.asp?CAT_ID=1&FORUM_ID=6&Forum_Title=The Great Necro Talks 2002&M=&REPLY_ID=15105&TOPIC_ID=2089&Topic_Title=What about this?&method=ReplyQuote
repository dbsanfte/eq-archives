ok i'm not going to get into the wizard comment, just leave it as saying you are wrong...atleast over long battles.

and i think you mean Lure not bane...banes only work against certain creatures.  lures are the ones with low resist, low agro, and high mana cost.  some lure DoTs would be VERY nice IMO, or if they put life taps back onto lure...

I hadnt quite thought of this along those lines. I agree with your points, but rather than thinking we need an upgrade to our dots or specialist Bane dots, you have made me think along another line.</P><P>I think your primary point is that with all of our DOTs loaded we generate so much aggro that we will definately be summoned and slaughtered. Possibly the issue here is with Aggro generation and that old hoary chestnut dot stacking.</P><P>If we could stack all of our dots and other necros could stack all of theirs and NOT get summoned, we are then once again damage dealers. To me the aggro generated from a spell as simple as EB is rediculous. Why is it that I can drop an EB on a MOB which is at 15% health, after its been Tash'd, Malo'd, cripple'd, Massively Nuked, backstabbed, beaten on by 30 tanks and then I get summoned?.</P><P>That to me makes absolutely NO sense at all. The aggro generation on our DOTs needs to be seriously re-examined.</P><P>I dont think we can seriously look at ourselves and our damage in comparison to any other class at all. Tanks etc are always going to do more dps than us because their damage is gear dependant and they can stand in front of a mob and smack away without the issues of mana/spell aggro/recast times etc etc.</P><P>However, we are a damage dealing class, we should be able to do a "decent" amount of damage to a MOB. I think we all agree that during a long fight we can do serious damage to a mob, but how many fights in raid encounters last longer than one minute?. What we are looking for I think is an ability to do damage during "short" fights. (IE Kael arena, NToV, rings of fire etc)</P><P>In these cases I think your suggestion of a high damage, short cast, short duration DOT is a good one and I agree that it would not make us overpowered as they are dots to be used in raid situations.</P><P>However I can see several issues arising from out of such an implementation.<BR>1. Aggro. If VI follows the "rules" they seem to have about aggro on our fast casting DOTs (CoC, EB etc) then the aggro generated after the casting of said DOTs would be a guaranteed death sentence. Aggro is something that needs to be examined in the greater scope of caster balancing.<BR>2. Placement of the spells. They will be placed on "uber" encounter MOBs that most of us will never see, therefore the DOTs will not be available to you and I and the whole problem remains static.</P><P>To this end is why I would rather see a short duration, medium damage DOT with low aggro, which could be placed on a vendor. Some thing like this:<BR>Level 55<BR>Vendor purchasable<BR>Expensive, say a 2k cost price.<BR>Venom of the Shissar<BR>Cast time: 5 sec<BR>Duration: 48 sec<BR>Damage: 2400<BR>Very Low aggro, marked to only work on Mobs 50+. Thats a DPS of 50/sec. On long (Uber encounter) fights this could be cast multiple times by the same Nec and would then be doing a reasonable but not ungodly amount of damage. The restriction to 50+ Mobs would mean the average Necro is not going to use this while soloing as not many of us would be hunting MOBs within 5 levels of ourselves at purchase time.</P><P>All I am trying to do is come up with something that VI is likely to swallow. If we suggest a spell with say 45sec duration and 4k damage I doubt we would ever see it. A spell like the above I believe would be more acceptable in terms of "caster Balancing" because we arent treading on the toes of wizzies/shammies etc in terms of DPS.</P><P>Another idea I would like to throw at you Dunkel is the issue of spell availabilty. Now I am going on memory here so bear with me if I get anything blatantly wrong.</P><P>VI has said that a lot of our spells are "bonus" spells, IE the non skelly illusion DD's/the mythical group DMF etc.<BR>They have, I believe, also claimed that a lot of casters resisted the ideas of taking research further and giving us the ability to research our higher level spells. Im not sure who resisted this as a lot of the suggestions posted on this board in the last caster balancing talks were along the lines of being able to research the 55+ spells again.</P><P>VI has also made concerned noises about Mudflation and the amount of PP available to players, particularly on the "elder" servers.</P><P>My idea is this, and I believe it would kill 2 birds with one stone. Basically put the 51+ dropped spells onto Vendors, even 1 particular Vendor in someplace like the bazaar. Make these spells REALLY expensive IE:<BR>51 500pp each<BR>52 750pp each<BR>up to 60 at 10K each for example.</P><P>This would mean that they would be taking PP out of the game, but the spells then become a lot more available to those of us who are unable for one reason or another, to regularly hunt in "uber" zones.</P><P>If it drops for you on a raid, good on you, you have saved yourself 10K. If it doesnt, you still have the ability to actually aquire those spells with some judicious hunting and saving/begging/borrowing etc. When I looked at the thread of Hi level necros still missing major spells at 60 like EOT and Pyre it made me mad.</P><P>And I see the spam in /trade for people selling those spells to desperate necros for 100K+, because noone wants a necro to go on a lot of those raids because we arent needed, because we cant get the spells which make us group friendly, because they are incredibly rare drops, off uber mobs that we dont get to hunt because noone wants us in a raid, we are in a Catch-22 situation.</P><P>Meanwhile the Tanks who have looted these spells take that 100K and go away and buy themselves uber_weapon_99 and uber_armor_99, they have increased their power 10 fold while the (now) poor necro has simply recieved a spell he/she should have in the first place. Like Tanks and weapons, without our spells we are nothing.</P><P>Sorry that devolved into a bit of a rant, but hopefully you have gotten the idea enough to make comments.</P><P>BTW:  <BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote>Ulaa, you are one really nice person.

A fast damage DOT like Ebolt/CoC with low aggro is exactly what I am talking about here. Most Necs dont ever use ebolt/CoC because of the aggro. When grouped, eithjer raiding or just grouping, dropping an Ebolt/CoC on a mob is a guaranteed way to grab and HOLD aggro from the MT. In a raid situation the Mob will not attack anyone else until you are dead and by then you have messed up the aggro rota and the whole raid dies. This is a quick way to never get invited to a raid again.</P><P>Ebolt and CoC are nice for soloing except for two major issues on both of them. The first issue is resistances. Both of them are highly resisted. Whats the point of casting a low mana high damage dot if you have to cast it twice to get it to stick. Suddenly the mana ratio looks like crap for that spell. With CoC one resist makes it a 500 mana for 1k damage. I find CoC/Ebolt are resisted 50% of the time at least so I dont use it anymore.</P><P>The second issue is really confined to Ebolt and its the DD component. By 55+ most Necs are almost exclusively root/dotting. The DD component of Ebolt makes this a useless spell because it will break root about 95% of the time, thats if it isnt resisted from the start.</P><P>So our two fastest damage DOTs (which are needed on raids) have Serious disadvantages for both soloing and grouping. I like both these spells and would really like to be able to use them a lot more. But for the above reasons I dont, they sit at the back of my spell book, and every now and again I look at them wistfully and forget them again.</P><P>The other Upgraded spell I would like to see is a 58-60 version of is Splurt. </P><P>This is one of the best spells VI has created for us and every Nec loves it. But at the time you start to get to around 58+ its really at the low end of the damage scale for the MOBs you are hunting.</P><P>Say a spell along the following lines at 58:<BR>350 Mana<BR>4 Sec cast time<BR>2500 damage over 2mins<BR>with the same sort of damage per tick increase ratio as splurt.</P><P>You would have to be VERY careful with stacking that one as with that spell and any other DOT on a mob, in a raid the final couple of ticks would definately get you summoned.</P><P>56 DE Necromancer<BR><br><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49001" target="_blank">Profile</a><BR><a href="http://sizzlesites.com/Ulaa/" target="_blank">Ulaa's web site</a><br><BR><img src="http://www.sizzlesites.com/Ulaa/sig.jpg" border=0></font></td>

When I read lines on this forum ,I really want to stop playing my 52 necro...</P><P>EQ has never been a balanced game ,but each time Verant want to balance it, it is to make it boring and never to make it more fun.</P><P>Necros, Mages and in a lesser way druid are becoming useless post 50 and you feel a bit "desperate" your class is a "mana battery" (never heard of such skills for necromancer in Heroic fantasy worlds before...probably VI was trying to find a way ti make us somewhat useful?) If VI want to make us useful post 50 without giving us a 30k/min DOT, I suggest: <BR>- A disease spell which makes uber-mobs likely to fail their spell-casting and/or innate abilities.</P><P>-A "special" buff spell kinda "soul revenge" you cast on someone, a spell which deals great amount of damage to whatever killed the  "buffed" character. It would be well suited in the "necro spirit". It would be great to see twenty characters going to sacrifice themselves in case of a nearly failed raid just to finish that uber mob :)</P><P>-Or be able to summon an avatar of Innoruk for 12 seconds by sacrificing a level 60 character (but this will never happen...I am realistic with VI sense of fun.</P><P>But I am hopeful , when EQ will drasticaly decrease in number of players, I am sure VI will think different about the fun of playing...</P><P>Tux 52 necro</font></td>

This was from the careful hoarding of practically everything I made in over fifty levels, barring the cost of buying spells and Jaspers!  (And was recently spent anyhow!

Maybe some other minor junk too.  *Grin*))  I'm pretty pleased with the rate at which I can make cash at level fifty-two, but this kinda cost would still hurt me.  <BR>Besides, it'd only drain the cash from casters.
