Amazingly, it has no negative drawbacks as to a necromancer's performance. Any drawbacks that may exist are purely within the realm of game balance, but these are largely mitigated by other circumstances.

As a side note, I could see where this would benefit mages far more, as they do not have the means to feign, harmshield, or heal themselves. I agree 100% with this change being made for mages due to their lack of the above abilities and any other pet caster due to the relative weakness of their pets.

Necromancers are somewhat different and I hold some reservations about this capability. No 'deal-breakers', but enough to warrant thought.

To start, our pets go from being weak in the early game (1-20), to powerful in the mid level game (20-44), to moderate in the high level game (45 to 60, group and solo), to very underpowered in the velious/luclin high level game to insignificant in the 'uber' game, to -- even hate and fear just don't compare, per mob. This is opinion based on personal experience. As such, it isn't a 'fact'. It's supposition. Conjecture. A 'feewing' (yes, with a w). I'm Level 55 presently. I break Velious and Luclin out as a step above the 'high level game' simply because they are. For instance, my 49 pet works well in the hole, KC, and HS -- average lifetime, 1 minute unhealed (just shy of a snare) -- my pet gets chewed up like a toy in SG, Kael, or Maidens Eye -- average lifetime, 15 seconds, if that. Uber encounters? The pets don't even matter. The problems caused by pathing, other mob aggro and mez breaks don't justify their nigh-insignificant damage output. There are exceptions for everything, of course and by no means am I pretending that these are 'hard' numbers. Maybe I'll get bored and sit down and log pet solo fights against each mob type in numerous zones and post them for analysis. Just as soon as I get that job that pays to play EQ, that is. A hard analysis of pets in that manner, however, is likely what is necessary to get them effectively rebalanced. Perhaps Verant is doing so now. Perhaps not. The world may never know.

How you perceive your pet will likely have to do with your tactics, how much you group and how much time you spend in dungeons. When fear kiting, all that matters is damage output and enough HP to live through your fear re-casts or until you get that wanderer rooted or Screaming Terror'd. In a dungeon, it's a different story entirely -- then stun, taunt, and damage absorbtion become far more important -- especially the latter at present (note that taunt doesn't work effectively if there is a PC within range at present, the pet taunts for a second or two, and the mob immediately switches to ANY pc within range who is on the hate list whatsoever instead of the pet). The effectiveness of the tactic largely depends on the number of mobs being fought, the damage output of these mobs (which can depend on slows, resists and to a far lesser extent, debuffs).

So, for fear kiting, will we honestly care about this change? No, not really. That's because the 'damage output' of the mob is zero, minus fear drops and ripostes (which are now less likely to hit pets, remember).For grouping? Well, maybe. Some will, some won't. A full group of 6 with a cleric, shaman, enchanter, and warrior? Hmm. Nope, not gonna care in the vast majority of fights. Would this periodically save your group? Sure. I can see it saving you in Kael Arena, the Hole, heck, anywhere where you need that extra 5 seconds of life that your pet might buy you (5-7 seconds is about all he'll buy you, there, with one mob -- add another, and cut the time in half and so on). Would it work as effectively at lower levels (1-44)? Sure, getting a pet out fast can often save the tank's bacon till the healer gets the heal off, or you get a heal out and go to work, personally. For those who might comment that the mana is always better spent doing damage, well, sure, sometimes. It depends on the encounter. If the mob has a sliver of health left, sure, nuke him. A dot certainly isn't go
ing to work in enough time if you're this desperate unless you're all running and counting on it to kill him as he's chasing you (at 66% percent effectiveness, remember).

The point is that the pet becomes a rune (damage absorbing spell), for those few seconds -- taking damage that would otherwise be taken by you, or a group member. If he dies, big deal -- think of him as a rune that finally ran out. The best thing about him is that he'll eat spells, too.

Personally, I'd make good use of this change, were it to happen. I typically fight with a group of 3, where the pet is a real aid in split tanking while I figure out what to do with the add. (Start casting ST, then type in /pet back off, land the command JUST before the spell lands -- it's amazing, if you don't do this, learn how now -- your enchanter will love you).

As is, a necromancer without a group capable of handling the encounter in the first place will have little chance to summon a pet. This is certainly not a hard rule, as I too have successfully feigned, loaded a summon, and managed to summon a pet to while 3+ mobs were beating on the party. But take into account that you use the recast time waiting for the bubble to come up, that you have to memorize the spell in the first place, and the cast time is going to leave you standing there while you wait for a pet of dubious value that may get interrupted mid-cast anyway.

Here's the various pet summons for necromancers, for comparison:

Cavorting Bones, L1, warrior - 5s cast, 15 mana, 4 recast.
Leering Corpse, L4, warrior - 6s cast, 40 mana, 9.5 recast.
Bone Walk, L8, warrior - 7s cast, 80 mana, 9.5 recast.
Convoke Shadow, L12, warrior - 8s cast, 120 mana, 11 recast.
Restless Bones, L16, warrior - 9s cast, 160 mana, 0 recast.
Animate Dead, L20, warrior - 10s cast, 200 mana, 0 recast.
Haunting Corpse - L24, warrior - 11s cast, 240 mana, 0 recast.
Summon Dead - L29, warrior - 12s cast, 290 mana, 0 recast.
Invoke Shadow - L34, warrior - 13s cast, 340 mana, 0 recast.
Malignant Dead - L39, warrior - 14s cast, 390 mana, 0 recast.
Cackling Bones - L44, warrior - 15s cast, 450 mana, 0 recast.
Invoke Death - L49, warrior - 16s cast, 490 mana, 0 recast.
Minion of Shadows - L53, rogue - 14s cast, 525 mana, 0 recast.
Servant of Bones - L56, monk - 15s cast, 525 mana, 0 recast.
Emissary of Thule - L59, warrior - 16s cast, 650 mana, 0 recast.

Noting the current cast times, even if a necromancer has the spell ready, he would have to lose aggro, or move significantly distant to have time to cast. You can see that we'd have to move a fair distance to manage that, as above. In a group situation, however, losing aggro is fairly easy to do, although not always the wisest course of action. I often maintain aggro so that others do not have to run in circles attempting to heal or mez, knowing that if it comes down to it, I have the best chance to lose aggro when it becomes critical for me to do so. It won't always work, but compared to an enchanter I've got nine lives.

Also, in a grouping situation where an enchanter is involved, often the mezzer will not want the pet engaged or loaded. If we have aggro, it's hard to chain spam the pet off of the mobs while a mezz lands while attempting to do anything else whatsoever. So this is somewhat self limiting in the normal game -- we'll be asked to leave the pet down rather than have him act as a single mob mezz while his HP hold out. Yes, I know the pet can do it while reducing the number of mobs
the enchanter has to worry about for a short time, but most mezzers have on thought in mind -- mez them all. Anything that isn't being mezzed, therefore, must be an error. It's a perception issue more than something that causes serious problems, but the few times it causes problems, the enchanter dies, so it tends to stick in their heads that it's bad, and for good reason. 

Assuming we can get the spell memorized (or have it memorized, knowing that this tactic will be employed), we could use our pet to take hits (especially against slowed mobs -- undead while solo, but with a partner or group who can slow, this becomes more useful) to allow us to break spawns, or as an emergency delaying tactic - 2 seconds of mob delay can be the difference between life and a long run back to your corpse, especially if you're snared or low on health and thus moving slow. Now note, and this is important -- Necromancer pets do not stand a chance at doing significant damage against mobs of equitable level to the necromancer. Compare with mage pets especially at high levels, and you'll see an even larger disparity.

Also note that summoning your pet does NOT mean he's buffed. You still have the crazy recast times on your pet buffs to worry about (no memming the spell mid-fight for you) and the cast times are pretty rough, too. No pet buff means that your pet is fighting an awful lot like a halfling ranger -- you're sure he's doing damage somewhere, but you're checking to see if you have others hits turned off just in case. This lack of pet buff is a very significant footnote in the pet summoning discussion -- as it means that your pet is only serving in his capacity as a 'rune', and not as a really good dot. What this means again, is that in the large majority of cases, you simply aren't going to increase your killing power by using a pet chain summon tactic. You're increasing your survivability where rapid health loss is a concern. The mana you're blowing on your pet certainly isn't going to be used to power any dots or nukes, so for a duration fight, you're actually hindering yourself doing it.

The special cases that make this ability something to watch out for from a balance perspective, however, are an example such as Howling Stones.

Normally the zone in to HS has 1-3 wanderers within aggro range of the drop off point. One or two of these is commonly undead.

Presently, attempting to break in solo is difficult, requiring concentration, a good understanding of your capabilities and various quantities of luck. You can use the following tactic if you understand how to start the summon and do a /pet get lost, as well, the main difference is in the 'from zone in to go' time, not the 'chain casting' ability. Given the ability to insta-summon a pet, however, we could zone in, have a pet nearly instantaneously, and having pre-memorized our pet-buff, be at near-full fighting power within a matter of seconds -- we might not even get aggro before we're ready -- if we do, we have mez, root, and undead slow at our disposal to give us enough time, and feign if things to awry. Given that we root or hold adds mezzed, or if undead, we slow them, we could have enough mana and time to let the first pet die, summon a second when he's down (we could even use reclaim energy, since there's no cast and /pet get lost), buff him when we get a few seconds, and we're off again. 2 pets and some secondary damage from us and we can drop the spawns one by one.

It's interesting to note that a cross section of necromancers I know comment on tactics like this with a wide range of responses from 'Cake', to 'j00 crazy'. Me? I don't typically do this sort of thing unless I'm really in a balls-to-the-wall mood. I typically get my roommates and we go break in just like everybody else, but knowing I don't have to is what makes me play a necro.

Good god, it's 5am and I can't think anymore. I'll just post this and let you deal with the repetition, inaccuracies and point out anything I've missed or gotten absolutely positively 100% dead wrong.

Expect more thoughts on necromancer balancing in general, likely in a slightly more lucid manner -- but don't bet on it.

I would like posts similar to this one (danger will robsinson, ego alert) and others that I have seen that are simply excellently done (you know the type) become part of a 'short list' of change requests and comments that we raise above the 'noise' to point to show what we want. Not that I'm saying this is something we asked for, but it is a possibility, so we may as well put our two bone chips in.
