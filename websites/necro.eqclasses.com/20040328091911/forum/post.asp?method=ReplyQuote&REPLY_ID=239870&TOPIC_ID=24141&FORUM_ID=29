If you pull with dark, follow it up with a splurt. the nice thing about splurt is you always know based on the damage when its about to finish. so when you see "your splurt has wore off..." you know you have 3-4 tries to resnare before your dark goes. <br /></span></font></td>

It's not as good as tables in terms of raw xp per kill but must be the next best solo XP spot in the game and these mobs die faster. Netting 9% AA per kill approx. The camp is where you set up to kill the two cheap birds, pulling the doomfire guys from Fort 1 and kiting them up and down past the bridge with magma guys. On the map the spot is to the left of the northmost Fort wall and the word 'UP' on the NW of map. Basically pull everything from fort - unending supply of mobs all soloable. Dont bother FD pulling these, if snare resists keep running and recasting until it lands. If snare fails on pull and you FD these mobs warp nearly everytime - so dont bother.<br /><br />Be warned these are more resistant to snare than the table mobs (worst case was 12 resists in a row). If the snare resists really freak you out, you can actually land scent of terris on these (usually in 2-3 casts) and then resist is virtually nil, but lowers your dps form lost spell slot and time to land terris - but 12 snare resists really sucks!. I use usual spell set here but substitue Splurt for FP and CoC (yes it lands here) for Pyro (Neuro just does not land enough and I dont have Horror but suspect would resist also). Avoid chaplins, they are clerics and like to CH themselves. I like this camp as it always open, it's actually more interesting than tables, unending supply of mobs to kill.<br /><br />Edit: Changed word 'castle' to 'fort' to avoid confussion<br /></span></font></td>

When you get onto the rampart, you can't run off the other side so go down the steps. Nothing here saw thru invis that I conned though some may.<br /><br />After you run out of the Fort, over the next bridge and into the field, lots will see invis. Make your way to the Castle. Everything there sees invis. Two roamers path by entrance, but all inside is static I think so you can just rush through to the tables. If you see two phonexis up as you approach exit to tables, avoid them. They are raid event triggers for a mob.<br /><br />The green dots are mobs.

I was at tables yesterday on my guild exp day, and I ground out 40aa's. You 'CAN' solo this spot but WTF would you want to. My setup...<br /><br />Saryn's Companion, summoners boon, rune of death<br /><br />Go grab a mob with snare, hit it with BoT to hold agro then grab ANOTHER mob with snare and hit it with bot. Make sure to have you pet attack second one so when first goes down it will just switch.<br />I run this spot with a full group, those are the only two spells I need to use when doing this.<br />I have access to a bard, run it as a bot when the other person isn't playing.<br />Now if you get 2 more necro's, 2 wizards and a mage, you can earn an aa every 30 mins. Even just one more necro. Anyways, all 3 necro's are kiting the mobs around in the fashion that i just mentioned, this is all they do. Set one of the wizards or mage as main assist and they will burn the mobs down very fast so I can run 2 mobs at a time for about 30 mins till i get to 20 mana. Then just kite singles while mana builds up for about 10 mins.<br /><br />Anyways, I was burning an aa every 20 mins like this. Just because you can solo doesn't really make it the best option.<br /><br />Btw FT15 plus 3 more from the aa's. Just make sure your wizards and mage are up to par with their mana regen. Bots are cool, log in a chanter for c5 and to haste pets so you dont have to bother with it as it slows down pulls.

With as much as 14% AA exp per kill solo or as little as 5% AA exp with a full group.  <br />However, why group when you can make 3x as much experience solo?  IF you have a wizard and a couple druids in your group, it's very much worth it.  Just pull a caster, and kite it around solo, while the wizard snares and kites 4 non-casting mobs and have the druids use their quad nukes once wizard has built up sufficient aggro.  Result is 5 mobs dead for 25%+ AA exp in the time it took you to solo and kite one mob.<br />How does PoFire compare to other elemental planes for exp?  PoEarth is the only other real popular one I know of.  The problem with PoEarth is that you need a full group, because everything there summons and sees invis.  However, a full group will yield about 4% AA exp per kill.  To make things worse, you can only kill one or two mobs at a time.  Although, on the up-side, PoEarth has tradeskill loot that tends to sell for more than PoFire items.<br />How does PoTime A compare to elemental planes for exp?  This is a huge disappointment.  I only got 7% AA exp per kill solo in PoTime A.  You would think it would be more, considering all the time put into getting keyed for this place.  However, it seems the sole purpose for PoTime A is to gather your raid force to raid PoTime b, while those who can forage get all the free food and drink they want.<br />Any way you slice it, PoFire is the best exp in game to date.  I imagine once GoD goes live, there will be people looking to grind all those extra AAs they need to get the new skills.  Expect PoFire to become very crowded.  You may want to team up with those quading classes to make the AA fly by faster.</span></font></td>

I have AEIV, AHIV, BAIV, FT12, couple regen.  Here are some of my observations.<br /><br />Solo:<br /><br />63 SK pet with LDON augment hasted with Rune of Death<br />Pull with embracing darkness.<br />Load Dark Plague, BoT, send pet, splurt.<br />Refresh Bot when it wears...total of four times<br />Re-darkness at ~ 65%<br />Refresh Splurt and DP ~ 50% when they wear off.<br />Re-darkness at ~ 35%<br />Apply Saryn's Kiss when necessary, one per mob.<br />In total, 4 BoT, 2 DP, 2 Splurt, 1 SK and constant ED<br /><br />Doing this, I can kill the 9 in the tables area and one from inside before respawns.  Always try to sit as often as possible.  I re-apply ED early, as sometimes they can resist numerous casts.<br /><br />In general, if I'm going to be there a while, I'll stick with this lineup.  Its the most efficient I've been able to achieve.  If I know I'm going to be logging soon, I'll start throwing on Horror to speed kills up a bit, but the mana stats to slowly deplete.<br /><br />The gear and focuses I have make things more efficient.  I would say Affliction Haste is the most important, for safety's sake.  After a string of ED resists, you'll appreciate the 2.1 cast time.  Otherwise, you'll most likely have to FD (after FD-ing pet, if possible) and try to start again with some room.  I couldn't figure out a way to get ED off un-hasted when snare broke.  I recently picked up AEIV, and have been toying with how it affects my kill rate.  I've been mostly grouping lately, or burning mana at the end of the night anyway, so its hard to tell what effect it has on long-term kiting, but I think it would prolly let me get a Horror in per mob, without too much hurt on the mana.  Which in turn might get another mob into the cycle.<br /><br />Grouping:<br /><br />In general, I'll round up a bunch of guildies to group here.  The key I have found is to have two toons that can kite.  Usually, its me and another necro, one will be kiting, the other will just sic the pet, maybe apply a SK or horror, then go grab a new one.  This way there is always one in camp, and the aggro you can generate while waiting for the first to die means no chance of other people out-aggroing you.  I've found that if I'm the only kiter in a group, and I have to go grab mobs after the first is killed, that it takes a lot of time, especially after you start running to the front of the castle to clear the PHs.<br /><br />The other setup I found works is to have an enchanter to work the pulls.  While the group is killing the one you are kiting, the enchanter goes, pulls one with tash, brings it to the tables, and mezzes it.  When the mob you are kiting dies, just break mez with ED, pop a BoT on, and you should have sufficient aggro for the chanter to run and grab another.  Depending on the group, I'll throw a Horror and/or CoC on for extra aggro and damage.  Having a chanter also makes the chain-CHing clerics much easier to kill.  A well timed chanter-mez and a concentrated effort by the nukers can kill the cleric before it gets a CH off.  I don't think I've ever seen a cleric get inturrupted any other way.  If there's no chanter, you have to grind it out til the cleric runs oom, or hope to get a good string of crits from the nukers.<br /><br />One night, with chanter pulling, me kiting, 2 wizzies, 1 druid, 1 mage, we were averaging about 25 minute AAs.  (Helped that we also had an out of group bard singing mana)  To kite, I would ED, BoT and Horror, and the mobs would die maybe a tick after BoT and Horror wore off.  Was killer.<br /><br />The other nice thing about grouping here, is the possibility of getting a named to spawn from the castle.  I've gotten a nice 85/85, regen 2 ring off the named.  The named summon, but the one we killed was a caster, and we basically burned it down while it cast crappy nukes, summon kiting with whoever had aggro.  Helped to have the chanter slow.  Lets see if I can get the links right....<br /><br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20804" target="_blank"><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20804" target="_blank">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20804</a></a><br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18959" target="_blank"><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18959" target="_blank">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18959</a></a><br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20803" target="_blank"><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20803" target="_blank">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20803</a></a><br /><br />The named will spawn in the huts in the castle.  As far as I can tell, the huts usualy have 4 mobs in them, one in each corner of the room.  If the hut has a fifth mob in the center, that should be a PH for the named.  Named are rare, I'd say a 1/25, maybe even 1/50 spawn from the PHs.  With a full group with good DPS, you should be able to keep the three huts with PHs cleared.<br /><br />Usually, I'll end up with a mish-mash group, and we won't get exp quite as fast as soloing, but the fact that you have people to chat with and the capability of taking breaks and getting resses or whatever offsets the loss for me.  The added AAs in the guild for clerics or warriors or whatever non-DPS class in the group seems like a reasonable trade off for slightly slower AA dings.<br /><br />Anyone care to comment, or add more observations?<br /><br />Eldaabo Locomuerte<br />Dawntreaders<br />Terris Thule</span></font></td>

When I started all I had was mage summoned BA4 and ceramic stuff. My mana regen was from SoS and Solstice Earring, that's it. I didn't even have 2000hp unbuffed. Maybe I'm not liked by the RNG but I never got more than 13% on kills and I watch that number closely :) Now that I got a few items I can kill without losing much mana and raid buffed I can kill easily the 9 mobs in there before repops. Self buffed I usually leave one up. Imo this camp is much better duoing, especially with a class who can regen. SK is not a very mana efficient spell, even with AE4. The xp with 2 people is usually 8-9% per kill, however the time to kill one is usually drops to 2 minutes from the 4 minutes solo. To me every 2 minutes 8% xp is better than 13% xp every 4 minutes, but that's just me. Pets do a lot of damage, any kinda pets, I even make druids make a bear. Tried to get away without AH4, that was the only time I died here :) Casting ED in 2.1 sec instead of 3.2 is a big help.<br /><br />There are 3 different type of mobs in the courtyard. Soldier, guardian and protector, not sure if there is level difference between them or what, but soldiers almost never resist anything. Guardians spawn with sick resists sometimes, if fennin trigger is not up, you can run to the ramp and try to recast snare till it sticks, my record is 11 resists on ED on one mob. According to eqcompanion all these mobs have 42-43k hp.<br /><br />One other thing, after like 6 boring AA on a Sunday morning you absolutely hate this place and never wanna see it again...ever :) But xp is good, so you'll be back, hehe.</span></font></td>

One thing I absolutely LOVE about necro's and laying on the dots is all of the 'stuff' that's going down in the background while those dots are ticking.. how much dmg per tic, how much mana used, mana regen rate, wtd refresh, rebuff my pet, which dot is going to wear off (I sometimes start recasting a dot before I get the 'wears off' message, and I'll get the wears off message before I finish casting). <br /><br />-Other 'brain ticking' moves, for example, if I get 3 dark resists in a row, I'll try Horror once, and if it's resisted, I may or may not skip recasting it again, b/c I am pretty sure it'll probably get resisted. If I see that I used up x ammount of mana on that pull, I may sit, stretch, send a tell or two and rest a second before resuming pulls. After over 100 aa dings at the picnic tables, I'd say I can give some 'tested and tried' advice on what works for me there.<br /><br />-Another point to make, is that I've found it way less stressfull to burn up that mana, kill the mob in less than 4 minutes, then sit and med for a few seconds, and resume pulls. "4 minutes, short rest, 4 minutes, short rest, repeat" &gt; "5 minute kills, nonstop pulling, conserving mana." <br /><br />-AND if I solo a mob in less than 4 minutes, I only need 2 Embracing Darkness casts (save little mana), and usually only cast 1 Saryn's Kiss and 1 Dark Plague. I let Horror and BoT do most of the work. If you are 'stretching' things out, you might be casting Saryn's Kiss x2, DPx2, EDx3?...<br /><br />-Again, when I started exp'ing here at picnic tables, it took me a good 45 minutes to solo an aa, but through the course of 100 aa's, a few equipment upgrades, INTENSE waiting till the last second to stand up, and run again, I feel I've about maximized my aa potential here, with my current setup of aa's and mana regen (I'm currently working on the extended affliction aug in BB to go further).<br /><br />Don't chain Horror for example, it's quite efficient in itself (more than BoT anyway), but resisted often and the mana/tick you need to sustain it is very high, use it only when you have too much mana (above 90-95%) to haste a kill<br /><br />-I used to agree with this. I got SOO frustrated with horror resists at times, that I'd unmem it. BUT, I 'tried again' and now, for some reason, I seem to get a lot less resists overall (over the last 30 or so aa's that is)<br /><br />-While I'm at it, and b/c this is a guide section, I'll share a couple other 'tricks'. If you plan on being able to crank out a LONG exp session here, pick up a journeyman's walking stick for your pet. The debuff will do wonders for your dots :)<br /><br />-This should be a no brainer BUT, if you don't have a burning affliction, or equivalent focus item (and a affliction effeciency 4), DON'T COME HERE UNTIL YOU GET STUFF FROM A MAGE!<br /><br />-GROUP UP HERE! There are a couple variations on this. Multiple necro's, each kiting their own mob individually works well, or 'any combo' all focus'ing on one kited mob. I like the 'whole group on one mob' personally (especially when there are 2 necro's in group), b/c mobs go down real fast, you pull nonstop, and can pull any kind of mob (clerics go down fast too). AND you can rotate out taking breaks, to keep group from all burning out from the fast paced killing (I've even rotated out 'timed' 5 minute breaks before). The only thing that really sucks about the full group thing is if you get people in the group who don't do their share. For me though, I really dont care too much, b/c guildies getting aa's makes my guild more powerfull and helps me in long run too (often have a cleric in my group heh)<br /><br />I RARELY find grouping better exp than solo'ing though! HOWEVER, I can sit here grouped for hours, chatting, taking turns doing the kiting, taking my afk breaks, and seeing the aa's go by w/o coming close to 'burning out' b/c I get bored or too stressed at the spot.</span></font></td>

Guilds seem to change recruiting policies once they get there.  They are less willing to backflag people once they have arrived and set AA/Flag requirements.  Unless you have friends in high end raiding guilds, you probably won't be able to get into one that already has the bulk of their members elemental flagged without being very close to elementals yourself.  And if you're asking, you are a ways off.<br /><br />   b) If you're on E'ci, start raiding with the public raiding groups.  One group is already has Water/Air/Earth and another is filling the void for backflagging for all guilds (they did TZ last night).  I don't know if any other servers have this kind of public raiding force or not, but you may check around.<br /><br />   c) Look for guilds that can't do it on there own, but have alliances to take out the bigger targets.<br /><br />PoFire access doesn't happen quickly.  It takes awhile even with a concerted effort.  You are racing other guilds for spawns and even if you get the spawn, you still have to learn the encounter and then beat it multiple times.</span></font></td>
