        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Here comes Verant again, and *GASP* the customer is wrong, the <b>Vision</b> is correct again--you had a doubt!?!!</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote>Hello all,<BR>Recently I've not only received emails specifically regarding the Conquest guild issue, but also about exploiting in general. </P><P>First, some people are confused as to what an exploit is and how they're to know what an exploit is. Some are also afraid they might accidentally exploit and then be disciplined.</P><P>An exploit, quite simply, is using a bug in the game to your advantage. Most of them are obvious: attacking NPCs that are stuck, or the ability to duplicate items or money. But we do realize it's not always easy to tell.</P><P>To this end it has been and will continue to be our policy to warn people when they are caught exploiting. It basically works like this:</P><P>1. You are caught exploiting, you receive a warning and the exploit is explained to you.<BR>2. You are caught exploiting again (this includes either literally being caught or caught and we have evidence you were aware it was an exploit -- in other words, premeditated exploiting) and you are suspended for a period of time.<BR>3. You are caught exploiting yet again -- you are banned.</P><P>A second issue that's arisen is the question: why do we care if people are exploiting? Are we just upset they're not playing the game the way we wanted them to?</P><P>The answer is honestly "no, that has nothing to do with it." The following is an email and my reply to it which I think more clearly explains why we cannot allow bug exploitation in EverQuest:</P><P>-----Original Message-----<BR>From: Robert Mayer <BR>Sent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 7:30 AM<BR>To: bmcquaid@verant.com<BR>Subject: Question</P><P><BR>You guys seem to be holding players responsible for doing things the game allows but you don't intend to happen. You are labeling as "exploits" anything that is possible, but doesn't fit into the game as you designed it. </P><P><BR>Then I guess I failed to communicate the issues very effectively, because that is absolutely NOT what we're doing. We are labeling exploits as we always have, that being using bugs to your advantage in-game. Conquest used spell stacking bugs to their advantage and they used a safe zone (an area where a pathing bug made it such that an NPC wouldn't pursue those it was mad at) to their advantage.</P><P><BR>Now correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that in effect you're saying "look, we aren't perfect, we can't code a game that is 100% free of loopholes because nobody can, but you should as players be able to infer what we intend, and if you do things that are clearly going against our intent, that's an exploit and you'll be disciplined." </P><P><BR>Yes and no. We're saying that taking advantage of bugs is NOT ok. And we're saying that 1. knowing you're exploiting a bug and 2. where and to what end your exploiting, are both factors in determining how we react to a player or players who are exploiting. </P><P><BR>Whew. I've never heard a game company essentially say that the players are responsible for the developer's programming, design, and implementation errors. No offense, because I realize it's a bitch to run a game like EQ, but it seems absurd to me to expect players to do anything but try their utmost to use every single tool you give them, deliberately or accidentally, to succeed. After all, the only point of EQ, beyond chatting, is to level up, and the only rewards beyond the social come from leveling up and killing things. You put umpteen thousand people into a world and tell them "go forth and kill MOBs," and by gum they're gonna do it. You can't reasonably then expect them to adhere to something like "oh, and only kill MOBs the way we intend for you to kill them!" </P><P><BR>No, they're responsible for not taking advantage of bugs in-between the time they're discovered and when we have a chance to fix them. And we've always had this policy. UO certainly has this policy, and I think AC does to an extent now. And I'd submit the majority of persistent, massively multiplayer community based games in the future will have these policies. Why? Well, because what you do in a community based game like this affects other players. If you take advantage of a dupe bug, you can hurt the economy, and ruin the play experience of hundreds if not thousands of other players. If you take advantage of a pathing bug and kill a monster to obtain loot that you really shouldn't be able to, then the guy who did work harder to obtain that same loot without exploiting is not going to feel very entertained. Rather, he's going to feel frustrated and perhaps even regret that he did it the 'right way'. It's the same as in real life -- society is generally NOT ok with taking short cuts (especially at the expense of others). Insider Trading is not ok. Cutting through a parking lot to avoid traffic is not ok. Embezzling and stealing and cheating to advance oneself at the expense of others is NOT ok. And so why the heck should it be ok in the communities and societies that are being developed in online computer games? Because it's a game? Does my sense of accomplishment and are my feelings about right and wrong somehow less valid inside a virtual reality than they are in the real world? </P><P>No man is an island, and that includes a person in Norrath.</P><P><BR>From reading all of the public info on the Conquest incident, it seems to me that these guys simply took advantage of holes your programmers left in the game. If an NPC can't summon or move for X seconds or due to Y geometry, um, tough titty to you, Kitty--fix it. If you leave it in, you can't ethically blame someone for taking advantage of it. It's your responsibility, and you'rs (Verant's) alone, to make the game unexploitable. </P><P><BR>Agreed to a point, and expanding on that, it's Verant's responsibility to make sure we are offering an entertaining and fair play environment for our customers. And so we fix bugs, and we also crack down on players who would use bugs to cheapen the playing experience of others.</P><P>And I disagree it's unethical to blame a player for taking advantage of a bug. If a person leaves the door open at their place of business, thereby creating a hole in the company's security, yes, it's the person's fault for doing this. But that doesn't mean it's ok for someone to come along and enter the building, taking advantage of the open door. He gets blamed too.</P><P><BR>Now, if players change the code, hack it, or abuse other players, disciplinary action seems warranted. But to even bother suspending players whose only real "crime" seems to be to take advantage of coding problems on your end--well, you're asking way too much of your customers. </P><P><BR>But taking advantage of coding or data problems can in some cases ABUSE OTHER PLAYERS, which is the point I apparently failed miserably to communicate, because it keeps coming up, not just in your email but in others.</P><P><BR>Once you create the world, it isn't yours any more, just like when a novelist writes a book. If someone wants to interpret The Stand as an allegory about French cooking, there's nothing Stephen King can do about it. Yeah, an online game isn't as passive as a book, but it's the same concept. You guys seem to be holding on way too tight. Who cares if they "exploit" the flaws in the programming? Turn off the zone, fix the flaws, and go on. Every single exploit you guys identify should be seen as an opportunity to improve the game or refine it--that's good, and it's your right. But to discipline players for finding your mistakes… man, that's pretty low. </P><P><BR>Again, reading a book is not a shared, community based experience. Misinterpreting a book, and for a better analogy, cheating in a single player game does NOT hurt the play experience for others. But, and this is the key point here, cheating in a shared community based online experience DOES. </P><P>thanks,</P><P>-- <BR>--------------------------------------------- <BR>Brad McQuaid <BR>Vice President, Premium Games <BR>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive <BR><hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>Ok now that you're done reading some 1984 style propaganda, here's some really funny shit...</P><P><i>No man is an island, and that includes a person in Norrath.</i></P><P>Bwahahaha, this is hillarious. I guess this is really true, because the premise of an island, AKA the Necromancer, has been destroyed in the name of good old fashion grouping. This is also ironic as hell, as this statement promotes a certain shunning of individuality, which is why everyone looks alike, carries the same weapons, holds the same steins, all hailing each other. Aradune, ever been to Stalingrad?!</P><P>No really, Aradune is stupid as hell, here's why. His crappy statement WOULD BE TRUE, <b>BUT</b>, Verant doesnt fix bugs! Hence reporting them is a waste of time, and if they were truely bugs, like the great nerfs that were bugs, then they'd be fixed. BUT VERANT DOESNT FIX BUGS. How am i exploiting if its been reporting a thousand times and never been fixed?!? You know what that tells me, its not a god damn bug. Sorry Aradune, you're entire pompous speech means absolutely dick.

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Yep.  VI has 2 categories of bugs.</P><P>1.  We screwed up and it sucks to be you category.  Go read about the getting charmed & losing pet summoning capabilites.  Quote</P><P>"When I said that it sounded like a rare case, I meant just that. It's probably not that common that you get charmed. I have no problem believing that it happens every time you DO get charmed, just that being charmed isn't something that happens every day to a character. </P><P>And I looked it up. The bug has been in the database since December. So we are aware of it, and have been. Obviously we haven't been quick to fix the bug, but we are certainly aware of it."</P><P>LOL.  Not that common?  Bwahahahahaha.  Hey guys..I'm level 60 in Sol B and get charmed by a level 30 mob.  MMMMMM.  Perhaps they've forgotten that NPCs don't play by the same rules.  It's only not that common because of the few enchanter NPCs in game.  But trust me, all 30+ enchanter NPCs have noooo problem charming me or my pet.  But I'm glad to hear that 6 months can pass on a sucks to be you problem.</P><P>Like pathing issues<BR>Like shadowbond not working on players under 45<BR>Like stacking issues - splurt then asystole works....asystole then splurt doesn't</P><P>2.  We screwed up and you will benefit from it.  PRIORITY.  Take down the servers NOW.</P><P>Example:  Part of our epic quest piece dropping off the wrong mob in the wrong zone.</P><P>The reality seems to be that the majority of fixers are busy working on the new expansion, quests, whatever.  Only if something in Category 2 comes up do they actually turn around and fix it.  Otherwise they just tell GMs about category 1, keep it to themselves, and punish people for playing the game.</P><P>A real gaming company would post a page of known bugs so the players could know what not to do.  Like the real world.  Signs are put up on the freeways so you know what speed you are "supposed" to follow.  Of course you could "exploit" the freeway by speeding, but if you get caught... well.  Can't argue with a sign can you?</P><P>Sigh.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

When they stop blaming players for connectivity issues and in game problems and so on, when they can step back and actually fess up to their mistakes, when they can finally see the game through the players eyes rather than the rose colored bi-focals they hand out at Verant...then and only then would this kind of approach to game issues work. </P><P></P><P><BR> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">I have a question about all this.. I read alot and it seems that verant is trying to hit the "A mob wants to attack you but cant" deal.  The re-summon time is 10 seconds.  I have never seen a map of the place but if a mob summons you and you run (being a cleric) the mob can chase you up to the safe point right? Well I figure it at least takes 5+ seconds to run back under the bridge assuming you live and you cant be CoH'd from the battle unless the magician is constantlly CoH'ing you because thats a 12 sec cast time and soon as he gets it off if your still alive you will be summoned right back up.  So that leaves at max what 5 secs when the mob would want to hit you but cant.  I dont know just dosnt seem like their theory is to well thought out.  About spell stacking, dont alot of big time raids use rez'ing in to keep fighting deal?  Isnt the hit off of rez effects greater than the aoe slow? I mean rez effects wear off quicklly and then you will just get hit with the AOE and even then it dosnt stop his dmg aoe from hitting you.</P><P><center><img src="http://members.spree.com/funNgames/WE_YANKEES/potusnbarnie.gif" border=0><BR>The True Nerf</center></P><P>Xalten Deadbeat<BR>Level 52 Gnecro<BR>Resident of Rodcet Nife<BR><a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
