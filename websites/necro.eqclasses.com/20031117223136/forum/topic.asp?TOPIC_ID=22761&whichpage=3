They are very similar terms, and can often be used interchangibly.  <b>Moral</b> implies conformity to established sanctioned codes or accepted notions of right and wrong &lt;the basic <i>moral</i> values of a community&gt;.  <b>Ethical</b> may suggest the involvement of more difficult or subtle questions of rightness, fairness, or equity &lt;committed to the highest <i>ethical</i> principles&gt;<br /><br />Thus the law would be more based on the morals of a community, however large.  While the law may dip into ethical issues, more often, the law leaves much to be desired.  There are many things you can do, in regular life, and in business, that are legal, but definitely not ethical.<br /><br />Our government is built so that we can govern ourselves based on the morals found in our communities.  A fine example of this are dry counties.  <br /><br /></span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

Not the crap that appeared in that article you linked but the actual facts of the case.<br /><br />First Ms. Ehlert is found guilty of murder. It is overturned since the DA brought up 2 previous abortions the defendant had. The judges rule this inflamatory and force a second trial. Ms. Ehlert is found guilty a second time. She appeals on grounds that the prosecutor failed to prove the child was born alive. The appeals court agree and overturns the verdict.<br /><br />The facts supporting live birth come from Mr. King the fiance of the woman on trial. He states that he thinks he heard a child cry for a second or two. This concludes the facts supporting life birth.<br /><br />The medical examiner testified that that the child had air in its lungs, blood in the umbical cord, and hemmoraging in the skull. She also conceded that all of these could occur naturally from the child birth process and decomposition of the body. When ask if she had medical evidence the child was born alive she conceded she had none. She relied on Mr King testimony about the 2 second cry he heard. Mr. King, however, was less than certain that he heard this cry. Further he saw no movement or sound from the bedroom where the birth took place in the 5 minutes following the birth. During this time Ms. Elhert had gone to wash up. <br /><br />This is an excellent example of the silly lengths some conservative sources will go to show liberal judges killing children via absurd abortion rulings. This case has nothing to do with abortion. It has to do with whether a child was born alive or not. The DA did not prove that the child was born alive therefore Ms Ehlert can not be guilty of murder. While I think Ms Ehlert behaved stupidly and should have delivered in a hospital the DA still must prove its case.<br /><br />Kebkeck you really should look at the whole story and not rely on a partisan source like you linked. That article is a shameful misrepresentation of the facts. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/AppellateCourt/2002/1stDistrict/November/Html/1000273.htm" target="_blank">http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/AppellateCourt/2002/1stDistrict/November/Html/1000273.htm</a><br /><br />That is the judge's ruling.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

Liberals will fight for the rights of those that can't fight for themselves unless those individuals are unborn or partially birthed babies.. you sir support baby killing.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Kebkeck, you don't know didly-squat about the law, either about how it works or the specifics of the politics of different judges around the country.  I'll give you a couple hints about this case.<br /><br />First, the case has $%^&-all to do with abortion.  Its ancient common law that if an infant dies shortly before or during delivery, it cannot be a murder victim.  This rule dates back to merry olde England, and was set down by Blackthorne in the 17th century. A lot of states in the USA have adopted new laws in the last few years governing fetal viability and homicide, but Illinois ain't one of them, so the old common law rule applies.<br /><br />The court applied the old rule, and decided the prosecution was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the child had been born alive.  But the ONLY evidence presented at trial that the child was alive was a statement by one witness that he _might_ have heard a baby cry.  He admitted he wasn't completely sure.  In contrast, the prosecution's medical examiner could not say for certain the child was born alive, and two defense doctors testified that the child was stillborn.  <br /><br />Legalese?  No, its called looking at the facts and applying the law as it exists, not as the judges would LIKE the law to be.<br /><br />And here's another hint.  Appellate judges in Illinois are not known for being liberals, or for their sympathy to abortion rights generally.  On the contrary, for close to two decades befoe this decision, Republican, pro-life governors had been appointing the judges.  <br /><br />In fact, thats how the lady got convicted to begin with.  A pro-life judge served as finder of fact when both sides waived a jury trial.  And he convicted based on evidence that turned out to be remarkably flimsy.  The appellate judges didn't have much choice but to overturn the conviction.<br /><br />The truth is probably that the kid was stillborn after a two-day labor that apparently was induced as the result of Mom falling out a tree.  Thats hardly surprising.  Then a borderline retard and her borderline retard boyfriend flushed the dead kid down the toilet because they were afraid of getting into trouble.<br /><br />Should the mom have her reproductive organs removed?  Sure....for being a low-garde moron with inferior genes we don't want passed on to future generations, not for being a murderess.  Hell, this whole case can be viewed as Darwinian evolution in action.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

In Illinois, that has NEVER been the LAW....EVER.<br />In fact, that wasn't the LAW anywhere in the English-speaking world, until many, many years after the Supreme Court legalized abortion in Roe v. Wade.  So claiming it has something to do with abortion makes you an ignorant jack-ass.<br /><br /><br />Now maybe it SHOULD be the law.  But it is not and never was.  Your belief that it should be the law doesn't make it the law.  For it to become the law requires an act of the Illinois legislature. We don't send people to prison in this country _unless_ they break the law, and it can be proven they broke the law beyond a reasonable doubt.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"> I'm not convinced it was dead, moreover I'm more convinced it was alive.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />You have psychic powers?

If she wanted to get rid of the kid, she could have walked into an abortion clinic any time during the previous 6-9 months and gotten one perfectly legally.  Instead, she waited until the kid was born, then flushed the poor thing down the toilet while it was crying?  <br /><br />Yeah.  Right.  Because YOU say thats the way things happened.  And you just KNOW, in the absence of any kind of evidence or proof whatever.<br /><br />Sorry, this lady was grotesquely stupid.  But we don't imprison people for being stupid, only for commiting crimes.  And we require actual proof that they have committed a crime, too.<br /><br /></span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

But so what?<br /><br />You see, there are ALWAYS two other parties present during any act of sexual intercourse.  The first is the child who might be conceived as a result, and the other is the society that has to deal with this child as it grows up and becomes an adult.  And they never signed on to "unspoken but understood bond".  In fact, they have some serious objections to it, and would never agree with it.<br /><br />Society says YOU bear as much responsibility as the woman for the kids welfare, because society doesn't feel like paying for the externalities(side effects) of your fooling around.  Why the %^&* should society pay the price of YOUR fun?  And the child also never agreed to grow up without support from her father.  Why should she pay the price of mom's and your fun?<br /><br />Every culture on earth has serious taboos, mores and laws governing sex and reproduction for just this reason.  They all amount to efforts to fix responsibility for taking care of a child onto the child's parents, instead of letting them fobb it off onto the rest of us.  Efforts to enforce "You broke it, you bought it" seem to be hardwired into the human brain.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

However, if you go on a test drive, and decide you don't want the car, and the woman does, should you be responsible for 1/2 the payments?  Why not?  You did the test drive together...  <br /><br />Sex is the same way.  I take every precaution necessary to insure that my boys won't find a home in the chicks womb.  However, with the medical technology WE have, and the OPTIONS she has, if she CHOOSES to keep the child, then it should be HERS.  If there was no option, BUT to keep the kid, then I'd agree 100% that both parents should be responsible.  However, it is when the chick IGNORES her other choices that the matter becomes gray.  <br /><br />Here's what it boils down to:<br /><br />-You have sex, taking all the necessary and possible precautions to insure she doesn't get pregnant.<br />-She get's pregnant.<br />-There are now 3 equal options:  1 is to abort, the other is to keep, the third is to give it up for adoption<br /><br />If she decides to keep it, knowing full well that she can abort it or give it up for adoption, then she is taking on the responsibility of the child.   Her decision to keep the child **SHOULD NOT** bind you to financial obligation for 18 years.  Her decision should not cripple your life.  Her decision, since she has 100% of the power to make the choice, should not be forced onto you.<br /><br />With all the other options, and it being her choice, it should not be a man's burden.  Again, if there was no other choice, fine, however, because she does have other options and avenues, putting this on the man to pay for is crap.<br /><br />Personally, if it happened to me, I'd tell her "hey you wanted the kid, you go get a job, I'll stay home with the rug rat"...<br /><br />At least I could play EQ most of the day that way while she toils and works in some factory for minimum wage.

They cite 4 cases to determine the bar for 'separate and independent life'. None of them require the cord to be cut! The fact that you cling to this belief in the light of direct evidence to the contary is disturbing. If a mother killed her living child while the cord was still attached she would be found guilty of murder if it could shown the child was in fact alive. A living infant would show strangulation bruises for instance.<br /><br />In the article you post states as fact the infant was crying. This was conjecture at best. The article you posted states it is a fact that a mother can murder her healthy new born provided the umbilical cord is attached. This is absolutely false. You seem to want to believe in a certain position and only rely on evidence that supports that position. The amazing thing is in the presense contradictory evidence your faith in the events of the case become absolute.<br /><br />Kebkeck how did the mother kill her child? (Please do not say she was negligent or stupid she was both. The charge however is murder. ) Did she strangle the infant? Did she use blunt trauma? Did she stab it?

However, if you go on a test drive, and decide you don't want the car, and the woman does, should you be responsible for 1/2 the payments?  Why not?  You did the test drive together...   <br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Herein lies your problem.  Dating, kissing, making out, groping, oral sex, etc... all of that is the test drive.  Sex is signing the promissory note.  <br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br />Sex is the same way.  I take every precaution necessary to insure that my boys won't find a home in the chicks womb.  However, with the medical technology WE have, and the OPTIONS she has, if she CHOOSES to keep the child, then it should be HERS.  If there was no option, BUT to keep the kid, then I'd agree 100% that both parents should be responsible.  However, it is when the chick IGNORES her other choices that the matter becomes gray. <br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Not that this really has anything to do with the matter at hand, but in many cases, the mother doesn't want the father to have anything to do with the child, but the father can go through the legal system to get visitation rights and be a part of the child's life.  Under your system, what works for the goose works for the gander, and the father of children would have absolutely no rights, not ever.  So if you did get a woman pregnant, and wanted to help raise the child, she could tell you to fuck right the fuck off, and there would be nothing you could do about it.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br />Here's what it boils down to:<br /><br />-You have sex, taking all the necessary and possible precautions to insure she doesn't get pregnant.<br />-She get's pregnant.<br />-There are now 3 equal options:  1 is to abort, the other is to keep, the third is to give it up for adoption<br /><br />If she decides to keep it, knowing full well that she can abort it or give it up for adoption, then she is taking on the responsibility of the child.   Her decision to keep the child **SHOULD NOT** bind you to financial obligation for 18 years.  Her decision should not cripple your life.  Her decision, since she has 100% of the power to make the choice, should not be forced onto you.<br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />The rub is in the fact that before you had sex, you <b>knew</b> that there was a possibility she could get pregnant, and you <b>knew</b> that the issue would then be in her hands, and you <b>knew</b> that if she decided to keep it you would pay.  Yes, when a woman gets pregnant, the ball is in her court, but you're the one who put it there.<br /><br />Since you like analogies, I'll try to use one to get my point across.  Having sex with a woman is like going up in a plane and jumping out tandem.  If the main doesn't open, you'd better hope she packed a reserve.  Maybe she doesn't believe in reserve chutes, or didn't know how to pack it right, either way, you're both fucked.  When you jumped out of the plane with her, you put yourself at her mercy.  When you fuck her, it's just like jumping out that plane door.  <br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br />With all the other options, and it being her choice, it should not be a man's burden.  Again, if there was no other choice, fine, however, because she does have other options and avenues, putting this on the man to pay for is crap.<br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />What you are failing to see is that the initial option <b>was</b> yours.  You have to decide to "opt out" <b>before</b> you fuck her, not after she's pregnant.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br />Personally, if it happened to me, I'd tell her "hey you wanted the kid, you go get a job, I'll stay home with the rug rat"...<br /><br />At least I could play EQ most of the day that way while she toils and works in some factory for minimum wage.  After all, it was her decision.<br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Sounds like a plan to me.

You're in a perfect position to do something about  your potential problem...i.e.  keep your penis to yourself.  You know the rules.<br /><br />Yeah...if a mother does this to you, she's a bitch.

The money for child support isn't for the mother, and I sure hope you aren't planning on getting blowjobs from your child.  The money you pay for child support is to support the child.  If the child's mother were to be unable to support the child, and someone else had to take care of it, you would still be responsible for paying child support.  <br /><br />Alimony is a totally separate issue, and there are cases in which alimony is warranted, but that's a different argument for a different day.  If you didn't want to pay alimony to your wife, that's not a big deal, but if you had kids, and wouldn't support them, then you'd be in the same deadbeat dad category that all of the rest of the men who don't pay child support.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

I enjoy a debate with someone who doesn't agree but thinks about their arguements.<br /><br />Next, if the purpose of the sex was to beget children, then I agree, even after the divorce, the husband should pay child support, and hopefully assit in the education and raising of the child.<br /><br />However, I'm talking about instances where it is sex for sex.  Where there is no love, no commitment, etc.  These, in my mind, are two separate cases.  In the former, the dad should be responsible.<br /><br />It is when the woman, for selfish reasons (and it is selfish going into a situation where you are to raise a child alone with no support from the other parent) decides to keep the child.  She knows the man isn't necessarily going to be part of their lives, but decides to keep it.  <br /><br />Fuck her.  Seriously.  She has the ability to give it up for adoption, instead of ruining 3 lives by keeping it.  Instead of doing the smart thing, she does the emotional thing, and decides that in her web of self absorbtion, to drag the child, and the father into it.  <br /><br />If she wants a play thing to dress up (because these women are not thinking rationally and thinking the kids are barbie dolls) she can get herself a Cabbage patch kid.  <br /><br />I guess we won't agree.  I just think it's stupid that with so many options for a good home for the child (adoption is in high demand) that the woman would ask for child support (which in most cases is not even enough to pay the minimum a child needs for a month) instead of doing the sensible thing.  It's simple idiotic.<br /><br />I know if I was ever in this situation, I will ask for custody and if I get it, I'll give the kid up for adoption.  Take the decision from the idiots and make the right choice.<br /><br />And there is no case in which alamony is warranted.  Once you're done with the hole, she's done with your cash.  That's the way it should be.  These $10000 per month cases, unless the woman built the company up (in which case she deserves half, but that's of the company's assets, not the husbands) she deserves what she brought into the relationship, 1/2 of what you made together, the clothes on her back, and a kick in the ass.  That is all.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>
