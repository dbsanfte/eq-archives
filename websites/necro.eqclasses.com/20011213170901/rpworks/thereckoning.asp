      </span>The green chain mail glistened in the last remaining sunlight as
      Kaymen made his way off the boat and onto the docks of Butcher Block,
      where he was greeted warmly by the Dwarven lady. She ushered him towards
      the road leading to the great city of Kaladim where he could rest for the
      night. Dawrven guards stood silently at the great gates of this
      magnificent city, their armor softly chinking together as they watched him
      approach.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hail mighty ranger, we have
      been awaiting your arrival. Our scouts&nbsp; reported the Troll’s
      passing 2 days ago.” Guard Bloodforge called to him. “Ahh then I am
      not far behind the beast, this bodes well.” Kaymen swiftly replied as he
      past the guards and entered the city gates.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His footsteps echoed in the
      long stone halls of the underground city, a young Dwarf Paladin rushed to
      his side and led him to his room. It was a small room but nicely kept and
      cool. It always seemed to him a light mist flowed throughout this city at
      all times, cooling the long halls and small shops that lined the great
      stone walls of Kaladim. It was a refreshing change from the long boat trip
      from which he had just come. He unpacked a few things and took off the
      magnificent Ivy Etched Armor that protected his small Elvin body and
      placed it on a table next to the bed. The young Paladin made another
      appearance with a large mug of Dwarven Ale and a plate full of steaming
      food, put it on the table and disappeared again. Kaymen ate heartily and
      then lay down to sleep for the battle was near and he needed his strength.
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He woke with the morning sun
      and equipped his armor and his weapons, placing his Ykeshas in their
      sheaths around his belt. He strode past the two guards at the city gates.
      “Good luck mighty Kaymen! May Mithaniel Marr guide your arrows.”
      Kaymen bowed to the guards and thanked them for their kind words and made
      his way to the Greater Faydark.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Troll he was in search of
      was Drizag, a powerful Shadowknight from the vast swamps of Innothule. He
      had been tracking this Troll for months when a close friend of his sent
      word the Skadowknight had been seen in the Butcher Block Mountains. He was
      close now, he could feel the battle drawing near, and this was not a
      battle he was sure he could win. He owed this vile beast, for this Troll
      had slain his own blood, his sister, and many others that dwelled upon the
      Sister Isle in the Ocean of Tears. “Oh yes this Troll will feel his
      arrows!”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaymen traveled the long road
      leading to the great forests of Faydark looking for any sign of Drizag,
      but found nothing. He continued on pressing towards the woods only a days
      travel ahead. Nightfall came and he could see a faint firelight in the
      distance just beyond the edge of the forest. Could that be him? He
      whispered to himself in the darkness that engulfed him like a black sea.
      If it was the Drizag, he wasn’t about to face him at night, the powers
      of a Shadowknight are strong, and stronger yet in the darkness. He would
      take no chances with this one for he was strong and had felled many great
      warriors, he would wait till morning and make his move once the Troll was
      in the misty forests of the Faydark.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sky glowed with orange
      light as the sun rose against the darkened sky. Kaymen stood and looked
      towards the tall trees marking the forests of the Elves. The Ranger began
      chanting a spell a kind druid had taught him just before the long boat
      trip to Butcher Block. Magical light surrounded his body as he felt the
      Spirit of a great wolf enter his veins. He ran down a little known path
      leading to the great woods of Faydark and slipped into the mists of the
      mighty forest. Surly he was ahead of the lazy Troll he could find no trace
      of his entrance into these woods and then he saw the large booted
      footprint of the beast, and heard a low rumbling. Quickly and silently he
      dashed into a small patch of brush and hid there.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black armor gleamed from up
      ahead, as the Troll lumbered towards a large wolf snarling at him, teeth
      bared. Drizag began a small chant and a sickly green light surrounded the
      wolf, killing it instantly, from the blistering corpse of the wolf a green
      mist floated up and towards the Troll engulfing him. His muscles bulged
      and rippled with strength as the mist seeped into his body. His eyes
      gleamed with hatred, as he sniffed the air.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaymen quietly backed away and
      began his own chanting, Mystical lights surrounded him, his skin turning
      hard as steel, strength and agility ripped through his body like fire
      through a forest, thorns sprung from his skin in a protective barrier. His
      swords gleamed with frightening light as he placed them in their sheaths
      and drew his bow.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Is dat an Elfie me smells?”
      Drizag grunted into the still forest.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That it
      is, foul Troll” Kaymen replied.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drizag spun his huge body around to face
      the Elves voice.&nbsp; “Me tinks me smelled a meal.” He said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You disgrace this forest with your
      presence Drizag, I have tracked you many days to rid Norrath of your
      presence.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Kaymen is dat you? Me tinks you might
      come for Drizag after what him did to you sister. Her screamed good before
      her died. Her tasted even gooder.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaymen began chanting and roots
      surged from the forests floor ripping into the Troll’s huge feet and
      legs, holding him in place as the ranger sent an arrow screaming silently
      towards his foe. The arrow was true, it slammed into the beast’s hand
      causing him to drop his shield and roar in agony. Drizag stumbled back as
      the roots subsided, yanking the arrow out of his bleeding hand and picking
      up his shield once again. The ranger called upon a great bolt of lighting
      that surged from the sky, and singed the ground as it struck the Troll
      knocking him back and dazing him. Kaymen dropped his bow and rushed
      towards the green monster, Ykeshas drawn. Drizag managed to cast a spell
      and Kaymen felt his skin begin to blister as the sickly green mist
      surrounded him, and drain the very life from his body. He could see the
      Troll’s hand begin to immediately heal and the burns begin to fade away.
      The Troll sidestepped and dodged Kaymen’s fury as his blades struck out,
      meeting nothing but air. Bright lights danced across Kaymen’s vision as
      the beast brought down his shield on the ranger’s head, knocking him a
      few yards away. Kaymen stood up and called forth a swarm of stinging
      insects that engulfed Drizag. Both Ykeshas grew warm with power and Kaymen
      rushed in yet again. He ripped into the Troll’s armor swords blazing,
      and commanded the power of the Ykeshas. Green skulls filled the air as
      Drizag was struck by the force, tearing into his Darkforge leaving huge
      gaping wounds in his green flesh. Drizag stumbled and fell to the ground
      dead.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaymen walked a few yards from
      the fallen troll and dropped to his knees, still weary from the blow to
      the head. When he caught a movement out of the corner of his eye. Drizag
      was not dead! He had feigned his death and was charging towards him.
      Hatred flashed in the Troll’s eyes his<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>open wounds pouring putrid blood. The ranger was racked with pain
      as the Shadowknight did what they are known for, harmtouch. Drizag picked
      up Kaymen and slammed him into a nearby tree knocking the wind out of him
      and causing him to drop his swords. Darkness engulfed the Elf confusing
      him and dimming the light from his eyes. Kaymen grabbed for his swords but
      could not find them. He stood and began his casting Drizag lumbered in too
      late to stop the cast but managed to plow into him again, knocking him to
      the ground yet again. Blood flowed from his head and the darkness ate at
      his very soul but he had managed to snare the troll, that may buy him some
      time. He needed a weapon fast before the beast could break the snare.<br>
      ”Damn this darkness” he cursed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaymen tripped over a large stick and fell
      to the ground yet again, the Troll slowly making his way towards him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Grass and roots leapt up at Drizag’s feet slowing his every step.
      Kaymen grabbed at the stick trying to untangle his legs. But his hands did
      not meet a stick but rather he had tripped upon his bow, the mighty
      Raincaller he had left on the ground before he charged into melee with the
      evil beast. The darkness was beginning to fade some now and light returned
      to his eyes. He could see the snare would not hold the Troll much longer.
      Taking the last few moments he had, he stood, Raincaller in hand and
      commanded the bow to bring down a firestrike upon his enemy. A pillar of
      flame shot from the sky searing the branches of trees as the flames
      plummeted to the earth surrounding Drizag and once again the Troll fell to
      the ground screaming in pain as the flames ignited his flesh. This time
      Kaymen would take no chances, he quickly ran over and grabbed his swords
      and plunged them deep into the Shadowknight’s chest. Drizag’s eyes
      flew open in disbelief the last bit of life drained from his corrupt
      veins.<br>
      <br>
      “Kaylinn has been avenged” Kaymen whispered into the trolls ear.<br>
