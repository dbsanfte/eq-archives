SEER LOG
=====================================================================================

You say, 'unlock memories'
Your heart beat speeds as you recall the Warlord's flaming axe, behind the dark sockets of his helm you sense darker intentions.
You recall meeting with Karana, but the memory is clouded.  You sense that the answer you seek may be in Storms.
You attempt to recall your defeat of Saryrn, but whenever you try to focus you feel a searing pain on your arm.
although it was kind of you to help him, Tylis still seems to have no idea who you are.


You say, 'guided meditation'

The information obtained from Mithaniel is written in a language that you cannot comprehend.
Mithaniel has been bested.  An aura surrounds the mystical symbols that have appeared on your arm.
You have completed all of Honor's Trials. You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls. Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal.  The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.
Thelin has completed his pact with Terris Thule, but has been refused.  The only way to escape his torment now is to destroy Terris Thule.
Milyk has been saved from certain death, but is not recovering.  Only by destroying the ruler of all things pestilent will his curse be lifted.
Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.
The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.
The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.

You have pre and/or post flag issues with Agnarr, Keeper of Sorrows and Terris Thule I believe.

For Agnarr, go to the Grand librarian in PoK and say "what lore".  then go back to the seer.

For the other, start in PoT at Fahlia Shadyglade.  Hail, and say I will go to torment.  Then go back to seer.  In guided meditation she should say something about besting Terris Thule.  Then go back and Hail Tylis and Fahilia.  Then go to the Grand librarian and say what "what lore".  You may need to make trips back to seer to unlock memories between steps.

Rydda Dar.<br /><br />So thinks i...petition..2 days later no response...During this time i also sent an email pleading for help. Finally starting to complain to a guide about lack of response when i recieve a tell from another guide saying ; Your petition has been escalated' as is their usual hotkey.<br /><br />Some small hope blooms...i think not. Anyway this evening i receive this...<br />Greetings <br /><br />This is GM-Admin Drognir. I am sorry to hear about your flag issue.<br />Unfortunately I do not see the Rydda Dar Flag on any of your previous saves<br />and we are not able to add a flag. The only thing I can think of is that<br />you were rolled back to a previous save for some reason (/q or crashed out<br />and didn't properly save, zone/server crashed) or for some reason you did<br />not get the flag (invis, too far from NPC, amount of flags that NPC gives<br />out had been given out, or possibly not in a working raid group in the raid<br />that completed the event). You will need to recomplete that step to acquire<br />the flag.<br /><br />I do wish you well in all your Everquest adventures.<br /><br />&gt; Jesse Ciener<br />&gt; Game Master Drognir<br />&gt; Sony Online Entertainment<br />&gt; <a href="mailto:jciener@soe.sony.com">jciener@soe.sony.com</a><br />&gt; <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">www.everquest.com</a><br /><br />Yes thats right GM asshole. Ill just wander back over to HOH when ive got 5 mins spare and solo Rydda Dar for my flag....u F'ing Tard. (was not my reply incidentally...)<br /><br />Thanks for your prompt reply.<br />Im sorry to say however i dont think this is acceptable. Ive been playing<br />this game for nearly 5 years now and also in Beta. I have paid thousands of<br />dollars for the 4 accounts i run to your company and for the first time I<br />actually need some form of customer service from you and you are saying it<br />is not available.<br />I camped out following this particular raid as i had been online for a<br />number of hours that day and the save should have been automatic. My<br />character was present in the raid and i definately 100% received the text<br />which indicated i received the flag. There was nothing to indicate a<br />role-back the following day as my character was in exactly the same place i<br />had logged him out so I would like something done about this. This is not a<br />simple matter of just doing something again. This event took weeks of<br />planning and involved 60 people in my guild. We are unlikely to want or be<br />able to do it for another month or two and only then with the intention of<br />flagging new guild members. You are not just asking me to put in 20minutes<br />of game time to resolve a fault in your systems, you are in effect saying i<br />need to waste the time of 60 other people to do something again that we have<br />already painstakingly done.<br />If you are not able to do this then i would ask you pass this on to someone<br />who will. Im afraid I will not let this matter lie. I have put thousands of<br />hours and dollars into my accounts with SOE and as a european player get<br />little or no support as it is. This is a simple matter and easily corrected<br />by your technical staff. I would ask on this occasion that the effort is<br />made to resolve this problem positively.<br /><br />Reply...<br /><br />I will forward this email to my supervisor to review, as you have requested.<br />However, we do not grant flags that are not on an account, this is not a<br />choice that I am making on the issue. If the flag was on one of your saves<br />I would be able to restore you to that save.<br /><br /><br />My next mail...<br /><br />I appreciate your hands are tied in this matter which is why I have asked<br />that it is escalated to someone who will be able to make this decision. At<br />the end of the day we are talking trust issues. I hope I am considered<br />valued customer of SOE and have been for some 5 years and would further hope<br />this would at least give credibility to my request. Your records can show<br />that my guild Exhumed, completed this trial event on the day in question.<br />They can also presumably show my attendance online on that day. You will<br />note that we completed ALL three trials that day and BOTH of the other flags<br />are active on this account. One received that same day and one received<br />previously.<br />I can also give you a list of just about everyone else present at the time<br />of this event along with confirmation of who else received flags too.<br />I can see no reason whatsoever that my character did not receive the flag<br />other than a fault with Everquest at the time. I know from experience this<br />isnt the first time it has happened to people and I feel it needs urgent<br />attention. As a player of the game all I can do is follow the rules and<br />instructions correctly which I did on this occasion. It is very unfair to in<br />effect penalise me due to some software problem or glitch.<br />In terms of maintaining game balance this flag is just one tiny piece of a<br />massive flag jigsaw, which is unnessecarily complicated and not very well<br />liked by players in general. So replacing a flag that I have rightly worked<br />for and earned will make no difference whatsoever.<br />I have never had cause to complain about anything before. Despite the recent<br />continued disruption of service, numerous patches and bugs that find their<br />way into the game every time something is supposedly 'improved' I, as with<br />most of the player base have quietly accepted it and will no doubt continue<br />to do so. When something like this comes into question, and very little<br />effort on your part is required to correct the problem then I do expect that<br />the matter is resolved.<br />Many thanks for your help, and I look forward to a response from your<br />supervisor.<br /><br />Additional.<br />I spent some time looking through the logs on my PC today.<br /><br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:23 2004] Targeted (NPC): Trydan Faye<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:23 2004] Right click on the NPC to consider him.<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:24 2004] Gilamas fades away.<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:25 2004] You say, 'Hail, Trydan Faye'<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:25 2004] An ethereal mist descends from the air and<br />surrounds your very being. Your body begins to emanate with the power of<br />Trydan Faye.<br /><br />Im not sure what other information i can give you than this. But this shows<br />what i was saying im my previous email. I hailed the relevant NPC and<br />received the relevant response. I hope this helps.<br /><br />As expected...another negative response.<br /><br />&gt; Greetings <br />&gt;<br />&gt; Please let me introduce myself. My name is Ivan Robancho- Supervisor for<br />&gt; Jesse Ciener with whom you have been corresponding. I am afraid I have<br />bad<br />&gt; news. After reviewing the issue, I see that Mr. Ciener was correct in his<br />&gt; reply. Unless we can verify there is indeed a bug, then we can not assist<br />&gt; with flagging issues. For example, there was an issue where certain<br />players<br />&gt; attempting an event out of order could bar themselves from entering the<br />next<br />&gt; plane. This could be verified because the necessary flags were indeed on<br />&gt; the character-this was a verifiable bug.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; We may be able to assist if a /report was made of the appropriate<br />successful<br />&gt; flagging text after the NPC was hailed.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Unfortunately, in your case, the flag can not be seen in any of our<br />backups<br />&gt; to make the appropriate restore. The only suggestions we can make in this<br />&gt; case is the ones already made by Mr. Ciener. I am sorry that we could not<br />&gt; assist you with this matter.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Sincerely,<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Ivan Robancho<br /><br />And here we go again...<br /><br />Hello, and thank you for your prompt reply.<br /><br />Im sorry to say but i do not find this a reasonable response. It is a<br />problem with the system and how it saves the game which has caused this<br />problem so i do not see how i can verify the bug other than by providing the<br />information i have already given you. My character logs are quite clear in<br />this matter.<br /><br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:23 2004] Targeted (NPC): Trydan Faye<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:23 2004] Right click on the NPC to consider him.<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:24 2004] Gilamas fades away.<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:25 2004] You say, 'Hail, Trydan Faye'<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:25 2004] An ethereal mist descends from the air and<br />surrounds your very being. Your body begins to emanate with the power of<br />Trydan Faye.<br /><br />This is not disputable. If your saved positions showed me having this flag<br />then I wouldnt have to contact you at all as it wouldnt be an issue. If<br />there isnt a bug please explain to me exactly what this information above<br />means, because for everyone else on the raid who did exactly the same thing<br />as me and recieved the same response it meant they received the flag. I have<br />provided you with proof that I did what was needed and got the flag and yet<br />a day later it is not registered on my account. So I would like to know what<br />exactly does this constitute other than a bug?<br />I didnt do a /report at the time as I didnt expect there to be a problem. It<br />seems from now on I have to do this. I imagine you will be recieving a lot<br />of /reports as I will be instructing my 100 or so guildmembers to do exactly<br />the same every time we gain another flag.<br />This does not get away from the fact that im giving you the information<br />showing i received the flag, so what I expect now is not a corporate<br />response on how you cant help me. I expect the flag put on the character as<br />it should be. I know this is within your power to help me and under the<br />circumstances and due to the information i have given you can see no valid<br />reason why it is not done straight away.<br /><br />sincerely<br /><br />and again.... can u believe...<br /><br />Greetings <br /><br />I am afraid that because we can not verify the flag being set, there is not<br />much we can do other than to make the suggestions that were made to you<br />already. While logs that are saved on your system may aid you in clarifying<br />certain things, we do not accept them as a viable means of verification.<br /><br />Again, I am sorry this could not have been a more favorable resolve.<br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Ivan Robancho <br /><br /><br />So here we go...<br /><br /><br />So what you are basically saying to me is that its quite possible im lying<br />and you are not willing therefore to act on the information im giving you?<br />Im absolutely astounded. To think that you can pay a company every month for<br />5 years for them to provide a service to then have it suggested that you<br />might be lying when trying to resolve such a simple problem.<br />So please tell me exactly which of the two following statements you agree<br />with so I can decide what to action to take next.<br /><br />1) You think the logs are false and wont act on them. (in other words you<br />are suggesting that i fraudulently produced them and that I am lying in my<br />emails to you. Why else would they not be sufficient verification?)<br /><br />or<br /><br />2) You know that the logs confirm what ive been trying to tell you all along<br />and are refusing to act on this. /report will only show you the information<br />that is in my logs anyway. The last 10 lines of information relevant to that<br />particular character.<br /><br />If SOE think that I will back down and let it go at this you are very much<br />mistaken. Your company has an agreement to provide me with service for which<br />I pay substantial yearly fees. You are not providing this service. The<br />product is faulty. I have provided you with a full and clear explanation<br />along with proof of the problem I am having and you are refusing to resolve<br />the matter with no good reason. Despite how safely worded your reply is the<br />message seems very clear and I do not like the suggestion one bit.<br /><br />I would ask this is passed onto your superior immediately. I am contactable<br />on the following number ** between 8am PST to 3pm PST (11pm<br />GMT). I expect a phone call from your superior to explain exactly why my<br />proof is not sufficient for you when clearly it is the only proof that could<br />be available in this situation. I also want a full explanation as to why<br />something that really shouldnt be such a problem to sort out has had to go<br />this far.<br /><br />Further to this I will be seriously considering what to do about continuing<br />to use your services. There seems little point paying for something that im<br />clearly not going to recieve. In addition if i dont feel you are at least<br />making some small effort to help me I will also be passing on full details<br />of my concerns and your lack of help to as many gaming magazines as I can in<br />order to warn others of what they may be getting themselves into by signing<br />up. I dont want to go this route but i feel very strongly about all of this.<br />If the situation were reversed and I asked you to spend 120 hours doing<br />again a job you had already done to the best of your ability and done<br />correctly im sure you would be incredibly indignant to say the least.<br /><br />Sincerely<br /></span></font></td>

Please could you get back to<br />me as soon as possible.<br />I would also ask that you look into this matter thoroughly. I have already<br />received two standard corporate responses and to be perfectly straight with<br />you that is not what I want to hear. If all we can expect to get from your<br />staff as customers is a standard corporate response you may as well put in<br />automated response emails as there seems little point in them being<br />answererd by actual humans at all.<br />Ive raised a very valid concern over problems with the game resulting in my<br />lack of character progression. Ive spent the last couple of weeks talking to<br />people in my guild and our allied guild and this is happening CONSTANTLY. I<br />have asked that my guildmembers all do /report every time they get a flag<br />but this is isnt really good enough, especially after the problem has<br />affected so many already. The point is, there is a problem. It needs to be<br />accepted as being a problem, investigated and sorted out. I posted my<br />concerns on a few class message boards and received TONS of replies from<br />people saying they had exactly the same problem.<br />Most whilst being extremely disappointed by this have basically said they<br />dont expect that SOE will do anything about it so are resigned to doing the<br />flags again. Its not very encouraging to hear from a good section of your<br />playerbase that they have no faith in your customer service and dont believe<br />you will be interested in sorting out problems with the game when they<br />occur.<br />So I will ask again what I have asked before. I have provided you with proof<br />as best I can do. I cant turn back time and do a /report on an event that<br />has already happened and believe me had I known the extend of this problem I<br />would have done it immediately.<br />Since this event I have completed the rest of the flags I was missing so now<br />Rydda Dar is the only thing stopping me from joining my guild in the planes.<br />Yes we are capable of doing this event again but that is far from the point.<br />It requires a lot of planning and a lot of time from 60 players and that is<br />just not fair to expect from any of them when this event is currently not<br />needed by anyone else in the guild except me due to a problem with your<br />systems. So please look into this and help me out.<br />I look forward to your reply.<br /><br />Sincerely<br /><br /><br /><br />And the reply!!!!<br /><br />Hello <br /><br />I apologize for the delay. I have read your correpondences with Mr. Ciener<br />and Mr. Robancho. First of all, I would like to point out that we receive<br />many requests from customers claiming that they did not receive flags.<br />Whether they are valid or invalid, we are limited with resources to identify<br />precise information on flagging. We are working to improve our tools, so we<br />can easily resolve flagging issues. <br /><br />Our policy is pretty simple. If we are unable to verify it through our<br />logs, then we are unable to act upon a request. However, in your case I<br />will make an exception. Before I can act on your situation, I will need<br />some more information regarding your flag event. Please provide the<br />following:<br /><br />1) When (time/date) was this flag event?<br />2) How many players were involved in this raid?<br />3) After you defeated the NPC, what did you do exactly?<br /><br />As soon as I receive the above information, I will work diligently and<br />promptly to come up with a solution. Thank you for your patience and I<br />apologize for this inconvenience.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Satao Minami<br />Customer Service Manager<br />Sony Online Entertainment<br /><br /><br />And my reply....hmm is this looking promising?<br /><br />Thank you for your prompt reply.<br /><br />The date of the raid was the Third of January 2004. Approximate time of the<br />start of the raid was 11.10pm GMT. I believe that is plus 8 hours on PST.<br />The hail was done at 25mins past midnight and 25 seconds GMT according to my<br />logs.<br />We had also completed the other two trials in HOH this evening. One of which<br />my character Dhur was present at and received the flag. That flag was saved<br />so should show up on your logs.<br />There was around 53 people in the raid in total. This should have been made<br />up of something like 48 people from my guild Exhumed. 2-3 guildless people<br />(applicants of our guild) and a couple of people from our allies The<br />Relentless.<br />When Rydda Dar was killed I hailed the mob. This is the text from my logs.<br /><br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:23 2004] Targeted (NPC): Trydan Faye<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:23 2004] Right click on the NPC to consider him.<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:24 2004] Gilamas fades away.<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:25 2004] You say, 'Hail, Trydan Faye'<br />[Sat Jan 03 00:25:25 2004] An ethereal mist descends from the air and<br />surrounds your very being. Your body begins to emanate with the power of<br />Trydan Faye.<br /><br />I didnt do anything else after this until Amardu(i believe) cast Area Effect<br />Translocation to Bind spell. I zoned and then camped out immediately due to<br />it being very late.<br /><br />If theres any other information I have that might be of use to you please<br />feel free to ask and I will do my best to get it to you straight away.<br /><br />Sincerely<br /><br />Reply... <img src="images/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" border="0" alt="" title="" align="middle" /><br /><br />Hello <br /><br />We normally do not issue out flags without verification; however, I will<br />give you the benefit of the doubt. In the future, we will need<br />verification. The best way to provide us with verification is to use the<br />/report command during the hailing process. In addition, after obtaining<br />your flags, please make sure that you zone out or wait several minutes so<br />that our system will save your character information.<br /><br />We will correct this problem as soon as possible. You should have your flag<br />on your character shortly. Thank you for your patience and we apologize for<br />any inconveniences this may have caused you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Satao Minami<br />Customer Service Manager<br />Sony Online Entertainment <br /><br /><img src="images/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" border="0" alt="" title="" align="middle" /><br /></span></font></td>

Once he killed Tylis will become targetable and you can talke with him by doing so you will get your raid teleported to Keeper of Sorrow area.

TT and Bertie kill are correct according to their specific message (also a prerequisite).<br />now i checked my journal and no preflag mob listed. i am afraid i didnt hail him, just /say blabla to get the port out. stupid nec. did you check your journal?<br /><br />now i went on the next saryns raid. and should i tell you what? preflag mob wasnt up because 1 of 4 trigger mobs missing. now i got 2 saryns flags without preflag. shit happens.<br /><br />i never thought it was SoEs mistake. 1st i searched until i found what my mistake may have been. and even if, if they got no entry in their logs, they cant proof you are not faking. its such simple. again, shit happens.<br /><br />Usul</span></font></td>
