        <font color="white" face="Verdana" size="2"> I've been playing EQ since on the summer of 2000, and got into it... I thought to myself, I had a game to play 'cause I find myself a nocturnal person, and most of my irl friends are sleeping... But sometimes I wake up in the afternoons turn on my computer and then *BOOM* connect to the internet, and then click on the EQ icon...</P><P>I let my best friends play it, hoping he'd get into it, and play it with me... He said it was boring, and couldn't figure out anything, and I tried to explain to him that once you learn the controlls it's easy riding, and fun roleplaying...</P><P>My brother plays it once in awhile and told me once he got a new comp (I use his 'cuz mine is lame) and he'd get his own copy and play with me.</P><P>Now I'm trying to get my girlfriend into it...Sometimes, I find perfect days to go over to her house, or even call her... Now I find myself calling her sometimes I stop playing from 6 to 11:30pm to talk with her. I'm also trying to get her into the game, so we could do something together, besides just hang out and talk and stuff. Now I find myself addicting, and I'm trying to take time time off of the game (2 days every weekend to do something with my girlfriend, or friends) I think I'm doing pretty well, but I think it's going to make me afraid to loose my love, and my good friends who I've tried to get into the game, like my friend Zack who plays AD&D, and Diablo 2, but wont play EQ...He says it 'Takes too long to lvl up' I tell him that's the fun in it...You meet new people, new things, new areas to explore, I only made it up to lvl 20 on my Iksar Monk only lurking around Swamp of No Hope, Crush Bone, Greater Faydark, Steamfont, Field of Bones, and Lake Ill Omen.</P><P><BR>I think I've lost the time and effert to play, and level up, My necro is now at 15, and I'm starting to hate FoB, my ranger is 11, and can't level very well in CB (damn f00k1k camps infrot of the castle) and it just pisses me off, I think they should make the smaller (9 20ish) zones abit bigger, so they shouldn't be overcrowed...</P><P>Anyways, back to what I was saying...</P><P>My girlfriend thinks I'm not spending too much time with her, and my love is sick, so when she called me the other day and told me, I quit playing EQ at a fast rate, camped out whevever I had to, and drove over to her house just to baby her :P (Heh, I'm one of them soft, caring loving, emmotional type goth guys...sorry, I don't *BITE* like the press says we do...)</P><P>Hell, I even took in joing a medeval re-inacting group, insted of playing EQ all the time, and my EQ friends say I level slowly then they do...I just play the game whenever I get a chance just to have fun. :)</P><P><BR>But I'm starting to think wether I should quit for awhile, and hang out with my friends, or just play whenever freetime I have possiable... The game is getting so addicting, my mom thinks I'm starting to be anti-social and truth is, I'm semi-anti-social. Unpopular, have very few friends, not really good with girls, but who cares? I sure do...But I've been out with my girlfriend for almost half a year, and I don't want to destory something I've worked hard for, and always wanted...love...(I have a phobia of being alone; not being loved by another person, not just by family members)</P><P><BR>And this summer, I was going to try to get my necro a high level, and then stop for awhile, but my girlfriend's parents invited me to down to Branson, MO (Missouri, USA is where I pretty much live... I've only met 3 people that play EQ in MO, a girl, and 2 guys that do the re-inacting thing with me. Ken, if you're reading this you're a good swordsmen, thanks for teaching me some techniques!)</P><P>But, I was looking for some advice...I'm trying to get my friends into the game, to see how much fun I am having, besides playing AD&D and console RPG's all the time, they want an RPG with a storyline, they can't make their own storyline up...My girlfriend isn't really all into gaming, but I wanted to be with her online and offline...)</P><P>Anyways, I hope someone repiles...thanks!!!!!!!!</P><P></P><P></P><P>To be, or not to be...<BR>...What was the question again?</font></td>

         You've been playing for nearly 2 whole years now and your highest guy is around level 20?  If that's the case you don't have a problem with EQ at all.  I have only been playing maybe 2.5 years, have a 60 mage, 51 necro and a few more 40+ toons.  I just quit the other day because I was really starting to have some of the same problems you listed or had already gone through them.  Just ask yourself what you find most rewarding in life.  For me, I chose a meaningful relationship in the end over my "virtual friends".  I did totally loose contact with all my other real life/non EQ related friends when I got into EQ so much, not that I really regret that part.  EQ will die before long, many people are going to be left hanging with no social life/skills.  My advice is get out while you can if your having any troubles such as these.</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=236080" target="_blank">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=236080</a><a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         EQ is only a game, and can be played anytime. But friends or a girlfriend are not always going to be there.

         Jester, a lot of people don't realize when it can start to become 'more harm than good'.  Everyone has an easy addiction to something or another. Long as you realize what your easy addiction is and either 1) Control it and continue it, or 2) simply cut it off and find something else.<BR>I'm a pretty firm believer in not jumping the gun on saying, "You're an EQ addict! You should stop cause you're gonna die from it!" or some other rediculous non-sensical thing to that effect. However, from your post, it sounds less like you're addicted to EQ and more into the making yourself happy thing. (You like logging on to EQ cause you have friends here, can do fun things in the game, and get a kick out of leveling up/finding new gear/socializing) Hey, that's great and cool.. but I get this nagging feeling after reading your post that you may just be feeling like you need to spend more time with your girlfriend. If that's what you wanna do, go for it. Don't bother with EQ for a while. Maybe ever again. Either way you go, it's not like it's a one time choice. You can log into EQ tommorow, or a year from now. It'll be there. (or EQ2, etc) For now, go hang out with your girlfriend for a solid week or two and see how that goes. Don't try to get others into EQ, and in fact, don't even bring it up and try hard not to think about it. Really let yourself get pulled into something else. Go to a themepark, take her out to the Movies a few times, eat at a new resturaunt, go play Mini-golf with her.. buy some old board games and see how much fun they can be (silly trivia games are great). Discover (or invent) new sex toys! Just do something else for a while and in a few weeks, if you're bored sometime, log onto EQ and goof off. That's what it was for in the first place. <img src=icon_smile.gif border=0 align=middle></P><P></P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205091" target="_blank"><font color=red><font size=5>Ashtaroth Solarium</font id=size5></font id=red></a><BR><i>Nec-Romancer of Innoruuk</i><BR><i>Legends of the Realm</i><a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         I myself have been playing EQ since summer 2000.  When the question comes up, "Am I playing too much?" - then you need to turn the PC off and take a break.  At times I was playing about 40-50 hours a week (as much time as I spent at work).  Then I realized that my prioities were skewed and took about 4 months away and came back when I knew I could play for a couple hours and log off.  EQ is a source of stress relief from a long day at the office and a nice escape.  When it becomes more than that - then it becomes a problem.  My friends still play hard core - <i>and hell they have kids</i>.  Find a balance that you can live with - real life is an exciting adventure and we should all enjoy it while we can.</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         I can go for weeks without playing.  It’s a game, it’s a game designed to suck the life out of people who find the incredibly easy success in the game addictive.  It takes four years of hard dedicated work to succeed in college and not just get by, for example, it takes two months of dedicated hard work to reach level 60 and be “someone” in EverQuest.  That sounds like some pretty addictive alternative reality go-go juice or crack to me.   No, I’m not insulting anyone, but EverQuest tends to attract the same type of person who’d say utter bullshit like this, “I’m thirty, a millionaire, married to a super model, and I spend tremendous amounts of time with my children.  Oh and I also spent 70 hours raiding this week with my four level 60 toons.”   </P><P>Just saying.</P><P><BR><center>The 3yr old level 51 Necro...<img src=icon_smile_clown.gif border=0 align=middle><BR>The caster balancing is going really well for us Necromancers.<BR><font color=blue>Think about the word THONG.</font id=blue><BR></center><a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         Do what you want and what makes you happy.  It sounds like you don't really have a pretty good balance of that going on now.  However, you want to hear that you should play more EQ and that is what I am here to tell you to do.  Friends will come and go throughout your life as will girls.  More than once will you be hurt by both of them.  Enjoy yourself to the fullest. You only have one life to live, do you want do live it for yourself or for others?  Personnaly, I choose to do what ever makes me happy.  So, if others do not understand you or respect you for doing what makes you happy...Big deal.  You honestly don't care and should not.  Quit being Co-Dependant and live life for yourself for a change.  Find that happy medium between life and crack and just chill there :)<BR>Bottom line, always be true to yourself.</P><P>Morgrym Boneblack: Necromancer<BR>Primus Exodus: Veeshan<BR>Evil By Choice:  Being Bad Just Feels To Damn Good<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
