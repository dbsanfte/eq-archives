        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">I know this info is out there somewhere, but I couldn't find it boiled down to just what matters to us Necros...so I did some cut-n-pasting.</P><P><b>Luclin Alternate Advancement Necromancer Skill Tree</b></P><P><b><u>Unlocking Archetypes and Class Abilities:</u></b></P><P>There are three types of Alternate Abilities: General, Archetype and Class Abilities. Each is a stepping stone for the next. Attaining a certain number of General abilities is required before you can learn any abilities from your Archetype. Similarly, you will have to attain a prerequisite number of abilities from your Archetype to start gaining abilities from your Class group. There are also level requirements for each of these levels. Keep in mind that you can't gain any of these abilities unless you own Shadows of Luclin.</P><P>These requirements are in addition to any prerequisites needed for some abilities.</P><P>General abilities: A character must be level 51 or higher to open up the General abilities.<BR>Archetype abilities: A character must have spent six skill points on General abilities and be 55th level or higher to open up the Archetype abilities.<BR>Class abilities: A character must have spent twelve skill points on Archetype abilities and be 59th level or higher to open up the Class abilities.</P><P><b><u>Skill Levels and skill points:</u></b></P><P>Once you have gained enough experience points toward alternate advancement (enough to fill the experience bar) you will earn one skill point. It is these skill points that allow you to purchase alternate advancement abilities. Each ability will require a certain number of skill points to purchase one skill level with that ability.</P><P>Every ability available through the Alternate Advancement system has a skill level associated with it. For many of these abilities there is only one skill level, meaning that once you purchase the ability you have attained all the skill available for that ability. But several abilities have more than one skill level. Gaining a second or third (or more) skill level in an ability will improve that ability. However, it is important to note that a second skill level is usually more costly than the first, and the third more costly than the second. That expense is rewarded, however. If additional skill levels cost more, the skill level also means a greater increase in the power of that ability.</P><P><b><u>General Abilities</u></b></P><P>The General abilities are available to any character level 51 and above that has the Shadows of Luclin expansion. All General Abilities are Passive.</P><P>Every skill level for every General ability costs one skill point.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Strength</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Strength by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Stamina</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Stamina by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Agility</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Agility by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Dexterity</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Dexterity by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Intelligence</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Intelligence by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Wisdom</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Wisdom by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Charisma</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base Charisma by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Fire Resistance</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to fire by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Cold Resistance</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to cold by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Magic Resistance</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to magic by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Poison Resistance</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to poison by two points.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Disease Resistance</b>: (5 skill levels) - Each skill level with this ability increases the character's base resistance to disease by two points.</P><P><b>First Aid</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the maximum percentage of healing that the character can grant using the Bind Wound skill. The first skill level will increase the maximum by 10%, the second by 20% and the third by 30%.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Run Speed</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level will increase the character's base run speed. This increase only adds to the character's natural running speed, it will not function with any other speed increase such as Spirit of Wolf or riding a horse.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Lung Capacity</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the time that the character can hold his breath. The first skill level improves lung capacity by 10%, the second by 25% and the third by 50%.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Metabolism</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the character's need for food and water. The first skill level reduces the consumption of food by 10%, the second by 25% and the third by 50%.</P><P><b>Improved Natural Regeneration</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the character's ability to heal. Each skill level increases the character's base regeneration by one point every six seconds.</P><P><BR><b><u>Caster Archetype Abilities</u></b></P><P>Abilities from this Archetype are available to Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers and Wizards, as well as Bards and Shadowknights. The first skill level of each Archetype ability costs two skill points. The second skill level of each Archetype ability costs four skill points. The third skill level of each Archetype ability costs six skill points. All Archetype abilities are passive.</P><P><b>Channeling Focus</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the chances of spell interruption due to damage or movement. The first skill level reduces the chance of interruption but 5%, the second skill level increases the reduction to 10% and the third brings the reduction to 15%.</P><P><b>Mental Clarity</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the character's ability to recover mana. Each skill level increases the character's base mana recovery by one point every six seconds.</P><P><b>Spell Casting Deftness</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the casting time for beneficial spells with a casting time greater than four seconds. The first skill level reduces the casting time of these beneficial spells by 5%, the second skill level increases the reduction to 15% and the third brings the decrease to 25%. Bards can not gain this Archetype Ability because they do not have 'casting times' over four seconds.</P><P><b>Spell Casting Expertise</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level negates any chance of spell failure (fizzle) for spells of a certain level. The first skill level prevents failure of spells under 20th level, the second skill level prevents failure of spells under 35th level and the third prevents failure of spells under 52nd level.</P><P><b>Spell Casting Fury</b>: (3 skill levels) - Gives the caster the ability to do 'critical' damage with direct damage spells. Each skill level increases the chance to do critical damage with a direct damage spell. The first skill level gives a 2% chance for critical damage, the second increases the chance to 4% and the third increases the change to 7%.</P><P><b>Spell Casting Mastery</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill increases the caster's chance of successfully using his specialization skill for the spell he is casting. This works for all spell types. The result is a reduced chance of spell failure (fizzle) and a greater chance of a reduction of the mana cost for the spell. The increase in the caster's chance to successfully use his specialization is 5% for the first skill level, 15% for the second skill level and 30% for the third skill level. Hybrids can not gain this ability because they do not have the specialization skill.</P><P><b>Spell Casting Reinforcement</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the duration of caster's "buff" spells. The first skill level increases the duration of buffs by 5%, the second raises the increase to 15% and the third raises the increase to 30%. The only Caster that can gain this ability are Enchanters.</P><P><b>Spell Casting Subtlety</b>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the amount of attention casting spells generates for the caster. The first skill level reduces the amount of 'hate' generated by spell casting by 5%, the second skill level improves the 'hate' reduction to 10% and the third improves the 'hate' reduction to 20%.</P><P><BR><b><u>Necromancer Class Abilities</u></b></P><P><b>Call to Corpse</b>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability gives the Necromancer the power to summon a corpse without the use of components or memorization of a spell. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time).</P><P><b>Dead Mesmerization</b>: (1 skill level - cost 3 skill points) - This ability gives the Necromancer the power to confuse undead in an area without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of mana.

The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time).</P><P><b>Dire Charm</b>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability allows the Necromancer to charm an NPC without fear that the NPC will break the charm (charm will end only when the Necromancer leaves the zone or logs out) without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of mana. All of the usual restriction for charm spells apply to this ability as well, except in regards to duration. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time).</P><P><b>Fearstorm</b>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Necromancer the power to cause fear to all within an area.

This ability will allow the Necromancer to turn meat items (chunk of meat, gator meat, etc) into bone chips without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of mana.

The Refresh Timer for this ability is 7 seconds (less than one second of game time).</P><P><b>Innate Invisibility to Undead</b>: (1 skill level - cost 3 skill points) - This ability gives the Cleric the power become invisible to undead without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of mana. The Refresh Timer on this ability is 7 seconds (less than one second of game time).</P><P><b>Lifeburn</b>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability gives the Necromancer the power to convert his own life force into power and direct that power at his.

It also places a life bond effect on the Necromancer that does 250 points of damage for six 'ticks'. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 144 minutes (two days of game time).</P><P><b>Mass Group Buff</b>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability gives the Necromancer the power to make his next group buff spell into an area of affect spell. The spell would benefit everyone in the area, not just the caster's group. This Ability causes the spell to use up to as much as twice as much mana. It will require at least the normal casting cost, and will use up to as much as twice the mana if the caster has that much available. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time).</P><P><b>Mend Companion</b>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Necromancer the power to completely heal his own pet. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 144 minutes (two days of game time).</P><P><b>Pet Discipline</b>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability allows the Necromancer to better control his pet. The command "/pet hold" will prevent the pet from attacking any foe, even if that foe attacks the pet or its master. The pet will remain passive until given another command.</P><P></P><P>--Nergal Teir'Draconis, Children of the Phoenix (Tunare)</font></td>
