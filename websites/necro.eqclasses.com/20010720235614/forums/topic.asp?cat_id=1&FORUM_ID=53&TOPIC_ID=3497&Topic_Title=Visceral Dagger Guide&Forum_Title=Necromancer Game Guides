        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Each of the camps can be done at 44 solo I found. We will start at the top of the dungeon and work down. I am assuming some familiarity with the zone, so excuse me if I state things that are not clear. If you have a monk friend after some Crescent have him come along, but if he is lower level than you, or does not have a range weapon, you will be pulling.</P><P>I had the following spells memmed in this order<BR>Dooming Darkness<BR>Shock of Poison (Could go with ignite but takes more mana, and my evo sucks still)<BR>Drain Spirit<BR>VoS (I like this for speed, could choose another - note I didn't use pet in church some times so Asytotle wasn't used)<BR>Screaming Terror (Get two take one out of the fight)<BR>Call of Bones, or Pet buff. (in lab I put up Harmshield. YMMV)<BR>Vampiric Curse<BR>Feign Death</P><P>With this I cycled buffs out as needed, seldomly used steelskin, never diamondskin.</P><P>On the map room 8 is the room that the Imprecator spawns at. He shows up in the cubby on the south side of the room. There are three spawns in here, and a wanderer that comes in seldomly. Before you set up in any room, walk through the area invis and look around. To clear room 8 (which is the hardest to clear and split) You should set up in room 6 (called the bedroom).</P><P>There are a few spawns in here, but geting set up is not too hard. They will be green. Once set up pull the mobs one by one from the Imprecator room. I used darkness to pull almost always, it was resisted 8 times total in my 3 days in Dalnir. Once set up in room, it's just up to you to split the spawns as you need, and wait on imprecator. This one is camped more generally while people wait on lumpys and so the hilt may be easy. He also spawns more often it seems. Leaving to sell is a matter of gating, or going invis and running out.</P><P>Next is Church and Blacksmith. I put these together cause I did this part without a pet, and it is surprising how easy it was, perhaps due to some strange behavior on the part of the blacksmith. The blacksmith may be camped as people will want a robe of the Foci or what not. If not just pull the spawn farthest from you in room 10. Use invis to run around. Pull him back a bit to kill, one of the flying sperm teeth things may be roaming, I never had to deal with them though. If the blacksmith is up, he will see you through normal invis, run back to the area where you should be set up for church, and sit. He seems to teleport there to attack you, or did at least three times to me. If not, dark him and run back to church set up area.</P><P>For the church and Undead Blacksmith you want to set up in the little niche between the church (room 12) and room 11. This is a fairly safe place and if you get too low, invis (or hide if a dark-elf - test by conning something when hidden) to rest here.</P><P>I didn't use a pet here much, and would seldomly swith spell 7 with root, to let dots kill them, but I am a masochist and took the pain. Anyway, in church there are three mobs + a wanderer you want to kill (see a pattern yet?) The wanderer wanders the hall from room 11 to room 12. Make sure he is dead before your next pull. Spells used to kill are dark, run to back wall of the niche, and start casting VoS. It will hit before they get to you. These two alone are almost enough to kill the mobs. I added vamp curse, and drain spirit for fun.</P><P>In the church what you want to do is cast invis, walk to the entrance area of church. Facing the altar back against the wall. Target the mob on the left side (first one) and pull with darkness. Kill same as above, and med/heal, get next one on left. </P><P>To pull the one behind altar (imprecator place holder) takes a bit of work, but once done is easy. You can invis, run into the room, and target, run out, and then pull, using above tactic. The other is if you want to use a pet, how you will pull. Use ctrl key to strafe with back against wall until the three mobs on the right can not be seen. Press F8 to target mob in front arc. Strafe to left a bit to see if it is one of the mobs on the right. If not you should have imp ph targeted. Cast darkness to pull, run back to pet start casting VoS, and kill as i am sure you have learned to do.</P><P>Caution: The reason I didn't use pet much is that he is low enough for the other mobs to aggro if they see him. Be sure to have pet back off macroed on your current hotkey bank. If a caster casts on you, slam that hotkey as soon after it hits you as you can. You do not want your pet running to where the other mobs can see him, it will aggro them all.</P><P>Next is the Lab room left (or east) side near #17. Setting up here was fun, I had harmshield up just in case (you can run straight out the exit in time I found =P). In the area by the water before you get into the carved rooms area park your pet. Wait for a wanderer walking down the long hall towards you, pull with dark, lay the smack down. There should be two of them wandering, but split a bit. You may have to move into the hall (stay near center) to pull another, again, make sure pet stays outside he will aggro extras. After the wanderers are down run to the 17 on the map turn to your left (east) and target the mob you can see. This is the imprecator ph. Dark, run to pet and just wait. He will come eventually and hit you and aggro pet. Lay the necro smack down on this one also. when ready run into room where you pulled the last one (have pet follow, but don't wait for him). A mob is there on the west side and just cast on him, or walk up to him till he hits you, pet will show up, and having taken fastest route (They run when you get hit) should not aggro anything. Kill it and have pet guard here. You have a total of 3 mobs to kill here, and it should be fairly safe at 44. Once you have all the pieces run to room 18 put stuff in forge and click combine. Yay! Visceral Dagger.</P><P>I never got chased out, but did die a few times (twice I think) to errors on my part, but only in the church. Common errors were pulling another from church close to the wanderer spawning. The spawn time seemed to be 12 minutes here, and if a wanderer is showing in a few minutes, and you are thinking of pulling that one last mob in the church, just hold it. You can single pull them, and there is no reason to place undue risk into the equation. The most risk is involved in splitting the upstairs shackle room I found. Church, and the downstairs lab were pretty easy to split. Long camp times meant running to sell several times. If you get lucky you will get your pieces quickly, and a few of the nicer drops in the dungeon perhaps. If you have any questions, feel free to email me.</P><P><a href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm" target="_blank">http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm</a></P><P><BR>Edited by - tarraagorn hellraiser on 03/09/2001  17:11:17</font></td>

We set up in the crypt room -- you can get two non-aggro nibblers to spawn here. There is usually one nibbler in there when you start, we killed the second spawn in our rotation of the church spawns until it came up a nibbler.</P><P>Summoned and augmented a pet, and I kept my own buffs spaced at 15 minutes for ease of renewal. Had root, lifetap, vamp curse, Screaming Terror, Asystole, renew bones, augment death, and FD memmed. Would swap out random spells in the augment slot as nescesary.</P><P>With your pet in the crypt room, you can almost always run back to the boner before the caster mobs will toss a nuke your way because of the intervening wall, AND you have more time to spam Pet Back Off before he aggros the rest of the church. Normal single pull of greens, but since the monkey was only level 29 they were all good experience for him. Root, back the pet off and ST, let the monkey finish them to get the exp plus the dungeon bonus :></P><P>Recently the crescent armor drops have been reduce to a tiny trickle, which is rather unfortunate. However, ever since then I always try to take a friend's alt with me on long camps, gets them levels and gives me someone to talk with.</P><P>-- <BR>Life is a zero sum game, the only way to win is not to play.</P><P>Edited by - Israfel on 03/23/2001  16:41:26<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">I did my dagger at 44. First imprecator was easy, spawned after 2 PHs and dropped nice robe of dalnir with dagger piece  =) Breaking his room was easy, I parked my pet right outside a hole in a wall from drop down room, and single pulled things out for augmented pet to kill. </P><P>Church was tricky. Key was to make sure that roamer in a hall where one way door is, is not aggro. Have FD memmed, wait till that sperm of death or goo shows up, and just sit <img src=icon_smile.gif border=0 align=middle>  If it proceeds to beat the poop out of you, feign, then stand up, root and kill. Remember, wandering mobs NEVER forget FD. If you want them to forget you, you have to  /q out and log back in. Once you got non aggro spawn there, set up your pet in that big room before one way door, dont set up in that small room closer to church. Once you get attacked, pet will rush in and train you.  Usually non aggro sperms and goos are kept alive by everyone who passes by. They will still scowl, but will ignore you. </P><P>Pull things out with darkness, and rush back to pet. Root the mob once at pet, and med. Pet will rip it to shreds. Continue pulling them one by one. Casters (channeler and Evoker) can do some decent damage, get lifetap ready. Shaman mobs will try to slow your pet, and they might heal mobs through walls, watch out. </P><P>Lab area breakin for me was pretty much killing every mob on the way there from entrance to that place.  Set up where water meets ground, park pet there, clean out all kly. Weird pathing bug will make all mobs appear to be stuck at first doorway you will see, and for some reason they can still hurt you, even non casters. Pet will aggro, cause a gigantic train, watch out. after you cleared out up to lab, go inside lab, park pet as far as you can away from the door and wait. That room has 2 spawns, either can be imprecator. Dont let pet get out of the door. If you let him, FEIGN right away, because you WILL die if you dont feign.</P><P>Good luck on this.</P><P>Flatin Shadowmaster<BR>Sexiest Gnome Heretic ever<BR>Proud member of L`Malla<BR>Druzzil Ro server<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

(and because I'm a luff head at times had to go BACK for the stupid hammer)</P><P>Anyway.... Overseer or whatever had spawned and my folks wanted to zone out... </P><P>So thinking I had the 49 pet uber buffed and all... I sent him in... the whole room agroed and my party was in the dining room.  We created a nice little train on which I had to gate my ass out of and the Pally ( he's a friend... but even friends can be silly)got nuked.</P><P>I was intrigued how a room full of greenies... after being agroed by the pet... all come after me then the other folks.  </P><P>So... the Overseer room... if done wrong (like I did) can hurt.</P><P>*dancing QUEEN!*</P><P>Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">My new dagger and I thank you for the great guide.  No problem at 45.</P><P>Notes...</P><P>The Imprecator on the second floor shows up in the cubby on the west side of the room, not the south side.</P><P>I used a pet to save a bit on mana, and it worked pretty well.  Pull with darkness, /pet attack, watch the show.  Thanks to the recent aggro changes, once mobs were on the pet they pretty much ignored me, letting me meditate in peace.  Getting the best pet helped <b>a lot</b>.  The lowest pet could get pretty banged up by the casters, and the two lowest pets didn't kill things quickly enough for my liking.</P><P>Getting non-aggro roamers on the third floor helps a lot in the church/blacksmith area.</P><P>Church area gave me some bad pulls for no apparent reason.  Pet was a couple of rooms back, in the crypt room or the room beyond that around the corner, so that wasn't it.  I could single pull the church pretty reliably, but one evening it was the 5-for-1 special over and over.  Weird.  I also couldn't pull singles from the altar area without clearing the main area first, so I had to keep the whole church clear.  Which wasn't a problem, I just didn't have time to do the Blacksmith at the same time.</P><P>Only one death, when I discovered that the invokers can chain cast a 250-point DD when they're in the mood.  I stayed over half health after that.</P><P>When I set up in the lab, the only time I aggro'd the hall wanderer was when the bookcase mob showed up as a caster and my pet fought him right at the doorway.  Two at a time wasn't a problem.</P><P>Second floor piece took about half an hour, Blacksmith about two hours, church maybe six to eight hours over a couple of evenings, and lab another six to eight over a couple of days.  It can feel long waiting for specific drops, but it's not bad at all compared to some of the other silly quests out there.</P><P>Even if you don't get the piece you need in a particular camp, you don't go home empty-handed.  I typically went to the bank after each camp session with about 200 pp in platinum, gold, and fine steel.  I also averaged about two to three "bonus" drops per session, including a Sarnak Emblazened Tabard, Ketchata Koro Mis, Robe of the Foci, and the left-handed claw thing.  I think I also saw about two full sets of Crescent rot because there were either no monks, or the monks wouldn't come to the third floor to get it.  (Don't they sell invisibility potions in Cabilis?)</P><P>All in all, a fun time and a nice upgrade.</P><P><b>Morty Undercrypt</b>, Keeper of the <font color=red>NecroGnomicon</font id=red><BR><small>"Whoops, was I supposed to be taking names too?"</small><BR>E'ci<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
