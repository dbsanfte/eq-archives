        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Yes, I realize the Coterie mask isn't the biggest issue really, but I think there is something that still needs to be done.  They wasted peoples time and plat and then retronerfed it into a mid-30s item at best.</P><P>So, considering that, this is what I sent to Developer's Corner regarding the mask.  It isn't whining, it has evidence and information followed in the end by a thoughtful, balanced suggestion.  The effect I want this to have is to allow the mask to be useful in freeing up a spell slot, but not be unbalancing in regards to instant recastability.</P><P>And no this isn't a petition.  No flaming please. ;)</P><P>---------------</P><P>NOTE:  This is not a request to return the mask to its original state.  I would very much appreciate it if you took the time to read this entire post.</P><P>I write this to you in regards to the Coterie Mask of the Dead, and its retroactive change.  I would first like to give you some information about this quest in case you weren't completely familiar with it:</P><P>You must battle creatures ranging all the way up to level 58, with the abilities to Complete Heal and Harm Touch for a lethal amount.  Not one of these creatures, not 4 of these creatures.  Literally, hundreds of these creatures.  This is not a trivial task by any means.  It requires hours of coordination in a high level group to complete.  I took my friends and spent the hours to get the blood.</P><P>Some people were so frustrated with the difficulty (rareness) of the drops, that they resorted to paying fees upwards of 2,000 platinum for every blood.  Thats 8,000 platinum for this mask.  Some also sold their old face slot items to raise this money, thinking that this mask would be permanently worn in their face slot.</P><P>Secondly, I would like to show you the stats of this item, which MUST be worn to be able to use.  Keep in mind that the level of the people wearing this will be very high:</P><P>Coterie Mask of the Dead<BR>5 AC -5 CHA +25 mana +10 svpoison +10 svcold<BR>Effect:  Feign Death<BR>Cast Time:  1.7 seconds, with moderate chance of failure.</P><P>If you took away the effect (which this patch has effectively done), you'd find that the mask is very much a mid-30s type item in regards to stats.  Higher level characters have the potential to lose a LOT of stats by wearing this mask over whichever mask they previously wore.</P><P>Now, regarding the change you made.</P><P>The item now has 5 charges on it (1 charge left for many who already possessed this item.)  Remember, the spell this item casts is Feign Death.  Feign Death is usually cast while a monster is hitting you and you are attempting escape (monk and high level shadowknight pulling techniques aside.)  The chance of this spell interrupting is extremely high.  Additionally, even if the spell goes through, there is a considerable chance that the spell will 'fail', generating a 'Soandso has fallen to the ground.' message.  I have had this item fail 4 times in a row many, many times.  That uses up 80% of the potential of the mask right there.  This is highly unacceptable for the stats, difficulty and usage of the mask.</P><P>Secondly, this change was retroactive.  This means that everyone who spent hours upon hours of time, or very high amounts of money, basically obtained an item which would be looked on by even necromancers in their 30s with disdain.</P><P>Thirdly, this item requires Vampyre faction.  This faction is virtually useless, this is basically the only quest generated from it and there are no merchants or bankers to be found with it.  Raising this faction lowers the faction for Katta Castellum.  Many people gave up faction to this major city (with many major quests, merchants, bankers, etc.) for the chance at this item.  That is now lost, they are left with useless faction, a useless item, and less platinum on their person in many many cases.</P><P>Considering the evidence above, I find it hard to believe the original intent of the mask was to have 5 charges.  Fine, if you intended this item to originally have 5 charges (basically making this an item no one would ever even attempt getting) and you changed it now, that is up to you (although I will delve further into this shortly.)  The retroactive portion of this bothers me greatly.  My brothers and sisters of the dark arts invested great time, effort and money in order to get this item.  Now all their work has been erased.  The last retroactive nerf I can remember was the moss covered twig.  I am sure any balance issues you may have with this mask were definately not to the extent that this weapon had.  Changing all masks in game to this state was most certainly uncalled for and every single person who spent any breath of energy getting this item feels cheated, abused and generally disenfranchised.  It seems that it was  a hasty decision based on complaints that could have been dealt with in so many other ways.  I hope you can admit that the retroactive nature of this change is something that was a very ill-conceived decision on the part of you.</P><P>Ok, now I would like to muse about WHY this change needed to take place.  The mask had the following benefits before the change:</P><P>Necromancers<BR>-Allowed us to free up one of our very booked spell slots (even more so with the new Luclin spells being fixed) for a spell we would normally never unmem.<BR>-Allowed us a better way to cope when the spell fails.  Normally a necro would have to run around for a while with mobs in tow until the spell icon popped back up.  This mask allowed us convenience by being instantly recastable.<BR>-Gave us another option above what we had before for the few pulls it takes a necro to pull off, given the danger of a 60+ mob hitting you if your spell fails the first time.</P><P>Shadowknights<BR>-Gave SKs below level 60 many of the benefits above (if they were of the Dark Elf or Iksar race until the recent change.)<BR>-Level 60 SKs, having the spell death peace, which has a much lower cast time, extremely low failure rate and very fast refresh time, found this mask to be nothing but a toy.  They also already have Blood Ember Greaves (excepting Iksar SKs), which have almost the same effect.</P><P>Basically, what I see the only major balance problem with is that it is instant recast, giving necro/SKs an *extremely* slight edge over monks in regards to coping ability after failures.  I can understand why you felt the need to change it, even though it didn't unbalance anything in any practical way.</P><P>However, by nerfing all these items in the game, you also removed the other benefits it had.  Freeing up the tight spell slots is the major one.  I believe there was a much better answer than giving the item charges.  This is what it is.</P><P>Solution to Instant Recast Issue:</P><P>There are a number of good ideas floating around.  For example, increasing the cast time was one of the rather popular ones.  However, I believe if you looked at the issue at hand objectively, you'll see this:</P><P>The mask had an instant recast time because the item system does not allow for recast times on item effects.  This was deemed unbalanced.  The solution would be to add a recast time somehow.  Using conventional means, that would not be possible on an item correct?  Well, all you need to do is change the spell effect on the Coterie Mask of the Dead.  When the spell is successfully cast (not interrupted), the character feigns death with the normal chance of failure, etc.  However, one additional thing happens.  A buff is placed on the character for roughly 6 seconds.  While this buff is in place, recasting the mask will not stick.  I'm sure you remember a similar change like this, the Donal's Breastplate of Mourning.  This seems like the best solution, effectively giving the mask a recast time while still providing the benefit of a free spell slot and still lowering the stats on the face (generally) since it has to be worn.  Since the buff lasts 6 seconds, it will still be less effective than Death Peace and the monk FD skill, but still provide an item worth the effort it takes to achieve.</P><P>I would really love to see an official statement regarding this change.  It has upset a lot of people, and some even considered it the last straw on the camel's back for this game.  A one-liner in the patch message does not suffice.  The entire necromancer and shadowknight community would like to hear what made this decision go into the game, as well as your take on the solution presented above.  I would be soo pleased if this mask generated some sort of a useful item considering how much time and money went into people obtaining it.</P><P>Thank you for reading this long winded post.  I appreciate the fixing of necromancer group tap spells and their duration increase, as well as all the other various things put in the previous patch.  I haven't lost faith in you guys or this game yet, but sometimes it seems that things are rushed and hurried, and deserve a second look.  This is my request for a second look at this change that has left so many people severely upset, as well as a thoughtful suggestion on how to fix that.  I hope to see a new post addressing this whole thing soon.</P><P>Thanks very much,</P><P>Daedrea Darksoul<BR>---------------------</P><P>Edited by - Daedrea Darksoul on 01/09/2002  14:36:15</font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">I support you 100% Daedrea.  Pity that one can't sign this message to give it more weight, but I think we deserve a response from VI more than "it's now working as intended" after 2 weeks.  If an item was broken, it should be fixed IMMEDIATELY with an emergency patch or otherwise an official warning should be posted so people won't waste their time AND money trying to get the item.  It's not the mask itself, it's the principle, and people who didn't spend any time getting the mask simply can't sympathize with those who did.</P><P>You simply don't retroactively nerf an item without giving any reasons.  That shows a complete disrespect for people and their time, a complete disregard for paying customers, and a complete lack of customer communication.  </P><P>And please, anyone who is going to flame this thread, don't ASS-U-ME that everybody took exactly 30 minutes to do the quest.  I know alot of people who spent DAYS building up faction, /auctioning for bloods, and organizing groups to kill Xin Thall Centiens, disregarding the thousands of pp that went down the drain.  This is what pisses me off - far more than the nerfing of the mask itself.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  I do not want to do an involved quest one day that took me weeks and months to solve and then, *patch*, it's become worthless.  VI has done this in the past, and people have bit their lips and moved on, but that's the cowards way out.  We NEED to make them know just how WRONG this is - not only the retroactive nerf, but nerf without giving a reason, without compensation, not even an apology to those who wasted their time.</P><P>I know you anti-whine people are out there and laughing and thinking "Gee, I'm glad I didn't spend time on this quest that I *knew* would be nerfed." Don't you see how completely retarded this has become? You come to EXPECT nerfs to happen - that, to me, is a far greater problem than if you had felt that this nerf was unfair.  That shows me that the company we're giving our money to is no longer trustworthy - that they release faulty, broken products and don't even apologize when more innocent people than you or I does the quest with the full hope of keeping the item and are screwed.</P><P>That's their greatest crime - transcending far past whether necros needed(and we don't need) the mask or not.</P><P></P><P>Etadanik the Redeemed<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

Then I spent another 20hours killing in Katta to repair my faction enough to do the quest. 2days later it was nerfed.</P><P>So I spent 1kpp and wasted 40hours of my time trying to do this quest. The nerf was two days later.</P><P>I am going to petition again and again and again till we get some kind of response.</P><P>This nerf was way heavy handed and way over the top. It shouldnt have been retroactive, at the least they should have replaced the existing ones with something worth while to a 55+ character. At the best they should have left the ones in game alone and made em no drop or something.</P><P>This really isnt good enough.
