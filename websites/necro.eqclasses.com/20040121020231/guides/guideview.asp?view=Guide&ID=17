				This is meant as a list of tips and tricks (in no particular order) designed to make your life easier. Some you might know, some you might find obvious and some you might find stupid. Still I will list them  here since they helped me and there is a good chance they will help somebody else. Just keep in mind that this is my own experience. <br><br>1. Always have some kind of escape method ready. For me, it's always Death Peace (or Feigh Death). This is the first  spell I memorize after death and I never take it out. Depending on where / what I hunt, I might have something else loaded (Root, ST, Harmshield, etc). <br><br>2. Even if you have Run3 it's a good idea to invest in some SoW potions. Dont use them all the time, but have them on you.<br><br>3. If you have the possibility, invest in a Circlet of Shadow. You want the one with 0.1 casting time of Gather Shadows. Once you have it you will wonder how did you live without it. <br><br>4. If you are above level 57, allways carry a Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffin on you. If possible, have also an Essence Emerald on you at all times.<br><br>5. Do those "Your spell was interrupted" messages annoy you when you try to cast after you just stopped ? To avoid this just tap your left/right arrow once after you stopped so you will turn just a tad. Then cast and you will never get interrupted. <br><br>6. Learn to manage your mana, be efficient. The fact that we are one of the best at regaining mana does not mean you have to be inneficient. Dont tap unless you know you will get the full benefit of the tap (i.e. dont use Mujaki if you miss less then 850 HPs). Learn how much you get healed for from your current lifetap over time when using your current Lich. Say I use Vex and Demi Lich. Then I will get healed for roughly 1000 HPs from Vex while Demi Liching. Dont cast it when you miss only 500 HPs, you will waste mana. Apply this to your current spells.<br><br>7. Get rid of the habbit of using KEI as soon as possible. Starting with level 49 when you get Lich, you should forget KEI. You WILL have to use your Lich line at higher levels so better get used to it, learn to monitor your mana and health. <br><br>8. Invest in some Stalking Probes. These are non-stackable tinkered items (low trivial) that have 5 charges of Eye of Zomm. They go for around 30pp and you can sell them back to vendors for about 15pp once they are empty. The Eye of Zomm was designed for scouting but it lasts too little to do any good (only 30 seconds). Instead, use it to tap it to regain health, to reduce downtime. They are quite handy when you dont have a mob around to tap. Of course, the uber equivalent is the Holgresh Elder Beads which have unlimited charges of Eye of Zomm. But they no longer drop in game and are insanely expensive.<br><br>9. Use hotkeys for your spell gems. There is nothing more annoying than trying to click with your mouse on that FD icon in a laggy zone. ALT-<spell_slot_number> works to some extent. I have mapped all the 8 spell slots to keys on the left side of the keyboard. Thus, FD is only a keystroke away. Same with your Tap, Nuke and so on because you, as me, are most likely used to have certain spells in certain slots. <br><br>10. Use the 3rd person view cameras. They are big help. As a caster you will find this invaluable, wheather you are soloing, grouping or raiding. Learn to use ALT-<left/right arrows) to rotate the view, or ALT-<delete/insert> to zoon out. You will get used to it and will realize how usefull that is. I spend 98% of my fighting time in 3rd person view because I can easily see adds, appreciate distances, see the surroundings and much more. Also, if you are involved in raid leading you will find 3rd person view invaluable in having an overview of the whole fighting area.<br><br>11. On the "efficient" theme again: when you are raiding do not hesitate to bug your friendly mage and get a bracer (for increased damage of nukes/taps) and a ring (for decreased casting times. Note: if you already have an item with spell haste, the mage ring will not stack with it). Also, bug your friendly cleric for Blessing of Faith/Reverence which is 10% spell haste that STACKS with whatever focus you already have. Get the most of your spells. <br><br>12. Learn to control your aggro while grouping or raiding. Feign Death / Death Peace are you friends. After you cast your dots just FD once to loose some aggro. If you dont, there is a high chance that a) you will be summoned and you will waste more mana to tap your life back  (if you dont die) or b) mob will run to you which everyone hates. Ping Pong'ing a mob in raids is a Bad Thing. <br><br>13. Dont go AFK with Lich on ;-)<br><br>14. Learn everything about your class. Learn about your spells, learn different methods of fighting: fear kite, root dot, pet tank, lifetep/tank, aggro kite, charm killing. Try them all, have fun, decide which one you like best<br><br>15. Learn about the other classes. Dont fall into the same category with the ignorant that says "Oh, didnt know necros could do that!". Learn about their spells, their abilities. Learn which of their spell you need (you need regen for example but you dont need AGI and so on)<br><br>16. Sending a pet at that Death Touching mob will not save your butt. You WILL get Death Touched.<br><br>17. Harmshield or Quivering Veil of Xarn will NOT protect you against a Death Touch.<br><br>18. Harmshield or Quivering Veil of Xarn will protect you from melee, spell damage or falling damage but not from stuns.<br><br><br>Well, that's it for now. Have fun ;)<br>&nbsp;<br>
