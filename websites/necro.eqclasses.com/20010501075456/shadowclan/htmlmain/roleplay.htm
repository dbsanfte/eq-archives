for stealing one of "her" kills. This is just not right. Just because the

like the taste of your blood doesn't mean that you need to hog all the

action. See 1.2 about the "what goes around comes around" principle.&nbsp;</font></li>

    <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC"><b><font size="2">Multi-Group raids:</font></b><font size="2">&nbsp;
      On any raid which requires more than one group of 6, and which the Shadowclan
      dictates the loot policies, the following rules apply:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Need Over Greed:</b><br>
      <br>
      When an item drops, all those who are present that can use and<b> <u>would</u></b><u>
      </u></font><u><b><font size="2"> use</font></b></u><font size="2"> the item will
      /random for it, being careful <b> NOT to /random</b> until the raid leader has said so,
      with the victor getting the spoils. Once a person has won an item on that particular raid, they are
      <b> excluded</b> from future /randoms on that raid until everyone of that class has attained an item. The
      <b> raid leader will call out the numbers to be used in the random.</b><br>
      <br>
      Example:<br>
      Lifebane is frolicking through the plane of fear with Shadowclan and some invited friends when the Uber Robe-o-death drops. Usable by Necromancers only,
      Lifebane looks around and sees that there are 2 other necros, Kimmurl and PhatLewtBob (an invited friend of the clan). Bruthah the mighty finishes looting
      his own corpse for the 15th time that hour, and calls for all necros who would
      use the Uber Robe-o-death to /random. He then supplies the numbers to /random
      between (he calls out because he is the raid leader) this time Bruthah, in his
      infinite wisdom, chooses 20 and 1020. Lifebane types /ran 20 1020 and comes up
      with a 983 (we still think he rigged it). Kimmurl is busy flogging Verrin and
      /randoms a half-hearted 265, and PhatLewtBob comes up with 762. Hoowah! The
      elder has finally won something! Lifebane moves over to the corpse and picks up
      his prize, and with a glazed look heads off into a dark corner….        Twenty Minutes later, The group leader that had slain the latest beastie loots
      it  (only group leaders loot corpses on raids of this nature) and calls out that
      "Hoowah! Dos Critter has the Bracer-of-helpImlostinthewoods!" This item is
      usable by wizards, enchanters, and necromancers. Bruthah the mighty, while
      looting his corpse again, calls out for the people of those classes to /random
      for it and chooses, in his infinite wisdom, the numbers 300 to 1300. Braiel,
      altho falling into the enchanter class, decides that she has no use for the
      bracer-of-helpimlostinthewoods and says that she will not participate in the
      /random for it. With high hopes, Drezzden, Kimmurl, and PhatLewtBob all roll for
      this with Kimmurl coming out the victor. Note that Lifebane did not /random for
      this item. He got his loot for this trip…&nbsp; Several hours later, Bruthah is looting his corpse again when an exclamation
      goes up of "Hoowah! A necro only whack-bonk of power!". PhatLewtBob wins this by
      default as both Kimmurl and Lifebane had already won their items. If another
      item dropped that was necromancer only, the process would begin again with all 3
      necromancers /randoming for it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Recap:</font></font></li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC">Loot is determined by a /random roll, with the highest roll winning the
        prize.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC">Only group leaders are to look into corpses or
        for the loot.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC">Everyone that is on the raid is entitled to a fair chance for loot, both Clan
        members and invites. Latecomers may not be eligible or suffer a penalty, as
        determined by the raid leader. On the other hand, those that participate on the
        "break" of a particular raid may be entitled to additional benefits, as determined by the raid leader and stated BEFORE the raid.  (this can
        be +200 to rolls, etc)</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC">If an item drops that your class can use but you do not want, you are not
        required to random for it.  You can also roll and if you win it, offer it to
        another on the raid that can use it.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC">You are only eligible to /random for an item if:<b><br>
        a)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; You have not already won something on that trip or&nbsp;<br>
        <b> b)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; All those that could use the item had already won
        something on that trip.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC">There may be special situations where an item will be given to a particular
        person without a /random. Example: an epic quest item drops and it's the last
        piece that a particular person needs for the quest, this must be stated by the
        raid leader PRIOR to the beginning of that particular raid.&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC">When in doubt, the raid leader has final
        say, backed by the attending guild officers.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a question, refer
        back to this rule.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC">Notes and
    Exceptions:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC" size="2"><b>God Items:</b>&nbsp; All non-epic God items will be straight
        randomed to all that can use it regardless if they had already won an
        item. (God's only spawn once a week, and their items are not counted as plane gear.)</font></li>
      <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC" size="2"><b>Epic Quest Items:&nbsp;</b>
        These quest items will go to the highest leveled race/class that needs
        it the most.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC" size="2"><b>Non-Rare Gems/items:</b>&nbsp;
        Non-rare gems and items (such as emerald rings, pages, etc.) are looted by
        group leaders. Group leader then give these gems/items to the group cleric to
        cover the expenses of their reagents required to buff the tanks.&nbsp;
        Pages and Words are handed out to the appropriate caster class.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC" size="2"><b>Rare Gems:</b>&nbsp; Diamond, jancinth and black sapphires are zone
        randomed by the group leaders and then group leaders random within there party.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC" size="2"><b>Breastplates and Robes:&nbsp;
        </b>Do <b>NOT</b> count towards the "1 Item Only" rule.&nbsp; They are the exception.&nbsp;<br>
        <u>Example:</u>&nbsp; If &quot;Necrobob&quot; wins a Bracer and then a BP drops later,
        &quot;Necrobob&quot; can <b>also</b> /random for the BP.&nbsp; If
        &quot;Necrojohn&quot; wins a BP first however, &quot;Necrojohn&quot; can
        <b>not</b> roll for the Bracer if it drops afterwards. The Breastplate/Robe counts as the 1 Drop
        <b> IF</b> it is won <b>first</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is possible that one
        Raid Member can win 2 pieces before anyone else wins one IF the BP/Robe was the
        second item won.&nbsp; But, from prior experience... this is a one in
        thousand scenario.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC" size="2"><b>The Final Piece of a Set:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        If an item drops that would complete a persons full set of his class's armor, then that person gets that drop by default. The exception to this
        rule is a Breastplate or Robe. Those are /randomed as usual.&nbsp;
        Though this may sound unfair at first, remember that the person who
        needs only one item will not touch the other items of that class that
        may drop.&nbsp; So others of same class have better chance to obtain
        those pieces.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC" size="2"><b>Plane of Fear:&nbsp;</b>
        Cryosilk pieces will be randomed to Enchanters and Mages first.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Tahoma" color="#CCCCCC" size="2"><b>Plane of Hate:</b>&nbsp;
        Cryosilk pieces from chests will be randomed to Necros and  Wizards.</font><br>
