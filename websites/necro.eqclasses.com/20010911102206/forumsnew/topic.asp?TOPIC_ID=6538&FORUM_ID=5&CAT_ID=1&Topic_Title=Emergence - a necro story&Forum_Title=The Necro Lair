        <hr noshade size="1">
        
        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Once, before the expeditions to Kunark and the rediscovery of the wastelands of Velious, when necromancers walked the lands of Norrath as undisputed lords, before they were struck down by the mighty magic known only as "knerff", there lived a knight.  Kith Bravewind was strong and true to his lord, Mithaniel Marr and hailed from the walled city of Freeport, though he was declared a criminal for his participation in destroying the fallen knight, Sir Lucan D'Lere and traveled the land bringing justice and honor to his name and to his brotherhood.  </P><P>     The young knight fell in love with an elven cleric hailing from Felwithe deep in the forests of Faydark.  Together they journied to cleanse the fallen Estate of Unrest, Befallen, fallen Najena and many more places.  Peace and happiness seemed to follow them, but it was not unnoticed. <BR> <BR>     The young couple was ambushed by undead minions while traveling through the forest of Kithikor from the city of Qeynos.  Though they fought bravely with spell and sword, the young lass was injured.  The knight stood over her unconsious body, felling fiends left and right with his sword, Ghoulbane, but to no avail.  The fiends overwhelmed him, forcing him back, and when he recovered his ground, the cleric was gone.</P><P>     Enraged beyond reason, he destroyed the remainder of the ghoulish host, but found not a clue to what became of his love.  Then, as dawn's light began to emerge, mighty Kith fell to his knees and prayed to his god, to show him a sign as to where the elven lass might be found.  Mithaniel Marr answered the young knight's prayer and told him that she could be found deep within the ancient city of Guk, but dark forces were gathering against him and that he must use caution.  The young knight gathered a small band together and set forth to liberate his love.  <BR>     As they entered Guk, not a soul was to be seen, however there were signs of battle.  Pieces of ghouls, mummies, and spectres were mixed with the bodies of the noble frogloks, who died defending their halls.  Venturing deeper, the party found a tunnel out of which the stench of the damned poured forth in torrents.  Weapons and spells at the ready, they cautiosly entered the halls of the dead, but found only a few sentries that caused almost no struggle.  Making their way to a small causeway, they entered the water and swam for what seemed like an eternity.  They emerged in a ruined bedroom only to find that they were indeed expected.  Undead warriors pierced their flesh with tainted weapons, vampire bats sampled their blood, enchanted skeletons froze their flesh with a soul-chilling bitter cold only to be rewarmed by the fires and lightings of undead wizards searing their flesh.  Spells flew, swords sang, and axes hewed deeply into undead flesh as they fought to a stone bridge.  <BR>     Fighting their way deeper into the city, passed an ambush set by an assasin, they reached the bottom only to find themselves face to face with an new pack of undead headed by a fallen cavalier, a twisted sage, and the master of the dungeons, the executioner.  Half of Kith's group fell in that onslaught and Kith himself was wounded sore.  Kith, a wizard, and a druid were all that remained alive.  They dragged their fallen comrades to what seemed to be a safe place, as the druid began to treat their injuries, she noticed that Kith's face had paled and began to have a greenish tint to it, and there seemed to be pustules forming, but dismised it as fatigue and tricks of the light.  <BR>     They had barely caught their breath when they heard the screams.  The gathered their weapons and ran toward the sound, and straight into an ambush.  The druid was incinerated by an furious barrage of spells from an undead archmagus, the wizard was grabbed by a large disembodied hand and thrown into a stone wall, falling to the ground apparantly dead.  Kith found himself besieged by some kind of undead berserker, a fiend that had worked itself into a horrifying frenzy to which he quickly succumbed.<BR>     Kith awoke to find himself, armour and weapons stripped from him, in chains before some horrible ghoul noble.  As Kith scanned the room for any sort of weapon, he saw his elven love sobbing, huddled in a corner.  Calling upon powerful magic, Kith broke his bonds and smote the fiends with his magic.  Grabbing the elven cleric, he pushed her out of the room and quickly followed.  They soon reached the safe hall and found that the wizard was still alive.  The magus began to cast the spell that would whisk them away when the ghoul force rounded the corner.  Kith rushed forward to buy time, and faced off against the ghoul lord.  The ghoul lord muttering an ancient and horrible spell as Kith leapt forward, stunned the knight long enough to complete his incantation.  He fell screaming and was still.  Oblivious to this, the wizard completed his spell and as they started to fade away, they saw the knight's skin rupture and a small, wrinkled body began to emerge.  <BR>     The new being rose and stepped out of the gorey remants of Kith Bravewind.  Looking at the assembled host, he commanded their obescience.  All bowed, with the sole exception of the archmagus.  Turning towards the undead magus, the new figure gestured.  The magus found his blood boiling, while simultaneously shivering from some insideous poison.  The magus dropped to it's knees, but it was too late.  With a final gesture, every single bone within the undead frame burst into white hot flames.  The short figure smirked, once, briefly, bent down and withdrew a metallic robe from the ashes of what was once the ghoul archmagus.  Donning it, Kaeric Gath strode out of the city of Guk and into the world to spread disease and decay and to further understand the power of death. </P><P><BR>Kaeric Gath<BR>45th Necromancer of Bertoxxulous<BR>E'Ci</font></td>
