The fact that they hid the cost of the tax does not mean you are not inheriting the burden.<br /><br />IRAQ<br /><br />I initially supported the action against Saddam in Iraq. I did so since I believed my government when it stated he had WMDs. Time has not support my initial belief unfortunately. No evidence has come forward that provided any credible support to an active weapons program. A previous poster mentions the centrifuges in the rose garden ... they did not work. The 'Mobile Weapons Labs' that our own CIA stated could not be used, in and of themselves, to produce chemical weapons.<br /><br />I have come to believe we were mistaken to invade Iraq due to these points<br /><br />1. No active weapon program<br />2. No evidence of a viable or emmient threat to the US by Iraq<br />3. No involvment by Iraq in 9/11 <br />4. A fracturing of our strength by our occupation of Iraq while an enemy (Al Queda) is still viable<br /><br />We have approx 140,000 troops stationed in Iraq. 87 Billion will be spent this year with a 2 or 3 year window of occupation. Thats potentially 250 Billion in occupation expenses. The vaunted Iraqi oil will, even if restored to pre war levels, account for a 1/10 of that amount. <br /><br />We must succeed in our restoration of Iraq. Failure will set back the developmenmt of the Mid East for years. It will demonstrate the limit of America's power and embolden our enemies. We must succeed because the Iraqi people deserve it.

How do we come back together to rebuild Iraq?<br /><br />Well thats about all I will add to this little topic but two last points. Regardless of your belief on the subject of Iraq please take your right to vote seriously and exercise it. (I am sure you guys do but it always been a pet peeve when I meet someone that does not vote.)<br /><br />And second can we please stop quoting the quoted quote of a previous quote!!!

The idea that taxing is the answer to funding every f'n program to study every f'n endangered bird (as an example). The school system is representitive of a good idea in concept where taxes be spent, but in reality I think one would find its a cesspit for the "outside the classroom" burocrats to waste my money. Especially when I'm now getting a watered down, vanilla, "don't offend the minority by talking about history" public education system.. my kids will last to 6th grade in it.. after that, public school is out the window for me.<br /><br /><br /> <blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br />I initially supported the action against Saddam in Iraq.

Iraq "could" still have recreated the WMD programs (you do agree they did actually have them at some point right?) and if they did recreate them, they could have sold them to any number of Islamofascist organizations. We then could in effect be hit in another 5 years and THEN go back and do what we did this time preemptively. That would lead us back to a question from the left, why didn't GWB take out sadam when he had the political and moral high ground, like his father before him, he didn't seize the oppertunity when he had it. I don't think he wanted to answer those questions, especially as it would be a ligitimate moral SCHMACK in the face from the immoral left (/joke)<br /><br /><br /> <blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">I have come to believe we were mistaken to invade Iraq due to these points<br /><br />1.

This search was conducted several hundred investigators and was conducted on more than one hundred sites. These sites were listed by our intelligence services as the most probable to conduct WMD product, manafacture capacity, and research. Nothing was found.<br /><br />We have conducted interviews with the scientists and engineers that were, supposedly, working in the Iraqi weapons program. All, to my knowledge, have denied the existance, in recent years, of a weapons program. (I do concede that a weapons program was in place and operating thru the mid 90s at least.)<br /><br />Further there seems disturbing signals coming from our own government. It upsets me to hear my president say we have found weapons of mass destruction as our president did regard the mobile chemical trucks, but then to read the CIA assessment of them they could not be used to make chemical weapons. <br /><br />The second point I take exception with is your statement regarding "false enlightenment". I was concerned prior to the war that Saddam had an 'active' weapons program that could yield a nuclear device 'with in a year'. I drew this from direct quotes from Wolfowitz(sp?), Cheney, and Rice. All of who stated Saddam had an active WMD program and could deploy a nuclear bomb with a year. We were in no other term spectacularly wrong on this point. <br /><br />My concerns prior to the war were unfounded based on discovered facts after our occupation of Iraq. This is not "false" enlightenment but simply enlightenment. Now we come to learn according Wolfowitz that WMDs were settled on as the best reason to 'sell' a war on Iraq. Our state of enlightenment has increased with each day we spend in Iraq. <br /><br />Lastly you argue that IF our action in Iraq stops an other attack then it is justified. Well we certainly agree on that point! However I do not believe that anyone can reasonably argue how our actions in Iraq could prevent a future attack. In fact, quite the opposite, they guarantee an attack. Not anything as horrific as 9/11 mind you but we are now in a shooting war. A war that has not subsided since May. A war that has killed over 200 Americans and wounded over 1000. If these numbers continue more than 1000 Americans will die in Iraq over the term of the occupation and many thousands will be wounded. The cost to our Nation could reach a quarter trillion and we have no assurances of our success. <br /><br />The loss of life and resources by our occupation of Iraq could easily exceed that lost on 9/11. Such a loss would be justified if it would prevent an attack upon us, such a loss would be justified if Iraq present a viable threat but neither of these are remotely probable. <br /><br /></span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

This search was conducted several hundred investigators and was conducted on more than one hundred sites. These sites were listed by our intelligence services as the most probable to conduct WMD product, manafacture capacity, and research. Nothing was found.<br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br /><br />I think about my State, I live in California, in a pretty damn small area of California at that. there are about 200 people looking for WMD. To assume they are going to find WMD by looking through buildings or Millitary storage facillities would be VERY hard considering its size. It's been stated before, this has been done by the UN inspectors, it didn't lead to much and It probally won't. There are probably (in my view anyway) a select few people in Iraq that are still breathing that know what happened to any stockpiles of WMD that existed. Listening to the Appropriations committee on TV, I heard that that organization is using Intel (through interviews) to help them with information on what REALLY happened to the WMD. I think the real facts will come out on the subject eventually. If they were destroyed 5 years ago.. It will come out, and the CIA will be held accountable if they were wrong. Hell the UN will be as well, it was the view of the whole country as well as the whole world that they had them and I believe they did. What happened to them? that is a grand question.. here's a link to an intersting article on the subject..<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.federalist.com/current/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.federalist.com/current/" target="_blank">http://www.federalist.com/current/</a></a><br /><br />I don't think the whitehouse had its own secret group of people working to come up with evidence of WMD to use as justification, The CIA used evidence it collected on its own as well as by way of information sharing with other governments. The whitehouse along with the Defense Department and the State department all bought into the facts as they saw them from the CIA<br /><br />in 1998 we passed a bill unanimously under  Clinton that called for 100million a year to supply the opposition with the tools to resist and overturn the regiem of Sadam. That was the foundation for what happened in Iraq, This along with the UN resolution to provide "serious concequences" for failure to provide an honest account of them proved to be more than enough legitimacy to the events of the last year along with the aftermath of 9/11 as a means to reflect on the implcations of non-action. <br /><br />Remember Terrorists aren't bound to any nation, but they are supported by Nations, alot of them. This is untested waters and we as Americans are the biggest target to these nation funded international terrorists. Our government; by NOT acting indirectly provided the necissary means for allow 9/11 to happen. We knew about state sponsered terrorism, the US talked about it, but nobody was willing to act on it (How COULD they act). Letting that happen again by not taking action puts us in a much worse situation as time is of the essence when your working to get public support on issues having to do with war.<br /><br />I'm happy they did it, I think in the long run its a gamble that will be worth the effort. As long as the CNNs and ABCs of the world don't obscure the TRUTH about what is taking place today in Iraq. There are MANY positive things happening in Iraq along with the problems there. I think its a disservice to our cause for the government not to present the "plan" in a way that your average American can consume.<br /><br />What it means to be working tward Democratic, Capitalist, and Humanitarian goals. How that contrasts with what they had and how they really feel about the struggle the Iraqis are living through today. A poll recently taken of the Iraqi people shows a 70ish % of the population is for the removal of Sadam, 60someodd % say it things are harder than they were  before (rightly so) and the majority of those think in the long term this is the future they want. As an american I am VERY proud of that as opposed to how proud i'd be if I was french right about now.<br /><br /><br /><br /></span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

This is an interesting discussion.<br /><br />Certainly not something I expected to find nestled deep in the rants forum, though I can see why it is with all of the childish name calling and whining that has taken place in some of the posts.<br /><br />We basically have two sides here. They are:<br />1) The side of the people who think what the USA did in Iraq was for "good" reason.<br />2) The side of the people who think what the USA did in Iraq was for "bad" reasons.<br /><br />Each of these sides are convinced that they are right and the other is wrong.<br />They demonstrate this by degrading the other side when something is said that they disagree with, whether it is in the form of offerring facts to prove them wrong or simple name calling as a few have done.<br /><br />Now, instead of taking either of those sides myself, why don't I try to offer a different perspective to all of you who are fighting over this matter?<br /><br />Quote Banez Wright:<br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">As a few people have pointed out, if this was the only factor for us going into Iraq, then we should have done the same to a LOT of other countries in the world.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br />Know what? It isn't the only factor.<br />There are many many factors. <br />Too many.<br />More than you will ever know, more than I will ever know, more than ANYONE will ever know.<br />What's the problem here? <br />The problem is that any conclusion you make based on the few simple facts that YOU have is entirely pointless, because without<br />seeing the full picture - the entire equation -you will never really know if things that were done were done for the right reasons.<br /><br />Quote Drexyll:<br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">Do you take everything at face value and buy the insinuation without thinking about it? <hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br />Thinking about it?

True or False?<br /><br />True, you say? Why? Because controlling Iraq's oil supply <b>COULD</b> be a huge benefit to American energy resources in the near future?<br />False, you say? Why? Because Saddam <b>COULD</b> pose a threat to the United States and could still have weapons of mass destruction?<br /><br />Don't you see?<br />It all comes back to opinions, not facts.<br /><br />This whole discussion here is simply a matter of what we all choose to believe about our governments and from the information which we are given.<br />Meaning, all that is said here is just everyone's personal opinions.<br />Nothing to fight over, nothing to argue over.. just state what you think, and while you are reading others posts who have conflicting opinions, just tell yourself that they could be just as right or wrong as you are.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>
