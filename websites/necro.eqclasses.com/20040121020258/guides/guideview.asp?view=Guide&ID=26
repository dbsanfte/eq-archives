				   Jakom Herelon is a level 35 warrior in the Freeport Arena.  He is probably the safest person to hunt from level 35 through 48.  <br><br>   There are a few tricks that you'll have to learn on your own that are pretty obvious when you step into that arena.  I'll just lay down the basics.<br><br>   Have your spell line up as the following:<br>Lifetap (highest you have)<br>Root<br>Snare (whichever you prefer)<br>DoT<br>DoT<br>DoT (at 35-38 switch this with your next best DoT while fighting)<br>Harmshield<br>Feign Death<br><br>Now, this spawn is the trickiest at level 35 through 38.  For inexperienced players I would suggest not attempting Jakom until at LEAST 38.  When you walk into the arena you can see are a few levels to the place.  This will be written in the perspective that you just walked up the stairs.  If you are just coming to this spawn have invis up.  The top right side is where you should set up.  If Jakom is there, wait until he is around and on the top left side.  He walks around and stops at 4 points.  The points are as follows:<br>Far left of the stairs<br>Far right of the stairs<br>Far left and forward (spawn point)<br>Far right and forward (your basecamp)<br><br>Wait until he is at his spawn point and root him.  If root doesn't stick try again.  If there is the occasional worst case scenario jump down a floor.  Keep trying to root until it sticks (I really only had a problem with this when I was lower levels).  Once root sticks land a snare on him.  Now unload all of your DoTs on him.  If all of your DoTs wear off (level 35-38) reapply.  This will kill him.  This is basically a root dotting technique.  <br><br>Now once you have finished you should be able to go to your basecamp and have enough time to med to full.  He runs on a 6 minutes spawn timer.  The second he spawns repeat the process above.  DO NOT FEAR. I extremely emphasize this DO NOT FEAR.  If you fear and your snare breaks, he will run straight to the Pure Casters guild and pull a building of 30-65 casters on your butt.<br><br>Now for the trickier parts.<br><br>Orientation is still as if you just walked up the stairs to the arena.<br>If you are feeling lucky, walk backwards, turn left(not moving, just turning) and run around the corner ahead of you around the arena.  Voila! The warriors guild.  Within there is a roamer that walks around the surrounding hallway of the warrior guild.  Just wait for him.  Once he hits you run around to entrance of the arena (MAKE SURE JAKOM IS DEAD BEFORE DOING THIS).  Now, his pathing will take him twice the distance you can run.  If you're in a safe mood run to base camp and go through your root dotting with this guy.  <br><br>If Jakom spawns after killing the roamer and you have too little: mana jump down a floor and run around the outside of the arena so he does see you mainting the same distance always.<br>If Jakom spawns WHILE you're killing the roamer, FD, Harmshield, or do whatever is necessary to keep yourself alive =).<br><br>****IMPORTANT NOTE****<br>If root breaks and Jakom starts walking towards your basecamp, jump off before he gets within 10 feet of you.  If you wait too long he can jump right over the ledge with you.  Otherwise his pathing will take him back around and to the stairs to come get you (this has happened to me MANY a time).  Also, it might seem like the level 60 guild leaders on the ledge of the building next to arena would aggro you, but they won't.<br>****END OF IMPORTANT NOTE****<br><br>***For Advanced players only***<br>If you are feeling REALLLLLY lucky you can try the double spawn of warriors.  Go down from arena to gate within arena.  Follow this hall.  Keep invis up just in case.  A little ways down the hall there are two warriors.  Use a traditional Tag method of pulling (snare one, feign, voila(for a more detailed method of doing this refer to another guide)).  You can usually pull these people out to the area in front of arena and kill them (pathing is premium here).  All the warriors drop Words, (and/or) Fine Steel Weps, (and,or) Chain Mail (Tunic is rarest but it does drop).  Sometimes a few plat drops too.  The safest way to level in these parts is Jakom alone.  If you want more exp and a challenge, try all four.  If you have a mage partner or a necro partner, you can easily take down the two warriors down the back entrance hall together.<br><br>***Last important note***<br>Be VERY careful with roamer within warrior guild.  For some reason, the Guildmaster sometimes is at the door (who quads for 300).  Its nice to have SoW or invis up before walking through those halls.<br><br>All the warriors hit tops for 96 (and bash and kick).  I found it easiest to not use a pet because Jakom kills it so fast.  By the time you have a pet that can solo him without Augment Death, he will be too low for tangible exp.<br><br>You might find this spawn kind of hard at 35-38.  Resists will be high and damage upon you will be all the same.  At 39, a new range of DoTs can be used against him.  At 44, Asystole and Chilling Embrace can almost kill him alone.<br>If you have any questions just drop me a tell in game.<br><br>Good Luck and Happy Adventuring!<br>Elwiseph C'Vex<br>Level 50 Necromancer<br>Quellious<br><br>&nbsp;<br>
