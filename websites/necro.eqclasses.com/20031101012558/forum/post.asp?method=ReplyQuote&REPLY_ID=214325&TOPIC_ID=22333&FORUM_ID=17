Thinking that it was just a wax buildup I started doing what they always say NOT to do and tried to "dig out" the wax with q-tips, to no avail.  As time passed my ear started to really HURT, n I knew I had an infection. <br /> <br />Now, I don't have any health insurance (hell I dont know anyone that does anymore), so I try to avoid going to the doctor/hospital unless it's an absolute emergency.  As days passed I tried just pouring alcohol and peroxide in my ear and hoped things would get better.  It didnt.  By last Monday the pain in my ear was so unbearable I couldn't sleep or focus on anything else, so finally I decided to go be seen.  I had wanted to go to our local "walk-in" clinic as it would have been MUCH cheaper than an ER visit, but alas they were closed for the night, so on to the ER I went. <br /> <br />I was seen by the doctor, told I did indeed have a bad infection, and given a prescription for 500mg Amoxicillin (oral) and a whopping 6 Darvocets for pain.  The Darvocets lasted about 24 hours, but my mother (who is a nurse herself) assured me that the pain should subside within 36 hours or so as the antibiotics kicked in. <br /> <br />3 days later the infection has gotten worse, not better.  IT's now spread to my jaw and the glands in my throat.  The pain is horrendous.  Being that the antibiotics should have had some effect by now and have not, my mom suggested I high-tail it back in to the docs and let them know whats up; apparently I need a stronger antibiotic and God knows I need something for the pain - 6 Advils at a time ain't cutting it. <br /> <br />Since it's mid-day I decide to save a few hundred bucks and go to that walk-in clinic.  Now, I haven't had a state-issued picture ID since I lost my last one several years ago.  I do, however, still have my social security card and my birth certificate for such ocassions.  So I get to the clinic with my papers from the ER the other night and my swollen face, and start to fill out their paperwork.  The lady at the desk then asks for a picture ID.  I explain that I just lost my license last week (ok I lied, but hey) but that I do have my SS card, birth certificate, and credit card, and that furthermore I'll be paying cash, anyway.  The woman tells me "sorry, it's our policy to require a picture ID before treatment." <br /> <br />"You can't take my social and birth certificate?  I'm seriously in need of some help here!" <br /> <br />"sorry" she says.  At this point I"m stunned and pretty pissed off, so I raise my voice loud enough that everyone there in the lobby can hear it and say "you're telling me that you're going to refuse me medical care because I lost my driver's license?"  All she can say is "Im sorry sir, it's our policy..." <br /> <br />WTF happened to the Hippocratic oath?  I didnt know "my papers must be in order" before I could see a Doctor.  I've never heard of such a thing before, nor has my mother, an ER nurse with almost 30 yrs of experience under her belt.<br /><br />God bless the police state.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span></font></td>

He would only be making a legal move, not a life/death decision. Basically exploring the impacts balancing that is all. I have thought about it and don't find that it is even remotely a good idea, but the context of the discussion is in situations where a man and woman aren't married. In the situation where they were your point about not being able to afford it "kil it kill it" is about right on with what does take place I'd bet.</span></font></td>

She has the right to make a financial choice here, she choose that she has the right to terminate the babys life because of the financial impacts on the babies future as well as her own (a legitimate concern for sure) while a man has absolutely no impact on this decision from a legal perspective. The woman can make a judgement based on the fathers financial stability (reguardless of her own). What if.... the man had the right to absolve himself of financial responsibility as well. just a legal document that said he could choose prior to some deadline (say 6 months into the pregnancy) that he wasn't financially ready to assume the responsibility of fatherhood. <br /><br />Take a minute to imagine the impacts of that. What would the impacts of the amount of abortions be in the country if the man could make that judgement as well? I mean really, she has the right to make that financial judgement, the man has no such right, but he has ALL the responsibilities of that child once its born. .. there are ALOT of implications of this for sure,, but it's something that is very interesting to think about.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I just wanted to add, what would the "fathers right to see and raise his child be in this case, how would the child understand the choice his father made? how would that impact the family unit in america? Should the government have any right to force a father who choose to absolve his rights to responsibility of that child to stay away from the child? restrain his right to fatherhood if the mother decided to have the child reguardless of the fathers choice?</span></font></td>

I could have chosen better wording but I was in a hurry and I assumed that my point would be simple to understand, obviously not.  Let me explain further.  "Rights" dont exist.  They are a concept, an IDEA.  Ideas mean jackshit if they are ot enforced and believed by the mass, at least as far as "civil liberties" are concerned.  Without a governing body in place to hold those accountable that we deem to have defied our concept of due rights, as Rob so efficiently pointed out, people can do whatever they want.  We might think its wrong but that doesn't do you much good when someone comes in your house and shoots you.  It was once socially acceptable to cut off a person's hand if they stole.  Even today in some countries women's clittoris (sp?) are removed for various reasons.  These "rights" you point out exist as a fact because there is someone to step in if they are broken.  That's it. Rights only given by the powerful?  Even then the government is only truly powerful because we give it the right to govern.    ANd as I pointed out, if that body wasn't there, they would surely not still be observed.<br /><br />As far as your off topic remark about the Peterson case, the answer is no.  I do NOT believe that only women have the right to determine the unborn child's fate, and I DO support the double homicide charges.  Any other questions?<br /><br />Edit:  Rephrase.

It has been argued by Drex and an other poster that this amendment was not properly ratified but they provide no real support for this position. <br /><br />Primarly the challenge to the validity of the 16th lay in improper conduct by the states durings its ratification process. For example, some states used the term "incomes" instead of "income" or "levied" instead of "lay". The plaintiff also pointed out discrenpancies with capitolization and puncucation between some states version and the actual amendment.<br /><br />I would like to quote the actual judge in his ruling.<br /><br />"The sixteenth amendment and the tax laws passed pursuant to it<br />have been followed by the courts for over half a century.  They represent<br />the recognized law of the land.<br />     Because the sixteenth amendment was duly certified by the<br />Secretary of State, because defendants have not alleged that the minor<br />variations in capitalization, punctuation and wording of the various state<br />resolutions are materially different in purpose or effect from the<br />language of the congressional joint resolution proposing adoption of the<br />sixteenth amendment, and because the sixteenth amendment has been<br />recognized and acted upon since 1913, the Court rejects defendants'<br />argument that the sixteenth amendment is not a part of the United States<br />Constitution.<br />     Plaintiff's motion to dismiss is DENIED.<br />"<br /><br />Drex while I respect your right to choose any lifestyle you want you have a fundemental responsibility as a citizen  to contribute to the general welfare of our society.

We had a DOCTOR tell us that years ago in elementary school.  Same thing with peroxide, I frequently get wax buildups in my ear and it was a DOCTOR that told me peroxide is good to "bubble it out."

But you do bring up a good point: UL testing ISNT free; who pays for it?  Manufacturers pay UL to test their products so that they can stick that little "UL approved" logo on their products if they pass.  They do this because they know that many consumers look for that label, and will buy a product that carries it over one that does not; they'll also generally pay extra for a product that's UL approved.  <i>It's a smart business decision for the manufacturers to pay UL to test their products.</i> Given the number of years UL has been around, I'd say plenty of manufacturers realize this.<br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />It is once again you who is being silly.  Do you think for one moment that the cost that manufacturer incur getting products tested and approved isn't passed on to you? If you don't, then perhaps it is a bit more clear why you ran your perfectly good business into the ground.<br /><br />Not only that, but I can guarantee you that at least 25% of the population of the US (probably upwards of 50%, maybe even more) don't have a fricking clue what the Underwriters Laboratory is, or what it does.

Should my insurance company inform me that they'll not cover any damages I suffer after eating said dogshit, which they have NOT approved, and should I chosoe to eat the dogshit anyway, I don't expect you to do more than my insurance company and pay for my own stupidity.

If the insurance companies had to regulate safety that is currently regulated by the government, you'd pay for it.

Where's our tax break?  Besides, I think that's a silly argument.  There's an auto mechanic down the road to fix my worthless car, should the need arise.  Should I be paying him a percentage out of all my financial transactions, just because he's there?<br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />If your local government doesn't have to spend as much money on fire trucks, then the local budget won't be as high, thus they won't need to tax you as heavily on every tranaction you make.  You <b>do</b> get a break if they don't need to spend the money.<br /><br />I'm also willing to bet that your volunteer fire department isn't all you've cracked it up to be.  More likely, it is a bunch of people who volunteer to help the "real" fire department if they run into something they need extra man power for.  For <i>real</i> emergencies, I'm sure there is a paid, professional fire department on call 24/7.<br /><br />Your mechanic analogy is quite flawed as well.  First of all, if you take your car to the mechanic, you have to <b>pay</b> him to fix it.  The fire department will not send you a bill when your lean-to burns down and they have to put it out.  If the fire department <i>did</i> send out bills (because they were privatized) you can bet your sweet ass the bills would be a hell of a lot more than you pay in taxes.  Then guess what happens?  You have to pay more on your fire insurance to cover the fire department bill, and the fire department would no longer go to homes that couldn't prove they could pay.<br /><br />Secondly, if your car is broken down at 3AM, you wait til the next morning to get it fixed.  That doesn't work for fire departments, they need to be there 24/7.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if you privatized all of the governmental agencies?

There are reasons things are done they way they are, whether you realize them or not.  To even pretend that you have some small semblance of an idea on how to run a nation of almost 300 million people all by yourself is absurd.  There are so many factors that are involved that you don't even have a clue about it is pitiful.  <br /><br />You haven't proven anything, you haven't shown that privatizing every aspect of the government will help anything.  All you've done is complain that you're getting services you don't want, even though you go back and want to utilize those services once you need them.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if the government didn't <i>require</i> hospitals (more specifically emergency rooms) to take in people regardless of whether they can pay or not, you'd probably be dead.  The free market would have dictated that the chances are you couldn't pay, so you would have been turned away.  Since no reputable doctor would have seen you (because you didn't have insurance), you would have been left with whatever you could find.  You might have been able to find some anibiotics, but who knows?  With no FDA to regulate drugs, you might have been sold sugar pills by a charlatan.  <br /><br />The idea of privatization of <i>some</i> government agencies in of itself isn't really all that bad, but the way you present it is stupid.  Your views are so extreme that they no longer make any sense.  To argue that the privatization of some government agencies might lower the burden on the tax payer is a noble idea if one can find a way to do so without endagering the citizens.  To say the government is robbing the citizens blind for no reason is simply stupidity.  To claim that you don't get anything you want for your tax dollars is dumb.  Yes, you probably pay for some things that you'll never use, but lots of other people have paid for things that you <i>do</i> use.</span></font></td>

The first thing most pioneers did once they had cleared a homestead was help build community organizations and buildings: militias, churches, schools and town councils.

As for the "somebody has to pay for it" bit, see my above post.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><br />Oh yeah, anyone with two brain cells to rub together could do a google search and figure out that following Mr. Schiff's advice to not pay taxes is indeed a bad idea.  In less than 5 minutes I found horror stories of people losing <i>millions</i> of dollars because they listened to that idiot.  If you don't like paying taxes, that's fine, you can complain about it all you want.  I don't think it's very nice to give people advice that could financially destroy them, or land them in prison.<br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Yeah, funny how the tax success stories get the same coverage as the convicted "Tax-evaders" isnt it?<br /><br />/sarcasm off<br /><br />What state do you live in?  I'll send you  list of REAL attorneys that are out to help ppl and not just make a buck or become a judge someday.  Maybe they can help you, too.
