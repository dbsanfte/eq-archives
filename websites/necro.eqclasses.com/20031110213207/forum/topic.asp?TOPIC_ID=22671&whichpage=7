Let me expand on my point, because I don't understand what you are saying at all.<br /><br />The author of the post you cite says that warriors have about 100 DPS with a Windblade.  He says that warrior have only 60 DPS with one-handed weapons (a number that he just pulls out of his ass, but let's accept it).  He then says that warriors have to use one-handers to hold taunt (a highly debatable proposition, but let's accept it).  Therefore, he reasons that a warrior can only do 60 DPS because of the taunt issue (which confuses taunt with snap aggro, but let's accept it).  He then says that paladins can do about 88 DPS with a Windblade (a number that he just pulls out of his ass, but let's accept it).  So therefore paladins have an advantage over warriors by 88 to 60.<br /><br />Now, let's suppose that SOE gave warriors snap aggro.  That would mean that warriors can return to doing 100 DPS.  Paladins would still have 88 DPS.  That means that warriors would have a sizable DPS advantage and equal taunt ability.  Adios, paladins.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote">That's exactly what I said. And if you reread more carefully this time, you will see that Warriors DO NOT WANT to be as good or better than Knights at snap-aggro, we just want to be comparble to them. Warriors do still have a small edge in damage absorption, mitigation, and DPS. Knights deserve an edge in snap-aggro, but not the double or nothing that they have now.<blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><i>Originally posted by Sleppen</i><br />But even with self-serving methodology, the author of that post concludes that paladins have 12% less DPS.

The exception is the paladin rez.  Otherwise, those abilities are considered to be nice (especially the paladin group heal), but when a group is picking a tank, they pick someone for their tanking ability.

They also have defensive, which rarely allows them to do things Knights simply cannot.<br /><br />However, in order to be a tank, the mob has to be fighting you, not the Healers and Slowers. As I said, if I had 1,000,000,000 HP, it wouldn't matter because the mob would be ping-ponging between the Healer and Slower. <i>Yes, I exaggerated the hell out of that, but hopefully it helps you understand that every single advantage Warriors have tanking over a Knight simply DOES NOT MATTER because they cannot get the mob to focus on them like a true tank has to be able to do.</i><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><i>Originally posted by Sleppen</i><br />History is the best evidence here.

Also, back then, gear was actually balanced a little bit between the classes so that PAL or SHD only gear (ie velious quest and kunark clicky armor) was inferior to WAR gear of that era. Unfortunately, all of the defining and restricting lines between Knights and Warriors have blurred to near-nonexistence, except that now Knights snap aggro is more important than ever and coupled with their gradual usurping of everything a Warrior used to hold over them, Knights are now the hands-down BEST choice for a Tank, there is no room for Warrior's anymore except the odd raid mob, and even then you're only satisfying one or two Warriors.<blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><i>Originally posted by Sleppen</i><br />Quit reading hysterical posts on the warrior boards and step back.

Well, duh.  But we're past that stage of the discussion.  We're talking about what would happen if warriors were given snap aggro.<br /><br />As an aside, I missed another error that Zurmakin made.  He said that paladins are equivalent to warriors defensively.  While it is true the paladins get the same cap for Defense, warriors have a higher cap for Parry (by 25), Dodge (by 20), and Riposte (by 25).

You will find the same thing on this board about necromancers.<br /><br />Warriors have a problem with snap aggro.  It's bad enough that I avoid playing my warrior alt and instead play my necromancer as much as I can.  The problem needs to be fixed.  The trick is to fix the problem without sending paladins and SKs back to where they were two years ago.  When you and Zurmakin try to say that warriors would not have a big advantage over paladins and SKs if they had snap aggro (or something "comparable but not as good as" snap aggro), you are just kidding yourselves.

In the best case that's only 240 points of hp for a warrior.<br /><br />You're continuing to kid yourself if you think people look for DPS when they want a tank. They look for agro and ability to take hits.<br /><br />And finally, wtf are you saying, the Paladin can give me Brell's? Sure, on raids. Do I go looking for Brell's when I'm in an xp group? Do you? Maybe Paladins should start raking in the big bucks selling Brell's in PoK? The Paladin brings that extra 330 HP to everyone in the group, but it's pretty fucking rare for anyone to invite a warrior into an xp group with a paladin, and the warrior doesn't tank if they do.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131942" target="_blank">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131942</a><br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89897" target="_blank">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89897</a><br /><br />Second one is my magelo, first one is the best Paladin in my guild. He can tank anything in an xp group that I can. Hell, he can tank anything in a raid that I can that doesn't require defensive, which is a lot of stuff.<br /><br />As far as Dodge/Parry/Riposte goes, when I parse those, it's highly dependent on the level of the mob. Mostly I'm parsing raid level mobs, where I manage to avoid about 30% of the incoming blows -- although this includes AC mitigating hits to 0 and so isn't necessarily a true measure.<br /><br />At any rate, we both know it doesn't matter that much. Why do we know that? Because Paladins are tanking in xp groups today JUST FINE. I'm sure there's a parsable difference there, but it's not that big. Paladins (and SK's) bring a lot to the table, but you insist that it's just rez. The necro in you is showing, since necros have a bitch about needing EE's to rez.<br /><br />Paladin stuns don't matter? SK snare doesn't matter? Brell's doesn't matter? SK lifetaps, don't matter? Feign death doesn't matter? WTF are you smoking?<br /><br />Listen, I play a 65 necromancer, 62 cleric, 57 enchanter, 63 mage -- and my 65 warrior. The ONLY reason I consider the warrior my main is because the guild needs him for raids. And when I'm xping on the other characters, I see first hand what people's attitude about warriors is. 1) Unless they're in an uber guild, people don't even bother. 2) Even if they are, they go for a Paladin first, an SK second, and the Warrior is a distant distant third. I've seen groups break up rather than take a Warrior tank.<br /><br />You play a necro main. Don't you *want* to be more than a weak wizard and a mana whore in LDoN zones? Because with a warrior tanking, that's all you can do. Thule gets agro if you put it in too fast. FP gets agro if you stack it. I don't even want to think about what Horror will do. It's to the point where if a warrior is tanking in my group, I nuke and tap, because even Thule doesn't run full when you have to wait 20s to put it in.<br /><br /><br /></span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

Until melee is balanced, he will sleep.  What I can say, is it's more than discouraging having every other melee class do your job better than you can (dps, take agro, hold agro...take your pick).<br /><br />  When I first bought EQ 3 years ago, my guide that came with the game said warriors were the top dog of tanking with 'superior hp and ac'..SK's and pally's were secondary to warriors, but had the ability to take agro at anytime and tank if needed.  SK's and paladins should NOT be the first choice for a tank anymore than a druid is the first choice for a healer if there is a cleric around.<br /><br /><br />Being able to mitigate damage better than an SK or Pally doesnt mean jack shit if I'm not getting hit.  I don't know if giving warriors 'snap agro' is the proper way to balance things out, but warriors need to have the abilities to HOLD agro.  <br /><br /><br />hmmm... how about AoT...(agro over time) procs or abilities  ;)</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

We both agree that warriors have a problem with snap aggro.  We both agree that warrior HPs do not help the warrior taunt the mob.<br /><br />What we are discussing is the effect on paladins and SKs if warriors got snap aggro (or even some "comparable but not as good as" snap aggro).  Zurmakin said that paladins would be fine because they have equivalent DPS, HPs, and defensive skills to warriors.  I showed that he was wrong, and that paladins would therefore suffer if they lost their snap aggro advantage.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote">You need to be careful to understand the distinction between Knight, Paladin, and Shadow Knight. Knight is both of the latter, and it is what is in contention. I agree that Knights do not have <i>equivalent</i> defensive skills as Warriors, but they are so close that the difference is almost invisible. I won't pretend to hide the fact that the Knight grouping frenzy will slacken when Warrior's are brought up to speed. As it stands, Knights are TOO good. Warrior's being marginally equivocalized will only balance out the Who can Tank? question so that any of the 3 classes able will have the same chance of being chose for the duty. Of course, that's not quite fair, because Warrior's still have the raid advantage, so Warrior's can't be as good as Knights.<blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><i>Originally posted by Sleppen.</i><br />As an aside, I missed another error that Zurmakin made.  He said that paladins are equivalent to warriors defensively.  While it is true the paladins get the same cap for Defense, warriors have a higher cap for Parry (by 25), Dodge (by 20), and Riposte (by 25).  I've never seen any data on the effect of those higher caps, but that's a fairly large difference.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote">See Zurmakin's post for this. In summary: a very small percentage of attacks are actually Parried/Dodged/Riposted. I don't have factual numbers, but I can tell you that the difference here is miniscule.<blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><i>Originally posted by Sleppen.</i><br />Yes, and I think you've lost your ability to look at this issue with any measure of objectivity.  I play a warrior, too, you know.  I know exactly what the taunt problems are like.  I also know that a lot of warriors have worked themselves into a lather trying to convince themselves that the class totally sucks.  You will find the same thing on this board about necromancers.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote">I don't think we think suck, I think we're mad because everyone else does (but they are finally learning otherwise).<blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"><i>Orginally posted by Sleppen.</i><br />Warriors have a problem with snap aggro.  It's bad enough that I avoid playing my warrior alt and instead play my necromancer as much as I can.  The problem needs to be fixed.  The trick is to fix the problem without sending paladins and SKs back to where they were two years ago.  When you and Zurmakin try to say that warriors would not have a big advantage over paladins and SKs if they had snap aggro (or something "comparable but not as good as" snap aggro), you are just kidding yourselves.  The actual data toasts your arguments.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote">All the data I've seen shows that Warrior's have a small advantage over Knights and that the biggest problem of Knight's snap-aggro (which they have always had) is that now they can tank so close to as well as a Warrior can, their snap-aggro has an entirely different meaning. It went from an ability that didn't mean anything because Knight's were made of paper to a game-breaking role reversal.<br /><br />Here's my summary of our argument:<ul><li>Azumaan thinks that Knight DPS is close to Warrior's due to the superior ratios available on Knight-only weapons and their self-imbue procs (<- new point). Sleppen disagrees because Knight weapon skills cap 25 points lower and Offense 27 points lower. (by the way, that only gives Knights 156 less ATK than Warrior's, each skill point gives +3 ATK (<- new point).</li><li>Azumaan thinks Warrior's are only slightly better tanks than Knights (because of higher AC, HP, Parry/Dodge/Riposte caps) and that Warrior's gain no major advantage because of this. Sleppen thinks Knight's are at a major disadvantage to Warrior's because of their lower-capping avoidance skills and HP/AC.</li><li>Azumaan thinks that, since Knights are so close in their ability to tank as Knights, their monopoly on aggro is unfair. Sleppen thinks they deserve it since they suck at tanking (worse mitigation, few hundred less HP, 20-25 point lower caps).</li><li>Azumaan knows that Warrior's have a special place on raids that Knights simply cannot fill and Knights need some kind of bone to keep them happy. Sleppen knows this too.</li><li>Azumaan thinks that Warrior's need to have some snap-aggro, but not as good as Knights. Sleppen doesn't think this is possible</li></ul>I know I missed some stuff and generalized a bit. If it doens't make complete since, I'm sorry - I walked away from the computer amidst writing that and probably lost my train of thought.<br /><br />Anyway, the most important bit is the last one - whether or not Warrior's can get snap aggro that is enticing enough for Warrior's to get back into groups, but not so enticing as to throw Knights back into the cold where they should not be.<br /><br />It also seems like there is something I am forgetting to mention. If it's obvious, I'm sure someone will point it out and I'll hit it then. :)<br /><br />EDIT: Oh ya, your most recent post, Sleppen.<br /><br />You talk about how it isn't possible for Warriors to get snap aggro without killing Knight's role in tanking for EXP groups. Their existence will remain because of Paladin stuns, group heals, Brell's, root, etc. and Shadow Knight snares, pet dps, dot dps,  VERY quick casting nukes (good gate-stoppers), group taps, life taps, FD etc. Yes, these have always existed, but they were never given a proper light to shine because Knights were such crappy tanks back then. Now that they are good tanks, these abilties are becoming more relied on by groups and when Warrior's get some snap aggro, groups will start inviting Warrior's again, but they (the group members) will miss all of the things mentioned above that Knights contribute and a proper balance between effeciency (Warrior) and ease/relaxation (Knight) should be achieved when groups decided what type of group they want to have.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>

Let me put it this way -- I am not aware of any knight two-hander that is unbalancing at any level of the game.  If there is one out there, I've just never heard of it.<br /><br />As for the skill caps, the rogue data shows that a 10 point difference in weapon skill translates to a 5-10 percent reduction in DPS.  If you extrapolate that data to the 25 point difference in weapon skills for knights, that is at least a 12.5 percent reduction in DPS.  If you add in the 27 point difference in Offense, then it is conceivable that the DPS difference is 25 percent, which is what SOE has said that it intends.

Knights have not recently gone from being "crappy tanks" to being "good tanks."  The only thing that really changed was that snap aggro became important.  As of the Velious expansion, the HP/AC gap between the two classes narrowed, and warriors started bitching about it.  All of the other stuff (aside from paladin rezzes) is pretty much junk.  If you want healing, you get a healer.  If you want buffing, you get a buffer.  If you want nuking, you get a nuker.  If you want pet DPS, you get a pet class.  But if you want tanking, you get a tank.<br /><br />You are forced to speculate about what groups might do.  My view is based on what groups really did before snap aggro became such a big deal.

The real, non-hypothetical data shows a difference of about 1000 HPs and 100 AC at the high end, and caps on parry, dodge, and riposte that are 20-25 points higher.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />And at the VT level, it's 700 HP and about 20 AC apparently, at least in my case. Hmm, and at the low-end, it's what? 400 HP and no AC?<br /><br />You realize that a Time-equipped Knight (the high end you refer to) has no problem tanking in xp groups, right?<br /><br />You realize that a VT-equipped Knight has no problem tanking in XP groups, right?<br /><br />You additionally realize that a low-end equipped Knight has no problem tanking in most XP groups, including for sure LDoN normal adventures, right?<br /><br /><br /><br />GIVEN ALL OF THAT -- what is your basis for claiming that Knight will not be used for tanking if Warriors have an ability to hold agro that somewhat approaches a Knight's?<br /><br />Especially given that, at the low end, their buffs make up for all of the HP gap you have identified, and actually give them an AC advantage...<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">Zurmakin's post has no data on this.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Actually, I said that parses showed I avoid 30% incoming blows on raid-level mobs. For instance the Bertox event, I managed to avoid (or mitigate to 0) 30% of the blows from Kings and trash both. So at most the difference in avoidance caps will affect 30% of the total damage taken. Meaning, without evidence, that if 20% of the avoidance I get is from higher avoidance caps (I think this is an extremely excessive estimate) -- then a Knight is seeing approximately 6% more damage than I am. And that's the HIGH estimate. The real winner is defensive, which reduces the damage I take by (typically) around 40%... And defensive is not often used in XP groups.<br /><br />And again, I state experientially something that should be obvious on the face of it. Knights are tanking in XP groups successfully. In fact, the groups that have Knight tanks are far more efficient than the groups that have Warrior tanks. Therefore, Knights are good tanks today.<br /><br />If Warriors were good xp tanks, it would mean that the three would compete for xp groups equally. You keep stating that this is not the case, but I have yet to see why your typical XP group would refuse to take a Knight, given that Knights are already capable of such a high level of efficiency.</span id="msg"></font><br><br></td>
