I like the message boards, it allows people to input and let out steam, or whatever. However, I can't believe that they dropped they other part of the site. Now we have to wait for someone to post something before we even have an idea. For example, I hunt in zoneA at camp1 and I do okay, but it is slow. Another guy hunts in zoneC at camp9 and makes better XP and actually gets word drops and some cash. I am clueless to the layout of zoneC, and I wouldn't even know that camp9 exists. Now I have to wait for someone else to post this revelation, and then I have to weed through stupid posts, and interesting posts to find it. Basically having to read every f**king post to find what I'm looking for. I don't know, maybe I'm way off base, but all the other necro sites out there are n00bish bullshit and are not helpful. This site is the best Necro site out there, it's just a little cock-eyed.</P><P> </font></td>

"Necro's Are Gods and Why Do we As Druids Suck" I Guarantee that post will be deleted. </P><P>At least here, if you say something you dont have to worry if your post will be seen.

I have been with this site since around that time frame, can't remember for sure if this site has been up that long, I think it has though. I haven't really ever posted on this site till recently, I was on a brief hiatus and came back to find all my characters deleted. So I had to start all over again. I remember when this site was full of information with Hunting Guides, Necro Quests, and Gear. I also remember when it changed format to all post. After coming back and seeing the recent nerfs as well as that post by Zondro, I couldn't take it anymore, I had to post something. As for my wish for solid hunting guides to come back, I have recently read some posts that allude to the fact that it's being worked on. So this rant post is really moot now.</P><P>Finally I have no idea who Ilano is other than a guy who posts on here, don't even think he's a player on Veeshan. As for this e-mail address, I'm not a fake, and I have no idea where it came from. Personally I can't see that it's all that bad if some of you can't spam my e-mail account though, heh.</P><P> </font></td>
