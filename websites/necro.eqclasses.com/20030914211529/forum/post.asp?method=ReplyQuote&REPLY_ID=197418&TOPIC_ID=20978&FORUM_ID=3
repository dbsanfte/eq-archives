[br]It doesn't take a genious to figure out how to play a necro, so skipping a few non-spell levels here and there isn't really anything bad; the same tactics are employed for the majority of your EQ career.  Besides calling playing EVERY level fun is just a lie, I seriously doubt anyone ENJOYS playing every level or part of a level.  Every once in a while it's nice to jump ahead of the game a little bit.

I have know that I have not wanted to PL my Necro. I am in a guild where most members are 65s and have alts who are higher than my now 47 Necro.  I have only logged 15days played. I think this is very good seeing that I am a master baker/tailor/brewer/smith and all of my skills i.e. sense heading and swimming are all maxed for my level.  I have also made it a point to ensure that my casting skills are all maxed for my level. I waste a lot of time making sure that all of these "anal" tendencies are in order. To me it is not a waste. I have been soloing Dulak's since 45 before that I spent a lot of time in City of Mist. I feel like I got a good grasp on how to play my character and if I would have PLed I know for a fact that I would be totally lost.  Unlike some of the alts out there, I am new to EQ and thus making it essential for me to learn the zones and spells and all of the good things about the game. PLing would have made it too easy for me to skip all of this. Pling an Alt......more "power" to ya, if your a NewB like me, just stick with it, play and learn your character and the zones. You will get owned if you PL and end up in Bastion of Thunder with a group and you don't know how to play other than /pet attack and life taps. The Necromancer is so so much more. I have rambled on long enough, I know this hasn't helped anyone but maybe it will provide some insight to you toons out there making a decision on PLing.<br /><img src="http://www.moonlightcrusaders.com/news/tomandny.bmp" border="0"></span></font></td>

I got him PLed with only HP/AC buffs on me and pet and KEI for me (before nerf).  I tanked the mobs with my pet to max my defense skills and then I went to different zones (PC, Unrest, etc.) to make sure I worked on all my casting skills.  I also only had newbie quest armor (broke, new server).<br /><br />The thing that ircs me is buying a character via PlayerAuctions or the like.  You buy a maxxed 65 Necro with 200 AA and don't know what half of them are for.  THen you try to join my group and draw agro so much that you're slowing exp down and leaching Cleric mana.

Anyone can press the f3ar and sn@r3 buttons, but only people who truly know how to play the class will be able to pull it off when they get two adds. I don't care, PL yourself and be a gimp Necro.

You gave a list of who usually pulls in one of your earlier posts, metro. I'd just like a show of hands from everyone that believes I am right when I am removed from a group for constantly bitching about a chanter that's pulling (when we had a TWO monks, a ranger, me, and a bard). I make it a point to get as many people to hear that as possible, cause the argument lasted several days... and I still /duel anyone that contests it.<br /><br /><br />I'd also like to say the following: don't bother PLing... just twink heavily. Spend a week farming plat, and just twink. I personally hate twinking, and have never done it, but really... it's just kind of pathetic that you PL. I come from Sullon, so my opinion concerning PLing is biased (if you see a person from another alliance being PLed, you die.) but nonetheless, if you want to level fast it's easier and more fun just to twink. <br /><br />One last issue: the initial discussion in this topic amused me. A LOT. If you have SOMEHOW gotten a 65 Cleric, 65 Mage, 59 Chanter and then you need to go to a forum to find out where and how to PL a necro into level 40, you've got problems. And you said: "62cleric,61mage,30chanter"... oh, really? Well, to PL with such a LOW LEVEL crowd, you must be talented. You've got to be kidding... I could readily PL with just a lvl 40 cleric, no problem.<br /><br />One last thing, you said "Flame if you want.I don't care.", well I suppose that was tested by Lethe and it would seem that you do care.</span></font></td>

But by all the time it was a general thing, like most of the time which is prolly what I should've said anyway.  And I still don't see the point on how skipping 2 levels at trivial times makes me less knowledgable.  Anyway I might shoot you a tell in game sometime.<br /><br />And I hope you're kidding about guilds not rejecting people because of gear.  Have you seen how many apps get rejected on other, better servers because of inferior gear?  I mean, a sk with 4k hp and an elemental piece or two will normally get rejected from TR and AL, the 2 uberest guilds... no matter what they play like.

I <b>did</b> say IF you want to pl your way to the top, go for it. But you sure were defensive on that point. hmmm...<br /><br />2) I did NOT say I automatically new more than you because I had more character leveled higher. In fact, I said that did NOT mean I knew all about, or more, than a person who was pl'ed of another class JUST because I've grouped with them extensively. Read the second part of that sentence, please. I was applying YOUR logic of knowing as much just because of being around them and having a high level char.<br /><br />3) I've raided quite a lot. I also see Bards and SK's pull quite a lot, not just monks, rangers, and necros. It's situational, but again, the same tactics do NOT always apply, but you said they do. I've even been in groups that, because of the make-up, sometimes the CLERIC had to pull. I've been in some groups where, when I was a rogue, I did, indeed, pull, using sneak pulling tactics. Check it out at Safehouse. They talk about it. It's where I first read up on it and learned how, in situational moments, it can work quite well. I was nearly always the puller when I was leveling in DL...because I could pull one mob out from a batch of them, when we didn't have an FD/Lull puller. You think that's a mistake? Then you aren't making full use of some of the lesser-known abilities of some people. Unusual tactics that aren't the norm, and you may not know unless you've actually worked the class to learn them. I've been in groups where some classes were indeed told to hold off, because of the peculiarities of a mob. I've seen them have to use spells they wouldn't normally use to achieve a different effect than a "basic tactic". I've watched over the shoulder of a Valon person, during MANY raids, and asked why they were doing some things I've never seen before. EVER. I was told "It's how you have to do it, or the raid will wipe. I've been in raids where I could only attack momentarily and then had to back off, because of the pecuiliar habits of a mob. Again, not basic tactics. I trust a tank that knows just how to spin a mob on a dime for repositioning so that the raid could maximize their effects. Something not a lot of majorly pl'ed tanks know how to do. It's something you learn from trial and error...something you don't learn when you've got ubers keeping you alive so you can 1-person zerg a mob with insane buffs.<br /><br />4) I have yet to see a guild, even Valon or CtV, turn people down because of their gear. That was an incredibly funny remark. Once in, and proven they know what the hell they are doing, THEN they get to earn the great gear WITH them. Again. Seen it. My honey is IN Valon. Practical knowledge... They put a person's ability to do their job in an exceptional manner over the gear they have when they look for people. If you have awesome gear, but are severely lacking in ability, they *may* try to work with you for a VERY short period of time, but they prefer to take in people that know what the hell they are doing. You can have the best gear on the server, but if you don't know how to handle a certain situation because of lack of experience in it, you can cause the raid to wipe. Yes...ONE person doing something they shouldn't, can cause a whole raid to wipe. Seen that as well. More than once.<br /><br />Phat Lewtz and level aren't the be-all end-all. Knowing your class is infinitely more desireable. I've grouped with people in BoT with great gear who were total screw ups...I'd take one with lesser gear but knows what they are doing in a heartbeat. Even there, One idiot in the group can wipe the whole group. Hell, they can wipe several in their idiocy. Raids wipe more often from lack of knowledge than lack of gear. Gear helps, but is nothing compared to ability to play one's class well.<br /><br />Oh, and as a return shot, just for giggles... You laughed at me being level 24 for 3 days? In my very limited play schedule, I got through 55 in one night with a normal leveling group. How many days have you been 55 now? ;) (Now, THAT was a joke...see...I can understand when people don't live and breathe, eat and drink, EQ as their only means for existence. I'm sure you have been busy doing other things...)</span></font></td>

Also, the best players I've seen have done MOST if not all the leveling on their own, but I don't care, as long as a tank knows how to pull properly it's fine.  It's the gear that distinguishes people these days.  Would I rather have a slightly less knowledgable tank that has phatlewt gear that he got by twinking, or a home-grown slightly more intelligent tank with his own quested armor?  I'd take the bloody twink every time.  Plus, I've been pled through like 2 levels, wow, so calling me a totally PLed char is just a blatant lie (i.e. making you a liar =P)  And in fact, I have been on some raids in my time, from what I've experienced, most of the things hold true for most raids.  Chanters and Druids ALWAYS buff up the raid before you go.  Monks or Tanks are ALWAYS the pullers, and if not then Rangers and Necros pull.  Chanters/Shamans ALWAYS slow if possible, Wizards ALWAYS sit back and nuke, SK's/Pallies/Warriors ALWAYS tank, rogues ALWAYS throw in dps while backstabbing.  Ever heard of a rogue pulling, if so it was a mistake.  Ever heard of a chanter tanking, hell I have, but it was for giggles.  So, I question how much you've raided, I haven't done much myself but I read up on them, i.e. TR Boards, SoW boards, FoH etc etc.  I don't know what kinda raids you've had with characters doing zany things that you wouldn't expect, but characters do the same things because that's what people have found to be most effective.  There are exceptions as always, but for the most part, classes stick to the norm when possible on raids.  Plus, these days, some homegrown start-from-scratch char might now his stuff, but do u see uberguilds taking people who just know how to play the class. Hell no.  They look for that and phatlewtz and HP etc etc.  So go and have a character from scratch, go quest for your own stuff, take forever to be raidable whatever you like.  All I know is that skipping a few levels here and there isn't such a bad thing, hell does skipping a day of school make you less smart than you already are?  Does skipping a day of work mean you're not as good at your job as you were before?  And how stupid are you that you need all your levels done by yourself to know your class, people with a regular amount of intelligence can get the grip of things quite quickly.  This thread has turned into a giant rant between you and me, all because you think because you've done all the work yourself you're all high and mighty.  All it does is prove you're really anal retentive.<br /><br />And one last thing, calling my material a reach...badly, someone else can judge that, but I think it's more of a reach to say that you've got 11 characters to high levels, therefore your opinion is better.  Hypocrite.</span></font></td>

I said I am enjoying every last level, learning everything I can along the way. You said that was a lie. That's calling me a liar. Period. Of course I'm going to lose respect for a guild who harbours people who call others a liar without grounds. Saying someone has lied is calling them a liar. Don't try to get into a semantics war with me... And I haven't been level 24 for 3 days...Just 2. I work. I'm gone 12+ hours a day for my job. That does NOT mean I have another 12 that I can spend online. I have to sleep, do things around the house, etc. I'm married, too. What time I have free is spent in EQ. And in the 3 years now I've been in the game, I've raised 8 characters to 50-54, 3 characters to 55-60, and 1 to 65 with nearly 100 aa's. All leveled "the old fashioned way," in my spare time, without pl'ing, and with level appropriate groups when it's required grouping to do. Work hard at leveling? Yes and no... I PLAY... It's not <b><i>WORK</i></b> to me. I take my time, learn what I'm doing, learn to do it right... Trying to bite off a bit more each time and applying what I learned so far to try for a harder target. I'm not in a race with anyone to reach 65. I have a 65. It's nothing special, IMHO...just different. VERY different. WORLDS apart different. But it's not..."better". I don't feel inadequate because I'm not ubar_pled_necro_27, thank you. I'm happy that your attempted dig on how long YOU think I'm taking to level makes you feel better. <br /><br />The remark about questioning your level was rhetorical, based on your apparent lack of knowing that the same basic tactics do NOT always apply. If you've raided a lot, you'd know this. Look around even right here, around the necromancer forums. Fairly high level people asking others what tactics they may need to employ for certain tasks, and having some unusual things listed. Again...ask Augsian, for a good person to ask. He was one of the biggest ones on informing me things will change drastically in the post 55 game...and even moreso post 60. "A lot of tactics just won't work anymore here, but tell me when you get up there and I'll show you the ropes, so you don't die a lot like I did" were his words.<br /><br />Unless you've got several characters as high as all my other ones just sitting around here and there, can I apply your logic and say I'm a better necro than you are, because I learned more by watching? No...I don't think so...<br /><br />Like I said...you want to pl your way to the top, instead of taking the conventional way of learning your class as you go, that's all fine and dandy for you. I have a guarded opinion of the abilities of those who do it, as compared to those who've done it the conventional way. Not for their lack of having the character skills/spells, but of having the practical working experience. I'd trust the likes of other names I listed, as opposed to anyone who's been pl'ed up because they weren't even patient enough to work their way up, in a heartbeat. I'd follow one of several lone necros into the jaws of death before I'd follow a whole group of pl'ed to the the top people.<br /><br />Tanatus, Dweia, Augsian, Klaacker, Heparin... Some of the best necros in the game that I actually know. I'd follow them just the two of us before I'd follow a whole group of pl'ed twinks... Because I know they learned through multiple trials by fire.</span></font></td>

Necros fearkite most of the time, or Aggrokite.  In groups we sic pet and dot, we pull yadayada.  That happens the whole game.  Wizards sit back and nuke, all the time, that's their whole role, they do employ the same tactics every game.  Warriors usually pull and tank, they do that the whole game.  Chanters mez and slow and debuff while playing the aggro game, they do that as soon as they can too.  I could go on for most classes, but the majority of an EQ characters life is doing the same thing, notice how almost all the guides on this site pre-51 are geared towards fearkiting, simply replacing low spells with higher ones as you level.  I wasn't planning on flaming you and such, I really didn't have bad intentions until I read the line about you giving me crap about not being 55, people work hard to level, and don't need people like you giving them BS.

I can tell the druid, necro, wizard, etc who has leveled him/herself, usually, apart from those that were powerleveled when they hit the high levels and are now trying to solo without that safety net of a healer, mana whore, pet buffer, etc... They tend to die a LOT more often because they lack the survival skills needed in drastic situations...because they've never been in them. They've had a druid, cleric, shaman, or whomever else as their hand-holder and life-saver. I see it a lot...too much. Especially in places like PoN and HoH. It's scary. You can know all the spells in your arsenal, and you can read until the words themselves fade from the pages over the aeons, but until you're in a sticky situation, with nothing to save you but your own one character, nearly oom and half dead, your pet getting chewed up too fast for words, you don't know near as much as you think you do. I've seen these people train whole groups...GROUPS of groups, because they were ill-equipped, knowledge-wise, to save themselves.<br /><br />In the whole of my combined lives in EQ, I have never trained anyone... I spent my time learning my character, and my craft. I took my time doing this. Not a race to the ph47 13vv7z at the end. As an example, I spent all my time last night not leveling... I spent it researching my level 24 spells. I enjoyed every chilling second of going to places where I was near, and at, kos, just to scrounge for what I needed to summon a more powerful skeleton. And again to learn the craft to make my minion more powerful. It was a rush, as a human necromancer, to go into the outpost where I'm a hair's breadth from KoS to a LOT of really powerful, mean creatures and dark elves...not to mention the army of skeletons...just to search for that one elusive word I'd yet to find from slaying a monster. I'm learning when it's best to feign (or try to, as it sometimes fizzles and I find myself in excrutiating pain), when it's best to fear, when it's best to snare and run, and when it's best to throw my hands up in the air and call to the great Innoruuk to release me from the pain I'm about to be subjected to... Something a lot of people who are PL'ed do NOT know until they've killed a few OTHER people in their johnny-come-lately efforts to learn.<br /><br />I'll admit, there's people who DO level without the aid of powerlevelers who are also, at times, just as feeble in these situations...usually solo-capable people who never solo until later in life... Or Toohotforu who's just...not that bright and has left corpses, his own and others, throughought every zone in the game because they just don't..."get it". lol But they are few and far between, by comparison. I've played alongside a beastlord in a Tier 3 raid guild who just went 8 ways from sunday nuts with cowardly commentary when we wanted to do Oreen Wavecrasher at east pad in BoT... Our party consisted of a druid for healing, him, a rogue, a ranger, a paladin, and a mage. "We don't have a slower that can slow him, so we can't do him." Not "it might be tough, but let's try it..." He said CAN'T. well...the ranger pulled him anyways. GO RANGER! it was rough, but we did it... This guy then left the group, saying we were idiots... Yeah, I watched him leapfrog levels from PL'ers always saving his hairy arse and giving him boosts a level appropriate group could never give him.<br /><br />Okay...On the flip side... I HAVE, indeed, met a few people who were powerleveled to the higher levels and know their stuff. But they are the exception to the rule, as far as I've been able to see. You also have to remember that this is from my perspective, as I have seen many a group I was in pay for the inexperiences of a pl'ed person. You cannot tell me that someone who's never been in any real danger because of pl assistance is going to be as effective later on as someone who's been in the situation many many more times and has learned what they need to do and so doesn't lose their cool, run around like an idiot, screwing up the heal, aggro, etc... It just doesn't equate. I've seen people who've played for YEARS...since beta...who, after being bored with their main that they really do play VERY well, pl an alt. I mean 1-50 in 4 days played. And although they knew the game on their main quite well...they were poor, and deadly, to groups whether they were solo or grouped, when on that alt. Skills upped because they bought them...their tools for the job there, but their knowledge of how THAT class must do things in certain situations seriously lacking. I've watched a necro who's been playing a necro the "old fashioned way" since beta solo level 63+ named in HoH at R3 (i think? wayyyyy down deep...I don't know HoH camp names very well) that was unsnareable... It was a sight to behold. And I've watched level 60 pl'ed necros die to a single underbulk in PoD because they were clueless about basic, required survival skills... They no longer had mommy Druid/Cleric's skirt-tails to hide under... I've talked to some pl'ed solo-gods (meaning the class, like necro,m druid, wizard, etc) who won't solo in some places that are a veritable treasure trove for them because they don't think it can be done. The only thing I can attribute this to is lack of real knowledge of their class, beyond what Lucy says about their spells.<br /><br />Again...I'm not saying this is always the case, but a goodly portion of the time, more than 75%, it is. It's easily seen. Yes, some who did it the old-fashioned way are just as lost and deadly to anyone close...but they are rare, in comparison to a total class count. Just as likewise, there are those who are pl'ed who seem to know their class inside and out... I would still stand by my statement that there's no way they intrinsically know their class as well as someone who learned "the hard way", by actually leveling, instead of having someone else level for them (pl'ing). It's not possible.<br /><br />And I will also stand by my statement that anyone who says "you employ the same basic tactics throughout the majority of your eq career" can't possibly be over level...oh...51... Or all they do is sit in KC all day... (PoN = KC v2.1, imho) I've got a few high level, and some well known to the TT server, necro friends. I have spoken to them about the tactics they advise, and they all tell me how radically different some places can be, and how the post-55 game for the soloing necro takes on a whole different light, unless you stick with the same mobs you were fighting at 50... Even though you may use aggro kiting almost exclusively at this level, different areas, and different monsters, will require completely different tactics to drop. Some require fear/aggro/fear/aggro "yo-yo" effects, etc. I've played a few classes to the post 55 game and on every single class, the tactics are NOT the same...many times not even a loose similarity...to what the pre-55 game was like. And raids? A whole other animal altogether...and can be vastly different for each class, mob to mob... It's NOT "the same basic tactics" at all.<br /><br />Anyways... Sorry for the rant... But this started out as me expressing my opinion on people taking the shortcut instead of taking the time to learn all the nuances of the class. Any class. And was called a liar. Again, my apologies.</span></font></td>

WIth a druids method, everything is faster but the lowbie still has to do all the work. With my necro, as I mentioned before there is simply less downtime than the already little downtime necessary. Heals, buffs and taxi.<br /><br />The memwipe method is poor simply because the lowbie ends up not actually doing anything but taking the last couple whacks. As a result, their important secondary skills suffer (e.g. defense). I'm pleased that my necro meleed up to 30 or so, because her defense is relatively high. As I mentioned above, her skills are where the should befor her level... except I realized that her divination should get PL'd a bit too...but at 35 it is already too late for her to ever really work on her defense skill. Mobs just hit too hard, so she can't really tank anymore, except for a few seconds. <br /><br />Anyway, I think of Powerleveling as unproblematic when it's a solitary activity, i.e. if you can do it yourself, then it probably won't be a problem. If you have to get someone else to do it for you, you shouldn't be doing it.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">Those who got pl'ing, "jumping levels" seemed to lack a certain...something...<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />I think that's only true when they don't understand the game.

It's not a lie. I've enjoyed every level so far. I have done a few different classes to post 50, 2 to post 55, and one to 65 and a buttload of aa's. I've played alongside people from various classes who've been pl'ed, and some who haven't... And I've seen one thing glaringly apparent. Those who got pl'ing, "jumping levels" seemed to lack a certain...something... If you've never done that last level before new spells, so your dots, dd's, pet, regen, everything is rather weak, then what do you do when that situation arises later in the game, when the pl'ing is done? I've grouped with cowardly rangers at 65 who were afraid to, and flat-refused, to do a dangerous pull...talking to them I discovered yep...they were pl'ed. They didn't know HOW to fannegle (sp?) their abilities to pull it off, not twenty minutes after I watched someone who did it in what I personally call "the right way" found that even doing the dangerous way was boring compared to the tight situations they've squeaked out of because they've faced them, not had an army of ubers protecting their danty arses while they were growing up. ;)<br /><br />Hey...if you want to go that route, be my guest...I'm not saying you shouldn't... I'm saying MY opinion on it after I've grouped with plenty. I've grouped with pl'ed shaman who were the sorriest lot I've ever met and didn't have a clue the PROPER time to slow based on situation because of it. I've grouped with pl'ed wizards who were totally friggin' clueless about the fact they could overnuke, and die, when they were all grown up. I've watched pl'ed clerics who REFUSE to use anything but cheal, because the boards told them it was more efficient, and then die because they now magically have aggro from chealing the MT who was low health. These kinds of things I see as COMMON amongst pl'ed people, and rarely amongst those who have taken the route of learning through play. There's exceptions, like say you've ALREADY leveled a shaman the hard way...you decide you want to pl another one, maybe another race, or spend your points different? I doubt that pl'ed person is going to have many issues.<br /><br />Just because you read a message board devoted to a class and have played alongside them doesn't give a person one iota of true knowledge of the class and the sometimes precarious interdependencies of their spells and skills that leveling it up through all the levels would.<br /><br />Back to the first paragraph... I am enjoying being a necromancer now. I am enjoying every last level and the unique situations that come to each of those levels due to the differing creatures I must face and the change in the powers of my abilities as I advance in level and they stagnate until a new circle of learning is at hand. I giggle every time I try something that works, that, if I'd have been pl'ed, I would have NEVER known I could do, for I never would have been in the situation before...and may be reluctant to try, or tell others wasn't possible, later in life. I do not have spells cast on myself, or my pet, from anyone outside a level appropriate group... Oh wait! I don't group. Strictly solo. I don't go pay an uber mage for items to toss on my pet. I am getting more enjoyment out of every last little thing that I can do than I've seen from a few necro's I know that were pl'ed...or any other class for that matter.<br /><br />Now, I started off speaking my personal opinion...and you called me a liar... and here I had a lot more respect from Bloodhorde members. My old main is a former SU and I fought alongside many of them and not once been called a liar. My respect for the guild has fallen a notch or three, sadly...<br /><br />Oh...and to this comment:<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">the same tactics are employed for the majority of your EQ career.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />Are you sure you're level 55?

Besides calling playing EVERY level fun is just a lie, I seriously doubt anyone ENJOYS playing every level or part of a level.  Every once in a while it's nice to jump ahead of the game a little bit.</span></font></td>
