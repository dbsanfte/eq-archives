<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Trolls are vile creatures born in the harsh environment of the

Innothule Swamps. They are primitive savage creatures, evil

intelligent beasts. They prefer to be solitary, and have an

extreme dislike for following the orders of others. Trolls speak

a primitive tongue that is hard to understand even by those who

are well versed in the language. They distrust other races

thinking that they can only trust themselves.</font> </p>



<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Trolls are the monsters that mothers tell their children about

while putting them to bed. They view both animals and intelligent

creatures as an equal source of food. Trolls are careful to stay

down wind while stalking their prey and can move with surprising

stealth for there size and bulk.</font> </p>



<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">They prefer dark and dank environments. And are always on the

look out for caves and crevices to call there own. Humans refer

to such places as &quot;Troll Holes&quot;. Troll Holes are filthy

places were few living things will go, a Troll will live out of a

single cave or crevice until the entire surrounding area has been

depleted of food.</font> </p>



<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">On the battlefield trolls are usually disorganized and

chaotic. They rarely follow orders and when they do it's usually

by accident. They are terrifying opponents to face, their

predatory instincts often drive them to attack the weakest

members of an opposing army, which is often the mages and

clerics. Many also fear them for their regenerative abilities...

it is said that a troll can never truly be killed. That given

enough time they will always come back no matter how horrible the

injuries... they're right.</font> </p>

  </u></strong>In the primitive and instinctive minds of Trolls one word

stands out above all the rest, &quot;survive&quot;... survival at

all costs. The best way to stay alive is to kill the competition,

these are words that the Troll Warrior has taken to heart. Troll

Warriors are just as clever as their Shadow Knight and Shaman

counterparts. But they have an advantage, Warriors are more

willing to work as a team. Warriors will often times form small

hunting packs that seek out and destroy the

&quot;competition&quot;. Every member of the pack looks out for

himself and only himself, but there is still much safety in

numbers. Once the pack grows tired of killing it will disband and

its members will usually forget each other.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Groups of five or six Troll Warriors (occasionally accompanied

by a Shadow Knight or Shaman) roam the countryside killing the

weak and the sick. If they can catch you, you're food. This is

part of the reason trolls are so hated, packs are dangerous.

While leaders are rare within a pack the members seem to fight

with one mind, all traveling in the same direction and ALWAYS

fighting the same opponent, targeting the small and weak first.

Children do not leave their homes when a pack is in the area. And

when they do they are rarely seen again.</font> </p>

  <br>
  </a>Troll Shadow Knights are the very definition of independence.

Even when in a group they will often stand apart from the crowed

thinking and plotting. Unlike other Trolls, Shadow Knights have a

thirst for power and even less respect for authority than most

Trolls. For some, their disrespect is so great that they disdain

the very gods that give them power. If a Troll Shadow Knight

could figure out how, he would rule the world. And if he couldn't

rule it, he would destroy it. Troll Shadow Knights are more

intelligent about worldly things such as mechanics and magic than

most warriors, they are also by far the most arrogant of Trolls.

Some even refusing to speak any language other than there own,

being unwilling to degrade themselves so much. Many Troll Shadow

Knights use magery in battle to weaken and cripple their

opponents before the first blow has been thrown. Troll Shadow

Knights enjoy the suffering of others, and are not above torture.

In fact, they're quite good at it.</font>

<br>
</a>The world is a strange and magical place for a primitive race

of people, but the Troll Shaman has the answer to all its

mysteries. Troll Shaman are con men with magical powers,

unfortunately they believe there own con. They seek to explain

the forces of nature through their gruesome rituals. Shaman make

other Trolls uneasy, which is exactly how they want it.</font>

spitting into a bowl of bile, studying the directions that bodies

fall on the battle field, casting bones on the ground,

contemplating their naval, looking at the stars, dreaming...

There are hundreds of ways to see the future, and the Shaman

knows them all.</font> </p>



<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">As if that weren't enough every Troll Shaman has a spirit

helper, this spirit helps guide the Shaman into understanding his

visions. Most spirits helpers are either animals or Trolls long

since dead. Shaman will often times speak to their helper as

plainly as they would to anyone. Their helper can tell them many

things and will often times be a great source of inspiration to a

Shaman.</font> </p>



<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">When a truly grand vision is necessary a Troll Shaman will mix

a powerful drink known as &quot;Grol&quot;, it is made from

various mushrooms and berries that are found within the swamp.

After drinking it, if the Shaman survives he will often times

have the truly amazing vision he was searching for, but will also

have lost a little bit of his sanity as well... Perhaps forever. <br>
