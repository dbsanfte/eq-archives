        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Back to a more traditional story telling method :)</P><P>Chapter I: In a Predicament</P><P>It is rumored among the most intelligent races of Norrath that first came the dragons.  The great crystalline Dragon, ruler over the plane of sky, departed life onto a lifeless planet and with one swipe of her mighty claws laid claim to the promise of a new world.  Norrath quickly developed from infancy as brave explorers journeyed forth in search of fertile lands on which to rule.  Villages became towns, towns became cities, cities became kingdoms.  Guilds and alliances formed, bound together through common goals and the sharing of ideas.  The desires to grow beyond the common abilities of mere mortals introduced powerful skills, trades, and crafts.  Wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters mastered powerful magics and mystical arts.  But alas, ignorance often led to folly.  The Combine Empire spread and died.  The Erudites warred with magic and rent asunder a peaceful land.  Dark Elves and the tales of their merciless cruelty brought many a village to ruins.  A mighty mage of all four great Arts lost himself in the quest for immortality.  Time passes, history is written and forgotten, beings born and died, the cycle of seasons turn, and the dance with shadows continue.</P><P><BR>"Heretics, offspring of the ancient war that had wrecked the continent of Odus and created the Hole, practitioners of the dark, forbidden arts of Necromancy, and servants of the Faceless lord of fear Cazic Thule." Weligon Steelherder looked across the marble floor where stood the newest initiates of the Deepwater Knights.  "As Knights of Prexus the Oceanlord and allies to the High Council of Erudin, it is OUR duty to drive these defilers of the ocean to where they belong... In the Hole with the rest of the earth-dwelling filth."</P><P>"For Prexus!" The initiates pledged.</P><P>Weligon smiled to himself.  With the recent buzz of rumors of a Heretic attack on Erudin, initiates to the Order had increased nearly tenfold.  Eager younglings with their eyes set on glory came by the troves to the Temple of Deepwater.  For unlike the Quellious Peacekeepers, the Knights of Deepwater were not reluctant to fight... And to die, but that was something Weligon preferred not to think about.  As long as the will of Prexus was upheld, the Oceanlord can take lives as he saw fit.</P><P>"Dismissed! Remember what I have taught you today.  If you ever meet a Heretic, let your sword do the talking." The initiates bowed and left the main hall.  Weligon stood in silent satisfaction for a while, and then turned to head into his quarters.  But a presence in the room caught his attention.</P><P>"Lord Weligon." A strange voice remarked stolidly.</P><P>"Who is it? I am quite a busy man, myself." Probably some new initiate, Weligon mused.  He can come back tomorrow.</P><P>But the man that strode forth was no robe-wearing initiate.  Clad from head to toe in the customary black and white plate mail of Erudite paladins, the newcomer was marked by a sign of experience that no initiate could ever have.  With no visible brows and hairless, the man at first seemed to be old.  But then Weligon noticed the hawk eyes beneath the faceguard of a full helm and the youthful vitality that danced within them.  For a moment Weligon himself was perplexed, but then he remembered a word that he had heard only recently.</P><P>"Dragosan." The younger paladin nodded, lifting the faceguard and staring Weligon straight in the eyes.  "Why have you returned? Have you done what I asked of you?"</P><P>Without a word, Dragosan drew forth a sack and threw it at Weligon's feet.  The Deepwater guildmaster bent and picked it up dubiously, not taking his eyes off of the increasingly bitter stare of the young paladin, and opened the sack.  Within was a single piece of paper, on which was etched the designs of a plan to build a bridge between Antonica and Odus.  "So I see you have obtained the plans.  Now, what about the heads of the three engineers that I told you about?"</P><P>Dragosan spat, and suddenly his long sword was out of its sheath, pointed straight at the Deepwater guildmaster.  "You have deceived me.  These three that the plans speak of are not in anyways affiliated with Evil.  Indeed, I have discovered that they are worthy, respected man who stands AGAINST evil the same way we do! How dare you order me to slay them, under the eyes of Prexus?"</P><P>Weligon looked amusingly at the young paladin and his sword.  He laughed.  "Are you so naive, Drago, to think that the only enemies of Erudin are those who so conveniently list themselves as servants of the darkness? These three engineers that the list speaks of are as good enemies to Erudin as the kobolds or poachers that you have fought in the past, or the Heretics!"</P><P>Dragosan's eyes blazed with wrath, and the sword in his grasp inched toward Weligon’s heart.  "How can you compare righteous men with kobolds and poachers, or the accursed Heretics? It is you who is naive, Weligon, to think that I will commit this murderous atrocity for you!"</P><P>"Murderous atrocity!?" Weligon threw up his hands in exasperation, but his eyes never left the sword pointed at his heart.  "Do you know what would happen if that bridge was built? We Erudites have long lived in solitude and peace because of our isolation from the savages that dwell in Antonica.  That bridge being built is alike to the establishment of a gateway to the Faceless's Realm! We would never have peace from the barbaric humans and their conquering armies!"</P><P>"You lie!"</P><P>"Do I? Why do you think Great Erud brought our people over the seas? Why do you think Erudin prospers so, even as the savage cities of Queynos and Freeport festers and decays? Why do you think that our magic is the supreme of all the people of all the lands? Because we are free from their savage ways and their savage wars!" Weligon beamed in triumph, sensing a wavering in the younger paladin.</P><P>"That... That is a lie! I have been to Queynos, and to Freeport.  The men there are righteous and trustworthy, unlike the likes of you!"</P><P>A small secret, brought back by Erudite spies, that Weligon had had the pleasure of hearing now gave him a great advantage. "Truly? You believe that the savages of Queynos and Freeport are righteous? Well, let me tell you a little secret, Dragosan.  The men who calls themselves the Freeport Militia are no more than street thugs in the service of an evil shadow knight and his comrades in Neriak!"</P><P>"You... You lie!" Yet even as his mouth formed these words, Dragosan's heart was filled with doubt.  "That's impossible... And, and irrelevant.  I, I will not believe a false man like you, one who would call for the murder of three innocent men.  And, and you call yourself a knight..." Deep in thought, Dragosan lowered his sword.</P><P>"But I am a Knight! Greater than you’ll ever be, foolish boy!" Sensing the sudden opening, Weligon drew his two-handed Deep Six cutlass and swung it in a deadly arc right for the younger paladin's neck.</P><P>Instinct won over logic, and Dragosan dodged the swing just barely.  Bringing his own sword to bear, he parried the next blow, and stood face to face against the older veteran.  "Greater, because I'll be alive, whereas you'll be dead." Weligon smiled, and the two paladins clashed.  Fiercely they fought, the sound of steel upon steel ringing from each and every blow.  For a moment the two were equally matched, but then Weligon's greater experience coupled with his foe's doubt gave him the second wind.  Soon, Dragosan was hard pressed to keep up with the Deepwater guildmaster's deadly assault.  </P><P>But the younger paladin was far more troubled with his own thoughts than with the mortal death that he faced.  The startling revelation Weligon gave him, if true, was a testament of his own error.  If he was wrong, and Weligon was right, then he was not only a disobeyer, but also a traitor to the paladins of Erudin.  This he could not bear, not when his entire life Dragosan had been trying to do what was right and just.  His thoughts racing, and the clock of his life ticking away, it would've taken a miracle indeed for Dragosan to escape the predicament.</P><P>And at that moment, a miracle happened.  A young initiate walked into the room.  "Lord Weligon, I forgot to ask-" Using that one instant of respite to realign himself, Dragosan pushed through the door the initiate opened and closed it behind of him.  Rushing down the marble hall of the Temple of Deepwater, he could hear Weligon's bellow and a flurry of feet behind of him.  But at that moment, Dragosan had but one conscious thought and that was to flee, to find somewhere safe, where he could think.</P><P><BR>The winds of Odus passed gently over Erud's Passing, sending waves rippling through the peaceful sea.  Seagulls roamed freely in the sky, occasionally diving down to fetch food from the waters.  A lone figure stood atop a stretch of rock, face hidden by a dark brown hood.  His unseen eyes were set toward the endless bounds of the sea before him, and they were silent.  Bending, he drew from the folds of his robe a small white seashell and let it fall into the clear blue waters.  Then, drawing close his robes, he left.</P><P><BR>Dragosan stumbled and fell, somewhat grateful that it was grass and not sharp sticks that broke his fall.  He had run until he could no longer hear the shouts of his pursuers.  It had been day when he entered the Temple of Deepwater.  Now the sun, though he could not see it beneath the foggy canopy above him, was surely setting if not set already.  It was dark all around him; the silence of the night interrupted only slightly by the myriad of noises in the forest.  Some made by insects, others by creatures better left to the imagination.</P><P>Nearly blind in the darkness, Dragosan stayed where he fell.  He would've been content to just embrace the silence, but a glimpse of lantern light caught the corner of his eyes.  Half crawling and half limping, Dragosan made toward the light.</P><P>But the eyes could be deceiving at times, and it was no lantern that Dragosan found.  Instead, he found a six-legged beetle crawling above a small log.  Its eyes emitted a flame not unlike that of lanterns, flickering and altogether eerie.  It was a fire beetle, one native to the Toxxulia Forest that Dragosan now limped through.  Without thinking, Dragosan grabbed the fire beetle and made a lantern out of it.</P><P>Content that now he had a little light, Dragosan found the stump of a tree and crawled onto it.  His feet burned, evidence of the hectic day, and his mind was more tangled than the thickest undergrowth.  Dragosan ran away to think, but now that he could he realized that he feared to think.  Having been a paladin for the better part of his life, Dragosan was no stranger to fear, but he had never been fearful of thought.  It was an odd predicament, to be sure.</P><P>The hours that followed passed like eternities.  Fearing to think and too tired to walk, Dragosan stared into the hollow darkness with only the fire beetle cradled in his arms as light.  He fancied how pathetic he must look, but the thought disappeared quickly like most of his other thoughts.  He dared not think.  Some times later, he thought he saw a small wisp of light pass in front of him, followed by a playful pixie.  Memories of the childhood tales flared into life, but they were gone as quickly as the willowisp and the pixie, who seemed to giggle at him before she left.  The surrealism of the scene made Dragosan question his sanity and he fell into a deep, troubled sleep.</P><P>It was still night when he woke, stirred awake by a clicking noise about him.  The fire beetle he had cradled was gone, replaced by the nearly tangible shadows fleeting back and forth in the darkness.  Dragosan looked around, but could see nothing but shadows.  An eerie silence surrounded him, an emptiness where even the noises of the creatures of the forest were gone.  But the clicking noise came again, this time nearer.</P><P>Grabbing the hilt of his sword, Dragosan tensed.  He noticed that he had fallen off the stump in his sleep, and now lay crumbled on the ground.  It was not a very defensible or advantageous position, his instinctive mind told him, but it was too late to do anything about it.  The clicking noise came again, this time nearly next to him.</P><P>Letting fly a prayer to Quellious the Tranquil, Dragosan twirled his fingers in the air, drawing forth a sudden influx of light that exploded in a flash.  Using the moment of confusion to pinpoint the shadow of his foe and as an element of surprise, Dragosan brought his sword down in a blow meant to disable, if not cripple.  It was then, however, that he felt the numb pain in his left foot and was caught off balance, only nicking his assailant.</P><P>The counterattack nearly knocked him out cold.  It was as if a stone hit him on the head.  The enemy was surely wearing brass knuckles or using a hammer, Dragosan thought, as he swung his sword in the direction where the blow came from.  This time it connected solidly, and a crunch was heard.  </P><P>Thinking it odd that a sword would make a crunching sound on the contact of flesh, Dragosan tried to retract his sword hand, but his blade was held fast in whatever body it had sliced into.  Unusually lightheaded, Dragosan pulled at it two more times before he was knocked back by a kick that almost made a dent on his armor.  Sword no longer in hand, Dragosan wrestled a root from the ground and swung it like a club at the shadows in front of him, shouting the name of Quellious out loud like a madman.  But he did not connect any of his dozens of swings.  Exhausted, Dragosan noticed that about him all was silent.</P><P>A cold, dim light flashed into being.  Dragosan almost mistook it for another willowisp but for the hand that held it in front of him.  A robed head appeared from beneath the darkness, illuminated by the light.  It was a youthful face, with the angular head and dark skin typical of Erudites, but the eyes were tinted a slight red in addition to its usual black.  </P><P>The two Erudites looked at each other for a time, and then Dragosan noticed that the robed figure did not seem injured at all.  Whatever it was he hit, this man was not it.<BR>	<BR>"So what have we here? A paladin of Quellious, I take it?" The voice that came bore a somewhat mocking tone to it.<BR>	<BR>"Indeed." Dragosan managed to answer.  "And who are you?"<BR>	<BR>"A thoughtful traveler." The robed youth stretched out his hand.  "Can you stand?"<BR>	<BR>Dragosan took the youth's hand and tried to stand.  But once again he felt the numb, excruciating pain in his left feet and fell to the ground.  "Damn, it must be broken."<BR>	<BR>The youth snickered.  "So how is it a paladin of Quellious finds himself this late in the forest? Your crotch calls?"<BR>	<BR>Normally, Dragosan would have challenged a man for such a rude comment.  But with so much on his mind, the paladin only shrugged.  <BR>	<BR>"No offense intended.  I am merely curious." The robed youth bent and clutched Dragosan's left ankle in his free hand.  The pain was simply numbing, and Dragosan could not but scream.  "It does seem broken.  Perhaps I can shout for a cleric or paladin of some sort? Surely they would help their ilk."<BR>	<BR>"No!" Dragosan answered before thinking, and then added.  "I mean, do not."<BR>	<BR>"Hmm? Why not?"<BR>	<BR>Dragosan did not want to reveal his fight with Weligon Steelherder, especially not to a stranger.  But the laws of Quellious demanded the truth from her followers.  "I am in... Slight disagreement with my fellow paladins."<BR>	<BR>"Oh!" The youth seemed joyful.  "So you are an outcast.  How wonderful!"<BR>	<BR>"I am NOT an outcast!" Dragosan snapped.<BR>	<BR>"Let's see.  You hide in the forest, but isn't lost.  You sleep with the trees, but isn't an elf.  You are hurt, but don't want the help of clerics or paladins.  You are a paladin of Quellious, but also in slight disagreement with them.  Sounds like an outcast to me!" The youth stood, and a slight grin formed upon his bony face.  "It just so happens that I know someone who can help you.  But he too is an outcast.  So, you can either accept my help, or you can lie here and wait till someone or something finds you.  What will it be, noble paladin?"<BR>	<BR>Considering his alternatives, Dragosan saw no other path.  If the Deepwater Knights discovered him, they would surely slay him.  Weligon had probably already marked him a traitor to the High Council.  They would be hunting for him.  At that point, the only way would be to confront Weligon before the High Council, and Dragosan somehow doubted that the High Council would side with a minor paladin of Quellious instead of the guildmaster of the Deepwater Knights.  It all seemed so murky and demented that it was hard to imagine that he would be involved in it.  It all seemed like a treacherous story some bard would tell.  It all seemed like a nightmare.<BR>	<BR>"I will see this outcast of yours." And may Quellious forgive me, Dragosan said to himself, for having to go this stray way.</P><P>"Great! I will take you to him at once." The youth turned to go, taking the light with him.  <BR>	<BR>"Wait! I can't walk!" Dragosan's words were caught off suddenly as two great arms lifted him from behind and then held him aloft like a child in its arms.  It was surely a very strong man that could perform such a feat, Dragosan thought, feeling nothing but the force of the arms upon his armor.  But as they walked, Dragosan felt more and more uncomfortable - especially of the clicking sound his bearer was making, and the fact that his bearer did not speak or even breath.<BR>	<BR>It just so happened that when the trio - the robed youth, Dragosan, and his bearer -reached the Toxxulian river a wicked flash of moonlight caught them straight across the face.  It was at this moment that Dragosan, turning, beheld the face of his bearer.  He was perplexed, at first, and then a dread began to beat in the depth of his mind.  For what held him like a child had not the face of a man, but rather what remained of the face of man after all the flesh had fallen off.</P><P>"Oh, and before I forget." The robed youth stated rather blandly.
