        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">ive personally done these quests many time, i have an 8th ring on my monk, and done about 4-5 7th rings for myself and others<BR>might as well post my info from a 50+ necro perspective if any of you are drugding through these</P><P>now, i started them at about lvl 45 or so, and had help(druid of the same lvl), but im able to do all of them(1-7) solo now, not so much becuase of my lvl, but of the tricks ive developed</P><P>now, theres 3 distinct parts<BR>rings 1 and 3 are abot collecting crap(and if your not into trade skills, getting them up, or getting a friend that has decent smithing/tailoring)<BR>1st ring = 2 HQ cougar+ 2HQ kodiak skins from EW, trivial at 80 or so, probably lower, i was at that when i started, never failed<BR>3rd = HQ walrus skin, rhino horn, skinning stone, similar trivial, final product is NOT nodrop or lore, so get a friend to make you one(stone is no drop, but easy enough to get)</P><P>2nd and 4th rings are on aobut 90min timers(the npcs involved), <BR>2nd is boridain , and is imo, the biggest pain in the ass,ohter than camping glora to this quest<BR>all the variables involved, but ive soloed this, and it isnt that hard, but it can easily end 5sec after you start<BR>first thing, go get your axe from garadain, and start /oocing to the zone so no one ganks your spawn, next, make a good pet, buff, med, head to the giant fort, wait for the captain to come out, as soon as he starts walking back in, pull and kill those giants , then head back to boridain<BR>now, this part is critical, before handing him the axe, look around, look good, lots of orcs, dervs, giants path right by him, and ive had him die RIGHT away from crap pathing into him as soon as i spawn the thurg aligned version<BR>spells you will need : fear, ST, dark, ebolt<BR> <BR>start following him, if your undre lvl 49, get help, or youll probably fail, with the buffed 49pet you can send that against anythign in the way before he gets to it if needed</P><P>ive found that even if something aggros him, you sent your pet on the mob, and it will focus on your pet<BR>best strategy is, howver, to fear mob, back pet off, mez boridian, and check for aggro clearing on him<BR>after a bit, he will stop for his snack(if your unfamiliar with this quest, cross reference another guide for specific locs, messages etc..., this post is more or less an adendum for a soloing necro)<BR>at this point, run to the jail, theres the stable with a giant and an orc, pull giant, ebolt, pet, fear, whie that ones dying, pull orc with dark and ebolt, by the time the giant is dead the orc will be too, its best to kill these fast, becuase poor ole boridain is all alone<BR>now, while doing the quest, i suggest you /ooc a few times, as one time i had a lame drood come up, snare and start blasting boridain to 'findout what axe he had', i had to end up dispelling him and heading onward</P><P>mez/fear are the biggest friends in this, as most things you fear in EW, will not come back, and you can mez him to buy oyu some time, make sure that oyu check for clear aggro, and dont hesitate clicking your CoS if he actually hits you, he has NO hp an your pet will kill him QUICK</P><P>back to the guide, by the time your done killing the jail stuff, boridain would have stood back up and started heading towards you, this part is relatively safe<BR>ive never seen him aggro a walrus or ulthork, but keep your eye open<BR>he starts heading towards orc fort, and stops for a nap, med break time<BR>now sometimes pathing will put a mob on him, no biggie, if its an orc/derv just send pet, maybe dark and sit back down, if giant, darkf/fear<BR>now this last stretch is tricky, alot of hills, and alot of pathers here, the orc fort itself is a joke, their usually perma killed(noobs capming the fort)and a joke to klil if their not, then he heads back to his spawn<BR>again, run ahead and make sure nothing is pathing on his hill, alot of trees there, hard to tell<BR>the rabid kodiak, a joke, send pet, i usually ebolt to get it over with quick and take a few hits while my pet beats it backside, loot pelt, hand to him, done<BR>anohter way to do this one is the tag and FD method, much more risky, but much MUCH faster, you have to know his 'tag'points well though, so only try this if youve done it normally 4+ times, it starts the same, wait for captain, kill giants, head back to him, trigger him, let him walk down the hill , now, each time he says a line, this is a 'tag' point, he MUST hit these points, so you can tag him, run to kael and FD there, he will walk back to his next 'tag' point, so know them well, or all your extra time saving work, will be in vain<BR>point here is, tag him, run him(zigzaging past mobs in the way), FD dump him at his next point, stand up, tag, FD dump etc..., at the snack, go kill jail mobs<BR>again, risky, but real fast(about 5min, as apposed to 15-30min)</P><P>4th ring , unless oyu come wiht a full group you will need 2 4th npc spawns, 1 to kill giant, 1 to hand the item to the npc<BR>now this one i reccomend help (a druid is usuall the way to go, unless you hvae someone 56+ to signel pull him)<BR>walk up to tain(or is it tanik?), hail him, and when your ready say 'i will help, then run south a bit, the giants will come from the bride(east) and bum rush him, you only have a few seconds to target the named one as they despawn if not aggroed after the npc is dead<BR>now, if your solo, make sure yo uhave a damage sponge up, strategy is to fear off all the non named till oyu have the named left, pull towards bridge area, root/dot, about 10k hp<BR>i HIGHLY recomend having a druid wiht you<BR>if you do, have druid snare the named from the getgo, and start kiting the rest away(to dump them on a dorf camp), you(while invis) will wait for her to make a nice distance from named to non named, then shadowvortex the named and BAM, hes chasing you, igniteblood, splurt, plauge (ebolt resits sometime), and be prepared for about 2-3rounds of those<BR>loot elixer, when npc pops again, say i will help, then hand him the elixer, you get back the NOT no drop, NOT lore hammer, <BR>all these giants hit for 150+, run fairly fast, and stun quite often, so unles you have balls of steel, get a durid to help oyu, or if your 56+ stand at max distance and pull with a lvl1 spell</P><P>now, 5th 6th and 7th are all triggered</P><P>for 5th, get yourself some invasion plans<BR>/ooc to the zone , as any noobs will die REAL fast if an oracle takes a liking to them<BR>now this part is critial, took me MANY 5th ring to get this part right and soloable<BR>setup north (and a bit)west from garadains hut<BR>thers some trees here, so your about casting distance from the dorfs , but out of aggro<BR>get a good 49pet up and buffed, med up to full<BR>now this part happens fast, if you screw the begining up, it turns into a circus, that cna end in your death if you get an oracle on you(they run sow speed, dispell, hit like mofos etc...)<BR>what your going to do is stand facing the lookout, so you can see through gloras hut<BR>the orcs will spawn at an angle between the dorf huts and te orc fort, you NEED to intercept scarbrow, or your screwed<BR>he charges the dorfs as soon as he pops, the rest buff then charge the dorfs<BR>/ooc the zone one last time, hand plans, run towards the orcs, aggro scarbrow anyway you can(BEFORE he gets to the dorfs) and run to your pet, DO NOT try to snare him yet, <BR>once you dump him on your pet, snare, fear, nuke, whatever, kinda wuss hp<BR>if oyu get dorfs on you, just blast fast so they dont KS you<BR>if you get oracles on you, FD, and FD fast<BR>youve fucked up, do it again later</P><P>6th ring, you need rodricks head first, if youve EVER been to EW, chances are youve kiled rodrick several times, if not, hang out at the orc fort and wait for a rygorr emmisary to spawn, when he does, he will spawn rodrick at the zoneout from CC, use a 49pet, buffed, and splurt and torbas up, he resists everything else, dont bother tyring to snare, fear , nothing, pullw ith splurt, then just chain torbas, or lifetap, if he procs often, your pet can solo him, if not, it can go either way, so your blasts realyl help out<BR>now, familiarize yourself wiht the orc huts by the bridge, and icefangs hut, and the run in between, you need to do this quickly<BR>when your ready, /ooc the zsone NOT to kill icefang, and head to icefangs hut about 11pm game time, <BR>korrigan will spawn, hail him, and hand him your 5th ring (now steps 6-7 you NEED to have rings prior done before, the rest can be done in any order), he will give it back<BR>icefang will respawn and walk out to get buffed, <BR>target icefang, and run to the orchuts by teh bridge(i reccomend keeping icefang targetted, so you know if someones killed him or not)<BR>when at the orc huts, your going to setup at the waterline(east of the huts), make your pet there<BR>do not buff him, so you can keep icefang targeted<BR>it takes him about 5min to get here, so bear with him<BR>now if your doing this with help, clear out the orcs there before hand, it makes it easier to see the spawned once when they pop<BR>now this part is an art, you will probably hvae to do it several times to get it right, and probably die if the oracles get on you<BR>when the spawns begin you need to inch towards the huts<BR>poxbreath has spawned inside the hut and will buff up(EVEN IF YOUR WITHIN HIS AGGRO RANGE), whic is critical to know, so you dont go to far<BR>perfect pull = poxbreath alone or up to 3total(him and 2more)<BR>bad pulls =  if you dont get cloes enough none come, they charge icefang, casting on poxbreath at this point is a death wish, as ALL the orcs will come and kill you fast<BR>or if you get TOO close, more than 3come and you will probably die<BR>when you get a good pull, what will happen is you will see an oracle start running at you(he was a spawn by the fire) start walking backwards, target him, fear him off<BR>2more will come towars you, poxbreath and anohter oracle, your 49pet has enough hp to live through 3beating on him while you fear off the oracles and snare poxbreath, the feared ones will NOT comebac, unless your pet goes chasing them, so keep your eye out for your pet<BR>once oyu hvae him left, your pet is basically useless since oyu will snare/fear him no matter what<BR>if your pets alive, woot, fight is over quicker<BR>if not, keep him feared(do NOT root), he WILL gate<BR>all the orcs will have despawned by this point, but its possible that they have not, and agian, you WILL die<BR>spells to use, dooming, fear, ebolt, nukes of your choice, poxbreath is a pushover, its just an art getting him solo</P><P>finally, 7th ring, this has 2 pats, getting the key, and the final run<BR>to get the key, you need t kill warden bruke<BR>again, i HIGHLY reccomend having someone to helP(*cough* druid)</P><P>you will setup in the southeast corner of the reccess where the jail is, so that the warden(or his PH) is north of you<BR>make ure oyu have a max, or 2nd to max 49pet up<BR>kill PHs till he pops, xp is ok, 6min pop, you can get him twice in a row, or one night i killed over an hours worth of PHs, so its real random<BR>things to know about the warden<BR>100mr, no snare, no fear, no lifetaps even<BR>WUSS to fire spels, ignite bones you ask?, yes , time to bust out your skell nuke, his FR is THAT low<BR>spells to have up, 49pet spell, pet heal, pact, or shadowbond, ingiteblood, or pyro or your best firedot<BR>pulling him is critial as when you aggro him, theres a few triggered spawns at the front of his hut, there is an opening out the side, pull him through there, its probably not a good idea to cast on him from behind the wall, as he will probably ghost onto and smack you around a good bit, meaning oyu can pact/bond your pet, since you can NOT lifetap him<BR>you will pull iwth your fire dot<BR>now, if your alone, theres 2 strategys<BR>1 is , pretend your a mage, pull iwth a fire dot, <BR>when pet gets to halfway, start casting anothe rpet, RIGHT before its done casting, /pet get lost<BR>repeta till hes dead<BR>and if you have balls of steel(and dont mind waiting for another PH if you fuck it up) is to aggro whore him<BR>/pet taunt off, pull with fire dot, <BR>and then just sit, or ignite bones to keep his aggro on you, <BR>ALWAYS use your 49pet, none of the others(maybe spec) have the HP to take what hes going to dish out<BR>now, if oyu have a druid to help you (either that, or a full balanced group with melee, healers etc...)<BR>buff pet wiht skin, regrowth, DS, have druid pull wiht lvl1 spell(low aggro), once aggro is on pet, you fire dot, now at this point, your job is to alternate mendbones and ignite bones, while te druid chain heals your pet<BR>no matter what he will NOT leave yor pet alone<BR>so kick back and just go through the motions, soon hell be dead, probably 10-15khp<BR>now, oyu have the key<BR>next step, familiarize yourself with corbin (the prisoner at hte jail) and dobbincrossaxes hut<BR>(oh, if you botch the solo warden method, run to the dorfs, FD to clear aggro, the chain nuke and pray you dont get KSed)<BR>once you know the path, get a pet up, kill the giants/orcs gaurding him<BR>all wusses, LONG repop, but dont dillydally<BR>now do yourself a favor, /ooc to make sure on one is kiling dorfs, one time i had to keep corbn mezzed for about 10min while i waited for dobbin to pop, not fun at all<BR>you will hand him the key and your 6th ring(this step IS MQable, )you get your 6th ring back<BR>invis up and follow him, <BR>have a weapon equiped, mez and root up<BR>halfway there he will get ambushed, either have 2-3gorups up for the fihgt, or know your necro<BR>he will say something like 'almost there' <BR>this means the time is soon<BR>then you will get zone spam, commander bharek shouts something to the zone, immediately hit corbin and run north(towards the water), you will have pulled him out of the ambush, once to the water run towards dobbins hut, mez him till you clear aggro, then follow him to dobbin , when he asks for it, hand him your 6th ring, get a note, hand the note to garadain for 7th ring</P><P>8th ring<BR>for this ring, you need preparations<BR>you will NEED 1 lvl60, doesnt matter what class, some sort of melee, and some sort of healer<BR>the way this part works, you need gloridain, shes on a 22-24hour spawn in te hut with the injured warrior, shes usually 'camped' , as someone will want her, and will wait there<BR>onetime, i camped her 1hour, next time, 4hours, ive talked to people whoved camped her 10+ hours, so this may be a long camp, or a short one<BR>before hand, MAKE SURE that you find out her last spawn, so your not waiting countless hours for nohting<BR>now, i reccomend 1 lvl60 melee, and any 50+ healer , druid preferably for the snare<BR>you CAN do this as a solo necro, but the chief needs to die fast as you need to spawn hm, kill him and hand his head in , before garadain is done wiht his peptalk<BR>when she pops, run to garadain and hand him your 7th ring, youll get marching orders, when your ready hand her the orders to spawn teh war<BR>before this, your group will need to be setup inside the orchutwalls, but OUTside the buildings themself, they will be on the west side , up against the wall(the side wher the oracle spawns)<BR>as soon as you hand it in, invis up and run to them ,make a pet if you want<BR>after about 1min, 5mobs will spawn between the entrance to the fort, and the entrance to the building<BR>2giants, with 3orcs in between them<BR>the orcs will be, firebrand, the oracle, and the chief<BR>all of them, drop ALL their loot(firebrand drops ember and guants etc...)<BR>you only need the chief, rather, his head<BR>once they pop, lvl60 targets chief and pulls him towrads you<BR>kill him(he is no harder than the normal version of himself, so if youve killed him, you know what to expect), hits for 160+, about 10k hp<BR>kil him as fast as you can, waste your mana away, it doesnt matter, the quicker you kill him, the better off youll be, <BR>loot his head(and spear if you want), immediatly invis up and run outside, follow garadain, if you did it right , hell still be doing his pep talk, after a bit, he will walk up to the hump just before the orcfort and call CHARGE, immdediatly hand him the head, equp your new 8th ring, click it, and dance like a little girl<BR>if you want, you can onw head back to the pull spot, and pul lthe oracle(for his shield), and firebrand for his ember/gaunts as gravy for yourself, or your group<BR>now, i believe that you can hand him the head at anypoint, but he despawns immmediately after the head is turned in, so if he doesnt call charge, the orcs/giants that spawn there, will still be there, as the dorfs will not have killed them<BR>8th ring is very easy, the glora camp is real boring, and its best to use as few people as possible, as some people will 'zerg' your spawn saying you dont have enough man power there<BR>if they do this, be my guest, klil garadain away and kill him, they will have lost their 7th ring, and learned a valuable lesson<BR>now, this ring is critical, if you mess up, you will have LOST YOUR RING<BR>all others (even 9th) you get your ring back wether you succeed or fail<BR>if you DO loot the head, but garadain dies, no worry, make another 7th ring, trigger war, hand in head when charge is called, yur done</P><P>now, ive yet to do any of the 9th ring(well, i have the dagger), so as i do them, ill post what ive learned, <BR>id appreciate any postins on this, as im VERY fearful of the peffin step, for those that dont know, shes been changed(*cough* nerfed about 5times), so i dont knw what to expect, and if you mess her up, back to another tainted ale(look it up, its a pain in the ass)</P><P>*tips for the advanced ring maker</P><P>you do not need to do the rings sequencially(except for last few, but the triggered ones are east/fast)<BR>ALL steps are MQable, even 7-8th, have someone loot head and hand it in<BR>all steps can be done while KOS(not sure about 8th since he walks around, but you can sneak off the quest if your kos)<BR>at any point, you can have anyhwere from 2-4of each step done, even parts that are lore<BR>example, 1st ring is lore, 1string blanket is lore, you can have 1ring and 1 blanket</P><P>2nd ring broken axe is lore, so is 2nd ring, but you can have one of each, <BR>final items for 3rd and 4th are NOT lore OR no drop<BR>so do them, and hand them to friends, the elixer looted from 4th giant isnt magic either, so you can have a rog friend just chase them mob whileyou kite it around till he PP it, then just zone<BR>be curtious, /ooc and /shout before you do a quest, you will thank me, alot of times you can get others killed, but in some steps(*cough* 8th), a noobie snooping around can mess it up for YOU<BR>so keep people posted on what your doing<BR>now, 7th ring final run is different from the rest in that, the spawned mobs do NOT despawn, after they hit the 'ambush' point, they stand around confused for a bit, then walk south, they enter the water there, and come out the north, they will just keep cycling the zone like this till someone kills them<BR>why does this matter?<BR>well, the walk RIGHT into the orc fort, so they WILL kill noobs there, so after you finish, warn the zone of that, and more importantly<BR>if your like me and do all sorts of steps and all points, do NOT try 2nd ring after 7th, no matter how good you feel, too many chances for the giants/orcs(the spawned ones) to walk into boridian, they are not that tough, but they walk together, so if you hit the 'bunch' of them, boridian will die FAST<BR>if you plan on doing these rings alot, of for friends, once oy have a 5th ring, trigger the 6th ring a few times, to loot the note, saves yourself a step later on<BR>how to MQ 6th -7th ring<BR>the MQ for this one happens at the key/ring handin point, the person to recieve the 7th ring needs to have looted the key, you hand in ring, he hands in key, he gets 6th ring back</P><P>k, i think i covered all bases<BR>if you have any questions in game, <BR>look me up on veeshan , kriista</P><P>54necro<BR>35monk<BR>Veeshan</font></td>

        <font color="white" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The 9th ring gives 50HP, 9STA for a total of about 68HP. Not a great deal better then a 65HP ring bought for 500pp. The 10th ring is the goal for necros, 100HP, 10STA and a right click 10HP regeneration effect. That is some sweet.</P><P>I started the ring quests until I read about the 10th Step. It clears out the entire zone of GD, kills every NPC in Thurgadin and launches a MASSIVE war between the dorfs and the giants. We are talking 3+ hours of wave after wave of big, nasty giants. I have been present for this end fight, and it takes the combined effort of 40 or 50 uber-type people to pull off. </P><P>The only thing I put out there is that unless you are a member of your server's uber guild, or have a LOT of favors you can call in, chances are pretty slim a necro will see one of these. I think there is a total of 1 of these in my guild (which sits in at about the 4th toughest guild on my server). I would be in a long line behind a lot of melee types getting this ring, as I would assume a lot of necros out there are. </P><P>I only post this to the necros that are excited to get a 10th ring to really weigh whether they will realistically see one. If the answer is no to the 10th ring, the 9th ring is really not worth the effort for a bonehead. </P><P>Cheers,<BR>Ancagalon the Black </P><P></P><P><BR> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
