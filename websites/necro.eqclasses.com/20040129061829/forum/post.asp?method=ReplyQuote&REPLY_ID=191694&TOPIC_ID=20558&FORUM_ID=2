You have no idea why that person purchased the account.
Maybe because they are someone who doesn't have the time in real life to play everquest, but wants to experience the high end of the game?

[/quote]


By him experiencing the high-end game, he is RUINING other's high-end game.  He has never played EQ, PERIOD, if he did not realize the druid had SoW.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And Usul, I respect you,.....why.....because you have earned your position on these boards....hell, I respect every person lvl 40+ for wasting so much of their life.

But, when they go and spend cash, it  doesnt deserve respect(well, unless your gonna marry them for the money).  Its just like breaking the law....he broke a rule, by purchasing the account over ebay.  There are punishments for breaking the rules......There are punishments for lacking common sense.  That fellah did not know one thing about the game(if he didnt know about sow, nor the fact that ebaying will get you banned), I am glad the system has been rid of him.......


Think of it this way....its just like the Darwinian Award....

Don't understand what the hell I'm talking about...well read on.  [:-clue]<br /><br />The other night, I was bored out of my skull in PoK and was helping an enchanter friend earn some plat by twitching him as he casted KEI and other buffs for donation.  Well, 45 mins into the buffing session, a level 55 druid with his epic asked me for SoW.<br /><br />Okay, go figure now.  I have the title "Lich" over my head and I'm carrying my ducky stick to boot; so it's pretty damn obvious that I'm not a Druid.  And even if your deaf, blind, and stupid, I'm a Dark Elf; and that should be a hint and a half for your ass.<br /><br />So I told him that I cannot cast SoW and casually asked him if he was new to the game.  He said that he was and I replied that it was cool.  So then, I asked him if he bought the account like I did (yeah, I'm a lying sack of dogsh*t) and if so, how much.  He told me that he paid $95 USD for it and that he was told not to tell anyone about it.  <br /><br />By now, my evil side fully took control of me and I told him that I can help him by getting SoW for himself.  Basically, I told the poor sap that weapon (his epic) used to cast SoW is currently bugged on certain accounts and that the only way to know is to test it so that it can be fixed.  <br /><br />Anyway, I then told him to test his SoW spell by targeting himself and right clicking his weapon and tell me if a "boot" icon appears on his screen.  Of course, the idiot did and he said nothing happened; the "boot" icon didn't show on his screen.<br /><br />So I told him to file a peition.  I told him to petition the GM telling him that the account he bought was bugged because the SoW is working incorrectly whenever he activated his weapon.  I also told him not to worry about telling the GMs that you bought your account because, after all, they are here to help you.  (yeah, yeah, I'm gonna burn in hell for this.)<br /><br />And after he had petitioned, I sat down with him while shooting the breeze and keeping him company while he filed his petition.  20 mins later, a GM-Admin appeared named Covrok.  (Fast I know, must be a new record.)  And after 5 mins of chatting with the druid, I recieved a tell from the druid that read, "MOTHERF$#%@!ING GM!!!"<br /><br />After that, nothing.  Both the druid and the GM poofed.  [:-owned]<br /><br />Yep, I would consider that a confirmed killed.  My very first kill notch on my ducky stick and I'm hoping for more in the near future.  Don't you just love E-Bayers?   [:-grrr]<br /><br /></span></font></td>

Whooopee dooo... Am I supposed to be impressed?  Took your sorry carcass long enough; after all, this thread has only been around for over a month and was reposted in 3 other forums.<br /><br />But now that you're here; I guess that I should clear the air and let the truth of this little drama come out.   Let's just say that I know who you are and I also know who's account that you bought.  But more importantly, I know exactly what it costed you.  Well, let me explain for the rest of the folks are reading on.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">Do you know who this is, shithead?<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br />I know excactly who you are.  You are a juvenile asshole who used to played UO.  You had a character named Tinky on the Pacific Shard and you once belonged to a guild called KoB.  You were the worst bunch of PKers, griefers, and scammers in the shard that used every single game exploit to screw people over for your benefit.  You in particular, ripped a lot of people off and ruined the game for a lot of people.  But most of all,  you were the one who scammed me out of my castle, 850K worth of gold and rare items by using an game exploit that almost costed me my UO account.<br /><br /><blockquote id="quote"><font size="2" face="arial" id="quote">quote:<hr height="1" noshade id="quote">Did you realized what youve costed me?<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br />Yes, I know exactly what it costed you.  $95, your UO and EQ account if remember correctly.  OMG, how do I know?  That's because I had it all arranged.  You see, I heard (through some friends who still plays UO) that you were planning to quit UO and wanted to try EQ.  And since I had a RL friend who was quiting EQ and was going to let his account rot, I persuaded him to let me have it instead.<br /><br />Well, let's just say that to make a long story short, you were given a deal that you wouldn't refuse.  You got a very nice EQ account in exchanged for $95 and your UO account.   And the rest?  Well, that's pretty much history.  Needless to say that your UO account has since been deleted.  And since SoE had banned your EQ account, it looks like you don't have any games to play.  Too bad, too sad.  And oh, as for your $95?  It was donated to a few forum board charities - thanks.<br /><br />You know, I've waited a long time for this moment; to see some asshole like you get what they deserved.  What made this all the sweeter is that you did all the work yourself.  I knew that you couldn't resist any game exploits that you could use to your advantage.  So I've added that as a bit of an incentive to have you contract the GM.  Congrats on your stupidity and enjoy your ban.  To quote Mel Gilson in Lethal Weapon 4, "We screwed ya, and it's beeeeeaaautiful..."<br /> <br />And to the rest of the folks; regardless if you agree or flame me, I really don't care.  I'm not really a vindictive person, but after seeing several of your RL friends and myself get screwed over by this asshole; well, I'm sure you would jump at the opportunity to do some payback if you could.  There is obviously history between me and this asshole.  I don't expect any of you to understand or approve, so I'll leave it at that.   That's why a hardly defended myself when people flamed me for my actions.  And to be truthful, I really don't care because none of you know the history that was involved.<br /><br /></span></font></td>

Do you know who this is, shithead? Im sure that you do. And I also know that all this bullshit that youve posted is a total lie!!! Thats right, Gomphe is a lying motherfucking shit.<br /><br />This is what really happend. Its true that I bought my EQ account, but I am in no way as stupid as Gomphe made this out to be. First of all, Gomphe came to me asking for SOW. So I SOWED him. Then he messaged me asking me why I was using the spell when my epic weapon can cast it. He said that the SOW from the epic weapon was much more better than the spell verson cuz it didnt cost mana. But he said that feature was also bugged and that I should petition a GM to fix it. He also said that once the GM fixes the SOW, he will show me a trick to make SOW better.<br /><br />So Gomphe had me test it out on myself and asked me if I saw a boot icon. I said no, and he told me that I should petition the GM to fix it. Then I told him that I didnt know how to do that and that I had bought this account. I also told him that I wasnt suppozed to tell anyone that I bought the account. But since he was cool for helping me, I thought that he wouldnt care if I did. Then Gomphe said that it was okay and that it was the GMs job to help out.<br /><br />So I petitioned the GM and told them that my epic weapon was bugged and that it wasnt casting SOW. After that, he sat with me and chatted while I waited for the GM to come help me. And when the GM appeared, he asked me what was the problem. So I told him about the bug and how I was new to the game cuz I recently bought the game. Then the fucker said something about rules and banned me.<br /><br />Did you realize what youve cost me? Did you really think that you can fuck me over and get away from it?!? Well FUCK YOU!!!! You arent that hard to find when you got friends that reads the boards. Yep asswipe, friends, something that scumshits like you dont have.<br /><br />So did you get off for fucking me over? Did you cum all over yourself when you knew what happened, fucktard? So why did you do it? I was nothing but cool to you. I didnt do shit to you.<br /><br />Go fuck yourself over some more dickless wonder!! Remember, what comes around goes around. I hope your proud of yourself. Why dont you go fuck your family over too while your at it. And to all those no life assholes cheering him on, fuck you as well. You may think its funny as hell but it only shows that you are all dickless losers with nothing better to do.<hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br />First off, people like you make me sick, Second off your an idiot. Buying accounts is against the rules, when someone breaks the rules, someone needs to alert the "authorties", Gomphe did so, in a creative way, you got caught, and banned, BOO HOO. I wish it wouldve costed you more, you "need to be learned your an idiot" as you would say it. Play the game like the rest of us, if you dont have time to get to the higher levels, this game isnt for you.<br /><br />Its posts like these why we should bring back public executions. Put em on TV I say, live on pay-per-view!<br /><br />PS, ebay lovers, I have a question. You say you would never try to get a person who ebayed banned. Does this mean you dont report people who break the law in real life? Did you know not reporting crimes is a crime in itself? Prepare to feel the wrath of the authoritys one day, fools.</span></font></td>

Do you know who this is, shithead?   Im sure that you do.  And I also know that all this bullshit that youve posted is a total lie!!!   Thats right, Gomphe is a lying motherfucking shit.<br /><br />This is what really happend.  Its true that I bought my EQ account, but I am in no way as stupid as Gomphe made this out to be.  First of all, Gomphe came to me asking for SOW.  So I SOWED him.  Then he messaged me asking me why I was using the spell when my epic weapon can cast it.  He said that the SOW from the epic weapon was much more better than the spell verson cuz it didnt cost mana.  But he said that feature was also bugged and that I should petition a GM to fix it.  He also said that once the GM fixes the SOW, he will show me a trick to make SOW better.<br /><br />So Gomphe had me test it out on myself and asked me if I saw a boot icon.  I said no, and he told me that I should petition the GM to fix it.  Then I told him that I didnt know how to do that and that I had bought this account.  I also told him that I wasnt suppozed to tell anyone that I bought the account.  But since he was cool for helping me, I thought that he wouldnt care if I did.   Then Gomphe said that it was okay and that it was the GMs job to help out.<br /><br />So I petitioned the GM and told them that my epic weapon was bugged and that it wasnt casting SOW.  After that, he sat with me and chatted while I waited for the GM to come help me.  And when the GM appeared, he asked me what was the problem.  So I told him about the bug and how I was new to the game cuz I recently bought the game.  Then the fucker said something about rules and banned me.<br /><br />Did you realize what youve cost me?  Did you really think that you can fuck me over and get away from it?!?  Well FUCK YOU!!!!   You arent that hard to find when you got friends that reads the boards.  Yep asswipe, friends, something that scumshits like you dont have.<br /><br />So did you get off for fucking me over?  Did you cum all over yourself when you knew what happened, fucktard?  So why did you do it?  I was nothing but cool to you.  I didnt do shit to you.<br /><br />Go fuck yourself over some more dickless wonder!!   Remember, what comes around goes around.  I hope your proud of yourself.  Why dont you go fuck your family over too while your at it.  And to all those no life assholes cheering him on, fuck you as well.  You may think its funny as hell but it only shows that you are all dickless losers with nothing better to do.<br /></span></font></td>

Don't understand what the hell I'm talking about...well read on.  [:-clue]<br /><br />The other night, I was bored out of my skull in PoK and was helping an enchanter friend earn some plat by twitching him as he casted KEI and other buffs for donation.  Well, 45 mins into the buffing session, a level 55 druid with his epic asked me for SoW.<br /><br />Okay, go figure now.  I have the title "Lich" over my head and I'm carrying my ducky stick to boot; so it's pretty damn obvious that I'm not a Druid.  And even if your deaf, blind, and stupid, I'm a Dark Elf; and that should be a hint and a half for your ass.<br /><br />So I told him that I cannot cast SoW and casually asked him if he was new to the game.  He said that he was and I replied that it was cool.  So then, I asked him if he bought the account like I did (yeah, I'm a lying sack of dogsh*t) and if so, how much.  He told me that he paid $95 USD for it and that he was told not to tell anyone about it.  <br /><br />By now, my evil side fully took control of me and I told him that I can help him by getting SoW for himself.  Basically, I told the poor sap that weapon (his epic) used to cast SoW is currently bugged on certain accounts and that the only way to know is to test it so that it can be fixed.  <br /><br />Anyway, I then told him to test his SoW spell by targeting himself and right clicking his weapon and tell me if a "boot" icon appears on his screen.  Of course, the idiot did and he said nothing happened; the "boot" icon didn't show on his screen.<br /><br />So I told him to file a peition.  I told him to petition the GM telling him that the account he bought was bugged because the SoW is working incorrectly whenever he activated his weapon.  I also told him not to worry about telling the GMs that you bought your account because, after all, they are here to help you.  (yeah, yeah, I'm gonna burn in hell for this.)<br /><br />And after he had petitioned, I sat down with him while shooting the breeze and keeping him company while he filed his petition.  20 mins later, a GM-Admin appeared named Covrok.  (Fast I know, must be a new record.)  And after 5 mins of chatting with the druid, I recieved a tell from the druid that read, "MOTHERF$#%@!ING GM!!!"<br /><br />After that, nothing.  Both the druid and the GM poofed.  [:-owned]<br /><br />Yep, I would consider that a confirmed killed.  My very first kill notch on my ducky stick and I'm hoping for more in the near future.  Don't you just love E-Bayers?   [:-grrr]<br /><br /><br /><hr height="1" noshade id="quote"></blockquote id="quote"></font id="quote"><br /><br />nice job its confirmed.. your a huge asshole in a video game that no one gives 2 shits and a fuck about after 4 years. <br /><br />I hope your happy.  I also hope that a herd of stupid black men capture you and take turns shitting down your throat.  <br /><br />then you can come here and post how bad shit tastes.  <br /><br />then we all laugh at you and say your stupid, then you can commit suicide and shawn wooley's mom will make a webpage about your EQ addiction. <br /><br />Peoiple think your an asshole. especially druids.</span></font></td>
