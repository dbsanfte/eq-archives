         Saleem, I know the power of a 60 Shaman. See the thing is most shamans have zero clue as to how to PvP. 50% chance that if I meet a shaman he'll start trying to nuke me to death, like he's a goddam wizard or something. In any case, 60 shamans (esp. with torpor) are <i>extremely</i> rare. But you're right, a shaman is right up there in terms ov PvP. Personally, I'd rate a necro 3rd, maybe 2nd with some luck.</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote>No channeling skill is a BITCH!

In other words, that one person has their own strategy and can counter my strategy fairly well.</P><P>Then there's those other 7 people. They believe that fighting people is just like fighting NPC's -- that every person is going to react the same way so there's only one strategy (wtg potus). For me, PvP is very strategic, and my strategies came from experience, that's why they work. But my point stands -- only 1 out of 8 people (approx) are actually a challange, the rest are so damn predictable I lose my interest in PvP.</P><P>Necro on Vallon Zek<BR>There is no cow level.<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

The first one is called Manaskin.  Not quite as good as Rune V, but two can play that game eh?  Secondly, assuming he prepared his buff list properly, throw in a quick siphon strength, and then dot the fuck out of him.  You fill up his #1 buff slot and suddenly he has to dispell his own buffs just to get at your dot.  You can have him re-pyroed/re siphoned in the time it takes annul magic to repop.  If he was smart enough to leave 2 slots empty...no problem, use ShadowVortex too.  Pyro/Pyre+Splurt are more than enough to finish him rune and all.  While he frantically dispells himself, you Touch of Night. End of Enchanter.  Oh and another fun tactic...see how well your chanter buddy knows the game by Harmshielding at the beginning of the fight...if he doesn't recognize the spell effect, first thing he's gonna do in all likelihood is tash you...see if he notices.  INVUL people don't generate a resist message.  GL with those nancyboy nukes without tash, chantaman.</P><P>Same dot strat will put you all over any druid.  Unlike the mighty Shaman, druid heals suck ass.  You can run him oom pretty easy.  Considering a druid is going to hit me about as often/hard as a level1 rat in west freeport...I really don't see why they'd bother to melee.  I like how you assume a druid can insta poof the pet or something...you can dispell your pet just like you can dispell yourself.  You have Arch Lich for mana...druid has PoTG.  If the druid has no brain, dispell any dots out of your first buff slot that he throws on you.  If he magically has a brain, he'll get Winged Death on you sooner or later...best PvP DOT in the game.  That's when you stack Vexing and Bond on him and laugh.</P><P>-Saleem<BR>Warlock of Xegony</P><P>Edited by - Saleem on 06/06/2002  22:41:44<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

Then he'll simply click the effect back off, leaving a nice open slot for Pyrocuror.</P><P>3) Both debuffs have a 1.5 second casting time, with the usual 2.5 recast delay between them.

(Try this next time you fight a newbie druid: don't annul WD, but instead cast Bond of Death and watch your HP bar. Instead of the expected 100-200, you end up losing nearly 500 HP.

With this strategy, an enchanter can land a sieve on you for each deflux you land on him. If you have 3200 mana, that allows you to deflux the enchanter five times (taking his HP/Rune down to around 800 HP) before running out of mana. Clearly, the necro is at a serious disadvantage in this fight -- and this is if the enchanter DOESN'T recast Rune.</P><P>Cerilius D`Nixx<BR>54 Necromancer, VZ<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         Cerilius obviously belongs to those 90% who can't pvp. And enchanter is PATHETIC in PvP, unless he is in the right zone. For now, let's assume this is all taking place in the arena.</P><P>First of all, even assuming that the ench drains the necro oom and that the necro doesn't hurt the enchanter at all throught the whole time (lol yeah good one); assuming this, what's an enchanter going to do next? Melee the necro to death? I got dibs on the necro in that case.</P><P>Second, lets say the enchanter's last buff is rune 5, and he has 2 slots open and has 2 instaclick items. First off, chances are that the enchanter doesn't have cancel magic memorized, instead he has recant. You quickly pop off some debufs, 3 in a row, the enchanter (if using cancel) dispells one but the other two fill up the slots and you can debuff or dot at will then. If he uses recant (much more likely) he will start taking off his own buffs. Remember, while he is doing all that you are free to do whatever you want -- dot some more or get a pet. As to the enchanter poofing the pet, that can take up to 8 minutes.</P><P>So the enchanter tries to cast on the pet, and you know what that gives you? More time. You can cast Pyre on him, and now he will start losing HP very noticebly. While he is trying to mez/root the pet, you keep casting dots, so your last dots are definetly in the last slots. So he has to dispell himself. Chances are he'll click off every buff he can and the chain-recant, right? Well, this all takes time, and that gives you time to dot some more or maybe even dispell the pet, or ToN the enchanter since he has dispelled his rune.</P><P>Notice, throughout this whole time the enchanter didn't have a moment to spare for a mana sieve, let alone refresh bedlam/rune. And you are saying that the enchanter will win.</P><P>Well all I can say is, thanks to people like Cerilius and Potus, people expect the necro to suck. Good thing, it makes it all the more easier for me to win.</P><P>Necro on Vallon Zek<BR>There is no cow level.<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

With 11 seconds to spare after pillaging himself, he will have plenty of time to cast Chaotic Feedback on you to interrupt, perhaps even after a quick Mana Sieve.</P><P>Even if you did manage to get a pet up somehow, the enchanter will simply charm the pet and wait for it to poof. (Not having played an enchanter, I'll assume for the sake of arugment that you can't dispel off your own charm to poof the pet faster.) Like you mentioned, that can take up to 8 minutes. So what? Does the enchanter LOSE because of this? The surprising answer is *no*.

If the enchanter is a skilled player, he'll take advantage of the fact that your pet runs slower than jboots. First, he'll run in a straight line away from you and the pet (during which time you can't land a single spell besides possibly one Deflux), get some distance, root the pet (2 seconds), hit jboots to refresh his spell gems, and charm the pet (6 seconds). (Notice that if you dispelled root, his charm would still hit your pet before it reached him.) During those 8 seconds, you can take 5.5 seconds to cast Pyrocuror and be 2.5 seconds mid-way through your next dot. At this point, the enchanter will begin to cast Recant on himself, and after you land Splurt/Vexing/whatever under Pyrocuror, both dots will *immediately* get dispelled. The enchanter then just clicks his earring and his jboots again, and his buff list looks as good as new. Now the clock is ticking for your charmed pet, you just wasted ~600 mana, and -- if you were lucky -- you managed to do a feeble 80 damage to the enchanter with the first tick of Pyrocuror.</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote>While he is trying to mez/root the pet, you keep casting dots, so your last dots are definetly in the last slots.<hr height=1 noshade id=quote></BLOCKQUOTE id=quote></font id=quote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2 id=quote></P><P>Always be careful when using a word like "definitely". In our case, the necro's pet at this point is ALREADY CHARMED. No additional mezzing/rooting is needed. But ignoring this fact for a moment, you need to realize that given our hypothetical enchanter's buff setup, it would take *at least* 15 seconds to "definitely" get a dot below the enchanter's buff list (jboot-refreshing taken into account), and that's if he's too stupid to pillage himself in the meantime. On the other hand, it only takes 2 seconds to root a pet and 2.5 seconds to mez it. You're distorting time to make it look like the necro would win. It's like saying "Oh, and while the enchanter is rooting the pet you can drop Splurt, Pyro and Vexing all on him at once before he gets ready to cast his next spell."</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote>So he has to dispell himself.

Let me remind you, Angrier, that this is a hypothetical fight between a *perfect* enchanter and a *perfect* necro. Saying "chances are" followed by whatever you want to happen in the fight doesn't cut it in an argument like this.</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote>Notice, throughout this whole time the enchanter didn't have a moment to spare for a mana sieve, let alone refresh bedlam/rune.

The picture you portrayed was that of an average necro fighting a bad enchanter. If it takes 8 minutes for a charmed pet to poof, a good enchanter can stay alive during the ENTIRE 8 MINUTES just by keeping himself dispelled of dots and refreshing his rune after every three defluxes. (With two more instacast items, he could even afford to lose his rune completely before recasting it.) At the end of those 8 minutes, the enchanter will emerge with a buffed pet, a sizeable mana pool, and necro victim running around helpless and waiting to be killed.</P><P><BLOCKQUOTE id=quote><font size=1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" id=quote>quote:<hr height=1 noshade id=quote>Well all I can say is, thanks to people like Cerilius and Potus, people expect the necro to suck.

         Threads like this are pointless.  These two perfect ubergeared level 60s going at it, debuffing each other to fill slots, and waiting for dots so they get full use of their pillage, tucking away every point of mana for a rainy day, blah blah :)</P><P>When I was a level 40 necro in RM, I killed a 54ish druid.  Why?  Because his snares and WD resisted on me, and his snares/roots on my pet resistsed.  Stuff happens, and fights are never these set-piece absurdities you're talking about.</P><P>Obviously everyone on pvp servers who plays a bard or chanter knows about pet-poofing - it's very lame but universal, it even gets done at guild pvp events, bloody waste of bone-chips.</P><P>Anyway, for my two cents, Arch-Lich is conspiciously better than clarity - you need that speed, and there's almost always lots of health coming in from the offense.  If the necro has a nice sow on his pet that could be the end of the story, I know, outside involvement yadayada.  Basically in real life, whichever of these two turkeys got the drop on the other would start winning like crazy - if the nec jumped the chanter, the chanter would probobly not have a good enough rune or a good enough buff order, noone does when they get jumped.  Anyway, so maybe a clever nec leads off with a debuff, but if he's a dope like me he drops a good dot on (pyro, FP, whatever) and chain defluxes.  If chanter is smart he casts gate and the fight is over.  If he is brave and smart maybe he has a good spell lineup, but unless he's got a really nice spell lineup he's taking a couple ticks of the dot, probobly some pet melee eating the hell out of his rune and deflux being cast, so if he stays he'll probobly be dead.  </P><P>If the chanter gets the jump - well, then the necro had better gate, if he can.  Chanter can strip the bejeezus out of his buffs, keep him from getting spells off easily and neutralize any pet that might have been up.  I wouldn't hesitate to SS-Gate, HS-Gate, whatever.  Chanters with the initiative are bad news to low HP people like me.</P><P>Isn't that a little more reasonable?  At least for pvp servers.  Initiative is so important, because the attacked party loses a few beats of timing, doesn't have good spells memmed, doesn't have pet up/buffed, doesn't have the right buffs, in the right order...  And all of that is crucial.  And then there's group pvp, probobly more important than any of this and even less simple to analyze.</P><P>Personally, I'd say this in summation - we Necros have real killing power, and Chanters don't - but chanters can definately kill casters, including unlucky Necros who don't escape when they're in trouble.</P><P>Ulyn Vindix, 53rd, SZ<BR>(Yeah yeah, I'm low.  But I talk to the warlocks, and I've seen enough of these silly "paper battles" to recognize the fallacies.)</P><P> <a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
