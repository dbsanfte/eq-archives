            <font face="Tahoma">I've been playing a Necro in EQ since release
            back in March of 99. In that time I've discovered for myself and
            learned from others, many nuggets of wisdom which have been
            invaluable to me as a Necromancer. Perhaps they will help you as
            well. Read on, and glean what you may:</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Did you summon a pet, and get attacked
            before you could issue him the weapons he needs? Well, he's now too
            busy fighting that mob to accept your trade. This used to irritate
            the heck out of me because I couldn't give him weapons until the
            fight was over. No problem. Just tell him to back off (You have a
            hotkey for this right? Good..) and instantly give him the weapons.
            You have to give him the weapons VERY fast after you have him back
            off, but it's works. You can give him 2 weapons at once, and he will
            duel wield them fine. Even if he goes back to attacking, the trade
            window will stay open.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--You feigned death with 12 HP's and all the
            mobs left, but if you stand up you know they will come rampaging
            back to you with a bloodlust quenched only by your screams of death
            (Wow, that sounds like a necro more than a dar ghoul knight
            *giggle*). No problem. After you successfully FD (Feign Death), just
            use the /q command to go linkdead and don't log back in until your
            character is *completely* logged out of EQ. This should take about 2
            or 3 minutes. Log back in and you will be standing up, but the mobs
            that you successfully FD'd against have now forgotten you. Remember
            to Gate fast, or invis up fast, you are weak. It helps if you try to
            FD in a semi-safe place where there are no stationary or wandering
            mobs. I have no problem doing this usually. If you know you aren't
            going to make it, just go to a safe place and FD + /q.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Did you bind in a spot you thought was
            safe, but now you are coming back in the middle of some KOS mobs?
            Or, did you accidentally train some KOS mobs back to your bind
            point, and are being attacked as soon as you log back in? (Yes,
            embarrassingly enough, I've been stupid enough to do this.) First of
            all, don't panic and try to get away--You'll probably only die many
            more times. Instead, use the wonderful /q command as soon as you
            load back in, while you are being wacked on. This will keep you from
            loading back in again in that spot after you die. Now either wait
            for the KOS mobs to leave before you log in again, or log in as
            another character and petition a GM for help.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Remember, if you plan on fighting in a zone
            for a long time, make sure that you keep re-summoning your pet until
            you get the best possible summon for your pet's level(s). There is a
            HUGE difference between the worst summon, and the best summon. For
            instance, the level 49 pet spell can summon an undead companion NPC
            that can be between level 37 to level 41. The level 37 pet only hits
            for 47(max), and has MUCH less HP's than the level 41 pet which hits
            for 55(max) and has MUCH more HP's. This isn't the only reason to
            have the best summon (Highest level pet). Also, keep in mind what it
            was like when you were level 6 trying to melee a red level 9 mob.
            Remember how much you'd miss in combat compared to when you'd fight
            a blue mob? Well, that was because of the level difference. Level
            difference means EVERYTHING in EQ. It means more than equipment, and
            it means more than skills (In most situations). Get that highest
            level pet and he will be missing your opponent in melee MUCH less
            than the lowest level pet. Plus he will be doing more maximum damage
            over time--Trust me. Even if it takes 20 re-summons to get that pet,
            it's worth it if you will be fighting in the same place for awhile.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Are you trying to get the best pet for your
            level, but they all con blue at your level? You can't figure out
            which summon level you have by just conning the pet, so be creative.
            First of all, it's important that you remember what the max damage
            is for the pet you've summoned. The level 49 pet hits for a max of
            55 for instance. After you summon the pet, have it fight something
            easy that is close by. If you send it to fight a low green, it will
            hit for it's maximum quite often. Take note of what it is hitting
            for and you will be able to judge it's level easily. No mobs around
            to fight right now?--Have a friend that is close to the pet's level
            con it and tell you what level it is. No friends around that are
            close to it's level?--Duel a friend, and take note of what it hits
            for at it's max. This will take some testing because the pet will
            NOT hit for it's normal max vs another player in a duel. I know for
            a fact that the best level 49 pet hits for 33 max in a duel. After
            you see what level the pet is, have it back off, then have your
            friend log out and in so that you will no longer be in duel mode
            (Being in duel mode can cause problems when you are fighting things
            together.).</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Running out of bone chips? No problem (For
            me anyway). I've played on many servers as a necro, and I have never
            had a problem coming up with bone chips. I have *never* camped bone
            chips myself to harvest them. What I'll do is take 30 minutes and
            sit in Nektulos during prime time playing hours (8PM EST is good.)
            auctioning that I'll buy bone chips for 2 or 4 pp per stack of 20.
            The newbies will flock to you to sell their bone chips. I've even
            had low level necros sell me their chips at that price. I stock up
            on a couple hundred bone chips and I'm set for a month. Lets face
            it, after level 20, you should have no problem coming up with 20 or
            30 pp to stack up on bone chips, so don't be greedy : ). If you are
            low level, just go to a zone that has a lot of decaying or regular
            skeletons running around (Nektulos and EC come to mind) and auction
            every 4 minutes or so that you'll buy bone chips. You can usually
            get them for 20 per 1 pp if you are patient.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Use PE(Paralyzing Earth). People give PE a
            bad name, saying it's no better than root. All I can say, is that
            they are SO wrong. I've had PE last consistently for minutes at a
            time. It consistently lasts longer than Root. It may cost 100 mana
            as opposed to 30 mana for root, but it is well worth it IMO. After
            all, you are a necro, you should always have plenty of mana.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Use Dooming or Engulfing Darkness to stop
            running mobs instead of Rooting or Nuking them. There are many
            reasons for this. Some mobs like to run when they get to about 5%
            HP's or so. This is a very bad thing, because they usually alert
            some of their buddies and cause a train. Stopping runners is a MUST.
            Learn to do it, or die. This is where darkness comes in. If a mob is
            &quot;darked&quot;, when it tries to run away it will not be able to
            run at all. Instead it will stand still, not attacking, just letting
            you whack on it with spells or your pet. The problem with root is
            threefold. Number one, unlike Darkness it has a variable duration so
            the mob may break root and start to run again. Secondly, when a mob
            is rooted it will not just stand still when it tries to run (Like it
            does with darkness), it will attack you. Third, root will nullify
            the effects of your darkness spells (Both the DOT effect, and the
            movement speed reduction effect.) so tell those wizards in your
            group to PLEASE stop rooting. Remember, darkness has a pretty high
            resist rate. Just make sure to start trying to Dark a monster when
            it's still at half HP's. I like to start darking a mob when it's at
            75% then re-dark it when it's at 30% or so just to be extra safe.
            Darkness does not cost a lot of mana to cast, and Necros are mana
            machines. Also, don't even bother with Cascading Darkness. It's
            basically a useless spell. It costs WAY too much mana, and is often
            resisted. Dooming Darkness costs much less mana, lasts the same
            amount of time, and I'm has the same (If not very close to the same)
            movement speed reduction factor. If you want the damage that
            Cascading Darkness does, just use another DoT.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Use lich-type spells (HP for mana line) and
            Lifetap DoT spells (Leech, Vampiric Curse, Bond of Death, etc.) in
            conjunction. This is probably your most efficient way of doing
            damage (With the possible exception of Fear Kiting outdoors.). The
            Lifetap DoT spells have decent damage to mana ratios and will heal
            you from your lich type spells. This is a potent combination. You
            can't beat it's efficiency. Throw in a manastone (If you are lucky
            enough to have one.) and you have some INSANE efficiency. How does
            330 almost unresistable damage for around 90 mana sound?</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Invest in HP items after you have 200 INT.
            HP items are so nice for a necro to have. Remember, for a necro
            HP=Mana=Damage. They are all interchangeable for a necro when you
            factor in the Lich line of spells, Lifetap DoTs, and maximum HP's.
            Consider your HP's mana, because they basically are. A good way to
            invest in your HP's is to ditch your INT rings and pick up some
            Adamantite bands (75 HP's each and -10 vs magic) for 150 extra HP's.
            Also, some jewel-crafted Platinum Fire Opal rings that give 55 Hps
            each work well if you don't like the negative magic resist factor of
            the Adamantites. Is there a cleric around? Beg or pay him/her for
            some HP buffs : )</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Learn to use ST (Screaming Terror) and root
            (Or Paralyzing Earth if you have it). If you ever end up with 3 or 4
            mobs, you will need to learn how to neutralize them, taking some of
            them out of the fight while you dispose of the others. Necros make
            decent enchanters if they are well-played. I have solo'ed up to 4 or
            5 Dar Ghoul Knights after a bad pull (Yes you can pull as a necro if
            you have good pet control.) by making judicious use of ST and root.
            ST one mob and have your pet back off immediately so that he only
            attacks the other mobs and doesn't force the mob you casted on to
            break ST. Remember, you can root a mob while it is ST'd and it will
            not cause it to break ST. Keep as many mobs from fighting as you
            can. Keep them contained while you concentrate on one mob at a time.
            Take out casters or healers first. If there are no casters or
            healers, take out the weakest melee mob next (Since it will drop the
            fastest) then take out the stronger ones. This is what works best
            for me.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Your pet can't taunt that mob off of you
            because you applied too many DoT's too quickly? No problem. Just FD
            (Feign Death) for a bit while your pet builds up some hate on their
            aggro list. After they are good and pissed at your pet, stand up and
            continue to help. Remember, you can only FD for 2 minutes before
            your pet will suicide.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Learn to use the Pact of Shadow (Transfers
            your HP's to target) line on your pet. Keep your pet healed with
            your HP's, and lifetap your opponent to gain back your lost
            life--Aren't Necros great?! : )</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--At lower levels, don't camp items, and
            don't spend much time focusing on your equipment. All you need to do
            is level. Levels are key in EQ. That 8 hours you spent camping the
            Black Tome w/ Silver Runes with a group in Najena yielding no EXP
            and a few deaths would have been MUCH better spent leveling up
            somewhere else. Remember, when you become higher in levels, you can
            camp whatever items you need very easily, and platinum will be much
            easier to obtain so that you can buy those items you want. Stop
            wasting time chasing after low level INT items. If you see them
            auctioned for a good price, and you have the money, then go ahead
            and buy it. Otherwise, just keep going for EXP. Trust me, it's a
            much better use of your time. I had to learn this the hard way with
            my first level 50 Necromanacer.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Need weapons for your pet? Well, now that
            they have nerfed the delay factor of weapons for pets, you can use
            any pair of 1H weapons to get your pet into duel-wield mode. Damage
            and delay means nothing. Now just focus on cost and weight of
            weapons. I still use daggers because they are light and fairly
            inexpensive. If you go to an area where fishing poles and bait is
            sold, and where people fish a lot, you can often pick up A LOT of
            rusty daggers from that vendor. People get rusty daggers from
            fishing, then sell them to a vendor. They are cheap and light. If
            you can't find any rusty daggers, many inns sell regular daggers for
            around 2 plat. If I'm going to be fighting a lot of high level mobs
            in the same zone for a long time, I like to use a Gnoll Hide Lariat
            for my pet. It procs a stun and goes off pretty often in a pet's
            hand. They cost around 25 pp each and can be bought easily from
            players in South Karana. I like to stock up on them whenever I'm in
            that area.</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Use Harmshield offensively. If your pet is
            taking a beating, and you need a little extra edge to finish off
            that tough mob, try this--Cast Harmshield, and sit at the mob's
            feet. Aggro'ed mobs *HATE* it when you sit down. It will normally
            stop focusing on your pet and attack you for the duration of the
            Harmshield. Harmshield often just sits there refreshed for hours at
            a time--You might as well make good use of it. This is a strategy
            that few necros know about. Even fewer know how well it works. This
            strategy goes well with the next tip...</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">--Tank for your pet. Even at level 50, I have
            been in rare situations where I had to tank for my pet. Sometimes it
            becomes obvious that your pet is not going to live much longer no
            matter how many times you pact/heal it. The mob is at 20% and you
            only need a little more time. If you have a lot of HP's, get in
            there an take some hits for your pet like you did back when you were
            level 3 : ). It works. It also helps when the cleric is trying to
            pull of a CH(Complete Heal) on your pet, but the pet is about to
