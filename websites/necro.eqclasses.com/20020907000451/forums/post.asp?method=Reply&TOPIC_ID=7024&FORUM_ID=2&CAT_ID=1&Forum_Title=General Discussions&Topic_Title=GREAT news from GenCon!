Absolutely!!!</P><P>He said the only reason it is not done at this point is he needs 4 or so days to go in and fix the dot code apparently. He admitted that it is NOT good code and apparently needs some stuff fixed. Like he said, he really doesn't want to start introducing *new* stacking problems. :)</P><P>So of course, the next question was when? I expected a typical PR answer of "well, it's something we're looking into...". Not here. He said that it really *had* to go in before PoP was released. So we're looking at 2.5 months as a maximum. I personally think we'll see it soon, possibly within the next couple of patches (Scott did *not* say this, just my opinion based on our conversation).</P><P>I also asked him about Extended Affliction not working consistently. First off, he made it clear that this is a *variable* effect, so sometimes you might get one extra tick, sometimes a couple. He also said that it had some problems with increasing DOT spells like splurt, but it kind of sounded to me like there wasn't much that could be easily done to fix this. Long story short - EA is working as intended.</P><P>On a side note, Scott is a *great* guy to talk to, and laughed pretty hard when I told him the necro community really appreciated him stopping by now and again. He said he is trying hard and will continue to do so. The guy is just, well, AWESOME!!!! :)</P><P>I've never been so excited about my necro's future, and cannot *wait* to see what's in store.

Even if DoT stacking goes in, do you still think that will balance us? We will still have no purpose in short fights, (you can try to argue that one all you want, but in the end it comes down to the *fact* that our fastest DoT is like 48 seconds and there's lots of occasions where a mob will go down in 30 seconds or less.) We will *still* have a dot that only does a slight bit more damage than the most powerful nuke in game, I'm sorry but when a nuke can do 2k+ dmg then to be balanced a dot should do 3k or 4k, the only reason DoTs were ever worth shit was because they did more dmg for less mana than a nuke, just over a longer period of time. Now that wizards can get insane mana regen with their improved familiars, FT items, aa regen, and then have it all stack with KEI they can nuke just about as much as they want worrying only about getting aggro, and if things get tight they can probably grab a mod rod.</P><P>I won't consider us balanced until I see melees getting the message 'Your target has resisted your attack'.</P><P>Until then it will be the same ole VI loves melees more than casters and ultimately when any type of confrontation between the two arises, it *will* go the way of the melees.</P><P>Let's not forget just how much a few pieces of gear can multiply a melee's power. For a necromancer, even a necromancer with 3k hit points and ft15 they still aren't in a whole other ball park like a well equipped melee is over a badly equipped melee.</P><P>I hope you guys realize the truth about EQ if DoT stacking goes in, and you will see that we are no more desired than before. It's still going to be the holy trinity of classes that are most desired, nothings going to change just because the third necro can do more damage now.</P><P> </font></td>

I can imagine how it looked from the outside, whilest all flipping 'em off and telling them to go play the class themselves if they thought it was so cool.  Perhaps the wizards are in the same boat now.</P><P>It would be great to nail something in 30 seconds or less, but the class most of us here play was never intended for that.  From day one the Necro has been intended for very long fights, but the past-team's way-warped view of "balance" never allowed it.</P><P>Scott does seem to be quite a breath of fresh air, and I appreciate his time -- both in coming to these boards and spent delving into the code.  The folks here are right.  Scott is doing a vastly better job than any PR employee of varant has EVER done.  His post coming here to /ask/ us (and other classes' boards) about changes they were implimenting warented a "hell yeah" from me, I don't know about you all.</P><P>My guess is pretty much "option B" as previously stated. Those fabled long-fights will finally be coming into play, and the ability to DoT-stack (which would gain low aggro) will probably be a key to those long fights.</P><P>This is, of course assuming that it's ever done.  There seems to be conflicting reports: One stating that it's too difficult and will probably not be done, and this thread saying "Sure!".</P><P>Necros will never be like those other classes, because Necros are Necros.

This comming from someone who won't be completely satisified until the pet weapon delay nerf is returned to how it once was.  Let the man do his job.  He said he will fix it and I believe he will.  Still though, wizzy nukes = high aggro, necro dots = low aggro.  Meaning you can get the same ammount of damage comparable to a same level wizzy out of a necro with less aggro off the MT.  When one dot is on, we cast a different one.  Smae with all necros on the raid.  Tell me again why this won't make us more desirable?</P><P>And to one other point, try raiding PoA without a necro.  First wipe, you'll wish you had one.  To another point, on creatures like the emperor, if the melee doesn't have a bane weapon, he does NO damage.  Casters don't have to worry about that.</P><P>Future of dot stacking making necros more desirable?  As the new expansions come out, the mobs get tougher with higher resists/needing bane weapons to do damage/more HP's.  Why wouldn't PoP follow this trend?  More HP's means longer fights meaning necros will see some real big use.</P><P>This post brought to you by the evil lizard foundation.  We sincerely hope this was dumbed down enough so people who were previously unable to see how this would make us more desireable can now understand the significance of these presumably near changes.

I hope it makes it to the live servers without dying to imbalance cries - yes, it will allow uber mobs to be killed alot faster when 3-4 necros can stack the same Dots, but this is something that must happen.  Without it, necromancers and other DoT-casters suffer with each new member, as I witnessed today doing a mob that was fire-immune - we basically had three necros sharing the same DoTs (splurt & vex) and nuking - and we know how terrible necros are at nuking.</P><P>I can see that the 15-buff slot limitation is be a huge, huge obstacle to DoT-stacking and debuff-casters in general, and I dearly hope that one day it will be fixed.  My question now is that would the same DoT from multiple casters be considered "multiple" debuffs? E.g. if three necros all cast Funeral Pyre, would it take 3 of the mob's debuff slots? </P><P>Regardless, this is a step that we've been waiting for for a long time, and I thank VI for taking it.</P><P></P><P>Etadanik the Redeemed</font></td>

Of course, it probably doenst matter that much anyway.  I only occasionly see more than 1 necro on anyside during a pvp battle on Vallon anyway.
