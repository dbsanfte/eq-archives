				First, you'll find a mini map of Castle there:<br>http://masklinnscans.free.fr/podmap.gif<br>check it once or twice to understand what i'm talking about during the explanation<br><br>there are a total of 3 camps in PoD Courtyards: Center CourtYard, Left CourtYard and Right CourtYard<br>they are all really different in terms of pathing and geography so i'll make in fact a 3 in 1 guide<br><br>spells you need at each level:<br><br>57:<br>VM<br>Demi<br>FD<br>Augmentation of Death<br>Dooming<br>splurt<br>ignite blood<br>fear<br><br>you'll summon Servant of Bones<br><br>58:<br>VM<br>Demi<br>FD<br>Augmentation of Death<br>Dooming<br>Splurt<br>Pyro<br>Ignite blood<br><br>you'll summon Servant of Bones<br><br>59:<br>same lineup as 58, but you'll summon Emissary of Thule<br><br>60:<br>VM<br>Arch Lich<br>DP<br>Augmentation of Death<br>Dooming<br>Splurt<br>Pyro<br>Pyre (if you have it)/Ignite Blood<br><br><br>signs meaning (on map):<br>RED areas are the place where it's safe to agro kite (no mobs, never got adds while kitting there)<br>PURPLE areas are the places making mobs warp (you go through, mob's pathing bugs and it warps on top of you)<br><br><br>What i'd say you need:<br>Around 2khps (i usually "perform" self buffed, but you can get a virtue, it'll help, even more if it's your first time there)<br>Affliction Haste 3+ is nearly a must have since it'll allow you to unload 2 DoTs each time instead of casting one and having to run<br>Affliction Efficiency 3+ is a very efficient tool since it'll allow you to save mana<br>Any instant cast item to fast refresh gems (even more useful if you have an AH 3+ item)<br><br><br>1- CCY<br>What?<br>There are only Lighcrawlers there, these ones give 5% AA/kill 1% reg XP pre 60<br>How?<br>Park augmented taunt off pet just outside the gate (lower right corner of purple area)<br>Pull with dooming, run a bit, recast dooming/cast fear, do it at least 2 times (after the pull) to be sure you get enough agro.<br>Run as fast as possible through the gate, because mobs will NOT path through the gate but will warp 2 or 3 times from inner to outer CCY, being far faster than if it just ran through.<br>Mobs won't warp on top of you if you're ~2 seconds above of the gate (at jboots speed): their last warp leads them between gate and the 1st "tree". Run for your life, and never ever stop at the gate.<br><br>Send pet, re-dark and start timer (i use the mp3 player) then land all your dots (ignite then splurt or ignite then pyro and splurt). Re-dark EVERY MINUTE MAX, i got up to 3 or 4 dooming resists on these mobs, recast dots as soon as they wear off, after casts run out of range and med.<br>The doting part is where the Affliction Haste comes in handy: without it, Splurt and IB castings are 4 seconds and Pyro is 5.5 seconds, with it IB and splurt lower to 2.7 and Pyro casts in 3.7 seconds allowing you to cast both IB and Pyro before mob reaches you without moving (if you have an instant cast).<br><br>Keep the mob in the red section, you won't have any problem (and it's very wide)<br><br>WHEN MOBS GETS UNDER 30% HPS<br>you HAVE to stay in casting range (100-150ft) or mobs will "auto heal" themselves to ~30% hps when they'll reach the 10% mark, and they can do it 3 or 4 times in a row.<br>When mob enrage, back off pet if mob turns to it or it will die very fast. I'd even advice to back off pet as soon as you see mob enrage and tell it to attack when enrage stops or if it's in the mob's back<br><br>DANGERS:<br>1- mob HP warp, very annoying when you have to kill the same mob 3 times before you get the XP.<br>2- Enrage, usually when mobs enrage they flee, it means they can turn on themselves and pet will eat enrage.<br>3- Defilers<br>these ones suck: they will often fear your pet (you have to build 2 or 3 times the agro you build with the others to be sure it won't agro your pet just to fear it, they do that often, EoT performs really fine against them), they'll try to fear, dooming and boil blood you, they'll also lifetap for 280hp. The spells they often cast are Boil Blood and their lifetap, fear and dooming are rarer. If you let them get in melee range, they'll HT you for 911hps on top of a double 350+ hit.<br>To kill defilers, you need a lot of hps, and you need to stay high, because a single error will make your hps drop very fast against them.<br>If they stick Dooming Darkness on you, FD! If both you and them are snared, they'll still run faster than you by far.<br>Other than that, their just like regular crawlers.<br><br><br>2- RCY<br>What?<br>Mix of Lighcrawlers and Underbulks, both can be warriors (pests and diseased) or SKs (defilers) just like in CCY<br>How<br>Same than CCY, but you pull to the triangle red area, no warp place, far safer imo, pet has to wait in the left corner (near castle wall)<br><br>The path you should kite:<br>left corner, go to top corner then down to lower right corner, and follow the wall to left corner, run fast from a corner to another and med, remember to go and stay within casting range when mobs get below 30%hps.<br><br>DANGERS: see CCY<br><br>3- LCY:<br>I hate this spot, it's not fitted for aggro kitting:<br><br>1- mobs there are only bulks, but there are a lot of it making them really hard to pull.<br><br>2- i only found 2 aggro kitting path: <br>* along left castle wall, but you'll come very close to other bulks and you won't have a lot of room to turn around (basically kite on a short line), not safe<br>* along wall from LCY xp groups SS to CCY gate, mobs path quite far from it but every time mob will go through the bugged pathing, and will warp 1 times out of 2 or 3, not really mana efficient (and to add to the fun, when it path through there, pet loses focus on mob and will go back to his Guard Here point).<br><br><br><br>XP wise: Mobs there will give you ~1% regular xp and 5% AAXP each kill at lvl 58 and 59.<br>At lvl 59 i was able to get 10% regular XP each hour in RCY (over a 5 or 6 hour session, ie taking in account medding)<br>I don't know lvl 61+ XP there, because i plan to stay lvl 60 and AA until i get FP<br><br>The best spot by far is RCY, CCY could become very efficient if they fixed the gate warp, LCY just sucks<br><br>Hope this guide will help you fly through these levels<br>&nbsp;<br>
