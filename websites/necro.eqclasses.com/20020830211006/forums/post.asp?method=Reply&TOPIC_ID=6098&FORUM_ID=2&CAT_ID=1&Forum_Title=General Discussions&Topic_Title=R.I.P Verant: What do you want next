        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> There was a game I was quite excited about called Horizons, which, last I heard turned into just another offering to the Vapor Ware gods. The premise was solid, and some of the mechanics had some very fresh thinking (or seemed to). It was looking like they might have even gotten a pretty decent PVP element to boot. </P><P>The thing that kind of excited me the most was the way they were planning on developing characters. You character ages (I think whether you are online or not), the older, the more powerful. To suppliment the aging, you build skills. Seemed that this mechanic would prevent some of the gap between power-gamers and casual players. Casual gammers would only have the time to specialize and practice in a few key skills, where power-gamers would be able to add more depth to their characters by adding more skills. However, both were held in check by the chronological age of their characters. </P><P>The only thing that seemed dissapointing was the idea of item decay. The entire theory of item decay makes sense from a role-playing standpoint, but in practice is little more then a never-ending source of frustration. </P><P>For a practicle example of item decay, we can paint a picture using EQ. Stalking Probes are like Holgresh Elder Beads with item decay installed. Pretty much everyone agrees that the ability they grant is powerful, but very, very few necros bother to spend the time to keep a continuous stock. Imagine if all your items were that way. Too much work.</P><P>SWG? It is Verant. I like playing EQ. I like playing my necro. I like the friends I have made along the way. But, through it all, I think the employees at Verant are a collective bunch of ass clowns that somehow managed to fall ass-backwards into creating successful game. Their continued lack of customer service, their continued fumbling with development, their continuing lack of logical thought leave me with little hope that SWG is going to be any different. How often can Verant promise something and not deliver and still expect that we pay their salaries? EQ is the very last product I will ever purchase from Verant.

While NWN in it's current config is too much of a hog to allow more than 10 or so running in a world at the same time, it is a game that will foster creative world, quest and dungeon-designs on the part of the player-base.  The MMORPG concept has so much going for it if the designers just take it a step or two further and with NWN out there, some of the possibilities may be put up for show.</P><P>As it stands now, EQ is a horribly static world - painfully so.  While the player characters grow and develop, the world stays the same day in and day out - and you end with a top-heavy collection of players with nothing to do and overcompetition for resources.  With some creative design introduced into a game like this players could be re-engaged in the experience to the point where levelling and power-mongering would be relegated more to the background.  Take for instance the possibility that the GMs that patrol the world now looking for violaters of the Play Nice Policy - if they and their team were instead responsible for driving the worlds Mobs and NPCs along an ongoing storyline that develops each day.  I'm not talking about the current GM-Events that are jokes.  I'm talking about everyday interactions, from the low-level to the guild-raid.  It would require the GMs having access to a new toolset along the lines of what NWN provides, but the concept has merit in my book.  Some version of this idea in different scales is an example of what I'd like to see down the line.</P><P>my 2cp</P><P></P><P>Takilth Shadowpath<BR>aka Necrotart<BR>Iksar Warlock of the Final Shedding<BR>proud member of Shining Alliance<BR>Prexus</P><P>Edited by - Takilth SP on 07/16/2002  17:15:55</font></td>

At the time I quit(4 months after release), there was only 1 dungeon in each realm that was itemized.  The rest of the places was nothing but coin drop.  Later on,(from what I read) when dragons and "epic battles" were introduced, you know what the loot was? NOTHING.  Dragon was dropped and not a damn thing was on him.  Can you imagine dropping Vox or Nagafen and to loot his corpse and find he had nothing on him.  Talk about a kick in the balls.</P><P>2.Class balancing- I played a kobold shadowblade.  Talk about an unfinished class.  We were promised spells, but never received them.  Hell we even had a damn mana bar, but nothing to do with it.  Stealth was horribly broken ie. pets saw through it, points into stealth had no bearing on stealth detection(was all about lvls), poisons were a joke(believe me, I put a ton of points into this skill).  Archers could do equal or greater amounts of damage from a distance than we could at melee range.  We were a kamikaze class.  Get in, one shot a caster, then die to the gang rape.  Fun..lemme tell ya.  Once they made it to where casters could not be one shotted, I left.  Got tired of all the empty promises.</P><P>3.Item upkeep- This was a pain in the ass.  "Epics" were attained every 5 lvls starting at lvl 15(?).  These items would "wear out" and have to be repaired.  Just spent 100gold on a weapon?  Guess what?  You had to pay a butt load to repair it.  Yeah, that makes sense.</P><P>4.Character advancement- Sure when you died, you respawned with all your gear and could find the place where you died, pray at your grave, and you would get some experience back.  But damn, the exp loss made EQ's look like a picnic.  Lvl'ing to higher lvls was incredibly tiresome.  If you didn't have 6 to 8 hours a day to just sit down and grind, you were screwed.  And solo'ing was a chore.</P><P>If Wow is anything BUT these problems I listed above, I'll be happy. </P><P>I will try it out just to see.

I used to love turn based strategy games but except for Age of Wonders which came out a few years ago that genre seems to have fallen away. Gone are the days of strategic contemplation and planning in strategy games, all thanks to bastard blizzard and their lame ass games that are nothing but constant thoughtless resource management with massive army rushes.</P><P>As far as item decay goes I've actually seen it done well in a few games. There was a mud I used to play where your weapons could break and your armor would lose AC after taking too many hits. However all classes that could use weapons and armor that decayed (mage robes + wands didn't decay) by default were given the armorer skill and all you had to do to keep it at a reasonable level was use it on your own armor that was damaged. </P><P>This also prevented twinking because say a lvl 1 char is given armor meant for a lvl 100 char, well that armor is flagged as lvl 100 so after about 5 levels that armor would start to become gimp, however with only lvl 5 armorer abilties you could never repair the lvl 100 armor very well at all. Of course you could get around this by two boxing and using your lvl 100 char to repar it but this was back when most people didn't even have one computer let alone 2. <BR>On top of that most all of the quested armor never wore out because of it's magical properties. </P><P>Hell the armorer skill was actually more fun than it was a hassle, the only monetary cost to it was buying the better blacksmithing tools. (which cost like maybe 1,000 gold, and the avg lvl 100 player had over 500k gold, most mobs you'd be killing drop like 200 gold)And the cool thing about the armor skill was you could use it to affic magical runes and gems to your armor that would give the armor special effects.</P><P>But from what if EQ2 is anything like DAoC in item rotting then it will simply be too painful on the players imo.</P><P> </font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> Personaly I like the idea of item decay, but it should be done correctly.  alot of what great swordsmen learned was how not to destoy thier weapons, and how to take care of them.</P><P>for item decay to be plausable you need skills that govern it. If you know how to proprly use a weapon you could assume that you know the basics of it's use and repair.  naturaly you could not take it from shatterd and make it work again, but you would know how it was put to geather, how to fix a wobbly hilt, sharpen the blade, protect it from rust ect.<BR>so knowing how to use a weapon or armor one would assume they do not decay at all under normal useage. using weapons that are out of your skill range would cause item decay, as well as armor out of your usuage would cause it to decay, armor to far from you skill would be unusable.  afterall, some one that has for the first time seen plate armor is going to have a verry hard time putting it on correctly.  (hell how many knights could put on thier own armor?)<BR>Add certain mobs that increase item decay.  sure, you may know how to twist your sword when in a duel with another swordsmen so as not to damage the blade when you connect blade to blade, but how do you poke a dragon through scales without damaging the edge?<BR>Finaly a crafting skill that requiers special tools.  when weapons are damaged to certain degree they are no longer usable/barely usable they would requier a craftsman to fix the items.  this needs to be a player and npc skill.  npc's should charge under normal circumstances.</P><P>effectivly this would mean that the only time you actualy need to stop to repair weapons/armor would be after a raid, or if your a twink.  item decay is a great thing to have, it adds depth to characters and items, yet it does add somthing a bit tedious to look after.  <BR>if you wanted to get technical for PvP you could add weapons desined to break others equipment (spanish sword breaker any one?), but I could really see some one going off the deep end when thier vorpal sword of anus removal gets snaped like a twig by some punks $2 sword breaker.</P><P>The main thing I like to see in games is</P><P>1) compleated content.  I hate it when you work like hell for some quest only to find out XXX item is not in the game.</P><P>2) macro's.  any online game NEEDS macros.  fully customizable.  if you can script an entier battle into a macro, GREAT!  and macros should be able to do just about any function the user can with mouse / keyboard / voice command.</P><P>3) information about the game, IN the game.  example, DAoC's trade skills.  that is the best feature of the game yet.  yet that should be expanded.</P><P>4) alot of people (myself included) have poured alot of $$ into killing brazil to print out maps for nearly every zone in EQ.  please save us this trouble, let the characters map the world for them selves.  let characters add in thier own notes / details for a map.</P><P>5) a basic text editor.  this is one feature I have said should ALWAYS be in a RPG, online offline, or side line, it needs a text editor.  so far the only one I know of that belives me on this is NWN.</P><P>6) a con system that advances with skill.  when you first start out, you think you can kick any things ass.  quickly learning the errors of your ways and how to evaluate and sum up your oponet.</P><P>7) Mobs that ALWAYS give XP / Loot.  I admit, thier is no challange for my to kill a fire bettle any more.  but if I were to work at killing 800 firebeetles it would either take alot of time, or a decent start.  if the base XP for a fire beetle is 5, and I need 256000 xp to gain level 25 as you can easly see I would need to kill 51200 firebeetles to get 25, no simple task.</P><P>8) multiple methods of advancing skill.  thier should be training and skill advancment through use, some skills you can train, others are only learn as you go.  one of the better mud's I played had a great system for skill advancment.  basicaly you had the oposit chance of you skill to advance (all skills were 100), when ever you failed with that skill.  naturaly the better you get naturaly the harder it is ti raise. at skill 5 at pissing, you have a 95% chance to gain a point if you cannot piss, yet at 60 you have a 40% chance to increase if you cannot piss. at 95, you are king of the pissing contest, but hardly ever find a time you cannot piss, and on the rare occasion you cannot, you only have 5% chance to naturaly raise that skill.<BR>Personaly I like this idea quite a bit for RPG use.  it encourages people to learn multiple skills, and save points to raise what they would like to specilize in.  the down side of this mud was that people could easly become a jack of all trades, so you might want to adjust it so that people always have at best 50% chance to raise a skill on failure. (note a missed melee attack was not considered a failure, a miss aginst a base AC was considred, or in D&D tearms a natural roll of 5 or less).</P><P>9) Mobs that drop loot correctly.  why when you kill a guard in full plate you some times get a shield?  should you have gotten all but the BP, Helm and Vamb that you crushed killing the guard.  of course some things such as that should be difficult to sell.  seriously what merchant in thier right mind would by bloody and dented armor from thier own city guard . . . . or right, ol ratz on 3rd street . . .</P><P><BR>now if only you could make an MMORPG into an OS, so as to unload that bulky windows crap, and have direct access to the file system.  with an encrypted partition it could quite well cut down on hacking.  would just need to have one hell of an interface . . .</P><P>edited for readablity.</P><P></P><P></P><P><BR><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11832" target="_blank">Bringer of Darkness</a><BR><a href="http://members.cox.net/umbrae/pic.jpg" target="_blank">Signature Pic PG</a><BR><a href="http://members.cox.net/umbrae/topless.jpg" target="_blank">Signature Pic R</a></center></P><P>Edited by - Umbrae on 07/17/2002  02:00:35</P><P>Edited by - Umbrae on 07/17/2002  02:07:48</font></td>

In EQ a 5 - year old ape can hit lvl 60 if you show him how to press his 3 buttons.<BR>It would be such a great tension if you are in a dungeon and you are super concentrated because otherwise you and your group will certainly die.</P><P>And how is EQ? You can go AFK anytime, I eat till I become fat because I am so bored sometimes.</P><P>I always laugh my ass of when I read of the l33t skillz some people think you learn in 1 year of playing. Especially when I read it on the Safehouse. Yes, there are some decent things you can learn, but you can easily grind to lvl 60 and 10000 AA points without even knowing what class you play.</P><P>Mysteriously getting items and advancing in levels has the magical ability to draw peeps attention. I think it is because you get some visible success in a short period of time. This gives people a nice feeling. The game EQ is not very good, it is the magic of gaining success. Other games will also have that and they will make things even better.</P><P> </font></td>

I would like to see a game where you could solo more easily with a wide choice of characters.  Also, improving the AI of mobs needs to be addressed.
