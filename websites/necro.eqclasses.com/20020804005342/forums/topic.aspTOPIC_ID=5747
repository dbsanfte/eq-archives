        <font color="white" face="Verdana" size="2"> I just completed my epic but found it difficult to find good information about certain steps. I decided therefore to compile all the information I found into one guide. Here we go.</P><P>Necro Walkthrough - compilation of several sources</P><P>1. Head to Nektulos Forest and find Venenzi Oberzend by the river loc -1000, -700 <BR>/Hail<BR>/Say Who is your master?<BR>/Say What reagents?<BR>2. Head to Lake Rathe and find Kazen Facae loc 340 -1600 . He will ask you to kill Sir Edwin Motte who just killed one of his apprentices.<BR>/hail<BR>/say I wish to study the dark arts<BR>/how can I prove myself</P><P>3. Kill Sir Edwin Motte (level 33 paladin) in East Free port in the Tavern on the docks.  SUGGESTION: Summon a pet on the dock and go into the tavern. A few NPCS are KOS to necro's so let the pet tank them.  Might be wise to have deflux and Pact of Shadows up if pet is taking too much of a beating. Sir Edwin is in the second room and a common spawn. Easy solo fight. <BR>4. Bring Sir Edwin Motte's head to Kazen and recieve a Symbol of the Appretice <BR>5. Bring the Symbol of the Appretice to Venenzi Oberzend in Nektulos Forest, she will return to you a Twisted Symbol of the Apprentice. She will then ask you for a Flowing Black Robe in return for some moss.<BR>6. Go to your local vendor zone or  join /auction and buy a Flowing Black Robe 200 to 500 pp.  Note: I skipped going to Najena as its a pain with all the keys/spawns that are needed to get to Najena herself for the FBR. Give the Flowing Black Robe to Venenzi Oberzend and receive some moss.<BR>7. Head to Lake Rathe and give moss and Twisted Symbol of the Apprentice to Kazens apprentice, Emkel who is right next to Kazen. He gives you in return a Symbol of the Serpant. <BR>8. Go to Swamp of No Hope and find Ssessthrass(loc 3800 1600) and give him the Symbol of the Serpant. He gives you a Scaled Symbol of the Serpant. <BR>9. Head to Chardok. Kill Grand Master Herbalist Mah'ka and loot manisi plant. This is a semi-rare spawn located behind the bank in his own building. Mobs in this area are all 53 to 57.  His place holder is a Herbalist.  This camp can be done with one level 60 group or easily with two 55+ groups.  A monk is recommended for pulling.<BR>10. Go back to Ssessthrass and give him the Scaled Symbol of the Serpant and the manisi plant, and he'll return Refined Manisi Herb. <BR>11. Head to Lake Rathe and give Emkel the Refined Manisi Herb. He will give you Symbol of Testing. <BR>12. Have one balanced group of 55+ players ready and then give Symbol of Testing to Kazen. Three mobs that look like skellies will spawn in succession just east of Emkel. The first is level 54ish and 100MR, the second two mobs are 54ish but magic works on them.  Last mob drops drops symbol of Insanity.  Very easy fight with a good tank/cleric.<BR>13. Go to Timorous Deep, give Symbol of Insanity to Drendico Metalbones and he gives you his journal. He is near the OT boat pick up in a little flat area in the mini mountain at location 6485, 3829(You can actually skip this step and do it after you've done the Cloak of spiroc feathers quest)<BR>14. Gather Cloak of Spiroc Feathers (quest in Sky), Eye of Innoruuk, and Blood of Cazic Thule. Bring all 3 along with Drendico's journal to timerous deep. Give to Drendico, he returns to you a "Prepared Reagent Box"</P><P>Quest: Cloak of Spiroc Feathers<BR>a)Get a 4 groups of 55+ friends to be safe.<BR>b)Port up to POA<BR>c)Give fairie princes 10gp(not for this step, but easier done now)<BR>d)Silver disk drops from Isle 3(Azerack) and is fairly common. <BR>e)When you have Silve Disc, go up to Island 4(Gorgalask) and get a "spiroc feather" which is a semi-rare drop off any mob on Isle 4.  *note* White and Black Spiroc Feathers from Isle 6 do no work. <BR>e)Kill the Gorgalask and port up to isle 5(non-aggro). The easiest way to kill the Gorgalask is to have a monk single or double pull regular mobs on the island until only the 3 boss mobs are left. Then have someone with DA hit one of the boss mobs with root(no damage so they won't summon) and then DA and run to the raid party. Have a person designated to hail the Gorgalask. Assuming no one attacks or assist you, the other mobs will return to their spawn point and you can easily take out the Gorgalask and spawn Sirran the Lunatic to get to isle 5. </P><P>There are two ways to do isle 5(Pegasus). The first is to use a monk to pull to Isle 4 after you cleared it.  This risks the monk falling off and losing keys. If you do this make sure the Monk leaves a corpse with keys on isle 4 which has a 3 hour rez timer so he can be revived back up to POA if he falls or if he dies on isle 5.  The second way to clear isle 5 is to simply get everyone in the Ashtray and pull to it. We did this twice and never had any adds. Just make sure you have a tank/cleric designated to tank mezz the splits after the first one dies.  Not really a hard fight for four 55+ groups. If you have a 60 chanter, just mezz the splits, pretty easy. My only other tip here is to make sure no one sits down when mobs are splitting, they tend to aggro pretty hard. Our only deaths here were some int casters who were sitting.</P><P>KOS - he's level 60ish who Death Touches every 30 secs. He does not see invisible but does DT from quite a distance. He has about 32000hp and hits for about 400. He supposedly has a 300AE cold spell, but I never saw it.  He is also 100%MR from what I could tell. Melee damage is important here. My group had four 55+ rogues so he went down pretty easy.  Only 2 or 3 deaths from DTs. Our strategy was to sow everyone, send in the sacrifice, and then charge. Everyone set up underneath the KOS, even casters so we wouldn't ping pong it.  Shammies cast slow to try and draw its attention for the DTs to keep the rogues and other melee's alive.  In the two times I've done the KOS (July 1st and 2nd, 2002) he dropped the black silk cape</P><P>Eye of Inorruuk.  Drops off the mini bosses in the Plan of Hate. It’s a fairly common drop and can usually be bought for a 10k or so in /auction</P><P>Slime Blood of Cazic Thule - The bottle neck in the necro epic. Drops off of Terror(one of the 3 golems) in the Plane of Fear(may drop off of CT himself as well). It’s a very rare drop and but is tradeable but usually only for 70k to 100k.  Terror is very simlar to KoS but there are a lot more adds.</P><P>Note: I didn't even start my epic until I had this. After I had it, I had my epic in 4 days. </P><P>15.After KOS is dead, kill yourself on isle 4 and have a cleric rez you but don't loot your entire corpse. You need to leave a 3 hour corpse with something on it so it can be revived(It will be clear why if you keep reading). Have your cleric friend camp there for a bit. <BR>16. Jump off POA and get a wizzy friend to port you back up to POA. Buy a veeshan key from the Key Master(1cp) and go to the quest room.  Speak to Drakis Bloodcaster. He will spawn Jzil GSix for you to hand in the Black Silk cape, the silver disk and the spiroc feather. He gives you a cloak of spiroc feathers in return. <BR>17. Jump of POA again and head to TD to speak with Drendico Metalbones. Give him the journal, the Eye of Inorruuk, the Spiroc Feather Cloak and Slime Blood of CT . He will give you a "Prepared Reagent Box". <BR>18. Take the "Prepared Reagent Box" to Kazen in LR, and give to him. He will give you back a "Tome of Instruction"<BR>19. Bind yourself next to Kazen in LR.<BR>20. Get your cleric friend to revive you. Assuming you gave the fairie princess 10gp or 1pp on your trip up, Gkzzallk should still be on Isle 4 in the windmill. He looks like a naked human.  If he's not up, you'll have to spawn him again by getting a wizzy friend to port you up again after jumping off.  (Note: it used to be that you had to give 3pp to the Fairie princess, this was changed)<BR>21. Once you have confirmed Gkzzalk is up, go to the edge of Isle 5 where you can see Isle 4. Get sow(potion), jboots, tboots or run speed 3.  Hit Harmshield and jump from isle 5 to 4.  With Harmshield up, you shouldn't take any damage from the drop. In my case i buffed up and used Manaskin just in case.  If you miss isle 4, get your cleric friend to revive your naked corpse on isle 5 and try again.  If you decided not to use this corpse trick, you'll have to re-fight up to isle 4 again. Alternatively there is a trick apparently where you can buy a chetairi(sp?) war staff that has a knock back effect. Using that technique you go up to isle 2 with a wizzy friend wielding the staff, line yourself up with the isle 4 windmill, /duel and wait for the weapon proc. Apparently it throws you all the way to isle 4.  I have never done this and have no idea if it works. <BR>22. Give Gkzzallk the "Tome of Instruction". You get back Gkzzallk in a Box.<BR>23. Gate back to lake Rathe, give Kazel Ggkzzallk in a box<BR>24. Quack quack quack. - Gratz Duck man</P><P><BR>General Notes: </P><P>A.	Other than the first set of NPCs, I never said anything to the NPCS other than /hailing them. If you feel the need go ahead and do the conversations, but its not necessary to complete the quest. <BR>B. 	From Step to 15 to 24 it took me 1 hour and 25 minutes.  I didn't visit Drendico the first time, I just went and visited him once when I was done with POA Spiroc feathers quest. <BR>C. This walkthrough assumes you have the Eye of Innoruuk and the Slime Blood before going up to POA.</P><P>Hope this helps someone.</P><P>Drakami Soulrender<BR>60 Warlock<BR>Union<BR>Solusek Ro</P><P><BR>Edited by - Drakami on 07/09/2002  12:24:47</font></td>

         Thank you for posting this guide.</P><P>I would like to add some extra info and correct some minor errors (heres hoping im right with the corrections ;) )</P><P>Firstly the minor corrections which I'm sure most will be aware of... but you never know :)</P><P>The Eye of Inorruuk drops in Hate.... and the Slime Blood of Cazic Thule drops in Fear.</P><P>Secondly some extra info on the Grand Herbalist Mah'Ka.</P><P>My group and I reached him yesterday the group consisted of the following (1 Tank 56th 1 Cleric 57th 1 Enchanter 57th 1 Monk 56th 1 Druid 57th and me the Necro 54th).  Getting to him was easy enough in that we took our time no undue rushing (we did have one wipeout when our monk logged for tea and our tank pulled just as a named mob popped on her - np, summoned rezzed and headed back down to rejoin monk who was back from tea :) ).</P><P>The loc of the herbalist is p50 (reading east to west) and p150 (reading north to south) - hopefully that is in the correct order but for the life of me I cant remember which number comes up first on /loc.  Also the loc is general in nature as I'm a necro and sulked around the back of the group and our valient monk did the pulling :) - however that should be enough to highlight the house he is found in on any good Chardok map (there are a few to be found on eqmaps.com).</P><P>Anyways I was lucky enough that he dropped herb first time ( as missus was aggroing on me worse than the good lady Vox :) and I had to log very shortly after that ).</P><P>Finally just to thank my group again for their help.</P><P>Cheers</P><P><BR>Myrkul Undeadmaster<BR>54th Heretic<BR>Dragons of Saint George<BR>Quellious<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

This causes Nottap Ekim to spawn on island 4.  When he de-spawns the Keeper should spawn in 80 minutes.  Assuming you only killed the ONE mob so far and Keeper is now up, kill ONLY the Keeper, wait for Sirran to de-spawn.  Restart cycle again…pull another mob from island 4, kill it, this causes the Keeper cycle to restart.  </P><P>** Second option is to summon corpse onto Island 1, create a key corpse and then use keys and invisibility to get to Gkzallk. </P><P>** Third Option is to get a key to the Monk Quest island.

         Everyone always says get Motte in FP.  This is fine if you are starting at hi level.  I went to QHs and he seemed to spawn every 2 hours (I botched the first kill attempt because I was rebuffing when he came by and tried to pull him without all my spells set).  I ended up fear kiting him.  The think you have to watch for in QH is periodically, on of the guards from the towere walks to the WK zone.  He agroed me from the path when I was up on the cliff (Its amazing how fast guards can climb cliffs).  Also remember that Motte is a Pally and will LoH.  My first attempt, my pet had died and he was almost dead, then he LoHed :( .</P><P>Suetekh<BR>Necromancer of 35 Reanimations</P><P>Edited by - Suetekh on 07/11/2002  13:12:32<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

         The Eye of Innoruuk seems to be the rare drop for me.  Slime blood dropped the 2nd time we killed the golems.  17 hate raids of killing minis and still no eye.
