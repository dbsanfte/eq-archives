[Sun Sep 15 17:19:41 2002] Gotz says, 'WE wouldnt even HAVE arete here if ZONE didnt crash we wouldnt be dealing with it, if you were going to your house before your "lover" and well you had the 10 mile head start, and a train came stopped your way, and your "lover" drove up beside you because of a DELAY out of YOUR HANDS, all of a sudden if the "lover wants to go home first you wouldnt be upset? because you clearly left them 10miles back, and the train conducter says sorry but we didnt have a train there at that time'

[Sun Sep 15 17:21:53 2002] Camara tells cwazy:2, 'they will kill Aary and then say we are free to continue our raid if we dont rock and rolll' 
[Sun Sep 15 17:21:54 2002] Talbath says, 'However, IF they wipe, then arete has FULL chance at that area'

[Sun Sep 15 17:22:33 2002] Talbath says, 'Gotz, drop it' 
[Sun Sep 15 17:22:38 2002] Camara tells cwazy:2, 'Everyone here knows arete won't listen so it's Mute point' 
[Sun Sep 15 17:22:38 2002] Vahen says, 'I would suggest a upper time limit for that talbath' 
[Sun Sep 15 17:22:52 2002] Talbath says, 'Its hard enought letting someone to concede their raid to allow another raid to get back to where they were'
