Although a galant effort to help out casters i can already safly label the new focus items as a failure. The reason is simple.

We all know of that infamous little belt, the FBSS. It supplys a 21 percent haste to the wearer. NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL THEY ARE, NO MATTER WHAT WEAPON THEY USE. Where as the new focus items, mattering on their level of effect I, II or III. Will effect different level spells. That is rediculous. Especially if you look at the list of level III items that are already floating in, most are rare drops that a large majority of players wont see or be able to afford.

The level of effect should not dictate which spells benefit but rather how much the spells benefit. Level I should be something like 10%, level II should be 15-20% and level III should be 20-30%.

Verant took a great idea and totally messed it up. Petition! Send emails, tell verant what you think. I cant beleive this is what they call "balancing"

From spells being level based now to focus items being level based. Why should a caster be penalized for leveling? This is exactly what these focus items do--penalize you for leveling. The example of the FBSS haste item is dead on. It give the same level of haste regardless of level. Tanks as they level strive to obtain items with higher haste rates. This is how caster focus items should be.</P><P>Verant is on the wrong track here. Seems they are following the level basic design of the summoned mage items. Focus items should work on ALL SPELLS REGARDLESS OF LEVEL. The only difference betten level I, II and III should be that the focus item increases in it's intensity and power. If a lvl 60 wizard wants to use a lvl I focus item while casting lvl 60 spells then he should be allowed to. The fact that a lvl I focus item will probably be very low level with lousy stats and certainly not an item that a lvl 60 would want to equip. Focus items would be inherently self-balancing if the appropriate power of focus is on a piece of gear that is relative to it's level.</P><P>Another excellent point was brought to light in another thread. Affliction(DOT) focus items do not increase the damage per second (DPS) instead they increase the duration of the DOT. These Affliction focus items should be increasing the strength of the DOT to give us a higher rate of DPS rather than more efficient damage over time. Basically these items will be useless to necromancers.</P><P>All I can say is that the Velious quest armor had better have necro friendly focus powers in the weeks to come. This stuff is the pinnacle of armor for most "real" necros out there that aren't in uber guilds. This armor took alot of work for my necro with faction, level and resists just for the priviledge to be able to fight in TOV to get these drops many of them ultra rare. We are not talking Green Silken Drapes here. Please Verant get this right!</P><P>Dornette<BR>60 necromancer<BR>The Nameless</P><P>Edited by - Dornette on 06/06/2002  05:31:27</font></td>

Buying an FBSS would take me 10 mins and 2k cash, as a comparison. I hope some of those items that had II effects, like polished mithril mask, and djarn's amethyst ring, get upgraded to III effects.</P><P></P><P>Zarloth V`Sharatouum<BR>Teir`dal Warlock<BR>Vallon Zek<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61907" target="_blank">Magelo</a><BR></font></td>

What the focus items did for us, is that we can now keep our damage output up for a longer amount of time, since they cost less mana and stay on longer, but our actual DPS didn't increase.<BR>If you look at Wizards, they got Improved Damage which increases their DPS effectively by 20%, if you add Spell Haste you can argue that it increases their DPS as well, and Mana Preservation helps them to keep the damage up for a longer period of time.<BR>Same with Healers and Improved Healing. They now can heal more damage in less time.</P><P>We <u>need</u> a Improved Affliction focus that either increases the total dot damage (same ticks, more damage), or reduces the time for the dot to do it's full damage (less ticks, same damage) to be competitive and attractive for groups.<BR>Also, a Casting Subtlety Focus, like the Arch Skill, would be nice to have, since the agro issue with dots is still unbalanced as compared to other forms of damage.</P><P> </font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> It's true that Focus items are probably more useful than FT. The problem is that putting level III effects only on uber-level encounters means that they are effectively limiting a set of very useful items to a very small subset of people. As the FT items aren't quite as useful, limiting them to a very small subset of people matters less.</P><P>To add to the problem, people who are levelling up now will, after level 49, suddenly find their effectiveness reduced after having had 40+ levels with focus items. The jump in casting times will become a lot bigger because apart from the longer casting time of higher level spells, you have to add the 33% that was shaved off the under-44 DoT. Also, at level 50, Ignite Bones would do 600 dmg with damage enhancement, while Indisious Retrogression does 550.</P><P>While it makes more sense that you outgrow items, there is currently no clear way how you can outgrow items in a logical progression. All we can see is a huge leap in difficulty between obtaining level II and level III items, with most level III items obtainable only by large guilds. Meaning that you have to be practically level 60 before you can get these items. And 12 levels (10 of which are hell levels) where you can't get any generically useful focus items. </P><P>Taking the FBSS for example, it doesn't stop working for melees when they hit level 50 and even if it did, they have things to replace it before they're 60. Whereas we don't in the current state of affairs.</P><P>Melees also get the choice to carry on using their haste items, even if it totally sucks for their level. Plenty of level 50+ tanks still use FBSS. With the level limit, casters don't have this luxury. The decision is taken out of our hands.</P><P>If they do intend to keep this level based thing, there *must* be a more gradual difficulty in obtaining these effects. Not the big chasm we see at the moment. There need to be level III items which can be obtained by level 50-ish.</P><P>Tenaiya Soulscorcher</font></td>

        <TD bgcolor='black' valign='top'><font color='white' face='Verdana' size='2'> When I first looked at the list of focus items I thaught it made sense.  By putting high level focus effects on relatively low level items, they make us choose between the focus effect and stats.  Imagine a neck item with no stats except a level III focus effect.  Would you give up the stats for the effect?  Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  I was looking forward to having special use focus items.  Like the other poster, I was giving Verant way too much credit.</P><P>Everyone is looking at how hard usefull items are to get compared to their utility.  I think this misses the point.  The game is already designed such that a player must be very high level and in a very good guild to get the really great items.  That has not changed with the introduction of focus items.  Most focus items seemed to be designed for twinking.  Verant wanted to allow high level characters to be able to easily twink their low level caster characters in the same way they can do with their lowbie fighers.  The bottom line is that the new focus items are for your twinked secondary characters but will do little or nothing for your primary.</P><P>Frankly, Everquest is becomming very boring.  I just don't think I care much any more.  Being able to actually aquire a great item on my own would make the game exciting but all of these items have been nerfed out of the game.  I am left to mindlessly grind my way up through the 50+ hell levels.   Boooooring!</P><P> </font></td>

Djarn's Amethyst, NoS are two I saw, because I have those two items.  A level 2 effect is completely useless to post 60 Necros, and probably has been for 5+ levels.  I cant speak for other classes, but I highly doubt there is any level 60 that routinely casts something that any level 1/2 focus affect would positively effect in a meaningful way.</P><P>Sayleth</P><P>And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death - Revelation 6:8</font></td>
