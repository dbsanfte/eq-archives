            <p><font face="Tahoma">Everyone knows about hell levels. 30, 35, 40
            and the infamous 45. But where are the best places to hunt to make
            sure hell isn't as bad as it can be?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">Lets start with 30. As Necros, we one thing
            going. We can always attempt to solo higher con mobs and get better
            XP to make sure we can get through the hells in a reasonable amount
            of time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">I have some ideas on how to make leveling
            through hells a little easier, for players that like to group as
            well as stick it out on their own.</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Level 30</font></b>
            - your first hell level. most usable spells: Dooming Darkness, Boil
            Blood, Lifetap, Poison Shock, Fear, and of course, your pet.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">At level 30 you have a very weak and often
            resisted fear spell &lt;Lvl 4&gt; and your lvl 29 pet cannot take
            the amount of damage that a lvl 34 can, or give for that matter. You
            will want to be careful at Hell level 30. These are some of the best
            possible places to hunt to get out of hell lvl 30.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">* SOLO * South Karana: Bard
            Camp &lt;Well&gt;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">Vhalen Nostros hits pretty hard - he is an
            even con at lvl 30, and sometimes you will find yourself in trouble,
            but the experience is astounding. Just to be safe, you might want to
            mem engulfing darkness because of the possible resists and slow
            casting times of Dooming. Once Engulfing Darkness is stuck, send
            your pet, and fear. After you have feared, Boil Blood and lifetap
            and DD with poison shock as needed. You might use all of your mana,
            but you have 7 minutes for the re-pop - So allure death, and med and
            heal your pet if needed. At times, you might die here at lvl 30, so
            the risk is moderate - but well worth the xp to get you out of hell.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">* SOLO * South Karana -
            Treants</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">Trees :) Hmm... Two spawns every 5 minutes.
            You will need a partner but do not group. Get another person of the
            same level who can solo treants effectively and you each take a
            spawn. A very easy kill is to engulf, send pet, and DD or lifetap.
            Watch out for the dots, you might want to keep cancel magic memmed -
            and keep your major shielding off. I actually grouped here with a
            lvl 32 shaman at 32 - and we hit 34 in 12 hours. So the xp is very
            good here until then. For a hell level though - stay out of being in
            a group and solo the one pop. Especially if you are both in hell
            lvl. I don't know why - but the xp is better if you are not grouped.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">* GROUP * Unrest - Altar
            room/Ghost Room</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">Although there are usually lists
            &lt;Hopefully with Rok there will not be anymore&gt; getting into
            one of these two groups is GREAT experience in a hell level with
            minimal risk of dying. A good altar group can pull from Blood pool
            as well as the stairs to the bookcase and it will make for zero
            downtime. Use your normal group strategy here, DD with lifetap when
            needed or use poison shock on live creatures, with your Undead nuke
            on the undead. You should not die here if you are in a good group.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">* GROUP * Tool Booth Guards</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">Guard Colin is usually the weaker spawn. You
            will want to split the spawn so you can conjuntively work together.
            To split the spawn fear one of the guards and send both your pets on
            the other. Fear Colin if you can since he is 1 lvl weaker. have one
            BB, and one heart flutter to bring down the AC so the pets can do
            more damage and fear and nuke. By the time he is dead you should
            have enough mana left between the two of you to kill the 2nd with
            the same strategy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">These are four of the most popular and should
            get you out of hell 30 in pretty sweet time. It is your first hell
            lvl - taking twice the normal XP to get out of. It will take getting
            used to not seeing your XP bar move.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">When you level to 31 do not die. You will
            lose approx one to 1 and a half bubs ot xp her death. Due to the
            nature of trains, try not to hunt in dungeons notorius for trains.
            As of now - the UZ bug was fixed in Cazic - Cazic would be a bad
            place for lvl 31 players. Unrest is pretty safe if you must hunt in
            a dungeon. If you can, keep to the same spawns till you get out of
            31. If you do die, beg for a rez - because you will lose about 2-3
            hours of XP in one death.</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma"><b>L</b></font><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>evel
            35</b></font> - takes 3 times the normal amount of XP needed to
            level. At this level though you have some spells that will help you
            out a great deal more than 30. Invoke fear &lt;Finally an
            upgrade!&gt;, Venom of Snake 540 DOT in 30-45 seconds, a pet that
            can tank and DW and double attack for a max of 33 damage, greater
            shielding, root, we get it all at 34 :)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">* GROUP * Troll guards in
            Rathe &lt;TOWER&gt;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">Yeah I know... Before I get ripped for being
            a necro and killing trolls, I can tell you that after 34 in my
            opinion, the city of grobb is useless for a necro. With the addition
            of Kunark and The Overthere, you should not need to enter this city
            again &lt;I HOPE!&gt; But if you can team up with 1-2 other people,
            and kill both trolls &lt;One SK and another Shaman&gt; you can level
            out of 35 very quick - took me 4 days about 4-5 hours a piece here
            in a group with a 36th druid and a 35th enchanter&gt;. Watch out for
            the SK's Harm touch, especially if you are using call of bones
            &lt;Your upgrade to Allure&gt;.. He can harm touch you for a big
            chuck of HP and if you pull for the group with darkness, he will hit
            you with it. Send your pet first then pull with Dooming. It wll slow
            him to a walk - then use VOS and nail a fear on him and have the
            other members in your group use their abilities. Do not bother using
            VOS on the shaman, because she has a LOT fewer hit points and if you
            have a wiz or a mage in the group, she will be dead before 20 secs.
            Try and get the shaman on the pop - otherwise she will summon an
            annoying little wolf pet and cons green most of the time at 35.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">* SOLO * Guards Toll Booth</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">You will want to spread the spawn here, but
            you can easily control the spawn. Fear Valon, and send pet after
            Colin, than cast dooming darkness, fear, VOS and boil blood and med.
            Right when the fear will wear off, colin should die, and your pet
            should be almost ful health still. At this point you should nbe
            about 45-50%. and still have COB on. Valon should be on his way back
            by now - hopefully someone didn't KS him - but if he returns, do the
            same as to him as to Valon. After Valon died, med up and heal pet -
            the spawn between the two guards should be about 1 to 2 mins
            apart... more than enough time to pull one without the other being
            spawned yet. Great XP at 35 - and you could get out of hell in about
            15-20 hours of gameplay - possible sooner. Only prob is - the
            newbies get upset - so if you have a kind heart you will want to
            help out the occasional &quot;KODIAK to the TOLL!!&quot; shout.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">* SOLO * Cyclops Rathe</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">At this point soloing cycs give you
            tremendous XP - the only prob is finding enough and having to go
            through the killing of the placeholders. Lizzies, bears, etc. Easy
            to do. Darkness, send pet, fear&lt;if you do not see any around&gt;
            and VOS and DD it. Lifetap to regain health. You will not get out of
            35 super fast here if you do this - but it is pretty safe with the
            exception of Tarskuk running wild on you. A named Cyclops with SOW.
            I would say you would get out of hell 35 here in 3-4 days playing
            5-8 hours a day. without death.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">* GROUP * West Common Druids</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">2 Druids spawn here right by the gate. the
            great thing is, Slea Pinewhisper is also here but never gets mad at
            you for killing her druid companions. She is a beta neutral NPC and
            you can sell to her. team up with another necro, and fear one
            &lt;They can heal so watch out&gt; and nuke the other one quick to
            space out the spawn. Darkness, to slow it down, send pet, fear, and
            DD it with PS or lifetap... By the time the first druid is dead, the
            2nd will come back soon and use the same Method. ** If you notice
            one healing - Cast VOS on it as well to make sure she doesn't out
            heal the damage by DD's and is only recovering a fraction of the VOS
            Dot by healing ** - Great loot here too - and once you get bogged
            down just go sell right at the gate :)) Awesome XP and bot bad loot
            as well - FS almost every drop and also 1-4 pp per loot :) If mana
            allows - go nuts and kill an occasional griff or HG in the area.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">^^^ Same as above except at the druid ring in
            East commons ^^^ Same tactic. except this time, when you need to
            sell - go to the hut directly behind you - and make sure turn your
            self into a skellie :) With COB you con so you can sell to her :)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Level 36</b></font>
            - make sure you try and stay at one of these spawn points - very
            good XP throughout - again - the same as mentioned with level 31,
            try and stay out of the bad dungeons. Unrest starts to get too easy
            at 36 and doesn't give the best XP as stuff starts to con green in
            altar and ghost. Cazic with the UZ bug being fixed is not a good
            place. Unless you know you are in a decent group - I wouldn't
            bother.. A good place with seasoned group members from what I have
            seen if you need to get into a dungeon, is the Bed room in lower
            guk. Good xp and you should be outta level 36 in no time and pretty
            safe as long as you stay out of the way of the higher level trains.</font></p>
