            <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I was in the DE city on the evil
            side - taking the shuttle from Oasis to the big boat... landing at
            the city of the dead &lt;Dunno what its official name is :)&gt; I
            was touring around when I ran into the shadow knight necro guild...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">FYI: Probably the biggest couple of
            thngs for necros of 39th and 44th level - you can now buy your pet
            spells from an SK ogre &lt;Forget his name&gt; in the necro guild.
            So they are no longer research only :) the 39th pet sells for approx
            44pp. 44th pet around 60 or so.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">There is a quest on the DIRECT
            opposite of the ogre SK that if you give her 4 scrolls, she will
            give you a spell that you cannot buy or research. I do not know if
            this is for necros, but I am assuming so :)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">It was a pretty awesome place! There
            are undead skeletons that pop off their heads, and are lned up
            against a wall following orders from a captain :) I also noticed
            that anyone good is KOS if they take the boat from Oasis. And vice
            versa - so necros will not want to take the shuttles from felwithe
            and hop on the titanic of ships &lt;Although I will probably log on
            with my pally to see that boat - I hear it is big&gt;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The ship we take after the shuttle
            is HUGE. When you get to the main ship &lt;After taking the
            shuttle&gt; you will come to the dock area... About Midway, a lvl 51
            SK and I found a small boat that tilts up - it looks like it will
            open something... While he was doing it I was searching for
            something it might open - but did not see anything.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Along the way you come across the
            ship graveyard. Occupied by bandits... Which could be good for lower
            level necros.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I than gated back to oasis and
            caught a GG from Sro to the dreadlands. I began fighting with a lvl
            40 druid - at 38 - most of the creatures were blue. tundra Yetis
            were pretty easy to blow away, as well as the mountain giants.
            However, if you go through a snow tunnel, you come out on the other
            side... Stick on the left wall and you come to a forest &lt;it
            starts to really slow down here if you have full clip - so unless
            you have a fast computer I would recommend turning clipping down&gt;
            on the side closest to the burning forest zone, There are lvl 39
            mobs - that hit VERY hard and fast. I will write the names of all
            the creatures and get them to you tomorrow - but at full mana I was
            heavily resisted with VOS. I dunno if this is common for all
            creatures, but a lot of mobs in dreadland resisted poison... I was
            forced to use Boil blood, and fear, while my druid partner would
            snare and DD, we could not take down a lvl 39 mob - My VOS at this
            point was resisted 4 times in a row even when it was down to half
            health. Again I will get the mobs name :)</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">------------- zip --------------</font>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">I ventured into Fironia last night for the
            first time, the guks on the left side of the zone see right through
            your invis, and hit hard and run fast. I had my Jboots on and they
            were catching up unless I jumped. In the meantime of frantically
            trying to zone, &lt;Never did find it&gt; I ran across a Scout with
            a dog pet called Dune. At 39 he conned red, his pet was blue though.
            &lt;Was a real dog&gt;. And was just a normal guard - this could be
            very excellent XP for a higher level necro to camp - unfortunately I
            cannot time his spawn - but he is placed JUST by the waterline...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">On the otherside of the dreadlands, I ran
            into some Spidercamps. Along the zone - basically if you come out
            the tunnel from the druid gate, and follow the right wall, you will
            hit these camps. About 4-5 spiders per piece all conning blue. So
            you might want to group up with 1-2 people. I am going to do that
            tonight and see how the xp is :)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">There is an Axe that drops off of one - 45
            Dmg and 150 delay! Heh so a pretty crappy axe by delay standards -
            but it has nice damage.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Tahoma">On a possible bug note, I gated back to WC to
            try and get 39th lvl... I was only getting xp off of the guards 75%
            of the time - another 25% I was getting no xp - of couse all blue
            cons - valon and col and the toll booth. The faction was messed up
            too - instead of positive faction for priests of marr and knights of
            truth, I only received the negative faction for militia... this
            happened about 50% of the time.</font></p>
