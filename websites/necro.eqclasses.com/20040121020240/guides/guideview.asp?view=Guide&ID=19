				DING 46!!!<br><br>Grats !! you can now join your first raid!. here are a few lessons and rules about raids.<br><br>1. Be quiet and learn. Raiding is a very different experience from anything else you have probably encountered up till now. You will need to learn a whole different set of tactics/strategies for fighting in large groups. Running about here and there to look at all the new and pretty mobs may be fun but wont get you invited back.<br><br>2. If you have class web-board or website (Like this one), find it and have a good read through it. You will find lots and lots of really good information about your classes role on raids.<br><br>3. Pay attention to what is going on around you. There is a massive flow of information during a raid with raid leaders and classes calling what they are doing. Watch all of it till you learn what applies to you and what doesnt.<br><br>4. Learn a little (If you havent already) about other classes. Why do Chanters/Shammies get killed a lot on raids?, ask a Chanter/Shammy one day (not during the raid they are too damn busy) or look it up on their class website. Learning a little about other classes and what they are called on to do will help you in knowing your own role.<br><br>5. Do not chat in the raid channel during a raid. This is not for chatting. This is for co-ordinating and passing information among raid members. There are another 23 hours in the day in which you can be as funny as you bleeding like in /gu. During a raid is not the time to be smart and spam the rest of the raid.<br><br>6. Do some research on the MOB you are attacking before the raid. Turning up in SkyFire and throwing fire based nukes against guardian worms is not going to do anyone any good at all. There are a bazillion websites out there which will give you all the info you need about any given mob/zone. Read one or two to find out what the tactics are against that given mob or zone.<br><br>7. Get a Map of the zone you are Raiding in if you can. Either print one out or download the in game maps that are available. Also if you have the time do some research on the zone you will be fighting in IE Plane of Fear. Find out about the MOBs you will be pulling, potential weaknesses, strengths etc. Be as informed as possible.<br><br>8. Set up your window filters. Get your windows organised in a manner you are comfortable with, yet also a manner in which you can get all the information you need in a clear and easy to understand fashion.<br><br>The following is a basic set of Raid tactics for the Offensive caster.<br><br>This is by no means a comprehensive guide but is meant to lay out the basics only. There are many who are far better able to write a comprehensive guide than I.<br><br>First things First.<br>Make 2 Hotbuttons. Label the first one MA and the second one SA. These are your Main Assist and Secondary Assist hot keys. Learn to love them. <br>For it is written in the Necromancers book of Raiding "He/She that shall fuckup the pull and take aggro from the MA, shall get his/her ass kicked off a raid so fast he/she wont know what hit him/her".<br><br>Basically the raid leader will designate the MA for the Primary MOB and an SA for any adds that may show up. You edit your hot key to whatever name the raid leader gives. So your MA hotkey might read <br>/assist bobthetank <br>and your SA might read <br>/assist Usetauntdumbass<br><br>These are your targeting keys. During a raid/group situation these are the ONLY two keys you use to target anything. DO NOT target stuff yourself by trying to click on it or using F8.<br><br>The Role of the MA<br>Once you have a target this does not mean you can attack yet. The MAs first job is to gain aggro, this may take a while. The MA will have a hot key to call the melee attack. you will probably see something like :<br>"I have Aggro on a <InsertMOBnameHere> ATTACK NOW!!!" or "Assist me in killing <InsertMOBnameHere>" or whatever message your tank uses.<br><br>This is the call for the rest of the melees to attack.<br><br>Does this mean you can attack yet?. No. Let the Melees chew on it for a while. On average I usually wont start a cast until the mob is at 80% or less. This is situational and it depends on the Tank. If its a very high aggro DOT or a Nuke, you may even want to wait till 70%. Let me assure you, Necros have spells that can take aggro off an MT immediately, even if the tanks have been bashing it for some time.<br><br>On higher end MOBS, (Named Kunark Dragons, Named KD giants and above) there may be a Nuke call. Something along the lines of "Nuke em Hard and Nuke em Now" This will usually come from the Raid leader or designated Nuke caller. At this point you can unleash whatever you want to on the MOB.<br><br>This is to avoid "Ping Ponging" (Where the MOB runs between melees and casters as each group gets the aggro.) which melees hate and can get you, and a raid, killed very fast if you start doing it on the wrong MOB.<br><br>It is a melees job to keep aggro and to keep the mobs off you. We all know that the tanks dont do any real damage and that casters are the true killers. But if you pull aggro off a MA you will not only die, you may kill the rest of the raid as well.<br><br>The Role of the SA.<br>The Second Assist is there to tank adds. If the MA is on a mob and an add comes in, the SA will peel off and grab the add. The SA will stand toe to toe and keep the add in a holding position till the rest of the raid has dealt with the primary target.<br><br>Remember the SA hot button you made?, this is where you use it. <br><br>DO NOT CAST ON AN SA MOB TILL THE PRIMARY TARGET IS DOWN<br>DO NOT CAST ON AN SA MOB TILL THE PRIMARY TARGET IS DOWN<br>DO NOT CAST ON AN SA MOB TILL THE PRIMARY TARGET IS DOWN<br><br>Got it yet.???<br><br>Once the primary MOB is down, click your hotkey and switch targets to the SA MOB. Now if the primary MOB has taken a while to go down, the SA will well and truly have aggro. This is not a license however to go nuke happy. Again wait till the MOB is at about 80% before you start to land anything heavy.<br><br>Well I think this covers about most of it .. a lot of the time you may think the raid isnt that hard, why bother pissing about with assists ... well 2 things on that:<br>1)Practice, practice, practice will make your guild better and stronger.<br>2)you never know when a piss easy raid can turn into a massive wipeout, if you follow the assist rules then it lessens the chance of any wipeout considerably.<br><br>Raiding<br>Now this is basic targeting and Raid aggro management. During a raid there is a massive amount of Info coming thru your UI. MA/SA calls, Shammys calling slows, Chanters Tash calls etc etc. You must pay attention to everything coming your way. <br><br>Try and always use these rules. Even if you are level 15 going into Guk for the first time. Try and live by the raid rules till they become so ingrained you do everything automatically. I have seen simple xp groups wiped out by someone who decided to use F8 to target or something equally stupid. Always group as if you are on a raid.<br><br>This will have 2 advantages. First, you will know how to act on a raid. Second by the time you hit the high 50's early 60s a lot of the grouping zones are raid level equivalent. So even in a standard pickup group you better know this stuff and how it works or you will get a lot of people killed.<br><br>You can fuck about before a raid and you can fuck about after a raid. <br>Do Not Fuck About During a Raid.<br><br>A Raid is business. You are there to have fun yes, but you are also there to get something from a mob or a zone, this means that as your guild moves to bigger and better zones, everyone must know their place, their abilities and what their job is.<br><br>Anyone stuffing about during a raid will (depending on the guild) usually be warned. If you do it again, you stop coming to raids until you can behave. I personally do not want to die cause some idiot decided to go for a wander in HOT and pulled a zillion Drakes thru a door. <br><br>&nbsp;<br>
