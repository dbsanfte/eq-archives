Entering from the Feerrott, head straight until you find a totem surrounded by three scarabs, then go straight.  One is a Shadow Knight the other a Shaman, both level 35.  I started soloing the Shadow Knight at level 36, with great difficulty (but a great reward in experience).<br><br>

I'll break this down into two strategies, one for levels 36-38 and another for 39+.<br><br>

36-38, against the Shadow knight:<br>

Have your best pet summoned, arm him with a store bought dagger and short sword (or something better) which can be bought at the near by ogre/troll vendors that don't KoS necros.  Buff your pet, have Greater Shielding up, put your pet on guard to the left of the Shadow Knight, get as close as possible then cast Harmshield and run right up to the SK and absorb his harm touch.  Now tank for you pet until Harmshield runs out.  He will kill your pet VERY quickly, so get Dooming Darkness (seemed to have a lower resist than engulfing and have a better slow effect, go figure) on him ASAP then Invoke Fear.  Once he is feared cast Boil Blood, followed by Venom of the Snake (by my logic getting the longer lasting DoT on him first then the faster allows for more over all damage) then Spirit Tap until dead and Invoke Fear as needed.<br><br>

36-38, against the Shaman:<br>

Once again have your pet ready to rock, but this time open by rooting her pet from the far right, then quickly target her and send in your pet, then cast Dooming Darkness followed by Invoke Fear and Venom of the Snake (no Boil Blood because she has far fewer HP than the Shadow Knight) then Spirit Tap/Call of Bones as needed.<br><br>

You can group here 35-39, which would make things much safer, but it is definitely not necessary with a little luck and skill.  But at 39, you have the power to solo both of the guards right as they spawn with ease.<br><br>

39+ at the troll tower:<br>

This is when you really feel the power of a necro, watching Shaman and other classes almost die every fight while you can solo both with ease is a wonderful thing.  In any case, have a pet that hits for 37 or 39 summoned and armed.  Buff him, then use Harmshield and step in to take the harm touch from the Shadow Knight, then Dooming Darkness, Invoke Fear and Venom of the Snake, sit down and watch your pet kill him.  The strategy is the same against the Shaman except you Root her pet when first breaking the spawn.<br><br>

Loot is pretty good, up to 5 plat on each troll, FS weapons and ring mail, which can be sold 5 feet away at a vendor camp where you can also buy food/water and daggers/short swords for your pets (which is why I refused to leave here until I had 1000 plat and 1000 gold on me and could barely move.<br><br>

35-38 I would suggest a partner just because I don't want to be responsible for anyone dying (they WILL kill your level 34 pet a LOT, so bring many bone chips).  But it can be done.</td></tr><tr><td width='98' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma' size='2'>Author</td><td width='499' align='left' bgcolor='#21456B' height='22' valign='middle'><font color='#FFFFFF' face='Tahoma'size='2'><a href ='mailto:'>Askari D'Oompaloompa</td></tr><tr></table><br><br><table border='0' width=611><tr><td width='100%' colspan='2' bgcolor='#21456B'><p align='left' style='word-spacing: 0; margin: 0'><b><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Additional Comments</font></b></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Nihilistan Uberknochensplitter</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Shiznak (SK):<br><br>

Start with all the buffing you want on yourself and pet. Stand due North of him (there is a seam in the landscape easily seen), just within casting distance (there is a slight grade at this point). Pull with invoke fear and send pet immediately. The pathing will make him run right toward you when feared. At this point, I cast engulfing darkness... if it doesn’t stick you’ll have time to cast it again before he’s out of range if you run with him till it refreshes. From this point on, it’s VoS, SoP, and lifetaps and fears as necessary. I avoid a drawn out fight on a good pull because if he breaks fear, you’re guaranteed a HT and some serious dmg if within melee range. (I’ve been hit for 589 dmg in one round—including the HT). If all goes well, he’s dead and never got off a HT. If bad, I’ve FDed and have some serious medding to do.<br><br>

Gruilka (Shamman):<br><br>

No need to elaborate.. see the other’s post. Difference being I stand to her West and pull with fear. She runs toward the tower, bounces off, and runs straight toward you.</font></td></tr><td width='17%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>Sayleth</font></td><td width='83%'><font color='#FFFFFF' size='2' face='Tahoma'>This is the last in a line of gravy XP spots that I have been able to find for soloing necros. This spot rivals the EK druid ring in terms of XP relative to level. This spot is doable at L34. It can be tricky, but it is definitely doable.<br><br>

I will break up the strategies I used based on level, as the original poster did, but first, some basics. Also, the original poster's comments are based PRE pet nerf, keep that in mind.<br><br>

First off, Shiznak is the SK, Gruilka is the shaman. They are both level 35. The spawn time is 6mins, although it can very depending on zone load, and it was even changed with one patch to 10mins (this sucked). It was changed back in the very next patch. Shiznak has a wicked harmtouch (he once hit me for very near 500 damage, you have been warned), and will occasionally cast fear, heat blood, lifetap, and darkness. He has roughly 1500hps. He never dual wields, but he can hit for 80. Gruilka, being above L34, has a pet if you let her bring it out. This pet can be trouble, as it can hit for 30s, and will interrupt your casting if you let it. The Shamans favorite combat spells are root and scourge. The scourge can really suck, so be aware if it drops on you or your pet. Being an NPC, she can also hit for 80s.<br><br>

These two guards don't share faction. What that means is, you can pull one into the other's aggro range, and assuming you aren't KOS to the non-combatant, you wont be attacked. However, if you pull them correctly, they wont ever cross each other's path. Both of them can be pulled quite easily solo.<br><br>

SK from 34-38<br><br>

Pregame<br>

Summon a pet that hits for 31 or 33, you don't really need the damage, but you will want the hit points that the level 28,29 pet has. Give him a pair of 1h weapons. Steelskin yourself (this is a MUST), and intensify your pet. For the fight ahead, you will need Tap, Boil Blood, your choice of Darkness, VoS (a must), and perhaps Shock of Poison and VC. Have FD or Gate memorized as well.<br><br>

The fight<br>

Send pet. Cast Darkness. I am a fan of Dooming, some people like Engulfing. I find that Engulfing is resisted far more than Dooming, other people report the opposite. In any case, cast what ever darkness you like, until it sticks. Be aware that if Shiznak Harm Touched your pet, he can't take more than 3-4 casts of darkness before you hear that awful noise signaling your pets demise. If your pet dies early on, gate or FD, or haul ass to the zone. This won't happen often, but it _can_ happen at levels 34-35. After you get him darked, Fear immediately. Your L34 fear will very often stick, if it doesn't, cast boil blood while you wait for it to recycle. Once fear lands, go thru your dots. I used just Boil and VoS, some people like to drop a VC in the mix. Once feared, Mr. Shiznak will begin ambling towards the North, over the hill back out towards the obelisk. You have nothing to fear from the the troll/ogre merchants nearby. At this point, tap if if your health is low, or drop a few shocks on him. Stop DDing when you have a bubble of mana left. This is the Fear/VoS reserve. In case there are too many resists, a fear and VoS combo late in the game is good for buying you some time, and doing 400+ damage to him.<br><br>

Shaman L34-38<br>

A lot of people shy away from the shaman, I don't know why, she is by far the easier of the two.<br><br>

Pregame<br>

Again, a good pet is always nice, but not as important as when fighting the SK. Mem the same spells you use for the SK, except boil blood and VC aren't needed. Get to a spot near the clump of trees in front of the tower (nearest the shaman), the angle you pull her from is very important, as it will control where she goes when feared. It is worth it to keep resist disease on you and your pet.<br><br>

The fight<br>

Presumably, her pet we will be up since you just got there. Normally, pull her before she casts pet. Pet is always the second spell she casts. She will be buffed (including sow), and so will the pet. Send pet on guard. Darkness guard until it sticks. Fear guard. Now, your pet will probably lose interest in the guard at this point, since the pet is wailing on him and the guard isn't. Keep this in mind. VoS the guard while waiting for fear to recycle. Fear the pet. Now, the pet will follow the same track the guard took when feared, that is, he will take a few steps back towards the tower, then start running off towards the guard, except he will be going much faster since he isn't darked. Once he passes the guard, your pet should jump the guard again. If the pet isn't taking the same path as the guard, be quick on the /pet back off key, and then send the pet back to the guard. Now just DD and re-fear the guard as needed. The guard will die, and the pet will poof once the fear wears off as you will be out of his aggro range.<br><br>

L39-44<br>

Now some things have changed. Number one, at 39, you will obviously get a LOT less resists than at 34. In terms of spells, well, you don't get anything earth shattering, aside from the new pet, which can be as high as level 33. He can now take the HT a lot better. Scourge is a pretty sorry DoT, IMO, and I almost never use it, especially not here. Counteract disease can be very cool, as it will remove the shamans scourge in a single cast. The new tap is a little better too.<br><br>

My strategies didn't change, except that you can now sort of hold them both. Remember though, to make this spot worthwhile, you have to out damage your pet. This means 750ish damage to SK, and 600ish to Shaman. I would start on Shaman, and kill SK every 2nd or 3rd go. Since the shaman is so much easier, you want her to be your staple prey, so always have enough to kill her when she pops, so you don't have to wait for her to get buffed and a get a pet out.<br><br>

L44-47<br>

Your 44 spells are great. Ignite Bones is especially useful here, as it isn't resisted too often and it does a ton of damage. The level 44 pet is a monster. The top one hits for 47s, and is 37th level. With an augment, this pet can solo the shaman if he is dual-wielding. At 44th, with CoB on all the time, you can very easily take each spawn as they pop. This is an amazing amount of XP, just over a bubble an hour at 44. I don't think there is a spot, group or otherwise on all of Norrath that compares, if there is, please post it in the hunting guides. I used the following spell line up. SK: Dark, Fear, VoS, Ignite/Tap, Tap, (Tap). Re-fear as needed.<br><br>

Shaman: Dark, Fear, Ignite, Tap<br><br>

This is somewhat overkill, but you maximize your XP as they die quickly. The trolls go green at 49.</font></td></tr></table></td></table></div>
